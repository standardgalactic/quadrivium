1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
Language. It's what I'm using to talk to you right now. The thoughts I have in my brain

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,520
are being transferred to your brain because I'm making mouth sounds that you interpret

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,280
as symbols of meaning. Today I'll be flipping things in on themselves and using language

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,920
to talk about language itself. I'm sure you're familiar with the iceberg format. I'll be

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,400
talking about a bunch of different topics, and as the video goes on, those topics become

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:36,640
increasingly obscure and strange. Let's go.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,720
The unbearable agony of referring to octopus in the plural. I'm a firm believer that every

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,000
single English speaker has had a conversation like this. Yeah man, so I was at the aquarium

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,720
and there were a bunch of octopuses. Or is it octopi? That doesn't sound right either.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,160
Who cares? It turns out that the quote-unquote correct pluralized form is indeed octopuses.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,480
This is just one example of how weird and inconsistent plurals can be in the English

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,360
language. The reason this happens has to do with where the words come from. Octopus comes

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,160
from Greek rather than Latin, and in Greek they would pluralize it to octopodes. Instead

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,400
of doing that, English takes the Greek word and gives it a more familiar English inflection,

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,560
One of my favorite examples of weird English plurals is what happens when you use the plural

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,240
rule of one word on another. You have one ox, you have many oxen, you have one fox, so

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,160
you must therefore have many foxen. But no, you have many foxes. I tend to prefer foxen

18
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,440
though.

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:53,480
Ah, the French. The wine, the cheese, the baguettes, and the excessive use of silent

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,760
letters. Here's a particularly egregious example that a tumbler user pointed out. No language

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,320
should be mocked other than French. Birds is wazo in French. No letter is pronounced

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,200
the way it should, and there are seven of them. It's pronounced wazo, and yes, I will

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,640
die mad about it. Wazo hits every vowel in the French alphabet and manages to only be

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,600
pronounced with two goddamn syllables.

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,360
There's a famous poem called The Chaos by Gerard Nolst Trinité, which is basically

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,200
just a long rant, making fun of bizarre quirks in English spelling. Here are some passages.

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,800
First creature in creation. Studying English pronunciation. I will teach you in my verse.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,000
Sounds like corpse, core, horse, and worse. I will keep you, Susie, busy. Make your head

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,400
with heat. Grow dizzy. Tear an eye. Your dress you'll tear. So shall I. O hear my prayer.

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,040
Pray. Consol your loving poet. Make my coat look new, dear. Sew it. Just compare heart,

31
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,760
beard, and herd. Dies and diet. Lord and word. Now I surely will not plague you with such

32
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,280
words as vague and agieu, but be careful how you speak. Say break, stake, but bleak and

33
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,560
streak.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
Tower of Babel

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,760
The Hebrew Babel contains a story called the Tower of Bible. Wait, the other way around.

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,280
Supposedly, the story explains why people speak different languages around the world.

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,520
In the beginning, all of humanity was united in one language. They traveled east to Shinar

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,240
in South Mesopotamia, where they built a city. The city contained a tall tower stretching

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,400
to the top of the sky. Yahweh saw this tower and was a bit mad about it because he figured

40
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,240
that it was just a clever attempt to avoid a second flood. In retaliation, he decided

41
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,840
to discombobulate their language so they couldn't understand each other and then scattered everybody

42
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,600
around the world.

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,720
Duolingo

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Duolingo, the edtech app with acute owl logo, designed to help people learn languages. Seems

45
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,560
like that's a strictly good thing, right? Well, the problem with learning languages

46
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,600
with apps like these is that their primary focus isn't actually to teach you the language.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,400
As with any other tech company, the goal is to keep you on the app as long as possible.

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,800
It doesn't give you any lessons on grammatical rules or structures, and instead it uses a

49
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,320
system where you answer quizzes and repeat patterns until the penny drops and you eventually

50
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,800
get it. Generally, when you teach people a second language, you actually show them the

51
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,440
grammatical structures first before jumping into examples and tests so that the learner

52
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,440
doesn't have to magically figure it out through trial and error. If you really want to pick

53
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,440
up a second language, taking a proper course or studying in a more traditional way with

54
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,880
books is probably going to be a much better use of your time. Even watching a foreign

55
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,800
film with subtitles is probably better than Duolingo. I will say though that Duolingo might

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,680
be useful as a supplementary tool alongside real studying, or maybe you're in a situation

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
where you learned a second language a while ago and just need a refresher. There's not

58
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,720
much else to say about this topic, aside from some mildly funny memes about how the Duolingo

59
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,600
owl is an abusive teacher, constantly threatening its users to learn languages.

60
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,560
This is a reference to a meme from the Cartoon Network show Dexter's Lab. In one episode,

61
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,240
Dexter is studying for a French test last minute by learning while he sleeps.

62
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,600
The recording ends up skipping, and repeating the phrase omelette du fromage over and over

63
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:40,560
all night. So when he wakes up, that's all he can say in French. The phrase means cheese omelette.

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:48,880
If you were ever a child who had recess, you're probably familiar with this language game.

65
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,080
It involves transforming words by moving the first consonant to the end and adding a.

66
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,520
The goal is usually to be able to speak in a kind of code language.

67
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,320
Adults supposedly can't understand it, so it's kids only. No adults allowed.

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,200
Unbeknownst to the kids, those adults probably did the exact same thing when they were younger,

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
and can understand absolutely everything they say. Time is a flat circle.

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,160
Here's an example. Like and subscribe would turn into eichle, andier,

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,360
obscribesay. Funnily enough, this fake language actually follows some structural rules.

72
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,960
The easiest words to translate start with consonant sounds. Coffee becomes offy-k.

73
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,360
Some other words start with a single sound that is formed by multiple consonants,

74
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,760
or a consonant cluster, if you will. So the entire sound is shifted.

75
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,400
Squid becomes id-squay. And finally, some words start with vowels,

76
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,320
so you just add wey or yay at the end, like and-yay.

77
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,520
In 2003, they actually did an analysis of Pig Latin at the Linguistic Society of America.

78
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,080
They ended up finding variation in dialects across different communities of school kids,

79
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
which is kind of interesting.

80
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,480
Hardest and easiest language?

81
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,560
A language being easy or hard to learn is pretty subjective,

82
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,280
and really depends on the languages you speak to begin with.

83
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,440
But humans are stubborn, and really love to rank things in a series of tiers.

84
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,480
The Foreign Service Institute in the U.S. created a list

85
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,800
to rank how long it usually takes to learn different languages as an English speaker.

86
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,440
By learn, they mean reaching a specific competency level in speaking and reading,

87
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,280
so it's still sort of objective. These languages are the easiest,

88
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,400
and take 23 to 24 weeks to learn. The easiest of all of these is apparently Spanish,

89
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,680
according to data from the language learning platform Basu.

90
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,360
Next, German is in a category of its own, taking 30 weeks.

91
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,160
Then we have Indonesian, Malaysian, and Swahili, which each take 36 weeks.

92
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,400
And then we have a colossal list for category 4, which takes 44 weeks,

93
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
and includes mostly Eastern European languages.

94
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,280
And finally, we have category 5, taking 88 weeks to learn,

95
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,800
and includes Arabic, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean.

96
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,040
The hardest of these is likely Mandarin, which has over 10,000 characters.

97
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,640
You only really need to know about 3,000 of them to be considered fluent,

98
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,240
but that's still quite a lot.

99
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,960
Mandarin is also what's known as a tonal language,

100
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,560
where the specific tone of your speech changes the meaning of a word.

101
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,960
We have a bit of that in English, like rising into nation when we ask questions.

102
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,880
For example, the word ma in Mandarin can mean mom, numb,

103
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,440
horse, or to curse, depending on your tone.

104
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,680
American Monolingualism

105
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,360
The pervasive meme of the ignorant American,

106
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,760
sheltered monolinguals who refuse to learn any language besides English.

107
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,560
Speak American, God dang it, and so forth.

108
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,320
A New York Times article from 2012 actually challenged this assumption

109
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,280
by looking into how the U.S. census actually works.

110
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,800
Since 1980, the census question about language asked,

111
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,920
does this person speak a language other than English at home?

112
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,000
As of 2009, about 20% of Americans answered yes to this,

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
which seems kind of low.

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,160
But the article argues that this data is misleading,

115
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,160
since asking what someone speaks at home is not necessarily the same as asking

116
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,280
whether someone can speak more than one language in general.

117
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,720
I'm a fluent French speaker,

118
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,080
thanks to the Canadian French Immersion Program I was part of in school,

119
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,400
but I've only ever spoken English at home.

120
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,960
Loads of people probably have similar circumstances,

121
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,120
like learning a second language for work,

122
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,840
soldiers who might have learned some Arabic while abroad,

123
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,760
or even duolingo users.

124
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,200
The European Commission Census from 2006 had a 56% multilingual rate,

125
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
but their question was,

126
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
can you have a conversation in a language besides your mother tongue,

127
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,320
which is quite a bit more broad.

128
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
So purely based on this data,

129
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,240
we can't say for sure if Americans really are more likely to be monolingual

130
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,280
than the rest of the world.

131
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,760
Fosarylic

132
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
Surrylic script is a collection of characters used in various languages

133
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
in this area of the world.

134
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,320
Some of the characters look pretty cool,

135
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,560
so sometimes people substitute them for similar looking letters in Latin script.

136
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,320
This is called faux surrylic,

137
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,840
and graphic designers often use it to give off a Soviet vibe.

138
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,320
Some versions of Tetris were spelt like this,

139
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,920
with the backwards R to remind people about the game's Russian origins.

140
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,080
The movie Borat was also sometimes stylized like this,

141
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,840
with an A swapped out for surrylic.

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,640
Quick Brown Fox

143
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,160
If you're familiar with downloading fonts,

144
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
you've probably heard the following sentence.

145
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,440
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

146
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,920
This sentence contains every letter in the alphabet.

147
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,960
When you're installing a new font on your computer,

148
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,880
Windows will preview the font for you,

149
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,240
with this sentence to give you an idea of what all the letters look like.

150
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,440
Old school typewriting handbooks and instruction manuals

151
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,080
also often used it as a typing exercise.

152
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,920
Microsoft Word also used to have a command to auto type the sentence,

153
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,480
presumably to use it as a font preview.

154
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,960
This kind of sentence is called a pangram,

155
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,320
and there are a few others.

156
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,360
Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,120
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump.

158
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,080
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.

159
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,120
I think the quick brown fox one is the easiest to remember though,

160
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
which is probably why it took off.

161
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,440
German is angry.

162
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,000
There are a lot of memes about German being a sort of inherently angry sounding language.

163
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,460
Science. Science. Sciences. Sciences.

164
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,840
I think it's fair to say that a big reason for this

165
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,200
is that a lot of people's first impressions of the German language

166
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,120
is old footage of Hitler's shouting angry speeches in school.

167
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,400
Most non-German people never watched kid shows inigermen,

168
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
or relaxing nature documentaries narrated in German.

169
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,480
So their only exposure to it is the terrifying ramblings of a brutal tyrant.

170
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,920
That would definitely sour the reputation of that language in your mind.

171
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,320
The phonetics of the German language also might help explain why it might sound harsh.

172
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,520
Fricatives, like the sounds in these clips, are used quite a lot.

173
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,840
These types of sounds might come off as abrasive,

174
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,560
because they involve creating a lot of friction in the mouth.

175
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,960
And these sounds also don't appear in English.

176
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,760
So no, German isn't inherently angry.

177
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,800
It just sounds that way because of the associations we have,

178
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
and the lack of familiarity with some of its sounds.

179
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,480
Along with sounding angry, German also has the reputation of having hilariously long words.

180
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
The reason for this is pretty simple.

181
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,720
A lot of the time, German words are just combinations of nouns stuck together.

182
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,320
In English, we usually cluster nouns together as modifiers,

183
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,240
like business computing solution, or online real-time cloud data management view,

184
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,520
or massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

185
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,360
But in German, there are never any spaces between the words in this structure.

186
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,920
They're all treated as one word, like bodyguard, or doghouse in English.

187
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,640
The word for glove is handshaw, or handshoe.

188
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,760
The longest German word is 63 characters.

189
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,280
In fact, this word is so long that it automatically shifted to the next line

190
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,440
in the script document I'm writing right now.

191
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,280
The word refers to a food safety law that existed in 2013,

192
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,960
and it's basically a full phrase mashed together in one word,

193
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,320
beef labeling, supervision tasks, transfer law.

194
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,880
Compare that to one of the longest English words,

195
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,280
anti-disestablishmentarianism, sitting in only 28 characters,

196
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,720
and referring to the opposition to the separation of church and state.

197
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,280
Separating the church and state is disestablishment,

198
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,200
and someone advocating for that position is a disestablishmentarian,

199
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,560
so being opposed to them makes you a believer in anti-disestablishmentarianism.

200
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,720
This entry is also an excuse to mention some of the funny German words I've encountered.

201
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
Birth control pills are called

202
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,120
directly translates to cable salad, and refers to the familiar mess of tangled cables

203
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
that you might find under your desk.

204
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,720
Or tooth meat is your gums.

205
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,960
Or doorstander is a bouncer.

206
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,160
A strange feeling of restless boredom when there's nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon.

207
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,760
A man who sits down to pee and has the connotation of a wimp,

208
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,680
a face that's in need of a fist, or in other words, a punchable face,

209
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,400
and no list like this is complete without

210
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,920
taking pleasure in the misfortune of others.

211
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,760
This is a reference to an absurdly long village name in Wales,

212
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,760
the second longest in the world, in fact, behind this place in New Zealand.

213
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,400
I won't attempt to pronounce it, and instead I'll show you this viral clip from 2015

214
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,240
of a weatherman pronouncing it perfectly.

215
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:33,280
I'm a big fan of the ampersand, mostly because it's very satisfying to write out,

216
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,520
much like the treble clef, which was my favorite part of music class in elementary school.

217
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,480
Because my alto sax technique was pretty weak.

218
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,440
The symbol itself originated with Roman cursive.

219
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,320
Later, during the Renaissance, the ampersand as we might recognize it today was born,

220
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,840
to denote a, which means and in Latin, and romance languages like French and Italian.

221
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,120
For a long time, the English alphabet actually included the ampersand as the 27th letter,

222
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
and it was taught to children in school.

223
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
This is actually where the term ampersand comes from.

224
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,560
Students were taught to end the ABC's rhyme with x, y, z, and per se and,

225
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,160
which was often slurred to ampersand by bored children struggling to pay attention in class.

226
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,320
People seem to really love the idea that some foreign words don't have any equivalent in English.

227
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,440
It's a compelling idea that other languages have ordinary words for concepts that are so

228
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,280
otherworldly to us that we couldn't even understand them if we tried.

229
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,120
It reinforces this appealing idea that the world is so mysterious

230
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,600
that it's impenetrable to our understanding.

231
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,800
A common example of this is utepsils, which is supposedly a Norwegian word for sitting

232
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,680
outside on a sunny day enjoying a beer.

233
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,520
It's a charming thought that they would have an entire word dedicated to this.

234
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,480
Wow, this really seems to reveal something about their laid-back culture and priorities.

235
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,720
But alas, it's not even a verb.

236
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,040
It's a compound noun of ute outside and pills, beer.

237
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,880
So it just means an outside beer, which is a lot less evocative.

238
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
Another one is scroyb, a Gaelic word for the itchiness of anticipation

239
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,800
on your upper lip just before taking a sip of whiskey.

240
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,200
The fact that there's a whole word for this in Gaelic,

241
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,600
while in English we need a full phrase to describe it,

242
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,400
surely shows us something about the Gaelic way of life.

243
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,320
They must be such whiskey enthusiasts since they have full-on words

244
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,200
to describe the minutiae of the whiskey experience.

245
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,640
Unfortunately, the dictionary definition is much less specific

246
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
and just means a scratch or a scrape.

247
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,720
The linguist Jeffrey K. Pullum actually wrote a brutal response

248
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,280
to this myth of untranslatable words.

249
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,440
I happen to know a one-syllable word, turd, for a piece of excrement

250
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
shaped by its expulsion from the anal schvinkter,

251
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,440
but that doesn't reveal a lot about my ways and priorities.

252
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
It is a completely meaningless and useless random factoid

253
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
about the lexicon of the language I happen to grow up speaking.

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,360
That lexicon also contains scrum, buttercup, ogre, bong, and thorium.

255
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,200
If you try to form an impression of my ways and priorities from such things,

256
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,400
you're a moron.

257
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
But it's not all entirely fake.

258
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,360
The word sodad is often described as untranslatable by Portuguese speakers

259
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,000
and means a nostalgic feeling of missing someone or something you love.

260
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,280
It may be true that English doesn't have a single word for this concept,

261
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,120
but we also have homesickness, which communicates a similar sentiment.

262
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,320
And even then, the idea the word is getting at can still be translated to any language.

263
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,680
No concept is truly unique to any particular language.

264
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,640
Vsauce, the greatest of all time, recently covered this in one of his shorts.

265
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,080
This is a perfectly pronounceable way of spelling fish.

266
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,440
You take the gh sound from enough or tough, then you add the o sound from women,

267
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,960
and finally the ti sound from nation or motion.

268
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
Put it all together and you get fish.

269
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,520
This meme also made an appearance in Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce.

270
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,680
G-E-H-O-T-I smells fish.

271
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,920
As with most of Finnegan's Wake, it's pretty much impenetrable if you don't know the reference.

272
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,800
Esperanto

273
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,720
Language barriers. There are a lot of spoken languages around the world,

274
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,040
and most people only speak one or two of them.

275
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,280
This can lead to problems, particularly before Google Translate existed.

276
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,680
In 1887, a man by the name of L.L. Zamenhof tried to fix this by inventing an entirely

277
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,960
new language, Esperanto, which translates into English as One Who Hopes.

278
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,520
Zamenhof was a major language enjoyer.

279
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,080
He spoke Russian, German, French, Polish, Latin, Hebrew, and Greek.

280
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,920
He was frustrated with cultural divides, racism, and nationalism,

281
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,280
and wanted to aspire towards a society with world peace,

282
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,640
where everybody could live and communicate together in harmony.

283
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,960
That was his hope with Esperanto, that it would act as a universal second language

284
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,920
that world leaders could use to communicate in a neutral tongue, without the help of translators,

285
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,120
or relying on one party to speak the other party's language.

286
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,920
If everyone could speak Esperanto, anyone could communicate with anyone else.

287
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,000
Initially, things were looking pretty good, and it was almost selected as the official

288
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,840
language for the League of Nations, but it ultimately lost by one vote.

289
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,640
Unfortunately, you could probably tell already that Zamenhof's dreams never came true,

290
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,080
since chances are you don't speak Esperanto as a second language.

291
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,280
Esperanto ended up getting brutally oppressed in Nazi Germany, Spain, and the Soviet Union.

292
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Mein Kampf actually specifically describes Esperanto as a threat

293
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,000
that could be used as part of a Jewish conspiracy.

294
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,800
Esperanto speakers were killed during the Holocaust, including Zamenhof's family.

295
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,680
In the concentration camps, there were instances of prisoners teaching each other Esperanto,

296
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,480
and telling the guards that they were just speaking Italian.

297
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,680
The Nazis were cool with that, since they were allied with Italy,

298
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,360
but they were also too dumb to realize that it wasn't actually Italian.

299
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,000
These days, Esperanto is still kicking, with somewhere around two million people around

300
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,920
the world who know how to speak it. Even though it ultimately failed in its mission,

301
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,640
I think Esperanto would have been pretty cool if it took off.

302
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,600
And Zamenhof's original goal was noble, to say the least.

303
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,800
100 Words for Snow

304
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,560
You might have heard a fun fact before, that northern indigenous groups have 100 different

305
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,760
words for snow. These groups are sometimes called Eskimo, but that's often considered a pejorative,

306
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,440
so terms like Inuit or Yupik people are often used instead.

307
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,040
The origin of this idea traces back to work by the anthropologist Franz Boaz in the early 20th

308
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,680
century. Franz never actually counted the amount of words they had for snow. It turns out that

309
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,080
their languages have about the same amount of root words that refer to snow as English,

310
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,080
with root words for snowflakes, normal snow, slush, blizzard, drift, and a few others.

311
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,760
Instead, what Franz pointed out was that their language structures

312
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,720
allowed them to generate way more single words related to snow compared to English.

313
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,520
Some linguists around this time took this as evidence for the idea that the vocabulary of

314
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,400
a given language is directly connected to the speaker's worldview and way of life,

315
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,200
which is known as the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, which will come up again later.

316
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,240
Over the years, these findings started to become sensationalized, with the number of words increasing

317
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,840
over time and culminating in an article from the New York Times from 1984, describing

318
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,400
a tribe that distinguishes a hundred types of snow. But this is misleading,

319
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,200
and the specific numbers are totally made up. Their language follows a root word structure,

320
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,840
so there are nearly infinite different words that you can conceivably generate related to snow,

321
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,920
or any other root word for that matter. According to research.

322
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,680
In 2003, there was a blog post on Uncle Jasbo's Gallimoffery, which went on to become a popular

323
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,120
meme among Facebook boomers. This is the meme. According to research at Cambridge University,

324
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,600
it doesn't matter what word order the letters in a word are. The only important thing is that the

325
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,560
first and last letters are in the right place. The rest can be a total mess, and you can still

326
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,520
read it without a problem. This is because we do not read every letter by itself, but the word

327
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,360
is a whole. The meme spread quickly across other blogs, live journals, and a website called Language

328
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,480
Hat, with some people creating versions in French and Portuguese as well. I wasn't able to find any

329
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,280
source on this from the University of Cambridge, but there is a paper from the University of Edinburgh

330
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,400
from early 2003 that might have been the inspiration. Click consonants.

331
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,400
Some languages in Africa, as well as some Aboriginal languages in Northern Australia,

332
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,440
include very rare click consonants. They might sound very strange when you first hear them,

333
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,480
since very few languages in the world contain these sounds.

334
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,320
English does have the dental click sound in one instance. The

335
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,360
we also have the lateral click that we use sometimes when we're frustrated.

336
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,880
These types of uses are a bit different, though, since they're used on their own as interjections,

337
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,920
similar to huh, um, ouch, or wow. Whereas in the African languages that use clicks,

338
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,080
they often use them at the start of a full word.

339
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,800
A language is a dialect with an army and a navy. This is a witty phrase attributed to the sociolinguist

340
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,040
Max Weinreich, who supposedly heard it from a student at one of his lectures.

341
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,520
Dialects are basically particular types of speech that can be distinguished from one another,

342
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,000
based on different vocabulary, grammar, or pronunciation. Basically, what this quote is

343
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,880
getting at is that the difference between a dialect and a fully fledged language is totally

344
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,360
arbitrary, and mostly has to do with the circumstances of governments and social conditions.

345
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,800
Okay, this is literally 1984. But seriously, this term does come from the George Orwell novel

346
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,960
that I'm sure all of you have read. That's why it's so high on the iceberg. In the book,

347
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,120
the totalitarian government created a new language for the citizens to speak,

348
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,680
which heavily restricts vocabulary with the goal of limiting what people can talk about,

349
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,040
including things like self-expression, self-determination, or even nuance. The ultimate goal of this

350
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,080
system is to prevent people from having any kind of subversive ideas that might disrupt the state.

351
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,560
The year is 1799, and you're a French officer fighting under Napoleon in Egypt and Syria

352
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,040
to defend your people's trade interests or whatever. You spot a stone slab with a bunch of

353
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,440
inscriptions on the side, and you figure that it might be important, so you go tell your general,

354
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,080
Jacques-François Manu, who happens to be stationed in the port city of Rosetta.

355
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,920
It turned out that those inscriptions were in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics,

356
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,960
Demotic, and ancient Greek, so this rock, which went on to be called the Rosetta Stone,

357
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,840
could allow scholars to decipher hieroglyphics for the first time, since we could still understand

358
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,040
ancient Greek. Up until that time, most people figured that each hieroglyphic symbol was associated

359
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,880
with a full concept, making it idiographic, but nowadays most linguists believe that's unlikely.

360
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,640
The Rosetta Stone is believed to have been part of the temple further inland.

361
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,320
Around 392 AD, the Roman emperor ordered all non-Christian temples to be closed.

362
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,400
That temple was probably destroyed, and its pieces were used as building materials.

363
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,640
I now welcome you to the one and only segment in this video. Weird sentences.

364
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,520
This is a Chinese poem from the 1930s, titled Lion Eating Poet in the Stone Den. Outside of

365
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:54,000
some variation in tone, every single word in the poem is pronounced Xi. It was written by a linguist,

366
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,560
surprise surprise, to demonstrate that although it is perfectly grammatical and coherent,

367
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,960
it's impossible to understand when spoken aloud. The literal translation is,

368
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,440
the story of Mr. Xi eating lions.

369
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,680
James, while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher.

370
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,200
The following sentence is grammatically correct. James, while John had had had had had had had

371
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,440
had had had had a better effect on the teacher. As you might expect, this is incomprehensible

372
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,240
without someone explaining it. So here's the deal. There are two guys, James and John.

373
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,680
Their English teacher asks them to write a sentence about a man who came down with a cold in the past.

374
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:41,360
John writes, the man had a cold, and James writes, the man had had a cold. The teacher

375
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,920
preferred James' answer, and marked his is correct. Here's the sentence again with some

376
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:55,760
punctuation and emphasis. James, while John had had had had had had had a better effect on the

377
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,040
teacher. One thing this sentence shows us, aside from English being weird sometimes,

378
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,160
is that there's a big difference between using a word, I had a coffee, and mentioning a word.

379
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,680
I used the word had in the previous sentence, and also punctuation is important sometimes.

380
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:22,240
Noam Chomsky, the guy introducing all the topics in this video through the power of AI voice

381
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:29,040
synthesis, famously said, colorless green ideas sleep furiously. He came up with this sentence

382
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,440
to show that you can construct a perfectly grammatical sentence that is also completely

383
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,800
meaningless. That is, it has no intelligible semantic content. The subject of the sentence

384
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,760
has two adjectives, colorless and green, which already contradict each other right off the bat,

385
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,320
and these adjectives are attributes of ideas, and it doesn't really make sense for an idea to have

386
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,240
a color in the first place. Next, the predicate sleep furiously is odd too, since the adverb

387
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,120
furiously doesn't really fit conceptually with the verb to sleep, and supposedly this is an

388
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,480
activity that ideas are engaging in, but since ideas are abstract, it makes no sense to describe

389
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,120
them as sleeping or being furious. If you instead wrote it as, furiously sleep ideas green colorless,

390
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,760
it's no longer grammatical either. This can help us make sense of the difference between syntax,

391
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,280
how words and morphemes fit together to form phrases and sentences, and semantics, the way

392
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,320
that language is connected to meaning or truth. Chomsky's sentence is syntactically correct,

393
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,320
but semantically meaningless. Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo,

394
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,480
buffalo. Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo,

395
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,200
buffalo. Now you're not going to believe this, but once again, this is a perfectly grammatical

396
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,800
sentence. It was first created by William Rappapour in 1972 and takes advantage of the

397
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,200
different kinds of meanings of the word buffalo. The first two meanings are pretty familiar.

398
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,240
It's a synonym for bison, and it's also a city in New York. But a lesser known meaning is that

399
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,440
it's also a verb that means to bully, confuse, or intimidate. So what does it mean? Well,

400
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,400
there's an extremely confusing diagram on the Wikipedia page, so I'll explain it using simple

401
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:14,000
colors. Bison from Buffalo, New York, who are intimidated by other bison in the community,

402
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,360
also happen to intimidate other bison in the community. Or in other words, buffalo, buffalo,

403
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,360
buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo. Buffalo also isn't the only word you

404
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,760
can use to make these kinds of bewildering sentences. As long as the word is both a plural

405
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,920
noun and a plural form of a transitive verb, you can use it as well. For example, dice, fish,

406
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,200
rite, and smelt all work as well. And that concludes our segment on weird sentences.

407
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:51,520
The English language has words like the and a, called articles. This is a like button,

408
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,960
this is the subscribe button. Articles in English are gender neutral, but some languages, like French,

409
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,840
German, Spanish, and loads of others, have gendered articles. Let's talk about French,

410
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,120
since that's the one I know best. The gender that words have in French follow some loose rules,

411
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,040
usually having to do with the way the word ends. But it's still pretty arbitrary.

412
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:18,000
For example, trees are masculine, le sapin. And tables are feminine, la table. Countries that

413
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,080
end in E are feminine, like la France, or la Chine. But countries that end in a different vowel

414
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,080
or consonant are masculine, like le Canada, or le Japon. If you're a native speaker of these

415
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,240
languages, this isn't really something you think about, since it all comes naturally to you. Of

416
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,560
course, trees are boys and tables are girls. But if you're learning it as a second language,

417
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:43,360
like I did with French, it's a bit of a headache trying to remember which inanimate objects are

418
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:52,000
male or female. Code switching. Code switching is a phenomenon where you change the way you speak,

419
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,080
depending on the context you find yourself in, which can involve speaking different languages

420
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,120
entirely, different dialects, different accents, or with different grammar and vocabulary.

421
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,920
A famous example of this is black people switching between standard English and African American

422
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,760
vernacular English, or AAVE. A quick aside about this, people often talk about the style of English

423
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,360
as incorrect or ungrammatical. Negation might sound like he didn't go nowhere, or she don't have

424
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,160
nothing, or a double negative doesn't cancel out, but instead reinforces the negative.

425
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,040
And similar to some non-English languages, copulas or contractions are sometimes dropped,

426
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:32,480
like she my mother, instead of she's my mother or she is my mother. AAVE also has an

427
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,560
entire tense that standard English doesn't have, the habitual be. He be working out doesn't translate

428
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:44,080
to he is working out. It means something like he is in the habit of working out regularly.

429
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,400
Even if he isn't actively working out right now, that sentence communicates that it's something he

430
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,120
does. It's important to recognize that this is a perfectly legitimate way of speaking English,

431
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,080
and shouldn't be considered incorrect. It follows its own internally consistent grammatical rules

432
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,400
and structures exactly like standard English does. This will come up later when I talk about

433
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:09,120
linguistic descriptivism versus prescriptivism. Okay, now back to code switching. Often, when AAVE

434
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,200
speakers are in school, their teachers expect them to speak and write in standard English.

435
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,920
So as a solution to this, they develop a sophisticated system of code switching,

436
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:23,520
where they continue to speak AAVE to friends, parents or community members and switch to standard

437
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,240
English at school or during job interviews. An interesting consequence of this is that the

438
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,440
challenge of developing this skill offers the same kind of advantages that bilingual people get

439
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,760
by learning a second language, like better critical thinking skills or executive function.

440
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,160
Any weebs in the audience are probably familiar with the fact that you read

441
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,240
manga's backwards, from right to left, since that's how Japanese is written.

442
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,400
But what if I told you there was a style of writing that was both forwards and backwards

443
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,480
at the same time? That's Bustrophodon. Each line of text alternates between normal and reversed.

444
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,120
But the reversed part isn't even just right to left, it's fully mirrored. This style of writing

445
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,280
was used for a while in ancient Greece, but fell out of fashion during the Hellenistic period.

446
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:17,760
I alluded to this earlier when I was talking about the myth of a hundred words for snow.

447
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,200
This hypothesis suggests that our experience of the world is connected to the language we speak.

448
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,600
The strongest version of this idea is that language literally determines the types of

449
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,160
thoughts we can think, but most linguists generally don't accept that version these days.

450
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,240
A weaker version states that language just influences the concepts we use,

451
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,080
and therefore the way we talk about things. You might be familiar with the concept of

452
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,000
Schadenfreude that I mentioned earlier, taking pleasure at the misfortune of others,

453
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,920
but you might not talk about that idea as regularly as a German speaker, where their

454
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,040
language has a whole word for it. A study by Boroditsky in 2011 looked at languages that

455
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,000
have gendered articles, like the ones I mentioned earlier. Spanish and German both have gendered

456
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,600
language, but the gender of objects varies. They asked speakers of each language to describe

457
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,920
various objects, and it turned out that they were more likely to talk about those objects

458
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,760
in ways that were consistent with the gendered article of their language.

459
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,520
So this shows that the gender system of a language might be connected with how the

460
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,880
speakers perceive objects, which is evidence of language impacting the way we interpret the world.

461
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,520
But it's also important to mention that Boroditsky's study has been heavily criticized,

462
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,320
and the strong conclusions she drew from the studies don't exactly follow the evidence.

463
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,240
The conclusions barely make sense when you consider some weird examples,

464
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,600
like that vagina is masculine in French, and beard is feminine in Spanish.

465
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,080
Gendered articles generally have more to do with the structure and sound of the words

466
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,400
than they do with the properties of the concept being intrinsically masculine or feminine.

467
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,600
This dichotomy represents two different attitudes with respect to language.

468
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,680
On the one side, we have prescriptivists who really love following rules and laws,

469
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,120
and think that there are correct and incorrect ways of using language.

470
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,400
This is often the attitude of teachers or newspaper publishers.

471
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,120
Here's some examples of their draconian rules.

472
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,280
Contractions, like can't or don't, are not proper English.

473
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,200
Double negatives, like I don't disagree, are not proper English.

474
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,360
This one is really annoying, since it often communicates an entirely different meaning.

475
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,200
Not disagreeing is not the same as agreeing, and famously,

476
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,920
that a sentence should never end in a preposition.

477
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,760
If someone asks you, which streaming service did you watch succession on,

478
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,640
that is seen as incorrect, and instead you should say,

479
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,760
on which streaming service did you watch succession?

480
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,800
All of these examples might not be appropriate in formal writing,

481
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,160
but that doesn't make them incorrect uses of English by any means.

482
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,800
On the other side, we have descriptivism, which is the dominant approach in academic linguistics.

483
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,440
Instead of fixating on how language should be spoken,

484
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,000
they instead focus on how language speakers actually use language in real life.

485
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,640
Here's an argument you might have encountered in a conversation

486
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,120
with someone who insists on being pedantic.

487
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,000
You might say,

488
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,440
You've read less books than me.

489
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,120
His face then turns smug, and he says,

490
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,480
Um, actually, I have read fewer books than you.

491
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,960
It's like having less money and fewer dollars.

492
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,760
But if that person were less annoying,

493
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,360
they would realize that people use less all the time in these contexts.

494
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,360
So this phrasing is completely legitimate,

495
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,280
and they also know exactly what you're trying to say.

496
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,640
Great vowel shift.

497
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,200
At some point between the 1400s and 1700s,

498
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,120
the way that English speakers pronounced vowel sounds gradually changed.

499
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,960
Here are some examples of how things shifted.

500
00:37:45,200 --> 00:38:06,400
There are a couple theories for why this happened.

501
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,360
It might have been because a lot of people migrated to South England,

502
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,240
from the eastern and central areas after the Black Death,

503
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,720
so different dialects clashed with each other.

504
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,840
The pretentious London natives wanted to make sure they sounded different

505
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,480
from the immigrants, by adjusting the way they talk.

506
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,000
It also could have been because the wars England had with France at the time

507
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,480
might have caused English speakers to overcorrect

508
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,960
by changing their pronunciation to sound less French.

509
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,920
In 2015, there was an argument in the Wikipedia editing section

510
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,840
about an audio recording for the page,

511
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,200
Bhutanese Passport.

512
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,080
Someone wrote,

513
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,760
The sound file is ridiculous.

514
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,200
For this reason, it has become a meme, albeit a minor one,

515
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,640
and the source of much humor.

516
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,400
The file should be removed until a more appropriate one could be sourced.

517
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,440
Someone replied,

518
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,200
LOL, that was so funny.

519
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,000
I actually lulled so effing hard, ha.

520
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,120
Here's what it sounded like.

521
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,520
Later, someone replied and called this criticism racist,

522
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,840
due to the accent of the speaker in the recording.

523
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,640
Removing this audio file only encourages racism.

524
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,600
You don't like it because it doesn't sound like your English dialect.

525
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,680
English is a multicultural language, and Wikimedia is a multicultural place,

526
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,680
where all dialects can coexist.

527
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,080
If this is removed, it would only aid in the destruction of Wikipedia ideals.

528
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,880
It would only be replaced with something that sounds more white,

529
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,560
but have no change in content.

530
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,200
And now we are at the point where any change in content

531
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,000
would only be added so that this file can be changed.

532
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
This is racism, and I won't stand for it.

533
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,440
Someone wrote back saying,

534
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,560
This is no racism.

535
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,520
The guy reading it sounds drunk, which was met with,

536
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,040
Maybe he has a disability.

537
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,840
You don't know.

538
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,680
Removing is discrimination.

539
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,840
There was a long back and forth with people arguing

540
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,640
whether they should keep the original recording or add a new one.

541
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,000
One person argued that the reader claimed to be a native boot knees,

542
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,440
which resulted in the accent,

543
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,760
but admitted that the sound quality and bizarre autotune sound was pretty bad.

544
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,160
One person said, I can't hear any problem with it.

545
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,360
Sounds fine to me.

546
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,400
Someone else said,

547
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,800
Strong keep purely for the historical value of the audio in this talk page.

548
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,600
This will eventually get its own mention in the troll article.

549
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,720
Much lulls.

550
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,280
The sound file is a boot knees national treasure,

551
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,240
and we will not have you committing this erasure of their culture.

552
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
After a difficult 40 seconds on YouTube,

553
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,440
I was able to find an example of a man and woman from Bhutan,

554
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,240
speaking English with what must be a Bhutan accent.

555
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,120
And here it is.

556
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,520
We touch you, maybe they don't even know where Bhutan is.

557
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,880
With this tiny little kingdom,

558
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,080
here is huge China,

559
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,600
massive India and Bhutan.

560
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,960
Our population is approximately around 700,000 people.

561
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,000
The accent in the file sounds nothing like the accent in this video.

562
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,920
The file to me sounds a,

563
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,680
like extremely poor quality and or intentional use of effects,

564
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,560
and to be like someone mocking Asian accents.

565
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,120
If this is legitimately the way this person sounds,

566
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,600
then keep it regardless of how it sounds to other people,

567
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,760
and I will feel awful for having said all this.

568
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,360
But until that is verified,

569
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,080
this seems extremely fishy and possibly racist to me,

570
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
especially compared to that YouTube video.

571
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,680
Extremely strong keep.

572
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,200
Wee you, wee you.

573
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,960
Here comes the Fun Police.

574
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,120
Eventually, in March of 2015,

575
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,480
the Fun Police arrived,

576
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,320
and it was replaced with a new recording.

577
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,480
In the 19th century,

578
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
linguists made a huge breakthrough.

579
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,440
They were comparing sounds and words in different languages,

580
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,320
and theorized the existence of a very old,

581
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,840
unwritten language that they called Proto-Indo-European.

582
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,760
It turns out that all kinds of languages,

583
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,320
from English to German to Russian to Danish,

584
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,440
and loads of others,

585
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,120
all descended from Proto-Indo-European as their common ancestor.

586
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,360
The word bear is particularly interesting

587
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,680
for languages that descended from PIE.

588
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,520
Most of these languages have a word for it,

589
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,160
but it varies quite a lot compared to most words.

590
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,400
Supposedly, speaking about bears was considered taboo in some cultures,

591
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,680
but not in others.

592
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,520
In Latin, bear is ursus,

593
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,600
related to the constellation Ursa Major,

594
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,120
which contains the big dipper.

595
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,640
The French word is urs,

596
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,160
which derives from this too.

597
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,120
Other PIE languages also follow a similar origin,

598
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,680
but this pattern doesn't apply to Germanic languages,

599
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,120
like English and German.

600
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,520
Slavic languages, like Russian or Polish,

601
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,880
or Baltic languages, like Lithuanian and Latvian.

602
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,960
English is bear, obviously.

603
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,160
German is bear,

604
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,280
Dutch is beer,

605
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,840
and in Danish and Swedish, it's Bjorn.

606
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,040
All of these derive from the PIE word for brown,

607
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,920
burr.

608
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,000
Ancient people in these areas in the north

609
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
tended to encounter bears more often,

610
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,760
but didn't use the common name.

611
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,400
Instead, they called it something to the effect of

612
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,280
the brown one.

613
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,680
As for the Slavic languages,

614
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,120
bears are called medved,

615
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,640
in both Russian and Czech.

616
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,600
For these languages,

617
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,560
it means something like the one who eats honey.

618
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,960
Some linguists speculate that in these cultures,

619
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,280
using the actual word bear was taboo,

620
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,800
and shouldn't be said explicitly.

621
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,000
Why?

622
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,600
Well, we're not exactly sure.

623
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,000
Perhaps they believed that speaking the bear's name

624
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,440
out loud would summon them,

625
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,200
so they used a Voldemort-like

626
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,680
he-who-must-not-be-named substitute.

627
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,040
All we can say for sure

628
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,640
is that ancient cultures in northern Indo-European areas

629
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,120
did not have the same cozy impression of bears

630
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,800
that celestial seasonings do

631
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
in their sleepy-time tea illustration.

632
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,800
Tea and tea.

633
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,760
Speaking of tea,

634
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,080
humans have been drinking this delicious leaf water

635
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,520
for thousands of years,

636
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,760
and it was originally introduced in China.

637
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,200
In fact, tea is the most consumed drink in the world,

638
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,720
second only to water.

639
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,960
The Chinese word for tea is cha.

640
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,520
The English word tea traces back to the Dutch,

641
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,440
who got some tea from Southeast Asia

642
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,000
and had picked up the pronunciation from Min Chinese.

643
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,640
We call some types of tea chai tea,

644
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,440
because the cha pronunciation had moved to Persia,

645
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,360
where it added the Persian suffix ye.

646
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:02,000
The critical period hypothesis is the idea

647
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,080
that the first few years of our lives

648
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,560
are extremely important for developing language.

649
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,000
If you make it to five years old

650
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,760
without being exposed to language,

651
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,200
you're basically out of luck,

652
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,640
and it would be almost impossible

653
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,480
to learn how to speak successfully.

654
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,720
A famous piece of evidence for this is Genie,

655
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
a tragic story that I talked about

656
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,200
in my psychological experiment iceberg video.

657
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,320
The story is a bummer,

658
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,080
so I'll save you the details here.

659
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,640
Basically, Genie was prevented from speaking

660
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,560
or hearing language for many years

661
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,080
and missed her critical period,

662
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,680
and so she struggled with language

663
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,040
for the rest of her life.

664
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,680
Another example of evidence has to do with deaf people.

665
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,480
Deaf people who were never taught sign language as children

666
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,720
are never able to learn it as successfully

667
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,040
as those who learned it at a young age.

668
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,760
Even if they use it daily for as long as 30 years,

669
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,360
they missed the critical period.

670
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,360
This is an interesting mystery.

671
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,800
Sometime in the 17th century, a manuscript turned up.

672
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,400
The earliest known owner was a man

673
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,080
by the name of George Buresh,

674
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,160
an alchemist and antique collector.

675
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,240
The weird part is that it's hand written

676
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
in a completely unknown script,

677
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,440
known as Voynichese.

678
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,560
Carbon dating has shown that it was originally created

679
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,880
sometime in the early 15th century.

680
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,840
It contains a bunch of strange drawings of plants,

681
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,640
astrological signs, and surreal imagery.

682
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,240
These kinds of drawings were pretty normal

683
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,160
for manuscripts written around this time,

684
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,920
but for some strange reason,

685
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,240
none of the plants depicted are actually real.

686
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,120
The book changed hands multiple times.

687
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,480
Some of the owners believed it had some kind of magic powers.

688
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,800
What is this? Why does this exist?

689
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,720
This is magic powers!

690
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,240
It eventually came to light after Wilfred Voynich

691
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,800
presented it publicly in 1915.

692
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,840
Everybody from linguists to World War II code breakers

693
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,640
have attempted to figure out what the manuscript says,

694
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,400
but none of them have been successful

695
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,320
outside of identifying the alphabet.

696
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,360
Another weird aspect is it seems completely legit

697
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,640
as a genuine language, with the same words and phrases,

698
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,800
repeating in patterns that are statistically

699
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,640
similar to real languages.

700
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,680
The writing itself is also in totally steady cursive,

701
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,320
which shows that the writer probably didn't have to stop

702
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,200
and consult a translation system or code book.

703
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,360
Some people have suspected that it was a hoax,

704
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,960
including Voynich himself,

705
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,200
but the carbon dating definitively proves

706
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,120
it came from the 1400s.

707
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,440
Some other people believe it's a very early example

708
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,760
of a constructed artificial language.

709
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,360
There are some wacky theories, too,

710
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,520
that it came from Leonardo da Vinci

711
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,680
or that it was created by aliens.

712
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,160
What do you think the deal with this manuscript is?

713
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,360
Leave a comment down below.

714
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,720
Tokipona is a constructed language or conlang,

715
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,480
as the community likes to call them.

716
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,800
It was created in 2001 by the Canadian linguist Sonia Lang.

717
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,640
Out of all the constructed languages,

718
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,560
this one is probably the most popular.

719
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,640
It's known for being very minimalistic

720
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,040
and has less than 200 words.

721
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,280
To actually describe anything complicated,

722
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,160
you need to break it down into much simpler terms.

723
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,520
Sonia Lang wrote,

724
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,520
If English is a thick novel, then Tokipona is a haiku.

725
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,120
The reason this language was created

726
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,440
and why it's used is also pretty interesting.

727
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,520
It's almost a philosophical language.

728
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,080
Sonia Lang developed it during a period of depression

729
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,400
and used Tokipona to help her through it.

730
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,080
Its simplicity was designed

731
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,560
to help you concentrate on the simple things in life.

732
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,360
As you work through communicating complex ideas

733
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,680
by breaking them down into simpler ideas,

734
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,920
you realize the underlying simplicity

735
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,240
of what you initially thought was complicated.

736
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,880
The Sapir-Warf hypothesis is tied to this, too,

737
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,240
which was that idea I mentioned

738
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,800
that language affects the way we interface with the world.

739
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,600
The structure of Tokipona supposedly influences us

740
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,040
to think more positively.

741
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,160
If you want to learn more,

742
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,640
I would recommend the video series about Tokipona

743
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,960
by the fantastic YouTuber Iyan Masali.

744
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,680
This is a wug.

745
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,480
This is a wug.

746
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,560
Now there is another one.

747
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,000
There are two of them.

748
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,080
There are two wugs.

749
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,480
This is a test created in 1958 by John Berco Gleason

750
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,600
to look at how children acquire plural rules in language.

751
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,240
Importantly, wug is not a real word,

752
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,160
so they aren't testing whether children heard

753
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,160
how someone else formed that plural.

754
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,920
The child is forced to infer

755
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,680
how the plural should sound,

756
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,720
showing that they understand a basic, more underlying rule.

757
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,720
It turns out that even really young kids

758
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,760
are able to produce these kinds of plurals for pseudo words,

759
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,520
which demonstrates that they're establishing

760
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,840
a general structure for how language works,

761
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,240
without someone explicitly teaching it to them.

762
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
If kids are really, really young,

763
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,280
they can do this with real words, but not pseudo words,

764
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,160
so children first start by memorizing plurals

765
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,240
before understanding the general pattern.

766
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,760
The popularity of the wug test has also resulted in some memes.

767
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,280
The logo for r slash linguistics is also a wug.

768
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,280
The wug had a surge of interest recently,

769
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,600
after a company started selling wug merch

770
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,200
without Gleason's permission.

771
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,960
Gleason replied on Twitter suggesting

772
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,760
that people buy wug merch from her website instead.

773
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,440
The company had originally claimed

774
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,880
that the design was public domain, and Gleason disagreed.

775
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,400
This ultimately resulted in a long legal battle full of drama.

776
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,720
If you're interested, I've linked this medium article

777
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,560
documenting the whole thing in the description.

778
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,440
Cockney rhyming slang.

779
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,880
Have you ever wondered where the expression

780
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,640
blowing a raspberry comes from?

781
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,600
Turns out that it's connected to the cockney accent in England,

782
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,280
mostly in the east end of London,

783
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,760
which has an absolutely ridiculous slang.

784
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,880
It basically involves replacing a word with two words,

785
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,640
where the last word rhymes with the word

786
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,080
you're actually trying to say,

787
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,240
and then usually leaving out the rhyming word.

788
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,680
So unless we intend to do this job in Reno, we're in Barney.

789
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,080
Barney Rubble.

790
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,560
Trouble.

791
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,280
So if you want a nice cold beverage from the fridge,

792
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,960
you might ask for a Brittany,

793
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,680
since Brittany Spears rhymes with beers.

794
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,360
If you're calling for your buddy, you might say,

795
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,640
hey China, since China Plate rhymes with mate.

796
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,520
If someone isn't telling you the truth, that's porkies.

797
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,680
Pork pies rhymes with lies.

798
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,360
If you're out late at night with the boys

799
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,440
and have to return to your spouse at home,

800
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,840
you say, I got to get back to the trouble,

801
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,480
since trouble and strife rhymes with wife.

802
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,560
If you're admiring your friend's new chain,

803
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,640
you tell him nice Tom, since Tom Foolery rhymes with jewelry.

804
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,400
So how about blowing a raspberry?

805
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,880
Well, raspberry tart rhymes with fart.

806
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,560
Some of them are even more complicated than this.

807
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,960
Someone might call their butt their heiress.

808
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,400
The original rhyme was bottle and glass to rhyme with ass,

809
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,520
but then bottle was rhymed with Aristotle to get heiress.

810
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,920
Piraha is one of the most interesting languages of all time.

811
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,040
It's spoken by an indigenous group of about 700 people

812
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,640
living in the Brazilian jungle.

813
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,120
The first notable fact is that it only has eight consonants and three vowels,

814
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,040
making it one of the most simple sound systems out of any known language.

815
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,120
It also has some of the rarest sounds,

816
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,200
one of which sounds like blowing a raspberry.

817
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,520
But the limited set of sounds isn't a problem,

818
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,000
since it incorporates a lot of different tones

819
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,840
that allow it to be sung, hummed, or whistled in conversation.

820
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,120
And here's the big one.

821
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,160
Piraha doesn't have any words for numbers.

822
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,640
It does have words for vague quantities,

823
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,600
like a small size or amount, or a bit of a larger size or amount, and a bunch.

824
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,880
So how do they count?

825
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,920
Well, some anthropological evidence seems to suggest

826
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,680
that they simply don't.

827
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,320
At one point, their counting skills were put to a test.

828
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,600
Objects like batteries were placed on a table in a line,

829
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,360
and the Piraha were asked to make a second line just like the first.

830
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,960
This was no problem for them.

831
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,640
Then, a line of objects was created again, hidden from view,

832
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,720
and they were asked to do the same thing.

833
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,640
They were able to do it accurately if there were only two or three objects in the set,

834
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,760
but anything above that resulted in a lot of mistakes.

835
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,760
This indicates that they aren't precisely counting at all during this task,

836
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,480
and instead they're just kind of visually estimating it.

837
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,080
So presumably, counting was never super important for the Piraha,

838
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,600
so they never ended up developing it.

839
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:17,760
Research from MIT indicates the Pidaha may be the only culture on earth without any numeracy.

840
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,400
The Pidaha don't have numbers because they don't need them.

841
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,080
They survive just fine without them.

842
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,760
In a way, this seems like a pretty comfy way to live.

843
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,800
They aren't concerned about their bank balance, their follower count,

844
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,280
their heart rate, or how many calories they've eaten.

845
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,400
If they were watching a sports game, they wouldn't care about the score.

846
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,080
They'd just sit back and enjoy the game.

847
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,200
Volapuk is a constructed language that was created a few years before Esperanto,

848
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,040
but for very different reasons.

849
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,120
Zamenhof had a dream that an international language would bring people together

850
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,360
and help strive towards world peace.

851
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,320
But Volapuk's creator, Johann Martin Schleyer,

852
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:02,080
had a dream where God specifically told him that his destiny was to create an international language.

853
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,680
Yes, the actual reason was that it was revealed to him in a dream.

854
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,040
He was a Catholic priest, too, so he decided to go for it.

855
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,520
It picked up some steam for a while, but slowly started to fade after Esperanto dropped.

856
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,240
By 1890, the community was stuck inflighting,

857
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,880
mostly because Schleyer refused to allow anyone other than himself to create new words.

858
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,080
Loads of sub-languages were created, like Nalbino,

859
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:29,600
Balta, Bopal, Speline, Dil, and Orba, but they were almost immediately forgotten.

860
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,320
These days, Volapuk is basically dead, with only around 20 speakers worldwide.

861
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,680
Funnily enough, in Esperanto, the word Volapukajo,

862
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,120
a reference to this language, means nonsense or gibberish.

863
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,960
If you've ever done any graphic design or web development before,

864
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,160
you're probably familiar with this famous placeholder text.

865
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,280
Designers use it so that they can get a sense of what large blocks of text will look like on screen,

866
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,600
without needing to have any actual content.

867
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,520
The text itself comes from Definibus Bonorum Amalorum,

868
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,200
a Socratic dialogue from 45 BCE, by Cicero.

869
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,440
But the version you see today was changed.

870
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,160
Words were swapped out, deleted, and added,

871
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,120
so the final version doesn't actually make any sense in Latin.

872
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,280
The first bit, Loren Ipsum, was originally Dolorum Ipsum,

873
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,640
meaning pain itself, which is probably a relatable phrase

874
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,120
if you're trying to center a div element on a web page.

875
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,160
I think this one was included because it just sounds funny.

876
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,680
It's a fruit dish from Denmark that means red porridge with cream.

877
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,800
This is a Hawaiian Christmas song that was famously recorded by Bing Crosby.

878
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,000
Since the Hawaiian language doesn't use the same sounds as English,

879
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,320
the pronunciation had to be approximated.

880
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,760
In particular, the R and S sounds had to be adjusted,

881
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,800
so Merry Christmas became Mele Kalikimaka.

882
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,920
This one is just a meme about a difficult to pronounce Eastern European name.

883
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,640
Once again, we're brought back to the Sapir-Warf hypothesis.

884
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,320
In the 1940s, Warf was working on his linguistic theories,

885
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,560
and studying a language from the Hopi people, a Native American group in Arizona.

886
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,760
It seemed to him that their language was missing a key feature.

887
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,840
They didn't seem to have any words or grammar related to time.

888
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:34,080
He concluded that they have no general notion or intuition of time as a smooth flowing continuum,

889
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,960
in which everything in the universe proceeds at equal rate,

890
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,480
out of a future, through the present, into a past.

891
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,400
If this was true, this would be fantastic news for his hypothesis,

892
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,320
since it shows a direct connection between their language and their view of the world.

893
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,800
It was a bit too good to be true, though, and it was later proven wrong by Eckhart Malotki,

894
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,200
who ended up finding tons of examples of words and grammar in the Hopi language

895
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,280
that involved relations across time.

896
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,840
The issue was that while the tense system in English emphasizes past and non-past,

897
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,600
the Hopi language is oriented towards future and non-future.

898
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:13,600
The myth still lives on, though, with smug new-agers saying that Westerners are too obsessed with time,

899
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,840
always carrying a watch to keep track of it.

900
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,040
Meanwhile, the virtuous Hopi people just go with the flow, man.

901
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,360
Kiki Bubba

902
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,480
If you've seen my video on the philosophy of color, you're already familiar with this.

903
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,680
If I show you these two shapes, which one would you call Kiki, and which one would you call Bubba?

904
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,800
Strangely enough, almost everyone who has asked this question, no matter their cultural heritage

905
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,760
or language, calls the spiky shape Kiki and the bulbous shape Bubba.

906
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,960
Some languages seem to resist this effect, though, like Mandarin Chinese, Turkish, and Romanian.

907
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,840
In these cases, there always seems to be a good reason, though.

908
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,720
Romanian already has a word that sounds like Bubba, and it refers to a kind of sharp pain,

909
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,200
which might remind them more of the spiky shape.

910
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,560
Turkish has a word for babies and other cute things, so this might not fit quite right with the spiky shape.

911
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:07,440
And in Mandarin Chinese, the syllables in Bubba and Kiki aren't really found in the language,

912
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,680
so both words might just sound weird.

913
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,720
There are a few ideas for why this phenomenon might be happening.

914
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,640
It could just be related to the way our mouths move when we say each word.

915
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,600
When we say Bubba, our mouth is forced to be more rounded, whereas when we say Kiki,

916
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,440
it's more angular and tight.

917
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,880
A more wild speculation has to do with the way we evolved and how sound tends to travel.

918
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,080
If you're in a cave with a really smooth interior surface,

919
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,480
sounds are probably more bassy and echo-y.

920
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,760
If you're in a cave with a bunch of stalactites and rough surfaces,

921
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,400
sounds are probably a lot thinner and tinny.

922
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,200
This kind of primordial association might be connected to the Bubba-Kiki thing.

923
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,840
This phenomenon is really interesting for linguists,

924
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:52,800
since it seems to show that the words we use for things are not entirely arbitrary.

925
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,640
There might be some connection between the sound of the word and the thing itself.

926
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,040
You're old.

927
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,680
Ye old tavern, ye old shop.

928
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,960
These whimsical phrases evoke a quaint medieval village

929
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,440
before the times of strip malls, parking lots, and concrete hellscapes.

930
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,800
But it turns out old English wasn't actually like this at all.

931
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,880
Old with an E on the end wasn't really used much until the 19th century.

932
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,440
Instead, it was often spelt in ways like this.

933
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,760
And in older forms of English, an E was often stuck at the end of words.

934
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,040
So old was used to harken back to that tradition.

935
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,280
And ye has even less basis in history.

936
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,120
It's meant to be a translation of the,

937
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,000
and comes from the old English word spelt like this.

938
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,480
But that first character isn't a Y sound.

939
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,240
It's a thorn character that's pronounced like TH.

940
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,200
When this guy introduced the printing press to England in 1474,

941
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,280
it didn't have a thorn character.

942
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,920
So Y was substituted in its place.

943
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,080
Over time, this switcheroo was forgotten once we started writing TH.

944
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,960
So ye is often remembered as an early version of the.

945
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:10,080
In the 50s, the sci-fi author and sociologist Dr. James Cook Brown

946
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,240
constructed a language called Loglan,

947
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,280
and based it on the rules of formal predicate logic used by analytic philosophers.

948
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,320
The language was designed so that statements were as unambiguous and clear as possible.

949
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,520
His hope was that if he trained people to speak Loglan,

950
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,840
he might turn them into more logical thinkers,

951
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,440
which might have been a strong piece of evidence for the superior wharf hypothesis.

952
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,080
As is the case with most constructed languages,

953
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,400
the community of speakers is pretty niche,

954
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,360
and there are probably fewer than 100 people in the world

955
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,360
that use Loglan in some capacity.

956
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,960
Language is one of the most diverse and complex human characteristics,

957
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,880
which makes it really interesting to study.

958
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,640
But it also creates a problem.

959
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,040
Oftentimes, we have to talk to people that don't speak the same language as us.

960
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,800
Without Esperanto or Google Translate, that's where pigeons come in.

961
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,040
Pigeons are basically what happens when you smash two different languages together.

962
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,480
It's a simplified combination of the vocabulary of each language

963
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,920
that usually ditches all the complicated grammar on either side.

964
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,440
These kinds of languages emerged quite a lot when European settlers

965
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,920
started to trade with other communities of people.

966
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,680
There have also been instances where pigeons start to develop even further.

967
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,720
In Haiti, a pigeon emerged between French colonists

968
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,040
and enslaved Africans on the plantations,

969
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,280
and over the years it eventually transformed

970
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,320
into one of Haiti's official languages, Haitian Creole.

971
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,880
During Napoleon's invasion of Germany, he was served a meal with rye bread.

972
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,840
He hated it so much that he called it paipournicole,

973
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,280
or bread for Nicole, Nicole being the name of his horse.

974
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,240
Over time, this eventually turned into pumpernickel.

975
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,120
But here's the thing, none of this actually happened.

976
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,680
This is an example of a folk etymology.

977
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,240
A nice story told over a drink with friends that explains where a word originated.

978
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,360
Generally, the actual etymology is a bit less exciting.

979
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,920
In pumpernickel's case, it came from the German word pumpern to break wind,

980
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,680
and nickel for rascal.

981
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,840
So even this origin doesn't seem very kind to this particular type of bread.

982
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,240
Another example is the word crap, which supposedly came from Thomas Crapper,

983
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,760
the inventor of the toilet.

984
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,560
It turns out that Crapper did have a toilet business,

985
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:27,200
but both toilets and the word crap existed long before he was born.

986
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,280
Emoji is another interesting case.

987
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,760
You might think that it's related to the word emoticon,

988
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,640
but they actually developed totally independently.

989
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,920
Emojicon is a portmanteau of emotion and icon,

990
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:44,000
but emoji comes from a Japanese portmanteau of E, picture, and moji, character.

991
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,520
There's also hamburger.

992
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,040
Naturally, you might think this is a combination of ham and burger,

993
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,800
but this doesn't really make sense since most hamburgers are made of beef.

994
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:57,040
Some have speculated, well, actually, it comes from the German city Hamburg,

995
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:02,000
but strangely, there isn't any evidence that this dish originated in Hamburg at all.

996
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,720
The last one I'll mention here involves the Queen of Scots, Mary, who was sick at one point.

997
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:11,040
Her maid had said, Marie est malade, meaning Mary is sick,

998
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,080
so then she was brought preserved fruit to brighten her spirits, hence marmalade.

999
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,040
But once again, the real story is a bit less evocative.

1000
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,200
It actually comes from the Portuguese word marmalada, referring to a kind of jam.

1001
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,120
In La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands in Spain,

1002
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:42,240
speakers there can communicate in a variation of Spanish, composed entirely of whistling.

1003
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,520
What?

1004
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,720
The reason this language emerged is because this island is full of huge ravines and valleys,

1005
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,600
so by whistling in this way, you could communicate over distances up to five kilometers,

1006
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,560
since the sound echoes through the surfaces of the terrain.

1007
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,920
This type of whistling language was originally used by the Guanches,

1008
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,920
the indigenous people of the Canary Islands, and was picked up by the Spanish settlers.

1009
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,040
If you've ever heard someone from Spain speaking Spanish,

1010
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:18,240
you may have noticed that it sounds a bit different compared to Latin America.

1011
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,880
This has been referred to as the Spanish lisp. Ceceo literally means lisp.

1012
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,800
They tend to pronounce the letters Z and C as a F sound, if it comes before E or I,

1013
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,840
while most other Spanish speakers use an S sound. Cielo versus Cielo.

1014
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,480
There's also a widespread myth for why this happened.

1015
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,520
The story goes that a Spanish king once had a lisp, and his fragile ego resulted in him

1016
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,120
declaring that the entire population ought to speak like he does.

1017
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:49,280
But this doesn't make any sense, since the lisp only applies situationally.

1018
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:54,240
They don't say Espanja, they say Espana, and also the Th sound

1019
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,880
develops centuries after the reign of the king with the lisp, Peter of Castile.

1020
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,520
It turns out that the southern Spanish speakers didn't tend to use this pronunciation,

1021
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,200
and that was the variation of Spanish that was passed on to Latin America,

1022
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,240
so it was just the natural evolutionary process of language,

1023
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,840
where different systems of pronunciation emerged in different speaking communities.

1024
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:23,520
So if all these languages descended from the hypothesized proto-Indo-European language,

1025
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,120
where did that language come from?

1026
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:30,160
In the 1950s, the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas had an idea about this.

1027
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,160
She figured that a group of herders in the grasslands of modern-day Ukraine

1028
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,320
were the original speakers of PIE. These folks had domesticated the horse,

1029
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:42,320
and developed early forms of chariots, which seemed to have helped them expand.

1030
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,640
DNA studies from human bones around this time show that these people's genes had

1031
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,000
replaced about three-quarters of the human gene pool in Europe.

1032
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,840
So as the theory goes, this cultural expansion explains why their proto-Indo-European language

1033
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,960
became so influential to all the other languages in this region.

1034
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,880
We all know that English is top dog when it comes to clout on the world stage,

1035
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,720
which leads to tons of languages around the world borrowing English words.

1036
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,360
Wasayego is the Japanese version of this.

1037
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,440
Here are some interesting examples I found.

1038
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,480
Corn dog is

1039
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,640
Alcohol is

1040
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,800
A collab, or collaboration, is

1041
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,840
Other YouTubers feel free to hit me up if you want to do one.

1042
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,720
Hamburger is

1043
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,600
Hip hop is

1044
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,720
Keyboard is

1045
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,680
Skateboard is

1046
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,240
Twitter is

1047
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,360
Here's one you might recognize,

1048
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,800
for Family Computer. This was the original name of the NES in Japan.

1049
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,200
Another one is Pokémon, from Pocket Monster.

1050
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,400
Some of these terms are portmontos, or phrases that don't exist in English in the first place,

1051
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,480
and are described as pseudo-lone words.

1052
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,760
This comes from cunning, and is often used in the context of cheating on tests.

1053
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,800
This one comes from handle keeper, meaning designated driver,

1054
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,040
with the handle referring to the steering wheel.

1055
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:17,280
These lone words are also often used for slang, to speak about taboo topics.

1056
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,320
For love hotel.

1057
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,520
For car sex.

1058
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,120
For happy ending.

1059
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,080
I think this one goes without saying.

1060
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,040
Sliker is fable.

1061
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,280
So at this point in the video, we know that Proto-Indo-European was pretty important for

1062
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,080
how a lot of languages look today, and we also have a general idea of where it probably came from.

1063
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,080
But what did it actually look like?

1064
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:52,400
Well, in 1868, the linguist August Schleicher reconstructed a full text from Proto-Indo-European,

1065
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,520
known as The Sheep and the Horses. This is what it looks like.

1066
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:04,800
The word wolf in English can be traced back to the word Wilkwos from Proto-Indo-European,

1067
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,680
which was then shifted to Wolpaz in the Germanic languages, and then Wolfaz.

1068
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,560
This led to the Icelandic word Ulfer, the word Olv in Danish and Norwegian,

1069
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,640
Wolf with a U in Old English and Modern German, and finally Wolf.

1070
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:23,920
But in Swedish, this pattern is broken. Despite being a descendant of Proto-Indo-European

1071
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,840
in the Germanic tree, they use the word Varg. This comes from the Norse word Varger,

1072
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,200
an outcast of society for murder or oath breaking.

1073
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,400
This word also exists in other descendants of PIE, like Vrag for enemy in Russian,

1074
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,760
or Warg in Old English, which Tolkien used for the wolf monsters in The Lord of the Rings.

1075
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,320
Similar to the bear taboo, this is likely the result of a tradition where wolves were seen as

1076
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,640
dangerous enemies, so we ought not to speak their name to avoid summoning them.

1077
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,840
As for the taboo in Latin specifically, Wilkwos was shifted to Wilpo in Germanic,

1078
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:02,800
which was reversed to form Lupo, resulting in the Latin word Lupus for wolf.

1079
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,920
This is interesting because it only involves shifting the word around,

1080
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:11,280
rather than creating an entirely new word. This guy Chuck on a linguistics blog in 1998

1081
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,320
speculated, I deduce that for some reason, the Old Indo-Europeans were more respectful

1082
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,360
of the bear than the wolf, though they didn't diss the wolf either.

1083
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:28,480
This one was a little tricky to track down, since googling the term only returns

1084
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,800
results related to Shrek. I couldn't figure out why this was happening until I realized

1085
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:37,920
that the first word is an anagram of Shrek, and this green fella is so entrenched in culture

1086
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,080
that even anagrams of his name summon him. It actually seems to be in reference to

1087
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,560
another piece of reconstructed proto-Indo-European. It's gone through a few iterations over the

1088
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,560
years, as our understanding of PIE has improved. This is what it looks like.

1089
01:08:53,520 --> 01:09:01,120
This is an Italian song from 1972, with lyrics that are completely gibberish.

1090
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,120
It was written to sound like American English, from the perspective of someone who doesn't

1091
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,360
speak the language. Listening to it as an English speaker feels like you're having a stroke,

1092
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,920
because it really does sound like English, but the only decipherable words are alright.

1093
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:24,560
The songwriter, Adriano Salantano, talked about his goals with the song in an interview with NPR.

1094
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,440
The dialogue is interpreted by a translator. Ever since I started singing, I was very influenced

1095
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:34,960
by American music, and everything Americans did, so at a certain point, since I like American slang,

1096
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,280
which, for a singer, is much easier to sing than to sing in Italian, I thought that I would write

1097
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:44,080
a song which would only have, as its theme, the inability to communicate. And to do this,

1098
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,560
I had to write a song where the lyrics didn't mean anything. So to make a comparison, it's like

1099
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,200
what happened at the Tower of Babel. Everyone wanted to go towards the sky, and they were punished,

1100
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,960
because God confused all the languages, and no one understood each other anymore.

1101
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,520
This is the reason why I wrote the song. This song also went on to become a major hit all over

1102
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:07,120
Europe, topping the charts in Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg. But, as expected,

1103
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,800
it wasn't a major hit in America.

1104
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:18,000
Edward Sapir, one half of Sapir Worf, had a theory about the best way to figure out where a

1105
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,760
language originated. His method was simple. Find the area where that language has the most diversity.

1106
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,240
If one region has tons of different accents and dialects that vary considerably,

1107
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:32,560
it's safe to assume that the language probably originated there, rather than somewhere with

1108
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,960
a more homogenous speaking population, which is presumably the result of migration.

1109
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,560
As an example, let's go back to the Spanish lisp I talked about earlier.

1110
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,200
Some areas in northern Spain had the lisp, whereas speakers in the south didn't tend to have it.

1111
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:50,240
When the southern Spanish people migrated to Latin America, they brought over their lack of lisp,

1112
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:55,040
and now that speaking population is a lot more homogenous. If all the data you have is the higher

1113
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,760
level of diversity in Spain compared to America, the migration theory would correctly tell you

1114
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:05,040
that the language originated in that area. This theory isn't 100% guaranteed to work, though.

1115
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,240
Imagine a situation where linguistic diversity is completely wiped out by other people migrating

1116
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:15,280
in. So even if the language originated there, it might end up having less diversity than other regions.

1117
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,280
The Russian language actually has two separate terms for blue,

1118
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:28,720
Goluboy for light blue, and Ciny for dark blue. This isn't the same as the niche terms we have

1119
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:34,800
in English, like cyan blue or navy blue. They're actually basic color terms like green or purple.

1120
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,600
This scenario was pretty exciting for scientists, because it provided a perfect opportunity to test

1121
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,480
out the superior warf hypothesis. They asked Russian speakers to indicate whether two shades of blue

1122
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:49,440
were different or the same, as fast as they could. It turns out that they were much faster when they

1123
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,720
were presented with Goluboy and Ciny, rather than two shades of Goluboy or two shades of Ciny,

1124
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,280
whereas English speakers didn't demonstrate the same advantage as the Russians in telling these

1125
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:04,880
shades apart. Then they added a twist. They wanted to see if this effect was happening specifically

1126
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,880
because of their language speeding up their perception. They asked the participants to

1127
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,760
perform a verbal task at the same time, with the idea that it would make it harder to use language

1128
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,880
to help with their perception speed. And they were right. This completely eliminated the reaction

1129
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,840
time advantage that the Russian speakers had. Then they also had them do a spatial task as well,

1130
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:29,120
to make sure that language was really the factor at play, and the reaction time advantage remained.

1131
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,520
So all of this is pretty good evidence for the weak version of the superior warf hypothesis.

1132
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,080
The structure of language seems to be directly affecting the way we perceive and interact with

1133
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:47,920
the world. The ancient Roman god of the skies, Jupiter, also the name of this planet, was originally

1134
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:53,360
pronounced something like Jupiter. This word can be traced all the way back to the Proto-Indo-European

1135
01:12:53,920 --> 01:13:00,560
deuspiter, or skyfather. Funnily enough, the analogous Greek god Zeus also comes from the deus

1136
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:05,600
part of this. The original Proto-Indo-European sky daddy was a major figure in the ancient

1137
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:11,680
mythology of PIE culture, and was associated with daylight, the sky, and was all seeing. So

1138
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:17,440
divinity being associated with the sky or the day, as well as being male and paternal, is a very,

1139
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:22,800
very old idea. But the conception of this god is the number one guy, like Zeus or Jupiter,

1140
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,120
along with its association with storms and lightning, seems to be exclusive to the later

1141
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:36,400
conceptions in Mediterranean areas. If you've ever seen the movie Good Will Hunting, you've probably

1142
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:47,040
noticed that people from Boston often don't pronounce their Rs. The same is true in some

1143
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:51,840
areas of England, where most speakers in the south don't pronounce the R in words like park,

1144
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:58,160
but speakers in the north and west do. In 1966, the linguist William LeBov looked into this,

1145
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:03,680
specifically in which cases the R is pronounced, before pauses or consonants. He did a bit of

1146
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:07,840
unconventional science to test this out. He went to a bunch of different department stores in New

1147
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:13,200
York City, each notoriously frequented by different social classes of people. He went up to random

1148
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:18,240
people and asked them, hey there, where are the women's shoes? Or what floor is this? Expecting

1149
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:23,040
the answer, fourth floor. It turned out that staff at the higher end stores were more likely

1150
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:28,320
to pronounce the R, fourth floor, whereas staff at the lower end stores were more likely to leave it

1151
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:46,080
out, fourth floor. In 1942, a Norwegian woman, Astrid, presenting to the emergency room with

1152
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:51,520
a strange condition, she had spontaneously acquired a foreign accent that made her sound German or

1153
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,880
French. Two years previously, she had been hit with shrapnel during a raid in World War II,

1154
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,920
which was the likely cause of her neural problems. Unfortunately, this accent didn't give her the

1155
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:07,200
best reputation, since the Nazis were occupying Norway and her German sounding voice made people

1156
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:12,320
think she was a spy. Astrid's story is an example of foreign accent syndrome, and there have been

1157
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:17,440
over 100 other case studies about it. In 2013, there was an instance of this that went viral.

1158
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:22,480
An Australian woman, Leanne Rowe, started sounding French after she was in a car accident.

1159
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:28,400
It makes me so angry because I am Australian. I am not French.

1160
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,720
The cognitive scientist Lindsay Nichols argued that this was the result of changes in the

1161
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:38,480
pronunciation of vowels. The brain damage affected the way her jaw, lips, and tongue were situated.

1162
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,200
When someone is speaking in a non-native language, they often have to make changes in the ways their

1163
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:48,320
mouth muscles move and are situated, and the accident in this case resulted in that same kind

1164
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,920
of adjustment. So this woman didn't spontaneously develop a French accent, but instead the accent's

1165
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:59,200
effect on language production resulted in a way of speaking that reminded people of a French accent.

1166
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:08,880
Okay, so what's the deal with okay? The word is actually a lot newer than you might expect.

1167
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,800
The first known use of okay comes from a joke article in the Boston Morning Post from 1839,

1168
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:20,080
where okay was an abbreviation of all correct. The context for this was that it was oddly

1169
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:25,760
fashionable in the early 19th century to deliberately misspell things and use them as acronyms.

1170
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:33,520
No go becomes no go with a k or kg. All right becomes all right or ow, and all correct becomes

1171
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:39,440
all correct or okay. For a long time, people speculated about the linguistic origin of okay,

1172
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:45,120
suggesting Latin, Greek, Scottish, French, or other origins. One idea is that it came from the

1173
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,720
Choctaw word okay, which Andrew Jackson supposedly started using after hanging out with members of

1174
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:56,720
a Choctaw tribe. Even Woodrow Wilson believed this and often wrote okay with an e and an h on

1175
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:01,360
official papers because he claimed that okay was incorrect. This seems to be a myth though,

1176
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,920
and I also couldn't find any translations of okay in online Choctaw dictionaries.

1177
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,440
Generative grammar is the approach to language that looks at how it's structured. You've got all

1178
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:29,680
the different sounds we use, phonology, how individual words work, morphology, how sentences

1179
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:35,120
and phrases are built, syntax, and what the sentence actually means, semantics. Generative

1180
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,680
grammar is also often associated with the idea that human language is structured around a

1181
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:44,560
deeper pattern in our mind that determines how language is formed. The strongest version of

1182
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,360
this theory is Noam Chomsky's universal grammar, which is the idea that everyone is born with this

1183
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,800
basic language faculty in our mind. There are limits on what types of grammar are possible for a human

1184
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,520
language, since all language structure is based on this deeper faculty, so they all must share

1185
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,560
certain properties. For example, no matter what language you grow up speaking, your brain already

1186
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,200
knows general patterns about how things like nouns and verbs are supposed to work. You just need to

1187
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:14,080
learn the specific meaning of the nouns and verbs in your native language. Some stuff still varies,

1188
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,720
like whether adjectives come before or after nouns, which you still have to learn, but the basic

1189
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:23,120
structure is already present. There are a number of different arguments for and against universal

1190
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:27,600
grammar, but I'll be talking a bit more about this later. Cocoa Gorilla.

1191
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:34,240
Cocoa the Gorilla might be the most famous gorilla in the world, second only to Harambe.

1192
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:39,600
She met the likes of Robin Williams, Leonardo DiCaprio, Sting, Flea, and William Shatner.

1193
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:45,680
In 1972, the San Francisco Zoo started to teach Cocoa sign language when she was only one year old,

1194
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:50,000
and after two years she was moved to Stanford, where they started to rigorously train her for

1195
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,840
eight and a half hours a day. In 1979, they published a study about Cocoa in the journal Word,

1196
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,880
and it was peer reviewed. The results were staggering. Cocoa was able to use complex sign

1197
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,840
combinations, which indicated sophisticated cognition. She was also supposedly able to sign

1198
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,720
about objects that weren't currently present in her surroundings, a type of language use called

1199
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:16,880
displacement. She also signed good sign to another gorilla learning sign language, which is an example

1200
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,560
of meta language, using language to speak about language itself. Also, they claimed that she often

1201
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,760
used language deceptively, intentionally signing statements that she knew to be false, basically

1202
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:33,040
lying. Unfortunately though, the study has been widely criticized. Most researchers agree that

1203
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:37,520
Cocoa never actually understood the meaning of the signs she used, and she was basically just

1204
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,720
making gestures in order to get food. So it was all just complicated operant conditioning,

1205
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:47,520
rather than full-on language learning. And beyond that, a lot of critics pointed out that all of

1206
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,160
Cocoa's signing was interpreted by the handler, who may have been attributing meaningful sign

1207
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:57,200
combinations to completely meaningless gestures in order to make it look like the Cocoa project

1208
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:02,160
was successful. This whole Cocoa scenario is reminiscent of the Clever Hands case. In the

1209
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:07,440
early 20th century, the horse known as Clever Hands was taken from town to town, and his owner

1210
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:12,480
showed people how Hands could do math, adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and loads

1211
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,200
of other fancy tasks. Hands would answer every question by tapping his hoof a bunch of times.

1212
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:22,160
But in reality, Hands couldn't actually do any of this. It turns out, Hands was actually just

1213
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:27,120
responding to very subtle body language cues from the trainer, and the trainer didn't even realize

1214
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,080
that they were doing them.

1215
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:37,120
Sometime in the 1960s, in the Atherton Table and Rainforests in Australia,

1216
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:42,240
the linguist Robert M.W. Dixon was studying the aboriginal languages of Australia,

1217
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,320
and discovered something really strange. He came across this guy Albert Bennett,

1218
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,840
who spoke Mabobarum, a now extinct language, and started asking him to translate basic words.

1219
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,520
One of the first words he asked was dog, and Bennett replied,

1220
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,600
dog. Dixon was confused and thought that Bennett didn't understand the question,

1221
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,600
or maybe he didn't know how to actually speak this language at all. But surprisingly,

1222
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:09,440
the Mabobarum word for dog was actually dog, and was pronounced in almost the exact same way.

1223
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:14,480
Now you might look at this story and think that Mabobarum in English must be related in some way,

1224
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,600
but there's no historical evidence for this. It's entirely a coincidence, and a pretty weird one too.

1225
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:26,640
Out of all the writing systems currently used in the world,

1226
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,160
Chinese characters are the oldest, and compared to Latin script,

1227
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,600
it seems really complicated. Out of all the characters, though,

1228
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,360
one of them is thought to be the single most complicated character to write.

1229
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,080
The traditional character for Biang takes 58 different strokes to write. If you're less

1230
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,920
efficient with your writing, it might even take you more strokes to write it. But hey,

1231
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:52,480
different strokes for different folks. The word itself refers to a type of noodle.

1232
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:57,520
The origin of the character is also a mystery. An article in China Daily claims that it's an

1233
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:03,120
automatapia that comes from the sound it makes when the chef bangs the dough into noodles on the table.

1234
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,520
There's also an urban legend about a student who wrote down the Biang character on his bill

1235
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,040
at a noodle restaurant to get out of paying, and he had totally made it up.

1236
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:18,560
A lot of the constructed languages I've talked about here, like Esperanto,

1237
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,280
create a lot of their vocabulary and grammar based on other languages that already exist.

1238
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:28,160
But this language is different. Sol Rosol is based on music. In 1827,

1239
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:33,200
the violinist and music teacher François Sudre built Sol Rosol out of the familiar

1240
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:38,960
Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do syllables. The words are built by combining these syllables together,

1241
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:43,440
but since there were so few of them, things could get really complicated really fast,

1242
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,480
so Sudre decided to cap it to five syllable words. If you have good pitch, you can even

1243
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,640
sing the language based on the notes of each syllable, but you could also just speak it normally.

1244
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:58,000
In France, Sudre brought his work to the public, and the press covered it extensively. Even Victor

1245
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,640
Hugo seemed to think it was a really cool project. He had spent over three decades working on this

1246
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:07,680
language, but after he died it faded into obscurity. It's had a bit of a resurgence recently though,

1247
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:10,720
with the internet and the rise of the constructed language community.

1248
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,840
In 1819, near the Singapore River, some laborers going through the jungle found a

1249
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,880
large slab of sandstone with some inscriptions on the side. The writing is in Kawi script,

1250
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,280
and it also has some Sanskrit words in there. By the time it was found, the people who lived

1251
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:34,400
on the island couldn't understand what it said, and to this day, linguists still haven't fully

1252
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:39,600
deciphered it. The stone is believed to be from the 10th to the 14th century. The stone itself

1253
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,200
in its physical location also seemed to be related to a Malay legend, the strongman Badang.

1254
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:49,760
The story goes that he was a slave working to clear a forest. While fishing in the Singapore

1255
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:55,920
River, he managed to catch a genie who agreed to grant him one wish. Badang asked to be the strongest

1256
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,240
man of all time, since he figured that that would help him be a better slave, since he could clear

1257
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:05,440
the trees faster. Not a bad wish by any means, but given his circumstances, I could definitely think

1258
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:11,280
of a better one. In any case, he became very strong and was able to uproot trees effortlessly.

1259
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:15,360
Over time, his feats of strength caught the attention of the king, who ended up appointing

1260
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:20,480
him the commander of the army. The king of India also reached out and sent a strongman of his own

1261
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:26,080
to the Malay archipelago to compete in a competition to see who was stronger. The competition involved

1262
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:31,040
lifting a large rock. The other strongman was able to hoist it up before letting it fall,

1263
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:36,640
but Badang picked it up no problem and threw it towards the Singapore River. As the legend goes,

1264
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:41,680
this was the Singapore Stone. Now let's return to more modern times. A few decades after the

1265
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:46,720
stone turned up, the British colonized the area and ended up blowing up the Singapore Stone to

1266
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,800
make room for a fort they wanted to build. Now only a small fragment remains.

1267
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:59,280
Here's another artifact for you. In 1639, a golden horn

1268
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:05,680
turned up in Denmark with some rune inscriptions on it. And then, about 100 years passed. In 1734,

1269
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:10,400
they found a very similar golden horn. It was about 15 meters away from the first one,

1270
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:14,960
but it took them 100 years to find it. The horns were created around 400 AD,

1271
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,360
and the runic inscriptions look something like this. It translates from Norse to

1272
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:24,320
I, his name, made the horn. This is one of the earliest examples of a full sentence in these

1273
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:29,920
kinds of runes, and it's also the earliest preserved line of alliteration with the three H's.

1274
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:35,760
In 1802, the horns were stolen by some goldsmith guy who broke into the storage area with forged

1275
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,720
keys and melted them down for gold to sell. Fortunately, people had made drawings of them,

1276
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:46,640
so replicas were made. That didn't stop the thieves though. About 200 years later, in 1993,

1277
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:51,680
the copies were stolen, and then promptly thrown away into a nearby forest and recovered by

1278
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:56,640
authorities. And then again in 2007, silver copies were stolen from a different museum,

1279
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:00,720
but recovered again a few days later. It seems the lesson here is that reverence for

1280
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:04,400
ancient artifacts can always be thwarted by coveting precious metals.

1281
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,280
Imagine you had such contempt for the French that you spoke a version of English with

1282
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:18,880
none of the vocabulary that was borrowed from French. That's English. In 1966, the term was

1283
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:24,480
coined by Paul Jennings in the British satirical magazine Punch as part of a series on the 900th

1284
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:29,760
anniversary of the Norman conquest of England. English is, the language we should have had

1285
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,560
if the Normans had been defeated at Hastings. That's an agensé from one of the articles.

1286
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,920
Oh sorry, agensé is anglish for quote. That's just one like thing of how we have to shift

1287
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,200
certain common words to miss using anything from the French. Speaking English is pretty hard,

1288
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,920
since a pretty huge chunk of English words don't come from Germanic. It turns out that

1289
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:55,520
English is actually part of a pretty long-standing attitude of linguistic purism. Even some famous

1290
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:00,880
writers had this attitude, and tried to avoid using foreign words in English prose. Charles

1291
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:06,640
Dickens would sometimes use a kind of English, using gleamon instead of musician, sicker instead

1292
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:12,640
of certainly, or ensé for conclusion. In politics in the English language, George Orwell also

1293
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:17,200
criticized the usage of borrowed words, and seemed to think that they were too pretentious.

1294
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,920
Bad writers, and especially scientific, political, and sociological writers,

1295
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:27,600
are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones,

1296
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:34,960
and unnecessary words like expedite, ameliorate, predict, extraneous, deracinated, clandestine,

1297
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:41,120
subacquious, and hundreds of others constantly gain ground from their Anglo-Saxon opposite numbers.

1298
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:46,160
Winston Churchill's speech writing technique also involved using primarily Germanic words,

1299
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:51,280
with as few syllables as possible, to make his speeches punchier and easier to understand.

1300
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,760
This whole attitude can be traced back to the famous Inkhorn controversy in England

1301
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:01,440
during the 16th and 17th centuries. At the time, tons of words from Latin and French were starting

1302
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:06,320
to get used, mostly by academics. Some people thought that this was great, and English was

1303
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,640
being revitalized with all these new words to express new things. But other people thought

1304
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:16,000
that it was just pretentious garbage. One of the main purists was Sir John Check, who wrote,

1305
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,680
I am of the opinion that our tongue should be written clean and pure,

1306
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:24,640
unmixed and unmangled with borrowing of other tongues. But eventually this debate slowly came

1307
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:30,240
to an end. We kept a lot of terms, like impede, but not others, like exped, which we now use in

1308
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:35,920
expedient and expedite. All of this was basically just a development of English during the Renaissance

1309
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,920
that was a little more fast paced than usual. There's nothing anybody can do to slow down

1310
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,040
the evolution of language, no matter how much they hate the French.

1311
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:51,600
It makes sense why the words we use for our parents in English is pretty similar to

1312
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:57,920
Mama and Papa in French, Mama and Babo in Italian, and Mama and Papa in Norwegian,

1313
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,480
since all of these languages trace back to Proto-Indo-European. But other languages also

1314
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:08,400
have similar sounding words too. Swahili has Mama and Baba, Tagalog in the Philippines has Nene

1315
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:14,560
and Tate, and even Mandarin has Mama and Baba. So what's going on here? How do all these completely

1316
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:20,640
disconnected languages all have such similar words for our moms and dads? It actually has to do with

1317
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:26,560
how babies start to learn to talk. The early linguist Roman Jacobson figured out that if you're a baby

1318
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:31,760
and randomly babbling, the easiest vowel to make is ah, because you don't have to put your tongue

1319
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:36,480
or lips in any particular shape, you just open your mouth and make noise. And naturally, if you're

1320
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:42,160
going to switch things up, the first thing you'll try to do is close the lips, leading to an mmm sound.

1321
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:48,000
Together, that forms Mama. The next step, once you get a bit more creative with your baby mouth,

1322
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,240
is to put your lips together and blow out a puff of air, leading to a sound like p or b. So naturally,

1323
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:58,720
since you spend most of the time as a baby with your mom, Mama is attributed to the mother,

1324
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:03,280
and Papa, the more sophisticated version that you learn later, is attributed to your dad.

1325
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:12,880
Glossalalia is also known as speaking in tongues, which itself is also known as a great album by

1326
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:18,320
the Talking Heads. It basically involves uttering utter gibberish that sounds like real speech,

1327
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:23,520
but doesn't mean anything. It's been used as a religious practice, notably in Pentecostalism,

1328
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:34,560
to achieve a direct experience with God. This tongue speaking was widely analyzed

1329
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:40,560
by the U of T linguist William Samarin in 1972. It turns out that this kind of speech is pretty

1330
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:46,160
similar to human language. It has an accent, a rhythm, an intonation, and even pauses to break

1331
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:51,760
up speech into individual words. The sounds the speaker uses also tend to be the sounds found

1332
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:56,720
in their native language. But despite all those similarities, none of this makes glossalalia

1333
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,560
a full-on language, since there's no structure to what any of the sounds mean.

1334
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:03,040
Doord

1335
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:10,640
Doord, noun, physics and chemistry, abbreviation for density. This definition was included in

1336
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:16,880
the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 1934. But doord isn't actually a real word. The story of how this

1337
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:21,440
happened is also kind of funny. The chemistry editor for the dictionary had sent in a slip of

1338
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:28,240
paper to include an abbreviation for density. It looked like this, D or D, Kant, density.

1339
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:33,040
The intended meaning here was that the letter D, capitalized or uncapitalized, could be an

1340
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:39,840
abbreviation for density. But the person submitting definitions read D or D as a full word, doord.

1341
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,640
And this wasn't caught by proofreaders. Five years after it was published, an editor noticed

1342
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:49,440
that this word didn't have any etymology and realized it was a mistake. So it was taken out.

1343
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,440
Doord

1344
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:58,800
It's cool.

1345
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:05,520
Natural languages are adequate, but that doesn't mean they're optimal. That's what John Kajada

1346
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,720
told The New Yorker in an article about the language he constructed. In 2004, he set up a

1347
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:16,320
web page titled Itquil, a philosophical design for a hypothetical language. And I have to say,

1348
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:23,280
it's pretty cool. This web page was huge, though. It was nearly 160,000 words describing the grammar,

1349
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:28,480
vocabulary, and structure of the language. The goal of the language was pretty similar to Loglan,

1350
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:33,840
to create a perfect language that lent itself to logical thinking, emphasized brevity and expressing

1351
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,560
thoughts, and avoiding ambiguity as much as possible. The logical part is cool enough,

1352
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:44,880
but the way it's able to collapse long ideas into bite-sized pieces is astonishing. This sentence,

1353
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,400
on the contrary, I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point,

1354
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:56,080
turns into this. And the phrase, characteristic of a single component among the synergistic

1355
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:02,080
amalgamation of things, is a single adjective, this. The language started to blow up when a Russian

1356
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,960
magazine Computera wrote an article about it and talked about the language's similarities to a

1357
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:13,200
fictional language in the sci-fi novella Gulf, written by Robert Heinlein in 1949. The novella

1358
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:18,480
involves this highly advanced society, who speak a language called speed talk, which condenses

1359
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:23,920
entire sentences into single words. This allows them to communicate more efficiently, and eventually

1360
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:29,440
conquer the world. This type of language is also reminiscent of Chinese. When Westerners were first

1361
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:35,120
exposed to it, they were really excited about the idea that each character signified a full concept,

1362
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:40,000
rather than just a sound. After the philosopher Leibniz heard about this, he speculated about a

1363
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,200
kind of futuristic language that followed this type of system, with universal characters representing

1364
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:49,760
concepts in the same way that Arabic numerals represent quantities. He wrote,

1365
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:55,280
this writing would be a kind of general algebra and calculus of reason, so that instead of disputing,

1366
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:01,600
we can say that we calculate. In 2008, Ithquil was given the Smiley Award for the best invented

1367
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,240
language of the year by David Peterson, the president of the Language Creation Society,

1368
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:10,320
and the inventor of Dothraki, the fictional language used in Game of Thrones.

1369
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:15,120
But the thing with Ithquil is that it was never actually meant to be spoken. The word Ithquil

1370
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:20,080
means hypothetical representation of a language. John was trying to create something that could

1371
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:24,800
show what language could be, conveying deeper levels of meaning as efficiently as possible.

1372
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:29,760
So given that, there aren't really any active speakers of Ithquil. One linguist wrote that it

1373
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,160
has an assumption of efficiency that isn't really efficient, given how the brain works.

1374
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:38,480
It misses the metaphor stuff, but the parts that are successful are really non-trivial.

1375
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:42,880
This may be an impossible language, but if you think of it as a conceptual art project,

1376
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,920
I think it's fascinating.

1377
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:53,520
Sometime in the early 17th century, at an island near Iceland, a group of Basque

1378
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:58,160
speakers from an area near Spain and France were hanging out to do some whaling, and they

1379
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:02,800
made contact with some of the Icelandic fishermen. They interacted with them for a while and

1380
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:07,520
eventually a pigeon formed, combining aspects of each of their languages. Most of the phrases

1381
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:13,200
they used, as you might expect, related to whaling and fishing. Like, if Christ and Mary would give

1382
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:18,160
me a whale, I would give you the tail. Along with more everyday expressions, like this,

1383
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:22,960
which would translate into, I will give you sponge cake and cider. You might be wondering why

1384
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:27,680
Basque people had traveled so far to go whaling. It turns out that they had actually been whaling

1385
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:31,760
since the Middle Ages, and were one of the first groups of people to do it for profit.

1386
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:36,560
But as time went on, other cultures started hunting whales, and took up most of their territory.

1387
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:41,760
So the Basques spread out to places like Newfoundland and Iceland, where there was less competition.

1388
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:46,320
The situation was pretty good for both parties for a while. The Icelandic people didn't really

1389
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,320
actively hunt whales, and mostly just took the meat and bones from whales who had already

1390
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:54,960
washed up on the beach. So the Basques came in, provided fresher meat that they had hunted,

1391
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:01,680
and even paid taxes. But this didn't last too long. In 1615, a group of Basque whalers got shipwrecked,

1392
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:06,640
and stranded on the coast for a full winter. They ran out of food, and resorted to stealing

1393
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:11,280
from the Icelandic people to survive. But the Icelandics didn't take too well to this,

1394
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:16,320
so the Basques were massacred. Iceland even had a law that made it totally legal to kill

1395
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,920
Basques on site, and that law was only repealed in 2015.

1396
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:29,360
The etymology of butterfly isn't fully known. One suggestion is that it comes from the buttery

1397
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:34,560
yellow color of the common sulfur butterfly. Another idea comes from the old German name

1398
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:40,160
Butterlicker, Butterlicker, and Milk Dieb, Milk Thief, since people in the middle ages might have

1399
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:45,040
believed that butterflies went around stealing milk and butter. And here's the funny one.

1400
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:51,040
Old Dutch has the term bottersheet, or buttershit. This is in reference to the bright yellow poop

1401
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:55,200
called meconium that butterflies produce after they undergo metamorphosis.

1402
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:05,360
A copy of the book of Psalms from 1429, written in Cyrillic script, contained this phrase,

1403
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:10,240
many-eyed seraphim. The character of interest here is this one, that looks like a bunch of eyes,

1404
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:14,720
and might be triggering your trypophobia. Funnily enough, this obscure character is

1405
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:20,480
actually included in Unicode. This was done in 2007, when a group of Slavic medieval scholars

1406
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:25,040
pushed to have a bunch of Cyrillic characters added. This character was only one of a few

1407
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:30,640
different variations of the ocular O, which were all included at once. Even though this specific

1408
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:35,200
character only ever appeared once, it was part of this larger group of characters that were fairly

1409
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:43,360
common, so they figured they'd throw this one in too. If you visit the Paramalana village in

1410
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:58,800
Greece, you'll hear people speaking a rare type of Greek, called syconica. It's a 3,000-year-old

1411
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:04,000
language, and descends from the Greek city-state of Sparta. These days, it's very rare to find

1412
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,280
people speaking it, even among syconians, only about 2,000 people speak it, most of whom also

1413
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:14,160
speak Greek, since that's the official language of the region. It has a pretty similar alphabet to

1414
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:18,880
modern or ancient Greek, but it uses a lot more phonetic letters, and has a fairly different

1415
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:23,840
structure and pronunciation. It's different enough that modern Greek speakers wouldn't be able to

1416
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:28,560
understand it at all. Because of how few people speak this language, and the fact that most of

1417
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:32,800
them are pretty old, syconian is classified as a critically endangered language.

1418
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:41,520
The proto-world, or the proto-human language, is the idea that every single language in the

1419
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:47,280
world descended from one single original language. The basic argument is that all humans around

1420
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:52,960
the world have the capacity to learn any language. Presumably, earlier humans had this ability too,

1421
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:58,560
so languages today must trace back to some period of time where only one language was spoken,

1422
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:03,120
and spread out and diversified over time. This isn't entirely clear cut though,

1423
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:06,960
since it is possible that ancient humans had the capacity to use language,

1424
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:12,640
but language still hadn't developed yet, so the linguistic ability came before language development.

1425
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:17,280
Or maybe language started and stopped a bunch of different times throughout human history,

1426
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:22,240
meaning that it could start fresh independently in two different isolated human communities.

1427
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:27,680
In this case, there could be proto-language 1, proto-language 2, proto-language 3, and so on.

1428
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,920
We don't know for sure though, and there's no direct evidence for either of these options.

1429
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,160
Some linguists have even gone as far as to speculate what this proto-language might have

1430
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:41,040
sounded like by comparing loads of different languages around the world. If only we had invented

1431
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:45,600
writing tens of thousands of years earlier than we did, then maybe we'd actually know for sure.

1432
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:55,760
In 1900, some clay tablets turned up in Crete, and nobody could figure out what they said.

1433
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:01,920
It came to be known as Linear B, and remained a mystery until 1952, when the British architect

1434
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,280
and amateur linguist Michael Ventress finally cracked it. Naturally, he got all the credit,

1435
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:11,760
but as with a lot of scientific achievements, there was a woman behind it all who got little to

1436
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:17,440
no credit. She was a classist from the US, Alice Kober, and before Michael ever took a shot at

1437
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,720
cracking Linear B, she was busy working hard on it making progress. It was she who was working

1438
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:27,760
hundreds of hours with a slide rule, sitting at her dinner table, a cigarette burning at her elbow,

1439
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:32,400
pouring over the few published inscriptions, looking and looking for patterns. Rather than

1440
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:37,760
trying to make any wild speculations, she meticulously recorded the frequency of every symbol and their

1441
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:43,440
position in words. This was long before computers, so she stored all the information on index cards

1442
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:48,720
made of scrap paper that she held in cigarette cartons. Ventress started to build on this work too,

1443
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:52,880
and they even met each other at one point in Oxford. They didn't exactly hit it off though.

1444
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:57,520
It seemed like she underestimated him because he wasn't an academically trained linguist,

1445
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:03,280
and he underestimated her because she was a woman. Kober was on the precipice of a huge discovery,

1446
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,600
and started to notice patterns with the way that groups of symbols started and ended.

1447
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:13,120
But right before the major breakthrough happened, she fell ill and died suddenly in 1950.

1448
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:17,920
Ventress picked up where she left off and eventually cracked Linear B. Unsurprisingly,

1449
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,880
it turned out to be an old form of ancient Greek. Ventress did mention Kober's contributions

1450
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:26,640
thoroughly in talks and stuff though, and fully acknowledged her contributions,

1451
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:31,120
so she got some credit too. Except at the time nobody actually cared, and he ended up getting

1452
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:36,640
all the credit for himself. Linear B as a term also raises the question, what about Linear A?

1453
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:41,520
It turns out there is a slab of script that was found in the same area. A lot less of it survived

1454
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:44,160
though, and as of today, it hasn't been deciphered.

1455
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:51,920
This is something I've touched on a bit already, when I was talking about generative grammar.

1456
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:56,240
This is the idea that language is pre-programmed into our brains when we're born.

1457
01:41:56,240 --> 01:42:01,600
We don't pop out of our mothers, speaking English or Mandarin, but we do pop out with some vague,

1458
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:06,960
pre-existing understanding of how language generally works. Before this, people like B.F.

1459
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:12,320
Skinner, the rat-button guy, put forward the idea that language learning is basically just a process

1460
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:18,240
of conditioning and reinforcement. We watch someone point to a dog, and say dog, and then later,

1461
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:23,280
we point to a dog and say dog, and someone tells us, good job, that is a dog. Nice.

1462
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:28,240
This was all tied to his general psychological theory of behaviorism, that saw the human mind

1463
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:34,720
as a basic input-output system. Later on, Noam Chomsky brutally annihilated Skinner's arguments.

1464
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:38,080
He pointed out that when you actually look at how children learn language,

1465
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:41,840
they don't learn from people telling them that they used the right word or grammar.

1466
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:45,680
They learn by watching TV or listening to other people talk around them.

1467
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:49,280
Children can also construct sentences that they've never heard before.

1468
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:54,560
The way language is used is a lot more complicated than, you used the right sentence there. Nice.

1469
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,600
Or, you didn't use the right sentence there. What are you doing?

1470
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:02,960
It seems unlikely that language learning is similar to a rat learning to press a button to get food.

1471
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:07,840
This new idea from Chomsky was pretty huge at the time, since the dominant view was that basically

1472
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,480
all forms of learning were reinforcement-based. Psychologists couldn't continue to look at

1473
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:17,600
the mind as a black box, only focusing on input and output. They had to try to understand what

1474
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:22,080
was actually going on inside the black box. Another interesting piece of evidence for

1475
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:26,400
innateness came up more recently. You might remember earlier when I talked about pigeons,

1476
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:30,560
hodgepodge languages, built out of combinations of two existing languages,

1477
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,840
to allow two communities to communicate, and how they can transform into creoles over time

1478
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,720
when children learn those pigeons as their native language. Stephen Pinker has argued that this

1479
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:46,400
creolization is only possible because the innate language structures these children have allows

1480
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:51,680
them to add complexity to the pigeons and slowly develop them into fully-fledged languages.

1481
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:55,440
This isn't just the kids learning how to communicate with people using their pigeons,

1482
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:00,160
but it's them taking that pigeon and applying the linguistic universals they're born with.

1483
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,760
It's important to mention that language innateness has been criticized as well.

1484
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:08,240
Some have argued that the fact that languages all have similar structures is perfectly normal,

1485
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:11,920
and we shouldn't have to appeal to an underlying mental structure to account for it.

1486
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:20,480
There are two things I think this entry might be referring to. The first is a theory about how

1487
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,880
English came about. When you look at Old English and Middle English, they're really different.

1488
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:28,880
It could be that all the French influence that followed the norm and conquest of England

1489
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:33,280
resulted in a creolization process that smushed together the two languages,

1490
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:37,680
which eventually developed into modern English. But some scholars have also argued that this

1491
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:42,320
smushing together was a lot less comprehensive than originally thought, and it was basically just

1492
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:47,440
some borrowing of words rather than a full-on adjustment of morphology and syntax, and that

1493
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:51,760
the other Germanic languages experienced similar innovations around the same time.

1494
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:56,080
The other possible meaning of this entry is that the meme maker is doing a bit.

1495
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,840
The entry might be suggesting that English is a pigeon, and that it's the way people

1496
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:04,800
communicate with each other when they have no language in common. Antonio Gramsci talked about

1497
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:10,240
how language was always tied to the enlargement of the governing class, the relationships between

1498
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:15,360
the governing groups and the national popular mass, and the fight over cultural hegemony.

1499
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:20,880
If language is a war, it looks like English is winning, with about 1.5 billion speakers

1500
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,080
and accounting for 60% of internet content. Loads of modern words that come from English

1501
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:30,960
are co-opted by other languages, sometimes begrudgingly, like French people starting to refer

1502
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:37,040
to Le Wocchisme. In Europe, nearly every single student studies English at some point. In France,

1503
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:41,600
specifically, young students are required to study one of eight foreign languages,

1504
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:47,120
and 90% of them choose English. In Tunisia, employees who know how to speak fluent English

1505
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:53,520
earn 5% more, and in Iraq, they earn 200% more. When world leaders speak to each other, English

1506
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:58,480
is often the common language, even if neither of them speak it as their native tongue. So against

1507
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:04,960
all odds, English, with its wealth of exceptions, bizarre characteristics, and frankly weird sound,

1508
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,240
it has become the great equalizer in politics and culture.

1509
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:25,360
This is the ultimate Joe Rogan idea. It checks all the boxes, wild speculation, vaguely scientific

1510
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:30,640
sounding, psychedelics, and apes. It comes from Terrence McKenna, who was an outspoken advocate

1511
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:35,600
for responsible psychedelic use, and held lectures discussing mysticism, philosophy,

1512
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:40,160
and insights from the psychedelic experience. He was a pretty big deal in the 80s and 90s

1513
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:44,880
counterculture scene in California, and his lectures have blown up on YouTube after his death.

1514
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:50,320
One of his more bizarre ideas is the so-called stoned ape theory. He speculated that ancient

1515
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:55,520
humans who tracked cattle herds while hunting probably ended up ingesting magic mushrooms

1516
01:46:55,520 --> 01:47:00,240
that grow on cow dung. The reason they decided to eat the revolting stuff was because it would

1517
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:05,520
have improved visual acuity to help with hunting. In larger doses, it would increase energy

1518
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,760
and help with social bonding, and all this stuff would have been evolutionarily useful.

1519
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:14,080
The trips they experienced on these drugs also might have accelerated their cultural evolution,

1520
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:19,280
giving rise to early forms of religion and spirituality, the arts, and most importantly,

1521
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:24,320
language. Generally, this idea isn't widely accepted, but there are parts of it that might

1522
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:29,360
be plausible. It's totally conceivable that early humans consumed psychedelic drugs,

1523
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:33,440
and those experiences might have impacted their culture. But the strong version of the

1524
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:38,800
stoned ape theory goes as far as to say that this psychedelic use altered the actual genetics of

1525
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:43,440
the early humans and directly caused the beginning of language, which seems unlikely.

1526
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:47,920
I didn't find it persuasive, and in fact, if you press Terence McCanna, he didn't find it

1527
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:52,560
entirely persuasive. It's a very interesting speculation. It's kind of a mind game. I can see

1528
01:47:52,560 --> 01:48:01,920
how psychedelics would influence the mind and create new ideas, new memes, and might contribute

1529
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:08,160
to language. But how does it get into the genes? I see psychedelics as having had a profound effect

1530
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:14,800
at the level of cultural evolution, that there are lots of interesting innovations that people who

1531
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:23,760
had psychedelic experience introduced to our culture. A bizarre take on the whole proto-world

1532
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:29,120
original language question came from an unlikely place, Turkish ultra-nationalists.

1533
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:34,400
The Sun language is a pseudo-linguistic, pseudo-scientific pseudo-theory from Turkey

1534
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:39,920
around the mid-1930s that basically states that the first human language started in Turkey.

1535
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:45,280
The rationale has to do with the idea that all languages started out as hieroglyphics and script

1536
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:50,320
in the Sumerian civilization. The Turkish linguists believed that the Sumerian culture

1537
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:56,160
had Turkish origins, so therefore, Turkey was the cradle of language. The first president of Turkey

1538
01:48:56,160 --> 01:49:00,960
was a big supporter of this theory, and given his influence, was able to popularize the idea.

1539
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:05,360
This was politically convenient too, since it really aligned with the whole nationalist

1540
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:10,800
Turkey number one thing. As the story goes, primitive humans in Turkey were so struck by

1541
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:16,240
the effects of the Sun, they built a spirituality around a Sun deity. As they developed language,

1542
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:21,840
the first word they assigned was ag, for the Sun, and from there, the rest of language was built.

1543
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:27,200
Some linguists have suggested that this whole theory was basically just political cope. At the

1544
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:32,560
time, the Turkish language had a bunch of loanwords from Arabic and Persian that the authorities were

1545
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:36,960
trying to get rid of, but the public didn't seem to be adopting their new Turkish replacements.

1546
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:41,840
So if they just assumed that all languages ended up starting in Turkey, these loanwords could still

1547
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:47,040
be considered Turkish in a way, so they could still maintain this nationalist vibe without having to

1548
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:56,960
change the language. This one is pretty wacky. In the early 2000s, an amateur linguist posted a

1549
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:02,960
number of long, sprawling web pages with bizarre ramblings about his linguistic theories. The

1550
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:08,160
whole project was apparently a hobby he took up during retirement. He never studied linguistics

1551
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:14,560
or philology at all. In fact, he had a BA in forestry. He wrote, Now why would someone with

1552
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:20,960
formal training in forest and land administration, surveying, aerial photo interpretation, wildlife

1553
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:27,360
suppression, forest ecology, botany, etc., venture into fields as remote as linguistics,

1554
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:34,080
Homeric studies, Irish ogum inscription translation, pre-Christian religion, and archaeology?

1555
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:39,280
Because here was obviously a wide open and interesting field of study, which for centuries

1556
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:44,960
had attracted many non-academic outsiders who made great contributions to the science they chose

1557
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:50,880
to work on. So notably, he believed that the Basque language was the one and only original

1558
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:56,720
language, and the whole idea of how languages work according to other linguists is total bullshit.

1559
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:03,040
For him, every language besides Basque is fake, and was invented by the Benedictine monks. He

1560
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:07,920
suggested that people weren't buying the whole Tower of Babel story, since everyone around only

1561
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,960
spoke Basque. So the monks invented a bunch of other languages and spread them around the world,

1562
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:18,800
so that the myth made sense. It was in Babel that the Lord confused the language of all the earth,

1563
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:23,920
and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of the earth. Could all the Indo-European

1564
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:28,960
languages be the product of highly skilled religious linguists? It may be hard to believe,

1565
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:33,680
but that is exactly what happened. There have been a few forum threads of people laughing at this

1566
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:39,120
guy's crazy theories, and some of his made-up Basque etymologies. One person wrote,

1567
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:44,960
Nyland, a self-taught philologist, was just a crazy man, playing with esoteric concepts

1568
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:50,800
and absurd phonological correspondences. For instance, this etymology of doctor that traces

1569
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:55,840
back to Basque words that mean a bloody injury come quickly. I'd highly recommend spending

1570
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:00,160
some time scrolling through this guy's webpage, or some of the forum threads about him if you find

1571
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:09,680
this as funny as I do. One of the defining features of Italian culture is the widespread

1572
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:15,200
use of hand gestures alongside speech. The origin of the unique use of hand gestures in Italy

1573
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:19,680
is still an open question, but some scholars have speculated that it comes from the Romans,

1574
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:25,200
who used what's called Chironomia, a system of hand gestures to communicate. Here's some examples

1575
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:29,200
of some of the basic ones that you can add to your repertoire if you want a roleplay as the

1576
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:35,600
godfather or a fancy Italian chef. Pinched fingers pointing up means what or what do you mean?

1577
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:42,080
Prayer hands means please or could you do this for me? The okay hand is perfect. Kissing all

1578
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:47,360
your fingers and extending your arm away means delicious. Putting your index and middle finger

1579
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:52,080
in a V shape and bringing it to your mouth means to ask for a cigarette. And now this one you got

1580
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:57,280
to be careful with. Bend your arm in an L shape with your fist pointing up and slap your bicep

1581
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:04,480
as you raise your arm up. This means fuck you and is similar to giving the finger. Curse of 39.

1582
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:10,560
Humans love patterns. Patterns are great. Always need patterns. Can never have enough

1583
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:16,160
patterns. We always need to be making arbitrary associations between concepts. It's very important.

1584
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:22,160
One such association is in Afghanistan with the number 39. Evolution. Can you give me pattern

1585
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:28,560
seeking brain? To avoid predators? Yes. Actually develops arbitrary association between the number

1586
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:35,520
39, curse, shame, and prostitution. People caught with the 39 on their license plate are met with

1587
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:40,320
other drivers flashing their lights, honking their horns, and pointing at them. People have even

1588
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:45,120
started painting over their license plates to change the nine to an eight. Traffic commission

1589
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:51,680
workers are receiving bribes of upwards of $230 to issue different plates. And people trying to

1590
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:59,360
sell cars with a 39 plate have to discount it by $2,000. Selling an apartment with unit number 39

1591
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:04,960
is also pretty much impossible. It's unclear exactly why this association emerged, but it seems

1592
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:10,960
to be having very real consequences. One suggestion is that it comes from an infamous Afghan pimp who

1593
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:17,600
went by the name 39 since his car had a 39 plate and he lived in apartment number 39. But that

1594
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:23,280
story could be totally fake and it could just be flat out corruption. Police officials might have

1595
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:28,480
spread this myth so they can get bribes to have people's plate names changed. And car dealers

1596
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:34,080
might have been in on this too since they could buy 39 plate cars at a discount, change the plates,

1597
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:42,960
and then resell for a profit. Codex seraphineanus. I present you with this bizarre illustration

1598
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:50,240
of a procreating couple who slowly anamorph into a crocodile. This is from the Codex seraphineanus

1599
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:57,120
by Luigi Seraphini, which has been appreciated by literary giants like Umberto Eco, Roland Barth,

1600
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:03,520
and Italo Calvino. It basically consists of a bunch of general encyclopedic topics like flora

1601
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:09,600
and fauna, physics and chemistry, machines and gizmos, history, culture, and other things,

1602
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:15,920
but all in a super surreal style. Luigi started on this project in the 70s and as this insider

1603
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:22,400
article reads, was possibly under the influence of psychedelics or other worldly forces. Originally,

1604
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:27,360
Luigi wanted this book to be published completely anonymously because he was fascinated with the

1605
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:32,960
Voynick manuscript and its mysterious origins, but eventually he compromised and it was published

1606
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:38,880
under the name seraphineanus to give his own name a Latin sounding mystique. The relevant part of this

1607
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:44,000
bewildering work is that it's written in a completely imaginary language. The script looks

1608
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:49,840
familiar to western writing, being read and left to right rows, with uppercase and lowercase letters.

1609
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:55,840
In 2009, Luigi claimed that the writing in the Codex doesn't actually have any meaning at all,

1610
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:01,280
and his goal was to create that childlike sense you get when you look at text as a small child

1611
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:04,960
that you can't understand, but you assume that adults know what it means.

1612
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:13,600
When you look at sign language around the world, a lot of them are related to each other,

1613
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:19,120
in these large families. But Nicaraguan sign language is an exception. It developed almost

1614
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:24,800
entirely in isolation. Deaf children in Nicaragua were generally isolated from the other kids,

1615
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:30,480
and were never taught writing or signing. So in 1977, when school for the deaf opened up,

1616
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:34,880
the kids ended up inventing a language of their own, with later generations building

1617
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:40,000
on what they learned from the older kids. Linguists were absolutely stoked about this language when

1618
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,800
they heard about it, since it's a rare example of an entirely new language developing from the

1619
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:50,640
beginning. Linguists have been stuck analyzing creoles, combinations of two existing languages,

1620
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:54,400
but they've never been able to witness something this unique. In particular,

1621
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:58,160
they were really excited about the fact that it was children creating the language,

1622
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:03,360
rather than adults. Things like verb agreement and grammar conventions emerged naturally,

1623
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:07,760
without anyone teaching the kids about it beforehand. All of this can be seen as proof of

1624
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:12,880
the whole language innateness thing, since these kids seem to have that built-in understanding

1625
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:23,520
of language structure. The final word in the musical guide, an encyclopedia of classical music,

1626
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:29,920
which sat underneath the zimbal, the German word for symbol. It was defined as zschonwa,

1627
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:36,400
scha, meori, drum, fife, conclusion. It turns out that this word isn't real at all.

1628
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:45,840
It might have been a tongue-in-cheek joke, with the translation of conclusion as the final word

1629
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:51,520
in the encyclopedia. As it turns out, meori doesn't have the kind of consonant clusters found in this

1630
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:58,400
word, like two zeds followed by an x, or even a ss or sh sound. Meori dictionaries do actually

1631
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:03,280
have words for drum in conclusion, but they look nothing like zschonwa or scha.

1632
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:13,200
A strange disc was discovered in a basement cell in Crete by the Italian archaeologist

1633
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:18,960
Luigi Pernier in 1908. Different Luigi from last time, though. The disc is pretty interesting,

1634
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:24,320
and there are loads of wild ideas of what it says. Some think it's an astronomical calendar,

1635
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:30,400
an ancient computer, a board game, or even pre-Homeric poetry. It's also believed to be the very

1636
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:36,240
first printed document in the world, existing over 3,000 years before the Gutenberg Bible.

1637
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:40,640
It's absolutely clear that the characters on the disc were punched or stamped in,

1638
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,880
rather than individually carved out. This is weird for a couple reasons.

1639
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:49,920
Why was this printed when basically every other document at the time was manually inscribed?

1640
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:56,400
Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mesopotamian cuneiform were inscribed in stone or clay, and linear A and B,

1641
01:58:56,400 --> 01:59:01,120
which were found in the same area, were inscribed as well. This could mean that printing was invented

1642
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:06,080
at one point, and then disappeared for thousands of years before being invented again. But there's

1643
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:11,280
something a little suspicious about this disc. Nobody wants to actually check to see how old it

1644
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:17,200
is. The mystique surrounding the disc made it a national icon in Greece, and the main attraction

1645
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:22,640
at a museum. Some scholars have requested to get it thermoluminescence tested to figure out how

1646
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:28,160
old it is, but the Greek authorities keep denying them. This raises a question. Is this all just

1647
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:34,480
a big hoax that was made up in 1908? As of now, linguists have still tried to decipher the disc,

1648
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:39,760
but progress is looking grim. They did determine that it's probably structured similarly to linear

1649
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:45,760
A and B, where each sign represents a full syllable, since there are 45 different kinds of characters,

1650
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:51,440
and that's way bigger than any alphabet, where characters represent individual vowels or consonants.

1651
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:55,920
But there isn't much text to work with given how many characters there are, which means they won't

1652
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:00,400
be able to decode it without more samples from around this time. It would be pretty cool if the

1653
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:05,200
Greek authorities let them test its age to see if the linguists are just wasting their time,

1654
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:09,840
but for now, it remains a mystery. Swedish yes sound.

1655
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:16,400
The Swedish word for yes is sha, but in some northern communities,

1656
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:19,200
they use a sound that makes you think they're gasping for air.

1657
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:28,000
That means yes. That's it. That's the entire entry. Now you know.

1658
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:44,640
As the story goes, in 1170, the ruler of a kingdom in what is now Wales died,

1659
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:50,560
and his sons engaged in an epic King Lear-type succession battle that resulted in a civil war.

1660
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:57,440
One of his sons, Madag, thought all the fighting was too annoying and decided to leave. He sailed

1661
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:02,080
west and ended up finding America, where he built a settlement with some of his crew,

1662
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:07,200
and then promptly left. So according to this story, it wasn't Christopher Columbus in the

1663
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:12,000
Spanish who took credit for, quote-unquote, discovering the land that indigenous people

1664
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,640
in North America already inhabited, but it was actually the Welsh. In the 17th century,

1665
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:21,360
there were a lot of rumors about encounters with these so-called Welsh Indians. They usually

1666
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:26,640
involved the Welshmen being taken prisoner by indigenous Americans and set up to be executed.

1667
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:30,320
At this point, the Welshmen would start protesting or praying in Welsh,

1668
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:33,760
and his captors recognized that he's speaking the same language as them

1669
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:38,560
and decided to release him. Centuries later, once the British explorers had arrived,

1670
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:42,800
they decided to investigate to see if the stories of the Welsh Indians were true.

1671
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:48,240
In 1791, this guy wrote words in common use on different parts of the continent,

1672
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:54,640
which are very near or undeniably Welsh in both sound and sense, could not happen by chance,

1673
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:59,360
and they could not be derived from any Europeans but from the ancient Britons.

1674
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:04,240
Some of this ended up ringing true. Both languages have the words borough for bread

1675
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:09,040
and crosso for welcome, but these folks conveniently ignored the fact that almost

1676
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:14,080
every single other word had an unrecognizable translation. Part of the reason these rumors

1677
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:19,040
started is simple racism. The historian Samuel Eliot Morrison wrote that

1678
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:24,880
uneducated travelers were apt to regard every Indian language as gibberish, and so compared it

1679
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:30,720
with some known languages, such as Welsh, Basque, Hebrew, or Finnish, that was also gibberish to

1680
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:35,440
them. Everyone wanted the credit for being the brave explorers who discovered America,

1681
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:40,720
venturing into lands never before touched by humans. But instead, it was actually the indigenous

1682
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:45,440
people of that land who traveled there from Siberia, long before these explorers ventured

1683
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:50,800
anywhere. But unfortunately for them, the Europeans stormed in, slaughtered a bunch of them,

1684
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,880
systematically worked to destroy their culture and claimed it as their own.

1685
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:05,360
This Egyptian hieroglyph is part of a carving in an ancient temple and looks suspiciously

1686
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:10,560
like a helicopter. Were the ancient Egyptians a lot more technologically advanced than we thought?

1687
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:15,680
Did people travel back in time and tell them about modern flying vehicles? Did aliens make

1688
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:21,040
contact with them? Unfortunately not. The real reason is a lot less fun. It turns out that this

1689
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:27,120
stone had actually been reused. Initially, it said, he who repulses the nine. Years later,

1690
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:33,680
it was filled in and re-carved to say, he who protects Egypt and overthrows the foreign countries.

1691
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:39,360
The plaster they used to fill it had eroded away over the past 3,000 or so years, so both

1692
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:44,800
the inscriptions are partly visible simultaneously, which resulted in this strange helicopter shape,

1693
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:47,360
which isn't an actual Egyptian hieroglyph at all.

1694
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:57,840
A little known fact is that an ancient Hebrew tribe actually sailed all the way to Japan

1695
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:02,640
and influenced their writing system. Just look at all these similarities in their characters,

1696
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:07,840
except none of this actually happened. It's fiction. It's widely believed that Katakana

1697
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:13,200
is based on Chinese kanji and was developed over a thousand years ago by Japanese monks

1698
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:19,360
to annotate Chinese Buddhist texts. The characters in this image are a very tiny subset of Japanese

1699
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:29,280
characters that just happen to look similar to some Hebrew characters. In Proto-Indo-European,

1700
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:34,400
nine is noon, which is pretty similar to the word new. There's an interesting theory for why this

1701
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:40,560
might be the case. Some linguists suspect that early Proto-Europeans counted with eight fingers,

1702
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:45,040
leaving out the thumbs. So when they get to nine, they needed a new set of fingers,

1703
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:47,360
which explains why this word is similar to new.

1704
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:56,720
It turns out that the Neanderthals had a hyoid bone, this thing in their necks,

1705
02:04:56,720 --> 02:05:01,920
that is one of the main structures humans use to produce speech. And computer modeling studies

1706
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:07,360
have shown that they use it in a similar way to how we do. For non-human primates that can't talk,

1707
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:12,640
their hyoid bone is situated differently, so it isn't in the proper position to make vocalizations

1708
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:18,000
like speech possible. Now this doesn't definitively prove that Neanderthals used language,

1709
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:23,760
but it does show that they definitely might have. And that fact alone is pretty fascinating.

1710
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:29,200
Language is often seen as one of the defining features of humanity. It's what makes us human,

1711
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:31,600
but this might suggest that it's not unique to us.

1712
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:41,840
As dumb as it sounds, there is some evidence showing that you can help your language learning

1713
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:46,880
by listening to tapes while you sleep. Some Swiss researchers had a group of German-speaking

1714
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,680
participants and gave them a bunch of Dutch words to learn at 10pm one night. They split

1715
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:57,120
them up into two groups. The first group was told to go to sleep, while the other groups stayed awake,

1716
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:00,480
and all of them listened to audio of the word pairs they learned.

1717
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:04,640
At 2am, everybody was tested to see how many words they could remember.

1718
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:09,440
It turned out that the group that slept ended up remembering significantly more words.

1719
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:13,600
It's important to remember, though, that this only works because they were exposed to the words

1720
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:18,000
already when they were awake. If you put on an audiobook in Spanish while you sleep,

1721
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,320
without doing any work when you're awake, you're probably not going to wake up speaking fluent

1722
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:45,360
Spanish, especially if the record skips. This has been the Linguistics Iceberg.

1723
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:50,480
I'd like to thank the Reddit user Dragonor for creating this Iceberg meme. If you had this video

1724
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:55,280
on for background noise, and you're now scrambling to find something else to quiet your thoughts,

1725
02:06:55,280 --> 02:07:00,640
I'd recommend checking out my other Iceberg videos on philosophy and psychological experiments.

1726
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:11,520
Thank you for watching or listening. Have a great rest of your day.
