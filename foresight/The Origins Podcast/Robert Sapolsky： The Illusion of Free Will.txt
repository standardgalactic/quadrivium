Hello, and welcome to the Origins podcast. I'm your host Lawrence Krause.
Robert Sapolsky is a genius, or so says the MacArthur Foundation when they gave him a genius
grant. Whether he's a genius or not, I've known him personally and of his work for many years and
have always been impressed by both the depth and breadth of his work. You can tell
how accomplished a scientist he is by how many departments he's a member of at Stanford.
He's a professor of biology and neurology and I think neuroscience and who knows what else at
Stanford University. And he's worked on primates and neurobiology and a host of other things,
wrote a great book called Behave and he has a new book out and the new book is called
Determined, the science of life without free will. When I heard about it, I wanted to speak to
Robert. We've been for years trying to set up a time to talk in general about aspects of neurobiology
and this seemed like a good starting off point and I got to read the book before it came out
and it's a long book and for me it was a challenge initially because as someone who recognizes that
there is no such thing as free will based on the laws of physics and has seen a host of books that
I find rather tedious about free will by some by people I've known, I was a little worried about
reading this but I knew that Robert always has gems to share and the book is is chock full
of his own perceptions. It's fun just like he's fun and one can learn a lot about neurobiology
and then discuss the important question of once you accept that there is no such thing as free will
he really takes on ahead first the more difficult question of what do you do about
responsibility and guilt and blame. So in any case, we did what I love to do on the
Origins project and we talked about his own origins and he and I shared four things that I knew about
and then we had a rollicking discussion of many aspects of free will, neurobiology,
society and consciousness as well as which is a subject I've written about in my new book and I
was happy to see that it passed muster with him, one of the experts. It was a great discussion,
he's a remarkable individual and really fun to listen to and talk to. So I hope you'll enjoy
listening to it and watching it add free on our Origins project podcast on our critical mass website
where paid subscribers will get to see the whole podcast ad free. Of course you can listen to the
podcast on any on any site that podcasts can be listened to and then eventually the the video
will come up on our YouTube channel on our Origins project YouTube channel as well a few
days later usually. No matter how you watch it or listen to it, I certainly hope that you will
be as thrilled and pleased and entertained and educated as I was when I had my dialogue with
Robert Sapolsky. Well thanks so much for joining me Robert. We were saying before I pressed the
record button that we were amazed we actually never have been in the same room to our knowledge.
We've crossed paths intellectually and as you know I admire and respect you tremendously.
So it's such a thrill to finally after all this time be able to have a long discussion.
So thanks for coming on. Well thanks for having me on the Respect is Mutual.
That's great I appreciate it. This was no easy task in fact it's probably this
this was one of the hardest things I've had to do for many reasons. I want to talk about
your new book which by the time this airs will be I'm going to try and time it to the to the airing
of your new book. I have a pre-production version your book determined about free will.
One of the hardest things for me it was not an easy task to work through it for a variety of
reasons. There's a lot there first but also I come into this with the absolute conviction from
everything I know saying there's no such thing as free will. So it was hard for me you know
accepting this fact I thought well given that I don't you know think there's free will why am I
really motivated to go through this and that was hard at the beginning. But of course what's great
is that our reasons for my a priori regions for not thinking there was free will are sort of
are almost or not orthogonal but don't have much overlap. You actually know how the brain works or
at least a lot more than I do and so your arguments really were quite useful. I don't think I needed
them because basically you and I both don't think there's a magic somewhere in the middle
and that's really what you need as we'll talk about. So that was one of the reasons I found it
hard but the other is there's a lot in this book because this book covers so many different
interesting things and that was the other part. I love your mind I've always loved your mind I love
your writing and the way we think and it was just it was hard because it was a joy to read I wanted
to skip parts and I couldn't and the footnotes of which there are tremendous I as a rule I try
not to read footnotes in books but I read every footnote here because of course the footnotes
are where you get to put on all the stuff you where I really get to see how your mind works.
In any case it was worth the effort and I hope this discussion will be worth people's effort
because we're really going to go we're going to we're going to dig down and deep into into the
ideas as well as summarize them but this is an Origins podcast and I like to find out about
people's origins I'm particularly interested in yours what led you to where you to the remarkable
long and winding road that you've taken with so many branches almost like a the emergent complexity
of of a neural neural system as we'll talk about your you so I've read a little bit of
your biography that I could as much as I could find and I found out your your father was an
architect okay and and that clearly and he was an Orthodox Jew your mother was I assume as well
the more we learned the more we realized coerced yeah okay oh interesting was she
also he was from Eastern Europe but he came from Eastern Europe yeah he came over just after the
revolution as a like young adolescent a very good time to get out of that area yeah she came over
from the old country as a fetus so uh okay she didn't she didn't remember as much stuff back
there is yeah she was born in the States yeah okay and okay so that but now I want to I want to
find out a little I mean and you were brought up as an Orthodox Jew okay yeah now and one of the
things I you know I was born as a you know sort of in a secular Jewish household and brought up in
that way where I where the only thing I learned my mother kept telling me about good about being
Jewish is that you know learning was a big deal and reading she she tried to convince me that was
a big part of religion and but you obviously love learning and reading and of course
a lot of it's probably hardwired but but um who had the biggest influence you're so obviously your
father had an influence because you write about him I don't but I'd like to learn about your mother
too who for example as an architect when you were a kid I know you want you've loved gorillas right
away but what got you interested in that I don't know that and I'd like to um I'm I'm I'm not trying
to get into two uh two murky and quicksandish of uh just for psychotherapy um but I was like eight
when my mother my mother started taking me to Museum of Natural History and it was an incredible
percentage of field biologists I've encountered who like instead of growing up out in the bush and
these parents were missionaries or researchers they grew up in some urban and at some point they
they stumbled into the Natural History Museum that was it that's that's the day they imprinted on
geckos or or whatever so um we went into the primate exhibit somewhat randomly and if you ever
go in there there's this stuffed mountain gorilla like right at the entrance it may not be at the
entrance anymore but like he's been on their postcards forever and he was shot by like Carl
Ackley in 1912 probably with Teddy Roosevelt and his gunbear but it's this like diorama of this
taxidermed mountain gorilla silverback and like something clicked and if I'm going to get all all
fuzzy here and stuff um like both of my grandfathers died more than 50 years before I was born kind
of thing and everything and like something on some visceral level this just seemed like this would
be the greatest grandfather on earth and I just wanted to go live inside the diorama I think that's
that's what was going on there that's where it came from okay I was wondering there had to
been something because where you grew up in New York and you know there's not a lot of
silverback gorillas at least non-metaphorical ones that's why I wanted to live in the diorama
you but I'm still trying to come to terms with the fact that Brooklyn has now become a trendy place
to live it was not then yeah yeah no it wasn't then exactly but uh but you know it but it gave you
that opportunity which as we'll talk about you know gave you good luck and and and um and and
had a huge influence now I understand where that came from um and you basically did live in that
diorama I mean you you willing willfully chose as soon as you could as far as I can see to actually
experience to go and for then for three decades to continue to try and live in that diorama at some
level yeah it really impressed me and amazed me and also made me envious in some sense but
I'll talk about privilege and good luck yeah yeah no well but you you know well
but for whatever reason you you took advantage of the privilege and good luck um I would say
it would be grit but I know better um but so so that's interesting so your mother actually had
the biggest influence that way what about reading I assume uh I'm always interested in in you know
reading was vitally significant for me and I'm always interested in what did you did you read a lot
when you were a kid and if so did that example come from either parent or no um oh I read
obsessively and like I I guaranteed I was going to be like kicked in the rear in
schoolyard perpetually by I don't know in fourth grade like who's her best friend SA and I said
books are my best friend oh my god this kid has no instinct for how not to just beg to be abused
and bullied um yeah books were were pretty great um it's it's tempting to do a whole escapism thing
but I think just part of it was also just getting padded on the head that this was like a nice metric
for being a good good compliant boy were they in that available in the house or I mean I mean uh
or or not I mean what does that an example or something you picked up again I'm interested
just in comparing my to my notes to myself in some ways to say um a fair number it was it was not
quite a book obsessed house but there is like a decent number there but once once libraries
started to be a part of the picture well we did have I I do you remember the book of knowledge
yeah of course oh my god we had the book of knowledge and like I would get up early like on
Sunday morning and just read the book where you could see like an article in there about
like this newly finished ship called the Titanic and is like this ancient is this phenomenal
yeah no it's yeah I yeah I love those things I and I and I end up getting a subscription to
book of knowledge type stuff the time life books I'm like remember that my 20 volume thing was my
first thing I spent my allowance on it when I was a kid because because there were books in my house
but not but not but not yeah not enough and not that kind yeah yeah and so yeah one of them would
show up like every six and they smelled so good yeah yeah first came out of the box I still have
them I still I just put them up and I ain't I'm never going to get rid of them because it it
means so much thought there's so many you know they and of course they're outdated but that's
what's great to great to that's what's great about science is they're outdated it makes you
make progress and they admitted somewhere afterward that that was wrong yeah yeah exactly that's the
being wrong as well you know I I talked about that my new book I think admitting you're wrong
and not knowing is a key part of science um now okay so now I see where the sort of background
by the way as orthodox Jewish whether your mother was coerced in or not did they did they have
plans for you I mean my mother wanted me to be a doctor my brother to be a lawyer but did they
did they want that kind of thing for you was there did you feel any pressure to be a professional
in that way um frantic ceaseless crushing heartless pressure to become a doctor yeah okay where my my
wife and I have like tried to figure out the chronology because it was a long time ago but we
think this is the case uh that my father started off in med school like in the second year of the
depression and there's going to be a cancer but and ran out of money and uh never finished um like
we've we've got his like stethoscope and microscope in the back of some closet upstairs from 1930
whatever um you know there's a couple of possible holes in the story but at least that that
can hold together broadly so he uh you know he knew how to do drafting he had gone to
stuyvesant high school in new york and like i remember to do that so he got a job doing that
at an architectural firm and then decided to start going to architectural night school and
before it was over with he was a professor of architecture kind of thing but yeah not quite
daily but not far from about the highest possible calling would be to go like be a doctor and cure
cancer all right well okay that's it did he talk to you much about i mean did he talk to you much
about science or his or his interests or didn't i mean no that doesn't happen kids often forget
to ask their parents what they're interested in but um they came and sort of frenzied monologues
he was he was a very very large presence but he was not a very approachable one
you know he he'd had a tough time of things and uh like he was doing his best yeah yeah but well
he obviously did but and it's it's interesting to see that that pressure came from a different
place for him for me and i've already said this a bunch i'm sure i think in different contexts my
neither my parents finished high school but but the i and for them there was especially important
to be a doctor because it represented you know going beyond and and and and uh and and i again
one when i got my first i got a fancy job at harvard and i never forget my my mother phoned my
my then wife at the time and immediately said he still can go to medical school there's still time
uncanny i had the same when i was getting like trying to pick where i was going to go
have a job i got an offer from like Cornell med school i'm a neuro there and so well i'm
considering it and coming back to new york whatever and they said that would be a good inside
connection if you decide oh that is freakish that you know that is that's amazing oh i'm
glad i brought it up i wasn't gonna but that's really how that is freakish now you well i have
to ask you this did you did you learn swahili i mean i know you started till did you ever like
did you learn enough to yes i'm i'm terrible at languages but it was just kind of by force
i became sort of functionally fluent by about my fifth or sixth year there and all is done
as dk since then um i i took swahili for two years in college and it being the times that it was
the book was entirely written for like african americans thinking about root stuff so it was mostly
like learning how to talk about charlie parker and swahili stuff okay well at least and it turned
out that the instructor was tans in the end so i learned tans in the end swahili which is
like showing up in the bronx speaking the queen's english or something to kenya but you know i was
i was eventually able to get by but i'm i'm pretty bad languages i should have pointed out that i mean
people may wonder if who don't know why i even brought that up but you actually decided when you
were still a teenager or early a teenager that in addition to learning about if you wanted to learn
about gorillas you would learn so you started to learn swahili when you were in your early teens
right um yeah yeah that's and i was writing fan letters to various primatologists when i was in
high school and eventually got to sit at the feet of one for four years and that was a major
disappointment yeah i i sort of was intent i think i had to have been the only like jewish kid
in brooklyn in the 1970s sitting on the west side independent train the b train reading a biography
of joe mo kenyatta day after the day yeah that would have gotten some it would be interesting to see
what would happen today if you're doing that it's a different world but um you went so you that that
it was kind of natural then to major um you went to harvard right and did biological anthropology
yeah and um and and you know and that's sort of i guess biological anthropology i'm wondering why
wasn't like uh um uh more i mean biological anthropology is not directly focused on on primates
you could have done primatology and i'm wondering what what what what well at the time this was
just at the time that like the great sociobiology shittstorm hit in fact it was amazing it was
eolson did you take classes from him or something or my first semester is when he published sociobiology
and yeah like spending college like arguing about whether he or luenton made sense and
it was incredibly stimulating time um you know at the time a bioanthro included primatology they
shortly after that things got bad enough and there had been enough like
drive-by shootings between the social and for people in the bioanthro people that they split
into two departments but yeah that was that was you do both yeah and it's part of you know and
you and as you say and and it's clear i mean you are one of the things i admire and i'm jealous of
is you know i've always liked the idea of being a generalist and you you have you've been a generalist
in it in you know in a clear way i mean we achieving levels of levels in a in a wide variety
fields and it's nice that you could start that generalization with bioanthro and it was it was
for and it was a low-profile department so you could get away with like just happening not to
take all sorts of requirements and things and it was it was nobody paid to their part and then it
was very quiet um it's sort of around then that i then started my like am i a neurobiologist or
primatologist crisis because said primatology got at whose feet i was sitting uh got sick my
freshman year um he was fine everything turned to buddy canceled all of his classes um including
a couple i was going to take and sort of at the last minute saying yeah maybe i'll take an intro
neuro class uh they probably they probably have something to say about behavior instead of just
us evolutionary biologist that was blown away by it and like ever since deciding on my neurobiologist
around my primatologist and sort of that was that so you anticipated my question because i was
wondering if you did by you know biological anthropology and you like primates why you then
went to do uh you know your phd in neurobiology and and now that i guess that's the reason i would
seem like a jump but uh and sort of by then the the way the totally intellectually fabricated
way that i saw them as connected is like i go study behavior and stuff and baboons and exactly at
the point where i would say wow what's going on inside i'm not going to lesion disguise hippocampus
because like i've known him for years and his mother was great um so i'll go do stuff to rats
in a lab and just what i'm learning about the brain there and saying huh i wonder if this works in
like real animals out in the real world i get to go back to the baboon so they were synergistic um
you know i couldn't decide which yeah actually i was well i guess it's because of the love of
the bamboos or the great apes that because i was going to say you know i've i actually just had a
discussion with peter singer and and who uh who's lovely interesting talk to and he we talked about
animal experimentation and and some of the silly things that have been done in the name of psychology
on animals the torturing of animals that didn't you know in order to try and understand who humans
work when it was clear often that if you want to really understand how humans work you probably
should be having humans and and and and you know and a certain certain torching of rats was probably
not going to be huge insights into post-traumatic stress syndrome in humans and stuff but but uh
but i was but you didn't want but you know you could have chosen work on humans but you just
found apes more interesting um i would say more understandable but maybe the word is more palatable
or more uh i wanted to get out and do field work somewhere in the middle of nowhere yeah no i can
understand that uh you know and in your general you you are lucky to have a position that that
actually explicitly demonstrates your your generalness um so i mean again i always wanted but i didn't
always because i wanted to i started a degree in history and well as as well as physics but i
quickly learned that the intellectual baggage required me to do a degree in mathematics as well
as physics and that took up all the time but but you you have you have professors in biological
sciences neurology and this really always amazed me neurological science and neurosurgery
and and and my mother would have been very happy if i was a professor of neurosurgery but well you
better bet i trotted that out when i went back for conica yeah you know what well yeah yeah i think
at one point the neurosurgery department had some sort of visiting committee and they suggested
they needed a little more basic researchers in the department so i was friends with the chief
of neurosurgery who said hey can we put your name on the letterhead oh ever since then i've
been a member of the department and i i i have to say i at one point i was vice dean of the medical
school of case western reserve for about six months but uh and i don't think i ever told my mother
i worried about what that would imply so but um but you know it did intrigue me so your professor
i mean and it and it's quite appropriate given all of the breadth of your the lovely connections
you make between neurobiology and and and behavior of of human behavior and and behavior of of great
apes it's it is a lovely symbiotic relationship and it's and i guess it took someone like you to
realize it was that that was useful i'm intrigued that you and i guess i'm intrigued and impressed
that among that collection of departments in which your professor psychology isn't one of them
and i was wondering i was intrigued by that um
that's a good question nor is anthropology there although if they've also purged like
virtually everyone except the social and cultural anthropologists so that that that war has been won
there um i don't know i talk to psychologists i can i can occasionally say the right nouns and
get away with it but yeah clearly some of the stuff i've done has involved my having to
like interact with them a lot yeah yeah no it's interesting to me that anyway let we'll get we'll
you people will see when we talk about the context of trying to address this question of free will
which i want to now move to you mentioned you obviously you've agonized i guess that's the
right way to put it you've thought about free will for a long time obviously
and agonizing i said by agonizing i don't think the agonizing was i i suspect you
recognized like me that there was that there was no obvious obvious scientific reason why
there should be free will but so maybe didn't agonize by the science but you agonized to try
and understand how to how to demonstrate explicitly or address this question how long
you've been thinking about is an issue that's always that's always bothered you or um well
i think once i started getting acne that was right around the time when logical things happened
like i was having all sorts of like angst and the contradictions of and you know during one
sort of particularly uh trotated uh here i woke up at two in the morning one night
and said oh i get it god doesn't exist what's going on and then shortly after that was oh
and there's no free will and that was followed by and it's a totally empty empty in different
universe so that cured everything right there and lessened all it did for me too i i didn't
i'm gonna try to have an epiphany that way in fact i meant to ask you that you i noticed that age
13 is when you when you kind of made that it's real had this realization at least that's what
your this bio says age 13 i i for me it was a gradual thing but i actually sort of became
i mean age 13 was when i broke bar mitzvah and now the that experience enough was enough to
turn me off religion forever if i hadn't if it hadn't already been that way was it was the age
13 a coincidence for you too or no uh no not at all of of course i would say just from focusing
on the ways in which often ancient and well-established cultures have influenced your
life and in which the purpose of every generation is to inculcate their offspring into the same
cultural values uh you know age 13 is when they're really pressing court on that one yeah so
that's kind of when inevitably the this doesn't make any sense and this isn't right
it so now you mentioned it though it shows that they understood neuroscience a little bit
because you point out how in fact the prefrontal cortex and i mean it's that period when things
are developing so if you're going to inculcate um that's probably a really good time to do it
and especially do it in a way where they somehow make you feel guilty for a pogrom that happened
in the 15th century yeah so the very reason you could do right now is make your children
have to put that as well and well guilt is a huge part of that i think um but you know it's
interesting when you said you smiled when you went and cured everything when you woke up in the middle
of the night and i want to follow that up we'll come back and near the end of this um six or seven
hour discussion um uh to this question because almost you almost apologize or make it appear
as if recognizing that there's no free will is and should be a depressing thing but one could
often say and i'm often asked that i mean it isn't recognizing there's no meaning no cosmic
meaning to the universe and no god also a depressing thing and we'll talk about its impact on morals
because you talk about that but for me it was exactly the opposite and maybe it's just the wiring
it it was it's liberating and and and and energizing to know both of those things because
it makes sort of it makes you understand your place and it makes every moment in some ways
more precious if you understand that there's nothing guiding it and there's no and and that
you're here for a short time and and your delta set of cards and um and and that's life and you
might as well use it well you're you're made of more resilient stuff than me somebody somebody
did right by you leading up to that point or somebody's nutrient level when you were a fetus
did right by you but yeah that's the notion i mean this is um i just agreed to blurb a manuscript
for a book of someone a scientist who experienced just a horrendous nightmares family tragedy
and the book is about like how he has found comfort in science and i sure can't wait to read it
because like how'd he do that um science just seemed like the only intellectually sustainable
default states to try to understand things but it's sure does not give comfort much
yeah well i guess again it's all in it's long on the attitude i i do i since we're both atheists
in that sense but i obviously for some reason or other i've been labeled it it's it's higher in my
profile and because i've spent time trying to protect things like the teaching revolution in
schools and got got involved in that uh because the biologists weren't doing it enough in my opinion
that's why right you you died for our sins to find creationism but uh but because of that um
i spent a lot of time talking to people about this issue and i i do think that that that really
that realizing one talks about loss of faith and even that that's already propaganda or that's already
promoting a reality that doesn't need to be it's not a lot you don't lose anything you gain i think
and if you indicate people that you can gain by making every you know recognizing every moment
for precious if you have a mentality and you recognize it then you don't have to then then then
you gain anyway i think i that's the kind of you know if i'm going to do a feel good or try to
try to be a you know um i don't try to be advice sorry uh one of those kind of advice scientists
but but but but if i did i mean that's what i think that's the that's the argument and i'm
going to try and argue it later on i i i i struggled a lot with the last half of this book
because i could see your angst we'll get to it um but i think there's i i can see a happy way out
and maybe it isn't but we'll see if i we'll see if we can think about it well i i think i finally
it took me like a huge amount of time to get to the end there because like how can this not just
be well this sucks and is pretty demoralizing but you know we're adults that's the way that we're
to see that there is actually a good feature of it and a liberating one um i sure can't
convince myself of it most of the time and not only did i write the damn book i read it even at
various points um yeah it's a it's a hard pull but it's kind of it's reminding me of that great
rebranding that atheism has tried to do in recent years we are not just about what isn't
we are not just a theist we're not just like saying i don't believe there's a god and as
always we're at it i don't believe there's an easter bunny no it's a positive and the whole
rebranding is humanism and to be able to say like the source of human goodness is human
um that's that's not just saying you know it wasn't in seven days that the world got created
and like smoothing is probably not a good thing most of the time um yeah there's the
there's rooms for for positivity in there yeah i think well i think you know i well i think
as i'll argue as you know and i i did was reminded of a quote from my friend my late friend
chris rihigins here i mean i don't think we have a choice um ultimately and and and i think that we
we should you know i'm getting ahead of myself but in some sense part of the last part of the
book is saying well we have how can we we we we wanting there to be free will and believing
their free will is so is so ingrained how can we get over it but i think we just recognize that
that that not not thinking not thinking in terms of free will is just part of the way we're wired
to and that's we don't have the we don't have the choice to not want to not emotionally want
there to be free will we have the we don't have any choice i'll agree with you there but but we
can intellectually through through learning will argue at some level recognize rationally that there
isn't but but i think um you know recognizing that we don't have the free will to not to not
emotionally believe in free will it's just something we have to accept i think and should
not struggle with um to some extent i mean robert robert rivers like one of the pioneering
social biologists during one period got very interested in publishing stuff on the evolution
of the capacity for self deception essentially saying if you're going to have a species that
can know the future like the only way you're going to get up in the day is the ability for
self deception interestingly equally interesting is the notion that evolution of self deception
because the best way to convince people of your laws is to believe your laws and competition
and all of that so he got very interested in that but just the very notion that if you're
going to be this smart um it's a pretty helpful thing oh yeah yeah well i always say we all every
one of us has to believe six impossible things for our breakfast just to get up you like your
colleagues you like your job you like your spouse whatever it is but you know you just
got to get out of bed and and um and that's okay i mean but a great thing is to recognize
it's okay to recognize it's an illusion but to but to um but to recognize it doesn't diminish
the fact that we know we have it and say and almost revel in it but anyway let's get let's
get to you know i could have spent time talking about the last book behave which is a precursor
to this but this book determined is about free will and by the way it seemed to me not only
if you agonized about it for years when did you really start to think about it was when you
realized that there's no god at the same time as when you begin to think yeah and then and then
you've actually also put your not your money while you may have money where your mouth is
you've actually gotten involved and if in consequently if there is no free will then
there's a question of responsibility and punishment which we'll get to and you've got involved in
prisons in court cases and really taking this on which i really admire as well i you've internalized
it or at least shown that well before it's lauded i should just basically say it's a totally fun hobby
because it's a totally fun hobby you find out about some of the most
horrific things that can happen to people and as a result of that damage some of the most
horrific things they could do to other people and like what totally broken system it is blah blah
but it's kind of like it's cool trying to convince 12 skeptics who are getting to
decide whether or not this person is going to be in jail for life to think differently
it almost never works and it's cool to have a smart da during cross examination who wants to
argue with so you know it's another version of that but well it's okay i i always tell people
what you're saying is just simply you have to enjoy what you're doing i i tell people that
most scientists most scientists you know don't become scientists to save the world
your cancer or whatever they do it because they it's cool and they like it and it's in the process
if something good comes out of it that's great that's great too but because dry ice is just like
fun to play with exactly magnets and all the rest i often ask people why they didn't become
physicists i was going to say because it's why it's so neat why didn't you anyway by the way
did you ever did did did you ever toy with that the physical sciences or as always biological
sciences that you always biological and always like cutting every corner to like avoid the chemistry
requirements and stuff just just not my temperament i've i've had to spend years and years filling in
the the crater holes of where i didn't get the basic information that's okay that's okay because
you know that's what it's for i you know i learned a lot more physics after i got my phd than before
anyway but uh you know that's where you yeah it's all right because that's called like long learning
now the basic premise of determined um basically
that there are you know and and and you might say why is this why is there so much here
to just say two things there's no one caused decision making no decision is made by some
magical thing it's always caused by series of causes which then have causes which then as you
say at the beginning of the book turtles all the way down um and the second is that if that's the
case then what then respond the notion of responsibility for your decision making
if if there's if there's no random no spontaneous decision making if there's no free will if
everything is based on as on on some physical biological uh chemical process then then we
have to re we have to renounce or at least re rethink what we mean by taking responsibility
for our actions those are the two if i were to summarize is that a reasonable summary of of the
of the general context of the book yes okay um and now having done that well well i want to unpack
it and there's a lot to unpack um um and um and uh and i did i have to say i you know i was cursing
you last night when i was reading the last hundred pages and and i was staying up all night um but uh
but i had to i took solace from the realization that i had no choice in the matter and and you
know the quote from i was alluding to it from chris rations when he was asked about free will
you know his quote he said he said yes i have free will i have no choice but that's wrong but i think
if we just said yes i feel i have free will i have no choice that'd be right now it reminds me of
like one of the theological loops for getting to that i can't remember Aquinas or who knows what
are no doubt someone much more closed-minded than that saying like god is so glorious so amazing
and having granted us free will that we have no choice but to worship it
perfect that captures it yeah um yeah that's great i gotta remember that's good well look i
periodically i'm going to read quotes of yours because i like them and it'll let me a chance to
give you a chance to expand upon them obviously not in as much detail as the book but at least give
a sense um but basically right off in the very beginning um where you talk about turtles all
the way down you say to reiterate when you behave in a particular way which is to say when your brain
has generated a particular behavior it is because of the determinism that came just before which was
caused by the determinism just before that and before that all the way down the approach of
this book is to show how that determinism works to explore how the biology over which you had no
control interacting with environment over which you had no control made you you and when people
claim that there are causeless causes of your behavior that they call free will they have a
fail to recognize or not learned about the determinism lurking beneath the surface
and or be erroneously concluded that the rarefied aspects of the universe that do work
indeterministically can explain your character morals and behavior now um so the point is
you see you know to say that that things are deterministic is fine and then it'd be a very
short book and a lot of people have written not so short books that basically don't say any more
than that and i won't alert to some to some of those people um but you want to talk about the
biology of this and and i think that the neurobiology of it and i think that's what makes it incredibly
enlightening to learn about this but but you you basically um uh come down to say okay
you need to look at all of science uh to do this and as a generalist you uh you you you
it fits you in your your sort of natural predilections crucially all discipline all these
disciplines and you talk about many disciplines collectively negate free will because they are
all interlinked constituting the same ultimate body of knowledge if you talk about the effects
of neurotransmitters on behavior you are also implicitly talking about the genes that specify
the construction of those chemical messengers and the evolution of those genes the field of
neurochemistry genetics and evolutionary biology can't be separated and it goes on so
this notion that that there's this biological basis requires us and we'll talk about each of
those aspects particularly but but but logically you frame the argument as there's three there's
sort of four complementary ways of thinking and i want to get you sort of to elaborate on that you
say we have a choice the world is deterministic and there's no free will the world is deterministic
and there is free will the world is not deterministic and there's no free will
and the world is not deterministic and there is free will so um
we're gonna we're gonna unpack those more carefully but do you want to do you want to
give it a sort of a an expansion of those of of of each of those areas and what the
central concepts of why there are fallacies and some and not others yeah um and you know
two by two matrix where two of the four are a lot more interesting than the other two
one of them makes no sense at all which is the world is not deterministic but you don't have
free will and i i don't quite know how you get there and i don't think i've read anyone
that's just making sure like fill out the matrix there um the there is not determinism
and there is free will is this somewhat off in the ozone view of libertarian philosophy libertarian
in an intellectual sense rather than political and you know i got pulled into reading any of
this philosophy stuff kicking and screaming but it appears to be like a very minority view
um the most common one is that yeah yeah it's a deterministic world i'm not a uh
i'm not a lot i'm not a whatever yet there's like atoms and we're made of cells and like
there's rules through the physical universe and stuff but somehow somehow somehow somehow
that's compatible with us still having free will and this compatibleism one is what i spend
like most of the book here tearing my hair out because what the polls show is 90 95 percent
of philosophers say that they are deterministic compatible lists and like a shocking number
of neuroscientists when you really back them up in a corner and you try to get them to look at
what it is that they just said or advocated um but it's this notion that yeah of course
like i'm a modern 21st century all of that um and we're made of stuff and the universe has rules
and all that but somehow somehow somehow there's room for this intangible thing to still be lurking
in there and that's the essence that's the us of us and that's the us of us that gives us agency
and of course the fourth truly lunatic fringe version of the matrix is the one that i'm saying
which is it's a completely deterministic world and there's no free will whatsoever
compatibleism is incompatible with the way the world works okay great and a premise which i
which i agree with as a physicist and i was you know so i have my will get to the some of the
physical arguments but it's so it's for me it's wonderful to see the biological basis as well
and but but as a physicist though it seems to me that that that's clear the the it's certainly
interesting that 90 percent of the we'll get to it we'll get to the fact that you spend a lot of
time it doesn't say much about philosophy um which is fine because um you know and uh and by the way
it's not just me you know some people think i trash philosophy too much but i again was talking
to peter simmer singer who's a philosopher and it was unfunded it was fun to see him trash
philosophy because a lot of philosophers talk about how animals don't have rights because
it's clear they don't have rights i mean as if as if there's you know and and we'll get to it but
it's almost low hanging fruit in some some ways to see the arguments that that are presented okay
that's great that that that puts the put things in context but you actually mentioned and i think
it's worthwhile saying what do you mean by free will and what do you mean by determinism the next
thing you talk about that and so give it a chance to sort of briefly explain what you mean by free
will and what you mean by determinism well this is where everybody like spends half the conference
on arguing about yeah definitions and stuff um but i think well maybe the place to start defining
free will um is what it's not even though lots of people go through this and this is a super
influential way of seeing free will where there isn't because it's one of what runs
through the entire criminal justice system you got somebody on trial and essentially trials revolver
and three questions did this person after they figure out what the person did did the person
intend to do it did they know what the consequences were likely to be and did they understand that
there were alternatives they could have done something else and if they answered those are yes
that's it the person showed free will and lock them up um and an equivalent myopia has run through
sort of one field of like neurobiologists thinking about free will and this is from this like landmark
famous experiment in the 1980s by benjamin libitt and you've read any damn paper on the biology
second paragraph out comes libitt and you want to scream libitt's the one who's done that study
that's the famous one he sat people down and basically said here do this do this behavior
and do it whenever you feel like it press this button and you know whenever you feel like it
and we're going to hook you up to all sorts of like modern ways to see what's going on in your
brain and your muscles and all of that and out of it came this incredible finding so you put
people in there and like you're monitoring what's happening in their brains when they decide to do
something and what they reported was at the moment that someone said that's when i got the intention
to press the button you could already tell from their brain like up to a few seconds before that
they had decided to push the button oh my god everybody learned neuroscientists have just shown
your brain knows before you do with of course this ridiculous like dichotomy there but like
people have been fighting about it ever since was the do can you tell the difference between
when you intend to do something and when you know that you intend to do it and was there a better way
of measuring the milliseconds and like like there's still papers being published saying things like
lib it had his head up as he was so wrong like 40 years later people were still fighting over it
because it's essentially the question of when you believe you intend to do something
has this imaginary separate construct your brain already decided to do it and
both in that route and in the courtroom that's the most ridiculously useless thing to do
because like the metaphor i use it's like trying to review a movie based on only seeing the last
three minutes of it because whether it's in the courtroom or whether it's hanging with lib it and
his detractors in both cases you're not asking the critical question yes yes yes the guy intended to
do this and knew he could have done other yes yes yes the person did or didn't intend before this
part of their brain had a bunch of action potentials where did that intent come from
and if you're going to talk about free will you're not off the hook if you just say the person
intended to do that where did that intent come from why did that psych 101 freshman show up to
do this experiment for lib it that day instead of like coming in and stealing the guy's laptop and
sneaking out why was that where does intent come from and the answer is as you figure that out
that's where any semblance of free will goes down the drain okay that's great that's that's great
let me let me i was going to go to lib it anyway but and we'll take a break for a second to talk
about determinism because i want you to want you to explain it too but but since you brought up
lib it and i and when i was writing my book on consciousness obviously i had to address that
but i you know it never it never seemed to strike me as a problem because all it indicates is it
confirmed my i should say my pre my predilection in advance which was confirmed by everything i read
about consciousness which is it consciousness is just a surface phenomena so yeah i mean okay so
people report that's what but but everything we know it says you really don't know what's your
perception of what's going on it's totally different than what's going on in your brain
and so okay so that proves it big deal what does that prove it just proves what you kind of
know anyway that people a people's sense of why they're doing what they're doing is um is is uh
is is wrong it's the same reason you know philosophers could come up and say um there's
there's a determinism but but but there's no free will why it's because um reason is the slave of
passion as you might have said yeah if you if you really want that to be the case you can find a
reason for it but it's no but but lib it i mean it's fascinating as far as you know there's still
debate about whether that delay was really there although you pointed out at one point there's
some evidence that the prefrontal cortex begins to experience some some i don't know whether it's
an action potential tens up to 10 seconds before which i was shocked by which is when they they went
from moving from medieval electroencephalograms on the skull to modern imaging stuff and to go back
to 10s it's that point when people start arguing can we tell the difference between intent and an
urge are we seen urged and it's at that point where you say you know this is sort of interesting
and i have like all sorts of respectable colleagues who have spent a lot of time working on this problem
but it's not where you're going to prove or disprove free will because you got there for the
last three minutes for the end of it okay and we'll get to the fact that it's a lot more than
the last three minutes you have to go through hours days years millennia and millions of years
but but let's but let's just it just to clarify our definitions so i think you've discussed that
a little bit let's talk about determinism and in the context of what you mean and maybe in
context of applause or or someone else well not not a Laplacian demon
which is the other he always has to come up in the second paragraph also just somewhere a little
bit okay they they check the boxes i held off to three paragraphs before it did so i am a maverick
um determinism i basically define it by exclusion which is you look at why something happened
and as soon as you're informed enough to know that all sorts of things influence stuff that
we're not aware of that could be very distal and time or place that could be subtle that could be
subliminal blah blah blah etc etc it's when you look why something has happened and there's no
contributing factor that requires invoking magic that's the key point they invoking magic we'll
get to that and as i say later i think reminds me of my favorite sydney harris cartoon which i'll
remind you of if you don't know of it let's um point later but um but this okay so that's the
that's sort of the the question of whether there's magic or whether there's or whether
things are you know or not really that i agree that's what you really mean by determinism if there's
some if the laws of nature somehow break down somewhere in the middle um and given that the
laws of nature are deterministic and one of the things i i hope to i know whether correct i hope
to change your picture of is is when we get to quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is deterministic
i think you've been led astray there although you know it you know it you it's fine that you
the argument is that might not be and you could still show it doesn't make a difference but i
i think it's even it's you don't even have to worry about that well i was in a path of last night
saying oh my god i had the nerve to write two chapters about quantum mechanics and we're talking
i'm talking with you tomorrow so you've just confirmed everything that i knew had to be working
which is like calling me a dilettante as a compliment no no no but it's okay i mean it's
it's okay because what i in some sense it was conservative i would i would i'm gonna be generous
but i would say where i would disagree with you you go overboard and then show that even if it's
overboard it doesn't make a difference anyway so it's but but i but we'll talk about that
but but i do want to get i mean central to all of this just to make it clear and and i you know
that my understanding is from your book and my other things is the same is that we realize that we
that most of that are conscious what we define as consciousness we define as intent
what we perceive as all of these things is is just our awareness is just the tip of an iceberg that
that that it's the last stage of of a of a detailed behavior in the brain that we still
don't understand and we understand contributing factors but that's that this sense of free will
like everything else like even our sense of consciousness is somehow opposed to occlusion
i mean we're piecing together a world in which we have an us and in our brain and a me and and
there's some continuity and and that's that's that's what our brains is doing but it doesn't
but it doesn't that's the that's the end result not the beginning is that are we
perfect reasonable to say yep here okay now one of the ways to to to
to demonstrate this other than just talking about the fact that reporting is unreliable
and by the way it was um i in i know you read the that part of my book on that and
as the experiments say michael gazanaga on on the split brain thing were for me just so overwhelming
that you that you invent this perfectly rational explanation which is obviously
totally false for why you're doing something but you give lots of examples because you know
what you're talking about i i just sort of read a few and i appeared to know what i'm talking about
but um but one one of the ways you can show that people um that this insensitive free will is an
illusion is is an experiment a psychology experiment that this sense of agency is illusory um is uh
is um is having people push a button when their hands are being controlled by something else you
want to you want to talk about that for something i found that quite interesting yeah that's that's
the one that really pushes lots of people over the edge there there are means these days one one
like standard one is this very cool thing transcranial magnetic stimulation um where you can
stimulate a certain part of the brain and make somebody do something like this is not suddenly
make them become a libertarian when they weren't but this is like you could make their index finger
contract no matter what you try to do and if it's done subtly enough you will believe you
decided to do that i mean i've had that done on me and it's the weirdest thing imaginable
or there's all sorts of ways of manipulating the libit scenario where they add like an extra bell
or something which you were told is driven by your volitional intentional doing whatever
and where they can manipulate that in ways where you will feel as if you decided to wait a little
bit longer that time before buzzing it there's it's amazing i mean it's wonderful it's wonderful
the control you can have the to just i mean to to explicitly demonstrate these things which one
could talk about vaguely i love that and you really feel like you you're pressing you're
choosing to press that button you've had it done on you it's it's the weirdest thing it's a good
thing i didn't believe in free will beforehand or else i would have stopped believing in free will
but you know we know this there's incredibly smart people who are paid a whole lot of money
to make you believe you really want to buy some nonsense crap that they're advertising you know
it shows how much you want to believe in free will that you can do an experiment like that
where you have this sense of agency and and it's completely completely explicitly an illusion
because it was created and yet it doesn't it that's not sufficient to convince people and
will need a lot more as well and you spend a lot of time because you want to talk about you want
to try and address all of the arguments that you've heard over the years i think that you're trying
to finally address it say you know because you've heard all of them but you then you then go to
consciousness itself where you i was really pleased to say that you know obviously i think it's
right because it agrees with me but but um but that what you know consciousness is an epiphenomena
i love that where you point which which by the way gnome chomsky you said to me in a different
context but he said but when you say consciousness is an irrelevant hiccup which i was i i'm gonna
quote that it's fantastic um and and um the the key part of this irrelevant hiccup which is really
central and and this is the whole part of of the the question the the hard problem of consciousness
as people might say some people have said is what is what you know some people say the hard
consciousness problem conscious is what is the we that that makes us we but the really
interesting question me is what what gives us the illusion of a we that's that's the problem i
want to answer but but um but you say something like our brains generate a suggestion and we
then judge it this dualism suggests thinking back centuries so it's it it enters into even
i guess into into sort of the parlance of at least some of neuroscience and a lot of philosophy
that somehow there's a separation between our brain and the we you want to elaborate on that a
little bit in your perspective of that and it's totally false and just to show sort of the pedigree
that comes with like arguably the most influential compatibilist philosopher on earth right now
talks about exactly that model with a possibility generator an idea generator that comes and then
you pick then the dichotomously pristine made of marshmallow you floating around up there picks
among the possibilities based on your learning experiences and your values and all that and
like that's that's where free will slips in yeah and i and that and you i think i want to i want
to there's an elephant in the room here and it's dan dan it um and and and i do want to i do want
mention that because it seems to me it demonstrates i know dan and i've been a friend of mine for a
long time but it amazes me how can how someone who is remarkable in his arguments about many things
can be so confused and illogical that somehow um obvious nonsense like that
if he can be that confused logical it should make you suspicious about the rest of the of the field
yes and just to show where i think that's coming from um like i i tiptoed around him with kid gloves
in so far as i think a lot of his values come through a lot of his philosophizing in ways that
i think tell us about how he's gotten some very wrong conclusions um how can he be so smart that
he concludes that this quote that gives it all away in one of his talks and you can find the
zooing versions of it on youtube in one of his books saying oh my god i wouldn't want to live
in a world in which no one thought there was free will because they'd just be running a muck and
rapist and violence and besides we wouldn't be able to feel like we earned our prizes
yeah yeah yeah that's why the guy is invested in free will um there's not a whole lot of people
who are saying oh my god if people stop believing in free will i won't be able to feel like i earned
my low socioeconomic status and my abusive parents and my yeah i will come to that i think you
mentioned that very thing at the end and i want to talk about i want to talk about how a way out
of that too maybe it'll help dan but um but um oh good but but you know what is surprising is to
hear dan is you know like me and in many ways well and always a more well-known athiast but
it's so ridiculous to hear that sentence because you could replace free will with religion and god
and he would argue completely the opposite i don't want to live in a world where there's where
people didn't believe in there's god because if they did then they're running a muck and like
dan don't you see the complete illogic of that and i i must say i thought it would have blessed
me with my endowed chair yeah yeah exactly yeah exactly god wouldn't but but you know but and i
don't want to pick on dan too much although i think he deserves it in this case um uh
is this all of this argument that somehow there's a there's a generator or you're inventing something
that no one's ever seen or measured that somehow allows you around get around the problem that
there's no evidence whatsoever and every logical argument you think of shows there's no place for
free will well it's and uh later on we'll talk about that reminds me of the god of the gaps
argument the more we learn the plate the less place there is for free will to exist it's a very
similar argument it when i was reading the book i wrote on god of the gaps at one point later on in
the book um but let me remind you this sydney harris cartoon which you can use in your lectures
if you haven't um it's two physicists at a blackboard have you seen that that that thing
or was a long equation and then and then in the middle it says and then a miracle occurs
and then one of the guys says the other i think you should be a little more explicit at at that
step right there but it's exactly that right it's it's perfect it's exactly that and and
you have to presume magic but what intrigued me i do want you to elaborate on one thing it's a
little almost the last sentence of the of um of um oh yeah in of that particular section of the book
you say um okay thinking that it's sufficient to really know about the intent in the present
is far worse than just intellectual blindness far worse than believing that is the very first
turtle on the way down that's floating in the air in a world such as we have it's deeply
ethically flawed as well and you just leave that hanging there and and maybe because you
can want to talk about later but make why is it ethically flawed um because the subject about
whether there's free will at the end of the day isn't about neuroscience and isn't about philosophy
and isn't it it's about the fact that we've created a world that runs on a myth that it's just
and runs on a myth that it is ethically defendable to have a world in which
all sorts of people are rewarded for things they didn't earn and a vastly larger number of people
live lives of misery and deprivation and are viewed as having been entitled to it for things
they had no control over either okay yeah and we'll get you know sorry okay good okay um
it worked up about this one yeah well good well i can't wait if you're worked up about this yeah
well that's the part of the book where you can really sense the emotion and frustration
and yet also fear but that you're gonna say something that you know is that people are gonna
yeah anyway it's interesting i'm in the bravery it took to write it down i think you talked about
that you were hesitant you know one of the many there are lots of things that cause you to take
time in writing this book but but how people respond to the obvious consequences of what you're
saying is is terrifying a little bit i think i can understand that um you next talk about
where intent comes from where you really begin to get into the into for me the fascinating
aspects of neurobiology much of which i knew nothing about and so it was great learning experience
for me also depressing of course because every time you learn i mean it's driven home even things
that are the examples the explicit examples and empirical examples of things that i might have
presumed exist are are depressing like the fact that that when you make decisions about things
that you think are decisions that you say in three different studies subjects and brain
scanners alternated between rating the beauty of something or the goodness of the same behavior
and basically and you say both types of assessments activated the same region the orbital orbital
cortex or OFC the more beautiful or good the more OFC activation is as if a relevant emotions
about beauty gum up cerebral contemplation of the scales of justice namely you make decisions and
it's just explicit not just where we we know that but you can measure the brain and see
that it is that these that these external things which you shouldn't which you don't think are
affecting your rationality are are totally determining what you think is rational yep
and never in a million years with the average person who's just made one of those judgments
saying oh that's interesting why did you decide that oh it's because my orbital frontal cortex
evolved that it has trouble distinguishing between the two because it's very recently that we evolved
to making moral assessments rather than just like appearance assessments oh that's why I did that
yeah right exactly yeah and and and it's true we we as you point out that that we that these
moral assessments are recent so yeah all of the biological machinery was developed without that
and we've built up a a morality and a rationally again trying to impose that on on an infrastructure
that wasn't based on any of that once again if if Hume had been around today he would say
reason is a slave of passion it's I mean this gives me to that beautiful quote I mean which he
have presumed presumed I guess in on the basis of thinking about things but but not with the
evidence that you have and it's great to see evidence that specifically shows over and over again
that reason is a slave of passion well and you used a great word for describing all of the clues
of like oh it's just this mishmash that you kind of put together and improvised which is
the human brain another sound bite of the field evolution is not an inventor it's a tinkerer
okay what do we got here and we suddenly have like come up with a notion of love
worry okay give me some duct tape this part of the brain is going to have a lid even though
for a hundred million years it's been doing this instead so there's going to be some mistakes
yeah that's exactly it and and okay and then when you so you begin to in each of these cases
for the first when you talk about the the biological basis of trying to address this fallacy of free
will of perceived free will you you talk about you try and again put meat on turtles all the way
down but saying okay you have this intent what about the minutes before what about the hours
before what about the days before the millennia before the millions of years before and and I
want to you know unpack that a little bit you talk about you know pre-existing tendencies towards
aggression and and and and and how you say about all because of how much life has taught them at a
young age that the world is a menacing place that people or that animals in particular
that that experience the fact the world's aggressive is a menacing place
respond with the kind of aggression that you might have that's not surprising
that that they don't control that it's based on it's based on their experiences minutes hours
years or lifetimes or genetically beforehand yeah exactly one of the things that I was interested
in I want to throw these things in because there's so many neat examples is just to show a sense that
you know when we talk about being good people by being monogamous versus polygamous you talk
about different species and oxytocin and testosterone and and vasopressin receptor levels
and and why don't you talk about what happened I was going to quote it but you better you can
talk about polygamous rodent species versus monogamous rodent species and and and and I found
this fact once again fascinating when you think about this what we impose as a moral issue now
is a is a is is biology and biological yeah this is this is like irresistible and so much fun to
teach about voles voles are these little vol things that run around and there's all these different
types and there are mountain voles and prairie voles and the great american west and they turn
out despite like having 99 percent of the genes and common they have very very different social
systems in that prairie voles are monogamous they form pair bonds and mountain voles are
polygamous and I always have to remember when I'm teaching this okay which one is it garrison
keeler garrison keeler talks about the great like american values out and whoa but god stuff that's
in the prayer it's the prairie voles who are monogamous they turn out not to be but that's
that's what I always have to remember before I mess them up so wow how'd that happen because
they're so closely related they're so and incredibly cool work by like a bunch of neuroscientists
over the last couple of decades have completely unpacked that system when you are a male vol
of either species and you're mating you've released this hormone vasopressant from one
party or brain and what it does is it buzzes a party or brain having to do with reward and
whoa they just explain sex feels good and then it turns out that because of just a gene duplication
event a change in a promoter on a gene in other words stuff that like dead white males and lab
coats and molecular biology could explain in the prairie voles the receptor for vasopressant
is more widespread and responsive than the receptor in the mountain voles so for the same
sex act they get a whole lot more of a buzz and at that point like basic behaviorism takes over
wow that was great I think I'll stick around and instead mountain voles are nomadic the males there
and they're like gone the next day okay how do you know this how do you know this one of those
experiments where like people's mouths have to drop open brilliant like molecular manipulation
take the prairie vol version of this gene and plunk it down into mountain voles
and you make a monogamous you make a monogamous it's amazing yeah I mean that's the kind of thing
I love I mean you can't argue with that right that's what's great about it and okay so what about us
and what about us and aren't we monogamous but what about divorce rates and what about most
societies are polygamy you know and there's incredibly convincing evolutionary biology
showing that among all the primates we're right in the middle we're like halfway between being a
classic pair bonding monogamous species of the polygamous one and there's all sorts of interesting
ways you can show that but in terms of this say okay so which version what kind of vole are we
and it turns out we have different variants some of us have one kind some of us have one another
and that's predictive of things like how stable the relationships you form that's predictive of
things like how close you stand to an attractive person if you're already in a relationship
oh my god it's the same stuff it's like the same stuff that before it's over with is produced like
sonnets or divorce lawyers so there's very human specific aspects to it but whoa even that
is ultimately mechanistic yeah it's and and so the and and when we come to responsibility people
who are condemned for one way or another as you point out a lot of these things are gene variants
or affected by expression of genes epigenetics which I want to have you explain the first time I
really understood well I'm not sure I still understand but the first time I think I understood
it was reading your book I never could quite understand how but it's gene expression anyway
but but you you sum this up by saying thus the decisions you supposedly make freely in moments
that test your character like monogamy let's say generosity empathy honesty are influenced by the
levels of these hormones in your bloodstream and the levels of variance of the receptors in your
brain it's just that not character it's those it's that oh all that's like uh fidelity or
if you're in a different society all of the cultural values built around you should be fine
being the third wife or you should want to get as many camels as possible to get as many wives
and that's how we that's the kind of people we are and whether it's one extreme or the other
or one of the ones in between it's imbued with value and cultural judgment and that's not it
that said you know it's not all what version of the vasopressin receptor gene you have
and those studies showing that and different human correlates of it's not everyone's just
at a higher than expected rate all all of our usual provisos there but if you knew about
the vasopressin status plus three more than neurotransmitters and seven of the hormones and
this and that you're getting close to saying that's why this person is this way instead of that way
well again i think of dan denett again we're saying you know you it you can't you you may not be able to
feel good about your accompli you know feel you deserve the prizes and you and similarly you might
feeling that you've been a good person is is is great but um but you may also realize that it's a
genetic a bit of luck as well or all the other biology all of us yeah and historical genetic
historical in fact we'll talk about that i want to so that's so that's that's minutes to hours
you know hormonal uh influence on your actions which are immediate but then you talk about you
know weeks to years really related to neuroplasticity which i guess i i guess uh um um is becoming
increasingly important um and um and you say to jump to sort of depressing in a way to read once
again about adolescence and its importance because we don't of us can have control i mean when you
think about that that you're you're doomed you're doomed in some ways to act the way you are because
of the of some of a period in your life that you sometimes want to just forget um and you say
if you're an adult your adolescent experiences of trauma stimulation love failure rejection
happiness despair acne the whole shebang will have played an outsized role in constructing
the frontal cortex because you point out that's when it's being constructed um constructing
the frontal cortex you're working with as you contemplate pushing buttons of course the
enormous varieties of adolescent experiences will help produce enormously varied frontal
cortexes in adulthood boy isn't that depressing
yeah but you know from my perspective cool yeah the genetic mechanism for it
well you but you actually but in fact you point out even a better reason it's not depressing
in some sense it was a rhetorical question because i the next page you say this suggests
something remarkable the genetic program of the human brain evolved to free the frontal cortex
from genes as much as possible namely if if the frontal cortex is being developed during a period
of learning of experiences in a rational intelligent self-conscious species you'd want that brain
function which really is what's governing much of your rational behavior i guess to to be as free
from genes as possible to be based on experience so you you are you understand the world as it
in principle is as opposed to the world that your genetic ancestors might have experienced
yeah like basically we have evolved genetically more than any other species to be free of our
genes and free of their deterministic powers and that's that's what that's a great thing it's not
a bad thing it's allow it's allowed us to get where we are and and and necessary for us for people
for as complex a brain as we have probably well unless you spend your late adolescence
where you're listening to speeches every day by a guy with a mustache and a brown shirt and saying
here's who's responsible for problems in society yeah means formative stuff is happening then and
that could be for better or worse in fact for worse you point out that you talk about this a c e score
which is what's an adverse childhood experience score which i guess psychologists can can get
by looking at all sorts of neglect and household dysfunction and abuse and all of these categories
that you may or may not have experienced and you say for every step higher in one's a c e score
is roughly a 35 increase in the likelihood of adult antisocial behavior including violence
poor frontal cortical development cognition problems with impulse control substance abuse
teen pregnancy unsafe sex and other risky behaviors and increased vulnerable vulnerability to
depression and anxiety disorders oh and also poor health and earlier death so um you know that that
impact is is remarkable and and one might say how does that impact happen and that's where i may
be introducing us too early but that's this connection between genes and environmental
interactions which i think is related to epigenetics so do you want to explain i mean people
would say look how can this be the genes are genes you have a dna how can how can experience
it's almost sounds lamarckian how can how can experience experience is going to change that
chemistry of the of the dna backbone so what are you telling me what and so why do you why do you
get to get around that question and explain it better than i could yeah experience environment
all of that doesn't change your genes your genes that are made up a sequence of dna and a code and
it doesn't change your genes what experience does is change the on off switches for your genes
how readily you activated gene whether you permanently silence it how readily you activated
under this circumstance but not that circumstance what epigenetics is about is the regulation of
genes and it turns out when you look at a species like us the majority of our dna is not devoted to
the genes the majority is devoted to the regulatory elements the instruction manual is much longer than
the dna code itself and what evolution is mostly about if you want to get into a nuts and bolts
level is the evolution of the regulatory control far more than the genes themselves
and what environment does is forever after in some cases in some cases even multi-generationally
make it easier or harder to activate certain genes yeah in fact you say that what it comes
to humans it can be silly to ask what a gene does which is the kind of thing my elementary
biology might have asked because i don't know much um but not you shouldn't ask what that does
but what it does in a particular environment because it's the turning it's the expression it's
it's the turning on and off the genes produce proteins that give instructions for production
proteins and and how when that gets turned on and off and my also understanding of how
impactful those proteins are in subsequent things is also environmentally related
because some of those proteins are switches that turn genes on or off yeah sorry you're
regulating the regulators and it's regulators all the way down it's these recursive loops
yeah okay i mean and and that's i think incredibly important to realize that that that's how
when one thinks of there there's i guess you know you can say okay the luck there's lucky genes
as people say born with lucky genes but when we talk about the spectrum of behaviors for which
we think we have free wellness spectrum of people and for which we'll have to take responsibility
for good or bad actions you could say well there are two there are two components there's gene variants
the population has gene variants and some people do have lucky genes and some people have unlucky
genes in the sense of getting a variant that you know related to vassals pressin or whatever
and then there's the other aspect which i really hadn't fully appreciated is exactly
how the environment affects the the mechanism by which environment affects gene regulation
is the other aspect so there's there's the there's the variants in genes and their variants in
environmental experiences and it's that combination of those two that determines who you are
neither of which you had any say in nine of which you had any say in yeah exactly you didn't even
get to fill out an application form yeah and uh and uh just like you yeah in particular we all
realized we didn't have any say in the choice of our parents and sometimes that's good and sometimes
bad i mean and and but it goes far beyond that um now you say okay that's okay so that's basic
biology but beyond that we go back more than just years and more just more than just your own life
experience but the life experience of your ancestors culture that which that you'll be
irresistible it's totally cool uh it's totally cool um i'm a dilatant in this area because
what do i know from like cultural anthropology or history or stuff but different cultures are
different duh uh and there are historically and biologically and ecologically logical reasons
why different cultures wind up in different ways for example like way back when traditional means
of production you could be a farmer or you could be a hunter-gatherer or you could be a pastoralist
and it turns out that pastoralists all the world over whether it's yaks or camels or goats or whatever
are much higher than likely to generate what is called a culture of honor where it's built around
retribution revenge clan loyalties feuds that go for centuries where it involves forming warrior
classes high rates of aggression all that sort of thing and whoa you hardly ever see that among
the farmers or the hunter-gatherers and what's that about um if the bad people come and you're a
hunter-gatherer they can't steal your rainforest if they come to your farm they can't steal all your
they can't harvest your crops at night but sneaky low-down varmints can come and rustle your cattle
at night. Pastoralists spend all their time raiding each other and stealing their means of
livestock and like in Africa I hang out near a pastoralist tribe and like they have raids on
each other and steal all the cows and people have to take revenge and all of that. Among
pastoralists you have a special vulnerability in being nomadic and in your wealth being a bunch of
animals that could be stolen and they all evolved these similar cultures of honor and where if you
do not answer an insult to your honor with twice the retaliation you're just like losing face and
you're dishonoring you and your family and your ancestors and your people and all of that and that
turns out to explain aspects geographical variations and violence on this planet or as another one
another one people whose ancestors or people who live in rainforests are much more likely than
chance to invent polytheistic religions people who live in deserts are more likely to invent
monotheistic ones and there's all sorts of ecological you know if you're living in a forest
where there's like a thousand different edible plants that you can use it's not that surprising
that you decide that there's like a spirit inside each one of those different plants and like a thousand
flowers blooming and like if you're living in the desert everything gets boiled down to just like
survival and very singular things and big surprise they come up with singular religions and you know
people like Jared Diamond have done brilliant work analyzing how it is that this planet was
overrun by the desert monotheists rather than the rainforest polytheists and that's the planet we
have now but that's a cultural difference and that one influences like from shortly after birth
where you were being taught like ethics come from and who you were trying to please and
whose foot or whose plural feet you'll be sitting at if you do things right and wind up in the
in paradise afterward and that's from culture and I never understood that what what I think is
important is is that relates to what we're just talking about in a way that I hadn't really appreciate
for I knew the call obviously culture reflects people and you know when I talk to people you
know they don't seem to get when I talk about religion isn't it surprising that the children
of Christians turn out to be Christian the children of Muslims turn out to be Muslim
and if there's some universal truth isn't that a little surprising of course it's a cultural thing
but now you when you talk about say the pastoralists and sort of retribution and violence
now I kind of now I'm thinking biochemically or neurobiologically so that experience undoubtedly
affects the regulation of genes that produce aggressive responses so you can understand the
how that culture ends up affecting people whose whose DNA is the same but but but but but the
regulation of that DNA is culturally determined in some sense and like from a cultural perspective
the job of parents is to make kids who will have the same cultural values as them and translated
that into neurobiology is to have their nervous systems constructed in a way that this is what
they will carry along okay here's here's like one of the all-time cool experiments and it's the only
time I have seen a particular word appear in a scientific journal this was incredible work
by this guy Richard Nesbitt University in Michigan one of the gods of social psychology and what it
was one of those where the psych majors like come volunteer for this experiment and I got to ask
questions about whatever and so they go to the psych department and there's the lab they're
going to down to the end of the hall and they walk down the hall from the elevator and unbeknownst
to them the experiment occurs in the hallway which is it's a narrow hallway all these like
shelves and junk and stuff and as they're walking down there's a guy walking at you he's a
big beefy guy who's working on the project and what he does is as he comes past you he knocks
into your shoulder looks back and says watch it asshole this is the experiment in print and then
what they do is they like you come into the lab and they give you all sorts of scenarios of like
moral quandaries and what would you do in response to this and what you see is people from the north
northern united states having been bumped into has no effect on their answers and of course
there's the controls where the guy doesn't do that to you and people from the south were now far more
likely if they were bumped into the knot to advocate violent responses to these norm violation
scenarios and they elevate their levels of testosterone and stress hormones whoa are you
kidding the american south instead of being settled by these nice like quaker shopkeepers
were settled by these like crazy-ass irish scotsman shepherds and stuff and they brought a culture of
honor and centuries later you're walking down a hallway in an arbor in michigan and that's going
to influence how much stress hormones you secrete and whether you advocate saying
you know they're just an idiot but ignore them versus rip their throat out wow this
ultra stuff persists wow yeah it's just yeah wow i love these examples i'm i'm that's i'm really
happy with it's amazing because you could put meat on all of these you know the words sound nice
but the meat is what matters i mean that's what makes it science and uh and we talk about you
know i wrote down education here because you talked about the purpose of parents in some sense
is to inculcate those values and the cultural things to their children which is by the way the
reason i argue that for public education the purpose of education is to get you away from your
parents in my opinion which i could never understand why in the u.s we have this system where parents
somehow are supposed to be able to impact on the elevate education of children because that's
and why i like why i'm not always a big fan of homeschooling because it seems to me that's the
great opportunity is to get people away to learn that the world isn't exactly necessarily the way
their parents say it is yep exactly except you know it's not by chance that the school that your
parents are going to send you to um is going to teach some semblance of their exact same values
you're not going to go to a school if you're growing up in cancass and they teach you that
it is time for the workers of the world to unite and overthrow their chains and you're not going to
go to a school and i'm chotka and they yeah yes the parents still get in there well okay so so this
so this we basically i don't know whether we beat in a dead horse but we certainly added a lot of
color to it um and and and the part of the book about intent you basically say to summarize in
order to prove this free will we have to show that some behavior just happened out of thin air
in the sense of considering all of these biological precursors the ones we've talked about in a lot
more obviously in the book it may be possible to sidestep that with some subtle philosophical
arguments but you can't with anything known to science and i think that's the sort of the key
thing but then when we come to then then when we come to the padding of the on the back um the
question is you know people um you know surely with with grit and hard work you can overcome
you know the the bad luck of your existence and um and the and the idea is that it is that
is a misunderstanding of history which i think you basically say look okay these people are saying
okay there's no free will i accept everything you said about hormones and everything so clearly
there's no free will in what you're doing now but somehow in the past the past you there was
something you could have done that you know to make yourself a better person now and somehow
that that it's okay it's somehow we can bury the free will in the past you want to elaborate on that
or if you're a particularly fancy compatibilist somehow in the future which somehow counts in
the present or whatever it's a notion of like what brought you to this moment and the answer
rather than being because of what happened a second ago and a minute ago and an hour and
a million years ago in biology all the way it's because of the key decisions you made back when
which is just like oh good they've just explained it by saying the puzzle is now on back when
that's that's what we're now trying to explain and the trouble is whatever was in the past
once was now and why did this behavior just happen because of one second before one minute
before etc etc it's it's this it's one of the like dodges in there i mean what you're bringing up also
is this totally seductive dichotomy which is like one compatibilist trick which
most people advocate is that you'll say okay okay there's some stuff we had no control over
like i don't have a voice that could sing opera i'm not tall enough to play in the mba i don't have
whatever receptor for whatever neurotransmitter so that i've got this amazing analytical skills
whatever yeah yeah yeah we have our natural attributes and those are biological yeah what
isn't what really matters is what do you do with those attributes do you put your shoulder to the
grindstone do you squander your gifts do you do you like get going when the going gets tough to
and that's where we've got this incredibly sort of Judeo-Christian
temptation to say that that is the playground of free will and judgment it's what we do with
what we were gifted or cursed that's the measure of a person and that's so destructive i mean
like it's got a nice nabby-pandy liberal version of it which is when your kid does something good
don't tell them oh you must be so smart say oh you must work so hard because you're fueling that side
of the dichotomy and and that's a good thing because that is instrumental value not because
it has moral value but it's this huge dichotomy that the natural attributes we have are made out of
atoms and whether you show backbone in a moment of temptation that's the stuff that's made out of
the fairy dust and the what you do with what you got what you do with those crossroads and splits
in the road and all those things is made of the same stuff because it's that frontal cortex of
viewers that decides are you going to show impulse control or are you going to do long-term planning
or you do and it's the exact same how did you get the frontal cortex that you have because of one
second ago and one minute ago and all of that and that's why at some point somebody is going to
decide to rob the liquor store and instead somebody is going to decide to devote their life to doctors
without borders or something exactly the the point that somehow accepting that the instantaneous
moment of what you're you know that your that your local intent to that moment
is biological control but somehow what determined your local intent which was earlier
isn't biologically determined it's that it's that irrationality I had you know you do give a you know
to pick again on dead horse you pick on dead you know but basically he says that he says so you
know when someone when he argued with someone that we have no control over the biology or the
environment thrown at us then his response was so what the point I think you're missing is that our
autonomy is something one grows into it's a it's a process that's initially entirely beyond one's
control but back when it was happening it was the same biology so it wasn't anymore and and and
as one matures one learns one's being able to control more and more one's activities but the
whole point is you just learned that you don't control I mean you you don't control them you
you know you you control them but your control over that of the of that was determined because
was was once is yeah exactly was was once is it's so clear when one puts it that way
I guess I I don't I don't see it I think the fundamental question and as a physicist this
is why as a physicist I I guess I never have found this whole issue it seemed to be clear
is it fundamentally everything
everything is determined by a combination of of nature which is biology physics and chemistry
and none of those have fairy dust in them not even physics we'll get to it
and and once you recognize that then then it's clear that that that that free will
must be an illusion because because none of those none of those none the the the physics and
chemistry I know the physics I know the chemistry a little bit in the biology less all of them behave
with rules of science that don't allow for that you know that gap in that Sydney Karris cartoon
yeah exactly and an awful lot of people work very very hard and begin to have almost evangelical
incoherence at points where they still manage to pull that out of the hat there's still a
special essence that doesn't obey those rules well it's it's to me it's very related again
having spent a lot of time thinking recently about consciousness to the same argument
as where is the you that exists beyond your brain I mean it's the same really argument
isn't it in some sense it's a where can that be if you know that this is what there is
so where's the you if it's not there and and and if it's beyond there then somehow you're
invoking some fairy dust to assume that that you as an independent existence
and the version of that that like makes us wet our pants the most is so when someone dies
there's no them anymore yeah yeah like that's that's enough to make almost anyone who rejects free
will feel a little bit like queasy and dizzy at that point uh but yeah yeah well and and my you
have heard this my argument and people always say what happened to it and and the argument which I
didn't invent myself but first was told to me you know what was it like before you're born
just imagine what it was like before you're born and then but okay let's talk about them
but you are here and and you spend some time on the cognitive prefrontal cortex which is so
important to learning and socialization and sociality and how those things are are you know
evolved and um you talk about the social pfc the the um that um that basically there's two
the prefrontal cortex is sort of control mech I don't know whether you want to think of it as a
control mechanism but it does two things right it it kind of inhibits it either it either encourages
or inhibits and in the right quote unquote right moment so you want to discuss that a little bit
I guess I guess the key thing I learned about from your is this two parts of the pfc and I love
saying these things because they make me sound so literate biologically now and I forget the words
almost immediate that's why I didn't become biologist early on as I couldn't memorize words
I was awful at it but there's the dorsolateral pfc and then there's the ventromedial pfc and there's
sort of the the yin and yang the devil the devil and the angel on the side of you why don't you talk
about that and and by the way I probably didn't become a physicist because I couldn't understand
the concepts so you couldn't you couldn't memorize the jargon but oh well well whatever yeah it was
just okay you could have if you wanted to anyway the lateral let's call it the eggheady part of your
prefrontal cortex and the ventromedial your emotional over the top like hysterical part
ventromedial prefrontal cortex is the means by which the more emotional parts of your brain
the olympic system funnel all of their opinions and quirks and yearnings and legitimate aspirations
and stuff and send that information on to the frontal cortex that's how your frontal cortex
is figuring out what your gut is telling you what biases are about to make you make a totally
unfair decision you're it's the ways in which decision making is is influenced by emotion
and that's been a major revolution for the field of figuring out no it's not just your like gleaming
calculator of a prefrontal cortex that's telling the limbic system now's the time to give the
person flowers now's not the time to do whatever because you're going to regret it that there's
as much flow of information from the emotional part of the brain to this eggheady part of the brain
so the ventromedial the emotional part of the prefrontal cortex is getting that information
and amid lots of other areas of the brain there that fumfer around and confer and compare and
contrast and whatever it's ultimately the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex that's the decider
that sends out a message that is four or five steps away from your muscles that sends out a
message that's four or five steps away from telling your muscles not to do that raising issues of
free won't as well as free will and these two areas of the brain are like very pertinent to this
big surprise the cortex was the last part of the brain to fully evolve evolutionarily
the prefrontal cortex was the last part of the cortex to evolve the dorsal lateral prefrontal
cortex was the last part of the prefrontal cortex to evolve and we proportionately have
more of it than any other species out there so that's where your calvinistic backbone dwells
or your your turpitude or whatever and it's the same thing what kind of dorsal lateral prefrontal
cortex do you have today it depends it depends on what happened the second ago and a million years
ago and all of that because stress and stimulation and certain gene variants and the levels of this
hormone and the levels of that nutrients and certain cultural more produce different kinds
of dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices and this is not just oh this is this has to be the case from
work like go do imaging and look at the size of these in different people and it reflects all
sorts of logical stuff people who were much better at like doing the right thing when it's the harder
thing to do you go and look and they have a bigger and or a more energetic dorsal lateral
prefrontal cortex than other people damage the prefrontal cortex and you get somebody who can
even sit there and tell you the difference between right and wrong and nonetheless at every juncture
they're going to do the impulsive disastrous thing and just to kind of stop you in your tracks
depending on the study 25 to 75 percent of the men in this country on death row have a history
of concussive head trauma to that part of the brain uh we're talking machines here we're not
talking souls yeah well that's right and and and why that's that's power that's amazingly powerful
speaking of the pfc and the experience that you've had it there was it there's a there was a quote
here that made me think well a lot of course made me think you see all the individual pieces of these
findings follow so socio socioeconomic status predicts how much a young child's
d l pfc which is that whatever it's called um yeah yeah yeah it activates and recruits other
brain regions during an executive task it predicts more responsiveness of the amygdala to physical
um or social threats a stronger activation signal carrying this emotional response to the pfc
by the vm pfc which is the other the emotional part of the pfc i guess and such status predicts
every possible measure um of function and kids uh named naturally lower socioeconomic status predicts
worst pfc development this this does smack when a buzzword now it's called white privilege which
i have which i which is over well which i have issues with at some level but but we won't go
there but but this does suggest i mean there is privilege and and and and it's and it's undeniable
what it doesn't suggest is that somehow it you know it suggests the world isn't fair but it
doesn't say that you can cure that by then doing something else because it just says you know you're
stuck with with the with the with your with the experience of your past and suddenly you know
society doing these other things is not necessarily going to solve your particular problems uh huh
here here is where i have to disagree strongly okay good because as it's turning out very little
in your brain is irreversible um that's this whole field of neuroplasticity yes and when you
look at how change occurs an incredibly dramatic change and explanations for why one out of every
10 or 100 000 of kids who grow up in some appalling circumstance wind up not having that profile and
blah blah all of that um change happens massive amounts of change can happen and when you look
at how that works it's exactly as mechanistic as everything else that reinforces the belief that
we don't have free will rather than doing exactly the opposite no in fact i yeah we're
not in agreement because i guess what i wanted to say is that appropriately in fact that's
my out at the last part of this book i'm going to argue that that appropriately treating the world
as if we have free will understanding that we don't have free will will allow the kind of positive
change that one that is that that is necessary even personal positive change right we'll get there
the possibility of change and how you do it can only be effectively done when you understand
the mechanisms that imply we don't have free will if you want to understand how how to affect you
you know we talk about we don't have the ability to determine what we wish in some ways but we can
but with that knowledge we can we can i think allow future development that may change what we
wish so we'll we'll get there and i think that's really important but but i guess what i was saying
is that some of the societal solutions that are proposed
there's inequities and they're built in inequities in the world and that's and you're
right we should be trying to address those in a realistic way and and a realistic way means
thinking about the science and not and not thinking about airy fairy wonderful imaginary
solutions i guess that's that's that's my let alone nationalistic myths of equal opportunity
yeah exactly you got it anyway so that so i think that the i love your summary
part of basically the takeaway is that it's impossible to successfully exactly this is what
i was going to i was good for this quote was right in front of me it's impossible to successfully
wish what you're going to wish for this chapter's punchline is that it's impossible to successfully
will yourself to have more willpower and that it it isn't a great idea to run the world on the
belief that people can and should i and that's important but i want to come back to that because
i think that does leave this will this loophole that while you can't successfully will yourself to
have more willpower what you can do is potentially with that knowledge and the recognition that people
can learn and change you can imagine ways to in the future adjust yourself to have characteristics
that you might prefer to have and exactly that's really important but you can only do it if you
realize the real science behind it which is that it's not you don't do it by just strength of
character you do it by thinking of the kind of things that change people for better or worse
and and and so i think that's really important and if in addition to that you're lucky enough
to wind up in life where you can listen to a lecture yeah exactly that's the whole point
i mean learning actually works otherwise you and if we didn't think that i don't think you and i
would have been doing what we well we might have anyway but uh but um but we you know it's that
a hawk experience in fact somewhere in the book you say how difficult the stating is to find something
you fundamentally believe in is wrong and i've always said i found it the most energizing thing
in the world i hope everyone my my goal in higher education is that every student has something
that they fundamentally believe is central to their being proved to be wrong and that's the
purpose of education i think because it opens your mind well i think as i said before you're
made of more resilient stuff than me so good go maybe yeah well yeah what maybe in that aspect
but i'm i'm still i still feel i still envy all the other aspects of you anyway um and and i find
them remarkable in ways i always find when people do things that i couldn't think of even doing in
principle how and and you're full of that but anyway let's and we've already okay enough of that
okay i want to get to chaos and determinism and then i want to get to the to the to sort of the
emotional heart of this which is which is responsibility in the second half of your book
but so you the argument look it comes down to this okay people say yeah yeah all that sort
but nature has these weird characteristics and one is chaos that the world is chaotic and and
unpredictable and um um and and that's there's the out there's the magic there's the magic out
because the world is unpredictable either because when you never have more than two bodies and as
you described nicely here um uh you have you have chaotic systems you can't you can't you
can't predict the future of a three-body system which is amazing when you think about it it just
the first time i learned that was amazing and i will give a plug by the way i um um uh timothy
palmer wrote a book called um something something something of doubt which i just actually we had
a he's a physicist he's a climatologist it's a great book on chaos and and and and and understanding
its implications for not just not just climate science but behavior and all sorts of other things
i highly recommend you take a look at it i don't know if you saw it but in some recent issue of
science or nature there was a paper entitled something like a statistical solution to the
three-body problem which of course i immediately turned the page because i was not going to understand
a word of it i assume it really has not solved the three-body problem statistically well yeah i mean
but i mean a statistical solution is chaos especially if they're if they're if they're you
know strange attractor you can ask what's the likelihood of the system is going to end
which is what meteorology is all about what's the likelihood that and and you do that by running
computer simulations many times over and you see where it goes because you can't a priori do it you
change the initial conditions and anyway um but chaos implies and you you go into this that that
that that for many systems small changes extremely small changes and initial conditions
can produce dramatic changes in outcomes can don't don't always not don't must but can
and that's an important thing too they don't always but they can and that seems to be suggested
somehow there's this there's this out and um and and i think i don't know what you say here but
basically i paraphrase this thing not being able to so this is an anti-reductionist argument and
and as a as a reductionist it's always amusing to me to see the anti-reductionism as someone who's
tried to understand the fundamental structure of matter it's always amusing um because although
all year later um emergent complexity i think is reductionism in a different form but but um
not being able to trace things to their fundamental constituents not being able to go back to the
fundamental constituents to be able to say how a system is going to behave is not an out
you want and let me let me let you give your explanation and then i want to add something
to it from physics oh good um because every single person who says
chaoticism is totally cool and unexpected and revolutionary is completely right and every one
of them who then says and this is where you could find free will is wrong because they always make
the same mistake they think that systems that are unpredictable are undeterministic
and that's the get out of free get out of jail free card that they think they're pulling out of
that point and there's a universe of differences between determinism and predictability chaotic
systems which occur in like molecules and cells and brains and societies and universes chaotic
systems are deterministic or is that deterministic is the most like old-time clock with gears
but because of the nature of the interactions going on are not predictable and unpredictable does
not mean you can pull free will out of that that's the key point you make and i think very important
is that unpredictable is not not deterministic they the three-body system is this is it is governed
by newton's laws there's nothing more predictable than that they're the same things that made the
world ended the burning of witches when made it seem like the world was comprehensible by
mathematics and and and and causes had effects and and effects had causes uh
yeah but but they're unpredictable but let me add for for your ammunition as i was thinking about this
it occurred to me the exact this almost the strongest version i can think of this is thermodynamics
because there i can't predict there's no way i can predict where the atoms in this room are or
what that you know for many reasons there's no way but there's nothing stronger than the second
law of thermodynamics okay which says even it's all totally unpredictable but it's but it governs
the world there's a law that you can't break and every time people try and do it they create
perpetual motion machines because they try and avoid the second law of thermodynamics
and much of life is trying to avoid it when i look at my study every day it's trying to avoid it
and and yet there's nothing more there's nothing stronger that got nothing more deterministic
than the second law of thermodynamics yet it's based on the fact that i it's based on the fact
that i'm i have a system that's at a fundamental large-scale level unpredictable
never going to be able to say exactly where it's going to be puffing out but by definition
if you've just climbed up a mountain the bag of potato chips you brought with you were going to be
like bulging outward yeah yeah exactly and it's it's uh it's incredibly important that that that that
that uh that we that it's it's the basis of the world we live in we physics works for a world
that's chaotic and unpredictable because because it is deterministic because there are certain
things you can say with certainty and the one of them is that a closed system in a closed system
the entropy of that system is going to either remain the same or increase uh and and and and so
and that's deterministic that's a rule that's a law and a law that can't be violated in spite
of the unpredictability of the specifics of that system and and that's why i guess where i come from
in physics so okay for the first time in my life i'm going to start using the word thermodynamics
great that's exactly oh good yeah exactly now and you can and it's just like i'm going to say
i'm going to remember that dorsal lateral or whatever pfc make myself sound good too okay um
one well come to i want i want to jump ahead because you point out that we have developed okay
so that in 1922 um people would have said that you know someone would be in shoplifting
um you know and urinating in public behaved a certain way because he chose to in 2022 we now
say they behave that way because of deterministic mutations of one gene in in this particular
example and you point out that that um so in in if if that i forget what you say but if if free
well is determined by what we know by level of ignorance there's something wrong if an instance
of free will exists only until there's a decrease in our ignorance so it's free will until we
understand it and then it's not free will anymore and and as i say that's exactly the god of the
gaps argument exactly you know thunderstorms are god and then we understand thunderstorms and where
it's a room left for god you it's it's not even theologians understand it's not a good argument
for trying to put god there because that shrinks and i don't understand why the free will people
don't realize that shrinks each time we learn more about how systems work um yes emergent complexity
is interesting because um the argument and and and and and i've you know i've seen in in physics
there's this debate because these people say oh well you know particle physics here these fundamental
is okay but really the really interesting stuff is the stuff that you can't explain at this
reductionistic level it's all the fascinating structures it's how meal boils it's it's it's
and and and that and you know and and there are things you you know obviously the understanding
things at a microscopic level don't necessarily help you understand and there's lots of
and you give examples of emergent complexity in particular in neuronal systems um and um but
but it's again it's not clear why that that um
that reflects anything the fact that you can't trace the end result from fundamental constituents
is once again uh ignoring the fact that that that unpredictability is not the same as indeterminacy
and um and evolution itself in some sense it seems to me when i when i was reading it
some thoughts occurred and i wanted to run them by you
i mean you know it's no great mystery i mean snowflakes are in some sense emergent complexity
you take the fundamental polar interactions molecules and who would have thought they'd
form these beautiful christmas-like patterns but but more than that um uh evolution itself in some
sense is a because you point out that the whole point of of of emergent complexity is that the
individual constituents are just doing their own little thing without knowing what the whole system
is doing and somehow the whole system goes in a certain direction and that's a remarkable statement
but okay so what um and you know but i don't you i wanted to ask you don't you see i mean i see
evolution is exactly that biological systems evolve not because they're some they're heading
in some direction or because globally something's happening it's because the individual system
sort of might be a genetic mutation and near neighbor-nearest neighbor interactions
reproduction and other things are going to drive the system in a way that may
you know in response to natural selection will will create an organism that has
beautifully structured existence to make it look like they were designed
exactly and that's totally cool and amazing and emergent complexity makes me so happy i
can't even begin to tell you that and it's the greatest of all of that but this is not a playground
either where suddenly you can pull free will out of it because once again it's built around the
confusion of predictability and determinism and the people who try to sidestep it and still somehow
get free will out of it always do the same trick that their model requires once you've established
an emergent level of something unexpected that emergent level can reach down and change the
constituent parts and if and only if there's 10 000 ants and they have formed like a complex
society like each individual ant now can like solve the traveling salesman problem on a piece of
paper no the whole point of emergent complexity is that the stupid simple little building blocks
are still just as stupid and simple but because there's enough of them out of it has come something
amazing and complex and adaptive but in order to pretend you've pulled free will out of it
you've got to assume the system works in a way that it can't that it doesn't
exactly okay and now let me throw something out at you which i only realized in the context of
reading that description of yours which i'm going to use now whenever i hear people throw
emergent complexity at me that emergent complexity is an extreme form of reductionism
because emergent complexity is just saying right right reductionism is saying the world
the complicated world is based on simple principles a few quarks four forces put them
together and look what happens emergent complexity is saying exactly the same thing
the fundamental constituents aren't knowledgeable about the whole world they're not complex
they're very simple they have a few simple behaviors a few simple properties that are
restricted to and out of that simplicity comes this amazing complexity so it's the ultimate force
it's the ultimate form of reductionism it seems to me exactly and the only reason
and its reductionism which when you put enough pieces together becomes unpredictable but you
haven't like escaped from the laws of reductionism and the only reason why emergent complexity is
interesting separate of uh because sometimes it's really surprising and beautiful is that's
understanding some phenomena it makes more sense to try to get it at that level than at the more
reductive level it's just more convenient yeah exactly and but physics is also based on that
i i most people i've written about in one of my books most people don't realize physics does
exactly that the law there's no the laws of physics are not there's no law of physics is universal
so you you discuss the laws that are appropriate to the scale at which you're exploring phenomena
and that's a that was a revolution in our thinking about physics and we actually have
the mathematical underpinning of that something called the neuronal renormalization group it
doesn't matter but that that that it's appropriate if if you're you know if you're if you're a
psychologist if you're a behavior psychologist or neuroscience it's ridiculous to try thinking about
quark interactions it's not going to get you anywhere um and so and but the same is true in
physics it's not a new phenomena that that you talk about the the appropriate interactions at the
scale at which you're looking at and that's just another you know and you do that because you
eventually want to finish your thesis and get a degree exactly that's like the most accessible
level yeah you want to yeah you want to do you want to exactly you want to get results
and then that's what science is all about find a way to get results that work and that and that
you can test and um nothing more fundamental than that um but you point out I mean this this thing
you just said that some level you have to reach down in order to find that miracle in order to
find that way yet the the emerging complex system is to reach down and change the properties of the
fundamental constituents but neurons are still neurons independent of what whatever and the
mechanisms neurons are going to change no matter how complex the system there's in
their fundamental interactions are going to be the same and I I can't help but say this there's
a whole chapter based on this and it seems to me you must be doing it because that's where all the
philosophers are hanging their hats without saying it somehow they're all saying just that
without having without explicitly saying it because when you explicitly say it it sounds
ridiculous and and I can't help but think you must have for much of your life had to
counter those philosophers or or at least hear those philosophical arguments um that's
really seductive um and that's what it pivots around and like I I stole this metaphor from
someone ooh an emergent feature of water molecules is water molecules are not wet until
there's a whole lot of them that's an immersion property however water is made of two hydrants
and one oxygen it's not the case that once things get wet it's sustained because it's now two
oxygens and one hydrogen yeah that's great that's great okay we will now move to quantum mechanics
but you'll be happy to know we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna gloss over it for many reasons
because I think it's a red herring in the first place um and you point out how it's a red herring
for for biological reasons which I'm aware of and I I had a big debate once on stage with
Mr. Hamarov about this but um but yeah I know it's where I explained you know the slightest
understanding what quantum mechanics was all about but um but the idea is people say look
quantum mechanics is indeterminate because it it has a fundamental indeterminacy that you perform
an experiment and the results are probabilistic you can't say with certainty in some cases you
can but in many cases you can't say with certainty what the result you can only say probabilistically
what the result of an experimental be and suddenly that fundamental indeterminacy appears to give you
a way out um let's give your arguments for why that's irrelevant which is basically two I think
I want to summarize them one that um that randomness is not a is not a good explanation of free will
and two that when you actually think of the mechanics of the brain the scale at which
quantum mechanical effects might come about which is something I've recognized too but
that the scale at which they might be relevant is vastly different than the scale it's going to be
cause an activation potential to or a whole slew of things to happen to make a decision
they're vastly different scales so why don't you elaborate for a second and then I'll say explain
why I don't think any of that matters anyway um because I I had never heard this phrase before
before starting to read about this stuff the brain is a moist noisy environment yes which
was very picturesque to me and kind of like unsettling and a little bit yucky but I guess
like for stuff at the quantum level to have any hope and hope in this case comes with like 23
zeros after it any hope of being able to impact macro events it requires a
synchrony it requires all of these random events to be random and roughly the same way all at once
and it can't work that way statistically and it especially can't work that way in moist noisy
environments like biological stuff because what they're very good at is collapsing
sort of the indeterministic features yeah the claps away for yeah I mean that's the
arguments that are presented that those words are are problematic but the but the idea is exactly that
that you know I face it because people talk to me well well look at all this quantum entanglement
and quantum teleportation when we will be able to send people from here there I would book a
Star Trek as you know and and and and the point is the only reason we can do that is we have to
it is quantum mechanics is so weird it because we don't experience it we don't experience it because
we don't we're not quantum we're we're we're classical beings and we are exist at a level
where the quantum mechanical aspect reality is hidden it's an amazing thing that we humans
even discovered that it's there that that in order to illustrate these quantum mechanical
things you have to very carefully prepare systems and unbelievably carefully prepare
systems that's why Nobel prizes are given out for these things it's hard to do so that you get
so that you can isolate the weirdness of quantum mechanics otherwise it's not there if it was
quantum mechanics wouldn't seem so strange but it's it's it's not there because you know you
can't teleport a human because a human isn't a very carefully prepared state of two photons where
you work very hard and you ins isolate it from the environment all the time it's happening so
there are no further interactions which destroy quantum correlations and all of the rest and
I mean it is surprising that there are in biological systems places where
quantum coherence exists where you wouldn't have expected it to you know maybe in photosynthesis
for example but but that's different than than brain function which is incredibly noisy environment
and not just noisy but the scale over which quantum fluctuations even if they can happen could happen
is vastly different than the scale where the important things related to neuronal processes
and activation potentials and decisions and are made okay so that's I think that's
really important but the but the but the thing I want to stress to you is quantum mechanics
isn't indeterminate so that whole argument is wrong in the first place people get it wrong
quantum mechanics is determinate quantum mechanics is based on a second order differential equation
Schrodinger equation second order different equation says if you give me the initial and it's
a second order differential equation for the wave function not for an observable but it says you
define it here and for all just like Newton just like the three-body problem for all future times
I can calculate exactly with a hundred percent certainty what the wave function is going to do
at least in principle in practice I might not be able to it's an incredibly it's completely
deterministic now it is true that when you try and make measurements those are probabilistic but the
underlying mechanism of quantum mechanics is completely deterministic and so the fact that
the results results are probabilistic is is just a red herring and the example I would give you
I think which I think is you know so people say oh maybe there's some accidental activation here
that changes your view here and that that gives you an out because of quantum mechanics the the
example that I think is really important is radioactivity radioactivity happens because of
quantum mechanics so I can't tell you when a given uranium atom is going to decay but I can tell you
with exact certainty that the laws of nature is determined that when what the behavior of the
radioactive system is going to be and how many of the I can't tell you which one but I can tell you
with certainty you know if it's big enough system exactly how many and they're going to be decaying
at any instant and so while it appears as if you have that indeterminacy it's it's really a it's
really a red herring the system is determined as in in large scale as anything else and radioactivity
is a is a perfect example if a radioact if uranium atoms you put a bunch of them together
are going to have a well-known decay rate the same is going to be true for for neurons in your
brain or anything else it's going to they're just as prescribed so I would if if you had told me that
I would not have had to affect my way through writing two chapters on it no but on the other
hand it's good the fact you were forced to do it is useful because then you were able to discuss
the things you know which is the processes in the brain and illustrate those which I can't do
illustrate exactly how how implausible even if it were true how the the processes that
determine free will in your brain aren't going to be affected by quantum mechanics and and anyway
well we're now going to talk we're going to now spend the last half hour or so talking about the
last half of your book it's really not the last half it's so I feel better it's like the last third
and which I which I which gave me solace when I realized how much I had left to read when I
when I when I before I got to the end the the the you know question of what we do about this but
but part so so given that given that it's undeniable that the that the world that we don't have free
well based on science so there's no loopholes there's no places for the magic to occur
why do we have the illusion of free will and why is that a good thing you ask about at the very
beginning of this and and and it seems to me yeah all right you have mentioned too it's there's an
obvious reasons right because because it allows us to function effectively the illusion of free
will allows us to go about whether we're early hominids or not to go about living the life
creating the illusions allow us to live our daily lives and evolution therefore
picks us we don't have the choice we don't have the choice to not believe in free will
if we want to be
psychiatrically resilient one of my favorite definitions of clinical depression is
it's a pathological failure of the ability to rationalize away reality that's great oh I like
that yeah absolutely and it and and and here's the point when I say we have no choice we have a
well we don't have a choice but we can be we can learn intellectually we can learn every time I'm
going to say I have a choice I'm going to say we can learn if we have exposed to the right teachers
of the right time in the right place we can learn intellectually that free will doesn't exist you
and I can learn that but that does not mean that we emotionally since reason is a slave of passion
that in our daily lives we don't go about our daily lives every day but because we're we're
you know we function funk well enough to be integrated in society that we don't go around
behaving like everyone else like we're making choices and we're and and and we're doing that so
it's so but it's the same as saying you know the fact that evolution requires us in some sense to
believe in if you will it's the same as saying well evolution may you know in principle suggests
you know it's okay to you know kill your neighbor under certain conditions but we do have learning
that allows us to override at least intellectually override that that fundamental evolutionary
remnant so so so so I think the second half of your book in large sense is about how we
understand override and utilize it to make a world which isn't bad it may seem like it's bad
and and and and so if I go to
so you know you summarize basically saying yeah well I don't think we need to summarize anymore
biological turtles all the way down but what do we do with that and the first question is
you know will we run amok because the first thing you can think of it's the same as the question
people have with asias if we don't have free will then why then why care then why should
we try and be good why should we why why should we you know let's just do what we do with me
you know I'm not responsible for what I do so who cares and I think just like for atheism
I mean you could have that attitude but I think the thing you point out is that
that even that that's not a natural consequence of accepting the the the absence of free will
any more than accepting that there's not a god if you look at the statistics and you look at the
data is not does not promise naturally behavior quote unquote immorally that that um that when
you actually look at the data people who who who who don't believe in in in a god generally
don't behave anymore immorally then and often sometimes more ethically than people who do
I want to let you elaborate on that which is thank god because that solves the running amok
problem the literature there's been like a handful of studies about the ethical implications of
making people believe more or less in free will but there's a massive literature on the relationship
between ethical behavior and belief in deities and stuff and it's exactly what you show in part
because a lot of the time religious people are telling you about how ethical they're being and
a lot of the time you're measuring things as being ethical which don't really matter to
atheists and all sorts of other confounds in there but the most interesting thing about that
literature is exactly paralleled in the free will one you know prime someone to believe less in free
will for the next 10 minutes and they cheat more on a on a economic game and and even though it's
not clear if that really does happen all the time but get someone who hasn't believed in free will
for a long long time and they're as exactly as ethical as someone who really believes in
very hard and the religion equivalent is one that like I don't know why I get some sort of almost
transcendent something out of when you look at people who have thought long and hard about
where does goodness come from and what sort of person I want to be and what does this all mean
and why are we here and if they've thought long and hard about it it almost doesn't matter if their
conclusion is and there's no free will or there's no god or if their conclusion is there's a god
with all these attributes on the average they're going to be more ethical than other people
because they've thought long and hard and it's the doing that that's almost certainly the guarantee
because you care about what counts as the right way to live your life enough to have thought
long and hard about it and enough to have had a moment of crisis and enough to have felt lonely
because there's no god or enough to yeah it's because that stuff matters to you enough to have
thought about it and to have thought about how you feel about it and that's what it's about
we're not going to run amok if we train kids and people with as much value laden ideas about why
are you the way you are and why did this person become the way they became as we invest in
theological or agentive arguments about it it would be we're not going to run amok
you know and here's a psychological experiment I've done because I you know with the atheist thing
not the free will thing with you know you give a you give the standard you know somewhere the
standard dialogue you know how we trust you atheists be moral if you don't think god holds and if you
you know um and and what when I hear that I always ask the question and and I've done this to
audience it only wants to did someone come up where I say okay if you didn't believe in god would
you go and kill your neighbor right now and and and and you know and generally except for one
exception where someone put his head said yes um you know people say no because they have reason
they have thought they you know they and and that's and by the way that's Steve Pinker's argument
for why god is redundant because you know if god's if god said rape and murder was of innocent
people was okay would it be okay and and and and and and most people say no and then you say well
then Steve Pinker would say well just get rid of the middle man you don't need the god
to say it but I think the point is if you ask people okay just imagine you believe god would you
then you know steal from your neighbor you know beat your kids uh and people you know and and
that when I think about they realize that it's not even if they think it's their belief in god
even if that's what they're telling them fundamentally if they have reason they're
they're they think of all the reasons why they shouldn't be doing the bad behavior anyway
and it's it's superfluous and I think the same you know is true for free will ultimately that
if you think of reason and rationality you're gonna the behavior is going to be the same
regardless of whether you believe in free will or not so that's my little psychological
memory you try it in your class sometimes to see if if if anyone would but it's good to me
yeah you know but you give the example of course of Scandinavia everyone's perfect example of the
idyllic society it's having problems now but but um but you know that there's a you know a
secular society where people on the whole are you know better behaved and and more and more generous
blah blah blah we won't go into it you give a lot of examples I would argue that part of the reason
is the same reason I'm invigorated by the fact of lack of meaning in the universe is that if you
focus on the here and now if the here and now is all there is then you pay much more attention
to the here and now and and and if you pay much more attention to the here and now
and you're rational you're going to begin to behave in a in on the on the whole in
in a in a in the kind of the kind of you might say ethically good behavior that happens naturally so
so getting rid of the here of the hereafter and and instead of thinking of now as the all that is
is is is actually a positive motivator to behave well not a negative one exactly yep now
and you do point out the religion your religion generally tends to have people treat people better
but only in they're in group and the world is an example of that but again I would argue that
that's not so much a problem of religion we ran once in my institute I ran a workshop in the origins
of xenophobia but surely I mean that's again something over which we don't have control right
even at the biological level the immune system is the is the very basis of xenophobia right as as
beautiful way of stating it yeah I mean you know and and if it works for single-tailed
animals and immune system and you know it's it's a natural thing we have to overcome it
as rational beings just as we have to ultimately overcome our illusion of free will
it's the same thing and so yeah I don't blame religion for that I blame evolution
um but but here's where um
I see hope in where it's sometimes in where you see um despair maybe I don't know whether it's
really that strong you have a great section on how we learn I mean it's beautiful I never knew
I knew about Eric Kandel but I never I never I never knew these beautiful diagrams and it's
just a lovely way of learning about the neurobiology of how learning happens it's just beautiful
just spectacular and then you find out like this is occurring in sea slugs it's the same
molecules in us it's unbelievable that same molecules in sea slugs and us which is why
learning about how change occurs not only shows you that that's not incompatible with dropping
free will it it proves that you can see the building blocks you can you can see the building
blocks are black same and you can see how learning exactly you can see that it's not some again it's
not a mystery it's I mean it's at some level it is but I mean at the fundamental basic level you
can see how naturally it's possible for a system and not only that you can see how that neurobiology
of learning is affected by stress and conditioning because you can see when these you know how these
neurotransmitters are going to be whether they're going to be expressed or how well the system is
going to receive them and respond to them are based on environment and so you can see exactly
how how environment and past experience will affect learning as well but you see that's where
the fact that change happens is for me the great hope because I guess I see I've often said and
now I don't know whether you know and I guess I'd say I call this better living through chemistry
but which is really what's happening is it's thinking about how the world really works
can give us more effective ways of producing a better world than living under the illusion
that it works other ways and um and so let me give you my thinking on this and I want to see
what you think what you think about this that
I've as I was about to say before I've often said and I don't know if I'll say anymore that
we live in a world in which there's no free will but for all intents and purposes it's a world that
it is identical it looks identical on the surface to a world in which there is free will
so it and what I said following that and now I'm going to change what I say I think I said
and therefore it makes sense to behave as if we have free will now in some sense I I think that's
still true but now I would amend that I would say it's all and it's indistinguishable on the
surface from a world in which there is free will but but we should behave in a way that
understanding that that's a that's an illusion but reproducing it in a positive way by realizing
that there isn't free will namely we can we may not have choice to now what we wish to do and this
is what I was saying earlier but by learning we can change and therefore if we realize we don't
have free will we can say how can I be a better person well let me think of the of the neuro
neurobiological influences that I can have today tomorrow the next day so that the day afterwards
when I think of the antecedents that cause me to behave a certain way those new antecedents will
be will allow me to act better than it was now because and so I see recognizing change and only
understanding that there's no free will is a way to actually do what you think you're doing by free
will namely becoming a better person cool and there goes dent it down the drain among other
things that's that's beautiful I mean amid that is our grounds for hope and that is our grounds for
like neural plasticity things can change things can change in awful direction someone who was
open minded and tolerant back when is now a bitter old whatever but it can go in opposite
directions as well and understanding not how to change yourself but understanding the circumstances
in which you will be changed in a beneficial way is a very good thing and it's the effective
way of doing it it's if you can only do it effectively if you understand how it happens
and if you have this illusion that you have a choice then you'll probably never be able to
effectively change eat while you might be able to but but it's an accident and and and and it's
I think it's not just true and and you've illustrated between say 1922 and 2022 it's not
just the case an individual level it's the case in a societal level by learnings and well you know
you and I are devoted I think to learning it's it's an education we can that is a way to affect our
understanding and our behavior in a way that makes not just us better individuals but society
is a whole better so we don't draw on quarter people we don't have public hangings even though
we wreck but we can only do that once again and you you have an amazing chapter on which is scary
on retribution and and punishment to show that we love it and and but once again knowing that we
love it is the same things knowing that we don't believe if you will that's okay knowing it gives
you the opportunity to overcome that to overcome that which is hardwired or in one way and to
know how to change your environment in a way so that you don't you don't enjoy punishment as much
yeah it lets you figure out like the joy of retribution okay how much does it weigh what
does it smell like does it do more of this or that in this circumstance here's how we could
turn brutally violent people into people who will be like really aggressive sons of bitches
when they play chess yeah yeah when they play chess exactly and you talk and and you talk about
it's really hard you talk about Scandinavia but you know you people want to punish people who've
done really bad things but of course and and this is this is where I would also sort of
differ and at least semantically describing things I think you would say people don't have
responsibility for their actions in a fundamental sense and I would say we should treat them as
if they have responsibility but that doesn't involve punishment okay if I run someone over
I ran them over there's no denying that fact I'm responsible for the fact that they got run over
now I may not have had control over that but then the response to that is saying okay you're
responsible what can we do to ensure that that doesn't happen again that should be the the response
not I'm going to slap you in the head but you are respond I would say you are responsible but the
but if we understand where it comes from the the the response to that responsibility is a very
different one it's to say how can we ensure sure if you have schizophrenia we have to probably ensure
that you're not in a position to hurt other people not punishment and if there's a treatment
we have responsibility to treat um you're you're just you're dichotomizing between what you're
calling responsibility and control yeah I would use a dichotomy between mechanistic responsibility
and moral responsibility but it's the exact same thing as what you just said yeah yeah and and and
well and but you talk about it you know and I think you're arguing about quarantine is a lovely
one you talk about the origin of the word and you really in some you're really quarantining people
just as you'd quarantine people who have no other kind of sickness in a way that protects others
around them but not as punishment you know you're not keeping a kid at home from school as punishment
if they have a cold you're doing it you know for other reasons and um and that and this quarantine
which can be and as you say what is punishment punishment which is a lovely word in Scandinavia
where you think that you know taking people have done horrific things like you give the example of
this well-known serial killer the guy who killed all those people on that island in in in in sweden
um with sweden or norway I can't remember anyway it's one of those scorned countries yeah norway
I think um and what they put them in jail and put them in a in an environment where he is you know a
nice environment to live in and and their attitude is you know um let's see if we can make sure he
he you know whatever conditions cause me to do that again cause me to do that won't happen again
which is very rational thing to say although most of us you know many people intrinsically
emotionally want to say kill the bastard draw on quarter the bastard do this you know and um and
what the Scandinavian culture has produced as the response to the horror of him is that instead
of a visceral desire to make him hurt what all those interviews of parents of etc showed
was a visceral desire to be able to say yeah we never have to think about this guy again
his grandiosity yeah he's a clown he's a violent clown but good he's away we never have to think
about him again that's what their culture has been able to detour the viscera of grief
and if we think about it logically I think we can say we can direct our culture in that direction
I mean even we don't have the so yeah we naturally might our our inclinations and our experience
might not make us want to do that now but understanding how change happens the very thing
that you some sense say is depressing to me offers great hope in fact the only hope I think
ultimately to get better is to understand how the world really works if you don't understand
how the world really works it's an accident if if you improve it it's a complete accident
and and I guess I would I would pray I'm giving you words that may be useful but I when I read
your stuff I thought it this almost sounds like a the kind of thing some self-help artists would
say but I think it's true the the change we want doesn't come from within it comes from without
the change we want is going to come from without it's going to put ourselves in circumstances
which can cause a change it's not going to come from willpower we don't have because we didn't
have it in the first place now become the sort of person who was able to put themselves in
the different circumstance yeah the last two things and I want to go another two or three
minutes you've been great maybe five minutes I want to come back to Dan Dennis about not during
during praise for accomplishments which you mentioned which I thought was it is hysterical
and so as if that's what it's all about then what are we talking about for but but more than that
actually I again I'm going to present myself as a devil's advocate I don't think we disagree
but I would say that accomplishments
we don't deserve praise for the accomplishments it's the same we go back to the ancient Romans you
know who separated the artists from the art which I you know I first learned that I used to like
ancient history and I was amazed it seemed so foreign to me but it's again so obvious I thought
well okay so this is the artist's big deal they would say God you know he's God is speaking to
them but that doesn't make this person particularly good but what we can do is we can say accomplishments
can be recognized as amazing and you can be recognized as amazing if you're brilliant or you
know it's not something that intrinsically means you're good or we have to have them back for
but we can say yeah let's recognize you're an amazing person it's nothing wrong with that
you've achieved something amazing let's all celebrate that so I guess I can instrumental
what was that only if it's instrumental only if it inspires other people yeah yeah that person
more likely to do it again that's as good of a tool as anything sure yeah but I mean the fact
that you had no choice at some level in being the person you are doesn't make your accomplishments
less amazing doesn't make Einstein less amazing doesn't make you less amazing to me you're still
amazing to me even if I know you didn't have choice Robert you really are but yeah so I think
I think recognize that I saw you I think you know even someone like Dan Denneken at least
you know say okay well the book you've written one you know or the or the arguments you've given
are amazing arguments and they've convinced me of this or that and yeah we'll give a prize for
the amazing arguments you're the person who happens to receive it big deal but the arguments are the
you know it's and it's like what you know in some sense it's what I've won prizes you've won prizes
but I try to have the attitude of Feynman in that regard who basically said yeah the prize is nice
but the real the really neat thing was the discovery you know that's that's what the great
and that's and finding that out is cool it's the thing as you would say is cool and that's what
makes it worthwhile not the prize this I want to end with two things this was a hard book for you to
write it's clear it was a hard book for you to write I mean the agony of some of saying some of
the things that you say that you know it are going to be unpopular or difficult for people to accept
that may sound nutty as you say at one point or another clearly give you pause how do you feel
after having written it nervous as to who is going to feel deeply offended and hurt by it but
at least on a local level as a college teacher I've like flaunted my atheism enough to
have a little bit of experience of the pushback that it gets although mine has always been
very compassionate concerned people who are saying please please please I want to be able to
save your soul I love you your soul is in danger all of it you know what am I expecting with that
what I'm expecting in addition is having to focus a whole lot more on
I've met hundreds of pages and decades of thought about this stuff I don't live this way most of
the time I'm hired in judgment and entitlement and all that sort of stuff and like 1% of the time
I can achieve this mindset and because I've been trying to do it for a long time I like to think
I achieve it in circumstances where it's more consequential like should we consider somebody's
well-being and needs to have been earned to be greater than we consider somebody else's
you know let's stop for a second and really think about it because that doesn't make sense
and then I can I can think that way more importantly I can feel that way for a couple
of minutes at a time before it disappears well that's what I was asking I mean some books I've
written I didn't know which have just changed the way I think about the world without you know I knew
what I wanted to say but having written them they they they allow they help me personally
is this self-help at all having having formulated this in a coherent way does it help you spend
maybe instead of 1% of your time 2% of your time yes yes and not because this has been a journey
of intellectual discovery because oh my god I'm sitting here talking about this still sorts of
people when I do one of those they're going to be on top of me in a second so I kind of let's try
to live this way a little bit more maybe maybe that's the cynical out in I once went to one of
those Dalai Lama conferences where he hangs out with a bunch of neuroscientists instead of bunch
of his like all-star monks yeah we all talk to each other then we realize our vocabularies are so
different then I did same thing the Vatican wants and we're not to say each other you're a braver
man than me and who you hung out with and like at one point one of the monks said something about
what they do with their anger with it and they said something that was totally unexpected and it was
gorgeous and it was something I could never have never reviewed the world for and I said wow that's
amazing this guy functions on a different planet wow that would be and all that's come out of all
of this is like yeah like every now and then I can do that and that's good when you do able to do it
but you just said something that actually was comes to the actually last thing one of the last
pages in your book but when you said maybe you know it's not right to think that one person's needs
and desires are more than the other and you say the only possible moral conclusion is that you are
no more entitled to have your needs and desires met than is any other human there's no human who's
less entitled than you to have their well being considered well in fact that's a philosophy which
actually Peter Singer I mean it's fresh on my mind because I've talked to Peter the principle of
equal consideration which he says is true not just for humans you're being you know um speciesist
as he would say but no no being has more entitled than any other being to have their needs and
desires met and not need to suffer it's a so what you've been driven to by this is a beautiful
philosophy of in some sense effective altruism but more importantly the philosophy that that
that's led Peter to I think to be an amazingly ethical individual about about about humans
and other animals it's changed my own thinking I have to say about the world that not I think
this argument can be extended and it's natural to to to beyond humans to other species as well
just don't expect me to find it to be easy to be that way all the time and don't expect it's
going to be easy for you but it'll be a good thing if we do because yeah yeah exactly it's not I'm
now I'm now a vegetarian for example and I wasn't before and it's not you know well it wasn't that
difficult um um but learning the last let me end with the last few sentences of your book because
I want to I think it's nice those in the future will marvel at what we didn't yet know which really
resonates with me because of course as you know my new book is exactly that I love the fact that
it'll be out of date and and the fact that not knowing is what it's all about and that and if
they don't marvel at what we don't know then my goodness we've made a big mistake that we've
progress has ended there will be scholars opining about why in the course of a few decades around
the start of the third millennium most people stopped opposing gay marriage history majors
will struggle on final exams to remember whether it was the 19th 20th or 21st centuries when people
began to understand epigenetics they will view us as being as ignorant as we now view the goitered
presence peasants who thought satan caused seizures that borders on the inevitable but it
need not be inevitable that they also view us as heartless and I think that that's that's important
that means it what you and I have been talking about together that we can learn to change and be
less heartless but only understanding how the world works so I don't view this book and your work as
in any way depressing or pessimistic just as I take the fact that there's no meaning in the
universe as energizing I take this beautiful piece of work on understanding how the world
really works at the level of behavior as uplifting and a blueprint for thinking about how can we
can make the world a better place so I think you've done God's work as my atheist friend
Steve Weinberg used to say so thank you so very much it's been a blessing to you it's been a real
pleasure and I know I appreciate the time that you allowed me to take of yours and I wanted to do
well I thought I wanted to to give you the time that was necessary I wanted to I wanted to give
it the arguments the time they deserved and we could have spent longer but it's been a pleasure
likewise I hope we could do this in the same room sometime and talk for hours and hours and
hours because I'm looking forward to that it's a it's a real privilege thanks again
