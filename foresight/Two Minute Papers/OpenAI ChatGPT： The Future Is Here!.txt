Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.
Yes, yes, the chat GPT episode is finally here, and today you are going to see a glimpse
of the future.
Wow, this is chat GPT, a variant of the GPT-3 Language Model AI that was unleashed to read
the internet.
And now, we can use it as a conversational agent.
And I cannot believe that this thing exists.
It can do interior design, it can write history essays, computer code, solve your math homework,
can give you ideas for new YouTube videos, or even make a marketing plan.
And you can also use it for free, I'll tell you in a moment how.
And OpenAI showcased how it can be used to, for instance, write a short letter to introduce
us to our new neighbors.
And here we go, a kind message.
Now, so far, this is not such a big deal, anyone could retrieve this from somewhere,
so let's ask it to do something more productive with it, transform it somehow.
Hmm, how about making it a little more formal?
Nice, this is indeed a little more formal.
And something very cool also happened here.
Did you notice?
Oh, yes, when we added additional instructions here, chat GPT remembered what we just talked
about during this follow up question, and it also takes additional directions.
Very cool.
Actually, let's give it a piece of broken computer code, and let's see what this chat
GPT can do with it.
So, can you have a look at this?
This is a program written in the Go language, it can, and it asks, what exactly is the problem?
Much like a human would, that is a good start.
And after a little clarification, my goodness, it found the issue and even proposed a solution
for it.
And if you think that is absolutely incredible, you are indeed right, but it is nothing compared
to what is to come now, so hold on to your papers for eight amazing results its users
recently came up with.
One of our fellow scholars, Chesto, shows you the proper technique to hold on to your papers
for this video.
So one, it can help us come up with creative ways of decorating living rooms.
Look at these text prompts.
Wait, are you thinking what I am thinking?
Oh yes, we can now plug this into a text to image AI and…
Wow!
This is the fairy tale inspired living room with an elegant chandelier made out of branches.
Note that the AI came up with the idea of the room and a separate AI for the image of
the room itself too.
There is also an enchanted forest themed living room too, and of course, for you fellow scholars
who wish to live in the future, your wish is also granted.
This is insane.
By the way, these images were created by using Meet Journey, if you wish to see a standalone
episode about this image generator AI, make sure to like this video and leave a comment
about it.
If you fellow scholars wish to see it, it might come about soon.
Two, it knows about algorithms, what we can expect when using them.
Here, a user asked chat GPT what the time complexity of the infamous bubble sort algorithm
is and it not only knows exactly how poor it is, but look at that.
It can also say all this in the style of a 1940s gangster movie.
Alright pal, listen up.
A gangster math tutor.
I already love it.
And the style permeates the whole narrative, not just the start.
This is incredible.
Three, it can write a full academic essay.
This is a college level history problem, likely not something that you can just retrieve from
somewhere and present to the user.
And look at that.
It spans exactly four paragraphs as the user asked.
Even OpenAI's previous techniques had a great deal of trouble with that.
A full history essay in just a couple of seconds.
Four, have a look at this one.
One do fried eggs, sunny side up, eat for breakfast.
It says that eggs are not known to eat anything for breakfast.
Wow.
Yes, that is super important.
Why is that?
Well, because it means that chat GPT can question incorrect premises.
This is huge.
Previous techniques eat these up really easily.
For instance, OpenAI's previous method was very easily convinced that birds aren't real.
And this one, not so much.
But let's try an even sneakier one.
When was the Golden Gate Bridge transported for the second time across Egypt?
What do you think, little AI?
And nope, it's not falling for this one either.
Five, it can also write lyrics for a new song and you will not believe this.
Look, it wrote a variant of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody, but in a scholarly setting.
It is so good, please stop the video and read at least a couple lines of it.
It is so good, you could actually sing this.
Perhaps a couple more papers down the line, the AI will sing this itself.
Incredible.
Six, my friend Andrew Price had a great idea, or the lack thereof, you see, he wanted to
use it to generate new ideas for YouTube videos.
Not bad.
Actually, let's put this idea on steroids.
Seven, it can even create a marketing strategy plan for us.
And this is not just a general run of the mill request, no no, it contains concrete
data and it asks for a cost breakdown for each of the steps.
And we get exactly that.
Insanity.
Eight, here is a personal one from me.
We are not native English speakers, so I am trying to teach my 6 year old daughter English
and I am absolutely delighted that today we can speak approximately 15-20% of our daily
talking in English.
It is really cool, I love it.
So how about creating a board game that would be a playful way to teach her some more?
What do you think, chat GPT?
Hmm, this is not bad.
You can get a board with a bunch of game pieces and you can move your piece forward when you
have learned something new.
Not bad.
But you are experienced fellow scholars over here, you know full well that we are not going
to let this little AI have it so easy.
Now make a fantasy version of this.
And now the game really came to life with dragons, wizards and warriors.
And it also recommends that the vocabulary of the game is also adapted to this fantasy
world.
Fantastic.
I love it.
And I bet that a real pro game designer, for instance, the mighty Day 9 could really create
some amazing games with it.
And plus one, you know what, a good piece of work should always be compared to the state
of the art, so let's compare it to the all knowing oracle of the internet, Google.
So Google, how do I represent a differential equation?
This is an answer, okay?
But now let's have a look at chat GPT.
This is so much cleaner and so much more insightful.
Actually, if you allow me, let me add my own example here.
Let's roll up those sleeves, because now we will truly see what chat GPT is made of.
You see, when I was a college student, I used to drive my math professors mad by solving
simple problems with more powerful mathematical tools than they expected.
For instance, I like to solve differential equations through a Laplace transform.
If you wish to do that, you can look it up on Wikipedia.
Well, that's an explanation, but how about this?
Oh my, I like this.
What you see here is a LaTAC notation.
This can be inserted into a paper super easily, but in the interest of readability, let's
ask it to write it with a simpler notation.
There we go.
We get a beautiful, simple step-by-step breakdown.
Now let's see what you're made of, little AI.
Don't just solve it by hand, now write a C++ computer program to solve it.
We get a simple piece of code with lots of well-made comments, very easy to follow, and
it even runs it on a concrete example.
Interestingly, the explanation suddenly stops, this is a common occurrence.
And we say, continue.
Thank you.
Now, let's be lazy and ask it to run this program by itself and tell us what came out.
And it does that too.
And if we wish to come up with a different example, that takes approximately three seconds.
This is absolutely incredible, a real AI tutor to teach us proper mathematics.
And listen up, oh yes, don't forget, it can even do it in the style of our choice.
And we can even ask it whether a Fourier transform could have been used here.
Hmm, it knows that this is not quite what it is for, nice.
And okay, you got me.
Let's behave like a normal person and solve this differential equation the traditional
way.
Thank you.
And finally, let's try to break it.
Now implement this in an assembly program.
This is a challenging language that is really low to the ground, close to the metal.
Not for the faint of the heart.
And oh my goodness, it went to town on this one.
And if you spotted some errors in these derivations, let me know in the comments so I can highlight
them.
And if that happens, perhaps the best part is that this new AI can admit its mistakes,
often even fix them, it can challenge incorrect premises and reject inappropriate requests.
That is simply mind blowing.
What a time to be alive.
Now note that this is still not perfect, limitations still apply.
It is not always right, so please always make sure to verify the validity of the answers
yourself.
Always double check from multiple sources.
That is the way of the true scholar.
And if you connect this to a speech model, which you can already do on your phone, and
with some more improvements, this would make ChatGPT perhaps the coolest smartphone assistant
the world has ever seen.
My goodness, and it feels like this, just came out of the blue.
And just imagine what this will be able to do two more papers down the line.
For instance, if you look a couple papers back, this is OpenAI GPT2.
The best it could do was to finish our sentences, and not nearly as well as a human would.
And now it can do all this.
This might change how we organize our knowledge forever.
And good news, yes, you can try it yourself right now through the link in the video description.
Will we fellow scholars crash OpenAI's website with our scholar list emptied?
Who really knows?
Also, I have waited a couple weeks to publish this video to make sure I can get you a better
coverage and more examples as they appear over time.
Of course, being late is not great for views, but that doesn't matter.
What matters is that you get a proper video where we can celebrate these amazing works
and flip out together.
If you enjoyed it, please consider pressing like and maybe subscribing.
It really helps us create more content like this.
