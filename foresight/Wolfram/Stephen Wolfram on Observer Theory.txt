okay hello everyone well yesterday I posted an essay about observer theory
that's kind of a convergence of a lot of things I've thought about for the last
several years and it's kind of a core piece of the framework sort of the
intellectual framework for the things we've done the physics project the
Rouliad multi computation bunch of other kinds of applications of that so I
thought what I would do here is tell you what I said in this essay that I
posted so the subject is observer theory and the first part is called the
concept of the observer we call it perception we call it measurement we
call it analysis but in the end it's about how we take the world as it is
and derive from it the impression of it that we have in our minds we might have
thought that we could do science purely objectively without any reference to
observers or their nature but what we've discovered particularly dramatically in
our physics project is that the nature of us as observers is critical even in
determining the most fundamental laws we attribute to the universe but what
ultimately does an observer say like us do and how can we make a theoretical
framework for it much as we have a general model for the process of
computation instantiated by something like a Turing machine we'd like to have a
general model for the process of observation a general observer theory
central to what we think of as an observer is the notion that the observer
will take the raw complexity of the world and extract from it some reduced
representation suitable for a finite mind there might be zillions of photons
impinging on our eyes but all we extract is the arrangement of objects in a
visual scene or there might be zillions of gas molecules impinging on a piston
yet all we extract is the overall pressure of the gas in the end we can
think of it as fundamentally being about equivalencing there are immense
numbers of different individual configurations for the photons or the
gas molecules that are all treated as equivalent by an observer who's just
picking out the particular features needed for some reduced representation
there's in a sense a certain duality between computation and observation in
computation ones generating new states of a system in observation ones
equivalencing together different states that equivalencing must in the MB
implemented underneath by computation but in observer theory what we want to
do is just characterize the equivalencing that's achieved for us as
observers it might in practice be all about how our senses work what our
biological or cultural nature is or what technological devices or structures
we've built but what makes a coherent concept of observer theory possible is
that it seemed to be general abstract characterizations that capture the
essence of different kinds of observers it's not immediately obvious that
anything suitable for a finite mind could ever be extracted from the complexity
of the world and indeed the principle of computational equivalence implies that
computational irreducibility and its multi computational generalization will
be ubiquitous but within computational irreducibility there must always be
slices of computational reducibility and it's these slices of reducibility an
observer must try to pick out and that ultimately make it possible for a
finite mind to develop a useful narrative about what happens in the
world that allows it to make decisions predictions and so on how special is what
an observer does at its core it's just about taking a large set of possible
inputs and returning a much smaller set of possible outputs and certainly that's
a conceptual idea that's appeared in many fields under many different names
contractive mapping reduction to canonical form a classifier an
acceptor a forgetful functor evolving to an attractor extracting statistics
model fitting lossy compression projection phase transitions renormalization
group transformations and so on but here we want to think not about what's
mathematically describable but instead about what is generally what in general
is actually implemented say by our senses or our measuring devices or our
ways of analyzing things at an ultimate level everything that happens can be
thought of as being captured by the really add the unique object that emerges
at the entangled limit of all possible computations and a vast generalization of
ideas like that our brains like any other material thing are made of it it's a
vast generalization of ideas like that our brains like any other material
thing are made of atoms so too any observer must be embedded as some kind
of structure within the really add but a key concept of observer theory is that
it's possible to make conclusions about an observer's impression of the world
just by knowing about the capabilities and assumptions of the observer without
knowing in detail what the observer is like inside and so it is for example in
our physics project we seem to be able to derive essentially from the structure
of the rule ad the core laws of 20th century physics general relativity
quantum mechanics the second law just on the basis of two features of us as
observers that we're computationally bounded and that we believe we're
persistent in time even though underneath we're made of different atoms of space at
every successive moment and we can expect that if we were to take if we were to
include other features of us as observers for example we that we believe we
are persistent objects in the world or that we believe we have free will then
we'd be able to derive more aspects of the universe as we experience it or of
natural laws that we attribute to it but the notion of observers and observer
theory isn't purely limited to physical observers it applies whenever we try to
get an impression of something and so for example we can also operate as
mathematical observers sampling the rule ad to build up conclusions about
mathematical laws some features of us as physical observers like the
computational boundedness associated with the finiteness of our minds
inevitably carry over to us as mathematical observers but other features
do not but the point of observer theory is to provide a general framework in
which we can characterize observers and then see the consequences of those
characterizations for the impressions or conclusions observers will form so now
we'll talk about the operation of observers as humans we have sensors like
sight hearing touch taste smell and balance and through our technology we
also have access to a few thousand other kinds of measurements so how
basically do the all these work the vast majority in effect aggregate a large
number of small inputs to generate some kind of average output which in the case
of measurement is often specified as a real number in a few cases however
there's instead a discrete choice between outputs that's made on the basis of
whether the total input exceeds the threshold think distributed consensus
schemes weighing balances and so on but in all cases what's fundamentally
happening is that lots of different input configurations are all being
equivalents or more operationally the dynamics of the system essentially make
all equivalent states evolved the same attractor state so as an example let's
consider measuring the pressure of a gas there are various ways to do this but a
direct one is to have a piston and just see how much force is exerted by the
gas on this piston so where does the force come from at the lowest level it's
the result of individual molecules bouncing off the surface of the piston
each transferring a tiny amount of momentum to it if we looked at the
piston at an atomic scale we'd see it temporarily deform from each molecular
impact but the crucial point is that at a large scale the piston moves together
as a single rigid object aggregating the effects of all those individual
molecular impacts but why does it work that way essentially it's because the
intermolecular forces inside the piston are much stronger than the forces
associated with molecules and the gas or put more abstractly there's more
coupling and coherence inside the observer than between the observer and
what it's observing we see that same pattern over and over again there's
some form of transduction that couples the individual elements of what's being
observed to the observer then within the observer there's something that in
essence aggregates all those small effects sometimes that aggregation is
directly numerical as in the addition of small lots of small momentum transfers
but sometimes it's instead more explicitly like evolution to one to one
attractor rather than another so consider for example the case of vision an
array of photons fall on the photoreceptor cells and our retinas
generating electrical signals transmitted through nerve fibers to our brains
within the brain there's then effectively a neural net that evolves to
different attractors depending on what one's looking at most of the time a
small change in input image won't affect what attractor one evolves to but much
like with a weighing balance there's an edge at which even a small change can
lead to a different output one can go through lots of different types of
sensory systems and measuring devices but the basic outline seems to always
be the same first there's a coupling between what is being sensed or measured
and the thing that's doing the sensing or measuring quite often that coupling
involves transducing from one physical form to another say from
light to electricity or from force to position sometimes then the crucial
step of equivalencing different detailed inputs is achieved by simple
numerical aggregation most often by accumulation of objects atoms raindrops
etc or by physical effects forces currents and so on but sometimes the
equivalencing is instead achieved by more obviously dynamical process it could
amount to simple amplification in which say the presence of a small element of
input say an individual particle tips over some meta stable system so that it
goes into a certain final state or it could be more like a neural net where
there's a more complicated translation defined by hard to describe borders
between basins of attraction leading to different attractors
but okay so what's the end point of a process of observation
ultimately for us humans it's an impression created in our minds
of course that gets into lots of slippery philosophical issues
yes each of us has an inner experience of what's going on in our mind
but anything else is ultimately an extrapolation we make the assumption
that other human minds also see what we see
but we can never feel it from the inside we can of course make increasingly
detailed measurements of neural activity to see how similar what's going on is
between one brain and another but as soon as there's the slightest
structural situational difference between the brains we really can't say
exactly how their impressions will compare but for our purposes in
constructing a general observer theory we're basically going to make the
assumption or in effect philosophical approximation
that whenever a system does enough equivalencing that's tantamount to it
acting like an observer because it can then act
as a front end that takes the incoherent complexity of the world
and columnates it to the point where a mind will derive
impression from a definite impression from it
of course there's still a lot of subtlety here there has to be just enough
equivalencing and not too much for example if all inputs were always
equivalence to the same output there'd be nothing useful observed
and in the end there's somehow got to be some kind of match between the
compression of input achieved by the equivalencing
and the capacity of the mind that's ultimately deriving an impression from
it a crucial feature of anything that can
reasonably be called a mind is that something's got to be going on in there
it can't be for example that the internal state of the system is fixed
there has to be some internal dynamics some computational process
that we can identify as the ongoing operation of the mind
at an informational level we might say that there has to be
more information processing going on inside than there is flow of information
from the outside or in other words if we're going to be meaningful observers
like us we can't just be bombarded by input we don't process
we have to have some capability to think about what we're seeing
all of this comes back to the idea that a crucial feature of us as observers
is that we are computationally bounded we do computation
that's why we can have an inner sense of things going on
but the amount of computation we do is tiny compared to the computation going
on in the world around us our experience represents a heavily
filtered version of what's happening outside and the
essence of being an observer like this is that we're effectively doing lots of
equivalencing to get that filtered version
but can we imagine a future in which we expand our minds
or perhaps encounter some alien intelligence with a fundamentally
less constrained mind well at some point there's an issue
with this because in a sense the idea that we have a coherent
existence relies on us having limited minds
so without such constraints there wouldn't be a coherent self
that we can identify with coherent inner experience
well let's say we're showing some system say nature from the outside
can we tell if there's an observer in there ultimately not because in a sense
we'd have to be inside that observer and be able to experience the
impression of the world that it's getting but in much the same way as we
extrapolate to believing that say other human minds
are experiencing things like we're experiencing so also we can potentially
extrapolate to say what we might think of as an observer
and the core idea seems to be that an observer should be a subsystem
whose internal states are affected by the rest of the system
but where many external states let states
lead to the same internal state and where there is rich dynamics
within the observer then in effect operates only on its internal states
ultimately following the principle of computational equivalence
both the outside and the inside of the observer subsystem
can be expected to be equivalent in the computations they're performing
but the point is that the coupling from the outside subs from outside the
subsystem to inside effectively coarse grains what's
outside so that the inner computation is operating on a much reduced set of
elements why should any such observer subsystems
exist presumably at some level it's inevitable
from the presence of pockets of computational reducibility
within arbitrarily computationally irreducible systems
but more important for us is that our very existence
and the possibility of our coherent inner experience depends on us
operating as observers and almost as a self-fulfilling prophecy
our behavior tends to perpetuate our ability to successfully do this
for example we can think of us as choosing to put ourselves in
situations and environments where we can predict
what's going to happen well enough to survive as observers
at a mundane practical level we might do this by not living in places subject
to unpredictable natural forces or by doing things like building
ourselves structures that shelter us from those forces
well we've talked about observers operating by compressing the complexities
of the world to inner impressions suitable for finite minds
and in typical situations that we describe as perception and measurement
the main way this happens is by fairly direct equivalencing of different
states but in a sense there's a higher level
story that relies on formalization and in essence computation
and that's what we usually call analysis
let's say we have some intricate structure perhaps some nested fractal
pattern a direct rendering of all the pixels in this pattern
ultimately won't be something well suited for a finite mind
but if we gave rules or a program for generating the pattern
we'd have a much more succinct representation of it
but now there's a problem with computational reducibility
yes the rules determine the pattern but to get from those rules
to the actual pattern can require an irreducible amount of computation
and to reverse engineer the pattern to find the rules can require even more
computation yes there are particular cases
like repetitive and simple nested patterns where there's enough immediate
computational reducibility that a computational bounded system
or observer can fairly easily do the analysis and get the compression
but in general it's hard and indeed in a sense it's the whole mission of science
to pick away at the problem and try to find more ways to reduce the complexity
of the world to human level narratives
computational irreducibility limits the extent to which this can be
successful but the inevitable existence of pockets of
reducibility even within computationally
irreducible computational irreducibility guarantees that progress can always in
principle be made as we invent more kinds of
measuring devices we can extend our domain as observers
and the same is true when we invent more methods of analysis
or identify more principles in science but the overall picture remains the same
what's crucial to being an observer is equivalencing many states of the world
either through perceiving or measuring only specific aspects of them
or through identifying simplified narratives that capture them
in effect persistence and measurement tend to do lossy compression
analysis is more about lossless compression
where the equivalencing is effectively not between possible inputs
but between possible generative rules
all right now let's talk about how observers construct their perceived
reality our view of the world is ultimately
determined by what we observe of it we take what's out there in the world
and in effect construct our perceived reality by our operation as observers
or in other words insofar as we have a narrative
about what's going on in the world that's something that comes from our
operation as observers and in fact from our physics project we led to
we're led to an extreme version of this in which what's out there in the world
is just the whole rule ad and in effect everything specific about our perceived
reality must come from how we operate as observers
and thus we how we sample the rule ad
but long before we get to this ultimate level of abstraction
there are lots of ways in which our nature as observers builds our perceived
reality think about any material substance like a fluid
ultimately it's made up of lots of individual molecules doing their thing
but observers like us aren't seeing those molecules
instead we're aggregating things to the point where we can just describe the
system as a fluid that operates according to the narrative
defined by the laws of fluid mechanics but why do things work this way
ultimately it's the result of the repeated story of the interplay between
underlying computational irreducibility and the computational boundedness
of us as observers at the lowest level the motion of the molecules is governed
by simple rules and mechanics but the phenomenon of computational
irreducibility implies that to work out the detailed consequences
of running these rules involves an irreducible amount of computational
work which is something that we as computationally bounded
observers can't do and the result of this is that we'll end up
describing the detailed behavior of the molecules as just random
well i've talked about this at length elsewhere but this is the fundamental
origin of the second law of thermodynamics but for our purposes here
the important point is that it's what makes observers
like us construct the reality of things like fluids
our computational boundedness as observers makes us unable to trace all
the detailed behavior of molecules and leaves us
content to describe fluids in terms of the narrative
defined by the laws of fluid mechanics our physics project implies that it's
the same kind of story with physical space
for our physics project space is ultimately made of a network of relations
or connections between discrete atoms of space
that's progressively being updated in what ends up being a computationally
irreducible way but we as computationally bounded
observers can't decode all the details of what's happening
and instead we end up with a simple aggregate narrative
that turns out to correspond to continuum space operating according to the
laws of general relativity the way both coherent notions of
matter or fluids and space-time emerge for us as observers
can be thought of as a consequence of the equivalencing we do as observers
in both cases there's immense and computationally irreducible complexity
underneath but we're ignoring most of that by
effectively treating different detailed behaviors as equivalent
so that in the end we get to a comparatively simple narrative
more suitable for our finite minds but we should emphasize that what's really
going on in the system is something much more complicated
it's just that we as observers aren't paying attention to that
so our perceived reality is much simpler
okay but what about quantum mechanics well in a sense that's an extreme test
of our description of how observers work and the extent to which the operation
of observers constructs their perceived reality
so let's talk now about the case of quantum mechanics
in our physics project the underlying structure hypergraph that represents
space and everything in it is progressively being rewritten
according to definite rules but the crucial point is that at any given
stage there can be lots of ways this rewriting can happen
and the result is that there's a whole tree of possible states of the universe
that can be generated so given this why do we ever think
that definite things happen in the universe why don't we just think that
there's an infinite tree of branching histories for the universe
well it has to do with our nature as observers
and the equivalency we do at an immediate level we can imagine looking at all
those different possible branching paths for the evolution of the universe
and the key point is that even though they come from different paths of history
two states can just be the same sometimes it'll be obvious that they're
the same sometimes we might have to determine say
whether two hypergraphs are isomorphic but the point is that
to any observer at least one that isn't managing to look at arbitrary
implementation details the states will inevitably be considered equivalent
but now there's a bigger point even though from the outside
there might be a whole branching and merging multi-way graph of histories
for the universe observers like us can't trace that
and in fact all we perceive is a single thread of history
or said another way we believe that we have a single thread of experience
something closely related to our belief that despite the changing
underlying elements from which we're made we're somehow persistent in time
at least during the span of our existence
but operationally how do we go from all those underlying branches of history
to our perceived single thread of history
we can think of the states on different threads of history as being related
by what we call a branching graph that joins states that have immediate
common ancestors and in the limit of many threads
we can think of these different states as being laid out in branching space
in traditional quantum mechanics terms this layout defines a
map of quantum entanglements with each piece of common ancestry
representing an entanglement between states
in physical space whether we're looking at molecules in a fluid
or atoms of space we can think of us operating as observers who are
physically large enough to span many underlying discrete elements
so that what we end up observing is just some kind of aggregate average result
and it's very much the same kind of thing in branching space
we as observers tend to be large enough in branching space to be spread across
an immense number of branches of history so that what we observe is just
an aggregate just aggregate average results
across all those branches well there's lots of detailed complexity and what
happens on different branches just like there is in what happens to
different molecules or different atoms of space
and the reason that there's inevitably computational irreducibility
or in this case more accurately multi computational irreducibility
but computationally bounded observers like us just perceive aggregate results
that average out the underlying apparent randomness
to give a consistent thread of experience and effectively this is what
happens in the transition from quantum to classical behavior
even though there are many possible detailed quantum threads of history
that an object can follow what we perceive corresponds to a single
consistent aggregate classical sequence of behavior
and this is typically true even at the level of our typical observations of
molecules and chemical processes yes there are many possible threads of
history for say a water molecule but most of our observations aggregate
things to the point where we can talk about a definite shape for the molecule
with definite chemical bonds and so on but there is a special situation that
actually looms large in typical discussions of quantum mechanics
we can think of it as the results of doing measurements that aren't
aggregating threads of history to get an average but are instead doing something
more like a weighing balance always tipping one way or the other
in the language of quantum computing we might say that we're arranging things
to be able to measure a single qubit in terms of equivalencing of states
we might say that we're equivalencing lots of underlying states
to specific canonical states like spin up and spin down
why do we get one outcome rather than another
ultimately we can think of it all as depending on the details of us as
observers to see this let's start from the corresponding
question in physical space we might ask why we observe some
particular thing happening well in our physics project
everything about what happens is deterministic but there's still the
arbitrariness of where we are in physical space
we'll always see basically the same laws of physics but the particulars of what
we'll observe depends on where we are say on the surface of the earth
versus an interstellar space and so on is there a theory for where we are in
some sense yes because we can go back and see why all the molecules that make
us up landed in the particular place where they did
but what we can't have as an external theory for
is just which molecules end up making up us
as we experience ourselves from inside in our view of physics and the universe
it's in some sense the only ultimately subjective thing
where our internal experience is situated but the point is that basically
even though it's much less familiar the same thing is going on at the level of
quantum mechanics just as we happen to be at a
certain place in physical space so we're at a certain place in
branchial space looking back we can trace how we
got here but there's no a priori way to determine
where our particular experience will be situated
and that means we can't know what the local branchial environment will be
and so for example what the outcome of balance like measurements will be
just as in traditional discussions of quantum mechanics the mechanics of
doing the measurement which we can think of as effectively equivalencing
many underlying branches of history will have an effect on subsequent behavior
and subsequent measurements but let's say we just look at the
level of the underlying multi-way graph or more specifically the multi-way
causal graph that records causal connections
between different updating events then we can identify a complicated web of
interdependence between events that are time-like space-like
and branch-like separated and this interdependence seems to correspond to
precisely to what's expected from quantum mechanics
in other words even though the multi-way graph is completely determined
the arbitrariness of where the observer is particularly in branchial space
combined with the inevitable interdependence of different aspects of
the multi-way causal graph seems sufficient to reproduce
the not quite purely probabilistic features of quantum mechanics
in making observations of physical space it's common to make a measurement at
one place or time then make another measurement at
another place or time and for example see how they're related
but in actually doing this the observer will have to move from one place to
another and persist from one time to another
and in the abstract it's not obvious that that's possible
for example it could be that an observer won't be able to move without
changing or in other words that pure motion won't be possible for an
observer but in effect this is something we as observers assume about
ourselves and indeed as i've talked about
elsewhere actually this is a crucial part of why we perceive
space-time to operate according to the laws of physics we know
but what about in branchial space we have much less intuition for this than
for physical space but we still effectively believe
that pure motion is possible for us as observers in branchial
space it could be like an observer in physical
space near it say near a space-time singularity
that an observer will get shredded when trying to move in branchial space
but our belief is that typically nothing like that happens
at some level being at different locations in branchial space
presumably corresponds to picking different bases for our quantum states
or effectively to defining our measurements differently and somehow our
belief in the possibility of pure motion in
branchial space seems related to our belief in the
possibility of making arbitrary sequences of choice
the arbitrary making arbitrary sequences of choices
and sets of experiments we do
all right let's talk about observers of abstract worlds
we might have thought that the only thing ultimately out there
for us to observe would be our physical universe
but actually there are important situations where we're essentially
operating not as observers of our familiar physical universe
but instead of what amount to abstract universes
and what we'll see is that the ideas of observer theory seem to apply there too
except that now what we're picking out and reducing to internal impressions
are features not of the physical world but of abstract worlds
our physics project in a sense brings ideas about the physical and abstract
worlds closer and the concept of the rulliard
ultimately leads to a deep unification between them
for what we now imagine is that the physical universe as we perceive it
is just the result of the particular kinds of sampling of the rulliard
made by us as certain kinds of observers
and the point is that we as observers can make other kinds of
samplings leading to what we can describe as abstract universes
and one particularly prominent example of this is mathematics
or rather metamathematics. Imagine starting from all possible axioms for
mathematics then constructing the network of all
possible theorems that can be derived from them
we can consider this as forming a kind of metamathematical universe
and the particular mathematics that some mathematician might study
we can then think of as the result of a mathematical observer
observing that metamathematical universe. There are both close analogies and
differences between this and the experience of a physical
observer in the physical universe. Both ultimately correspond to
samplings of the rulliard but somewhat different ones.
In our physics project we imagine that physical space and everything in it
is ultimately made up of discrete elements that we identify as atoms of
space but in the rulliard in general we can think
of everything as being made up of pure atoms of existence
that we call eames. In the particular case of physics
we interpret these eames as atoms of space
but in metamathematics we can think of eames as corresponding to sub-axiomatic
elements of symbolic structures from which
things like axioms or theorems can be constructed.
The central feature of our interaction with the rulliard for physics
is that observers like us don't track the detailed behavior
of all the various atoms of space instead we equivalence
things to the point where we can get descriptions that are reduced enough
to fit in our minds and something similar is going on in mathematics.
We don't track all the individual sub-axiomatic eames
or usually in practice even the details of fully formalized axioms
and theorems. Instead mathematics typically operates at a much higher level
and more human level dealing not with questions like how real numbers can be
built from eames or even axioms but rather with what can be deduced about
the properties of mathematical objects like real numbers.
In a physics analogy to the behavior of the gas typical human mathematics
operates not at the molecular level of individual eames or even axioms
but rather at the fluid dynamics level of human accessible mathematical concepts.
In effect therefore a mathematician is operating as an observer
who equivalences many detailed configurations ultimately of eames
in order to form a higher level mathematical constructs
suitable for our computationally bounded minds
and while at the outset I might have imagined that anything in the Rulliad
could serve as a possible mathematics the point is that observers like us
can only sample the Rulliad in particular ways leading to only particular
possible forms for human accessible mathematics.
It's a very similar story to the one we've encountered many times in thinking
about physics and studying gases for example we could imagine all sorts of
theories based on tracking detailed molecular motions
but for observers like us with our computational boundedness
we inevitably end up with things like the second row of thermodynamics
the laws of fluid mechanics and in mathematics the main thing we end up
with is higher level mathematics mathematics that we can do directly in
terms of typical textbook concepts rather than
constantly having to drill down to the level of atoms or eames.
In physics we're usually particularly concerned with issues like predicting
how things will evolve through time in mathematics it's more about accumulating
what can be considered true and indeed we can think of an idealized
mathematician as going through the Rulliad and collecting in their minds
a bag of theorems or axioms that they consider to be true
and given such a collection they can essentially follow the entailment paths
defined by computations of the Rulliad to find more theorems to add to their bag
and yes if they put in a false theorem then because a false premise in the
standard set of logic implies everything
they'll end up with an infinite explosion of theorems
that won't fit in a finite mind.
In observing the physical universe we talk about our different possible
senses like vision hearing etc or different kinds of
measuring devices. In observing the mathematical
universe the analogy is basically different possible
kinds of theories or abstractions say algebraic versus geometrical
versus topological versus categorical and so on
with new approaches being like new kinds of measuring devices
particularly when we think in terms of the Rulliad we can expect a certain kind
of ultimate unity in the mathematical universe
but different theories and different abstractions will pick up different
aspects of it just as vision and hearing pick up different aspects of the
physical universe but in a sense observer theory
gives us a global way to talk about this and to characterize what kinds of
observations observers like us can make whether of the physical
universe or the mathematical one. In physics we've then seen in our
physics project how this allows us to find general laws that
describe our perception of the physical world
and that turn out to reproduce the core known laws of physics.
In mathematics we're not as familiar with the concept of general laws
though the very fact that higher level mathematics is possible
is presumably in essence such a law and perhaps the kinds of regularities seen
in areas like category theory are others as are the inevitable dualities we
expect to be able to identify between different fields of
mathematics. All these laws ultimately rely on the
structure of the Rulliad but the crucial point is that they're not
talking about the raw Rulliad instead they're talking about just
certain samplings of the Rulliad that can be done by observers like us
and that lead to certain kinds of internal impressions
in terms of which these laws can be stated.
Mathematics represents a certain kind of abstract setup that's been studied in a
particular detailed way over the centuries but it's not the only kind
of abstract setup we can imagine and indeed there's an even much more
familiar one the use of concepts and words and human
thinking and language. We might imagine that at some time the
distant past our forebears could signify say rocks only by pointing at
individual ones but then there emerged the general
notion of rock captured by a word for rock and once again this is a story of
observers and equivalences. When we look at a rock it presumably
produces all sorts of detailed patterns of neuron firings in our brains
different for each particular rock but somehow presumably essentially through
evolution to an attractor in the neural net in our brains
we equivalence all those patterns to extract our
inner impression of the concept of a rock.
In the typical tradition of quantitative science we tend to be
interested in doing measurements that lead to things like numerical results
but in representing the world using language we tend to be interested
instead in creating symbolic structures that involve collections
of discrete words embedded in a grammatical framework.
Such linguistic descriptions don't capture every detail.
In a typical observer kind of way they broadly equivalence many things
in a sense reduce the complexity of the world to a description in terms of a
limited number of discrete words and linguistic forms.
Within any person's given person's brain there'll be thoughts defined by
patterns of neuron firings and the crucial role of language
is to provide a robustly a way to robustly package up
those thoughts and for example represent them with discrete words
so that they can be communicated to another person
and unpacked in that person's brain to produce neuron firings
that reproduce what amounts to the same those same thoughts.
When we're dealing with something like a numerical measurement we might imagine
that it could have some kind of absolute interpretation
but words are much more obviously an arbitrary basis for communication.
We could pick a different specific word say from a different human language
but still communicate the same thing. All that's required is that everyone
who's using the word agrees on its meaning
and presumably that normally happens because of shared social history
between people who use a given word. It's worth pointing out that for this to
work there has to be a certain separation of scales.
The collective impression of the meaning of a word may change over time
but that change has to be slow compared to the rate at which the word is used
in actual communication. In effect the meaning of a word as
we humans might understand it emerges from the aggregation of many individual
uses. In the abstract there might not be any
reason to think that there'd be a way to understand words consistently
but it's a story very much like what we've encountered in both physics and
mathematics even though there are lots of complicated
individual details underneath we as observers managed to pick out
features that are simple enough for us to understand.
In the case of molecules in a gas that might be the overall pressure of a gas
in the case of words it's a stable notion of meaning.
Put another way the possibility of language is another example of observer
theory at work. Inside our brains there are all sorts of
complicated neuron firings but somehow these can be packaged up
into things like words that form human level narratives.
There's a certain complicated feedback loop between the world as we experience
it and the words we use to describe it. We invent words for things that we
commonly encounter chair table and so on yet once we have a word for something
we're more able to form thoughts about it or communicate about it
and that in turn makes us more likely to put instances of it in our
environment. In other words we tend to build our
environment so that we have ways of making narratives about it
that work well or in effect so that our inner description of it
can be as simple as possible and that it can be as predictable to us as
possible. We can view our experience of
physics and mathematics as being the result of us acting as physical
observers or mathematical observers now we're viewing our experience of the
conceptual universe as being the result of us acting as
conceptual observers but what's crucial is that in all these
cases we have the same intrinsic features as observers.
Computational boundedness and a belief in persistence.
The computational boundedness is what makes us equivalence things
to the point where we can have symbolic descriptions of the world for
example in terms of words and the belief in persistence
is what lets those words have persistent meanings.
And actually these ideas extend beyond just language to paradigms
and general ways of thinking about things. When we define a word we're in
effect defining an abstraction for a class of things
and paradigms are somehow a generalization of this. Ways of taking
lots of specifics and coming up with a uniform framework for them.
When we do this we're in effect making a classic observer theory move
and equivalencing lots of different things to produce an internal impression
that's simple enough to fit in our finite minds.
In the end it's all just the Ruliad. Our tendency as observers is always to believe that we can separate
our inner experience from what's going on in the outside world but in the end
everything is just part of the Ruliad and at the level of the Ruliad we as
observers are ultimately made of the same stuff as everything else.
But we can imagine can we imagine that we can point at one part of the Ruliad and
say that's an observer and another part and say that's not.
At least to some extent the answer is presumably yes at least if we restrict
ourselves to observers like us. But it's a somewhat subtle and seemingly
circular story. For example one core feature of observers
like us is that we have a certain persistence or at least we believe we
have a certain persistence. But inevitably at the level of the
Ruliad we're continually being made of different atoms of existence i.e.
different Eames. So in what sense are we persistent?
Well the point is that an observer can equivalence those different successive
patterns of Eames so that what they observe
is persistent. And yes this is at least on the face of it circular and
ultimately to identify what parts of the Ruliad might be persistent enough to
be observers will have to ground the circularity
in some kind of further assumption. What about the computational boundedness
of observers like us which forces us to do lots of equivalencing?
At some level that equivalencing must be implemented by lots of different states
evolving to the same states. But once again there's circularity because
even to define what we mean by the same states
our isomorphic graphs the same and so on we have to be imagining
certain equivalencing. So how do we break out of the circularity?
The key is presumably the presence of additional features that define observers
like us. And one important class of such features
has to do with scale. We're neither tiny nor huge.
We involve enough Eames that consistent averages can emerge
yet we don't involve so many Eames that we span anything but an absolutely tiny
part of the whole Ruliad. And actually a lot of our experience
is determined by our size as observers. We're large enough that certain
equivalencing is inevitable yet we're small enough that we can reasonably
think of there being many choices for where we are.
The overall structure of the Ruliad is a matter of formal necessity.
There's only one possible way for it to be. But there's contingency in our
character as observers and for example in a sense
there's a fundamental constant of nature as we perceive it
which is our extent in the Ruliad say measured in Eames
and appropriately projected into physical space, branched space and so on.
And the fact that this extent is small compared to the whole Ruliad
means that there are many possible observers who can think of existing at
different positions in the Ruliad and those different observers
will look at the Ruliad from different points of view and thus develop
different internal impressions of perceived reality.
But a crucial fact central to our physics project is that there are certain
aspects of that perceived reality that are inevitable
for observers like us and that correspond to the core laws of physics.
But when it gets to more specific questions, what does the night sky look
like from where you are and so on, different observers will inevitably
have different versions of perceived reality.
So is there a way to translate from one observer to another?
Essentially that's a story of motion. What happens when an observer that's at
one place in the Ruliad moves to another place?
Inevitably the observer we made of different Eames if it's at a different
place but it will somehow but will it somehow still be the same?
Well that's a subtle question that depends both on the background structure
of the Ruliad and the nature of the observer.
If the Ruliad is too wild, think near space time and near a singularity,
then the observer will inevitably be shredded as it moves.
But computational irreducibility implies a certain overall regularity
to most of the Ruliad making pure motion at least conceivable.
But to achieve pure motion the observer still has to be made of something
that is somehow robust, essentially some lump of computational reducibility
that can predictably survive the underlying background of computational
irreducibility. In space time we can identify such
lumps with things like black holes and particles like electrons, photons and so
on and yes in our models there's probably considerable
commonality between black holes and particles.
It's not yet clear quite what the analog is in Braunschild space though a very
simple example might involve persistence of qubits.
And in Rulial space one kind of analog is the very notion of concepts.
For an effect concepts as represented for example by words
are the analog of particles in Rulial space. They are the robust structures
that can move across Rulial space and maintain their identity
carrying the same thoughts to different minds.
So what does all this mean for what can constitute observer in the Ruliad?
Observers in effect leverage computational reducibility
to extract simplified features that can fit in finite minds.
But observers themselves must also embody computational reducibility
in order to maintain their own persistence and the persistence of the
features they extract. Or in other words observers must in a
sense always correspond to patches of regularity in the Ruliad.
But can any patch of regularity in the Ruliad be thought of as an observer?
Probably not usefully so because another feature of observers like us
is that we're connected in some kind of collective social framework.
Not only do we individually form internal impressions in our minds
but we also communicate these impressions and indeed without such
communication we wouldn't for example be able to set up things like
coherent languages with which to describe things.
What do we assume about ourselves? A key implication of our physics project
from the concept of the Ruliad is that we perceive the universe to be the way we
do because we are the way we are as observers.
And the most fundamental aspect of observers like us
is that we're doing lots of equivalencing to reduce the complexity of the world
to internal impressions that fit in our minds.
But just what kinds of equivalencing are we actually doing?
At some level a lot of that is defined by the things we believe or assume
about ourselves and the way we interact with the world.
A very central assumption we make is that we're somehow stable observers
of a changing outside world. Of course at some level
we're actually not stable at all. We're made up from different aims whose
configurations whose configuration is changing all the time.
But our belief in our own stability and in effect our belief in our persistence
in time makes us equivalence to those configurations.
And having done that equivalencing we perceive the universe to operate in a
certain way that turns out to align with the laws of physics we know.
But actually there's more than just our assumption of persistence in time.
For example we also have an assumption of our persistence in space.
We assume that at least on reasonably short time scales we're consistently
observing the universe from the same place and not say
continually darting around. The network that represents space is
continually changing around us. But we're equivalence things so that we
can assume that in a first approximation we are staying in the same
place. Of course we don't believe that we
have to stay exactly the same place and exactly the same place all the time.
We believe we're able to move and here we make what amounts to another
assumption of stability. We assume that pure motion is possible
for us as observers. In other words we assume that we can go to
different places and still be the same us with the same properties as
observers. At the level of the Royal Rulliard
it's not at all obvious that such an assumption
that such assumptions can be consistently made.
But as we discussed before the fact that for observers like us
they can at least to a good approximation do this as a reflection of
certain properties of us as observers in particular of our physical scale
being large in terms of atoms of space but small
in terms of the whole universe. Related to our assumption about motion
is our assumption that space exists or that we can treat space as something
coherent. Underneath there's all sorts of complicated
dynamics of changing patterns of eames but on the time scales at which we
experience things we can equivalence these patterns
to allow us to think of space as having a coherent structure.
And once again the fact that we can do this as a consequence of the physical
scales associated with us as observers in particular the speed of light is fast
enough that it brings information to us from the local region around us
in much less time than it takes our brain to process it.
And this means that we can equivalence all the different ways in which
different pieces of information reach us and we can consistently just talk about
the state of a region of space at a given time.
Part of our assumption that we're persistent in time
is that our threat of experience is at least locally continuous with no breaks.
Yes we're born and we die and we also sleep but we assume that at least on
scales relevant for our ongoing perception of the world
we experience time as something continuous. More than that
we assume that we have just a single thread of experience
or in other words that there's always just one us going through time.
Of course even at the level of neurons in our brains all sorts of activity goes
on in parallel but somehow in our normal psychological state
we seem to concentrate everything so that our inner experience follows just
one thread of history on which we can operate in a
computationally bounded way and form definite memories and have
definite sequences of thoughts. We're not as familiar with branch
shield spaces with physical space but presumably our fundamental assumption
of stability extends there as well and when combined with our basic
computational boundedness then becomes inevitable that as we talked
about before we'll conflate different quantum parts of history
to give us observers a definite classical thread of inner experience.
Beyond stability another very important assumption we implicitly make about
ourselves is what amounts to an assumption of independence.
We imagine that we can somehow separate ourselves off from everything else
and one aspect of this is that we assume one aspect of this we assume we're
localized and that most of the rulliad doesn't matter to us so that we can
equivalence all the different states of the rest of the rulliad
but there's also another aspect of independence
then in fact we can choose to do whatever we want
independent of the rest of the universe and this means that we assume
that we can for example essentially do any possible experiment
make any possible measurement or go anywhere we want in physical or branch
field space or indeed rullial space. We assume that we effectively have free
will about these things determined only by our inner choices
and independent of the state of the rest of the universe.
Ultimately of course we're just part of the rulliad and everything we do is
determined by the structure of the rulliad and our history within it
but we can view our belief of freedom as a reflection of the fact that we don't
know a priori where we'll be located in the rulliad
and even if we did computational irreducibility would prevent us from
making predictions about what we will do.
Beyond our assumptions about our own independence from the rest of the
universe there's also the questions of end
question of independence between different parts of what we observe
and quite central to our way of processing the world
is our typical assumption that we can think about different things separately.
In other words we assume it's possible to factor what we see happening
in the universe into independent parts. In science this manifests itself
in the idea that we can do controlled experiments in which we study how
something behaves in isolation from everything else.
It's not self-evident that this will be possible and indeed in some areas like
ethics it might be fundamentally not be but we as observers tend to
implicitly assume it and actually we normally go much
further because we typically assume that we can describe and think about the
world symbolically. In other words we assume that we can
take all the complexity of the world and represent at least the parts of what we
care about in terms of discrete symbolic concepts of the kind that
appear in human or computational language. There's lots of detail in the
world that our limited collection of symbolic concepts doesn't capture
and effectively equivalence is out but the point is that it's this symbolic
description that normally seems to form the backbone
of the inner narrative we have about the world.
There's another implicit assumption that's being made here however and that's
that there's some kind of stability in the symbolic concepts we're using.
Yes any particular mind might force the world using a particular set of symbolic
concepts but we make the implicit assumption that there are other minds
out there that work like ours and this makes us imagine that there can be
some form of objective reality that's just
always out there to be sampled by whatever mind might happen to come along.
Not only therefore do we assume our own stability as observers we also assume a
certain stability to what we perceive of everything that's out there.
Underneath there's all the wildness and complexity of the Ruliad but we assume
that we can successfully equivalence things to the point where all we
perceive is something quite stable and something we can
describe as ultimately governed by consistent laws.
It could be that every part of the universe just does its own thing
with no overall laws tying everything together
but we make the implicit assumption that no the universe at least as far as we
perceive it is a more organized and consistent place
and indeed it's that assumption that makes it feasible for us to operate as
observers like us at all and even to imagine
that we can usefully reduce the complexity of the world
to something that fits in our finite minds.
The cost of observation. What resources does it take for an observer to make an
observation? In most of traditional science observation
is at best added as an afterthought and no account is taken
of the process by which it occurs and indeed for example in the traditional
formalism of quantum mechanics while measurement can have an effect on a
system it's still assumed to be an indivisible
act without any internal process. But in observer theory we're centrally
talking about the process of observation and so it makes sense to
try asking questions about the resources involved in this process.
We might start with our own everyday experience. Something happens out in the
world. What resources and for example how much
time does it take for us to form an impression of it?
Let's say that out in the world a cat either comes into view or it doesn't.
There are signals that come to our brain from our eyes
effectively carrying data on each pixel in our visual field.
Then inside our brain these signals are processed by a succession
of layers of neurons with us in the end concluding
either that there is a cat there or there's not.
And from artificial neural nets we can get a pretty good idea of how this
likely works and the key to it as we talked about before
is that there's an attractor. Lots of different detailed configurations of
pixels all evolve to the same cat or no cat final state.
The different configurations have been equivalenced so that only a final
conclusion survives. The story is a bit trickier though
because cat or no cat really isn't the final state of our brain.
Hopefully it's not the last thought we have. Instead our brain will continue to
think more thoughts. So cat or no cat is a best some kind of
intermediate waypoint in our process of thinking.
An instantaneous conclusion that will continue to build on.
And indeed when we consider measuring devices like a piston measuring the
pressure of a gas we similarly usually imagine that they will come to an
instantaneous conclusion but continue operating and producing more data.
But how long should we wait for each individual conclusion?
How long for example will it take for the stressors generated by a particular
pattern of molecules hitting a piston to dissipate out
and for the piston to be ready to produce more data?
There are lots of specific questions of physics here but if our purpose is to
build a formal observer theory how should we think about such things?
There is something of analogy in the formal theory of computation.
An actual computational system say in the physical world will just keep
computing but in formal computation theory it's useful to talk about
computations that halt and about functions that can be evaluated
and give a definite answer. So what's the analog of this an observer theory?
Instead of general computations we're interested in computations that
effectively implement equivalences or put another way we want
computations that destroy information that have many incoming states but few
outgoing states. As a practical matter we can either
have the outgoing states explicitly represent whole equivalence classes
or they can just be canonical representation
representatives like in a network where at each step each element
takes on whatever the majority or consensus value of its neighbors was
but however it works we can still ask questions about what the
computational resources were that were involved.
How many steps did it take? How many elements were involved?
And with the idea that observers like us are computationally bounded
we expect limitations on these resources but with this formal setup we can
start asking just how far an observer like us can get
saying coming to a conclusion about the results of some computationally
irreducible process. An interesting case arises in putative
quantum computers in the model implied by a physics project
such a quantum computer effectively performs many computations in parallel
on the separate branches of a multi-way system representing the various threads
of history of the universe. But if the observer tries to come to a
conclusion about what actually happened they have to
knit together all those threads of history in effect by
implementing equivalences between them.
One could in principle imagine an observer who just follow all the quantum
branches but it wouldn't be an observer like us
because what seems like a core feature of observers like us
is that we believe we have just a single thread of experience
and to maintain that belief our process of observation
must equivalence all the different quantum branches.
How much effort will that be? Well inevitably if a threat of history
branched our equivalencing has to undo that branching
and that suggests that the number of elementary equivalence things will have
to be at least comparable to the number of elementary
branchings making it seem that the effort of observation
will tend to be at least comparable to reduction
that the will tend to be at least comparable to the reduction of effort
associated with parallelism in the underlying quantum process.
Actually I have to say I wonder
the in general it's interesting to compare this sort of
effort of observation with the effort of computation.
With our concept of elementary equivalence things we have a way to
measure both in terms of computational operations and yes both could in
principle be implemented by something like a Turing machine
but in practice the equivalence things might be more most conveniently
modeled by something more like string rewriting.
And indeed one can often go much further talking not directly in terms of
equivalence things but rather about processes that show attractors.
There are different kinds of attractors sometimes like in class one cellular
automata there's just a limited number of static fixed
global fixed points say either all cells black or all cells white
but in other cases like such as class three cellular automata
the number of output states may be smaller than number of input states
but there may be no computationally simple characterization of them.
Observers like us though mostly seem to make use of the fixed points.
We try to symbolize the world taking all the complexities out there
and reducing them to discrete conclusions that we might for example
describe using the discrete words in a language.
There's an immediate subtlety associated with attractors of any time though.
Typical physics is reversible in the sense that any process say two molecules
scattering from each other can run equally well forwards and backwards
but in an attractor one goes from lots of possible initial states
to a smaller number of attractor final states.
And there are two basic ways this can happen even when there's underlying
reversibility. First the systems on studying can be open
in the sense that effects can radiate out of the region that one's studying
and seconds the states the system gets into can be complicated enough
that say a computationally bounded observer will inevitably equivalence
them and indeed that's the main thing that's happening for example
when a system reaches them an dynamic equilibrium as described by the second
law. And actually once again there's often a
certain circularity one is trying to determine whether an observer has
finished observing and come to a conclusion
but one needs an observer to make that determination.
Can we tell if we finished forming a thought or we have to think about it
in effect by forming another thought? Put another way
imagine we're trying to determine whether a piston has come to a conclusion
about pressure and a gas particularly if there's microscopic
reversibility the piston and things around it will continue
wiggling around and it will take an observer to determine whether the
heat is dissipated to the point where one can read out the result.
How do we break out of what seems like an infinite regress?
The point is that whatever mind is ultimately forming the impression
that is the observation is inevitably the final arbiter
and yes this could mean that we'd always have to start discussing all sorts of
things about photoreceptors and neurons and so on
but as we've discussed before at some length the key point
that makes the general observer theory possible is that there are many conclusions
that can be drawn for large classes of observers independent of these
details. But okay what happens if we think
about the rule rule we add? Now we have all the
eems and elementary events updating and updating
updating events for configurations of them in a sense
we're fishing out of this pieces that represent observers and pieces that
represent things they're observing. Can we assess the cost of observation
there? It really depends on the fundamental
scale of what we consider to be observers in fact we might even think of our
scale as observers say measured in eems or elementary events
as defining a fundamental constant of nature at least for the universe as we
perceive it. But given this scale we can for example
ask for that to develop consensus across it or at least for every e-minute
to have had time to communicate with every other.
In an attempt to formalize the cost of observation
we'll inevitably have to make what seem like arbitrary choices
just as we were in setting up a scheme to determine
when an outgoing computational process has generated an answer
but if we sorry an ongoing computational process has generated an answer
but if we assume a certain boundedness in our choices we can expect that we'll be
able to draw definite conclusions and in effect be able to construct an analog
of computational complexity theory for processes of observation.
Well what's the future of observer theory?
Well my goal in this essay is to explore some of the key concepts and principles
needed to create a framework that we can call observer theory.
What I've done so far is just the beginning and there's much
still to be done in fleshing out the theory and investigating its
implications. One important place to start is a
making more explicit models of the mechanics of observation at the
level of the general theory it's all about equivalencing but how
specifically is that equivalencing achieved in particular cases there are
many thousands of kinds of sensors, measuring devices, analysis methods
and so on. All of these should be systematically
inventoryed and classified and in each case there's a meta model to be made
that clarifies just how equivalencing is achieved and for example what
separation of physical or other scales makes it possible.
Human experience and human minds are the inspiration and ultimate grounding
for our concept of an observer and insofar as neural nets trained on what
amounts to human experience have emerged as somewhat faithful models for
what human minds do we can expect to use them as a fairly
detailed proxy for observers like us. So for example we can imagine exploring
things like quantum observers by studying multi-way generalizations
of neural nets and this is something that becomes easier
if instead of organizing the data in neural nets into a real number weights
we can atomize neural nets into purely discrete elements.
Well such investigations of potentially realistic models provide a useful
practical grounding for observer theory but to develop a general observer
theory we need a more formal notion of an observer
and there is no doubt a whole abstract framework perhaps using methods from
areas like category theory that can be developed purely on the basis of our
concept of observers being about equivalencing.
But to understand the connection of observer theory to things like science
as done by us humans we need to tighten up what it means to be an
observer like us. What exactly are all the general
things that we believe about ourselves as we discussed above
many many we take us we so much take for granted that it's
challenging for us to identify them as actually just beliefs
that in principle don't have to be that way.
But I suspect that the more we tighten up our definition of observers like us
the more we will be able to explain why we perceive the world the way we do
and attribute to it the laws and properties we do. Is there some feature
of observers like us for example that makes us parse the physical world
as being three-dimensional? We could represent the same data
about what's out there by assigning one-dimensional kind of space filling
coordinate to everything but somehow observers like us don't do that
and instead we effectively probe the rule ad
by sampling it in what we perceive as three-dimensional slices
and yes the most obvious coarse-graining just considers progressively larger GDC
balls say in the spatial hypergraph that appear in our physics project
but that's probably at best an approximation to the sampling that
observers like us do. As part of our physics project we've
discovered that the structure of the three main theories of 20th century
physics just on mechanics general relativity and quantum mechanics
can be derived from properties of the rule ad just by knowing that observers
like us are computationally bounded and believe we're persistent in time
but how might we reach say the standard model of particle physics with all its
particular values of parameters and so on some may be inevitable
given the underlying structure of our theory but others one suspects are in
effect reflections of aspects of us as observers
they are derivable but only given our particular characteristics or beliefs
as observers and yes presumably things like the constant
of nature that characterizes our size in eames will appear in the
laws we attribute to the universe as we perceive it
and by the way these considerations of observers like us extend beyond physical
observers so for example as we tighten up our
characterization of what we're like as mathematical observers
we can expect that this will constrain the possible laws of the mathematical
universe we might have thought that we could pick
whatever axioms we want in effect sampling the rule ad to get any
mathematics we want but presumably observers like us can't do this
so the questions like is the continuum hypothesis true
can potentially have definite answers for any observers like us
and for any coherent mathematics that we build
but in the end do we really have to consider observers whose characteristics
are grounded in human experience we already reflexively generalize our
own personal experiences to those of other humans
can we go further we don't have the internal experience of being a dog
an ant colony a computer or an ocean and typically
at best we anthropomorphize such things trying to reduce the behavior we
perceive in them to elements that align with our own human experience
but are we as humans just stuck with a particular kind of internal experience
the growth of technology in a particular sensors and measuring devices
has certainly expanded the range of inputs that can be delivered to our
brains and the growth of our collective knowledge
about the world has expanded our ways of representing and
thinking about things right now those are basically our only
ways of modifying our detailed internal experience
but what if we were to connect directly and internally into our brains
presumably at least at first we need the kind of neural user interface to be
familiar and we be forced into for example
concentrating everything into a single thread of experience
but what if we allowed multi-way experience well of course our brains
already made up of billions of neurons that each do
that each do things but it seems to be a core feature of human
experience that we concentrate those things to give us a single
thread of experience and that seems to be to be an essential
feature of being an observer like us that kind of concentration also happens
in a flock of birds or an ant colony or a human society
in all of these cases each individual organism does their thing
but somehow collective decisions get made with many different detailed
situations getting equivalents together to leave only the final decision
so that means that from the outside the system behaves as we would expect
of an observer like us internally that kind of observer behavior
is happening above the experience of each single individual
but still at the level of the hive mind it's behavior typical and of an
observer like us that's not to say though that we can
readily imagine what it's like to be a system like this or even to be one of
its parts and the effort to explore a berber theory
an important direction is to try to imagine ourselves having a different
kind of experience than we do and from within that experience
try to see what kinds of laws we would attribute say to the physical universe
in the early 20th century particularly in the context of relativity and
quantum mechanics it became clear that being more realistic about the
observer was crucial in moving forward in science
things like computational irreducibility and even more so our physics project
take that another step when used to imagine that science should be
somehow be fundamentally objective and independent of all aspects of the
observer but what's become clear is that it's not
and that the nature of us as observers is actually crucial in determining what
science we experience but the crucial point is that
there are often powerful conclusions that can be drawn
even without knowing all the details of an observer
and that's a central reason for building a general observer theory
in effect to give an objective way of formally and robustly
characterizing what one might consider to be the subjective elements of science
all right and that's what i wrote in my essay
so if people have questions or comments i'd be happy to
try to take those
lots of things
uh
from david what are the computational rules of
observation how do you get from bits of space
to bits of meaning well
the the question is what's sort of underneath
the physical universe how do we and how does that relate to
formal systems and places where we can discuss questions like meaning
and the whole point of what we've done with the idea of the rulliad
is that it is a formal structure that is both beneath
physical space and beneath the abstract systems we can construct
i mean this is a complicated question and it sort of relates to
questions like why does physical space exist why does the universe exist
and i think my answer to that which i'm very surprised as possible to give
is the rule the rulliad inevitably exists once you have a definition of
terms it is inevitable that the rulliad exists
and has the structure it has just like we can define you know
one plus ones and pluses and we can conclude that one plus one equals two
just as a necessary feature of the definition of ones and pluses and things
so similarly the rulliad necessarily has the structure it has
now the question of why the rulliad is actualized
as something where it's the universe where we can pick things up and do things
to them and so on the thing to realize is that in a sense the
surprises that we exist the the rulliad necessarily
exists the fact that there is an entity like us
that has an inner experience of some aspects of the rulliad that's not so
obvious and uh although we can argue that that
so that that's a thing that you sort of have to
scientifically derive that that there can be entities like us and
many copies of entities like us and we can build this whole thing with many
minds that think they're all doing the same kinds of things
that's something that as a matter of kind of science
you can say why is it like that but the fact that there is
something rather than nothing is inevitable because it is a purely
formal thing but our our experience of that thing is it's
it's still as perfectly real to us as anything else
because we are as abstract as we as it is it's not like we're saying
there's there's us that form abstract thoughts
and then there's a a thing out there that is hard physical reality
the hard physical reality is made of the same abstract stuff
as those thoughts that we're internally generating
so that's a that's a an approach to a pretty difficult philosophical
issue um but that's a a little bit of an attempt at that
um
Kenneth says are you saying there are no discrete objects everything is connected
there's just sort of oneness uh of quantum fields
in some sense yes the Ruliad is the single object
that connects everything that that is um and
when we parse it we absolutely parse it as separate different things we we say
there's this electron here and there's another electron there
but in the end those electrons are made of
the same atoms of existence and there are there's this sort of elaborate set of
connections between those atoms of existence
defined by the processes of computation that build up the Ruliad
denial asks who observes the observer
well that's some as I was saying there are a bunch of different sort of
definitions of observers and how observers work and so on
that do require an observer observing the observer
and I suppose that the experience we have we have an inner experience each one
of us has an inner experience but we observe other people
who we assume have the same kinds of inner experiences
so that's a case of sort of observing the observer
and I think this very fact that we assume that different
people have similar kinds of internal experiences
is kind of the thing that closes the loop of sort of this question
about who observes the observer so to speak it's a
it's a very intrinsic assumption that we have might not be true
but it's an intrinsic assumption that we have that I think
for us sort of closes that loop
chumbles asks does computational boundedness lead to unpredictability
thanks to chaos theory well that's complicated so
I mean the idea of chaos theory is that a small change
in the initial conditions for a system will eventually expand to be a large
change of behavior so the the case where let's say you
have an array of cells discrete cells and you just flip
one bit you change one of those initial cells
what will often happen is that the the the evolutions the results that you get
from evolving with one one flip of that bit
you compare that with the evolution you get from the other flip of that bit
and they'll get progressively more and more different so for example
the the kind of the change associated with flipping that bit
might initially be just localized to that bit then it will expand to be three
bits five bits etc it will expand out to more and more bits
that's kind of the essence of this chaos theory idea
is that you can't know what's going to happen unless you know
every precise detail of the initial conditions unless you know every bit in
the initial condition because flipping any one bit will eventually affect all
the other bits now it's a bit confusing in the way chaos
theory is often really talked about because it originated
beginning of the 20th century and was kind of really
emphasized in in the 1970s and so on the 19 beginning of the 1980s
in the idea that if you have real numbers if you have
decimal numbers 1.758264 etc etc etc then the same phenomenon that I
mentioned changing one bit can have an effect on the answer
that also happens if you change a bit far far down in the number so you know
the coefficient of of 10 to the minus 100 or something in the number
the hundredth bit in the number a hundredth digit in the number
change that eventually the effect of that will get amplified up
to have an effect on the whole behavior of the system
it's actually exactly the same phenomenon as one's talking about
but sort of changing the this spatial spread
of some effect it's the same phenomenon it looks confusingly different in the
mathematics because of things to do with the way that people
think about real numbers and so on it's sort of a pre computational way of
thinking about things a thing where you're thinking about
kind of just math just happens rather than there have to be rules by which you
derive every successive step in the math that you're generating
so the this question about the relationship between sort of the
spreading of information that is the that is the relevant as
opposed to rather confusing aspect of chaos theory
how does that relate to computational boundedness and unpredictability
yes there is I think a relation in the sense that
if you have if you are well let's see there's a relation but it's not the
whole story the relation is if you are sort of
a bounded computational entity sensitive to only a particular part of
what's happening in the world then yes in so far as effects can spread from
outside that region to inside that region that will be a reason why you
can't predict what's going to happen but the more important effect I think
most of the time is that even within that region
there are processes going on that you can't readily predict there are
irreducible processes going on even within that region
that you can't readily predict even independent of the rate at which things
are flowing in from the out from outside that region
it's kind of like the following thing if you imagine a bunch of molecules and
they're they're doing their thing in some particular system
there's a certain rate at which the effect of essentially heat
sort of random motion of molecules knocking those molecules
from the outside knocking around those molecules that the extent to which that
happens that's kind of the flow of outside stuff
into your system versus kind of what's happening intrinsic to the system now
for example in quantum computing what the big issue is
can you prevent that sort of heat from the outside
in messing with the qubits that you're so carefully setting up and looking at
so that's a case where sort of computational irreducibility within the
system you try very hard to isolate the system
and not have effects flow in from the outside but yes
computational boundedness and and the comparative infinity of the world
is a form that that will lead to certain kinds of unpredictability
as the effect of sort of the outside of the world
gets into what's happening on the inside but I think that's a tends to be a much
slower effect than the internal effect of
kind of the the sort of computational processes
within the system itself not things that you hadn't considered to be part of
the system and and obviously one one thing one
might think of is come on come on isolate the system come on close it up
and and that's a lot of what one tries to do when one has sort of stable qubits
in quantum computing and things like this
prab asks can we confidently say where we are in the rulliad
well a challenging thing is to coordinate as the rulliad I mean like
like where are we in space you know I I was just
you know where are we it's like we say well we're here on the earth
and we can set up coordinate systems and we could say we're at certain latitude
longitude on the earth okay where's the earth
well it's going around the sun we can set up a coordinate system for the
solar system that's anchored at the center of mass of the
solar system or at the center of the sun and we can say this is where we are
relative to the center of the sun and so on okay where are we in the galaxy
well there is a a somewhat more elaborate galactic coordinate system
that's been made up as a matter of convention that allows us to say where
we are in the galaxy where are we in the universe
it's a pretty arbitrary thing to set up that coordinate system and describe
where we are I mean we could say we're part of this
supercluster that we've named this particular thing
but you know that coordinate system is a very arbitrary thing to put down
now it's an interesting question how do we coordinate our branch ill space
how do we coordinateize the rulliard do we have a way of naming
the coordinate positions in the rulliard we do not
not yet I mean just like we don't have a way of
absolutely naming where the earth is or our galaxy is in the universe
now you can say we're here and we can say how far away is this thing so for
example I did this study of generative AI looking at
kind of different sort of concepts that can be generated
like I was looking at you know cat island the concepts that are in
in meaning space and the latent space of the generative AI
that are near the concept of a cat or the concept of a dog
and there's a huge volume of inter concept space analogous to interstellar
space between the things we have defined as human
concepts and we can ask questions like if you go
from cats to dogs that defines a vector a direction
the cat to dog direction you can keep going in that direction you can see what
you got find out there but co-ordinatizing something
like the rulliard is complicated and we certainly don't know how to do it I
mean if we say you know let's put down where certain
minds are in the rulliard we've got to different different people let's say
who exist as different minds which are effectively like points in the rulliard
interesting question how are we co-ordinateized in rullial space
you know in a sense minds that are more aligned are going to be closer in
rullial space but what's the direction you know if we go from
from you know Jim to Jane and we keep going
do we get to Bob after a while in rullial space
we don't know any of that we don't know how to think about yet
these kinds of of co-ordinateizations we don't know
if we look at we we have certain ways of of embedding for example words
in in meaning spaces and so on and we can ask you know if you start from the
word rhinoceros and you go to to antelope and you keep
going what what what do you get to the space is not flat enough
that that's a terribly meaningful question but that's the type of thing
that one would do if one was sort of co-ordinateizing
something like the rulliard
Dr. Evil asks is the multi-way graph method
based on everettian quantum mechanics so this kind of many worlds
quantum mechanics idea is somewhat but not terribly related I think
it's always difficult you know I spend a bunch of effort kind of doing history
of science trying to understand kind of how
different ideas are fitted together I have not worked on
questions about the ideas of quantum mechanics and how they're fitted together
I have worked on the case of the second door of thermodynamics
which turns out to be a very complicated 200-year story
about how different ideas were fitted together and how different confusions
occurred and how people assume different things and so on
but so I don't know this as well as I as I might like to
but I think one of the big differences is that
this notion of us being extended observers in branch shield space is very
different in traditional many worlds quantum mechanics it's like
there's a single thread of existence that we exist on
but if we are if we're looking at this whole branch shield space of all these
different ends of different sort of parts of
history laid out in the space the the idea in our
models is that we are extended objects in branch shield space just like we're
extended objects in physical space I think that's rather different
I think also that the idea that happens in multi-way graphs in general
that you can have mergers of paths as well as branching of paths
is another different thing I think that may have been something that was in
Everett's original work but didn't survive in in interpretations of that
work so that's my that's my rough impression I think
that the like many of the things from mathematical physics
my guess is that there and I think people have already done this
that there are sort of results and mathematical results and things from
from many worlds quantum mechanics that can be imported into thinking about our
physics project and given the sort of understanding from our physics project
you can then export that to some of these other areas
but I don't know in detail what's been done there
Eren says
this might be related to a different thing these stereo vision formulas to
capture imagery and map the shapes I think that's not related to this
this live stream um
let's see moon asks are you kind of defining the axioms of
Einstein's observer in special relativity okay that's an interesting point
you know Einstein made a set of essentially logical
assumptions in his 1905 paper on special relativity
you know there's nothing that goes faster than light different observers and
different reference frames uh sort of perceived the same physics and so on
I am I think it's very likely that it's possible
to derive our results about our physics project
and our models of the of reality on the basis of a similar kind of philosophical
abstract axiomatic structure the difference is only this
Einstein was able to go from that set of kind of axiomatic assumptions
very easily to a mathematical framework that allowed him to derive things quite
precisely for us that framework is
considerably more complicated I mean the the
just the structure of these kinds of computational things
is much less we didn't luck out it's not a simple math so to speak as it was
for Einstein just simple formulas and things
what we're dealing with is something that is to us
much more difficult to deal with there's a there's a whole chunk of
computational irreducibility there which is an issue that Einstein didn't
happen to have I mean as a matter of fact there's a piece of
history 1905 Einstein wrote three spectacular papers one of
which was about special relativity they were all papers
that in a sense was sort of here's a logical way of thinking about the world
here's its consequences and it connects to math
in the three years before 1905 Einstein had written I think three papers
about a different subject a subject that I've been very interested in which is
the derivation of the second law of thermodynamics
the derivation of the law of entropy increase
Einstein thought he had proved that law he was wrong
he had a similar kind of logical structure of let's put down these axioms
about heat engines and things like this and from them prove the second law of
thermodynamics they were all they were all misses it
didn't work but then he turned the same kinds of
thinking to special relativity to the to the idea of
photons to how Brownian motion works and bingo on all of them it worked
perfectly so and in fact so it's a case where in a
sense the thing that Einstein didn't succeed on with that type of thinking
was exactly the thing that now I think we finally a hundred years later
120 years later been able to be successful with
and but it requires this kind of raft of other
of other ideas about computational irreducibility computation in general
principle of computational equivalence a lot of other kinds of things
to to actually technically get to that point and actually
you know I guess old Albert was was a was a smart cookie and in fact
1916 the year after he invented general relativity the theory of
of of spacetime the and gravity and so on
he wrote some letter to somebody in which he said in the end it will turn out
that spacetime is discrete the spacetime that he assumed was this
continuous sort of calculus accessible spacetime
in the end spacetime he said will turn out to be discrete
but we do not yet have the methods necessary to analyze how that will work
which he was completely correct about those methods required this whole
seem to have required this kind of whole tower of ideas
about computation and so on and it took a hundred years for us to have those
methods but now we do and now we're in a position to
actually talk about these things in a in a meaningful way
but so it would be very nice to be able to formulate the things I'm talking
about in terms of in a sense like you can make this logical
point make that logical point then make this conclusion
it won't probably work quite as nice as it did for Einstein
because because of the fact that he happened to have
sort of low hanging mathematical fruit to pick
to to describe the world given those those axiomatic assumptions
we don't for us it's more complicated it's things like saying the observer is
computationally bounded the universe is computationally irreducible
so certain things follow from that and yes we can absolutely say that
but to say and the answer is 1 over square root of 1 minus v squared over c
squared we won't get quite as nice and simple formula
we won't get to get to the point where we have formulas we have to do a lot more
work and and it's a different different kind of thing
um
uh jh says Lenny Susskind has described an
observation as an entanglement um gosh you know this is always
very bad you you you know the only real way
and this is kind of a a rural space comment the only real way
that to to untangle whether what person a says
what person b says how they're related is at best
to watch the interactive communication between person a and person b
i i don't i mean yes gosh i mean quantum measurements are related to
entanglements and there's a whole formalism for that
um i don't i don't know exactly what this what this particular
idea is um let's see the uh
uh
a couple more things and then i have to go back to my
day job here um krab asks is analysis our best bet to transfer an
observation between two observers in a lossless fashion
i think our best bet is probably computational language
or mathematical language it's a formal description
that sort of both is an interesting question i mean that
both observers can be kind of educated to think of in the
same way i mean human language is partly of that
kind but there's a lot less kind of you know although it creates all kinds of
social issues but there's a lot less kind of certainty about
you say this word and i say this word do we mean the same thing by that word
that's something where there is less you know that becomes a social question of
whether we mean the same thing by those words and i would say that in
in mathematics or in computational language the
particularly in computational language do you mean the same thing by those
words there is a hard definition of meaning because in the end the
computational language is executed and it does the computer
does a definite thing and so that's uh that's a place in which
you can um uh you can kind of nail down that really
means the same thing so i would say that actually probably it's a good point i
mean that computational language and our whole wolfman language stack that i
just spent the last 40 years building um that that really is the
best example of a lossless way of communicating ideas
from one observer to another because it is something where there is a
a definition and you know there is a a clear meaning to it because it's how
it executes and and yet as humans we can start
trying to two different humans can try to sort of separately understand
what that uh kind of um uh can can sort of separately understand those
things and they can both be attached to the same meaning
let's see uh
memes is asking how should observers like us consider scientific measurements
i think the point about measurements is that
we are trying to take certain things into our internal experience
and what there are different kinds of things we can measure
if we don't have an electronic amplifier we can't measure small
small effects that are electrically represented if we don't have a
microscope we can't see very small things
that's uh those are the you know in a sense
the that scientific measurements provide and the and the sensors and
measuring devices we have provide a way of extending our own
built-in biological sensors to have a broader domain
of of of access to the world and i think the same is true with kind of
methods of analysis paradigms and so on
there are things where we just sort of say oh that's just random stuff out there
and then we have some paradigm for thinking about it and we say no no no
that's really a blah blah blah we have a name for it and so on kind of thing
and i think that's um uh that's kind of and what we're doing as we come up
with different measuring devices as we come up with different methods of
analysis different paradigms we're gradually expanding the
domain ultimately in rural space that we have access to as observers
and we're gradually expanding the domain where we can pull in
kind of things happening out there in the world into our internal experience
and i think that that it is interesting that
i mean i don't really understand it's something one one should study
kind of this this funnel of of just how far are we getting in rural space how
far are we getting you know all these measuring devices there are 10 000
different kinds of units that we measure we
inventoryed all of them for for now for for example
um and uh you know what how far do we get with this
you know if we go another if we look at you an interesting question it's very
simple historical question is how have the number of such
units increased over time the specifics of units have probably
changed because they've become more standardized and it's not like
every city state has its own weights and measures type thing
um but if we look at the the kinds of things you know length
time to the minus three you know mass to the minus two or something what
what what forms of thing have we tried to measure
i'm sure there's a growth of that over time it'd be interesting to see what
that is and that's kind of the uh in a sense that's the sort of
that's the progression of our ability to observe things in
in the world it'd be an interesting thing to look at
all right well thanks very much for joining me
and um uh you can read the uh the main essay that i was going through here
um at writings.stevenmorton.com and um uh you can ask
more questions and have more discussion at our at my sort of
regularly scheduled um live streams that come up twice a week
Wednesdays and Fridays normally so anyway thanks for joining me
and uh until another time bye for now
