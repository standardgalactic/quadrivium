00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,040
Over 230 years, through world wars, the rise and fall of nations and industries, revolutions

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,200
and uprisings, Bering's Bank persevered.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,400
Founded in 1762, Bering's Bank was an English institution associated with class, longevity

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,560
and strength, so much so that even the Queen of England had an account with them.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,960
Then, in 1995, this grand banking legacy was destroyed, brought down by a single rogue

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,560
trader by the name of Nick Leeson.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:44,360
So, let's explore how a 28-year-old from Hertfordshire was able to single-handedly destroy an institution.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:55,360
You are watching Cold Fusion TV.

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,160
Nick Leeson was born in Wardford, Hertfordshire, to a middle-class home.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,960
He was a confident but unimpressive student.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,480
Despite his average educational performance, he was eventually able to secure a job with

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,200
Morgan Stanley.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,680
He worked in their futures and options department, giving support to the traders on the frontline.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,080
In 1989, two years after starting with Morgan Stanley, Nick Leeson approached his supervisor

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,720
and asked to be promoted.

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,760
Leeson wanted to be a trader and he felt that he deserved the promotion.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,720
Unfortunately, his manager didn't agree and the request was turned down.

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,920
But Leeson knew what he wanted and, subsequently, he quit Morgan Stanley.

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,040
On his quest to become a stock trader, he would come across Bering's Bank and send in his

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
application.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,480
Apparently, he'd never heard of the bank before submitting the application.

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,960
At that stage, I probably would be happy to say that I'd never heard of Bering's.

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,520
But it was a famous old bank.

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,720
So, there's no Bering's in Watford.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,680
Bering's was no ordinary bank.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,800
It catered to the most affluent class of people.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,920
In the banking industry, the Bering's name was respected.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,760
It was the safest of all banks and they could raise capital very easily.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,000
Though, behind the scenes, its operations were struggling to keep up with the modern

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
banking world.

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,120
Leeson described the securities trading department of Bering's as being in stark contrast to

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,880
modern banks like Morgan Stanley.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,320
Just a totally different environment.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,160
There was, you know, Morgan Stanley, everything was new.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,680
You know, all of the equipment was new.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,360
The furniture was new.

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,120
At Bering's, everything is, you know, just tacky, I suppose.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,200
I can't describe it any other way.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,520
From his position as one of the bank's bookkeepers, it didn't take him very long to find flaws

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,240
in how the bank operated.

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,320
Bering's bank was crumbling during a time when most other financial institutions were

43
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,840
thriving.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,560
Feeding on the good standing that comes with two centuries of global trading, it would

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,600
survive though, much like it always had.

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,600
But what Bering's wouldn't survive would be hiring Nick Leeson.

47
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,400
While many in the industry, including Leeson, possessed the intelligence to succeed, Leeson

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,680
also had a confidence and a way with people that he would wield like a secret weapon.

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,640
He was charming, friendly, and personable to his colleagues.

50
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,880
But not just for the sake of being polite.

51
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,320
He saw his co-workers, not as potential companions, but rather a means to an end.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,920
Despite working at banks for multiple years, he never considered his co-workers his friends.

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,720
He did not like them, he did not respect them, but he knew that sometimes he needed them

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,560
to get what he wanted.

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,320
It's very easy for me to get on with people, but I don't necessarily have to like you

56
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,240
or any of the people that I work with to get on with them.

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,200
So I come in, I do my job, I do it to the best of my ability, and then at the end of

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
the day, if you're going to ask me out for a drink, I'm not going to go out for a drink

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,600
with you because I don't like you.

60
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,280
Nick Leeson impressed his superiors at bearings with his keen eye for identifying and solving

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,400
issues within the bank.

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,680
Not long into his employment, he was sent overseas to chase down massive sums of money.

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,960
These were debts that were long overdue, but never followed up on.

64
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,680
Bearing's bank had a habit of making deals that would fall between the cracks, and it

65
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,400
was Nick Leeson's fresh eyes that would hunt down these deals and claim back what the bank

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,800
was owed.

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,880
Leeson managed to find close to £100 million, the equivalent of twice of that today when

68
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,680
factoring inflation.

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,840
He describes this kind of mismanagement as being fairly typical for bearings.

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,560
Things were looking good for Leeson.

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,360
He was impressing his employees, and while in Jakarta, he met a fellow bearing staff

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,480
member by the name of Lisa Sims.

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,280
For the first time in his career, he found a colleague that he genuinely liked, and

74
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,520
in 1992, the two of them married.

75
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,360
But same month, his years of hard work finally paid off when bearings offered him the position

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
of a trader.

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,160
He would be in charge of a newly founded futures division in Singapore.

78
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,600
This was the opportunity that Leeson had been waiting for, and quite possibly, the worst

79
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,480
decision that bearings had ever made.

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,280
Approved to trade in Singapore, and having convinced his wife Lisa to move, it was go-time.

81
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,960
Being primarily on the Nikkei, Japan's top 225 company stock index, Nik thoroughly enjoyed

82
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,360
the stress and pressure of futures trading, essentially betting on if the price will rise

83
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,860
or fall.

84
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,120
If the market went the way he predicted, he made money.

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,280
If not, he rapidly lost money.

86
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,280
He was confident in himself and beloved by his staff, but later that year, the market

87
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,120
began fluctuating violently, and Leeson's team started making mistakes.

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,560
These bad bets were adding up, and if they weren't rectified, bearings stood to lose

89
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,280
large sums of money.

90
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Out of the fear of losing the job that he worked so hard to obtain, and fuelled by his

91
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,860
own self-confidence, Nik decided to hide the losing bets from his employers back home.

92
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,160
In order to do this, he altered the software of a separate hidden account so that his bosses

93
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,680
in England couldn't keep track.

94
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,400
He named this account the 5 eighths account.

95
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,560
After Leeson kept his losing trades active, but hidden, he assumed that inevitably he'd

96
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,880
be able to cancel out the losses with future wins.

97
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,040
But there was only one problem with this, margin payments.

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,360
While the losing trades remained open, payments still had to be made in order to keep the

99
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,640
trades going.

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,760
He was going to need external funding.

101
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,600
He just needed enough money to keep the failed trades going, and when the market turned around,

102
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,520
he'd be home free.

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,480
Leeson would hide his mistakes, and then when the market went his way, he would fix his

104
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,680
mistakes in private.

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
Nik had to keep digging into a deeper pit of lies.

106
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,320
His bosses over in England could never find out what happened.

107
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,440
He asked his superiors for funds to cover stock futures that he'd bought for clients.

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,880
Only this time, the clients didn't exist.

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,040
Trusting that Leeson had the bank's best interests in mind, the branch over in England

110
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,400
happily sent him ever-increasing amounts of money, without ever thinking to double-check

111
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,120
where the money was actually going.

112
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,880
Surprisingly, for a time, the system worked.

113
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Leeson described living with the lies as easy after the first two days.

114
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,840
From the first time I do anything, I'm not expecting to survive anything more than two

115
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
days.

116
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,320
To me, it's obvious.

117
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,560
If they can't see it after two days, then who says they're going to see it after two

118
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
hundred days?

119
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Five hundred days?

120
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
A thousand days?

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,440
I don't get confident, but you're getting away with it.

122
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,480
As Nik Leeson continued to cover up his trading mistakes, Bering's itself was making massive

123
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,600
losses, and that was just the amount they knew about.

124
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,840
Something had to be done, so they recruited Peter Norris.

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,000
He was to oversee operations.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,320
From the moment he began looking at the bank's records, Norris was shocked at what he found.

127
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,080
The books were a mess.

128
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,040
How shocked were you by the lack of control in that when you got in there and began to

129
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,240
work there?

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:24,720
I was shocked because I didn't feel that it should have been allowed to reach that point.

131
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,960
He saw a bank on the brink of collapse with ever-increasing debt and a loose grip on its

132
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,360
standing as a powerful player in the financial world.

133
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,400
He brought in a team to clean up the mess.

134
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,720
But the dire situation that shocked Norris was merely a fraction of the problem.

135
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:46,240
He was yet to find the hidden account in Singapore that would eventually collapse the entire bank.

136
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,720
Meanwhile, Leeson's plan to gradually cover his losses and emerge victorious had not gone

137
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,920
to plan.

138
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,920
By the end of 1992, his losses had only grown, now amounting to £4 million.

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,840
Seeing no way out, there was only one thing to do.

140
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,400
Gamble even harder.

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,320
Going against the bank's rules, he bought hundreds of additional futures in hopes of

142
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,920
covering his losses.

143
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,920
He bought so many orders that if the market was to move in his favour, it would completely

144
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,640
wipe out his debt.

145
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,360
He believed he could make his money back without anyone ever finding out what he had done.

146
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,400
At this point, he was struggling to sleep at night.

147
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,840
But surprisingly, it worked.

148
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,920
By July of 1993, he had covered his losses.

149
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,260
Leeson described the past nine months as a living nightmare, but he had done it and come

150
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,060
out relatively unscathed.

151
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,260
Unfortunately for all involved, Leeson had not learned his lesson.

152
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,620
In fact, what he had learned was how to commit fraud and get away with it.

153
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,900
Rather than take away a valuable lesson in risk management, Leeson saw an opportunity

154
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,620
to get filthy rich.

155
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,580
Nick was convinced by his past successes that he would eventually be able to trade out of

156
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,860
any amount of losses and maintain his reputation as an industry legend.

157
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,980
In his mind, he was a genius that had beaten the system.

158
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,380
But in reality, what had happened was just dumb luck.

159
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,820
Meanwhile, back in England, Bering's was recouping losses and the work of Peter Norris

160
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,500
was paying off.

161
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,660
Things were going well and the bank was recovering.

162
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:26,300
But the work wasn't over, so Bering's brought in a new head of in-house trading, Rob Baker.

163
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,220
Baker was a smart man and he valued tight oversight unlike his predecessors.

164
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,220
He was cynical of profits that couldn't be easily accounted for.

165
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,260
Because of this, Nick Leeson's department quickly caught his eye.

166
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,980
You see, Bering's bank was paying Nick Leeson to fund requests for new clients and they

167
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,340
noticed that some of these clients, who actually in reality didn't exist, were not keeping

168
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,780
up with their fees.

169
00:10:50,780 --> 00:11:00,820
An internal audit was ordered and in July of 1993, the auditors flew to Singapore.

170
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,220
By the end of 1993, Leeson had found himself in the same trouble as last time, only this

171
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,300
time doubling up his strategy didn't work.

172
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,900
By the time Baker came face to face with Leeson, his secret account was now hiding losses

173
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,220
of 94 million pounds.

174
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,540
Nick would sometimes lose a million pounds in a single day.

175
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,940
Rob Baker saw through Leeson's confidence, recognizing a struggling and immature man

176
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,740
who didn't take too kindly to being overseen.

177
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,460
But what he could not have predicted was what was truly going on behind the scenes.

178
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,380
Leeson was now extremely worried.

179
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,020
He understood that if the auditors found just one document referring to the secret 5 eighths

180
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,540
account where his losses were hidden, his entire scheme would unravel.

181
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,860
But luck would be in his favor again, as the auditors surprisingly found nothing.

182
00:11:49,860 --> 00:12:06,780
Leeson would later state that it was general incompetence from the bearing staff that allowed

183
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,860
him to go on undiscovered.

184
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,540
But Rob Baker has a different theory.

185
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,220
Nick was supposedly making the bank a bunch of money, so they didn't bother to question

186
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,780
the fact that Nick was both the head of Singapore Trading Operations and in charge of the Singapore

187
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,980
accounting.

188
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,180
And despite the strange accounts not paying any fees, bearings thought, hey, if it's

189
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,540
making us money, don't fix it.

190
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:39,340
By September of 1994, the secret 5 eighths account was hiding losses of 160 million pounds.

191
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,260
Leeson's fraud entered new levels of complexity.

192
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,860
He decided to use the secret account to buy futures from himself at extremely discounted

193
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,740
prices, allowing him to fake massive profits.

194
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,540
Nick was now in a deep, vicious, unsustainable cycle.

195
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,100
It could only continue so long as he had access to the fund that bearings would send him for

196
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,900
fake clients.

197
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,340
His life became a runaway train.

198
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,540
In secret, he was losing millions daily, but in public, he was becoming the star trader

199
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,260
that he always wanted to be.

200
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,940
Neither could exist without the other.

201
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,380
At this time, Leeson became known as the king of the exchange.

202
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,380
He was making a name for himself and had convinced the world that he was a success.

203
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,220
In December of 1994, Leeson was flown to New York.

204
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,980
Here, bearings held a traders conference and Nick was the star.

205
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,820
After all, according to the records, he had made the bank 28 million pounds that year

206
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
alone.

207
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,820
He was the poster boy of bearings bank and celebrated for a success.

208
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,540
But some of the other traders weren't as excited.

209
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,460
They had done their own maths and something didn't add up.

210
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,020
But the bearings bank executives paid no attention to these doubts.

211
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,220
The bank was on the way up.

212
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,220
It even got to the stage when Nick was asking for hundreds of thousands of pounds per day

213
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,860
for margin payments and without question, it was given to him.

214
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,860
By the end of 1994, based solely on lies, confidently told and expertly hidden, bearings

215
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:19,900
bank had transferred 75% of their entire capital into the hands of one man, Nick Leeson, 330

216
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,740
million pounds.

217
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,940
The pressure had become too much for Leeson and he had finally reached breaking point.

218
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,740
How could he live a lie so massive?

219
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,780
On a Christmas trip to Ireland, he told his wife that he did not want to return back to

220
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
Singapore.

221
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,740
But Leeson didn't understand why he would turn down such a great opportunity for their

222
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
family.

223
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,940
Nick couldn't bring himself to tell her the truth.

224
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,980
So he returned to Singapore in the new year.

225
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
Why lie?

226
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,980
I'm his wife.

227
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,980
Why should he lie?

228
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,860
I mean, I suppose lots of wives think that when they find out their husbands have been

229
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,740
having an affair and they think, well, you know, they've been leading a double life.

230
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,740
And that's what it feels like.

231
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:06,580
Not that Nick had an affair, it feels like Nick was leading a double life.

232
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,500
There was no economic or political factors impacting the Japanese market.

233
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,700
So Nick Leeson bet on stability and for a while it was working.

234
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,780
For a couple of weeks he was making a profit as the market remained steady.

235
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:24,100
If this kept going, his losses could be erased and he would be victorious once again.

236
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,940
But on January 17th at 5.46am, a massive earthquake struck the Japanese city of Kobe.

237
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,820
It killed 6,000 and displaced 45,000.

238
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:40,100
The Japanese Nikkei Stock Index, in which Nick was trading, absolutely crumbled.

239
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,260
It was bad, you know.

240
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,580
But again, it's living to fight another day, really.

241
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:53,380
I mean, you know, without the choice of running away from it, you know, I had to, bearings

242
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,140
were still paying me money, don't forget, they were still paying me masses of money,

243
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
you know.

244
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,180
I mean, we'd ask for sometimes for $100 million, they'd pay it.

245
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,020
With the market running away from him, he was desperate.

246
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,780
He made one final bet, buying thousands more futures contracts in an attempt to prop up

247
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,420
the market.

248
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,020
He was hoping that this move would be substantial enough to fight against the crash.

249
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,660
It was another failed gamble.

250
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,940
In a single day he lost a further £50 million, but he continued down this path.

251
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,780
He asked the bank for more money which they would provide on the basis of falsified profits,

252
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,740
fictitious profits manufactured from the secret 5 eighths account.

253
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,780
While bearings continued to believe Lee Sin's deception, they were happy with his falsified

254
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,860
profits and trusted that he was doing well.

255
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,980
They believed that he was taking advantage of the chaotic market since the earthquake

256
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,420
and making huge sums of money for everyone involved.

257
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,980
At one stage, auditors found a £50 million loss that Nick forgot to hide.

258
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,420
Frantically, Nick forged a bank loan document with scissors and glue to cover it up.

259
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,300
Amazingly, the auditors believed the document, even though it had, from Nick and Lisa at

260
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,100
the top, the fax signature from their home machine.

261
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:14,620
Then, finally, after all the close calls, audits, unimaginable debt, and luck, both

262
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,100
good and bad, Lee Sin's time was up.

263
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,060
On the 17th of February, a single clerk in Singapore noticed some discrepancies in Lee

264
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,300
Sin's accounts and brought them to his attention.

265
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,980
After failing to deflect the clerk's enquiries for a week, he knew that this time he couldn't

266
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,140
make this one go away.

267
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,340
Feeling that the walls were finally closing in, Nick told the clerk that his wife was

268
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,340
unwell.

269
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,700
He had to go and visit her, and he'd be back in 45 minutes.

270
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,540
Of course, this was a lie.

271
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,380
Nick frantically rushed home to collect his wife, packed up his belongings, and they both

272
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,020
drove to the airport and boarded a flight to a luxury resort in Malaysia.

273
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,500
That week, with Nick gone and not being able to provide any more distractions, the bearings

274
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,900
officers from London were finally able to access one of Lee Sin's accounts.

275
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,740
It was a horrific disaster.

276
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,340
They knew straight away that bankruptcy was inevitable.

277
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:47,860
Bearings appealed to England's central bank for support.

278
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,860
They were desperate for a bailout before the markets opened again on Monday.

279
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,860
But it was impossible.

280
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,900
Lee Sin's losses had multiplied to 830 million pounds, the equivalent of US$2 billion today.

281
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,220
It was clear that the bank couldn't be saved.

282
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:09,380
After two long centuries of banking, bearings collapsed.

283
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,500
On the 20th of November 1995, Lee Sin was arrested in Germany and extradited to Singapore.

284
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,700
He was charged with two counts of deceiving the bank's auditors and of cheating the Singapore

285
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,180
exchange.

286
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:26,020
He received a six and a half year prison sentence, but he was released after four years for good

287
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,140
behaviour.

288
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,820
In all of this, Lee Sin maintains a dismissive and blameless attitude towards the events

289
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,100
that caused the crash.

290
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,820
In his mind, the fault lies with those who ran bearings and not him.

291
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,740
Why didn't those people who ran bearings come to you and say, what are you doing?

292
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Because they're stupid.

293
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,500
They don't understand the business and they should never have been in the position that

294
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,780
they were in, especially people like Tony Hawes.

295
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,580
He was supposed to be controlling the global treasury function.

296
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,740
He was supposed to understand derivatives.

297
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
He didn't.

298
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:06,860
And he would pay the money every single day and would accept pretty ridiculous explanations

299
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
from me.

300
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,860
It wouldn't happen at Morgan Stanley.

301
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,860
At bearings, they had a lot of idiots basically in every one of the controlling functions.

302
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:19,260
And you were creating a large amount of profits?

303
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,020
Fictitiously, yeah.

304
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,660
It's a complete amazement, but as you get to know the people at bearings, you can then

305
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,660
understand the amazement.

306
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,940
A lot of them are just bumbling fools.

307
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,420
Although his arrogance is distasteful, the law was inclined to agree with him.

308
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,500
The courts found bearings to be responsible for the deficit in internal auditing and risk

309
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
management.

310
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,420
Their carelessness allowed the fraud to spiral out of control.

311
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,420
But this shouldn't distract from the fact that hordes of people lost their jobs and

312
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,820
their money during the bearings' failure.

313
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,260
In the fallout from the collapse, Dutch bank ING bought bearings for a single pound.

314
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,620
They later sold off various assets.

315
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:04,340
Today, bearings exists only as a cautionary tale, a lesson to banks across the globe that

316
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,380
accountability and careful oversight comes before blind trust and the thrill of profit,

317
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:17,780
and a reminder to long-standing institutions that nothing is eternal.

318
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,380
Lyssen's life has been consistently strange since his imprisonment.

319
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,060
Being somewhat of a household name for older generations, he has dipped in and out of the

320
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:55,020
public eye, even competing in the 2018 season of Celebrity Big Brother.

321
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,540
So that my friends is the wild and twisting story of Nick Lyssen, a story of how one man

322
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:07,020
got himself into an ever deeper hole until he destroyed the oldest bank in England.

323
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:12,180

326
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,540
Let me know in the comments section below.
