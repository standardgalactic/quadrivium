Well I'm always bringing home the dogs that's found beside the road I feed them and I pet
them and they keep me on my toes well but now it's gone a bit too far I don't see why
it's me that has to take the strays in from the whole damn galaxy but I'm the stray dog
ran and I do what I can give them pop some love and end the home but I wish the ones
in space would go find another place and leave me at my doggies here alone
Well I was sitting in the back yard in a t-shirt drinking a beer it was a hot muggy evening
but the sky was crystal clear well I heard an engine pop in but there was no one on the
lane so I shrugged and looked to heaven rubbed my eyes and looked again there was a kind of
flying pick up with a glow crossed back and as I watched it hover there out flew this gunny
sack well that pick up truck got fuzzy then it flashed into the sky that gunny sack bounced off
the roof and it landed with a cry well I'm the stray dog man and I do what I can give them
pop some love and end the home but I wish the ones in space would go find another place
and leave me at my doggies here alone
Well now old Rover bound it over he sniffed around the sack then he took off running and he ain't
ever coming back well for Pido was the next to go he bit down on that thing he died before
he finished and he started turning green kind of saddened four legs sticking straight up
in the air well now that gunny sack hit rustle then it opened dark and white with the ugliest
damn critter that I ever saw inside well it crawled out stretched and creamed itself
then it ate poor Fido raw picked up the tractor and gulped it down and sat back with the young
well by now I was getting my pee see that was a brand new John Deere
but I'm the stray dog man and I do what I can give them pop some love and end the home
but I wish the ones in space would go find another place and leave me at my doggies here alone
well now I got a collar on it and I hold it to the shed it tried to eat the padlock
but I fed it nails instead well it cried all night out there alone
but I knew what to do I put a clock inside a mitten but it ain't dead summer too
guess I got kind of hungry when the alarm went off
it was kind of cute when you got to know him though I named him Ursa Major
it's cause he is a major pain in the earth
well I finally got him paper-trained and I soon was glad to find that everywhere that I would go
or slip tag behind well the other dogs accept him now he eats the ones that fight
the twelve of them are nasty hunting rabbits late at night
the rabbit thinks he's smart he hides inside a tree
well Ursa eats the tree
and I'm the stray dog man and I do what I can give them pop some love and end the home
but I wish the ones in space would go find another place and leave me at my doggies here alone
well now I thought that was the end of it but when a month went by
another flyin' pick up through a sack out on the fly
well it struggled and it rumbled in that gunny baggy burst
and the thing that was inside it ate Ursa Major first
well now it happens every month or so and I'm getting kind of vexed
as soon as I get fond of one it gets eaten by the next
so I'm building me a rocket next time I see a sack
I'm gonna toss it in the nose going and I'll throw that sucker back
cause I'm the stray dog man and I do what I can give them pop some love and end the home
but I wish the ones in space would go find another place and leave me at my doggies here alone
yes I wish the ones in space would go find another place
and leave me at my doggies here alone
