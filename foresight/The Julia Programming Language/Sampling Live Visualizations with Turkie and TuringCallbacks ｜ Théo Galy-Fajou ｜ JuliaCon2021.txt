Hello. Imagine. You just wrote your latest Turing model. You found out the perfect sampler.
But your model is a bit complex, and the estimated time is already quite big, a few hours. But
you have time, and you have big expectations. So you wait.
Well, it failed, and you might have reacted violently. That's why, in Turing, we decided to
offer you solutions. The first one is called Turkey, a mix of Turing and Macky. And the second one
is called Turing callbacks, based on TensorBoard. But let's go about Turkey first.
When you take two of the most popular and elaborate packages of Turing, you can only
get the best out of it. By mixing a bit of Turing and Macky, you obviously get Turkey.
So how does it work? All you've got to do is create a Turkey callback object with all the variables
and statistics you would like to see. It's going to create a Macky figure, like you're going to pass
as a callback to your sample function. It's a simple plug-and-play situation.
The figure is going to be updated with all the samples incoming. For example, here we can see
four three different variables, the histogram, the density estimation, the mean and the variance of
the estimators, and the auto correlation. This way, you can control everything is going well.
Turing callbacks works exactly the same way. It's passed as a callback to the sample function,
and all data is sent to the TensorBoard session that you can view for your brother.
Plus, like with Turkey, we can see both traces and statistics about the sampler
and the variables that we want. You can also benefit from the whole TensorBoard API by
saving and loading your data. And it tends to be a bit more robust when you have very long
sampling sessions, where it may be better to just check once in a while than to see it live,
second by second. Turkey and Turing callbacks are basically complementary packages.
Just check what is best for you. Thanks for watching and thanks for the contributors to all these packages.
