Let me get going. What I'm going to talk about, like I said, Catalyst.jl today, and this is
really a set of two kind of software libraries. Catalyst is a DSL for biological systems,
and it's built on top of Modeling Toolkit, and a lot of people have worked on these packages.
Chris and Torkle have done a lot of the Catalyst work with me. Nicholas has also done some,
and then Shashi and Yingbo, who aren't here today, have both done a lot of Modeling Toolkit work that
we leverage. So what is Catalyst.jl? So it's a Modeling Toolkit-based symbolic
representation for chemical reaction systems, which in the lingo here are stored as reaction
systems. So it allows us to build a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction system.
It also is a domain-specific language that sits on top of that that allows us to easily specify
chemical reaction networks and systems in a very clean notation. So it's kind of these two core
components, one that you can use programmatically, and one that you can kind of use to quickly map
out or type up reaction systems. And then it supports conversions to a large variety of other
modeling Toolkit symbolic models, like ODEs, SDEs, and jump processes, so that you can actually
simulate various reaction models from your reaction system. And it also includes an API
for querying and manipulating reaction networks. And so I think showing is always better than
telling, so I thought I would just show you some simple examples to illustrate things today.
So here, for example, is a classical what's called the repressilator model. Here's the DSL for
specifying the reaction network, where we type in all the different reactions and their corresponding
rate functions or rate constants. And you can use Nicholas's nice LaTecafi package to get a nice
display of what those reactions actually are once you build the model. But the point is that
this generates a nice modeling Toolkit based symbolic model of this chemical reaction system
for us. And this is just what those reactions actually are. So you can do things like look
at graphs of the network using GraphViz. So we use some well very nicely put together code developed
by Catlab that we've now integrated and that we use to do GraphViz base rendering. So here you
can see a little graph showing the different species of our chemical system in blue. And then
the little orange nodes correspond to reactions and the inputs and outputs show the stoichiometry
for a given species going in and out of the reaction. And this is one thing that we've
gotten together in more recently and hopefully in the future we can expand to more other types
of graph representations. So why should you use Catalyst? So I have a ton of reasons here which
I realized if I try to go through them all we'll eat up most of my time. So I just want to mention
a few of the reasons and I'll show you some more with examples as we go. So what is it gives you
a nice way to generate symbolic modeling toolkit models for mass action type ODE models but you
can also have custom rate law so you don't have to have mass action rate laws, non-linear systems
of equations to solve states, chemical Langevin SDE models, the less speed type jump process
models, i.e. master equation models. And recently this has started to be leveraged by people out in
the broader community. There's a really what looks like a really nice package that just became
available this week on doing moment closures that lets you take a Catalyst network as among other
input sources and from it generate a variety of modeling toolkit based symbolic ODE moment
closure models that you can then solve numerically using further tooling. Because it's built on top
of modeling toolkit we all we get all the great things that Chris and Yingbo and Shashi and others
have built like we can generate ODE right hand side functions that have certain optimizations
like being multi-threaded and other types of optimizations for the generated code by doing
analysis of the symbolic code. We can get automated Jacobians. One place where it's really helpful
is for jump systems so for jump process models many of the simulation algorithms require what are
called dependency graphs that show if a given reaction occurs what reaction should be updated.
All that kind of stuff can be generated for you in an automatic way by going through modeling
toolkit and then converting from our reaction system into jump systems. And of course at the
end of the day what you end up with are nice compiled ODE SD jump process models that you can
throw into all the other great Siam L tooling for sensitivity analysis parameter estimation
bifurcation analysis using Roman's package as he'll talk about in the next talk and so on so for
okay. So I just wanted to show you how simple this is. So we have that repressor repressor
later model that I started the talk with. So here's how you convert it from a reaction system
into a symbolic ODE model you just say convert and then we can use La Techify to see what the ODE's
we get are and this is the system that we get. And so you see here these kind of hill function
terms for the production of the mRNAs you've got your constant production terms you've got
degradation terms which it looks like they've got a little number one that we need to get rid of
but otherwise it gives us a nice way to kind of view what the ODE model is quite easily from our
reaction system. And then solving it is very little more work than that we just specify the
parameters of the model the initial condition the time window to solve over we construct an ODE problem
which is where the symbolic ODE model actually is going to get generated and converted into a
function that can be compiled and actually evaluate the ODE derivative right hand side
and then we can solve that using any of the differential equations.jl solver so here I'm
using the SIT5 Runge-Kutta method and we end up getting you know our nice classical oscillatory
repressor later system like we would expect. So that's an ODE model jump process models are also
very easy to do. So here you can see how to generate a jump process model and like I said
before the nice thing about going through this mechanism of building it in catalyst and then
converting it to a jump system and modeling toolkit is that everything we need for the jump
process solvers will be done for us so dependency graphs for more sophisticated solvers will be done
and also inside the underlying jump process solvers we have different ways of representing
jumps that increase in performance so if you have a jump that has an explicit time dependence so
explicit dependence on t in its rate function that's going to be a variable rate jump if you
have a jump that doesn't have such a dependence you'll be a constant rate jump if you have a jump
where your reactions are just mass action reactions it'll be a mass action reaction jump and by having
that classification we can get improved performance for each of those specific jump types and that
binning of which category a jump should go into is done completely automatically for you
when we generate the symbolic jump system or I should say when the symbolic jump system that I
create here is converted into the actual method that we solve and so here's how we actually
take the symbolic jump system we've converted our catalyst model to we define an initial condition
which needs to be integers since we're working with the number of proteins in the system we make a
discrete problem to say that that's we're going to solve a discrete system and now we make our jump
system our jump problem on top of it and that will be where actually the jump system will get
converted into compiled functions for evaluating the rate the various reaction intensities or
propensities that define the jump process and here I specify that I'm going to use the rejection
ssa method my dependency graph that it needs gets generated automatically for me and then I can solve
the whole thing and I get out a much noisier looking version of the repressilator model
so those are kind of the quick and dirty of how we can generate catalyst models and convert
to other types of mathematical models I just wanted to point out that this works very flexibly
now by being on top of modeling toolkit so for example you can define custom rate laws that are
essentially you know very general Julia functions and this is a this is a very simple example where
I've built a neural network to approximate 1 over x plus k where x is my species and k is my
McHouse-Mitton constant I you should never mimic what I've done here this was not intelligently
designed in any way this was like what can I just quickly put together as an illustration
but the point is that I can build a function neural network of x that evaluates an approximation
to this I can register it so modeling toolkit knows about it and then I can throw that in as
my rate law that I use for the reaction and so here this says that the rate law is going to be
s times this whole rate here vm times the neural network evaluated on s which would be s over k
plus s which is our McHouse-Mitton approximation and then from there it's just the same thing
create the od problem and solve it and sure enough we get something that looks like the
McHouse-Mitton reaction in fact to make sure that I didn't mess it up oh I guess I don't have that
code well you can take my word that I ran it with the McHouse-Mitton and it looked identical so
these qualitatively that worked just fine though I would not recommend mimicking how I did that that
was not a smartly designed neural network so one of the nice features we have is of course
typing in all those reactions by hand if you have a system with a lot of structure can get kind of
annoying so the DSL sits on top of the modeling toolkit reaction system model which means that
you can programmatically construct reaction systems when you have networks with a lot of
structure so here for example is what's called a reaction diffusion master equation model where
I have two species A and B that hop on a lattice so A at site one can hop to site two with rate one
over H squared A at site two can hop back to A at site one with rate one over H squared
and so on so forth the B's do the same and then A's and B's at the same location can react
with some rate lambda to annihilate so they're basically the molecules are all hopping around
and when they're in the same site there's some probability per time they can react
and this is super easy to generate with using the reaction system directly so I just give my
number of lattice sites I specify that my parameters are going to be time and the lattice
spacing I build in modeling toolkit two array variables for the A at each location in the B
at each location I make a vector to store all the reactions I want and then I just loop through
and create the reaction so I have reactions for an A going from site I to site I minus one
I to I plus one and you know A I and a B I annihilating and then I just create a reaction
system from my list of reactions and that's it now I've got all my reactions and I got my
modeling toolkit model the same code as I had before I can convert it to a jump process
representation I can make a discrete problem um and a jump problem from that which lets me
actually simulate it here I simulate it using the composition rejection direct method which
is good for spatial systems and you end up getting it something like this so here I start with 10,000
A's at one end 10,000 B's at the other end I've cut off the top just so to keep the axes fixed
you let it go over time you see the molecules diffuse inward and of course this bottom graph
is showing the total number of molecules remaining in the system so it shows you how many have
annihilated to get you know to go away and you see as time goes on they diffuse inward and they
react to go away this is not real time because actually it was much slower to make the movie
in plots.jl I found than it was to actually run the simulation so I had to pre-record that
okay so we've how far have we actually pushed this in practice
so we've built I could you can build decently sized spatial systems like the one I just showed
where you have a lot of spatial hopping reactions but uh but of course another question is how big
of a purely reaction system where all the reactions are physical can you do and so the largest that
we've looked at so far is a is a model for B cell signaling that has about 1100 chemical species and
almost 25,000 different reactions it comes from this paper by Barua and all and it's a model for
the early stages of B cell signaling we have a package reaction network importers that can take
bio net gen models and import them into catalyst and so this model is available as a bio net gen
model so we could import it in in that way and then at that point you can convert it from the
catalyst model to your symbolic ODE or jump models and solve them using differential equations.jl
and just to show you what ends up happening for this example so here's how it actually all works
it's very compact we load in the reaction network using bio net gen so we get initial conditions
parameters and then in part of loading it in we generate the catalyst symbolic model
and then just like before I convert to a system of ODE's I create an ODE problem which takes that
symbolic model of the of the whole system and generates essentially the compiled functions
for the ODE solvers and then I can solve it and we get quite good performance I think
the performance we get is as good or better than what we were getting in sundials though I haven't
benchmarked that super recently but we were we were matching CV ODE in fact at one point beating
it a little bit and you can see here this is just one particular species the activated syk protein
in the system and what's nice about this example is it's very it's a quite stiff system that also
has fairly large populations so it's good it's kind of a good benchmark for both the ODE solvers
and for the jump process solvers okay so the last thing I just wanted to mention in my last minute
is a little bit about Diffie Q jump so SyML has you know fantastic and amazing diversity of ODE
solvers but one thing that maybe is less well known is the jump process solvers which is something
that I've worked on and one nice thing like I said about catalysts is it generates everything you need
to use any of the jump process solvers so in particular we have a library of about eight
solvers and these include some very recent methods so there's the classical Gillespie direct method
there's methods like Gibson and Bruck's next reaction method that's very popular though people
who've benchmarked it know it actually is often not very fast so in many cases it's not a good
choice and we have more sophisticated methods like the composition rejection method which works very
good for spatial systems the recent rejection ssa which for that B cell system I showed you is
something like oh I forget 150 times or more faster than trying to use it it takes like three
seconds to solve it with the rsa method versus 10 000 seconds to solve it with Gillespie's direct
method so it's a huge huge speed up to use these kinds of methods for it and then more recently
we got the rejection ssa with composition rejection which is very good for spatial systems we found
and so these are the interesting thing is which method one should use is highly dependent on the
system one studying direct Gillespie's direct method works great for very small systems these
other ones are really good for larger systems with sparse reaction networks but the point is
this catalyst gets you set up to use any of them with very little work on your part so okay so I
can see I'm basically out of time so let me just mention there's a lot of things we're thinking
about working on for the future in particular compositional models optimizations for large
networks and network analysis tooling spatial models is something that hopefully this summer
we'll get a nice kick on uh and so on and so I'll just end there and thank everyone who's
worked on contributing to catalyst and modeling toolkit and mentioned my support and thank you all
for coming
