Okay, so starting point for today is actually this repository, it was already in the invitation.
So the first thing everyone has to do is to go to this repository and you see it's just
a little summary prepared for me for you and there are a couple of other introductions
which we already went through and today actually these two zero fourth things have been added
which are giving two little introductions to the differential equations package and
yeah we are going to start with the zero one introduction of course and let's hope we
have time for also the stochastics part, it's actually not so much.
So the thing you have to do is to click on this launch binder button here at the top.
It's not always as good recognizable as a button but indeed it's kind of a link which
you can click and then you get to this nice binder loading window, you see the preview
and within yeah usually under a minute.
Okay, so what we're going to look at today is the differential equations package and
this is one of the oldest package in the Julia ecosystem, so at least from my experience.
I've been more active in the Julia field since three years I would say and back then it was
already the most famous package at all from all and yeah it just increased a number of size
and yeah and depth so it's by now the largest package about differential equations and really
gives you access to state-of-the-art solvers to the latest development and also a lot of standard
baseline solvers so that you can do whatever you want in this field so in the sense and they
describe it themselves actually it's like a full stop solution so if you look for differential
equations you can go here and you will find everything you need so that's a little bit
of a promise I myself haven't used it in as much depth to give you kind of the full
guarantee this is really the case but from my experience with Julia just using Julia
as the language gives you actually quite a guarantee that this thing is hackable in case
something is not supported it is relatively easy and straightforward to extend it to
whatever you need in your own so that's really a nice thing and yeah and you see here so this
is kind of the introductory field there are a lot of things which are already supported
in the differential equations package so we have gone to standard ordinary differential
equations we have partitioned we have stochastic we have random we have differential algebraic
equations we have neural differential equations and yeah also combinations of these and there's
even support for discrete differential equations with this so here's the next discrete and continuous
equations so this thing is really super powerful also in terms of optimization but more focused
on on the continuous systems okay so so yeah now I just clicked again on it and it started
within five seconds okay so I hope everyone from a few has this Jupiter notebook and make
it larger so there are other introductions which we went through in the user group the
Julia user group Munich but today it's the zero for the differential equations introduction
which we're going to look at first so you just need to control click on it or just click on it
and so I make control click to have the other windows still open and then you should have
access to just a Jupiter notebook so who's not familiar with the Jupiter notebook the most
important thing is that you have a run button here with which you can actually execute the
single cells and you have a plus button here so with which you can create a new cell so a cell
is kind of yeah like a text editor and you have many text editors here and if you have such a Julia
or the programming cell you can actually use it and it's really just normal Julia and I'm still
connecting to the kernel right now so hence I can't and don't see any output now I'm connected so it
should execute in a second and you have just standard Julia surrounding so you can also
import packages and yarns and another way of executing things is which I use most kind of
shift enter or control enter but you can always kind of just yeah just add a new cell and run it
so that's the totally go your way to do it and it works so you've kind of a ready setup yeah so
I've you have a Jupiter notebook here running on the server with a lot of packages pre-installed
and actually also pre-compiled and so that things should be a bit faster so that's really nice
and powered by binder so that's thanks to that okay so the differential equations package has a lot
to do and the first thing which the documentation really recommends is to go through the tutorial
about ordinary differential equations so that's the first thing everyone should have seen and hence
I just rephrase this tutorial into a Jupiter notebook for you so that you can really execute it
right now just for you to have the the background so we are kind of having a version of this first
tutorial the ordinary differential equations tutorial so this is now kind of recompiled
into a Jupiter notebook version which we have here so you can a little bit more conveniently go
through it so let's jump right into it but to give you already feeling and yeah maybe go
all to the first Julia cell here and you can click also on this little run button to run it
because the first time the Julia package loads still some things take a little bit longer because
Julia is a just-in-time compiled language we have pre-compilation which improves startup times
but still there's a couple of things which just need to be compiled on the first run
and then they are blazingly fast but the first time takes a bit longer
so what do we have here we have kind of just an introduction to a general differential equation
so we have our target variable u where we don't know the real formula the the equation but we can
model the derivative of this function so that's kind of the usual approach the the real thing is
a bit too complex but we know how things change over time so this is kind of really general general
approach and you can use it to model anything like this yeah super super successful in physics
and everywhere but this is the the general approach so what do we have here in addition
what do we get we define kind of our function how things change over time and we get as input
parameters the actual values themselves so how is the world at the time where we currently are
and in addition we have kind of also access to some parameters this is just for convenience
so that we can make things a little bit more general and then change just some some parameters
and then look at different versions of things the last thing which we also get is the extra time
where we are in so because we model the difference over time how things change it's it can be quite
important like what's the current time and for to begin with we have just a very simple example
that things change and yeah what's this like an exponential manner yeah so if we have the change
over time is linear so alpha is just a constant linear to our current value what we currently have
so if we solve this we know that this is actually exponential function and yeah because we we add
what we already have this gets exponential i think it gives kind of an intuition and how
do we do this in julia it's now kind of an interesting part so we define our function really
plainly as a julia function so first is your import package using differential equations
if you're new to julia you may be confused because there are two versions to import a package
there's import and the using and the using is for practical usage like an import but it in
addition brings a couple of variables into your current namespace so that you can just start and
use the methods defined here and you see that we do this right now so we have an ordinary
different different equation problem and we have a method solve which comes from the package
and yeah so what we first do and this is really nice need julia syntax to define functions
um we just define a function called f which gets u p and t as parameters and we use a simple
equal sign to assign this to an expression which now just has a constant one dot one zero as this
alpha value and multiplies it by the current value of the system so you see that this assumes that
the system now is just a single value which you can multiply directly we have a u zero which is
like our initial world which we start with we started one half now for this little example
and we want to simulate our system for time span between zero and one so this we can now put into
an differential equation problem by first um providing the function the starting value then
and then the time span so this you just have to remember but it's relatively straightforward
so you pass them by position yeah first it's first and second and third but yeah it's the
usual way and defining them or giving them names first is one of the very straightforward ways to
make it very clean also in the code side that you see what's going on and yeah and finally we call
the solve function which is provided by the package and we solve our problem with a specific
solver so this is kind of an art in itself to choose the right solver and here we just take
the example from from the code so the Z5 is one of the recommended options but you can check out
the documentation there yeah there's a little art to it but you have also just a standard recommendation
we have a relative tolerance which you can set here absolute tolerance and this is just
to give you an idea that there are really a lot of more parameters which you can adapt
so this solve is like the general entry point where you can specify a lot of things same
for the problem itself so you can specify further things for the problem so you see that if we kind
of if we computed this we get a solution which here prints relatively nicely so we we see that
things have been successful we have a time vector for which we computed our system
and we have our solution u which is then our system for this time and we get a nice little
visualization of this using the general plots package so plots is the the user package for
plotting there's there's some other packages out there which are getting also more momentum
so the makey project is really awesome but yeah the plots is still for for newcomers is
the go-to and it's also used everywhere you see it's very relatively simple so what we do here is
just we activate again the plots package and this thing i should have made a comment here
it's just to get a nice interactive plotting system in our Jupiter notebook so this activates
plotly backend so you can visualize plots different ways you just can render them as PNGs
as images or you can render them as nice interactive html javascript combinations
and this is what we do with the help of plotting then we can just use the general plot command
with our solution here as as the first argument and then again with thousands of parameters
you can tweak whatever you want so here we tweak most obvious stuff the access names and title
not some label and nice thing you can adapt you can add to an existing plot and the only difference
is that you provide an exclamation mark in the end so this is the Julia sign for changing stuff
so we are going to change the current plot and add a new thing to it what we add is here the time
itself and over the time we plot a function and as you recognize this is our function which is
the optimal solution so if we solve our our system this is the true solution and we just plot it here
as well for visualization purposes so for a couple of you probably this already compiled
and this is one of the biggest drawbacks of Julia which is currently also approached so people are
working on this but because of this focus on being both high level interactive and super
performant with focus on throughput we we have this compilation step in the beginning so in
python you would see the first plot a little bit faster because it focuses on just executing the
code on the fly and interpreting it in the sense and Julia there are additional steps happening
to make the code fast and these additional steps are just slowing things down on the first time
which is a little bit unfortunate in in this setting but from the practical perspective
it was never a real issue for me because as soon as you have this thing running it's really
blazingly fast so first enjoy the nice interactive plotly landscape yeah so we can zoom in we can
zoom out we see a focus and we see also that we found the right solution and just to give you
the idea so if you execute it again it's now much faster so it doesn't take so long again
and should give you a plot yeah and reasonable time so you see it's already there so it's really
only the first time you plot things which takes the most time okay so we have a couple of questions
Roland asked how how the time is chosen so this yeah depends on your modeling so time
is of course like continuously yeah going on so you can kind of put everything into zero and one
but if you have a precise timing which let's say you want to model the last two years of two
populations in an ecosystem how they evolved of course it would be a natural thing to use this
time frame and then map it there and still you probably would map it to real numbers yeah to
to have a better feeling to make it yeah a bit more appropriate for the system but nevertheless
you give an interpretation then zero would be kind of start 2016 and one would be end 2018
that's really more based on your concrete use case marco asked question what's meant with
interpolation special edge fourth order free interpolation um yeah we have this as an output here
so yeah we see this and in a second at least this is my understanding of it so we can access
the solution in two ways the one is just by accessing the the single elements of this list
yeah of these arrays so that's quite natural and julia we can index into things by using the brackets
the square brackets and the first entry um is actually the one so you may have recognized this
already but yeah we we actually start with one and then count further and we can also use just
the the call syntax so we see we have our solution here and now we use normal parenthesis
and this will use the interpolation and here the interpolation can change depending on the
the software you use and a couple of parameters to specify configuration and giving our configuration
we get an interpolation which is actually not just linear adding two things and taking the
middle of it but we have a fourth order interpolation which is just more concrete and we get it so I
interpret we get it for free like it was not in addition computed but just the process itself
had to compute it anyway so we can safely use it and don't fear that anything was way
more way slower because we now have this awesome interpolation so this works nicely and you can
also check it like here they use an index there until you use the precise time so if we go something
near zero um yeah so we the approach what do we approach yeah 0.5 yeah it's the value
time zero match to 0.5 so it should be more more nearer 0.5 let's get this there and and it is
okay so what do we have so just to to repeat um what Christoph already answered in the chat
the free stands for that it's not yeah it's it's all done with just dot products
so actually linear combination of the basis functions are enough to to get the the fourth
order interpolation
