0	2940	Hello everyone. Thanks for turning out.
2940	6120	Those of you who are not in physics coming here in the rain,
6120	9360	is my pleasure to introduce Professor David Deutsch,
9360	11040	who is going to speak to us today.
11340	13700	Many of you will know David's name.
13700	17480	It's not controversial to say that he is one of the key individuals
17480	21100	who really kicked off the field that has become
21100	24580	the field of quantum information and quantum information technology,
24580	29740	which as you know Oxford now has a very large leading role in the UK and in the world.

80300	84280	.. ddiwrnod o'r prolref iait yn unig cyfnod,
84280	86280	yng Nghymru, David, o Chiarra.
86280	88280	So, David, ond, ond...
88280	90280	Thank you.
94280	101280	Right. Well, the ideas I'm going to talk about today are part of Constructor Theory,
101280	104280	which I've been working on with Chiarra Marleto,
104280	113280	and among other things, Constructor Theory uses a new mode of explanation,
113280	121280	of physical reality, through which we hope to eliminate a lot more than just probability,
121280	128280	a whole load of explanatory dead weight and blind alleys from physics
128280	133280	and from other sciences and even beyond science.
133280	135280	What's a mode of explanation?
135280	145280	Well, at present, the prevailing mode, which is mistakenly thought to be the most fundamental,
145280	147280	is like this.
147280	153280	There are particles and there are fields in spacetime,
153280	157280	and they obey laws of motion and initial conditions,
157280	165280	and once you know those, you can predict the whole of the rest of their behaviour.
165280	171280	But there are other modes of explanation in common use, in physics and elsewhere,
171280	176280	and here are some of them.
176280	181280	No? Yes. Good.
181280	186280	Just for illustration, I'm mainly going to talk about the probabilistic mode
186280	189280	that I've put in red there,
189280	200280	but as I said, Constructor Theory seeks to unify and to underlie all those modes and others
200280	205280	with a single mode of explanation, the Constructor Theoretic mode,
205280	216280	which is explanation via the dichotomy between transformations that it's possible to bring about accurately
216280	220280	and ones that it's not possible to bring about accurately,
220280	224280	and those are possible and impossible tasks.
224280	234280	Now, the basic principle of Constructor Theory is that just that all the laws of physics
234280	239280	are expressible in that way.
239280	247280	Since every task is supposed to be either definitively possible or impossible to perform,
247280	256280	there can't be such a thing as a task being possible with a given probability, not 0 or 1,
256280	260280	and at the fundamental level, such things might arise as approximations,
260280	263280	but that's not a description of reality.
263280	268280	Therefore, there's no place for probability, according to Constructor Theory,
268280	277280	there's no place for probability or random processes at the foundations of physics.
277280	284280	However, I'm not going to make the case against probability from Constructor Theory today.
284280	286280	It's more like the other way around.
286280	292280	This is a motivation for Constructor Theory because independently of Constructor Theory,
292280	297280	the world just is not probabilistic, it's an illusion,
297280	305280	and the probabilistic mode of explanation has about the same status as the Flat Earth Theory.
305280	314280	Namely, you might find it useful to use the predictions of the Flat Earth Theory
314280	316280	when you're planning out your garden,
316280	320280	but when you're thinking about what the world is like,
320280	325280	and even more when you're thinking about what the laws of nature are,
325280	337280	it would be hopeless the theory of the Flat Earth would just be an impediment to understanding what's out there.
337280	343280	So, same is true of probability, and so let me explain.
343280	352280	Well, probability and the associated concepts such as a stochastic process
352280	358280	that produces a random sequence of outcomes,
358280	366280	these weren't originally invented for any purpose in physics or any fundamental purpose.
366280	374280	But basic mathematical theory of probability, namely certain numbers attached to certain elements of a set
374280	380280	which then obey axioms like they all add up to one and stuff,
380280	390280	was invented in the 16th century by people who only wanted to win at games of chance.
390280	399280	This is one of them, Cardano, and that started off game theory,
399280	410280	and game theorists use the idea of a random sequence as a mathematical model of physical acts
410280	417280	that are integral to games of chance, such as shuffling a pack of cards or throwing dice,
417280	425280	and probability, via the central concept of equally likely,
425280	432280	was a mathematical model for the intuitive idea of fair shuffling of cards,
432280	438280	a fair dice and a fair throw of the dice.
438280	446280	So, when I say that, which is also essential to games of chance,
446280	454280	when I say that this was merely a mathematical model, perhaps I should say more clearly what I mean,
454280	461280	I mean that they didn't assume that anything in the physical world,
461280	468280	shuffling cards and so on, was literally what we would today call a stochastic process,
468280	472280	that it literally had properties such as probability.
472280	479280	That's because, first of all, the properties that they actually needed from shuffling cards
479280	484280	were far weaker than full literal randomness.
484280	493280	They were basically that the outcomes of shuffling should be fair and equitable among the players
493280	497280	and unpredictable to them.
497280	506280	So, that meant that the outcomes were not related in any simple way to any sequence or algorithm
506280	512280	that they could call to mind or execute during playing the game.
512280	519280	So, most pseudo random sequences would have done just as well if they'd had computers then.
519280	525280	And secondly, more importantly, I don't think it would even have occurred to them
525280	531280	to connect their probability in their model with some real physical quantity
531280	536280	because classical physics, which was in its infancy at the time of Cardano,
536280	541280	but bit later when it was perfected, was deterministic
541280	547280	and therefore inconsistent with stochastic processes happening in nature.
548280	555280	So, why did those game theorists blithly use mathematical axioms,
555280	561280	a probability theory that were both far too strong and already ruled out
561280	564280	by what was known about fundamental physics?
564280	568280	Well, simple. By being too strong, that's harmless,
568280	576280	that meant that they certainly satisfied the conditions that were necessary for analysing games.
576280	582280	And the real properties that they really wanted, such as fairness and so on,
582280	585280	couldn't be expressed precisely mathematically.
585280	590280	By the way, they can be expressed precisely in constructive theory,
590280	593280	but that's another story.
593280	599280	Consequently, it didn't matter also that their model relied on impossible physics
599280	607280	because the conclusions about game playing, if there had been that impossible physics,
607280	614280	led to the same conclusions about strategy and tactics as for the real physics.
614280	616280	So, it didn't matter for them.
616280	631280	There's another reason why they might have been blasé about the connection between their theory and physics.
631280	637280	Certainly this was a move made later in game theory and in probability theory up to the present day.
637280	645280	They might have regarded the probabilities not as attributes of the dice and the cards or the dealer,
645280	651280	but as attributes of the player receiving the cards.
651280	657280	That's the subjective interpretation of probability, and I'll come back to it in a moment,
657280	667280	but note already that whatever role the subjective state of mind of the player may play in this story,
668280	676280	fairness must depend on physical properties of the cards and dice and how they're treated during the game,
676280	686280	and therefore game theory must, in principle, be rooted in some sort of model of those objects and processes.
686280	694280	Anyway, from that theory, game theorists derived maxims for playing games of chance,
694280	699280	such as in poker, never draw to an inside straight,
699280	712280	and the important thing is that this was a narrow, parochial application of a mathematical trick, the theory of probability.
712280	724280	Indeed, the reason that game theory was possible at all was that its conclusions don't depend on the detailed physics of any game playing processes.
724280	729280	It didn't matter what the orbits of the planets are, it didn't matter what matter is made of,
729280	733280	or let alone anything deeper about the laws of physics.
734280	741280	The theory was directed specifically at modeling a particular human social behavior,
741280	747280	which even other animals don't do, let alone the physical world at large.
747280	754280	So it should be very surprising that this little mathematical trick, the theory of probability,
754280	762280	has found further applications in a very diverse fields in science and beyond,
762280	767280	and even that it seems to be fundamental to some of those fields.
767280	774280	So here are some of them, roughly in the historical order of their invention.
774280	781280	So we'd be surprised if, say, the seven of diamonds appeared in a law of physics.
782280	788280	But probability, which has the same provenance as the seven of diamonds,
788280	794280	seems to be central to physics in particular, and it seems to work.
794280	803280	So why would anyone want to expunge it from physics and from every other fundamental theory?
803280	809280	Well, of course, we don't need a reason. Physics likes to do without things.
812280	820280	As we discover more and more about the world, we sometimes find out that things that we thought existed don't exist,
820280	830280	such as celestial spheres and the force of gravity and trajectories of particles and so on.
830280	837280	They were all thought to exist, and then discovering that they don't exist was a great advance in understanding.
837280	845280	But before we can decide that something doesn't exist, we must explain what the world without that thing is like,
845280	852280	and also, preferably, why thinking in terms of that thing seemed to work
852280	858280	and why it was a useful fiction and why it may still be a useful fiction.
858280	863280	So compare these two statements.
866280	874280	The first statement specifies a factual, observable property of the world.
874280	882280	It specifies what will happen when poker is played and specified hands arise.
882280	886280	But the second one is not about physical facts.
886280	892280	It is consistent with any sequence of cards arising in a poker game.
892280	903280	In fact, it's consistent with any physical events, such as someone repeatedly drawing to an inside straight and repeatedly winning.
905280	909280	Not inconsistent. Yes, it's true that it was risky.
909280	919280	The second statement is true, all right, but it doesn't apparently refer to any physical events that actually happened in that case.
921280	930280	One sometimes hears a sort of desperate denial of this along the following lines.
930280	935280	The statement, it was too risky, is about the physical world.
936280	941280	It refers to all the other players who drew to an inside straight and lost,
941280	946280	and it refers to the fact that there are more of them. They outnumber the winners.
946280	949280	Well, first of all, it doesn't.
949280	954280	There have only been finitely many poker games in the world.
956280	959280	Ignore for the moment the fact that there are parallel universes,
959280	964280	and in those particular player, both wins and loses in different universes,
964280	971280	and quantum theory does in fact solve some of these problems, but not by counting the number of players.
971280	976280	So, for the moment, in a given universe or in classical physics,
976280	986280	the proportion of players who drew to an inside straight and lost doesn't exactly equal the probability of losing.
987280	992280	Just as repeated tosses of a fair coin, however fair it is,
992280	997280	don't result in equal numbers of heads and tails in general.
997280	1005280	And anyway, since when do gamblers care about whether other gamblers lose or win?
1007280	1010280	If probability refers to other players losing money,
1010280	1018280	it doesn't refer to any physical fact about the game as it actually was in the case that I cited.
1019280	1024280	And the same holds for all probability statements.
1024280	1029280	So, that's meant to be, in the second column, that's meant to be all probability statements.
1029280	1031280	That's the dot, dot, dot.
1032280	1047280	The blatant fact that is generally overlooked is that no statement from the second column can ever imply any statement from the first column.
1047280	1054280	In other words, assertions about probabilities do not refer to the physical world.
1054280	1058280	They don't assert anything about the physical world.
1058280	1065280	Frequencies, like the fraction of winners over losers historically, are things that happen in real life,
1065280	1069280	and therefore they don't, in general, equal probabilities.
1070280	1075280	And it's no good saying that they equal them approximately, because they don't.
1075280	1081280	They only probably equal them approximately, and that's a statement from the second column.
1082280	1087280	Similarly, you can't say that probability statements are about what will happen in the long run.
1087280	1094280	No, they aren't. All you can deduce from them are statements about what will probably happen in the long run.
1097280	1106280	But frequencies in an infinite sequence of measurements, of experiments, do equal the probabilities exactly,
1107280	1117280	and this inspires yet another desperate denial to the fact that the finite sequences are approximations to infinite ones.
1117280	1129280	But nothing about a finite subsequence of an infinite sequence can possibly follow from a statement about relative frequencies in the infinite sequence,
1129280	1138280	unless the subsequence is a typical one, and a statement that is a typical one belongs firmly in the second column.
1140280	1144280	Or you may take that subjective route that I mentioned.
1144280	1148280	You could imagine that probability statements are not assertions about the world at all.
1148280	1156280	They are assertions about our minds, probability being a measure of ignorance, or of a degree of rational belief.
1156280	1172280	Those are two different subjective theories called credence, but that's no good for present purposes because then you still need something to connect statements about our minds to statements about physical reality.
1172280	1192280	So, to this end, the philosopher David Lewis proposed his principle principle, which just asserts as an axiom that rational agents have the same credences as the physical probabilities.
1193280	1203280	But note that that gives no explanation about why those physical, purportedly physical numbers should inform decisions in that way.
1203280	1213280	You may as well propose an axiom that rational people avoid black cats or ladders. That's not physics.
1214280	1229280	So, the upshot is that Cardano and the game theorists never did succeed, after all, in their purpose of finding ways of winning at games of chance, or of minimizing their losses.
1229280	1234280	They only found ways of probably winning.
1234280	1257280	And later, people added these purported philosophical principles that say a rational person would do this or that, but actually a rational gambler knows that having probably won, no matter how often one does it, won't pay the rent.
1258280	1264280	Physically, physically, it is most unlike actual winning.
1264280	1284280	So, in case there still appear to be any clothes on this emperor, because of the mass of cultural interpretation that's been loaded onto it, just replace all the probabilistic terms in the second column by magical terms.
1285280	1301280	Why? What physical reason is there to allow statements in the second column to inform decisions by fiat and not statements in the third, which we could equally well connect to reality by some fiat?
1302280	1316280	That's the magical column. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
1317280	1340280	So, what I have called these desperate denials of the firewall between the first column and the other two are more commonly known as interpretations of the probability calculus, subjective interpretation, frequency interpretation, ensemble interpretations, and all in many variants,
1340280	1356280	regarded as attempts to connect the second column with the first, they are all, like the examples I've given, either circular or meaningless, or conflict with the probability calculus, or just don't do what they say they do.
1357280	1368280	This discussion that I've just given about the defects in the theory of probability draws on the work of David Papineau, who's a philosopher of probability.
1369280	1392280	He has called this situation at the heart of his field a scandal. Probability concepts and language and the whole theory simply form a closed system of statements and ideas that just refer to each other and can never yield a statement about the physical world.
1393280	1409280	Now, if we go back to the applications of probability, we can see that there is a common feature running through all of them. They are all in a certain sense and slightly different senses.
1409280	1422280	They're all normative. That is to say, they are about, at root, how one should act if one were to believe that certain potential events have particular probabilities.
1422280	1432280	Now, how one should act is rather a strange thing for a scientific theory to talk about. You know, you can't get an ought from an is.
1433280	1444280	In fact, the firewall between factual statements and moral statements exists for a very similar reason to the one separating factual statements from probability ones.
1445280	1463280	So, another way of papering over the divide or ignoring it is by different kind of fiat. One simply puts a normative statement about probabilities into the physical theory.
1464280	1472280	That's called a stochastic physical theory. There are many ways of expressing that fiat. Here's one.
1473280	1495280	So, it contains a lot of hidden stuff. It pretends only to contain that first row, but actually there are some purportedly factual statements about numbers that purportedly have something to do with physics.
1496280	1503280	And then there has to be a principle to give them some normative psychological meaning, the second row.
1503280	1512280	And then the third row, actually, you need another axiom from decision theory to say how one should actually behave rather than how one should think.
1512280	1538280	And this is weird, but luckily it so happens that the only stochastic theory that has ever been proposed in the history of science as a fundamental description of the world is quantum theory in its mid-20th century state vector collapse form.
1539280	1560280	And in that form, its probabilistic part is called the Born Rule, which says that if and only if an observable is measured, then the probabilities of the various outcomes are the moduli squared of those coefficients and the bottom line there.
1561280	1573280	By the way, does anyone here actually believe that the state vector collapse occurs in physical reality? Show of hands? Okay, no, good.
1574280	1589280	Oh, so one person, so you have my sympathy, and I hope you'll see in what follows that help is at hand, closer than you think.
1590280	1611280	So because, well, help is at hand because ordinary unitary non-collapse quantum theory provides in large part the way out of that whole probability scandal.
1612280	1630280	It's called the decision theoretic approach, sometimes called the decision theoretic approach to the Born Rule or to probability, but those are both misnomers because neither the Born Rule nor probability nor collapse, of course, ever appear in the decision theoretic argument.
1630280	1659280	In its simplest form, it goes like this. We imagine an array of gaming machines, one-armed bandits in a casino, so there's a whole array of them, and you play by inserting one casino token, and then when you pull the handle, the machine prepares a quantum system inside itself.
1660280	1674280	In a state psi, and then measures an observable x of that system, it then displays the result, as shown in red on the middle panel, and that will therefore always be an eigenvalue of x.
1674280	1688280	And then the machine delivers a payoff of that number of casino tokens, which need not be a whole number, we're allowing fractional tokens if x has non-integer eigenvalues.
1689280	1698280	Different machines in this casino are identical except for the state psi, which is constant for each machine, but different for different machines.
1699280	1711280	But the psi is not a secret, it's written on the front of the machine, just like this, conveniently expressed as a superposition of eigenstates of the observable x.
1712280	1731280	Now, four machines whose psi is a single eigenvalue of x, with eigenvalue little x, then playing on that machine is not a game of chance, it's just a matter of putting in one token and receiving back little x tokens.
1731280	1742280	Let's call that a classical machine, because it could be implemented without quantum systems, without quantum technology.
1742280	1760280	So, other things being equal, a rational player would be willing to play on any classical machine that has little x greater than one, and unwilling to play when it has little x less than one.
1761280	1772280	What about cases when psi is not an eigenstate of x? What then is the dividing line between being worth playing and not being worth playing?
1772280	1797280	Well, let's call the dividing line for a machine operating with state psi, let's call that dividing line v of psi, and this is perhaps a little bit of a wordy definition, but it's just the maximum amount of money that the player would be willing to pay for the privilege of playing that machine.
1803280	1810280	So, for a classical machine, psi is an eigenstate of x, and v of psi is just the eigenvalue.
1810280	1839280	Well, some other facts about v of psi, more general psi, are obvious too. We don't need probability or the Born Rule or anything. For example, if the state is a superposition of eigenstates of x, all of whose eigenvalues are greater than one, then elementary rationality says that it's worth playing, because whatever the outcome, the machine will give you more than the one token that you put in.
1840280	1860280	Similarly, for a superposition with all eigenvalues less than one, it's not worth playing. That is, it's not worth playing in the token-winning sense of the game theorists. You might well play for fun, but then you're being paid partly in fun, so let's ignore that complication.
1861280	1873280	But now, what if the hard case, what if psi is a superposition of two eigenstates, let's say one with eigenvalue below one and one with eigenvalue above one?
1874280	1896280	Well, in collapse quantum theory, with the Born Rule and everything, that tells us that for general states psi, the probabilities of the respective outcomes are those coefficient squared, and then the principle principle tells us to adjust our credences to match those numbers, though it doesn't say why.
1897280	1907280	And probabilistic game theory tells us that a rational player should value playing such a machine the same as if it were guaranteed to produce that expectation value.
1908280	1928280	Again, it doesn't say why. In general, axioms of stochastic theories are not explanatory, which alone should disqualify them from being part of any scientific theory in fundamental science, but I digress.
1928280	1957280	Now, what about without collapse? Well, let's take a simple case of an equal amplitude superposition with eigenvalues x1 and x2, each with amplitude one over root two, so we're aiming to prove without collapse or anything that v of that equal amplitude state, sorry.
1958280	1963280	We'll be the average of x1 and x2. So that's what we want to prove.
1963280	1978280	So here's the proof, a quick and dirty version of the proof. The devil is in the detail, which I'm not going to talk about. The details are extensive, but they lead to the same conclusion.
1978280	1990280	So first of all, we need to note two implications of elementary rationality, not probabilistic in any way, namely equations one and two.
1990280	1999280	I'm stating them for a slightly more general case, but it doesn't matter that the theta is going to be pi by four in the end.
1999280	2010280	So equation two says that v of psi does not depend on the objective exchange value of casino tokens, so long as they're additive.
2010280	2024280	If the casino suddenly declares that it's going to redeem tokens in pounds instead of dollars, the relative order in which a rational player values playing on different machines will not change.
2025280	2033280	So that's one implication of rationality, and the other is expressed in equation one.
2033280	2052280	If two machines use superpositions where each eigenvalue in the expansion of one of them differs by constant k from that in the other, then the rational player's valuation of the two machines also differs by that same constant k.
2052280	2069280	And that's just because. In that case, all the first machine does is physically is the same as what the second one does plus additionally paying out k tokens.
2069280	2091280	Now we make those substitutions there on the slide, and it follows with a bit of algebra that for the equal amplitude state, v of psi is indeed the expectation value of x in that state, and we can prove the same for a general state and that's QED.
2091280	2114280	But look what we've done here in a deeper sense. We've proved the same conclusion about what rational players do as we would have from classical collapse quantum theory, but without assuming that collapse happens.
2114280	2136280	We've proved it without the born rule, without those axioms and all that stuff. So we've done this on the right hand side, whereas with collapse quantum theory we have to go through all that process on the left hand side to get to the same conclusion.
2136280	2165280	So on the right hand side, the only assumptions are elementary rationality and unitary quantum theory without collapse. From the perspective of this talk, that means that we have dispensed with probability, both in nature, in the quantum world and in our minds if we have any credences about the quantum world.
2166280	2190280	Because in nature, as described by quantum theory, there are no stochastic processes and no credences in the sense of beliefs with numerical measures that obey the probability calculus, no credences affect the decisions of any rational person making decisions about quantum systems.
2190280	2213280	That is even better than that. Those decisions now on the right hand side are not only derived, but unlike in the collapse case, they are explained because we don't have to introduce all those unexplained postulates.
2213280	2225280	That also explains why collapse theory, despite its false assumptions, was and is successful in a particular domain of application.
2225280	2244280	So now, let's look again at that list of fundamental applications of probability. We can strike out quantum theory from the list and we can put a tentative mark there about credences too since we now know that they're not needed in this particular application.
2244280	2260280	We've also eliminated probability from the theory of games of chance that use quantum processes where the chance element is generated by quantum indeterminacy.
2260280	2276280	So what about games of chance in general? Well recall what I said at the beginning, probability is a very large sledgehammer with which to crack the egg of modelling things like fair dice.
2276280	2293280	Now we see that the same job could be done by quantum theory as by the impossible physics that they assumed. Since a pseudo random sequence would have served the same purpose, so would a quantum generated sequence.
2294280	2313280	For the same reason, we can strike out the use of probabilities in general decision theory which is just game theory writ large and in actuarial science. I just put that in because it was historically a very early application of probability.
2313280	2331280	It measures, it prepares the system in a state sign and then it measures an observable x on that system. The result is the pale.
2343280	2366280	Just as in game theory, the theory of evolution doesn't depend in any way on true randomness in the mutations. All that matters is that the theory can explain how biological adaptations to an environment can evolve if the mutations aren't systematic, if they don't depend systematically on the environment.
2366280	2383280	Only the selection is supposed to be systematic, that's the essence of the theory of evolution and probability randomness is just a feature of the model convenience so we can strike that out too from the theory of evolution, strike out the theory of evolution.
2383280	2397280	By the way, Chiara has just published a paper about the constructor theory of biology which among other things describes evolution without evoking randomness in any way.
2398280	2424280	Of course, by all these strike outs, I don't mean that the mathematical formalism of quantum theory isn't sometimes useful. I'm saying that the quantities called probabilities in that formalism do not refer to any stochastic random processes in nature nor to anything in rational minds such as degrees of belief or credence,
2424280	2442280	nothing in physics or in minds thinking about physics. In information theory, probability was again originally used as a model for an even simpler thing, namely this could be any message of n bits.
2442280	2458280	Our communication system needs to be able to cope with any message of n bits and we don't know which it's going to be and this was translated in the model to all two to the n strings are equally likely.
2458280	2477280	This has caused all sorts of confusion such as people saying that a state contains maximum information when it has maximum entropy, which is nonsense and so on, but that's another story. Anyway, we can strike it out.
2477280	2506280	I'll just say in passing that constructor theoretic information theory is also something that Chiara and I have recently developed and it does fulfil all the hopes that we have for constructor theory in general including not being subject to the kind of confusion about information that I just mentioned and it unifies classical and quantum information.
2507280	2531280	That was published a while ago. So what's left? Quantum statistical mechanics at least doesn't need probabilities since it has entanglement and decoherence and therefore it can avail itself of what I've just described about quantum theory, the decision theoretic approach.
2532280	2548280	I should say why the universe is in such a state as to make the laws of thermodynamics hold, for example that it's uniform, that it's initially ordered and so on, is a substantive question, but it's not a probabilistic question.
2549280	2560280	So we can strike that out too. So I'll leave striking out classical statistical mechanics as an exercise for the audience.
2561280	2581280	Now, experimental error, that's an interesting case. I think it was historically the earliest application of probability after games of chance and it has some interesting misconceptions in it in addition to probability which one of them is as follows.
2582280	2599280	So it's connected with probabilities. Error processes in experiments are traditionally categorised as random and systematic, but both of those are misleading terms.
2600280	2620280	For simplicity, just imagine a measurement of a constant of nature such as the speed of light. And suppose that we are asked to give an estimate of the best error attainable with a given instrument like Fiso's wheel.
2621280	2634280	Processes that were random with known probabilities would not be sources of error at all in such a case since they could be reduced without limit just by repeating the experiment.
2635280	2652280	So the important errors are the ones that affect experiments through processes whose governing laws are unknown. That is, the laws may be known, but how they affect the experiment is unknown.
2652280	2663280	And those cause systematic errors, so ironically a systematic error is one that obeys known system.
2664280	2682280	So what does it mean to estimate an error caused by the unknown? Traditional to go into probability and subjective probability, but as I've said that's all nonsense, so what can it mean?
2682280	2699280	Well, suppose that a physical constant, let's say, call it chi, is to be measured and that the bound for a given technology is claimed to be epsilon.
2700280	2720280	So if little x is the average of measurements obtained with a particular instrument, well, the best result obtainable with a particular instrument, then the first line, x minus chi, modus of x minus chi is less than epsilon, we're saying.
2721280	2739280	And for simplicity, assume that the individual outcomes that we obtain when we do the experiment repeatedly with different copies of the apparatus and so on are x1 and x2, then we have both x1 and x2 both obey that inequality as well.
2739280	2761280	And then just from some algebra, it follows that the average of x1 and x2, just as in the, if they were random errors, has a smaller error than either x1 or x2 separately, which is a contradiction, because epsilon was supposed to be the best error obtainable with that apparatus.
2762280	2778280	So systematic experimental errors cannot be bounded by any known bound, therefore, among other things, they can't be described by probabilities, nor can our knowledge about them.
2779280	2800280	These unknown variables in science are counterintuitive and often misunderstood because we have been accustomed by Bayesianism and other subjective philosophies to replace real ignorance by fantasy probabilities.
2801280	2811280	But we've just seen that neither physical probabilities nor probability credences can enter the analysis of errors in a fundamental way.
2812280	2818280	So what do we mean when we estimate the error in an experiment?
2819280	2830280	Well, that turns out to be a big question with surprising answers that there's no time to go into here except I'll just briefly mention, I hope to complete a paper on that quite soon.
2831280	2847280	But I'll just briefly mention that what an error estimate really means is it's the error such that if the experimental result turned out to differ from the true value by more than that when the true value is later discovered by some other method,
2849280	2855280	then if it was more than that it would make the theory of the apparatus problematic.
2856280	2868280	So that's in short what an error means, but for present purposes we can just strike out error analysis there.
2869280	2891280	So Brownian motion, that doesn't actually purport to be a fundamental theory since although it has a stochastic law of motion, that's assumed to be an approximation to a more microscopic cause such as impacts from molecules that aren't explicitly treated by the theory of Brownian motion.
2891280	2904280	So that theory is also related to the theory of errors, but in the approximation that the so-called random errors are swamping the systematic errors.
2905280	2919280	Although we've just seen that that's something that cannot be known in a particular case, but if the unknown systematic errors are too large then it's not Brownian motion.
2919280	2921280	So we can strike that out.
2930280	2940280	And with it we can also strike out the applications from high finance that are directly analogous to the theory of Brownian motion.
2941280	2952280	Finally, since none of those other applications of probability now involve stochastic processes, they do not require credences either.
2953280	2966280	It doesn't matter what scientists think, what scientists believe about whether a theory is true or false, so long as they execute rationality.
2967280	2978280	And so Bayesianism and the other subjective interpretations of probability have no remaining scientific function and for these purposes they can be dropped too.
2979280	2989280	Now I hope I have shown you that probability doesn't make sense as a description or explanation of what really happens.
2990280	3004280	It can be a metaphor, it can be a technique for calculation or an approximation in a certain sense, but an approximation to make sense has to be an approximation to something.
3005280	3028280	So if probabilities are to inform decisions in some approximate way, there has to be an explanation rooted in a description of an actual physical world in which events and processes happen, not probably happen, and not just via some ad hoc axioms.
3028280	3054280	So I hope I've also persuaded you that it's right and proper to try to expunge every trace of probability and randomness from the laws of physics and from our conception of the world and from the methodology of science so that we may fully restore realism as well as rationality.
3055280	3065280	It's a simplification, a unification and an elimination of nonsense and it's true.
3066280	3079280	Now I bet there are hard headed instrumentalists in the audience who might be thinking, okay, so this simplification is all very nice and elegant,
3080280	3094280	but since the principal uses of the mathematics of probability are largely unaffected, what really is the benefit of eliminating it at the fundamental level either?
3095280	3102280	Well it's true, fundamental falsehoods don't always rear up and bite you.
3103280	3113280	You could believe in a flat earth as many people did for a long time and that falsehood may never have affected your life or your thinking.
3114280	3133280	On the other hand it might have destroyed the entire human species because belief in a flat earth theory as a description of reality is incompatible with developing, say, technology to avert asteroid strikes.
3134280	3149280	Similarly a belief in probability in quantum theory may not prevent you from developing quantum computers, quantum algorithms in practice,
3149280	3164280	but because probability and the born rule entail fundamental misconceptions about the physical world, they could very well prevent you from developing the successors of quantum theory.
3165280	3174280	And in particular, constructor theory is the framework in which I suspect successors to quantum theory will be developed.
3175280	3181280	Now as I said, constructor theory is incompatible with physical probabilities.
3182280	3185280	So that is my case. Thank you.
3204280	3208280	Many of the things that David alluded to, papers and so forth, easy to find.
3209280	3211280	Okay, I saw one hand go up, so please.
3212280	3223280	I'm sorry, but the slot machine, I'm afraid I'm so far walking out of here with no understanding of how to modify my way of thinking about a single machine that ended up coming in.
3224280	3231280	So if someone asked me, what are the funny numbers in the square roots mean in front of the eigen states in the slot machine?
3231280	3247280	I would say, well, what those funny numbers mean is if I pull the handle lots and lots of times, then on the limit that I do it forever, one third of the time I get this one result and the other two thirds of the time I get this other result.
3248280	3251280	And say, well, which result will you get next?
3252280	3253280	I don't know.
3254280	3259280	I didn't understand how to modify my way of thinking about that based on the stuff you talked about.
3261280	3270280	Well, the idea is that I'm not sure which version of quantum theory you're thinking in terms of possibly collapsed theory in which there is such a thing.
3271280	3274280	I don't know. I want to know how I should think about this.
3275280	3284280	The way you should think about it is not in terms of the outcomes. The outcomes are an emergent property in some complicated way.
3285280	3289280	What those coefficients are, they're just descriptors of the state.
3289280	3292280	The state that the thing is prepared in.
3293280	3305280	So, for example, if it was a spin system, it would be prepared by rotating it in some way with magnetic fields and those coefficients would depend on the angle through which it's been rotated.
3306280	3307280	That's what it actually means.
3308280	3316280	Now, what that causes in our subjective experience, do you need an interpretation of quantum theory for that?
3316280	3327280	Interestingly, all we need, and the right interpretation is the many universal interpretation, but we don't really need to draw on that for these results.
3328280	3332280	We just have to say that the motion is unitary.
3333280	3337280	That's all. That the state exists physically and its motion is unitary.
3341280	3342280	Other question?
3343280	3344280	Hello.
3345280	3347280	I'd like to find out more about what we think about.
3348280	3353280	I can go along with the idea that it's very weird to have them in a fundamental micro-physical theory.
3354280	3358280	If in the future we find some kind of theory which is a deterministic, we have to wrestle with what that means.
3359280	3361280	Or, you know, find out how we don't have them.
3363280	3369280	But as a high level concept, they seem to be useful in some kind of vision philosophy of science which doesn't.
3370280	3372280	It's not trying to talk about the fundamental physics itself.
3373280	3379280	So I'm an observer, people would say, has a credence maybe if they don't know exactly what the micro-state of the real world is.
3380280	3387280	And they have some idea that I think it's within this region, but I've got no reason to differentiate between actual micro-states.
3388280	3395280	So having no reason, so these are two slightly different ways of doing a subjective interpretation.
3396280	3408280	The first one, where you guessed what the probabilities are in some theory and it's going to be an approximation to some microscopic state that you don't know,
3409280	3412280	that's a legitimate way of approximating something.
3413280	3421280	You have guessed what the probabilities are and then you can test if theory says that there's something, you can test whether that's so.
3421280	3431280	When you say you don't know what the micro-states are, then you're trying to derive knowledge from ignorance.
3432280	3438280	And that is simply logically not valid and it's also inconsistent with the probability calculus.
3439280	3448280	It's only by sort of hand-waving ignoring that fact that one can apply Bayesian philosophy in words to things like we don't know what the state is.
3448280	3451280	If we don't know what something is, we don't know what it is.
3452280	3466280	So the standard refutation of that kind of subjective interpretation is if there are three possibilities A, B and C, you don't know anything about which state it's in,
3467280	3472280	then you might say, well bet on whether it's A or either B or C.
3472280	3480280	And then if you say that because you don't know which of those two possibilities is right, that you must give them equal probabilities,
3481280	3485280	then the same is true for the permuted versions and that's inconsistent.
3486280	3489280	It's logically inconsistent so it can't be used for that.
3490280	3493280	The situation is very analogous to the flat earth theory.
3494280	3506280	When you assume that your garden is a plain surface, you're not assuming the flat earth theory, you're just assuming the mathematics of the flat earth theory applied to this process.
3507280	3515280	But there's no way in which you are assuming that the true thing is an approximation to the flat earth. It isn't.
3516280	3535280	So with your decision theoristic argument, which is used to bypass the principle and to derive the Born Rule, you invoke this function V, this evaluation function.
3536280	3548280	However, you also asserted that it had some properties that it was linear in the eigenvalues of the function.
3549280	3550280	Yes.
3551280	3556280	So have you also asserted that the rational entity would…
3557280	3562280	No. We're assuming a rational entity who has linear valuations.
3562280	3565280	So this same issue arises in classical game theory.
3566280	3576280	As I said, a person, a real game player is not the same as the idealised game player of game theory.
3577280	3580280	A real game player has all sorts of other motivations.
3581280	3588280	Otherwise, a real game player would never play a game of chance such as you read where the expectation value of your winnings is negative.
3589280	3601280	So we assume this idealised game player in classical game theory and we assume exactly the same player in the decision theory approach to quantum theory.
3602280	3608280	So it's not because we want to say why people play games.
3609280	3613280	It's just this one particular aspect of game playing that has probability.
3613280	3618280	And it's that that is analogous between the two cases.
3619280	3624280	Okay, but you still made an assertion about how this player would behave, right?
3625280	3630280	So how is that any more elegant tool than the principle?
3631280	3635280	No. The assertion about how the player behaves is the same in both cases.
3636280	3640280	We're analysing how a player who believes a particular thing will behave.
3640280	3647280	We're not saying that any real player actually behaves like that. No real player does exactly.
3648280	3650280	We'll probably take another question.
3651280	3652280	I thought, yeah.
3653280	3662280	David, you were at the foundation of what you're saying is you're eliminating the distinction between epistemological chance and ontological chance.
3663280	3668280	I'm saying that epistemological chance, well, yes I am.
3669280	3675280	I'm saying that neither of them exist, but ontological chance can be a good approximation in some situations.
3676280	3681280	And epistemological chance really should be dispensed with all together.
3682280	3686280	Okay, so if you focus on the epistemological chance there can be two kinds.
3687280	3691280	One where we don't know enough about the system to be able to calculate the outcome.
3692280	3693280	Yes.
3694280	3703280	There's another kind in which, even if we did know everything, we would not be able to compute the outcome because that problem was not computable.
3704280	3705280	Yes.
3706280	3709280	Does that not create an effective ontological chance?
3710280	3716280	Well no, that's a particular situation again in which the probability calculus may be a good approximation.
3717280	3727280	Rather like, if we think about the distribution of the digits of pi, then it's a meaningful approximation to say, well they're going to be random.
3728280	3740280	They're not really random, but the mathematics of them has enough in common with the mathematics of truly random sequences for it to be a good approximation for some purposes, but obviously not for all purposes.
3741280	3747280	So the common feature is just that no matter what we call it, they're just unpredictable whether it's ontological or epistemological.
3748280	3752280	Yes, unpredictability can be modelled by randomness sometimes.
3753280	3761280	Okay, I think we've probably got time for one more question, and then I expect David's happy to hang around for a few minutes afterwards, so those of you who didn't get to ask a question, then he's just coming in front.
3762280	3764280	What have I asked? Do I see one here?
3765280	3780280	Yeah, I just wanted to come back to something that you seem to be wanting to expunge probability from any fundamental physics, and I think we all know that probability is very softly problematic.
3781280	3798280	But you seem to be wanting to do this by replacing it with the decision-theoretic governance in which are made with respect to some admittedly non-existent player or some game that is probably also not being played.
3799280	3811280	So I'm really struggling to see how that is any more desirable than any of the other approaches to the admittedly philosophically problematic probability.
3812280	3819280	Yes, so the main advantage is it doesn't assert anything false about reality.
3820280	3825280	Well, it's asserting that reality has something to do with this thing that we know doesn't exist.
3825280	3850280	No, no, it's just saying that if, so it's taking an idealised game with idealised processes happening both for randomising and for the players, and it's analysing how those players would behave if they believed some rationality, if they conformed to some elements of rationality that have nothing to do with probability.
3851280	3854280	But that entire argument is counterfactual.
3855280	3864280	Yes, it's counterfactual, but then you need an argument to say that a real situation resembles that idealised situation in particular worse.
3864280	3879280	So if I go into a casino to play roulette, obviously I'm not satisfying the axioms of game theory because I'm playing a game which has an expectation value that's negative of winning.
3880280	3905280	On the other hand, if I play poker and I'm good at it and then I wonder whether to draw or not or how much to bet, then I can use game theory because and only because I guess that my real situation resembles the idealised situation in the relevant ways.
3905280	3909280	But it's only as good as that. It's not a theory of reality.
3909280	3919280	So it's based, as you said, on a guess on the correspondence between what you might be doing in certain situations to something that is counterfactual.
3919280	3921280	Yes, exactly.
3921280	3938280	So inside me right now, I'm assuming that there are carbon-14 atoms decaying, that there is no-one doing that game of chance, that there's no sensible way in which you can prepare it to an idealised.
3938280	3943280	Making that game of chance, talking about if there's length of time, will take any given moment to decay.
3943280	3945280	I think we'll just let David reply to that.
3946280	3962280	OK, well, you can. If you want to work out the half-life, then you simply have to imagine the situation in which these game players bet on how long it will take and what the rational thing for them to do is, and you'll find that the rational thing for them to do is to bet on an exponential decay.
3962280	3964280	And that's the problem.
3966280	3968280	So, once more, if we could do that.
3975280	3978280	Thank you.
