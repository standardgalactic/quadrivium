I'm so humbled and thrilled to be here today with Matthew Siegel and Michael Levin.
Michael Levin is an American developmental and synthetic biologist at Tufts University
where he is the Vannevar Bush Distinguished Professor, director of the Allen Discovery Center
at Tufts and at the Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology.
He's also co-director of the Institute for Computationally Designed Organisms with
Josh Bongard. Dr. Levin received dual bachelor's degrees in computer science and biology from
Tufts University and a PhD in genetics from Harvard University. His group uses computational
and experimental approaches and this is very important because that's basic for Dr. Levin is
that things have an experimental approach to understanding diverse intelligence in a range
of evolved engineered and hybrid living systems and they develop conceptual frameworks for
understanding cognition in unconventional embodiments such as the collective intelligence
of cells and use them to drive applications in birth defects, regenerative medicine,
cancer, and synthetic bioengineering. And Matthew David Siegel is a transdisciplinary
researcher, author, and teacher applying process philosophy across the natural and social sciences
including the study of consciousness. He's associate professor in the philosophy, cosmology,
and consciousness program at California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, California.
You can find out more about his research and writing at footnotes2playto.com that's a two
and also on Twitter which where I have a lot of interesting conversations with both of these
gentlemen. So I'm really thrilled to have both of you here. Welcome to the meeting code.
Nice to be here. Thank you. Yeah, thanks Karen. And I had asked each of you to talk about
what you might like to learn from each other. And now where did I put it?
Oh, this is great. I had the questions right in front of me. But you probably remember what your
questions were. So maybe I'll just let you get started. I know that, Matt, you had a question
about Dr. Levin's basic viewpoint of, I can't believe I lost that thing.
It's a problem with paper. Yeah, that's the problem with paper. So I'm going to let you
get started, Matt. Why don't you ask your big question that you had and then maybe by that time
I'll be able to find number two. Sure. Yeah, so I think whenever philosophers and scientists
enter into dialogue, it's important to clarify the relationship between these disciplines,
right, and make sure that we're working from the same basic sense of how we can learn from each
other. And so, you know, from my point of view, as a philosopher seeking a metaphysical scheme
in terms of which we can interpret every aspect of our experience, including science,
I'm not here to try to sort of tell scientists what the proper concepts to use in approaching
and operationalizing certain knowledge sets. I'm here to learn from science and to generalize from
what the special sciences are telling us, including biology and physics and the special
subdisciplines within biology and physics, and to generalize from those findings,
so that we can learn what the implications are for the broader questions of the nature of the
universe. And I'm also interested in sort of looking at the epistemological presuppositions of
science, because I think historically, since the scientific revolution in the 17th century and the
basically mechanistic and reductionistic approach that drove science so successfully for a few
centuries, there was a sense in which the kind of universe that scientists were describing
didn't really allow for human minds that were coming up with all this knowledge, right. And so,
part of what I would want to do as a philosopher is understand nature, drawing on science, such that
mind would be something likely to be possible in this universe, right, because obviously if
science is possible, there must be intelligent minds in the universe. And so we don't really want,
I think it's a problem if our science is describing the universe in a way that makes minds
highly, highly unlikely. And so that's why I'm so excited about your work, because you're trying to
generalize this notion of mind and agency and intelligence, so that in some ways goes all the
way down, that there's a continuum and gradual development through processes of evolutionary
learning, so that the scientists can understand themselves as an example of the very type of
systems that they're studying, right. And so, you know, my, I think my first question for you,
Michael, would be, how do you, is this how you would understand the relationship between
philosophy and science ideally? Or do you see it somewhat differently?
Yeah, no, I see it quite similarly. And to me, the key fact that tells us how to
how to think about these areas, you know, science and philosophy together is basically the fact of
developmental biology. So if not for that, we could have two divergent sort of worlds. And
many people think we do have these two worlds where we think about, you know, kind of classical
philosophy of the adult human, the, you know, sort of the moral agent and, you know, things you know,
and so on. And then, and then there's physics and chemistry and things like that. And the thing
that ties these together in a remarkable way is developmental biology, because each one of us
has taken that journey from chemistry and physics to being a complex metacognitive mind. And that
happens slowly and gradually. And you can watch it happen with your own eyes. In the case of a
frog, you can watch the whole thing from beginning to end. In the case of a human, it takes a little
more instrumentation, but you can still watch it. And so each of us was once a quiescent oocyte,
a little blob of chemistry of chemistry. And now we are whatever it is that we are in that process
happens slowly. So, so, so to me, these things are fundamentally merged because whatever, whatever
it is, whatever philosophical approaches we have to what, what we are and how we should think about
the outside world and so on, we have to realize that we are continuous with what we call the
chemistry and physics and, you know, supposedly mindless matter, which I'm not sure there is
any such thing. But right. And so that continuity, I find just binds the two fields in a way that
cannot be be untangled. I like it. Yeah, definitely. Because developmental morphogenesis has been not
totally left out of our understanding of biology, but it's taken kind of a backseat
in the 20th century with the focus on genetics, right? And I think your work is blazing a trail in,
in, in terms of bringing this, these factors back into the picture, which I think really does change
our understanding of evolution more as a learning process and not just a passive selection mechanism
that neo Darwinism would suggest, right? And I think that's, it's so exciting to see that what
you're, how you're moving the ball forward on that. Yeah, I mean, another, you know, another thing,
another area of interaction is that I think a lot of, I mean, most of this was already available,
you know, sort of conceptually, but now practically, we can really show that a lot of categories that
people who are having these sort of philosophical and conceptual discussions, people throw around
categories, a machine versus a living organism, right? So people will say, well, machines can't
this and that living organisms can do this and that, and robots is something else and, and evolved
versus engineered completely different. Like the, to taking evolution seriously, taking developmental
biology, bioengineering as taking these things seriously tells you immediately that those categories
are no good, right? These, these, these binary crisp categories that people love to philosophize
about, I don't think there's any argument to be made anymore that they so-called carve nature at
the joints. They're just not, you know, we can, we can now do lots of experiments that tell you
immediately that if you're operating with those categories, you're tied up in knots. You've got
pseudo problems that you're never going to resolve with that frame of looking at things. And so I,
I also like that. I like the fact that these, these, these advances. So I kind of see the philosophy
in the, in the science as a spiral because they help each other out, right? And so, and so they,
they sharpen, and a lot of people don't see it that way. I've had, I've had many people tell me,
you know, they, I'll, you know, talk about some data, some, some, something we've, we've discovered
and people will say, that's pretty cool. But I wish you wouldn't talk about all this philosophy
stuff. Like, like that just, like, don't do any of that. Just give us the, you know, just give us
the, the science and the, and the data. And it's, it's kind of like the old joke of telling the
publisher, you know, we'll just publish all the best sellers. Like, right, after, after we've done
the thing, then you can say, well, I see how this works. Well, then we don't need philosophy. No,
but the, we only did that thing because of a particular, you know, philosophical way of
looking at things. And that's why I think it's really critical. I think the philosophy is absolutely
critical. And I think the, the, the empirical work is critical. And together they can, they can spiral
up, I think.
One of the, one of the philosophical questions that you wanted to ask, Matt, you said,
Plato's space of forms, which is becoming increasingly more relevant as we discover ways
to probe the latent space around biological objects, and find forms and behaviors that
cannot be explained by evolutionary selection histories. And I just wanted to clarify the
question a little bit. When you talked about the latent space around biological objects,
are you talking about the same kind of thing where Anna Soto talks about the impact of the
environment or the matrix in which something develops or Darcy Thompson's work on attractor
spaces, or do you mean something else when you say latent space? Well, closer to what Darcy, so,
so I think Thompson was on to this in an important way, but, but I think it's not quite what Anna
says. I'll give you, I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about. People often ask me,
where do, so let's just talk about anatomies, but it's also true for behavior and physiology and so
on. A specific anatomical target morphology, like a particular, let's say, let's say a salamander
limb or an embryo that has a particular shape. And if you deviate it from that shape, it will
regenerate and try to get back to that shape, when it gets back to that shape, it stops. So these
sorts of set points for these kind of homeostatic capabilities, people often ask, where do those
come from? So where does the shape come from? And the typical answer is for most natural things,
the answer is, well, evolution, selection. So the reason frogs look froggy is because for
eons, they were selected for this particular shape that fits a particular niche, solves a set of
problems successfully and survives. And that's where it comes from. It comes from that history.
But now we know, and again, really, we knew this before, but now we can really, it's right in our
face now, that we can make, for example, Xenobots, or which have a wild type frog genome, and they
have a novel structure, they have novel behaviors like kinematic self-replication that nobody's seen
before in the living world. We can make all kinds of unusual novel constructs. And the question is,
where do those forms come from? Because the answer, well, eons of selection is clearly wrong in this
case. I mean, the cells, of course, did evolve on Earth, but they didn't evolve in the context of
being selected to be a good Xenobot. There's never been any good Xenobots, and so there's never been
selection to be a good Xenobot. And so you have many examples where there are new ways to solve
problems, new forms, new behaviors, new physiological competencies that arise out of some space of
possibilities, of which the standard example that we're looking at, let's say a particular embryo,
is just one little tiny glimpse of that space. And of course, people have studied developmental
plasticity before, and here are several different ways that this plant can come out, depending on
the water level of the environment and things like that. This is more than that. This isn't just
developmental plasticity. This is pushing cells into coherent, large-scale behaviors in various
spaces, including anatomical space, physiological space, and so on, that have never existed before,
and that you can't predict from the genome, and you can't predict from that. I have many
examples that I go through in my paper. So when people ask, where do these things come from,
it's kind of a subtle thing. And I always lean back to, on this example, this the Galton board.
So you take a board, and you bang them at your nails into it, and you take a bucket of marbles,
and you dump them in, and they go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then they land on the
bottom. Well, they always land in this beautiful bell curve, to always get the same shape. And
so you could ask the same question, where does that shape come from? And you could say, well,
is it in a wood? Not really. Is it in the description of the nails and the metal of the nails?
No, not really. Like, to me, it sounds like, and Andreas Wagner is another biologist who talks
about this stuff, it comes from the same place where the truths of mathematics come from. It
comes from the same place that tells you what the distribution of crimes is, and the truths of
number theory, and all this stuff that isn't anywhere in the physical world. In fact, all the
facts of the physical world, I think, could be completely different, and all those things would
still be true. So, to me, it sounds like we're right back to, and I think Thompson was onto this,
in particular, the part of his book where he draws animals on these grids, and then he does this
deformation of these mathematical deformation of these grids, and you get, and what you get is
other existing species. I mean, we've done things like this too, in the lab, we've actually done
this, and this really does suggest that there's some kind of a latent space. And now, actually,
the machine learning folks are all over this stuff, because you can, just as a modern example,
with one of these programs that draws, it makes pictures from words, right? And so, you can say,
I want this and that in the style of, I don't know, Salvador Dali, or Mark Shigala, whatever,
and it'll give you something in that style. So, that's already cool that it can go outside of
the particular paintings that that person had done. But you can also make up a name,
and you can say, I want 10 paintings in the style of whatever, and they'll give you paintings that
all look like they come from somebody with the same style. Where is that? They're not copying
that from some particular person that they've seen before. They're exploring this latent space
that they've constructed by looking at other examples of art. So, this notion of having a
space into which we can only see little tiny glimpses by the few examples that we've seen,
I think is really important. And I'd love to hear what, you know, I certainly don't have a background
in classical philosophy. So, I'd love to hear, you know, what did people say about this for
mathematics? Because in the end, I think that matters a lot. For example, is evolution really
searching the very difficult space of microstates for biological systems? I don't think so.
What I think evolution is searching for is a much nicer space of simple machines that
pull down all kinds of free gifts from the laws of physics, the laws of computation,
the laws of geometry. And what evolution does is optimize the hardware. But there's a ton of
heavy lifting that is done elsewhere, so to speak. I lack the vocabulary for it, really.
But, you know, it's like a final example. And then I'd love to hear what Matthew thinks.
Just as a dumb example, suppose you're evolving a triangle, a particular kind of triangle,
right? There's an environment and only that kind of triangle is really fit. And so,
you crank through a bunch of generations of the population and you finally find that first
angle and that works. And then you crank through some more and you find the second angle, you're done.
You don't need to look for the third angle because the three angles of a triangle have to
add up to 180. So, it's not philosophy. It's very practical. Evolution just saved one-third of its
effort in finding that solution. You didn't need to look for it. Why didn't you need to look? Where
did that come from? That amazing... And the same thing that we see in Zenobots and these other
creatures where you make a very small change and you get a lot, quote-unquote,
for free with novelty, right? Things that it's very likely that the evolutionary history had
never seen before. So, that aspect that that's what I'm really curious about is where does all
this stuff come from? Can we use these synthetic biology and other AI for sure and then synthetic
bioengineering as a kind of telescope to sort of peer around that space and dig around and see
what else is there? Can we map out the structure of that space the way that mathematicians? I saw a
map of mathematics ones where they sort of have all the different fields of math and how they
relate to each other. So, you know, that's just one of the things that's up there. There's probably
all kinds of other things in that latent space. So, anyway, that's what I'm asking about.
Yeah. So, Plato obviously had his theory of forms and as a high-level summary of what I think
needs to happen here is we need to evolutionize Plato. And so, the problem with Plato's view is
that it was this static realm of ideas and everything physical in our experience is a pale
imitation or an attempt to mimic this perfect realm of forms and they're eternal, right? They
never change and the ancient Greeks had a very static understanding of nature. There was no
speciation. It was pretty much an essentialist in the sense that the organisms that exist now
all have their proper place in this teleological order. This would be to speak in more Aristotelian
terms but Aristotle is kind of like the first Neoplatonist and so there's a lot of continuity
here. There's this great chain of being in Aristotle's view of the cosmos, right? From
minerals to plants to animals to humans and then on up to this sort of super
lunar sphere of higher types of beings on up to the thought thinking itself which would be like
this divine mind that everything else sort of emanates from. Now, to evolutionize this Platonic
or Aristotelian view is kind of like tipping it out at side, right? And horizontalizing what was
conceived of in this vertical way and showing how these forms can emerge in the course of
evolutionary history but there's a lot to work out in the details here about how this actually
works and I think in the 20th century the best figure I've been able to find who's addressing
these issues is Alfred North Whitehead who, you know, Karen shared the name of my blog Footnotes
to Plato. He's the one who famously says all of Western philosophy is a series of footnotes or
can be understood as a series of footnotes to Plato but Whitehead really wants to
evolutionize Plato and the way he does this is by pointing out that
mechanistic science and we can talk about the mechanism organism thing. I'll just briefly say
I think that organic thinkers don't dismiss mechanism. They say it's a subset of this
more general self-organizing dynamic. Obviously living organisms need to make use of mechanisms
to do what they do but when you flip it and talk about what mechanistic thinkers tend to say they
don't think there's any such thing as organism it's all just purposeless mechanisms that kind of
fall together into place because of a series of accidents that get preserved in the biological
world because they're you know selected because of the enhanced fitness that they provide.
So from Whitehead's point of view mechanistic science that dismissed any
or didn't really take self-organization seriously and was more just you know the parts fall into
place because of eternal laws. This mechanistic approach to science was based totally on what
Aristotle called efficient causes sort of things banging into each other and had no room for
formal or final causation and there was good reason for in the history of science and the
emergence of science for the first scientists to really want to distance themselves from this idea
of purpose in nature and teleology and whatnot because the sort of scholastic way that those
ideas were deployed was kind of naive and inhibited our understanding of the natural
world around us and so it turned out when you bracket questions of purpose and final causality
and stuff and just study nature as if it were determined by efficient causes and you use mathematical
modeling to do that you can make a lot of progress especially in terms of instrumental
knowledge like you can develop models that are highly predictive and so we can get all
sorts of technology out of this and you know that's been the story of science for the last
few hundred years but when you leave out formal and final causes then you end up in the problem I
was describing when we first started that it's very difficult to understand how science could
be possible how there could be minds like ours capable of doing science if there's only efficient
causation operating in this universe and so how do you bring formal causality and final causality
back into this naturalistic picture I think that's that's the challenge and you know Whitehead
does that by describing evolution not just as a you know I don't mean just biological evolution I
mean a general picture of evolution cosmologically speaking there's an accumulation of facts in the
past that just as a mechanist would say like Laplace or something everything that's happened in
the past has has a an impact on what's happening in the present just causal chain of influence and so
evolution is a process of the accumulation of all these facts of history but there's also
there's possible forms open in the future that are that that that field of possible forms in the
future is constantly being adjusted as these facts of the past accumulate but we can't understand
the relationship in the present between that past of facts and that future of forms purely in terms
of efficient causation because what's missing in the mechanistic picture is is the agency that's
operative in the present that can search this field of possibilities in the future and so the
challenge is how to understand that agency in a naturalistic way that doesn't rely on you know
what Dan Dennett called skyhooks in Darwin's dangerous idea right which would be a conception
of final causality that would imagine it as a kind of disembodied mind reaching in as if it
can as if it's in the future already and it's like a retro causality or something and it's almost
like construing final causality in term as though it were just another kind of efficient causality
but working in reverse from the future and I think we need a different way of imagining
final causality that doesn't just reduce it to what efficient causality is doing in reverse
and so obviously well maybe it's not obvious but in Whitehead's picture at least the future is
open he's not a deterministic thinker there is real room for novelty here despite the accumulation
of the facts of the past that influence what happens in the present and despite the fact that
the present must conform to the past there's room in the present for a kind of agency which
is operates differently at different scales depending on the complexity of the system that's
exhibiting this agency but what agency is is yes it's inheriting and conforming to the past which
is what constitutes memory but it's also searching the future and in the present there's some kind of
confluence between future forms of possibility and past facts that are already actualized and
Whitehead's whole philosophy is an attempt to what he it's an attempt to devise what he calls
a cell theory of actuality such that agency is always understood to operate in a cellular way
and he's using a biological metaphor here but he ends up generalizing it beyond just biology
to talk about quantum events using the same set of categories that we would talk about
cellular biology but also the same set of categories would also apply to our own conscious
experience of being conscious decision makers that there's a there's a single set of categories
that applies across all of these scales and it's about a continuum of agency inheriting the past
searching these this field of future possibilities and so when we think about biological development
and morphogenesis this is obviously a collective form of intelligence that has a goal in mind
as a collective and like where is that goal that that form that finished form it like as
you're always pointing out Michael the cells know when to stop growing when they've reached this
this form that they have in mind and on some level that form is inherited by you could say the
genome but it's obviously not totally stored in the genome because you can change the genome and
the form would still be there the cells will find it you could say that it's stored in the
whole environmental context in some ways and I mean and this this is where I could pivot to your
work with Chris Fields and others on the free energy principle and the agency of the environment
in all of this yeah which I'd love to hear more from you about but but I'll pause there and see
if these thoughts are landing no no yeah super interesting just just on the on the last bit
so the thing about the environment yes but the environment is massively under determined right
so so xenobots live in basically the same empty water dish as as frog embryos you can't really
pin the the shape of them on the environment per se the thing is that now now now going back to
you know where do these patterns store the funny thing is that we can now see them
so so we can actually see these so so just in the in the case of the planarian we can actually
visualize the pattern memory that tells them how many heads to have we have the technique you can
actually see it and that's and the reason we know that's what it is is that if you go ahead and rewrite
that pattern they'll build something else they'll build animals with two heads or no heads or you
know so we I mean this is just scratching the surface of what's possible of course but we're
starting to unravel the actual like like that that idea that there's a representation and you know
of course molecular biologists don't like this at all because they like they like emergence and
complexity and that's it they don't they don't want to have the system that has some kind of
representation of a future state that it's working towards but we can actually see those in the same
way that neuroscientists can read the electrical activity of the brain and see those in the case
of you know behaving creatures so so so the information structures are there and we can
sort of start to decode some of their physical correlates but I wonder if so so this is the
thing I wanted to kind of ask you about I wonder if the whole the business with them you know
the the four the Aristotle and the four types of causes and all that could we is maybe this is
crazy but is it possible that what what if what if instead of having sharp categories here are
four different types of causes instead of that what if we draw we put we put an agent in this like
and I like this diagram I use it for my cognitive light bone thing it's almost the Minkowski diagram
where you've got the you know three dimensionals of space here one dimension of time is here right
and so you put your thing on and all you're going to do instead of having sharp categories what
you're going to do is have progressive distance from the here and now of this agent so we could say
you know if you're a if you're a if you're a bowling ball what I really need to know is the
sum of the forces on you right now so so basically I'm operating on the causes that are in a very
tight you know cone around that system if you're a mouse in a field it's not enough for me to know
what your experience what's around you right now because you may have memories and previous
experiences and all kinds of other stuff that's going to determine what you're going to do and
right and if and if you're a human the answer the best answer to why did you do what you did
might be something like world war two that's why right so so it might be this giant thing that's
far away in space and time and or you know and so if we if we back off from if we back off from the
idea that um you always have to look at the lowest level right which is you know that that's kind of
how um that's how Dan Dennett analyzes free will as he says look when you zoom in you only see two
things you see either either hard determinism or random neither of those things is what we mean by
free will so therefore okay that's I mean that works if if you're committed to the fact that
everything has to be at the lowest level if you back off to some of the work you know for example
Eric whole and and julio tononi and and those kind of guys who are now like showing very rigorously
that there are many systems in which the higher levels tell a more causally impotent story than
the lowest levels then then it all becomes a matter of prediction and control from some kind of
outside observer and that observer can draw not necessarily four specific um you know bands around
this thing but just a smooth sort of so you can ask this question like in order to understand this
particular system how far away are in space and time are the causes that I need to most efficiently
relate to it that would be that would be how I would do phrase all this I would say that it's not
discreet it's continuous and as an engineer like that's my approach to all this is as an engineer
when you're telling me something about the uh cognitive makeup of a system which are really
or claims you know yeah it's intelligent or yet has you know cognitive capacities whatever
what what I am hearing are engineering protocols you're telling me that I can rewire it or no
you can do better than that you can read you can change the set points the things the thermostat
cool or no you can do better than that you can give it rewards and punishments even better
no you can do better than that you could give it um a co-cogent arguments and it'll go and you know
and so so what I hear what what I hear from these claims is uh how far away do I need to
what do I need to know in this space time diagram to be able to optimally relate to that system
so what do you think of that as as a kind of uh you know as a way to like modernize these these
these sharp categories you know it always bothered me that they were supposed to be like
you know that they sound so discreet I just kind of see a distance I think this idea of a kind of
cognitive light cone as you call it is is wonderful and it's very convergent with Whitehead's
understanding of you know what he calls actual occasions of experience and how they
complexify over the course of of evolution because of the relationships that they enter into
which he calls societies or you know you call them collectives cell collectives or what have you
and so I think that's that's right on and I mean the thing about
Aristotle's for causes or reasons you could even translate the the Greek term he's using there
um is that these are when you ask um questions about entities or processes of nature for Aristotle
like these are the four basic ways that you can get at why something happens um and it's not that
there are some sorts of entities that are purposeful and other sorts of entities that are not um so
the continuum you're trying to describe I think is perfectly consistent well I shouldn't say
perfectly consistent but it's at least in in fruitful conversation with the perspective like
that Aristotle would talk about but yeah at the end of the day you know he would differentiate
between like you know a human being has like um different levels of um agency and sort of ontological
layering within within them we have we have the mineral realm within us which is our the matter
we're made of and we also have the sort of plant like nature this vegetative soul um we have an
animal like nature the sentient soul and then we also have this intellectual soul which is where
our reason comes from and you know yeah it's kind of they seem like separate sorts of things when
what we would want in an evolutionary context is more of a continuum here but I think to do that
to switch perspective successfully we end up having to say that whatever we mean by reason
or rationality this capacity to be persuaded by arguments in human beings obviously that depends
on language and stuff but the the germ of whatever that capacity is must be rooted pretty far deep
in our biology if not even more deeply right and so you have to bite that bullet if you want
continuity I would say otherwise you end up in a situation where again the epistemological
presuppositions of science start to become challenging because whatever mind is in human
beings seems to be discontinuous with our biology and the nature of the physical world out of which
that biology arises right does that does that problem make sense yeah yeah yeah it makes sense
I mean the discontent can I just jump in with two small things here to kind of help me clarify
what's happening um and also maybe to reduce some of these big ideas into something that's
one one big idea and that would be there's something that Jordan Peterson always says
which I think scales in every area of this and that is the ideal is the judge
and it's really a very simple idea and it doesn't have anything to do with
doesn't have anything to do with metaphysics actually he's he's talking at the scale of psychology
the idea of whatever it is that you want to be or whatever it is that you look at that you admire
is something that is constantly judging you because either you're not achieving it or if you're moving
towards it how close have you gotten or if you've overshot it how far did you overshoot it so you're
always adjusting to this ideal and I think that scales all the way down to particles it scales
all the way down to cells your morphogenesis when the undifferentiated cells are given their
subroutine and they go off to build an arm there's some sort of an ideal towards which they're working
and that ideal is constantly judging whether or not they're getting there and as a collective
they're working together towards that and and I think that this connects to this idea that you
have of the distance because with the bowling ball the distance is very short the ideal distance is
very short because those are physical laws that are absolutely determinative but by the time you
get up to the human scale we're affected not only by our own personal history but by the
history of the universe and everything that we think and do right so the distance of the ideal
is much further from us and that makes the path forward very much more complex and this made me
think about your xenobots what is it that causes that form for the xenobots it's not the matrix
that they're in because other things can arrive in that same matrix that they're floating around in
but there's another idea that I learned from art that was very important to me and that is
constraint or limitation produces creativity and the way they used to say in the old days
necessity is the mother of invention so the one thing that those xenobots have absolutely is
necessity they've been dumped in this medium and if they're going to live if they're going to continue
living they've got to get together and do something so this collective intelligence
is being driven by necessity and necessity is producing the creativity that allows them to
find that form where the form exists I don't know but I think it's the necessity that's driving it
so that's very interesting I completely agree with the necessity bit and I'll say something
about it but you know just just for the for the xenobot example just so we're clear on the biology
actually the cells could have remained independent so when we when we dissociate all the skin cells
they could have sat there independently they could have done nothing they could have crawled away from
each other they could have formed a two-dimensional monolayer like in cell culture there's many
things they could have done so and they would have lived they would have they would have continued
to live they're not under under some kind of external survival pressure to join up together
okay that's new information but yeah yeah they could have they could have done other things
but but I love the constraint idea and I like it for the following reason I mean this this links up
to something that Matthew said a minute ago which is this when when you are a brand new
living being starting off in this in this universe one thing you don't have time or energy to do is
to track microstates like simuloplasty and demon you don't have the energy to do that you don't
you'll get eaten if you're sitting there trying to calculate all the microstates so what you have
is tremendous pressure selection pressure for systems that coarse grain and are able to see
higher levels of what's going on around them so you need to organize your experience and
into and and chunk it up into macroscopic states that you are then going to track and decide what
you're going to pay attention to and how you're going to prioritize it because if you if you if you
try to um if you if you try to track the microstates you'll be you'll be you'll be for two reasons one
one is if you know just limitations of time and energy and then there's a more interesting reason
but but you'll you'll be dead very very quickly so so I think there is this this this um the pressure
of necessity I think drives the ability of life to see higher levels this is cool I think that one
of the reasons why chemists and physicists often don't see the agency and the things they they're
looking at is because they're using low agency tools so so there needs to be some resonance between
the thing you're probing the the the world with and and what you're hoping to see so if you're using
rulers and magnetometers and things like this these are very low agency tools all you're going to
ever see is low agency chemistry and physics but life has agency detectors we have to because
otherwise you can't survive and so what we have are the ability to see these higher levels to
do you know well or poorly but usually pretty well they they uh living things have to be able to um
coarse grain in the in the world and then once you see these things and you start to make models
of their behavior um uh you know that's a cell and it does certain things and that's my neighbor's
cell and that's it does certain things or that's a cat that does certain things then eventually
you can sort of turn that around on on yourself and say well I'm a thing and I do things I there's
I have a model of myself as an agent and so this leads to a weird kind of thing I proposed which is
that any organism or being it might be completely an engineer you know an engineer thing it doesn't
have to be biological but anything that evolves under resource constraint under necessity is going
to fundamentally uh believe in free will I'm not saying it has it I'm saying it believes in it because
because fundamentally in order to survive you have to be able to you have to get good at telling
stories about agents that do things you cannot survive with stories of uh all the particles
to sort of move around on you know under like that you you you will not live that way and so
and so anything that survives has to be good at telling these causal stories of agents with with
agencies you know and so uh and so that's I think that's how we get to this to this um
in place where where we are where where it's impossible for us to do things like you know
you might say you don't believe in free will for example but if we go to a restaurant and you know
the waitress comes along and she says you know what what what what are you gonna have we don't have
the ability to sit back and see what the big bang ordained for us to eat today like you don't have
that ability you will just you know we we we are fundamentally do doers um and I think it's
because of that I think it's and and that's it the thing I realized just last week is that
it's funny I I think I put all the emphasis in this kind of agency thing on the doing but actually
most of the field I think has been mostly talking about the feeling aspect they're not the output
the input side because for example we have this idea of what's it like to be right that's a famous
thing in philosophy of mind and and we haven't we somebody came up with a theory of epiphenomenalism
this idea that we just feel stuff but we don't actually ever do anything right that you know
there is what's the opposite I'm not aware of that there's an opposite of this you know so people
have realized so people do have a theory of well maybe you're just perceiving and and you know you
really are but the rest of it is fiction but nobody's that I know of has said it the other way
around but but I actually think the doing is the is is you know the more I mean of course they all
work together but but but the doing is is also really critical and that's why so so coming back
to this to to to something that Matthew was saying I think one interesting thing if you if you do try
just imagine for a second a being that was a you know a being that is a Laplacian demon let's say
it was possible I mean for many reasons it's not but let's say it's possible one of the things that
that type of there are two interesting things I think that that type of being couldn't do
and they're related what one thing they couldn't do is for example they couldn't play a game of
chess with you because all of the microstates of what happens next are equivalent to them in terms
of their value they there is they don't believe in chess pieces they don't believe in the chess board
all they see is atoms and there's no such thing as the king or the position of you know dominating
the center or all this other stuff and there's they don't believe in these in these higher level
they don't track these these higher level things so how do they choose their next move
how do they coarse grain all the molecular things that come that that that are grouped into a move
a valid move and in fact the best next move you know all the microstates it's very I don't see
how they would have a preference over the microstates if they don't understand the groupings of the
macrostates and that leads that also leads me to uh to to this if you if if you're very good at
following uh like like a Laplacian demon you're very good at following what happens next any given
system that somebody prepares for you you can in a deterministic universe you could say what will
happen next you can do that but what you can't do is prepare the interesting system in the first
place you are you are a passive you know there's prediction but there's no pre-invention and and
just as a kind of a dumb example of this what I mean is you know there's this you know the cellular
automaton the game of life right so you got these very simple rules about whether whether the individual
pixels are on or off and then if you follow these rules our visual system starts to see interesting
things like gliders you know these patterns that go up and what somebody and so and so what what
somebody did was was uh create a configuration that results in the Turing machine that uses these
gliders gliders as information signals I mean it's this amazing giant thing but so so if you were
a determinist in that world you could say there aren't any gliders all there is is individual
pixels turning on and off according to some rules and if you give me a prepared starting condition
I will tell you what all the what what it's going to do from here to eternity I can calculate
this is true but what they're never going to do is is is design the Turing machine because they
don't believe in gliders right and so I think there is this this and it's you know it all
stems from the same place which is that if you're going to be uh active surviving interesting if
you're if you're if you're going to persist in this world you have to get good at coarse-graining
into mesoscale you can't just stay at the lower levels because because of the because of the
necessity that that that you were just talking about and you're never going to do anything you're
always going to be reactive you're never going to set up any anything interesting if you again for
the same reason that the that the Laplacian demons are not going to invent they can predict stuff you
make but they're never going to you know have enough preferences to make anything interesting on
their own so that's you know that's that's that's what I've been thinking about this necessity but
I actually think it's really important well the other thing determinists don't take into account
is anomaly I mean that what you do when you when you create a designer tadpole and you screw up
their eyes or or you know something like that you you've injected anomaly into the system
but anomaly happens even without a scientist coming along and injecting anomaly into the system
anytime you trip over a rock or or anytime a wind comes along and pushes the bowling ball off the
rack or something anomaly has come in and that has set up something that has disturbed things
when you take a when you take a zygote and you scratch through it and then all of a sudden you
have two and maybe zygote is the wrong word but anyway you end up with with two organisms instead
of one organism developing those are the injection of anomaly into the system and
um the thing that has always fascinated me is the way all these things scale
all the way from social systems through humans down to particles and what got me onto that
is my own study of creativity and the elements and principles of design seems to be a key that
I can use to interpret whitehead or Jordan Peterson or or you with with um with your work in
developmental and regenerative medicine and so forth and Jordan Peterson's book maps of meaning
is particularly interesting to me because I can read a paragraph from there and I can say oh this
is exactly what Michael Levin is talking about I just want to read you one sentence here the change
that upsets and this would be an anomaly the change that upsets the presently predictable and
orderly also means potential or advancement into a more promising future the unexpected
is information itself information necessary for the constant expansion of adaptive competence
so all all the adaptivity that you're talking about that seems to be built into
organisms that allows them to face
risk or anomaly or or danger or someone injecting change into the system
that's actually advancing information it's creating more opportunity even if it creates
more risk down the road and I think determinists don't accept that maybe they don't maybe they
think anomalies are also determined I mean yeah I think that's what they would say right I think
I think they would say that the wind that pushed the bowling ball could have been if you if you
could just track those air molecules you know and and of course you know chaos the theory makes
that very very hard in practice but but I think I think they that's that's what they would say
but you can you can look at a human situation where somebody sets off a bomb someplace and
that has ramifications in a thousand different directions for all the people and for the
infrastructure and for the atmosphere and all of those things was that also determined because
that has injected anomaly into everything everywhere but I think you know just to sort of
steelman it a little bit I think what they would say is that if you were tracking the molecules
in that person's head you would have been able to predict it that's what they would say that it's
you know there's some neurotransmitters that zigged instead of zagged and you should have been
able to predict that this whole issue for me of determinism in the scientific picture of the
universe is I think a side effect of this kind of deistic hangover although for scientists were
deist right and so God is this external engineer set the laws of physics and then the the universe
just rolls forward a bunch of atoms you know obeying these laws of physics and and for Newton
or Descartes God doesn't reach in and have to tinker with the machine because the machine was
designed by this perfect being to just be able to do everything it does without any interference
and this deistic picture of God I think plays into the some of the epistemological presuppositions
of this type of science that the observer is imagined to be outside the system reaching in
tinkering and so on and 20th century science from physics on up has just demolished the idea
that an observer can passively measure a system when we observe a system we're part of the very
same system that we're trying to observe you can't even you know in quantum theory this is
it's on the one hand doesn't need to be a big mystery that you need to use photons to measure
quantum system and that the photons going to interfere with the system you're trying to
measure and so you end up with limitations on the amount of information you can get
because you're changing what you want to measure by trying to measure it and it's it's like kind of
obvious but because there is this again a sort of deistic theology underlying science for a few
hundred years it's very easy to leave this idea out or this it's not even an idea it's a fact
that to measure something you got to get in there and interfere with the system and so I like to
say we need to reimagine science like reimagine physics as endophysics like we're within what
we're trying to study biology endo biology we're within what we're trying to study and a lot that
has a lot of implications but if I can go back to the comment from Jordan Peterson about the ideal
because I think I know he's read some whitehead he references him once in a while it seems to me
though I wouldn't say that the ideal is the judge I would say that the agent is the judge and the
ideal is the standard upon which that judgment is based and this gets back to Whitehead's view of
what these platonic forms are Whitehead calls them eternal objects he says that they're deficient
in actuality and he doesn't want to grant these forms any causal power all the causal power
in Whitehead's universe comes from actual occasions which are the agents and so that means we can't
say that the ideal is the judge the ideal is a lure that the agencies are lured by
and so decisions are made by agents right the ideal isn't where the judgment is coming from
but when we when we start to really have this scale-free conception of agency and of mind
you know we begin to be able to look at physical processes like gravity or entropy and say oh
okay this is a very minimal form of of purpose and if you don't use purpose it has direction
and all you need is this little bit of directionality at that level and then you can begin to evolve
higher forms of purpose which have a larger cognitive like home right but this is a very
different picture of of the universe from what science where science started and I almost think
science needed to bracket purpose and agency in mind from its picture of nature for a few
hundred years to go as far as it could with that sort of a picture yeah but it's right it ran up
against walls in the early 20th century and we're still trying to figure out how to revise and
reimagine science I mean scientists have gone about doing wonderful work even without it's really
the metaphysics and the cosmology underlying science that needs to change because mechanistic
cosmology is is deism basically and we need a more I would say more organic cosmology to
understand how mind has been part of this process from the get-go and there's this kind of evolutionary
continuum to human types of minds but one more thing I want to say to pick up on what you were
saying Michael about epiphenomenalism and you know when it comes to consciousness studies and
philosophy of mind and neuroscience and how we approach this challenge of the place of consciousness
in in in nature epiphenomenalism seems to me to be a non-starter because if we do want an
evolutionary explanation we need to understand consciousness as something that has a causal
role to play in the behavior of organisms because if there is no behavioral implication of this
thing called consciousness then there's no way for it to be selected for evolutionarily speaking
and we we shouldn't be conscious in other words right if it's just epiphenomenal even if that is
a total illusion it only seems like we're conscious and really it's just the playing out of biochemical
forces as many philosophers have pointed out who are usually like panpsychists the seeming is
precisely what we mean by consciousness and so if you can't explain the seeming then you're ignoring
part of the evidence that's there to be explained and so most science has been
for good reason the study of behavior observable measurable measurable behaviors kind of third
person perspective on things as if we were outside the system when you start to study
consciousness you're putting yourself back inside the system you have to take this first person
point of view and from the inside out thinking feeling willing these sorts of concepts become
really important that's the lingua franca of the interior domain which is what we're pointing to
with words like consciousness as vague as they might seem initially and so what is the place of
thinking and feeling and willing in nature we see behavior some of this behavior has clear
can be understood as a goal seeking type of behavior and that has that can be empirically
demonstrated like you know in the ways that you're doing it michael but this doesn't mean
we can't also ask the question from the other point of view the first person point of view
about thinking feeling and willing i think they always go together i don't mean to make sharp
categories between distinctions between these things but when we talk about thinking though
we're more than just and this was an email exchange karen and i had we're more than just
human beings any any any organism but especially human beings were more than just perceiving beings
you know and because there would be a kind of in the philosophical sense and this empiricist
point of view that says that all of our concepts and our ideas and our thinking is really just
faded sense impressions so we all we really do is perceive the world and then we we have these
abstract ideas which are just faded perceptions that we remember and they we generalize these
perceptions so that they start to seem something like a concept but if that's the case if and this
is what like david hume would argue right if that's the case if we really only have that kind of
access to the world around us then our experience is very subjective and i start to wonder if
natural science could be possible if we can really take scientific law and scientific
rationality seriously as anything more than just a nice story that we tell ourselves that
sometimes has practical payoff and maybe you're maybe some of those are happy with that as what
science is but i would want there to be more theoretical heft to scientific explanation and
i think to get there you need to take thinking seriously that in other words we have concepts
we're not just perceiving beings but conceiving beings and what a concept is or an idea is is
exactly the same thing that that we mean when we talk about an ideal or about these forms that
cellular communities are are moving towards when we think we're participating in this realm of forms
and these are universal we all share the same set of forms right and so what agency and experience
would be then is the sort of confluence between what we perceive which is always in terms of
particular perceptions the confluence of these particular perceptions with these universal
concepts and they meet and mingle uh and synthesize in the context of our experience
but it's only if we have access to these types of universals that we can really do science that we
can talk about law uh then we can make explanations which would not just be useful explanations
that's important too and it's a criterion for what successful science is that this has
instrumental operationalizable payoff but that these are also true right and so i resist the idea
like you know the kind of work that donal hoffman is doing is really interesting and i think on some
level um it's accurate but i won't i can't go all the way with them because it again undermines the
epistemological presuppositions of science itself if we put ourselves in that kind of a simulation
right so yeah wanted to touch on all those things and see what see what lands yeah yeah very very
interesting um well a couple i want to say a couple things and one one is uh that uh this
distinction you know first person third person i i also think that and i haven't seen a lot on this
i don't know if somebody's already looked and looked at this before but um i think i think
actually there should be a lot of emphasis on second person which is that i think a lot of
this is actually driven by attempts to get some biology hacking each other right so every cell
is some other cells external environment every cell is trying to behave your shape its neighbors and
you know trying to tell the trying to get get your neighbor whether that be a commensal a parasite
doing something to the host uh multi cells in a multicellular organism creatures in a group
whatever at every scale uh there's a lot of stuff going on at second in second person which
means you're trying to get somebody to do something and then trying to get them to do something and
trying to be efficient so you don't uh dispel all your energy and die you need to have a decent model
of what are they what what is the what is the most complicated thing they're capable of doing for the
with the least amount of prompting for me so it's very an engineering i see all of biology as a
fundamentally having a very engineering perspective so when i look at something i ask how much
competency can i squeeze out of this thing so that it will do what i wanted to do without me
there to micromanage all of it like well how far can i go right and and that then once you're good
at those kind of things you can turn that back on yourself and you can tell a nice first person
story well hey i'm a complex then i can do interesting things and right and so so i think a
lot of this stems from this kind of second person necessity of of life and then we can go back and
apply that same lens to you know what you were talking about uh from physics all the way up like
you know oftentimes people people have asked me um you know in my framework is there a zero
on the on the spectrum right like is there any non-agential events in the universe and you know
i think all the way back to like uh just action principle yeah yeah yeah yeah right i like it like
a dumb rock roll you know they always say well how about a rock rolling down the hill you know you
don't want to say that's well it's not much but it isn't zero because if i'm an engineer
and i'm building a roller coaster i have to work pretty hard to get the thing up the up to the top
but but what i don't have to spend any time worrying about is getting it to the bottom
so i've just saved myself some effort as an engineer by having a frame where this thing has
some confidence now it isn't much it isn't you know the human level but of course it wouldn't
be because we're looking for the minimum right so so with these least action kind of things
even particles do this kind of stuff and there and then so then then you might think that it's
there's a non-zero minimum um and then what the things we call life are the things that are good
at scaling that up right so if you just put a pile of them into a rock you haven't really scaled
anything it's exactly the same as what you started with just bigger but if uh but if but but what life
does is actually scale them up into this hierarchical architecture where uh they can now do more in
other problem spaces and whatnot and we call that when things are good at that that's what we call
living that's kind of my definition of of of life and so um yeah you know this kind of second
person attempt to control things in past messages is uh that that that engineering approach on all
of this is you know it's kind of what i what i see everywhere um yeah i think i i heard chris fields
in one of your recent conversations with him say something like that physics is really you can
understand it in terms of the kind of communications theory yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely and and so
so i mean he's the expert on this certainly not me but um i think that this is different from the
typical i mean the thing people typically don't like about panpsychist views is that they see it as
painting extra glow onto perfectly good physics right so you've got a perfectly good physics that
does everything you want it to do and then we say oh and by the way also there's this other dongle
that the guy hangs on to that this this conscious thing so people don't like that but but that's
actually you know people like chris and carlferson and various others that isn't what they're doing
they're trying to actually redefine physics in a more useful way where the primary thing is the
thing that we're talking about here right the agential stuff is and so that's a completely
different thing and that's and and and the judge there is going to be uh empirical utility it's not
this this kind of uh you know epiphenomenal glow that you paint onto stuff it actually has to work
and i mean i think i think it's done um you know i think i think lots of interesting things have
come of it i've asked chris once uh is it possible could could we design a universe that really had
a zero you know uh that that had no least action and all that and he said it you the only universe
you can do that in is one where nothing ever happens so a completely static universe that
then then you could say it's zero but as soon as you have things interacting uh at least in
ways that we understand you know and then then that's it you're you're you're not zero anymore and
you know with respect to like the hoffman stuff i mean i don't know i uh i think that part part of
it is that and people sometimes also ask like is it possible that we're living in a simulation
or something like i'm like i i don't see any other alternative because we are we are very
limited uh very specific types of cognitive systems we are good with you know medium-sized
objects moving at medium speeds through three-dimensional space we see a tiny slit of
of the electromagnetic spectrum of the auditory whatever we we don't seem you know we don't feel
other things at all um so it's kind of inevitable that we're going to have some sort of perspective
on these things that to what extent you know i i agree with you that i think it is picking out
real things in the world but i think that um almost by you know i don't see any way around
the this idea that what we're picking out is the low hanging fruit for the kind of cognitive
system that we have and then you know uh and then if there was another you know that's that
that comes up a lot in ai where people say they want human understandable models they
they don't like um ai's that make good predictions but we can't figure out why it is
and i mean i get it we it's nice to have human understandable models but
i don't see any reason to expect that the vast bulk of the things that we want to understand
are going to be human understandable right i'm just not sure like just because we are a particular
kind of like like who said you know if somebody said here's a you know here's a here's a planet of um
uh you know uh chimps and uh and and you know and you would say yeah there's a whole bunch of
stuff they're just not going to get i'm not sure that we're you know i'm not sure we're past some
sort of critical mass where okay now we can really just understand everything i think it's
entirely possible that we are a particular lens and that lens is good enough as don points out
and then there are other kinds of cognitive systems out there maybe maybe ai's will do it
maybe there's some aliens out there or something but but but other possible minds that are going
to do a very different job of carving up the world you know
if again if we were just perceptual beings i think everything that hafman is saying would be
absolutely true and i'm not trying to create a dualism here but it seems to me that our thinking
activity um when we're doing science when we're reasoning about the world in any way
allows us to connect up perceps in meaningful and and intelligible ways so a concept is really a
it's a connection between perceps um once
my robot vacuum just decided to turn on so i'm gonna close the door um i'm gonna tell us something
i know it's like hey i'm an agent over here um lightning strikes that's cool uh a concept is
a connection between perceps right and so without this activity that's able to and it's
because we're not just remembering how perceps have related to each other in the past because
we're also capable of novelty we're capable of adapting to new situations and so there's some
other poll here to the process of agency that's not just about perception and but but that
perceptual poll is definitely highly contingent on the type of sensory organs we have and on the type
of um common sense way of amalgamating those different perceptual streams into a picture of
a three-dimensional world of of moving bodies and we get habituated to that that world and that
that common sense way of perceiving things but i all i would say is that because we have this
conceptual thinking capacity um there's no there's no limit sort of a priori limit to
the knowledge that we can gain of the world around us right um we're we're limited as a
matter of fact but in principle we can always overcome any limit um that seems to be in place
whether we can get to the final truth of the nature or everything i i don't know but it seems to me
that there's a pathway forward we have good reason to believe that by engaging in this process of
thinking we can discover new things about the perceptual world that are not just there in the
past as memory and habit that we've accumulated right and i don't want to get all spooky and
mystical but you you know karen you brought up jordan peterson he will often reference the logos
the idea of this ordering principle in the cosmos and whatever morpho spaces i think it has something
to do with this ordering principle and many traditions have referred to it as the logos
and our thinking activity i think is in some way is a participation in that ordering principle
finite participation in an ordering principle that's far vaster and more
uh magical and mysterious than humans have yet even scratched the surface of but nonetheless
i think there is this deeper intelligibility in the nature of things which if it if it weren't
real science would not be possible right well the way to keep the the ordering principle for
being spooky is to just think about it the way he thinks about it which is at the at the border
between order and chaos is this capacity to either move into chaos voluntarily or fall into
chaos accidentally and in the chaos there are all kinds of answers because all the answers lie in
the unknown all the new information lies in the unknown and that that's the ordering principle
gathering what's necessary from the unknown to bring it back into the known so that the order
becomes new again and does not remain static but still has that dynamic quality that keeps it
fresh that that's the ordering principle and i don't think that's spooky at all because that
also scales all the way down when you can see that everywhere yeah yeah and i think that the
challenge here is to avoid falling prey to what dan danett was so critical of this idea of skyhooks
and you know i think this is why we need to zero in on agency
and recognize that whatever agency is it's operating at all scales it grows more
capable as it evolves because it learns how to dip further into this space of possibilities
and it knows how to do so not just as a matter of you know ingressing novelty but as a matter of
ingressing relevant novelty like agents can human beings can dip into this set of unrealized
possibilities in a way that is not just chaotic but relevant to the past and that the real evolutionary
challenge challenge for agents is is the ingression of relevant novelty because there's infinite
possibilities and we need to know as agents in any given moment of our experience which of
those possibilities have relevance to our actual situation and that's a that's a problem that i
think an evolutionary understanding and a an understanding of evolution as a pedagogical
process of of gradually learning about you know like what john revakey would call relevance
realization and ratcheting up this capacity and it's a collective effort and i like michael your
emphasis on second person i think that's right i think that's where all the action is and we can
talk about these two poles of the first and the third person but it's the it's that relationship
the relationality the communication um or all the action is and so this is why agency is never
just something that an individual does agency and intelligence even are always collective
efforts and i think for but for cells to engage in this collective effort there needs to be something
that they all share right some kind of ordering principle that they're all capable of participating
in and that's the mystery i feel like that's what we're bumping up against here um and what we need
new concepts to get a handle on and in a way that doesn't certainly doesn't revert to the sort of
essentialist teleology that scholastics pre-evolutionary thinkers we're talking about
but we need to we need to revisit some of those ideas a platonic realism
and again you know reimagine it in an evolutionary context because we can't move forward without
some understanding of ideals forms right i'd like to ask michael here when you were using this this
term um ingression of relevant novelty it made me think about something i heard michael just say
this morning um you were saying michael that this was in a video that you did with carlos
farias i think you called it uh poly computing and you were saying that with the right prompting
meaning the right chemical signals from the parasite the oak tree leaf will produce these
beautiful galls so but when i was thinking about that i'm thinking does that prompting
presuppose that the subroutine that creates that gall is already present in the leaf and
it just needed to be prompted by the chemical signal yes or what does that mean right what does
it mean that that's a that's a that's a tricky question it because and i think you know i'm
pretty sure the ancients were all over this in the sense that when you dump a bunch of marbles
onto this thing and you get this nice bell curve or you get a distribution of prime numbers
does that mean that was already there and all you did is somehow pull it out by virtue of creating
the right machine or or or not right i i think it i i think it's exactly the same question um
in the prompt is the physical machine uh that that you're using to get this effect and the pattern
is the thing that you're going to get i mean i don't know i i don't know of you know people
argue about whether mathematics is discovered or invented and stuff like that but there are so
many cases where uh there is this uh this this this deep um pattern that emerges and you know i'm
not sure it's it's helpful to argue philosophically about whether it was there or not but i do think
so so here's how i've taken this approach is is i you know i don't really want to argue whether
this this thing was there before or not but as an engineer what i'd like is to have a frame that
helps me engineer so a frame that helps me engineer if if a frame like that is well you got to track
all the microstates of everything and and the only things that are there are things that were
were selected for by evolution like those kind of frames are are provably deficient they do not do
a great job and so uh that means we can have a different frame which says okay there's a there's
a space of possible outcomes evolution produces machines for exploring that space and we can hijack
some of that same machinery now faster and better with with ai and with other tools to
pull out the contents of that space and in fact to help me engineer i'm even going to make a map
of that space i don't want to have philosophical debates about whether that space is real all i
know is if i had a map of that space and i knew which things were next to each other things and
therefore which are my prompts i could i could leverage with the least amount of effort to pull
out new things i would do better than somebody who doesn't believe in the space who doesn't think it
exists you know all that that kind of stuff so that that's you know that's the approach i take on
this which maybe you know me i've had i've had people call it them you know philosophically
unsophisticated and and fine maybe it is uh but but but in the end what i want is i want us to be
able to distinguish between competing worldviews and to me the thing that produces more more unified
understanding more compact descriptions of of reality that help us better relate to
things around us the various different agency things in our environment better prediction
and control more invention more discovery more new capabilities that that's the worldview
i i'm looking for that's that's the lens whatever lens gets me to that and and i think then this
question of whether it was there before i don't know but i do know that there's a whole
space of of possibilities and i'd like a map of that space as an engineer i want a map of that
space well yeah i mean it it's like the possibility space right i know mathematicians who
say that they can actually walk around in that possibility space mathematics they
they can visualize the entire thing inside their heads yeah and that made me think about
the salamander when it loses a limb it can regrow a new limb is that is that some sort
of memory capacity well well we know i mean in planaria we know it's a memory capacity
a because uh we can see it we can see the memories and we can rewrite to these memories
and also just for fun and this is unpublished so take this with a grain of salt but uh
preliminary data say that when you put classic memory blockers you know things that block
learning and recall and rats and humans and so on you can make planaria forget how to be a
planarian they literally go back and okay mic drop i mean yeah again i'm not peer reviewed
right like early preliminary data whatever you know take it take it with a grain of salt
but but but the fact is aside from any of that for all all the work that we've done
a lot of it is borrowing concepts from cognitive neuroscience and applying them
fruitfully to discover new things in areas where people normally don't think it belongs
right so we will take things uh um uh perceptual bystability and i mean of course active inference
and and memory and visual illusions and expectation i mean this old table and a couple
of my papers i get this long table of you take all these things and all of them are usable
in developmental biology and in other other fields because the techniques can't tell the
difference and therefore i that's why you know we kind of started out this way talking about
fields and silos come come back to that uh i think they're artificial we we make these
differences and we make departments of this and departments of that and and and to the point
where things i say in one department everybody's like yeah no kidding we of course that's obvious
in another department they throw tomatoes because because it sounds ridiculous right and and we
have different journals and we have different funding bodies and whatever but the techniques
can't tell the difference and so that tells me that this is artificial in a in a large sense
there there needs to be yeah and and and that also goes back to the strategy again i don't
you know philosophic i don't know if this is naive or not but somebody said to me once uh
you know you get into this you get into so much trouble calling these things memory
why have all these arguments just call it come up with a different name just come up with a
different name and then and then people don't need to fight about it and all i could think of was
well newton could have said well let's see there's gravity for the moon and then there's
shmavity for the for the apple falling down to the earth good we now we got two names and we
have to fight about it but but he would have missed out on like the core insight that it's the same
thing right and so so no i don't want to come up with a new name because because i think the name
of the game is unification i think as much as possible we should be looking for symmetries
for invariance and not proliferating uh names for these things and yeah um this is exactly why
whitehead as a metaphysician uh wants to say that energetic transmission is uh a kind of vector
feeling and so that there are he i mean his technical term is prehension that that prehensive
relationships which would be his way of talking about causal transmission uh has a
it's it's the it's the transmission of feelings right and so uh some people would hear that and
think it's actually it's absolutely kooky but on the other hand it's a search for unification so
that we don't have to say that the very complex intense forms of feeling that animals and human
beings uh experience somehow arises through some other mysterious process that it seems
very difficult to ever understand none of this was there from the beginning and we just need to
we're not adding something new to physics we're understanding what physics itself is already
describing um as in some sense continuous with what psychology would be describing yeah yeah right
so i think it was i don't i don't know if it was chris fields or who it was but maybe it was chris
who said you know the project is the sentience of physics and the physics of sentience absolutely
and i think that seems that seems to get out all of it like you you made a comment in one of
your other videos that for you there's a very interesting distinction between control and
relationship could you comment on that just briefly as it might connect with what he was just saying
yeah um you know so so figure one in my my first paper on tame this uh technological approach to
mind everywhere framework figure one is this thing that uh is kind of like this it's like i call it
the spectrum of persuadability so it's this idea that in order to put this this all goes back to
even the the the whole um like cognitive light cone thing came about in uh 2018 when i was at a
templeton conference and pranab das asked us to come up with a framework in which diverse
intelligences could all be compared together you know and so people were thinking um you know
primates and elephants and and and you know uh crows and maybe octopus and things like this and
you know and so we were we were thinking about this and i'm thinking okay let's what if we
crank up the knobs to 11 you know on all of this and say it sells ai you know software ai's aliens
synthetic beings like all of it what's the and so and so i started thinking about what what do all
agents regardless of their composition regardless of their provenance how they you know designed
engineered whatever what do they all have in common and so so i came up with this with this
kind of focus which again not super new i mean we wiener and rosin bluth had it in 1943 this this
idea that that everything's about um levels of levels of controllability and so and so i got
the spectrum of persuadability which is basically uh you know you got at least it's just some way
points right so you got your mechanical clock which you're not going to convince of anything
you're not going to reward and punish you you just have to physically rewire it and then you
get your thermostat and that's better because you have a set point and you don't have to even know
how the rest of the thing works as long as you know how to how to rewire the set point and then
you've got some some animals which can and and some other agents which can learn from experience
and there you really don't need to know much except the currency of behaviorist uh
um kinds of protocols because they offer this amazing interface to you this learning interface
where you know humans for thousands of years train dogs and horses without knowing any neuroscience
at all um and then and then you got humans and whatever else past that and so and so one way
to think about this as an engineer is control so what i want is i want to be at the right place on
this uh diagram for any given system somebody gives me something i don't want to undershoot
with agency i don't want to be um you know treating uh the human brain as a as a as a
paperweight and and kind of not understand what i've what i've got and i don't want to overshoot
i don't want to look at that i don't want to be yelling at this um uh mechanical clock and
trying to make it feel guilty i want to be i want to be at the at the right level for whatever the
system is um so so an engineer sees that and he sees efficient prediction and control but
but i see this much more broadly which is what you're really looking for is a relationship with
the system and at lower ends at the lower ends of that spectrum it really does just to kind of
smoothly blend into its engineering approach but ultimately sort of at the at the higher ends
and so we're talking with other humans with uh possible you know cyborgs in the future maybe
with ai's maybe with aliens who don't look anything like us what you're looking for are
ways to relate to that system to ask how much agency is there that i can um relate to and
specifically i found um something uh and i apologize in about one minute i'm gonna have to
run um somebody i recently found something that that they they came out they came they're trying
to come up with this thing to distinguish human products from things that ai makes right because
some people think that's a very profound difference and so they want to know so they call it proof of
humanity that you know you get you get these like um uh cryptographic certificates or something
that says it's you know proof of humanity and and as i think about it you know if i want proof of
humanity for whoever i'm having a relationship with what do i really what am i really after am
i really after knowing what your dna is nah i don't care about your dna am i really after
knowing what your anatomy is and then i'm going to find out that you know 80 percent of you has
been replaced by artificial organs i don't care what what what do we care about when we're talking
proof of humanity and i think what we care what we're talking about is a uh is is a level of of
compassion a a minimally human standard human level of ability to care about certain things and
having similar existential um uh you know struggles and and and stuff like that so so it's not just
about the engineering and control like we have in regenerative medicine it i think it shades
into the kinds of things we do with other with other humans and societies and so on i love that
we're ending here with ethics because there's so many ethical implications here um with your
research and this point of view because if we're dealing with agencies all the way down
obviously there's no way to never um inhibit or want to control the agency of some beings like
we have to eat life is robbery as whitehead says but he adds the the robber needs justification
and that's where ethics and morals come in and for whitehead the whole process of evolution is this
this movement from force to persuasion is the dominant mode of relationship and that's what
human beings are struggling with right now all right so i know we both have to go but i think
that's a great place to to end um so much more to talk about but this was so much fun absolutely
yeah thank you so much yeah great great to meet you Matthew thank you Karen this was a lot of fun
yeah yeah a lot of fun bye bye thanks all right bye bye
