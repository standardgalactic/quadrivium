00:00.000 --> 00:11.300
On What There Is by Willard Van Orman Quine, published in 1948.

00:11.300 --> 00:17.600
A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity.

00:17.600 --> 00:24.040
It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.

00:24.040 --> 00:27.400
What is there?

00:27.400 --> 00:33.760
It can be answered, moreover, in a word—everything.

00:33.760 --> 00:38.200
And everyone will accept this answer as true.

00:38.200 --> 00:44.960
However, this is merely to say that there is what there is.

00:44.960 --> 00:51.400
There remains room for disagreement over cases, and so the issue has stayed alive down the

00:51.400 --> 00:54.200
centuries.

00:54.200 --> 01:02.400
Suppose now that two philosophers, MacX and I, differ over ontology.

01:02.400 --> 01:10.200
Suppose MacX maintains there is something which I maintain there is not.

01:10.200 --> 01:17.120
MacX can, quite consistently with his own point of view, describe our difference of opinion

01:17.120 --> 01:22.320
by saying that I refuse to recognize certain entities.

01:22.320 --> 01:28.160
I should protest, of course, that he is wrong in his formulation of our disagreement, for

01:28.160 --> 01:36.080
I maintain that there are no entities of the kind which he alleges, for me to recognize.

01:36.080 --> 01:42.560
But my finding him wrong in his formulation of our disagreement is unimportant, for I

01:42.560 --> 01:48.400
am committed to considering him wrong in his ontology anyway.

01:48.400 --> 01:54.440
When I try to formulate our difference of opinion, on the other hand, I seem to be in

01:54.440 --> 01:56.360
a predicament.

01:56.360 --> 02:03.400
I cannot admit that there are some things which MacX countenances and I do not, for,

02:03.400 --> 02:08.560
in admitting that there are such things, I should be contradicting my own rejection of

02:08.560 --> 02:10.400
them.

02:10.400 --> 02:17.840
It would appear, if this reasoning were sound, that, in any ontological dispute, the proponent

02:17.840 --> 02:24.440
of the negative side suffers the disadvantage of not being able to admit that his opponent

02:24.440 --> 02:27.000
disagrees with him.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.560
This is the old platonic riddle of non-being.

02:31.560 --> 02:36.480
Non-being must, in some sense, be.

02:36.480 --> 02:41.840
Otherwise, what is it that there is not?

02:41.840 --> 02:46.440
This tangled doctrine might be nicknamed Plato's Beard.

02:46.440 --> 02:54.240
Historically, it is proved tough, frequently dulling the edge of Occam's razor.

02:54.240 --> 03:01.080
It is some such line of thought that leads philosophers like MacX to impute being where

03:01.080 --> 03:06.600
they might otherwise be quite content to recognize that there is nothing.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.440
Thus, take Pegasus.

03:10.440 --> 03:17.600
If Pegasus were not, MacX argues, we should not be talking about anything when we use the

03:17.600 --> 03:18.800
word.

03:18.800 --> 03:26.480
Therefore, it would be nonsense to say even that Pegasus is not.

03:26.480 --> 03:32.380
Thinking to show thus that the denial of Pegasus cannot be coherently maintained, he concludes

03:32.380 --> 03:35.520
that Pegasus is.

03:35.520 --> 03:44.320
MacX cannot, indeed, quite persuade himself that any region of space-time near or remote

03:44.320 --> 03:48.600
contains a flying horse of flesh and blood.

03:48.600 --> 03:57.120
Pressed for further details on Pegasus, then, he says that Pegasus is an idea in men's minds.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.960
Here, however, a confusion begins to be apparent.

04:01.960 --> 04:08.960
We may, for the sake of argument, concede that there is an entity, and even a unique

04:08.960 --> 04:15.840
entity, though this is rather implausible, which is the mental Pegasus idea.

04:15.840 --> 04:23.920
But this mental entity is not what people are talking about when they deny Pegasus.

04:23.920 --> 04:29.680
MacX confuses the Parthenon with the Parthenon idea.

04:29.680 --> 04:38.600
The Parthenon is physical, the Parthenon idea is mental, according anyway to MacX's version

04:38.600 --> 04:43.000
of ideas, and I have no better to offer.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.280
The Parthenon is visible, the Parthenon idea is invisible.

04:50.280 --> 04:58.560
We cannot easily imagine two things more unlike, and less liable to confusion, than the Parthenon

04:58.560 --> 05:01.560
and the Parthenon idea.

05:01.560 --> 05:08.200
But when we shift from the Parthenon to Pegasus, the confusion sets in.

05:08.200 --> 05:14.720
For no other reason than MacX would sooner be deceived by the crudest and most flagrant

05:14.720 --> 05:20.320
counterfeit than grant the non-being of Pegasus.

05:20.320 --> 05:27.080
The notion that Pegasus must be, because it would otherwise be nonsense to say even that

05:27.080 --> 05:35.640
Pegasus is not, has been seen to lead MacX into an elementary confusion.

05:35.640 --> 05:41.540
Subtler minds, taking the same precept as their starting point, come out with theories

05:41.540 --> 05:49.240
of Pegasus which are less patently misguided than MacX's, and correspondingly more difficult

05:49.240 --> 05:51.840
to eradicate.

05:51.840 --> 05:58.600
One of these subtler minds is named, let us say, Wyman.

05:58.600 --> 06:06.900
Pegasus, Wyman maintains, has his being as an unactualized possible.

06:06.900 --> 06:14.480
When we say of Pegasus that there is no such thing, we are saying more precisely that Pegasus

06:14.480 --> 06:20.000
does not have the special attribute of actuality.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.320
Saying that Pegasus is not actual is on par, logically, with saying that the Parthenon is

06:27.320 --> 06:28.820
not red.

06:28.820 --> 06:37.640
In either case, we are saying something about an entity whose being is unquestioned.

06:37.640 --> 06:44.000
Wyman, by the way, is one of those philosophers who have united in ruining the good old word

06:44.000 --> 06:47.040
exist.

06:47.040 --> 06:56.560
Despite his espousal of unactualized possibilities, he limits the word existence to actuality,

06:56.560 --> 07:03.560
thus preserving an illusion of ontological agreement between himself and us who repudiate

07:03.560 --> 07:07.320
the rest of his bloated universe.

07:07.320 --> 07:12.320
We have all been prone to say, in our common sense usage of exist, that we have all been

07:12.320 --> 07:20.680
prone to say, in our common sense usage of exist, that Pegasus does not exist, meaning

07:20.680 --> 07:26.320
simply that there is no such entity at all.

07:26.320 --> 07:32.680
If Pegasus existed, he would indeed be in space and time.

07:32.680 --> 07:41.960
But only because the word Pegasus has spatiotemporal connotations, and not because exists has

07:41.960 --> 07:46.160
spatiotemporal connotations.

07:46.160 --> 07:52.960
If spatiotemporal reference is lacking when we affirm the existence of the cube root of

07:52.960 --> 08:01.880
twenty-seven, this is simply because a cube root is not a spatiotemporal kind of thing,

08:01.880 --> 08:07.600
and not because we are being ambiguous in our use of exist.

08:08.280 --> 08:16.280
However, Wyman, in an ill-conceived effort to appear agreeable, genially grants us the

08:16.280 --> 08:24.200
non-existence of Pegasus, and then, contrary to what we meant by non-existence of Pegasus,

08:24.200 --> 08:29.440
insists that Pegasus is.

08:29.440 --> 08:35.880
Existence is one thing, he says, and subsistence is another.

08:35.880 --> 08:43.560
The only way I know of coping with this obfuscation of issues is to give Wyman the word exist.

08:43.560 --> 08:48.400
I'll not try to use it again, I still have is.

08:48.400 --> 08:55.160
So much for lexicography, let's go back to Wyman's ontology.

08:55.160 --> 09:02.100
Wyman's overpopulated universe is, in many ways, unlovely.

09:02.100 --> 09:09.340
It offends the aesthetic sense of us who have a taste for desert landscapes, but this is

09:09.340 --> 09:11.980
not the worst of it.

09:11.980 --> 09:18.820
Wyman's slum of possibles is a breeding ground for disorderly elements.

09:18.820 --> 09:25.340
Take, for instance, the possible fat man in that doorway, and again, the possible bald

09:25.340 --> 09:27.780
man in that doorway.

09:27.780 --> 09:33.340
Are they the same possible man, or two possible men?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.140
How do we decide?

09:35.140 --> 09:39.460
How many possible men are there in that doorway?

09:39.460 --> 09:43.300
Are there more possible thin ones than fat ones?

09:43.300 --> 09:45.860
How many of them are alike?

09:45.860 --> 09:50.500
Or would their being alike make them one?

09:50.500 --> 09:53.900
Are no two possible things alike?

09:53.900 --> 10:00.580
Is this the same as saying that it is impossible for two things to be alike?

10:00.580 --> 10:10.860
Or finally, is the concept of identity simply inapplicable to unactualized possibles?

10:10.860 --> 10:17.540
But what sense can be found in talking of entities which cannot meaningfully be said

10:17.540 --> 10:23.620
to be identical with themselves and distinct from one another?

10:23.620 --> 10:28.180
These elements are well nigh incorrigible.

10:28.180 --> 10:35.900
By a Phragian therapy of individual concepts, some effort might be made at rehabilitation,

10:35.900 --> 10:43.740
but I feel we'd do better simply to clear Wyman's slum and be done with it.

10:43.740 --> 10:51.620
Possibility, along with other modalities of necessity and impossibility and contingency,

10:51.620 --> 10:58.020
poses problems upon which I do not mean to imply that we should turn our backs.

10:58.020 --> 11:04.460
But we can at least limit modalities to whole statements.

11:04.460 --> 11:12.580
We may impose the adverb possibly upon a statement as a whole, and we may well worry about the

11:12.580 --> 11:20.620
semantical analysis of such usage, but little real advance in such analysis is to be hoped

11:20.620 --> 11:27.020
for in expanding our universe to include so-called possible entities.

11:27.020 --> 11:34.460
I suspect that the main motive for this expansion is simply the old notion that Pegasus, for

11:34.460 --> 11:42.620
example, must be because otherwise it would be nonsense to say even that he is not.

11:42.620 --> 11:50.180
Still, all the rank luxuriance of Wyman's universe of possibles would seem to come to

11:50.180 --> 11:57.820
not when we make a slight change in the example and speak not of Pegasus, but of the round

11:57.820 --> 12:02.780
square cupula on Berkeley College.

12:02.780 --> 12:10.900
If unless Pegasus were, it would be nonsense to say that he is not, then by the same token,

12:10.900 --> 12:16.700
unless the round square cupula on Berkeley College were, it would be nonsense to say

12:16.700 --> 12:19.740
that it is not.

12:19.740 --> 12:28.340
But unlike Pegasus, the round square cupula on Berkeley College cannot be admitted even

12:28.340 --> 12:32.240
as an unactualized possible.

12:32.240 --> 12:40.100
Can we drive Wyman now to admitting also a realm of unactualizable impossibles?

12:40.100 --> 12:46.200
If so, a good many embarrassing questions could be asked about them.

12:46.200 --> 12:52.100
We might even hope to trap Wyman in contradictions by getting him to admit that certain of these

12:52.100 --> 12:55.980
entities are at once round and square.

12:55.980 --> 13:03.180
But the wily Wyman chooses the other horn of the dilemma and concludes that it is nonsense

13:03.180 --> 13:07.960
to say that the round square cupula on Berkeley College is not.

13:07.960 --> 13:15.120
He says that the phrase round square cupula is meaningless.

13:15.120 --> 13:19.760
Wyman was not the first to embrace this alternative.

13:19.760 --> 13:25.800
The doctrine of the meaninglessness of contradictions runs away back.

13:25.800 --> 13:33.400
The tradition survives, moreover, in writers who seem to share none of Wyman's motivations.

13:34.160 --> 13:41.120
Still, I wonder whether the first temptation to such a doctrine may not have been substantially

13:41.120 --> 13:44.920
the motivation which we have observed in Wyman.

13:44.920 --> 13:53.880
Certainly, the doctrine has no intrinsic appeal, and it has led its devotees to such quixotic

13:53.880 --> 14:00.480
extremes as that of challenging the method of proof by reductio ad absurdum, a challenge

14:00.560 --> 14:06.000
in which I sense a reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine itself.

14:06.000 --> 14:13.500
Moreover, the doctrine of meaninglessness of contradictions has the severe methodological

14:13.500 --> 14:21.000
drawback that it makes it impossible, in principle, ever to devise an effective test of what is

14:21.000 --> 14:24.600
meaningful and what is not.

14:24.600 --> 14:31.560
It would be forever impossible for us to devise systematic ways of deciding whether a string

14:31.560 --> 14:39.840
of signs made sense, even to us individually, let alone other people, or not.

14:39.840 --> 14:46.080
For it follows from a discovery in mathematical logic, due to church, that there can be no

14:46.080 --> 14:51.280
generally applicable test of contradictoryness.

14:51.280 --> 14:58.040
I have spoken disparagingly of Plato's beard, and hinted that it is tangled.

14:58.040 --> 15:02.720
I have dwelt at length on the inconveniences of putting up with it.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.560
It is time to think about taking steps.

15:06.560 --> 15:13.480
Russell, in his theory of so-called singular descriptions, showed clearly how we might

15:13.480 --> 15:21.280
meaningfully use seeming names without supposing that there be entities allegedly named.

15:21.280 --> 15:27.560
The names to which Russell's theory directly applies are complex, descriptive names, such

15:27.560 --> 15:35.000
as the author of Waverly, the present king of France, the round square cupula on Berkeley

15:35.000 --> 15:37.200
College.

15:37.200 --> 15:44.560
Russell analyses such phrases systematically as fragments of the whole sentences in which

15:44.560 --> 15:46.640
they occur.

15:46.640 --> 15:55.200
The sentence, the author of Waverly was a poet, for example, is explained as a whole as meaning

15:55.200 --> 16:05.320
someone, better, something, wrote Waverly, and was a poet, and nothing else wrote Waverly.

16:05.320 --> 16:10.400
The point of this added clause is to affirm the uniqueness, which is implicit in the word

16:10.400 --> 16:15.080
the, in the author of Waverly.

16:15.080 --> 16:22.440
The sentence, the round square cupula on Berkeley College is pink, is explained as something

16:22.440 --> 16:30.320
is round and square, and is a cupula on Berkeley College, and is pink, and nothing else is round

16:30.320 --> 16:35.400
and square and a cupula on Berkeley College.

16:35.400 --> 16:43.720
The virtue of this analysis is that the seeming name, a descriptive phrase, is paraphrased

16:43.720 --> 16:49.240
in context as a so-called incomplete symbol.

16:49.240 --> 16:55.920
No unified expression is offered as an analysis of the descriptive phrase, but the statement

16:55.920 --> 17:02.480
as a whole, which was the context of that phrase, still gets its full quota of meaning,

17:02.480 --> 17:05.800
whether true or false.

17:05.800 --> 17:12.680
The unanalyzed statement, the author of Waverly was a poet, contains a part, the author of

17:12.680 --> 17:20.240
Waverly, which is wrongly supposed by McEx and Wyman, to demand objective reference

17:20.240 --> 17:23.320
in order to be meaningful at all.

17:23.320 --> 17:30.040
But in Russell's translation, something wrote Waverly and was a poet, and nothing else

17:30.040 --> 17:37.520
wrote Waverly, the burden of objective reference, which had been put upon the descriptive phrase,

17:37.520 --> 17:45.160
is now taken over by words of the kind that logicians call bound variables, variables

17:45.160 --> 17:53.680
of quantification, namely words like something, nothing, everything.

17:53.680 --> 17:59.600
These words, far from purporting to be names specifically of the author of Waverly, do

17:59.600 --> 18:03.280
not purport to be names at all.

18:03.280 --> 18:12.560
They refer to entities generally, with a kind of studied ambiguity peculiar to themselves.

18:12.560 --> 18:20.920
These quantificational words or bound variables are, of course, a basic part of language,

18:20.920 --> 18:27.480
and their meaningfulness, at least in context, is not to be challenged.

18:27.480 --> 18:34.880
But their meaningfulness in no way presupposes there being either the author of Waverly or

18:34.880 --> 18:43.080
the round square cupula on Berkeley College or any other specifically pre-assigned objects.

18:43.080 --> 18:50.280
Where descriptions are concerned, there is no longer any difficulty in affirming or denying

18:50.280 --> 18:51.960
being.

18:51.960 --> 18:59.600
There is the author of Waverly, is explained by Russell as meaning someone, or more strictly

18:59.600 --> 19:05.760
something, wrote Waverly and nothing else wrote Waverly.

19:05.760 --> 19:13.880
The author of Waverly is not, is explained correspondingly as the alternation, either

19:13.880 --> 19:21.080
each thing failed to write Waverly or two or more things wrote Waverly.

19:21.080 --> 19:27.760
This alternation is false, but meaningful, and it contains no expression purporting to

19:27.760 --> 19:31.040
name the author of Waverly.

19:31.040 --> 19:40.240
The statement the round square cupula on Berkeley College is not, is analyzed in similar fashion.

19:40.240 --> 19:47.640
So the old notion that statements of non-being defeat themselves goes by the board.

19:47.640 --> 19:54.280
When a statement of being or non-being is analyzed by Russell's theory of descriptions,

19:54.280 --> 20:00.680
it ceases to contain any expression which even purports to name the alleged entity whose

20:00.680 --> 20:07.200
being is in question, so that the meaningfulness of the statement no longer can be thought

20:07.200 --> 20:12.360
to presuppose that there be such an entity.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.280
Now what of Pegasus?

20:15.280 --> 20:21.080
This being a word rather than a descriptive phrase, Russell's argument does not immediately

20:21.080 --> 20:22.960
apply to it.

20:22.960 --> 20:27.720
However, it can easily be made to apply.

20:27.720 --> 20:35.120
We have only to rephrase Pegasus as a description in any way that seems adequately to single

20:35.120 --> 20:43.120
out our idea, say, the winged horse that was captured by Balerophon.

20:43.120 --> 20:49.600
Substituting such a phrase for Pegasus, we can then proceed to analyze the statement

20:49.600 --> 20:57.600
Pegasus is or Pegasus is not, precisely on the analogy of Russell's analysis of the

20:57.600 --> 21:04.040
author of Waverly is and the author of Waverly is not.

21:04.040 --> 21:10.680
In order thus to subsume a one-word name or a legend name such as Pegasus under Russell's

21:10.680 --> 21:18.080
theory of description, we must, of course, be able first to translate the word into a

21:18.080 --> 21:19.720
description.

21:19.720 --> 21:23.040
But this is no real restriction.

21:23.040 --> 21:30.800
If the notion of Pegasus had been so obscure or so basic a one that no pat translation

21:30.800 --> 21:36.560
into a descriptive phrase had offered itself along familiar lines, we could still have

21:36.560 --> 21:42.520
availed ourselves of the following artificial and trivial seeming device.

21:42.520 --> 21:51.040
We could have appealed to the ex-hypothesis unanalyzable, irreducible attribute of being

21:51.040 --> 21:59.600
Pegasus, adopting for its expression the verb is Pegasus or Pegasizes.

21:59.600 --> 22:07.040
The noun Pegasus itself could then be treated as derivative and identified, after all, with

22:07.040 --> 22:15.160
a description, the thing that is Pegasus, the thing that Pegasizes.

22:15.160 --> 22:22.400
If the importing of such a predicate as Pegasizes seems to commit us to recognizing that there

22:22.400 --> 22:29.560
is a corresponding attribute Pegasizing in Plato's heaven or in the minds of men, well

22:29.560 --> 22:39.380
and good, neither we nor Wyman nor MacX could have been contending thus far about the being

22:39.380 --> 22:45.840
or non-being of universals, but rather about that of Pegasus.

22:45.840 --> 22:52.880
If in terms of Pegasizing we can interpret the noun Pegasus as a description, subject

22:52.880 --> 23:00.440
to Russell's theory of descriptions, then we have disposed of the old notion that Pegasus

23:00.440 --> 23:09.520
cannot be said not to be without presupposing that in some sense Pegasus is.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.560
Our argument is now quite general.

23:12.560 --> 23:19.040
MacX and Wyman supposed that we could not meaningfully affirm a statement of the form

23:19.040 --> 23:27.040
so-and-so is not, with a simple or descriptive singular noun in place of so-and-so unless

23:27.040 --> 23:30.040
so-and-so is.

23:30.040 --> 23:38.440
This supposition is now seen to be quite generally groundless, since the singular noun in question

23:38.440 --> 23:46.480
can always be expanded into a singular description, trivially or otherwise, and then analyzed out

23:46.480 --> 23:49.640
of Russell.

23:49.640 --> 23:55.580
We commit ourselves to an ontology-containing numbers when we say there are prime numbers

23:55.580 --> 23:57.600
larger than a million.

23:57.600 --> 24:04.000
We commit ourselves to an ontology-containing centars when we say there are centars.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.840
And we commit ourselves to an ontology-containing Pegasus when we say Pegasus is.

24:10.840 --> 24:19.480
But we do not commit ourselves to an ontology-containing Pegasus or the author of Waverly or the round

24:19.480 --> 24:25.640
square cupula on Berkeley College when we say that Pegasus or the author of Waverly

24:25.640 --> 24:30.160
or the cupula in question is not.

24:30.160 --> 24:36.240
We need no longer labor under the delusion that the meaningfulness of a statement containing

24:36.240 --> 24:42.440
a singular term presupposes an entity named by the term.

24:42.440 --> 24:49.800
A singular term need not name to be significant.

24:49.800 --> 24:56.800
An inkling of this might have dawned on Wyman and McEx even without benefit of Russell if

24:56.800 --> 25:06.600
they had only noticed, as so few of us do, that there is a gulf between meaning and naming.

25:06.600 --> 25:13.360
Even in the case of a singular term, which is genuinely a name of an object, the following

25:13.360 --> 25:17.040
example from Frege will serve.

25:17.040 --> 25:25.360
The phrase evening star names a certain large physical object of spherical form which is

25:25.360 --> 25:31.280
hurtling through space some scores of millions of miles from here.

25:31.280 --> 25:38.760
The phrase morning star names the same thing, as was probably first established by some

25:38.760 --> 25:46.880
observant Babylonian, but the two phrases cannot be regarded as having the same meaning.

25:46.880 --> 25:53.560
Otherwise, that Babylonian could have dispensed with his observations and contented himself

25:53.600 --> 25:57.800
with reflecting on the meanings of his words.

25:57.800 --> 26:05.440
The meanings then, being different from one another, must be other than the named object,

26:05.440 --> 26:11.160
which is one and the same in both cases.

26:11.160 --> 26:17.960
Confusion of meaning with naming not only made McEx think he could not meaningfully repudiate

26:17.960 --> 26:24.240
Pegasus, a continuing confusion of meaning with naming no doubt helped and gender his

26:24.240 --> 26:30.240
absurd notion that Pegasus is an idea, a mental entity.

26:30.240 --> 26:34.400
The structure of his confusion is as follows.

26:34.400 --> 26:43.160
He confused the alleged named object Pegasus with the meaning of the word Pegasus, therefore

26:43.200 --> 26:50.160
concluding that Pegasus must be in order that the word have meaning.

26:50.160 --> 26:54.040
But what sorts of things are meanings?

26:54.040 --> 27:00.440
This is a moot point, however, one might quite plausibly explain meanings as ideas in the

27:00.440 --> 27:08.040
mind, supposing we can make clear sense in turn of the idea of ideas in the mind.

27:08.040 --> 27:16.880
Or Pegasus, initially confused with a meaning, ends up as an idea in the mind.

27:16.880 --> 27:23.960
It is the more remarkable that Wyman, subject to the same initial motivation as McEx, should

27:23.960 --> 27:31.960
have avoided this particular blunder and wound up with unactualized possibles instead.

27:31.960 --> 27:37.600
Now let us return to the ontological problem of universals.

27:37.600 --> 27:45.160
The question whether there are such entities as attributes, relations, classes, numbers,

27:45.160 --> 27:53.160
functions, McEx, characteristically enough, thinks there are.

27:53.160 --> 28:00.720
Speaking of attributes, he says, there are red houses, red roses, red sunsets.

28:00.720 --> 28:06.880
This much is pre-philosophical common sense in which we must all agree.

28:06.880 --> 28:14.000
These houses, roses, and sunsets, then, have something in common, and this, which they

28:14.000 --> 28:20.640
have in common, is all I mean by the attribute of redness.

28:20.640 --> 28:27.880
For McEx, thus, their being attributes is even more obvious and trivial than the obvious

28:27.880 --> 28:34.680
and trivial fact of their being red houses, roses, and sunsets.

28:34.680 --> 28:41.720
This, I think, is characteristic of metaphysics, or at least of that part of metaphysics called

28:41.720 --> 28:44.480
ontology.

28:44.480 --> 28:49.920
One who regards a statement on the subject as true at all must regard it as trivially

28:49.920 --> 28:51.960
true.

28:51.960 --> 28:59.480
One's ontology is basic to the conceptual scheme by which he interprets all experiences,

28:59.480 --> 29:03.040
even the most commonplace ones.

29:03.160 --> 29:09.920
Within some particular conceptual scheme, and how else is judgment possible, an ontological

29:09.920 --> 29:18.880
statement goes without saying, standing in need of no separate justification at all.

29:18.880 --> 29:24.720
Ontological statements follow immediately from all manner of causal statements of commonplace

29:24.720 --> 29:31.960
fact, just as, from the point of view anyway of McEx's conceptual scheme, there is an

29:31.960 --> 29:41.440
attribute, follows from, there are red houses, red roses, red sunsets.

29:41.440 --> 29:49.040
Judged in another conceptual scheme, an ontological statement which is axiomatic to McEx's mind

29:49.040 --> 29:56.440
may, with equal immediacy and triviality, be a judged false.

29:56.440 --> 30:03.760
One may admit that there are red houses, roses, and sunsets, but deny, except as a popular

30:03.760 --> 30:10.480
and misleading manner of speaking, that they have anything in common.

30:10.480 --> 30:18.160
The words, houses, roses, and sunsets are true of sundry individual entities which are

30:18.160 --> 30:26.440
houses and roses and sunsets, and the word red, or red object, is true of each of sundry

30:26.440 --> 30:32.040
individual entities which are red houses, red roses, red sunsets.

30:32.040 --> 30:39.560
But there is not, in addition, any entity whatever, individual or otherwise, which is

30:39.560 --> 30:51.400
named by the word redness, nor, for that matter, by the word househood, rosehood, sunsethood.

30:51.400 --> 30:58.760
That the houses and roses and sunsets are all of them red, may be taken as ultimate and

30:58.760 --> 31:06.040
irreducible, and it may be held that McEx is no better off, in point of real explanatory

31:06.040 --> 31:15.400
power, for all the occult entities which he posits under such names as redness.

31:15.400 --> 31:20.680
One means by which McEx might naturally have tried to impose his ontology of universals

31:20.680 --> 31:28.120
on us was already removed before we turn to the problem of universals.

31:28.120 --> 31:35.720
McEx cannot argue that predicates such as red or is red, which we all concur in using,

31:35.720 --> 31:42.520
must be regarded as names, each of a single universal entity, in order that they be meaningful

31:42.520 --> 31:44.600
at all.

31:44.600 --> 31:53.240
For we have seen that being a name of something is much more special feature than being meaningful.

31:53.240 --> 32:00.120
He cannot even charge us, at least not by that argument, with having posited an attribute

32:00.120 --> 32:05.400
of Pegasizing by our adoption of the predicate Pegasizes.

32:05.400 --> 32:10.040
However, McEx hits upon a different stratagem.

32:10.040 --> 32:18.680
Let us grant, he says, this distinction between meaning and naming of which you make so much.

32:18.680 --> 32:25.480
Let us even grant that is red, Pegasizes, etc., are not names of attributes.

32:25.720 --> 32:32.520
Still, you admit they have meanings, but these meanings, whether they are named or not,

32:33.160 --> 32:40.200
are still universals, and I venture to say that some of them might even be the very

32:40.200 --> 32:45.720
things that I call attributes, or something to much the same purpose in the end.

32:46.440 --> 32:55.080
For McEx, this is an unusually penetrating speech, and the only way I know to counter

32:55.080 --> 32:57.880
it is by refusing to admit meanings.

32:57.880 --> 33:06.600
However, I feel no reluctance towards refusing to admit meanings, for I do not thereby deny

33:06.600 --> 33:09.800
that words and statements are meaningful.

33:09.800 --> 33:17.080
McEx and I may agree to the letter in our classification of linguistic forms into the

33:17.080 --> 33:24.200
meaningful and the meaningless, even though McEx construes meaningfulness as the having,

33:24.840 --> 33:32.440
in some sense of having, of some abstract entity which he calls a meaning, whereas I do not.

33:32.840 --> 33:41.000
I remain free to maintain that the fact that a given linguistic utterance is meaningful,

33:41.720 --> 33:49.000
or significant, as I prefer to say, so as not to invite hypostasis of meanings as entities,

33:49.880 --> 33:58.760
is an ultimate and irreducible matter of fact, or I may undertake to analyze it in terms

33:58.760 --> 34:03.560
directly of what people do in the presence of the linguistic utterance in question,

34:04.120 --> 34:06.760
and other utterances similar to it.

34:08.920 --> 34:17.080
The useful ways in which people ordinarily talk or seem to talk about meanings boil down to two,

34:18.040 --> 34:26.040
the having of meanings, which is significance, and sameness of meaning, or synonymy.

34:26.280 --> 34:35.480
What is called giving the meaning of an utterance is simply the uttering of a synonym couched ordinarily

34:35.480 --> 34:44.040
in clearer language than the original. If we are allergic to meanings as such, we can speak directly

34:44.040 --> 34:54.600
of utterances as significant or insignificant, and as synonymous or heteronymous, one with another.

34:57.000 --> 35:04.200
The problem of explaining these adjectives significant and synonymous with some degree

35:04.200 --> 35:11.880
of clarity and rigor, preferably as I see it in terms of behavior, is as difficult as it is

35:11.880 --> 35:20.600
important. But the explanatory value of special and irreducible intermediary entities called

35:20.600 --> 35:32.520
meanings is surely illusory. Up to now, I have argued that we can use singular terms significantly

35:32.520 --> 35:39.080
in sentences without presupposing that there are entities which those terms purport to name.

35:40.200 --> 35:48.040
I have argued further that we can use general terms, for example predicates, without conceding

35:48.040 --> 35:56.200
them to be names of abstract entities. I have argued further that we can view utterances as

35:56.200 --> 36:05.640
significant, and as synonymous, or heteronymous, with one another, without countenancing a realm

36:05.640 --> 36:14.760
of entities called meanings. At this point, mcx begins to wonder whether there is any limit at all

36:14.760 --> 36:22.440
to our ontological immunity. Does nothing we may say commit us to the assumption of universals,

36:22.440 --> 36:30.040
or other entities which we may find unwelcome? I have already suggested a negative answer to

36:30.040 --> 36:37.080
this question, in speaking of bound variables, or variables of quantification, in connection with

36:37.080 --> 36:44.920
Russell's theory of descriptions. We can very easily involve ourselves in ontological commitments

36:44.920 --> 36:53.400
by saying, for example, that there is something, bound variable, which red houses and sunsets

36:53.400 --> 37:01.160
have in common, or that there is something which is a prime number larger than a million.

37:02.120 --> 37:10.440
But this is essentially the only way we can involve ourselves in ontological commitments,

37:10.440 --> 37:19.640
by our use of bound variables. The use of alleged names is no criterion, for we can repudiate their

37:19.640 --> 37:26.920
namehood at the drop of a hat, unless the assumption of a corresponding entity can be spotted in the

37:26.920 --> 37:36.040
things we affirm in terms of bound variables. Names are, in fact, altogether immaterial to the

37:36.040 --> 37:43.880
ontological issue, for I have shown, in connection with Pegasus and Pegasize, that names can be

37:43.880 --> 37:50.040
converted to descriptions, and Russell has shown that descriptions can be eliminated.

37:50.840 --> 37:58.360
Whatever we say with the help of names can be said in a language which shuns names altogether.

37:58.360 --> 38:06.680
To be assumed as an entity is, purely and simply, to be reckoned as the value of a variable.

38:07.880 --> 38:13.640
In terms of the categories of traditional grammar, this amounts roughly to saying that

38:14.600 --> 38:24.200
to be is to be in the range of reference of a pronoun. Pronouns are the basic media of reference.

38:25.320 --> 38:32.120
Nouns might better have been named pronouns. The variables of quantification,

38:32.840 --> 38:39.960
something, nothing, everything, range over our whole ontology, whatever it may be,

38:40.680 --> 38:47.480
and we are convinced of a particular ontological presupposition if, and only if,

38:48.280 --> 38:56.600
the alleged presuppositum has to be reckoned among the entities over which our variables range

38:56.600 --> 39:06.520
in order to render one of our affirmations true. We may say, for example, that some dogs are white

39:07.000 --> 39:13.480
and not thereby commit ourselves to recognizing either doghood or whiteness as entities.

39:14.760 --> 39:23.560
Some dogs are white says that some things that are dogs are white, and in order that this statement

39:23.560 --> 39:32.360
be true, the things over which the bound variable something ranges must include some white dogs,

39:33.080 --> 39:40.600
but need not include dogness or whiteness. On the other hand, when we say that some

39:40.600 --> 39:47.960
zoological species are cross-fertile, we are committing ourselves to recognizing as entities

39:47.960 --> 39:55.000
the several species themselves, abstract though they are. We remain so committed,

39:55.000 --> 39:59.560
at least until we devise some way of so paraphrasing the statement,

39:59.560 --> 40:04.280
as to show that the seeming reference to species on the part of our bound variable

40:04.840 --> 40:13.000
was unavoidable manner of speaking. Classical mathematics, as the example of

40:13.000 --> 40:20.520
primes larger than a million clearly illustrates, is up to its neck in commitments to an ontology

40:20.520 --> 40:28.120
of abstract entities. Thus it is that the great medieval controversy over universals

40:28.120 --> 40:36.440
has flared up anew in the modern philosophy of mathematics. The issue is clearer now than of old

40:36.440 --> 40:43.800
because we now have a more explicit standard whereby to decide what ontology a given theory

40:43.800 --> 40:54.120
or form of discourse is committed to. A theory is committed to those and only those entities to which

40:54.120 --> 41:02.120
the bound variables of the theory must be capable of referring in order that the affirmations made

41:02.120 --> 41:12.120
in the theory be true. Because this standard of ontological presupposition did not emerge clearly

41:12.120 --> 41:18.680
in the philosophical tradition, the modern philosophical mathematicians have not on the whole

41:18.680 --> 41:25.720
recognized that they were debating the same old problem of universals in a newly clarified form.

41:26.840 --> 41:34.040
But the fundamental cleavages among modern points of view on foundations of mathematics

41:34.040 --> 41:40.600
do come down pretty explicitly to disagreements as to the range of entities to which the bound

41:40.680 --> 41:49.080
variables should be permitted to refer. The three main medieval points of view regarding

41:49.080 --> 41:59.800
universals are designated by historians as realism, conceptualism, and nominalism. Essentially,

42:00.440 --> 42:08.280
these same three doctrines reappear in 20th century surveys of the philosophy of mathematics

42:08.280 --> 42:14.200
under the new names, logicism, intuitionism, and formalism.

42:16.440 --> 42:22.120
Realism, as the word is used in connection with the medieval controversy over universals,

42:23.000 --> 42:32.840
is the platonic doctrine that universals or abstract entities have being independently of the mind.

42:33.800 --> 42:43.880
The mind may discover them but cannot create them. Logicism, represented by Frege, Russell,

42:43.880 --> 42:52.360
Whitehead, Church, and Carnap condones the use of bound variables to refer to abstract entities

42:52.360 --> 42:57.960
known and unknown, specifiable and unspecifiable indiscriminately.

42:57.960 --> 43:09.880
Conceptualism holds that there are universals but they are mind-made. Intuitionism, espoused in

43:09.880 --> 43:19.880
modern times in one form or another by Poincaré, Brower, Veil, and others, countenances the use

43:19.880 --> 43:28.920
of bound variables to refer to abstract entities only when those entities are capable of being

43:28.920 --> 43:36.920
cooked up individually from ingredients specified in advance. As Frankel has put it,

43:37.800 --> 43:45.960
logicism holds that classes are discovered while intuitionism holds that they are invented.

43:46.840 --> 43:52.680
A fair statement indeed of the old opposition between realism and conceptualism.

43:54.520 --> 44:02.440
This opposition is no mere quibble. It makes an essential difference in the amount of classical

44:02.440 --> 44:12.440
mathematics to which one is willing to subscribe. Logicists or realists are able on their assumptions

44:12.520 --> 44:20.760
to get Cantor's ascending orders of infinity. Intuitionists are compelled to stop with the

44:20.760 --> 44:28.360
lowest order of infinity and as an indirect consequence to abandon even some of the classical

44:28.360 --> 44:37.960
laws of real numbers. The modern controversy between logicism and intuitionism arose, in fact,

44:37.960 --> 44:47.720
from disagreements over infinity. Formalism, associated with the name of Hilbert, echoes

44:47.720 --> 44:55.320
intuitionism in deploring the logicist unbridled recourse to universals. But

44:55.960 --> 45:05.320
formalism also finds intuitionism unsatisfactory. This could happen for either of two opposite

45:05.320 --> 45:13.400
reasons. The formalist might, like the logicist, object to the crippling of classical mathematics.

45:14.280 --> 45:22.440
Or he might, like the nominalists of old, object to admitting abstract entities at all,

45:23.400 --> 45:32.200
even in the restrained sense of mind-made entities. The upshot is the same. The formalist

45:32.200 --> 45:39.960
keeps classical mathematics as a play of insignificant notations. This play of notations

45:39.960 --> 45:46.760
can still be of utility, whatever utility it has already shown itself to have as a crutch

45:46.760 --> 45:55.640
for physicists and technologists. But utility need not imply significance in any literal

45:55.640 --> 46:03.320
linguistic sense. Nor need the marked success of mathematicians in spinning out theorems,

46:03.320 --> 46:09.480
and in finding objective basis for agreement with one another's results, imply significance.

46:10.600 --> 46:17.480
For an adequate basis for agreement among mathematicians can be found simply in the rules

46:17.480 --> 46:25.320
which govern the manipulation of the notations. These syntactical rules being, unlike the

46:25.320 --> 46:33.720
notations themselves, quite significant and intelligible. I have argued that the sort of

46:33.720 --> 46:41.320
ontology we adopt can be consequential, notably in connection with mathematics, although this

46:41.320 --> 46:51.720
is only an example. Now, how are we to adjudicate among rival ontologies? Certainly, the answer

46:51.720 --> 46:58.520
is not provided by the semantical formula to be is to be the value of a variable.

46:59.640 --> 47:06.600
This formula serves, rather conversely, in testing the conformity of a given remark

47:06.600 --> 47:15.160
or doctrine to a prior ontological standard. We look to bound variables in connection with ontology,

47:15.800 --> 47:23.080
not in order to know what there is, but in order to know what a given remark or doctrine,

47:23.720 --> 47:33.480
ours or someone else's, says there is. And this much is quite properly a problem involving language,

47:34.360 --> 47:43.240
but what there is is another question. In debating over what there is, there are still

47:43.240 --> 47:50.760
reasons for operating on a semantical plane. One reason is to escape from the predicament

47:50.760 --> 47:57.640
noted at the beginning of this essay, the predicament of my not being able to admit

47:57.640 --> 48:07.080
that there are things which MacX countenances and I do not. So long as I adhere to my ontology,

48:07.080 --> 48:15.320
as opposed to MacX's, I cannot allow my bound variables to refer to entities which belong

48:15.320 --> 48:24.680
to MacX's ontology and not to mine. I can, however, consistently describe our disagreement

48:25.240 --> 48:32.520
by characterizing the statements which MacX affirms, provided merely that my ontology

48:32.520 --> 48:38.760
countenances linguistic forms, or at least concrete inscriptions and utterances,

48:39.560 --> 48:46.840
I can talk about MacX's sentences. Another reason for withdrawing to a semantical plane

48:47.400 --> 48:56.360
is to find common ground on which to argue. Disagreement in ontology involves basic disagreement

48:56.360 --> 49:02.920
in conceptual schemes, yet MacX and I, despite these basic disagreements,

49:03.720 --> 49:10.360
find that our conceptual schemes converge sufficiently in their intermediate and upper

49:10.360 --> 49:17.480
ramifications to enable us to communicate successfully on topics such as politics,

49:18.040 --> 49:27.560
weather, and, in particular, language. Insofar as our basic controversy over ontology

49:27.560 --> 49:33.720
can be translated upward into a semantical controversy about words and what to do with them,

49:34.360 --> 49:39.480
the collapse of the controversy into question begging may be delayed.

49:39.960 --> 49:46.920
It is no wonder, then, that ontological controversy should tend into controversy over

49:46.920 --> 49:57.000
language, but we must not jump to the conclusion that what there is depends on words. Translate

49:57.000 --> 50:04.600
ability of a question into semantical terms is no indication that the question is linguistic.

50:04.680 --> 50:12.520
To see Naples is to bear a name which, when prefixed to the words C's Naples,

50:12.520 --> 50:20.520
yields a true sentence. Still, there is nothing linguistic about seeing Naples.

50:22.680 --> 50:31.320
Our acceptance of an ontology is, I think, similar in principle to our acceptance of a

50:32.040 --> 50:41.960
scientific theory, say a system of physics. We adopt, at least insofar as we are reasonable,

50:42.600 --> 50:49.080
the simplest conceptual scheme into which the disordered fragments of raw experience

50:49.080 --> 50:57.640
can be fitted and arranged. Our ontology is determined once we have fixed upon the

50:57.640 --> 51:03.320
overall conceptual scheme which is to accommodate science in the broadest sense,

51:04.200 --> 51:09.960
and the considerations which determine a reasonable construction of any part of that

51:09.960 --> 51:17.640
conceptual scheme, for example, the biological or the physical part, are not different in kind

51:17.640 --> 51:22.680
from the considerations which determine a reasonable construction of the whole.

51:23.320 --> 51:29.960
To whatever extent the adoption of any system of scientific theory may be said to be a matter

51:29.960 --> 51:37.240
of language, the same, but no more, may be said of the adoption of an ontology.

51:39.160 --> 51:46.680
But simplicity as a guiding principle in constructing conceptual schemes is not a clear

51:46.840 --> 51:57.640
and unambiguous idea, and it is quite capable of presenting a double or multiple standard.

51:59.080 --> 52:06.680
Imagine, for example, that we have devised the most economical set of concepts adequate to the

52:06.680 --> 52:15.720
play-by-play reporting of immediate experience. The entities under this scheme, the values of

52:15.720 --> 52:24.680
bound variables, are, let us suppose, individual subjective events of sensation or reflection.

52:25.960 --> 52:34.040
We should still find, no doubt, that a physicalistic conceptual scheme purporting to talk about

52:34.040 --> 52:40.520
external objects offers great advantages in simplifying our overall reports.

52:41.960 --> 52:48.280
By bringing together scattered sense events and treating them as perceptions of one object,

52:49.080 --> 52:56.040
we reduce the complexity of our stream of experience to a manageable conceptual simplicity.

52:56.440 --> 53:03.400
The rule of simplicity is indeed our guiding maxim in assigning sense data to objects.

53:04.280 --> 53:10.680
We associate an earlier and a later round-sensum with the same so-called penny,

53:11.320 --> 53:18.440
or with two different so-called pennies, in obedience to the demands of maximum simplicity

53:18.840 --> 53:20.680
in our total world picture.

53:21.400 --> 53:34.040
Here we have two competing conceptual schemes, a phenomenalistic one and a physicalistic one,

53:35.320 --> 53:44.040
which should prevail. Each has its advantages. Each has its special simplicity in its own way.

53:44.040 --> 53:53.000
Each, I suggest, deserves to be developed. Each may be said, indeed, to be the more fundamental,

53:53.720 --> 54:02.280
though in different senses. The one is epistemologically, the other physically fundamental.

54:04.600 --> 54:11.400
The physical conceptual scheme simplifies our account of experience because of the way

54:11.400 --> 54:17.240
myriad scattered sense events come to be associated with single so-called objects.

54:18.360 --> 54:25.240
Still, there is no likelihood that each sentence about physical objects can actually be translated,

54:25.800 --> 54:31.320
however deviously and complexly, into the phenomenalistic language.

54:32.280 --> 54:41.160
Physical objects are postulated entities, which round out and simplify our account of the flux

54:41.160 --> 54:48.920
of experience, just as the introduction of irrational numbers simplifies laws of arithmetic.

54:51.000 --> 54:56.520
From the point of view of the conceptual scheme of the elementary arithmetic of

54:56.600 --> 55:03.400
rational numbers alone, the broader arithmetic of rational and irrational numbers would have

55:03.400 --> 55:10.840
the status of a convenient myth, simpler than the literal truth, namely the arithmetic of

55:10.840 --> 55:20.120
rationals, and yet containing that literal truth as a scattered part. Similarly, from a

55:20.120 --> 55:27.080
phenomenalistic point of view, the conceptual scheme of physical objects is a convenient myth,

55:28.040 --> 55:34.280
simpler than the literal truth and yet containing that literal truth as a scattered part.

55:35.960 --> 55:41.320
Now, what of classes or attributes of physical objects, in turn?

55:42.280 --> 55:49.960
A Platonistic ontology of this sort is, from the point of view of a strictly physicalistic

55:49.960 --> 55:58.840
conceptual scheme, as much a myth as that physicalistic conceptual scheme itself is for phenomenalism.

56:00.680 --> 56:09.480
This higher myth is a good and useful one, in turn, insofar as it simplifies our account of physics.

56:10.440 --> 56:17.560
Since mathematics is an integral part of this higher myth, the utility of this myth for physical

56:17.560 --> 56:25.880
science is evident enough. In speaking of it nevertheless as a myth, I echo that philosophy

56:25.880 --> 56:35.000
of mathematics to which I alluded earlier under the name of formalism. But an attitude of formalism

56:35.080 --> 56:42.440
may with equal justice be adopted toward the physical conceptual scheme, in turn, by the pure

56:42.440 --> 56:51.320
ascete or phenomenalist. The analogy between the myth of mathematics and the myth of physics is,

56:52.040 --> 57:00.040
in some additional and perhaps fortuitous ways, strikingly close. Consider, for example,

57:00.040 --> 57:05.400
the crisis which was precipitated in the foundations of mathematics at the turn of

57:05.400 --> 57:11.640
the century by the discovery of Russell's paradox and other antinomies of set theory.

57:12.680 --> 57:21.960
These contradictions had to be obviated by unintuitive ad hoc devices. Our mathematical

57:21.960 --> 57:31.880
myth making became deliberate and evident to all. But what of physics? An antinomy rose between the

57:31.880 --> 57:38.520
undular and corpuscular accounts of light, and if this was not as out and out a contradiction

57:38.520 --> 57:46.280
as Russell's paradox, I suspect that the reason is that physics is not as out and out as mathematics.

57:47.240 --> 57:55.640
Again, the second great modern crisis in the foundations of mathematics, precipitated in 1931

57:55.640 --> 58:00.680
by Gertl's prove that there are bound to be undecidable statements in arithmetic,

58:01.320 --> 58:07.480
has its companion piece in physics, in Heisenberg's indeterminancy principle.

58:07.640 --> 58:16.680
In earlier pages, I undertook to show that some common arguments in favor of certain ontologies

58:16.680 --> 58:23.960
are fallacious. Further, I advanced an explicit standard whereby to decide what the ontological

58:23.960 --> 58:31.800
commitments of a theory are. But the question what ontology actually to adopt still stands open,

58:32.440 --> 58:36.600
and the obvious counsel is tolerance and an experimental spirit.

58:37.720 --> 58:44.280
Let us by all means see how much of the physicalistic conceptual scheme can be reduced to a

58:44.280 --> 58:53.480
phenomenalistic one. Still, physics also naturally demands pursuing, irreducible in Toto, though it

58:53.480 --> 59:02.200
may be. Let us see how, or to what degree, natural science may be rendered independent

59:02.200 --> 59:10.040
of Platonistic mathematics. But let us also pursue mathematics and delve into its Platonistic

59:10.040 --> 59:17.800
foundations. From among the various conceptual schemes best suited to these various pursuits,

59:18.760 --> 59:28.600
one, the phenomenalistic, claims epistemological priority. Viewed from within the phenomenalistic

59:28.600 --> 59:36.120
conceptual scheme, the ontologies of physical objects and mathematical objects are myths.

59:37.400 --> 59:46.040
The quality of myth, however, is relative. Relative, in this case, to the epistemological

59:46.040 --> 59:55.800
point of view. This point of view is one among various, corresponding to one among our various

59:55.800 --> 01:00:05.560
interests and purposes.
