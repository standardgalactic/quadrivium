0	11300	On What There Is by Willard Van Orman Quine, published in 1948.
11300	17600	A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity.
17600	24040	It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.
24040	27400	What is there?
27400	33760	It can be answered, moreover, in a word—everything.
33760	38200	And everyone will accept this answer as true.
38200	44960	However, this is merely to say that there is what there is.
44960	51400	There remains room for disagreement over cases, and so the issue has stayed alive down the
51400	54200	centuries.
54200	62400	Suppose now that two philosophers, MacX and I, differ over ontology.
62400	70200	Suppose MacX maintains there is something which I maintain there is not.
70200	77120	MacX can, quite consistently with his own point of view, describe our difference of opinion
77120	82320	by saying that I refuse to recognize certain entities.
82320	88160	I should protest, of course, that he is wrong in his formulation of our disagreement, for
88160	96080	I maintain that there are no entities of the kind which he alleges, for me to recognize.
96080	102560	But my finding him wrong in his formulation of our disagreement is unimportant, for I
102560	108400	am committed to considering him wrong in his ontology anyway.
108400	114440	When I try to formulate our difference of opinion, on the other hand, I seem to be in
114440	116360	a predicament.
116360	123400	I cannot admit that there are some things which MacX countenances and I do not, for,
123400	128560	in admitting that there are such things, I should be contradicting my own rejection of
128560	130400	them.
130400	137840	It would appear, if this reasoning were sound, that, in any ontological dispute, the proponent
137840	144440	of the negative side suffers the disadvantage of not being able to admit that his opponent
144440	147000	disagrees with him.
147000	151560	This is the old platonic riddle of non-being.
151560	156480	Non-being must, in some sense, be.
156480	161840	Otherwise, what is it that there is not?
161840	166440	This tangled doctrine might be nicknamed Plato's Beard.
166440	174240	Historically, it is proved tough, frequently dulling the edge of Occam's razor.
174240	181080	It is some such line of thought that leads philosophers like MacX to impute being where
181080	186600	they might otherwise be quite content to recognize that there is nothing.
186600	190440	Thus, take Pegasus.
190440	197600	If Pegasus were not, MacX argues, we should not be talking about anything when we use the
197600	198800	word.
198800	206480	Therefore, it would be nonsense to say even that Pegasus is not.
206480	212380	Thinking to show thus that the denial of Pegasus cannot be coherently maintained, he concludes
212380	215520	that Pegasus is.
215520	224320	MacX cannot, indeed, quite persuade himself that any region of space-time near or remote
224320	228600	contains a flying horse of flesh and blood.
228600	237120	Pressed for further details on Pegasus, then, he says that Pegasus is an idea in men's minds.
237120	241960	Here, however, a confusion begins to be apparent.
241960	248960	We may, for the sake of argument, concede that there is an entity, and even a unique
248960	255840	entity, though this is rather implausible, which is the mental Pegasus idea.
255840	263920	But this mental entity is not what people are talking about when they deny Pegasus.
263920	269680	MacX confuses the Parthenon with the Parthenon idea.
269680	278600	The Parthenon is physical, the Parthenon idea is mental, according anyway to MacX's version
278600	283000	of ideas, and I have no better to offer.
283000	290280	The Parthenon is visible, the Parthenon idea is invisible.
290280	298560	We cannot easily imagine two things more unlike, and less liable to confusion, than the Parthenon
298560	301560	and the Parthenon idea.
301560	308200	But when we shift from the Parthenon to Pegasus, the confusion sets in.
308200	314720	For no other reason than MacX would sooner be deceived by the crudest and most flagrant
314720	320320	counterfeit than grant the non-being of Pegasus.
320320	327080	The notion that Pegasus must be, because it would otherwise be nonsense to say even that
327080	335640	Pegasus is not, has been seen to lead MacX into an elementary confusion.
335640	341540	Subtler minds, taking the same precept as their starting point, come out with theories
341540	349240	of Pegasus which are less patently misguided than MacX's, and correspondingly more difficult
349240	351840	to eradicate.
351840	358600	One of these subtler minds is named, let us say, Wyman.
358600	366900	Pegasus, Wyman maintains, has his being as an unactualized possible.
366900	374480	When we say of Pegasus that there is no such thing, we are saying more precisely that Pegasus
374480	380000	does not have the special attribute of actuality.
380000	387320	Saying that Pegasus is not actual is on par, logically, with saying that the Parthenon is
387320	388820	not red.
388820	397640	In either case, we are saying something about an entity whose being is unquestioned.
397640	404000	Wyman, by the way, is one of those philosophers who have united in ruining the good old word
404000	407040	exist.
407040	416560	Despite his espousal of unactualized possibilities, he limits the word existence to actuality,
416560	423560	thus preserving an illusion of ontological agreement between himself and us who repudiate
423560	427320	the rest of his bloated universe.
427320	432320	We have all been prone to say, in our common sense usage of exist, that we have all been
432320	440680	prone to say, in our common sense usage of exist, that Pegasus does not exist, meaning
440680	446320	simply that there is no such entity at all.
446320	452680	If Pegasus existed, he would indeed be in space and time.
452680	461960	But only because the word Pegasus has spatiotemporal connotations, and not because exists has
461960	466160	spatiotemporal connotations.
466160	472960	If spatiotemporal reference is lacking when we affirm the existence of the cube root of
472960	481880	twenty-seven, this is simply because a cube root is not a spatiotemporal kind of thing,
481880	487600	and not because we are being ambiguous in our use of exist.
488280	496280	However, Wyman, in an ill-conceived effort to appear agreeable, genially grants us the
496280	504200	non-existence of Pegasus, and then, contrary to what we meant by non-existence of Pegasus,
504200	509440	insists that Pegasus is.
509440	515880	Existence is one thing, he says, and subsistence is another.
515880	523560	The only way I know of coping with this obfuscation of issues is to give Wyman the word exist.
523560	528400	I'll not try to use it again, I still have is.
528400	535160	So much for lexicography, let's go back to Wyman's ontology.
535160	542100	Wyman's overpopulated universe is, in many ways, unlovely.
542100	549340	It offends the aesthetic sense of us who have a taste for desert landscapes, but this is
549340	551980	not the worst of it.
551980	558820	Wyman's slum of possibles is a breeding ground for disorderly elements.
558820	565340	Take, for instance, the possible fat man in that doorway, and again, the possible bald
565340	567780	man in that doorway.
567780	573340	Are they the same possible man, or two possible men?
573340	575140	How do we decide?
575140	579460	How many possible men are there in that doorway?
579460	583300	Are there more possible thin ones than fat ones?
583300	585860	How many of them are alike?
585860	590500	Or would their being alike make them one?
590500	593900	Are no two possible things alike?
593900	600580	Is this the same as saying that it is impossible for two things to be alike?
600580	610860	Or finally, is the concept of identity simply inapplicable to unactualized possibles?
610860	617540	But what sense can be found in talking of entities which cannot meaningfully be said
617540	623620	to be identical with themselves and distinct from one another?
623620	628180	These elements are well nigh incorrigible.
628180	635900	By a Phragian therapy of individual concepts, some effort might be made at rehabilitation,
635900	643740	but I feel we'd do better simply to clear Wyman's slum and be done with it.
643740	651620	Possibility, along with other modalities of necessity and impossibility and contingency,
651620	658020	poses problems upon which I do not mean to imply that we should turn our backs.
658020	664460	But we can at least limit modalities to whole statements.
664460	672580	We may impose the adverb possibly upon a statement as a whole, and we may well worry about the
672580	680620	semantical analysis of such usage, but little real advance in such analysis is to be hoped
680620	687020	for in expanding our universe to include so-called possible entities.
687020	694460	I suspect that the main motive for this expansion is simply the old notion that Pegasus, for
694460	702620	example, must be because otherwise it would be nonsense to say even that he is not.
702620	710180	Still, all the rank luxuriance of Wyman's universe of possibles would seem to come to
710180	717820	not when we make a slight change in the example and speak not of Pegasus, but of the round
717820	722780	square cupula on Berkeley College.
722780	730900	If unless Pegasus were, it would be nonsense to say that he is not, then by the same token,
730900	736700	unless the round square cupula on Berkeley College were, it would be nonsense to say
736700	739740	that it is not.
739740	748340	But unlike Pegasus, the round square cupula on Berkeley College cannot be admitted even
748340	752240	as an unactualized possible.
752240	760100	Can we drive Wyman now to admitting also a realm of unactualizable impossibles?
760100	766200	If so, a good many embarrassing questions could be asked about them.
766200	772100	We might even hope to trap Wyman in contradictions by getting him to admit that certain of these
772100	775980	entities are at once round and square.
775980	783180	But the wily Wyman chooses the other horn of the dilemma and concludes that it is nonsense
783180	787960	to say that the round square cupula on Berkeley College is not.
787960	795120	He says that the phrase round square cupula is meaningless.
795120	799760	Wyman was not the first to embrace this alternative.
799760	805800	The doctrine of the meaninglessness of contradictions runs away back.
805800	813400	The tradition survives, moreover, in writers who seem to share none of Wyman's motivations.
814160	821120	Still, I wonder whether the first temptation to such a doctrine may not have been substantially
821120	824920	the motivation which we have observed in Wyman.
824920	833880	Certainly, the doctrine has no intrinsic appeal, and it has led its devotees to such quixotic
833880	840480	extremes as that of challenging the method of proof by reductio ad absurdum, a challenge
840560	846000	in which I sense a reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine itself.
846000	853500	Moreover, the doctrine of meaninglessness of contradictions has the severe methodological
853500	861000	drawback that it makes it impossible, in principle, ever to devise an effective test of what is
861000	864600	meaningful and what is not.
864600	871560	It would be forever impossible for us to devise systematic ways of deciding whether a string
871560	879840	of signs made sense, even to us individually, let alone other people, or not.
879840	886080	For it follows from a discovery in mathematical logic, due to church, that there can be no
886080	891280	generally applicable test of contradictoryness.
891280	898040	I have spoken disparagingly of Plato's beard, and hinted that it is tangled.
898040	902720	I have dwelt at length on the inconveniences of putting up with it.
902720	906560	It is time to think about taking steps.
906560	913480	Russell, in his theory of so-called singular descriptions, showed clearly how we might
913480	921280	meaningfully use seeming names without supposing that there be entities allegedly named.
921280	927560	The names to which Russell's theory directly applies are complex, descriptive names, such
927560	935000	as the author of Waverly, the present king of France, the round square cupula on Berkeley
935000	937200	College.
937200	944560	Russell analyses such phrases systematically as fragments of the whole sentences in which
944560	946640	they occur.
946640	955200	The sentence, the author of Waverly was a poet, for example, is explained as a whole as meaning
955200	965320	someone, better, something, wrote Waverly, and was a poet, and nothing else wrote Waverly.
965320	970400	The point of this added clause is to affirm the uniqueness, which is implicit in the word
970400	975080	the, in the author of Waverly.
975080	982440	The sentence, the round square cupula on Berkeley College is pink, is explained as something
982440	990320	is round and square, and is a cupula on Berkeley College, and is pink, and nothing else is round
990320	995400	and square and a cupula on Berkeley College.
995400	1003720	The virtue of this analysis is that the seeming name, a descriptive phrase, is paraphrased
1003720	1009240	in context as a so-called incomplete symbol.
1009240	1015920	No unified expression is offered as an analysis of the descriptive phrase, but the statement
1015920	1022480	as a whole, which was the context of that phrase, still gets its full quota of meaning,
1022480	1025800	whether true or false.
1025800	1032680	The unanalyzed statement, the author of Waverly was a poet, contains a part, the author of
1032680	1040240	Waverly, which is wrongly supposed by McEx and Wyman, to demand objective reference
1040240	1043320	in order to be meaningful at all.
1043320	1050040	But in Russell's translation, something wrote Waverly and was a poet, and nothing else
1050040	1057520	wrote Waverly, the burden of objective reference, which had been put upon the descriptive phrase,
1057520	1065160	is now taken over by words of the kind that logicians call bound variables, variables
1065160	1073680	of quantification, namely words like something, nothing, everything.
1073680	1079600	These words, far from purporting to be names specifically of the author of Waverly, do
1079600	1083280	not purport to be names at all.
1083280	1092560	They refer to entities generally, with a kind of studied ambiguity peculiar to themselves.
1092560	1100920	These quantificational words or bound variables are, of course, a basic part of language,
1100920	1107480	and their meaningfulness, at least in context, is not to be challenged.
1107480	1114880	But their meaningfulness in no way presupposes there being either the author of Waverly or
1114880	1123080	the round square cupula on Berkeley College or any other specifically pre-assigned objects.
1123080	1130280	Where descriptions are concerned, there is no longer any difficulty in affirming or denying
1130280	1131960	being.
1131960	1139600	There is the author of Waverly, is explained by Russell as meaning someone, or more strictly
1139600	1145760	something, wrote Waverly and nothing else wrote Waverly.
1145760	1153880	The author of Waverly is not, is explained correspondingly as the alternation, either
1153880	1161080	each thing failed to write Waverly or two or more things wrote Waverly.
1161080	1167760	This alternation is false, but meaningful, and it contains no expression purporting to
1167760	1171040	name the author of Waverly.
1171040	1180240	The statement the round square cupula on Berkeley College is not, is analyzed in similar fashion.
1180240	1187640	So the old notion that statements of non-being defeat themselves goes by the board.
1187640	1194280	When a statement of being or non-being is analyzed by Russell's theory of descriptions,
1194280	1200680	it ceases to contain any expression which even purports to name the alleged entity whose
1200680	1207200	being is in question, so that the meaningfulness of the statement no longer can be thought
1207200	1212360	to presuppose that there be such an entity.
1212360	1215280	Now what of Pegasus?
1215280	1221080	This being a word rather than a descriptive phrase, Russell's argument does not immediately
1221080	1222960	apply to it.
1222960	1227720	However, it can easily be made to apply.
1227720	1235120	We have only to rephrase Pegasus as a description in any way that seems adequately to single
1235120	1243120	out our idea, say, the winged horse that was captured by Balerophon.
1243120	1249600	Substituting such a phrase for Pegasus, we can then proceed to analyze the statement
1249600	1257600	Pegasus is or Pegasus is not, precisely on the analogy of Russell's analysis of the
1257600	1264040	author of Waverly is and the author of Waverly is not.
1264040	1270680	In order thus to subsume a one-word name or a legend name such as Pegasus under Russell's
1270680	1278080	theory of description, we must, of course, be able first to translate the word into a
1278080	1279720	description.
1279720	1283040	But this is no real restriction.
1283040	1290800	If the notion of Pegasus had been so obscure or so basic a one that no pat translation
1290800	1296560	into a descriptive phrase had offered itself along familiar lines, we could still have
1296560	1302520	availed ourselves of the following artificial and trivial seeming device.
1302520	1311040	We could have appealed to the ex-hypothesis unanalyzable, irreducible attribute of being
1311040	1319600	Pegasus, adopting for its expression the verb is Pegasus or Pegasizes.
1319600	1327040	The noun Pegasus itself could then be treated as derivative and identified, after all, with
1327040	1335160	a description, the thing that is Pegasus, the thing that Pegasizes.
1335160	1342400	If the importing of such a predicate as Pegasizes seems to commit us to recognizing that there
1342400	1349560	is a corresponding attribute Pegasizing in Plato's heaven or in the minds of men, well
1349560	1359380	and good, neither we nor Wyman nor MacX could have been contending thus far about the being
1359380	1365840	or non-being of universals, but rather about that of Pegasus.
1365840	1372880	If in terms of Pegasizing we can interpret the noun Pegasus as a description, subject
1372880	1380440	to Russell's theory of descriptions, then we have disposed of the old notion that Pegasus
1380440	1389520	cannot be said not to be without presupposing that in some sense Pegasus is.
1389520	1392560	Our argument is now quite general.
1392560	1399040	MacX and Wyman supposed that we could not meaningfully affirm a statement of the form
1399040	1407040	so-and-so is not, with a simple or descriptive singular noun in place of so-and-so unless
1407040	1410040	so-and-so is.
1410040	1418440	This supposition is now seen to be quite generally groundless, since the singular noun in question
1418440	1426480	can always be expanded into a singular description, trivially or otherwise, and then analyzed out
1426480	1429640	of Russell.
1429640	1435580	We commit ourselves to an ontology-containing numbers when we say there are prime numbers
1435580	1437600	larger than a million.
1437600	1444000	We commit ourselves to an ontology-containing centars when we say there are centars.
1444000	1450840	And we commit ourselves to an ontology-containing Pegasus when we say Pegasus is.
1450840	1459480	But we do not commit ourselves to an ontology-containing Pegasus or the author of Waverly or the round
1459480	1465640	square cupula on Berkeley College when we say that Pegasus or the author of Waverly
1465640	1470160	or the cupula in question is not.
1470160	1476240	We need no longer labor under the delusion that the meaningfulness of a statement containing
1476240	1482440	a singular term presupposes an entity named by the term.
1482440	1489800	A singular term need not name to be significant.
1489800	1496800	An inkling of this might have dawned on Wyman and McEx even without benefit of Russell if
1496800	1506600	they had only noticed, as so few of us do, that there is a gulf between meaning and naming.
1506600	1513360	Even in the case of a singular term, which is genuinely a name of an object, the following
1513360	1517040	example from Frege will serve.
1517040	1525360	The phrase evening star names a certain large physical object of spherical form which is
1525360	1531280	hurtling through space some scores of millions of miles from here.
1531280	1538760	The phrase morning star names the same thing, as was probably first established by some
1538760	1546880	observant Babylonian, but the two phrases cannot be regarded as having the same meaning.
1546880	1553560	Otherwise, that Babylonian could have dispensed with his observations and contented himself
1553600	1557800	with reflecting on the meanings of his words.
1557800	1565440	The meanings then, being different from one another, must be other than the named object,
1565440	1571160	which is one and the same in both cases.
1571160	1577960	Confusion of meaning with naming not only made McEx think he could not meaningfully repudiate
1577960	1584240	Pegasus, a continuing confusion of meaning with naming no doubt helped and gender his
1584240	1590240	absurd notion that Pegasus is an idea, a mental entity.
1590240	1594400	The structure of his confusion is as follows.
1594400	1603160	He confused the alleged named object Pegasus with the meaning of the word Pegasus, therefore
1603200	1610160	concluding that Pegasus must be in order that the word have meaning.
1610160	1614040	But what sorts of things are meanings?
1614040	1620440	This is a moot point, however, one might quite plausibly explain meanings as ideas in the
1620440	1628040	mind, supposing we can make clear sense in turn of the idea of ideas in the mind.
1628040	1636880	Or Pegasus, initially confused with a meaning, ends up as an idea in the mind.
1636880	1643960	It is the more remarkable that Wyman, subject to the same initial motivation as McEx, should
1643960	1651960	have avoided this particular blunder and wound up with unactualized possibles instead.
1651960	1657600	Now let us return to the ontological problem of universals.
1657600	1665160	The question whether there are such entities as attributes, relations, classes, numbers,
1665160	1673160	functions, McEx, characteristically enough, thinks there are.
1673160	1680720	Speaking of attributes, he says, there are red houses, red roses, red sunsets.
1680720	1686880	This much is pre-philosophical common sense in which we must all agree.
1686880	1694000	These houses, roses, and sunsets, then, have something in common, and this, which they
1694000	1700640	have in common, is all I mean by the attribute of redness.
1700640	1707880	For McEx, thus, their being attributes is even more obvious and trivial than the obvious
1707880	1714680	and trivial fact of their being red houses, roses, and sunsets.
1714680	1721720	This, I think, is characteristic of metaphysics, or at least of that part of metaphysics called
1721720	1724480	ontology.
1724480	1729920	One who regards a statement on the subject as true at all must regard it as trivially
1729920	1731960	true.
1731960	1739480	One's ontology is basic to the conceptual scheme by which he interprets all experiences,
1739480	1743040	even the most commonplace ones.
1743160	1749920	Within some particular conceptual scheme, and how else is judgment possible, an ontological
1749920	1758880	statement goes without saying, standing in need of no separate justification at all.
1758880	1764720	Ontological statements follow immediately from all manner of causal statements of commonplace
1764720	1771960	fact, just as, from the point of view anyway of McEx's conceptual scheme, there is an
1771960	1781440	attribute, follows from, there are red houses, red roses, red sunsets.
1781440	1789040	Judged in another conceptual scheme, an ontological statement which is axiomatic to McEx's mind
1789040	1796440	may, with equal immediacy and triviality, be a judged false.
1796440	1803760	One may admit that there are red houses, roses, and sunsets, but deny, except as a popular
1803760	1810480	and misleading manner of speaking, that they have anything in common.
1810480	1818160	The words, houses, roses, and sunsets are true of sundry individual entities which are
1818160	1826440	houses and roses and sunsets, and the word red, or red object, is true of each of sundry
1826440	1832040	individual entities which are red houses, red roses, red sunsets.
1832040	1839560	But there is not, in addition, any entity whatever, individual or otherwise, which is
1839560	1851400	named by the word redness, nor, for that matter, by the word househood, rosehood, sunsethood.
1851400	1858760	That the houses and roses and sunsets are all of them red, may be taken as ultimate and
1858760	1866040	irreducible, and it may be held that McEx is no better off, in point of real explanatory
1866040	1875400	power, for all the occult entities which he posits under such names as redness.
1875400	1880680	One means by which McEx might naturally have tried to impose his ontology of universals
1880680	1888120	on us was already removed before we turn to the problem of universals.
1888120	1895720	McEx cannot argue that predicates such as red or is red, which we all concur in using,
1895720	1902520	must be regarded as names, each of a single universal entity, in order that they be meaningful
1902520	1904600	at all.
1904600	1913240	For we have seen that being a name of something is much more special feature than being meaningful.
1913240	1920120	He cannot even charge us, at least not by that argument, with having posited an attribute
1920120	1925400	of Pegasizing by our adoption of the predicate Pegasizes.
1925400	1930040	However, McEx hits upon a different stratagem.
1930040	1938680	Let us grant, he says, this distinction between meaning and naming of which you make so much.
1938680	1945480	Let us even grant that is red, Pegasizes, etc., are not names of attributes.
1945720	1952520	Still, you admit they have meanings, but these meanings, whether they are named or not,
1953160	1960200	are still universals, and I venture to say that some of them might even be the very
1960200	1965720	things that I call attributes, or something to much the same purpose in the end.
1966440	1975080	For McEx, this is an unusually penetrating speech, and the only way I know to counter
1975080	1977880	it is by refusing to admit meanings.
1977880	1986600	However, I feel no reluctance towards refusing to admit meanings, for I do not thereby deny
1986600	1989800	that words and statements are meaningful.
1989800	1997080	McEx and I may agree to the letter in our classification of linguistic forms into the
1997080	2004200	meaningful and the meaningless, even though McEx construes meaningfulness as the having,
2004840	2012440	in some sense of having, of some abstract entity which he calls a meaning, whereas I do not.
2012840	2021000	I remain free to maintain that the fact that a given linguistic utterance is meaningful,
2021720	2029000	or significant, as I prefer to say, so as not to invite hypostasis of meanings as entities,
2029880	2038760	is an ultimate and irreducible matter of fact, or I may undertake to analyze it in terms
2038760	2043560	directly of what people do in the presence of the linguistic utterance in question,
2044120	2046760	and other utterances similar to it.
2048920	2057080	The useful ways in which people ordinarily talk or seem to talk about meanings boil down to two,
2058040	2066040	the having of meanings, which is significance, and sameness of meaning, or synonymy.
2066280	2075480	What is called giving the meaning of an utterance is simply the uttering of a synonym couched ordinarily
2075480	2084040	in clearer language than the original. If we are allergic to meanings as such, we can speak directly
2084040	2094600	of utterances as significant or insignificant, and as synonymous or heteronymous, one with another.
2097000	2104200	The problem of explaining these adjectives significant and synonymous with some degree
2104200	2111880	of clarity and rigor, preferably as I see it in terms of behavior, is as difficult as it is
2111880	2120600	important. But the explanatory value of special and irreducible intermediary entities called
2120600	2132520	meanings is surely illusory. Up to now, I have argued that we can use singular terms significantly
2132520	2139080	in sentences without presupposing that there are entities which those terms purport to name.
2140200	2148040	I have argued further that we can use general terms, for example predicates, without conceding
2148040	2156200	them to be names of abstract entities. I have argued further that we can view utterances as
2156200	2165640	significant, and as synonymous, or heteronymous, with one another, without countenancing a realm
2165640	2174760	of entities called meanings. At this point, mcx begins to wonder whether there is any limit at all
2174760	2182440	to our ontological immunity. Does nothing we may say commit us to the assumption of universals,
2182440	2190040	or other entities which we may find unwelcome? I have already suggested a negative answer to
2190040	2197080	this question, in speaking of bound variables, or variables of quantification, in connection with
2197080	2204920	Russell's theory of descriptions. We can very easily involve ourselves in ontological commitments
2204920	2213400	by saying, for example, that there is something, bound variable, which red houses and sunsets
2213400	2221160	have in common, or that there is something which is a prime number larger than a million.
2222120	2230440	But this is essentially the only way we can involve ourselves in ontological commitments,
2230440	2239640	by our use of bound variables. The use of alleged names is no criterion, for we can repudiate their
2239640	2246920	namehood at the drop of a hat, unless the assumption of a corresponding entity can be spotted in the
2246920	2256040	things we affirm in terms of bound variables. Names are, in fact, altogether immaterial to the
2256040	2263880	ontological issue, for I have shown, in connection with Pegasus and Pegasize, that names can be
2263880	2270040	converted to descriptions, and Russell has shown that descriptions can be eliminated.
2270840	2278360	Whatever we say with the help of names can be said in a language which shuns names altogether.
2278360	2286680	To be assumed as an entity is, purely and simply, to be reckoned as the value of a variable.
2287880	2293640	In terms of the categories of traditional grammar, this amounts roughly to saying that
2294600	2304200	to be is to be in the range of reference of a pronoun. Pronouns are the basic media of reference.
2305320	2312120	Nouns might better have been named pronouns. The variables of quantification,
2312840	2319960	something, nothing, everything, range over our whole ontology, whatever it may be,
2320680	2327480	and we are convinced of a particular ontological presupposition if, and only if,
2328280	2336600	the alleged presuppositum has to be reckoned among the entities over which our variables range
2336600	2346520	in order to render one of our affirmations true. We may say, for example, that some dogs are white
2347000	2353480	and not thereby commit ourselves to recognizing either doghood or whiteness as entities.
2354760	2363560	Some dogs are white says that some things that are dogs are white, and in order that this statement
2363560	2372360	be true, the things over which the bound variable something ranges must include some white dogs,
2373080	2380600	but need not include dogness or whiteness. On the other hand, when we say that some
2380600	2387960	zoological species are cross-fertile, we are committing ourselves to recognizing as entities
2387960	2395000	the several species themselves, abstract though they are. We remain so committed,
2395000	2399560	at least until we devise some way of so paraphrasing the statement,
2399560	2404280	as to show that the seeming reference to species on the part of our bound variable
2404840	2413000	was unavoidable manner of speaking. Classical mathematics, as the example of
2413000	2420520	primes larger than a million clearly illustrates, is up to its neck in commitments to an ontology
2420520	2428120	of abstract entities. Thus it is that the great medieval controversy over universals
2428120	2436440	has flared up anew in the modern philosophy of mathematics. The issue is clearer now than of old
2436440	2443800	because we now have a more explicit standard whereby to decide what ontology a given theory
2443800	2454120	or form of discourse is committed to. A theory is committed to those and only those entities to which
2454120	2462120	the bound variables of the theory must be capable of referring in order that the affirmations made
2462120	2472120	in the theory be true. Because this standard of ontological presupposition did not emerge clearly
2472120	2478680	in the philosophical tradition, the modern philosophical mathematicians have not on the whole
2478680	2485720	recognized that they were debating the same old problem of universals in a newly clarified form.
2486840	2494040	But the fundamental cleavages among modern points of view on foundations of mathematics
2494040	2500600	do come down pretty explicitly to disagreements as to the range of entities to which the bound
2500680	2509080	variables should be permitted to refer. The three main medieval points of view regarding
2509080	2519800	universals are designated by historians as realism, conceptualism, and nominalism. Essentially,
2520440	2528280	these same three doctrines reappear in 20th century surveys of the philosophy of mathematics
2528280	2534200	under the new names, logicism, intuitionism, and formalism.
2536440	2542120	Realism, as the word is used in connection with the medieval controversy over universals,
2543000	2552840	is the platonic doctrine that universals or abstract entities have being independently of the mind.
2553800	2563880	The mind may discover them but cannot create them. Logicism, represented by Frege, Russell,
2563880	2572360	Whitehead, Church, and Carnap condones the use of bound variables to refer to abstract entities
2572360	2577960	known and unknown, specifiable and unspecifiable indiscriminately.
2577960	2589880	Conceptualism holds that there are universals but they are mind-made. Intuitionism, espoused in
2589880	2599880	modern times in one form or another by Poincaré, Brower, Veil, and others, countenances the use
2599880	2608920	of bound variables to refer to abstract entities only when those entities are capable of being
2608920	2616920	cooked up individually from ingredients specified in advance. As Frankel has put it,
2617800	2625960	logicism holds that classes are discovered while intuitionism holds that they are invented.
2626840	2632680	A fair statement indeed of the old opposition between realism and conceptualism.
2634520	2642440	This opposition is no mere quibble. It makes an essential difference in the amount of classical
2642440	2652440	mathematics to which one is willing to subscribe. Logicists or realists are able on their assumptions
2652520	2660760	to get Cantor's ascending orders of infinity. Intuitionists are compelled to stop with the
2660760	2668360	lowest order of infinity and as an indirect consequence to abandon even some of the classical
2668360	2677960	laws of real numbers. The modern controversy between logicism and intuitionism arose, in fact,
2677960	2687720	from disagreements over infinity. Formalism, associated with the name of Hilbert, echoes
2687720	2695320	intuitionism in deploring the logicist unbridled recourse to universals. But
2695960	2705320	formalism also finds intuitionism unsatisfactory. This could happen for either of two opposite
2705320	2713400	reasons. The formalist might, like the logicist, object to the crippling of classical mathematics.
2714280	2722440	Or he might, like the nominalists of old, object to admitting abstract entities at all,
2723400	2732200	even in the restrained sense of mind-made entities. The upshot is the same. The formalist
2732200	2739960	keeps classical mathematics as a play of insignificant notations. This play of notations
2739960	2746760	can still be of utility, whatever utility it has already shown itself to have as a crutch
2746760	2755640	for physicists and technologists. But utility need not imply significance in any literal
2755640	2763320	linguistic sense. Nor need the marked success of mathematicians in spinning out theorems,
2763320	2769480	and in finding objective basis for agreement with one another's results, imply significance.
2770600	2777480	For an adequate basis for agreement among mathematicians can be found simply in the rules
2777480	2785320	which govern the manipulation of the notations. These syntactical rules being, unlike the
2785320	2793720	notations themselves, quite significant and intelligible. I have argued that the sort of
2793720	2801320	ontology we adopt can be consequential, notably in connection with mathematics, although this
2801320	2811720	is only an example. Now, how are we to adjudicate among rival ontologies? Certainly, the answer
2811720	2818520	is not provided by the semantical formula to be is to be the value of a variable.
2819640	2826600	This formula serves, rather conversely, in testing the conformity of a given remark
2826600	2835160	or doctrine to a prior ontological standard. We look to bound variables in connection with ontology,
2835800	2843080	not in order to know what there is, but in order to know what a given remark or doctrine,
2843720	2853480	ours or someone else's, says there is. And this much is quite properly a problem involving language,
2854360	2863240	but what there is is another question. In debating over what there is, there are still
2863240	2870760	reasons for operating on a semantical plane. One reason is to escape from the predicament
2870760	2877640	noted at the beginning of this essay, the predicament of my not being able to admit
2877640	2887080	that there are things which MacX countenances and I do not. So long as I adhere to my ontology,
2887080	2895320	as opposed to MacX's, I cannot allow my bound variables to refer to entities which belong
2895320	2904680	to MacX's ontology and not to mine. I can, however, consistently describe our disagreement
2905240	2912520	by characterizing the statements which MacX affirms, provided merely that my ontology
2912520	2918760	countenances linguistic forms, or at least concrete inscriptions and utterances,
2919560	2926840	I can talk about MacX's sentences. Another reason for withdrawing to a semantical plane
2927400	2936360	is to find common ground on which to argue. Disagreement in ontology involves basic disagreement
2936360	2942920	in conceptual schemes, yet MacX and I, despite these basic disagreements,
2943720	2950360	find that our conceptual schemes converge sufficiently in their intermediate and upper
2950360	2957480	ramifications to enable us to communicate successfully on topics such as politics,
2958040	2967560	weather, and, in particular, language. Insofar as our basic controversy over ontology
2967560	2973720	can be translated upward into a semantical controversy about words and what to do with them,
2974360	2979480	the collapse of the controversy into question begging may be delayed.
2979960	2986920	It is no wonder, then, that ontological controversy should tend into controversy over
2986920	2997000	language, but we must not jump to the conclusion that what there is depends on words. Translate
2997000	3004600	ability of a question into semantical terms is no indication that the question is linguistic.
3004680	3012520	To see Naples is to bear a name which, when prefixed to the words C's Naples,
3012520	3020520	yields a true sentence. Still, there is nothing linguistic about seeing Naples.
3022680	3031320	Our acceptance of an ontology is, I think, similar in principle to our acceptance of a
3032040	3041960	scientific theory, say a system of physics. We adopt, at least insofar as we are reasonable,
3042600	3049080	the simplest conceptual scheme into which the disordered fragments of raw experience
3049080	3057640	can be fitted and arranged. Our ontology is determined once we have fixed upon the
3057640	3063320	overall conceptual scheme which is to accommodate science in the broadest sense,
3064200	3069960	and the considerations which determine a reasonable construction of any part of that
3069960	3077640	conceptual scheme, for example, the biological or the physical part, are not different in kind
3077640	3082680	from the considerations which determine a reasonable construction of the whole.
3083320	3089960	To whatever extent the adoption of any system of scientific theory may be said to be a matter
3089960	3097240	of language, the same, but no more, may be said of the adoption of an ontology.
3099160	3106680	But simplicity as a guiding principle in constructing conceptual schemes is not a clear
3106840	3117640	and unambiguous idea, and it is quite capable of presenting a double or multiple standard.
3119080	3126680	Imagine, for example, that we have devised the most economical set of concepts adequate to the
3126680	3135720	play-by-play reporting of immediate experience. The entities under this scheme, the values of
3135720	3144680	bound variables, are, let us suppose, individual subjective events of sensation or reflection.
3145960	3154040	We should still find, no doubt, that a physicalistic conceptual scheme purporting to talk about
3154040	3160520	external objects offers great advantages in simplifying our overall reports.
3161960	3168280	By bringing together scattered sense events and treating them as perceptions of one object,
3169080	3176040	we reduce the complexity of our stream of experience to a manageable conceptual simplicity.
3176440	3183400	The rule of simplicity is indeed our guiding maxim in assigning sense data to objects.
3184280	3190680	We associate an earlier and a later round-sensum with the same so-called penny,
3191320	3198440	or with two different so-called pennies, in obedience to the demands of maximum simplicity
3198840	3200680	in our total world picture.
3201400	3214040	Here we have two competing conceptual schemes, a phenomenalistic one and a physicalistic one,
3215320	3224040	which should prevail. Each has its advantages. Each has its special simplicity in its own way.
3224040	3233000	Each, I suggest, deserves to be developed. Each may be said, indeed, to be the more fundamental,
3233720	3242280	though in different senses. The one is epistemologically, the other physically fundamental.
3244600	3251400	The physical conceptual scheme simplifies our account of experience because of the way
3251400	3257240	myriad scattered sense events come to be associated with single so-called objects.
3258360	3265240	Still, there is no likelihood that each sentence about physical objects can actually be translated,
3265800	3271320	however deviously and complexly, into the phenomenalistic language.
3272280	3281160	Physical objects are postulated entities, which round out and simplify our account of the flux
3281160	3288920	of experience, just as the introduction of irrational numbers simplifies laws of arithmetic.
3291000	3296520	From the point of view of the conceptual scheme of the elementary arithmetic of
3296600	3303400	rational numbers alone, the broader arithmetic of rational and irrational numbers would have
3303400	3310840	the status of a convenient myth, simpler than the literal truth, namely the arithmetic of
3310840	3320120	rationals, and yet containing that literal truth as a scattered part. Similarly, from a
3320120	3327080	phenomenalistic point of view, the conceptual scheme of physical objects is a convenient myth,
3328040	3334280	simpler than the literal truth and yet containing that literal truth as a scattered part.
3335960	3341320	Now, what of classes or attributes of physical objects, in turn?
3342280	3349960	A Platonistic ontology of this sort is, from the point of view of a strictly physicalistic
3349960	3358840	conceptual scheme, as much a myth as that physicalistic conceptual scheme itself is for phenomenalism.
3360680	3369480	This higher myth is a good and useful one, in turn, insofar as it simplifies our account of physics.
3370440	3377560	Since mathematics is an integral part of this higher myth, the utility of this myth for physical
3377560	3385880	science is evident enough. In speaking of it nevertheless as a myth, I echo that philosophy
3385880	3395000	of mathematics to which I alluded earlier under the name of formalism. But an attitude of formalism
3395080	3402440	may with equal justice be adopted toward the physical conceptual scheme, in turn, by the pure
3402440	3411320	ascete or phenomenalist. The analogy between the myth of mathematics and the myth of physics is,
3412040	3420040	in some additional and perhaps fortuitous ways, strikingly close. Consider, for example,
3420040	3425400	the crisis which was precipitated in the foundations of mathematics at the turn of
3425400	3431640	the century by the discovery of Russell's paradox and other antinomies of set theory.
3432680	3441960	These contradictions had to be obviated by unintuitive ad hoc devices. Our mathematical
3441960	3451880	myth making became deliberate and evident to all. But what of physics? An antinomy rose between the
3451880	3458520	undular and corpuscular accounts of light, and if this was not as out and out a contradiction
3458520	3466280	as Russell's paradox, I suspect that the reason is that physics is not as out and out as mathematics.
3467240	3475640	Again, the second great modern crisis in the foundations of mathematics, precipitated in 1931
3475640	3480680	by Gertl's prove that there are bound to be undecidable statements in arithmetic,
3481320	3487480	has its companion piece in physics, in Heisenberg's indeterminancy principle.
3487640	3496680	In earlier pages, I undertook to show that some common arguments in favor of certain ontologies
3496680	3503960	are fallacious. Further, I advanced an explicit standard whereby to decide what the ontological
3503960	3511800	commitments of a theory are. But the question what ontology actually to adopt still stands open,
3512440	3516600	and the obvious counsel is tolerance and an experimental spirit.
3517720	3524280	Let us by all means see how much of the physicalistic conceptual scheme can be reduced to a
3524280	3533480	phenomenalistic one. Still, physics also naturally demands pursuing, irreducible in Toto, though it
3533480	3542200	may be. Let us see how, or to what degree, natural science may be rendered independent
3542200	3550040	of Platonistic mathematics. But let us also pursue mathematics and delve into its Platonistic
3550040	3557800	foundations. From among the various conceptual schemes best suited to these various pursuits,
3558760	3568600	one, the phenomenalistic, claims epistemological priority. Viewed from within the phenomenalistic
3568600	3576120	conceptual scheme, the ontologies of physical objects and mathematical objects are myths.
3577400	3586040	The quality of myth, however, is relative. Relative, in this case, to the epistemological
3586040	3595800	point of view. This point of view is one among various, corresponding to one among our various
3595800	3605560	interests and purposes.
