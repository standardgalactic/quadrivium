0	8000	This is a brushless motor. It is often used for creating lift and it uses three phase electricity.
8000	16000	I'm going to show you how they work and even how to control one with an Arduino in this video which is sponsored by Brilliant.org.
16000	22000	You can get a 20% discount by using the link below. More about that later.
22000	26000	A brushless DC motor looks something like this.
26000	33000	They come in various sizes and designs but they all convert electrical energy into mechanical energy.
33000	40000	We can use that mechanical rotation, for example on a drone, to spin the blades and create lift.
40000	46000	We find these motors used in PC cooling fans. This CD drive uses a brushless motor
46000	51000	and even this battery power drill also uses a brushless motor.
51000	55000	What makes this different to a standard DC motor?
55000	63000	When we compare the two, we can notice that both have magnets in the outer casing and both have coils of wire at the centre.
63000	68000	However, with a standard DC motor, we find these brushes at the rear.
68000	78000	This refers to the arms and the carbon blocks which rub against the commutator plates and allow electricity to flow through the coils while it rotates.
78000	87000	The gaps in the commutator plates cause the coils to energise and de-energise in a certain order to cause the rotation.
87000	93000	Because the brushes rub against the commutator plates, they wear down over time due to friction.
93000	96000	So the motor will need to be repaired or replaced.
96000	100000	When we look at a brushless motor, there are no brushes.
100000	106000	That's because in this design, the outer casing rotates and the coils remain stationary.
106000	113000	As there are no brushes, there is very little friction which makes the motor more efficient and it lasts longer.
113000	118000	We can also get in-runner motors where the rotor turns inside.
118000	124000	But most applications use out-runner motors where the rotor turns outside the motor.
124000	132000	In-runner motors typically rotate faster but out-runner motors have much more torque which is why they are more commonly used.
132000	136000	So we will only discuss this version in this video.
136000	145000	With a standard DC motor, we have just two wires and it rotates as soon as we connect it to a sufficient electrical supply.
145000	149000	However, a brushless motor has three wires.
149000	152000	These connect to an electronic speed controller.
152000	158000	A main controller sends signals using pulse width modulation to the speed controller.
158000	169000	The speed controller increases, maintains or decreases the speed of the motor by controlling when current can flow through the three wires and into the motor.
169000	172000	We will see how it does that later on in the video.
172000	179000	By the way, we have covered how DC motors work in detail previously and you can even learn how to build your own motor too.
179000	181000	Links down below for that.
182000	189000	When we look at the brushless motor, we notice there are three wires entering the base of the motor.
189000	193000	These are usually coloured differently to represent the different phases.
193000	199000	The base of the motor has some threaded holes which are used to mount the motor to a surface.
199000	202000	There is also a clip which holds the shaft in position.
202000	208000	The shaft runs the length of the motor and it also extends out the front of the motor.
208000	213000	We can connect attachments to this to make use of the rotation.
213000	219000	Notice when the shaft rotates, it also rotates the front half of the motor casing.
219000	223000	Therefore, this is the rotor and this part is the stator.
223000	229000	The rotor and the stator both have holes in their casing to vent heat which is generated by the coils.
229000	233000	That's because if too much heat was to build up inside,
233000	240000	it will melt the protective enamel insulation of the wires causing a short circuit which will destroy the motor.
240000	245000	If we remove the clip on the back, we can remove the shaft and the rotor to look inside.
245000	253000	Looking at the stator, we can see the shaft passes through a set of bearings to ensure a smooth low friction rotation.
253000	257000	There are 12 teeth on the stator in this design.
257000	262000	These are made of laminated thin sheets of metal which are electrically isolated from each other.
262000	266000	This is to reduce the eddy currents inside the motor.
266000	272000	These are caused by the magnetic field and waste energy by creating heat instead of rotation.
272000	278000	We can also notice that there are 12 coils of wire grouped into three different sets.
278000	282000	The wire is enameled which electrically insulates it.
282000	288000	This means the current has to pass through the entire length of the wire to reach the other end.
288000	293000	If it was not insulated, then the current would take the shortest path possible
293000	298000	and we wouldn't get a strong magnetic field so the motor wouldn't work.
298000	301000	Each set of coils connects to a different phase.
301000	303000	There are three phases in total.
303000	310000	If we look at the back of the stator, we can see the ends of each coil are joined to another set of coils.
310000	316000	The wires from the speed controller then connect to these points to provide the electrical current.
316000	322000	Notice that in this design the two adjoining coils are wrapped in opposite directions.
322000	325000	Clockwise and anticlockwise.
325000	328000	We will see why later on in this video.
328000	331000	This is the most common method for wiring a brushless motor.
331000	334000	It is known as a DL-RK winding.
334000	337000	We see it creates a delta connection.
337000	341000	There are other configurations but this is the most common.
341000	349000	Looking now inside the rotor, we find a number of high strength permanent magnets surrounding the inner surface.
349000	355000	These are actually magnetized meaning the polarity is different on either side.
355000	359000	These are arranged so that the polarity alternates with each magnet.
359000	365000	Notice that in this example there are 14 magnets but 12 stator coils.
365000	371000	So we have 12 stator poles and 14 magnetic poles which is a common design.
371000	375000	The difference prevents the magnets and coils from aligning.
375000	380000	The rotor constantly rotates by trying to align but it will be unable to.
380000	383000	Let's understand how the motor works.
383000	386000	But first where have you seen brushless motors used?
386000	391000	Let me know in the comment section down below.
391000	394000	So now let's understand how this motor works.

436000	440000	I highly recommend you check this out, links down below.
440000	447000	The brushless motor has three wires which connect onto the three sets of coils inside the motor.
447000	457000	This is also connected to a controller which sends a pulse width modulation signal to the speed controller telling it what speed to rotate the motor.
457000	463000	The signal could be sent from something like an Arduino or a simple servo tester.
463000	468000	We will learn how to control the speed of the motor with an Arduino later on in this video.
468000	473000	Speed controllers are usually a very compact design like this one.
473000	479000	But we can also get larger units like this one where you can see the components more easily.
479000	484000	The speed controller uses six MOSFETs which are a type of electronic switch.
484000	490000	The MOSFET will block the flow of current unless we provide a voltage to the control pin.
490000	494000	This then closes the switch and allows current to flow through it.
494000	499000	The MOSFETs are grouped into three pairs, one pair for each phase.
499000	503000	These are connected across the positive and the ground of the battery.
503000	511000	The pulse width modulation signal is received by the internal controller which controls the MOSFETs, turning them on and off.
511000	516000	The coils inside the stator then connect to the phases between the MOSFETs.
516000	526000	The motor uses coils of wire because when we pass a current through the coil it generates an electromagnetic field which we can see with a compass.
526000	536000	We can reverse the polarity by simply reversing the direction of current or we can change the orientation of the coil.
536000	544000	Notice the coils in the motor are in opposite directions. This creates opposite polarities making the motor stronger.
544000	550000	We know that magnets interact by pushing and pulling. We can use them to cause rotation.
550000	555000	We can control the coils to precisely control the rotation also.
555000	565000	So if we energize a phase it will push and pull the magnets in the rotor at multiple points causing rotation and giving us a very powerful motor.
565000	572000	The controller receives a pulse width modulation signal. This means voltage is sent in pulses down the wire.
572000	579000	The width of the pulse can be varied. This is similar to when we press a switch to turn a light on.
579000	589000	The longer we press the switch the longer the pulse will be. These pulses are sent every 20 milliseconds so it sends them 50 times per second.
589000	593000	We can see the pulse by connecting the device to an oscilloscope.
593000	601000	If I zoom in we can see the width of the pulse there is as I turn the dial which is why it's called pulse width modulation.
601000	608000	If I change the voltage we see the pulse becomes a higher voltage but it doesn't change the width of the pulse.
608000	617000	The internal controller receives these pulses and will open and close the MOSFETs in a certain order to energize the coils in the stator.
617000	627000	The speed it does this depends on the width of the pulse received. This causes a rotating electromagnetic field which occurs in six stages.
627000	637000	There are only three sets of coils so the direction of current reverses each time it is energised and so the polarity also alternates.
637000	642000	The faster the MOSFETs open and close the faster the rotation will be.
642000	649000	We can see using this oscilloscope that as the width of the pulse increases the motor turns faster.
649000	656000	So the width of the pulse determines the speed the MOSFETs turn on and off which changes the speed of the motor.
656000	660000	The speed controller needs to know the orientation of the motor.
660000	672000	Some motors use a Hall Effect Sensor which detects the change in polarity of the magnets and from this it generates a unique pattern which the controller can map the rotor position from.
672000	682000	However most hobby motors like this one do not use Hall Effect Sensors. Instead the speed controller measures the back EMF.
682000	690000	We know that when we pass a current through a coil it generates an electromagnetic field which can move another magnet.
690000	696000	But equally if we move a magnet past a coil the coil will generate a voltage.
696000	701000	The speed controller does not energize all the coils at the same time.
701000	709000	When the magnets move past a non-energized coil it induces a voltage in that coil which is sent back to the controller.
709000	712000	We call this back EMF.
712000	719000	So the speed controller monitors the coils for when it is supplied electricity or generates electricity.
719000	724000	From this it creates a unique pattern and determines the position of the rotor.
724000	733000	When you start the motor it makes some noises and rotates small amounts. This is to determine the orientation.
733000	741000	So let's now build this circuit and learn how to control a brushless motor with an Arduino.
741000	747000	We are going to learn how to control a brushless motor with an Arduino and a potentiometer.
747000	756000	For that we need an Arduino, a brushless motor, a potentiometer, a speed controller, a power supply and some wires.
756000	760000	Next we need to connect the brushless motor to the speed controller.
760000	766000	Then connect the white signal wire of the speed controller to port 9 of the Arduino.
766000	772000	The Arduino will send a pulse width modulation signal to the speed controller through this wire.
772000	777000	Then connect the red wire from the speed controller to the positive rail of the breadboard.
777000	780000	This will provide around 5 volts to the breadboard.
780000	785000	Then connect a red wire from the positive rail to the 5 volt port of the Arduino.
785000	787000	This will power the Arduino.
787000	793000	Then connect a black wire from the Arduino ground port to the ground rail of the breadboard.
793000	799000	Then connect a black wire from the ground rail to the speed controller ground port.
799000	802000	Next we will need to connect the potentiometer.
802000	808000	So we connect the left side to the positive rail and then the right side to the negative rail.
808000	813000	Finally we connect the center pin to port A0 of the Arduino.
813000	818000	Now connect your Arduino to the computer to start writing the program.
818000	822000	You can download my Arduino code for free, links down below for that.
822000	824000	Then we type this code.
824000	829000	This tells the Arduino to use the pre-built servo instruction library.
829000	834000	A servo is a different type of motor but it will work fine for this project.
834000	839000	If you want to learn how that motor works you can find a link in the video description down below.
839000	844000	Then we type this which creates an object called ESC.
844000	847000	Although you can call it whatever you wish.
847000	852000	Then we type this line of code which creates a variable integer called speed.
852000	860000	Then we type this line of code which tells the Arduino that the object called ESC is connected to pin 9.
860000	865000	It will send a pulse width modulation signal out of pin 9.
865000	870000	The pulses will be between 1ms and 2ms in length.
870000	877000	The motor will still rotate without this last part but the motor will stall when the potentiometer is at its maximum.
877000	880000	So we will include this in the code.
880000	882000	Then we type this.
882000	891000	This takes a voltage reading from the potentiometer on port A0 and it associates this with a variable we created called speed.
891000	897000	We are sending 5 volts through the potentiometer and reading the voltage we get back from this
897000	901000	which varies depending on the position of the potentiometer.
901000	908000	The Arduino receives this and converts the voltage into a number between 0 and 1023.
908000	912000	When it receives 5 volts it is 1023.
912000	914000	When it is 0 volts it is 0.
914000	918000	The servo library we are using doesn't understand these numbers.
918000	922000	It only understands values between 0 and 180.
922000	926000	So we are creating a scale here to convert between them.
926000	934000	Then the final part of the code takes this value and sends it as a pulse width modulation signal to the speed controller.
934000	942000	So we send this code to the Arduino, then we disconnect the USB cable and connect the power supply to the speed controller.
942000	952000	The motor will create a few beeps as it configures itself and then after a short while we can start to control the speed of the motor using the potentiometer.
952000	960000	Check out one of these videos on screen now to continue learning about electronics engineering and I'll catch you there for the next lesson.
