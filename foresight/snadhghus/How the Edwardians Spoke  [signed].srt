1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,080
Our understanding of Edwardian Britain is dominated by images.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,280
We can see it in flickering footage of the time, in formal family portraits.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,680
But apart from a few famous voices, the people themselves remain silent.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,040
We can see the Edwardians, but we can't hear them.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,360
But there has been a remarkable discovery which for the first time gives voice to our ancestors.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,960
And it has come from the most unlikely place, Germany.

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,200
There were a man and had two sons.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,280
Hundreds of recordings have come to light which reveal the voices of British prisoners from the First World War.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:01:09,360
I'm going to return to the hometowns of these men and meet their families.

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,800
How does it feel to hear one of your relatives speaking to you from nearly a century ago?

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:27,360
And how much of all our voices changed since Edwardian times?

12
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,720
What do you think the placement of a Geordiac accent is? Where it's formed in the mouth? What the mouth shapes like?

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,240
Well, to be honest, I wouldn't know. The thing that strikes me about a Geordiac accent is the tune of it.

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,640
It goes up at the end of the sentences.

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,720
But I have to say, for someone like me, Geordia's probably the most difficult accent.

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,960
I have an unusual job. I teach accents for a living. I teach accents to actors for theatre, television, films.

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,120
In the time I've been teaching, I've taught over 350 accents.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,880
It can end on an op, it can end on a don, it can end wherever you like.

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,040
But it's got to have that direction about going over the wheeere of the North Sea in order to get there.

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,400
Right, right.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,840
And I think, too, that there's much more variety of tune in a new castle accent, don't you?

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,040
Than in most other accents. I mean, you'd get a thing that a lot of the lads are speaking really low down.

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,400
But there are a huge number of the women that actually can move about an octave within a sentence.

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,440
Try saying to me, Jim Court, this is a long one to remember.

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,760
Jim Court, six fish, we are stuck at the weekend. Keep going over the top.

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,360
At the weekend. Exactly. So you've got that glottal going with a K at the weekend with Jackie.

27
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Right. And that helps you enormously, doesn't it?

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,960
Jackie. Yes, OK.

29
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,720
Jim Court, six fish at the weekend with Jackie.

30
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,040
Good.

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,440
The British Isles has a rich tapestry of different accents.

32
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,880
Over the years, I've come to feel connections between the way we speak and the scenery that surrounds us.

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,520
It seems to me that landscape dictates or has something to do with the tune of an accent.

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,480
It certainly feels true that the flatter a landscape, the flatter the accent,

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,000
the area of East Anglia being a perfect example, which is probably the flattest counter geographically

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,600
and has the flattest accent. So there's a feeling like in East Anglia, you take a few steps forward,

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,360
little step back, another little step forward, and it stays very much on like two or three notes,

38
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,920
which could contrast very clearly with somewhere like South Wales,

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
the hills and valleys where we're traveling from the valley over the top of the hillside

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
onto the other side. And so there's a feeling of expansiveness.

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,320
One of the most interesting factors in accents to me is whether the tune is in major or minor key.

42
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,560
Good examples of that to make that clear would be Birmingham, which is absolutely in minor key.

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,760
So I could go on and on in where I like, but never ever end on a definite note.

44
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,560
So you hear that sort of dull minor key ending as opposed to something like North Yorkshire,

45
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,320
where I'm ending up very, very much on definite notes and I'm bound to sound more sure of myself.

46
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,280
A career of listening to voices has taught me how quickly accent and dialect,

47
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,880
the particular words local to each region, change over time.

48
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,440
To find out how people used to speak in the past, I'm dependent on old recordings

49
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,520
and the further back I go, the fewer there are. Sound recording was in its infancy in the Edwardian

50
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,480
era, and so was reserved for the great and the good. This is what makes the discovery of recordings

51
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,240
of ordinary soldiers from World War I so remarkable.

52
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,320
I've come to Berlin to find out more about these recordings of British prisoners of war.

53
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,720
Just four years ago, author John Adams came across them by chance while researching local dialect.

54
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,240
I first came across these recordings through a book in the British Library.

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,760
This book was called Cheshire Montart, Cheshire dialect. It was published in 1938,

56
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,720
and it referred back to recordings made of prisoners of war during the First World War.

57
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,160
These recordings were said to be in Berlin, so I wrote to the Humboldt University and asked them

58
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,480
if the recording still existed. I got a marvellous reply back. If I told them what I wanted,

59
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,200
they would send them to me. So I phoned up the British Library Sound Archive and said,

60
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,120
were they aware that these recordings existed? And they said no, and if they did exist,

61
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,640
they were of national importance.

62
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,680
Miraculously, these fragile records made from a brittle resin called shellac

63
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,720
survived the devastation of Berlin during the Second World War, and are still there today.

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,480
Hidden away in a corner of the city stands the archive which holds the recordings,

65
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,960
overseen by sound and music expert Jürgen Marenholds. He has dedicated the last eight years

66
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,760
to a meticulous process of cataloging and filing.

67
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,360
How many First World War recordings do you have here?

68
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:56,240
Oh, we have 1,650 shellac recordings here in our archive.

69
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,600
And how many British prisoners of war does that include?

70
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,680
I think we have 200 recordings on shellac discs.

71
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,240
So if I said a county to you, you could just pick something out of the cabinet?

72
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes, for example, we have...

73
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,960
If I said Dorset.

74
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,480
Yes, Dorset, for example. The code number is 467.

75
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,080
Yes.

76
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,400
So this is it. This is the first one I see.

77
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,120
So this is a recording of Dorset. What does that say?

78
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,840
It's also South of Dorset.

79
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:53,040
And the recording is of, written in hand writing, the recording is of the farmer's daughter.

80
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,640
The farmer's daughter, is that right?

81
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,760
Yes, it's right. And the code number is PK467.

82
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,680
The recordings were masterminded by two men.

83
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,200
Alois Brandl was an Austrian academic fascinated by British accents and dialects,

84
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:17,200
whose research trips to this country have been brought to an abrupt end by the outbreak of war.

85
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Wilhelm Durgen was a sound specialist, whose dream was to create a museum of languages and music from around the world.

86
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:37,040
In the first few months of the war, several thousand British soldiers were captured and taken prisoner in Germany.

87
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,800
They were held in dozens of camps stretching across the country.

88
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,880
As the war raged, Durgen realized that on his doorstep was a captive resource.

89
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:56,080
These camps offered him a unique opportunity to record the speech and music of many different nationalities.

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,400
Seizing his chance, Durgen put forward his plan to make recordings of the prisoners to the German authorities.

91
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:10,640
The Germans would have been very keen to exploit the resource of all these prisoners of different nationalities who had effectively landed on their doorstep.

92
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,600
They would have had access to a huge range of ethnic groups of languages and of cultural traditions,

93
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,440
which would have made it very interesting for ethnographers, musical historians, linguists.

94
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,760
Permission was granted.

95
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,840
Between 1915 and 1918, Brandl and Durgen formed part of a team of academics who chored over 70 prisoner of war camps,

96
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,120
recording around 250 languages and dialects.

97
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:50,320
For Brandl, this was the perfect opportunity to study his favorite subject, British accents and dialects.

98
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,480
For the prisoners of war, however, life in the camps was harsh.

99
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,200
The physical surroundings of camps varied greatly.

100
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,360
For the ordinary soldiers, they were often not unlike in perhaps some of the camps that they'd experienced at home in the British Army,

101
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,880
but they were often of a far inferior standard, usually hutted accommodation, possibly with up to 20 or 30 men in each hut.

102
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
They'd be very, very cold in the winter and German winters can be extremely cold,

103
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,280
and these men didn't have access to warm winter clothing in many cases, or they'd lost their warm winter clothing during their capture.

104
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,600
So they would be wired in, they would be sentries, and in some cases there would also be dogs patrolling the outer perimeter.

105
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,160
So it was an extremely oppressive and very unpleasant place to be incarcerated.

106
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,320
For three years, Brandl and Durgen devoted all their time to this ambitious project.

107
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,160
Travelling from camp to camp, they recorded one prisoner after another,

108
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,000
building up a vast archive of voices and keeping detailed written records of each speaker.

109
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,520
It's fantastic to see this at last, and I really can't wait to hear it. Can you play it for me?

110
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh yes, I can do.

111
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Oh, that's a recording of Sidney Wilkins.

112
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,000
But how can you know the speed at which to play it?

113
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:24,720
The last groove here has an A, and I can control this A with our tune fork here.

114
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,240
And when the speed of the recording is right, I have the same tune from this record.

115
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
And now the...

116
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,160
So now you're adjusting the speed down here. Yes, there's the pitch control.

117
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,200
And now you're here, it's the same tune, and now the record is ready for...

118
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
So can we hear Sidney? Yes, now we can hear the real voice.

119
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,760
He's all the farmer's daughters, the beautiful I'm told, whose parents died in laughter,

120
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,160
five hundred pounds in gold. Her uncle kept a plow boy, who Mary loved so well.

121
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,920
And in her uncle's garden, the tales of love would tell.

122
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,600
There were a wealthy squire who all came here to see,

123
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,440
but still she loved her plow boy on the banks of the sweet Dundee.

124
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,720
What do you think about this recording?

125
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,400
That's amazing. I mean, I don't know what Sidney would think about us listening to this now.

126
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,160
If I listen to his recording, I mean, if I do it from my clinical more scientific side,

127
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,680
if I listen to that recording and you asked me where he came from in England,

128
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,960
I don't think I would guess Dorset. I thought I would guess somewhere deeper into the West

129
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:58,160
country, because he sounds almost like Somerset nowadays. These sounds he makes,

130
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:06,000
like Zummer and Varmer, these F-stavies and S-zeds really belong deeper into the West country.

131
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,040
The text most frequently recorded was the parable of the prodigal son,

132
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,960
but the prisoners also recited poems, told local stories and sang songs.

133
00:13:45,040 --> 00:14:04,240
What do you think about that?

134
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,880
I just, I'm very emotional.

135
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,120
Very emotional, because it's just, it's a very typical Scottish song and it's about the songs

136
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:25,760
about longing. And it just touches me about longing from home. You just hear the yearning

137
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,640
in the voice and it sounds exactly, the accent sounds exactly as you'd hear some of that area now.

138
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,760
The recordings had an educational purpose to document for the German nation the speech

139
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,560
and music of the rest of the world, but was there a greater plan in mind?

140
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,400
How did they get the finances? Because particularly at that time during the war,

141
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,400
there wasn't a lot of spare money around, presumably. Yes, the first two years are

142
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:04,720
spent by the German government. Really? Yes, because this was a colonial area of Germany too

143
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:14,000
and they thought at the beginning of the First World War that they do not lost this

144
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,200
world war. Oh, so they thought that they were going to come to all these places and pass

145
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,680
themselves off as native speakers of Dorset. So this is the devious plan. When they have

146
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,240
the good recordings, they can train all the people who go to the new colonies.

147
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,920
Do you, do you, do you surmise that? Do you guess that or do you know that?

148
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,240
I know that because it was the purpose of Willem Durgen and that is written down

149
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,640
in some readings that this was also to train, well, this recordings were also made to train

150
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,840
the person who go to the, to the colonies or to parts of England.

151
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,280
There was a man who had two sons, the youngest of them said to his father.

152
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,840
PK737 was the recording by Philip Jarvis of the prodigal son in March 1917.

153
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,680
We know that Philip was born in Macclesfield in Cheshire,

154
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:32,320
but few other details are known about him and no photographs have survived.

155
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:44,720
I've come to Macclesfield to meet Philip's family. I don't really know this area so first I'm keen

156
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:58,640
to get a feel for the local accent. When I'm studying an accent, I try my best to get into the

157
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,720
heart of the place and sensibility behind the people as well as just the sound.

158
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,560
I stand at bus stops, I queue in the post office, I go into pubs, I go into community centres.

159
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:26,320
When I come into bars, I often have a tape recorder hidden in a pocket. It's not always

160
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:34,480
feasible to do that. So I usually find myself a quiet corner, listen to people, and I write down

161
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:43,680
phonetically what I'm hearing. Everybody's talking about the darts, boo-wood. This is my favourite

162
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:53,680
diphthong. So I can write that down phonetically. So I see my diphthong here is ua, like in sewer,

163
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,520
but which we'd never expect in this context of boo-wood. So at least I've learned how to say

164
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:08,000
the dart, boo-wood. Philip Jarvis grew up in a gamekeeper's lodge in the countryside, so I want

165
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,720
to get into the heart of the rural community to hear how that accent sounds today. I love coming

166
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,800
places like this when I'm researching an accent. I'm full of anticipation, full of excitement

167
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,080
about what I'll find. I've never been to Macclesfield before, so I have an idea of what the accent's

168
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,080
going to be like. I hope it's going to be my expectation, so that it's going to be a very

169
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,640
physical, grounded sound.

170
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:52,800
I suspect that members of the farming community hold on to the accent far more and hold on to

171
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:59,040
the dialect more. They recognise the dialect for words. Because they're a community, because they

172
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,880
don't see as many people outside their own working environment.

173
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:23,040
This is Bianca. This is Bianca, the cow. Yes, Baynaud. So you've spent a long time cleaning her up,

174
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:31,280
haven't you? And are you a farmer? One's been a farmer, yes. I go out to work full time as well.

175
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Did you buy any cows today? No, sold two. And how much do you get for them?

176
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,560
Nearly a thousand for one and seven hundred and something for the other one. And have you been

177
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,480
selling as well, mate? No, I've just come to look for some straw, that's all. How much do you pay for

178
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:02,960
straw? Too much, yeah, between £40 and £50 depending on whether it's barley or wheat.

179
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,000
I've had a fantastic morning here, really, because there's such a sense of community

180
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,040
amongst the farmers. And I really feel that the accent is possibly much less changed in a group

181
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,840
like this. Perhaps because farmers' children spend more time with their parents and are actually

182
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:34,160
obliged, really, to work with them, the accent carries on along with a lot of the other traditions.

183
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:58,080
I'm about a mile from where Philip Jarvis grew up at Alderley Edge. He spent the first 25 years

184
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,840
of his life here and his father was a gamekeeper, so he was very much part of this land. He also

185
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,000
came back here after the war. I've never been here before, but if I'd made a guess on listening to

186
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,920
the recording, I would have guessed that it was a place with a lot of openness of space,

187
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,480
because you can feel space around it. You can hear it in the quality of the tone,

188
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,960
that the tone quality is very open. It's not nasal at all, like Manchester, where you hear

189
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,400
the nasality of Manchester being just over there, you hear that sort of whiny quality. Whereas in

190
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,840
this part of Cheshire, the tunes are very down to earth. You can't imagine an accent from an area

191
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,480
like this being lazy in any way. This is organised, beautiful, so I've got a lot of better bits of

192
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,800
butter. That very firm, grounded tea seems to fit with it. And these incredibly rich diphthongs,

193
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,040
it wouldn't make sense to me that somebody said they looked at something for hours and hours.

194
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,960
They look at it for hours and hours and hours.

195
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:19,040
I've come to meet the Jarvis family, who lived just three miles from where Philip was born.

196
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:28,240
So you're all related in some way to Philip Jarvis, and Michael, you're the closest relation?

197
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,560
Yes, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, and Philip's father were brothers.

198
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,400
And he didn't marry himself? No, I believe Philip was a bachelor. There seemed to be

199
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,080
a few lost years from when he came out of the army, when he got demobbed in 1919.

200
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,160
There's quite a few lost years too when he died. But you know nothing about him at all?

201
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,000
Not from that time. He was a blood-reality fly, you know, and he probably had it rough in the

202
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,840
in the prisoner-war camp, and he went through a lot. A lot of people don't actually realise what

203
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,760
them poor souls went through. He was in service, what they used to call service, and then in the army,

204
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,160
and he doesn't know what a family life is, and we do appreciate what we've got.

205
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,960
And you're a very close family, aren't you? I'm a family now. This is my wife, Marion,

206
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:27,200
with son Darren, Nicola, granddaughter Jordan, have two more children, nine grandchildren,

207
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,880
and it's just one big, one big happy family. Well, there's one other thing that we do know

208
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,520
about him. We know what he sounded like. Yes. So would you like to... Oh, definitely.

209
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:49,680
There was a man who had two sons. The youngest of them said to his father,

210
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,760
give me that part of your thing that belongs to me. So father, give him his share. Not many days

211
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,920
after, the young man saw the door of his belonging together and went away into a far country.

212
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:11,040
There he wasted all that he had. When he had spent everything, a great famine came out of

213
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:19,040
country, and he'd begun to be in warmth. High time, is it that I should go back to my father?

214
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,360
This day, I would start for warmth, and I would go to my father and say to him,

215
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,000
father, I'll stand against heaven and against thee.

216
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,720
Well, I know what you're all recording sounds right, do that though, do I?

217
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,440
You think he sounds very frightened when he's making it, I mean...

218
00:24:47,680 --> 00:25:00,400
It's the old word. His mum and his father, you know, his mum like, you know, but it was...

219
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,720
Oh dear, it is very, very... Very emotional, it sounds frightened.

220
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,040
How did you feel about listening to Philip's voice for the first time, Nicola?

221
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,000
I kind of found it quite harrowing, just thinking that, you know, he's the same kind of age as

222
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,840
what I am now, and listening to the circumstances he's in there and...

223
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,960
He sounded a lot older than what he is to me. Yeah, he did sound older, I just found it really...

224
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,000
To me, he sounds a lot older than 30s, because you can hear guys, the older guys around here,

225
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,560
and some of them, they still speak like that, it's unbelievable.

226
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,240
So does he sound quite country to you? Yes, he does, yeah.

227
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,080
Because there's a couple of farmers that used to go in a local pub and they would speak like that,

228
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,320
he's just like listening to them again. Is there anything that surprises you about the

229
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,200
accent at that time that you wouldn't hear now? He's a lot stronger.

230
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,600
When I arrived here, I had this memory of Philip's voice in my head, and this idea that it's so

231
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,440
seem to fit the countryside, where you see, I mean, everything's very beautiful and neat here,

232
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,640
isn't it? But I suspect that accents have got a bit more, I don't like the term lazy,

233
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:21,920
but a bit more slap happy. How would you say the word H-E-R-E? H-E-R-E, here.

234
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,080
Darren, how would you say the word here? Here. And what would you say, Nicola? Say here.

235
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
What would you say, Jordan? Here. Right, you speak like your mummy, of course you do.

236
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,720
So there's a very big movement in Vile's sound. So here is two sounds, isn't it? Here.

237
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,160
And yours has become one sound here. Yes, you do. Yes, you're...

238
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,240
Yeah, I say all over here. Yeah, come over here.

239
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,880
I think, Nicola, that you have quite a lot of Mancunian in your accent. Would that surprise

240
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,120
you to hear that? It does really, yeah. Like I say, I've never really... I don't think I've got any

241
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,640
accent. My impression of the Macclesfield sound is that it's very down to earth, and your tunes are

242
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,200
much more sort of floaty, that they don't actually end somewhere definite. Got our nasal problem.

243
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,120
But you sound as if you have more of a Mancunian sort of tone of voice, which is not a criticism in

244
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,560
any sort of way. It's just a comment. Try and get down there every other week to go primal.

245
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:42,080
It's very different reading about somebody and reading the facts and figures and hearing somebody's

246
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:50,240
voice. I feel as if Philips with us in this room now. Yeah, I hope he is. I hope he is, and then he

247
00:27:50,240 --> 00:28:00,480
knows that we've heard him, because I'm sure when he was reading the story, wondering if anybody's

248
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,720
ever going to hear this. Is anyone going to listen to it? And 90 years on, we've listened to it.

249
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,760
What do you think about him telling the story of the prodigal son? I would think it's marvellous,

250
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,000
really, and how we feel now. The prodigal son's come back. His next birthday will raise a glass to him.

251
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:29,760
I can't help wondering what some of the prisoners felt like when they were making these recordings.

252
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:41,280
Some of them sound frightened, hesitant, nervous. I think they must have been rather

253
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:47,840
suspicious about what the recordings were for. This is the only photograph that exists of a

254
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,440
recording being made. Brandl is standing in front of the speaker, and the other prisoners are

255
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,920
awaiting their turn. The text is being held up by Durgan, who has one hand firmly behind the

256
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:07,600
prisoner's head, directing his voice towards the trumpet. Brandl, who oversaw the recordings,

257
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,760
as Quotidus is saying, this is the work of peacetime. We will not talk about the war.

258
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,480
Nothing will happen to you if you are unwilling to speak. Well, that's reassuring.

259
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:31,840
He also says, we sought out the farmer's lads from isolated farms, the fishermen from tiny harbours,

260
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,880
the shepherds, and above all, all those who are almost unable to read or write.

261
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,080
Local dialect in the strict sense of the word is restricted to those of low intelligence,

262
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:53,360
and is consequently deficient in intellectual content. That's a fave judgmental thing to say,

263
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,840
isn't it? Brandl may have had a questionable attitude towards his subjects, but he was

264
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,080
passionate in his desire to chart accents and dialects across the British Isles.

265
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,160
He was part of a pioneering group of academics working in this new world of phonetics.

266
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,640
The British linguist Henry Sweet worked with Brandl. A founder of modern phonetics, Sweet

267
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,480
is thought to have been one of the models for Henry Higgins, the professor in Pygmalion.

268
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,400
Brandl's fascination with this country also brought him into contact with one of our most famous

269
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:34,320
writers. Brandl, in his travels investigating accents, had a connection with Thomas Hardy,

270
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,240
and actually he sent some of his students to meet with him and remarked in his book on how helpful

271
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Thomas Hardy had been with them. Thomas Hardy's writing was steeped in the language and traditions

272
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:57,120
of the countryside. He had a passionate love of the West Country, and his writing made heroes and

273
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:09,680
heroines of ordinary country folk. One of the strongest rural accents I've heard amongst these

274
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:18,640
recordings comes from Wiltshire. Charlie Shears was recorded in May 1916, aged 24.

275
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:38,800
This is Cricklade in Wiltshire where Charlie Shears was born, grew up and returned to after the war.

276
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,440
Charlie loved it here. He was a farmer, and he felt at one with the landscape.

277
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,720
Charlie's gentle, rural burr reflects the undulating, rolling nature of this landscape.

278
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,240
In Charlie's time, Cricklade was at the heart of the farming community.

279
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,280
Today, with the industrial turn of Swindon just 10 minutes away, it's a commuter town.

280
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,680
Charlie's sister, aged 98, still lives nearby and remembers her brother well.

281
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,000
To your, Mrs Bartlett, your Charlie's sister, and this is your daughter Helen,

282
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Charlie's niece. Can you tell me some memories of Charlie when you...

283
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,640
Well, my mum told me that he should have been in school, but he skipped school,

284
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,360
and he lit a firework, and he threw it through the window, and it landed on one of the kids' heads,

285
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,920
burnt all his hair off. Oh my goodness.

286
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:13,520
And that is when the copper chased him and his friend, and they come to a little stream.

287
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,720
Well, they didn't have a proper bridge, they had a board like that.

288
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,160
You had a course on the board. They got over the board, the police moved me, and they went like that.

289
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,560
And what did he say to them about that?

290
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,040
Oh, he told them. He said, I've got a great respect for your parents,

291
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:40,160
but I think you two should join the army. Oh, dear. So is that why he joined the army?

292
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,200
That's right. And then Charlie joined the reserves. That's how he was called up when at first.

293
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,000
I think it was Kitchener's Army. I think that's what they called it.

294
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:57,600
And when Charlie went to war, he was captured early, early on.

295
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:07,040
Yes. And I remember my mum saying that he'd gone to Germany, but he was okay,

296
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:15,360
because he never wrote anything bad to her. And did he go with some other boys from the village?

297
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:23,520
Yes, he did go with friends. I think only him. Only Uncle Charlie came back, didn't he?

298
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,240
Yeah, he came home on my birthday. And he brought me the prettiest dress I've ever had.

299
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,720
Oh, it was lovely. And it was the church, where we went up to the church, went on the people's

300
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,920
lawn, you know, and had tea and buns and stuff. And that was my birthday.

301
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,600
I'm already thinking that Charlie tried to escape from the camp.

302
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,080
He did. He did, but they caught him. And what happened?

303
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,240
They stripped him and tied him to a tree. Well, he didn't tell us that, but his mate did.

304
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,200
He'd tell us the funny things, but he wouldn't tell us, you know, things like that.

305
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,920
He said, when they were helping the Germans pack their loads of bread for the people,

306
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,920
they had baggy trousers. When they weren't looking, they had a dozen in their electrolysis legs.

307
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,680
You don't remember your uncle at all, do you? No, only as an older man. I can't remember

308
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,560
him when I was a child. Well, he must have been about 60 when I was born, so. But I could remember

309
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,360
him being very upright, ramrod straight, you know, I suppose that was being in the army.

310
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,880
He was a lovely man, but very dry sense of humour. Do you remember Charlie's voice?

311
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:46,800
No, I don't think I can. No, I was looking at a picture of him, and I couldn't remember.

312
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,320
I couldn't. I should have remembered, but I can't.

313
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,360
As you know, we've got a recording of your brother Charlie, and I'd like to play it to you.

314
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,880
There were a man as had two sons. The younger on them said to his father,

315
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,800
give me the part of the good that belongs to me. So the father, getting his sure,

316
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,840
print many days ahead of the young man, put all his belongings together,

317
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,680
and went away to a far country. There a wife did all of that.

318
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,160
When I had spent everything, a good man had come over the country, and had begun to be in one.

319
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:33,040
A hour long, I had to check any work I could get, and I was glad when I found a flight

320
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,440
with a man of upcountry. I wouldn't have recognised it. I can't believe that.

321
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,080
It's possible he's speaking in with more dialect than he normally used, because it's very, very

322
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,640
thick. Oh my goodness, yes. With his girth, and girth, and summer. I think that's

323
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,640
more Somerset than Wiltshire. I wouldn't have recognised his voice.

324
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,080
I wouldn't have recognised his voice at all. Normally. I wouldn't.

325
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,560
No, I don't think many people speak like that. Unless you go to a village where

326
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,880
somebody's lived all their life and never moved out of the village, that's the way

327
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,560
Wiltshire people did speak. Not so much with the Zeds for summer. I can't remember that,

328
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,720
but I can remember elderly relatives talking with that strong, strong accent,

329
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,200
because they never moved away from their villages. Exactly.

330
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,160
They always lived in the same village, and everybody spoke the same.

331
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,320
It's very interesting, isn't it? I mean, I can't believe that I've actually

332
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,960
listened to him speaking in those circumstances all those years ago.

333
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,880
It just gave me a quite shiver down my spine. Yeah.

334
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,920
The recordings I've heard so far have been a revelation.

335
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,320
The accents and dialects are so much stronger than I'd expected.

336
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,680
I've come to get a second opinion from one of the country's leading experts, Johnny Robinson.

337
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:01,680
Brandl and Durgan spent a huge amount of time recording the prisoner's speech in the form of

338
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,240
phonetics. Can we just have a look at the phonetics that they wrote? Yeah.

339
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:14,240
Because although it's written in what looks like very rapid handwriting, I think we can read it

340
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,680
from the phonetics that we know today. That's right. This is fascinating text, isn't it? Because

341
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,520
this is at a time when linguists like Durgan and Brandl and people in the UK, like Henry Sweeter,

342
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,520
I believe, worked with them, were formulating a sort of national, international convention,

343
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,720
if you like, for how do we write sounds. And it's a very early version of what has become

344
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,640
the international phonetic alphabet. And so it's a fantastic early glimpse of how that came about.

345
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,720
The men who were recorded were given the text of the prodigal son and asked to change any

346
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,600
words or expressions into their local dialect. Do you think that would have put pressure on them

347
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,400
to invent dialect to some extent? It would be interesting to know, wouldn't it? Because yes,

348
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,200
I suspect if they were given a text and given time to prepare, then they may well be drawing on

349
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,360
expressions perhaps from their grandparents or people they knew back at home, rather than just

350
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:14,320
necessarily using the expressions that are natural to themselves. Let's listen to Philip Jarvis from

351
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:21,840
Macclesfield. He's telling the story of the prodigal son. There was a man who had two sons,

352
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,240
the youngest to them said to his father, give me that part of your thing that belongs to me.

353
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:34,640
So, father, give him his share. He's got more dialect words probably than any of the other

354
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,720
speakers that I've heard. I mean, I'm interested particularly in his use of father. Could you

355
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,360
show me something about that? That's right. That's a very traditional broad dialect pronunciation

356
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:51,040
that was widely heard in the Northwest Midlands from that sort of area. And we still hear other

357
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,760
dialect pronunciations, don't we, to this day? We hear father in the north for instance in Yorkshire

358
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,160
and in Lancashire, certainly. And that would have been the original pronunciation in the

359
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,640
northern half of England, father. And that vowel sound was gradually lengthened over time. You hear

360
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,960
father in parts of the north now and certainly you hear father in the south of England.

361
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,320
I'd love to play you a recording we have of a man from Oxfordshire. Wonderful, that sounds fascinating,

362
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:23,920
yeah. There were a man who had two sons, the younger on them said to his father,

363
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,200
give me that part of your good that belongs to me. So, the father gave me share.

364
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,400
There he got rid of all he had. When he got rid of everything, a great famine come over the country.

365
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,720
What do you think of that? Wonderful recording, isn't it, yeah? I suspect to

366
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,400
modern listeners that would sound as if it was from somewhere in the West Country or somewhere

367
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,520
Devon Cornwall door sort of accent, it sounds like, to modern ears, doesn't it? But it's very

368
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,840
typical of speech in Oxfordshire, Berkshire, booking, I'm sure, of that sort of date.

369
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,880
So do you still hear the R pronounced after vowels the way it is on that recording?

370
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,920
Yeah, he says father, doesn't he, and he says adder words with the R pronounced on wherever

371
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,080
it features in the word, doesn't he, and that's something again that is typical of

372
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,400
speech in the West Country these days, isn't it? So do you feel that the nature of rural

373
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,080
Oxfordshire has changed? Absolutely, I mean, Oxford is not very far away from London, so

374
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,400
large parts of the southeast of England have changed quite dramatically, haven't they,

375
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,080
from a rural community to commuter populations, and that's changed the nature of speech in

376
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,480
rural communities in lots of areas in the southeast of England.

377
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,400
John, having heard these recordings, what are your thoughts?

378
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,560
Well, it's been fascinating to hear them, hasn't it, and have a glimpse of dialects of that time,

379
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,560
and certainly things have changed since then, perhaps more dramatically in some parts of the

380
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,120
country than others. But in terms of accent, things have evolved very slowly, and there is

381
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,880
still a great deal of difference as you move across the country in terms of accent. So it's

382
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,160
been great to be able to hear slight differences and also perhaps find a bit of a link with the past

383
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:08,800
as well. In addition to the English voices, Brandon Durgan made 44 Irish, 4 Welsh, and 74

384
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,000
Scottish recordings. We now know that rural accents have been affected by the spread of

385
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,680
cities into the countryside. But what has happened in the more remote corners of the British Isles?

386
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,240
George Campbell, who was recorded in July 1916, was born and brought up in Aberdeen.

387
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:35,040
But the town has changed dramatically since then, as oil workers have moved in, and the fishing

388
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:46,320
industry has declined. 45 again, 45 again, 45! It's all haddock nowadays. Yeah, it's all small

389
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,440
So there's no cod around to speak of? Very, very often. Sometimes Peterhead, they've got bigger

390
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,760
markets, and we only get the buck cheese stuff, like the small boats, all the big boats go over

391
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:07,360
the road now. All right, up the road, up the road to Peterhead. 45 per one, 45.6, 46 per one,

392
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,600
46.7. What's that cost, 60? That's 45 pounds of ox. That's 51 kilos in there, so it's about 80

393
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:22,000
And have you always been in the fish? Yeah, since I was 19, I've been in the fish and there's been

394
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,240
massive changes. I mean, some days there's no fish and there's more at all.

395
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:38,640
What I hear in the fish market is an accent that seems to me absolutely unchanged. It feels as if

396
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,840
it's centuries old. It's not just an accent, it's a dialect. It's a whole code away of speaking.

397
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,320
It's impenetrably thick.

398
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,320
Every accent's got a point of tension, and it's very clear in the Aberdeen accent. I was brought

399
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,440
up in Aberdeen in left when I was 18, and I've still got that point of tension. It's here,

400
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:06,160
it's the upper lip that's very, very immobile. It's something to do with it being the Calvinist

401
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,080
coast, about just covering up your orifice, don't look inside my orifice. It's definitely something

402
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:19,280
to do with that. But it's also the fact that it's bitterly cold here, so everybody's sort of wondering

403
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,400
around like that, sort of shielding their mouths against the cold. The essence of the tone quality

404
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:34,480
in Aberdeen is that it lacks nasality. This is common to ports. People do suffer from sinus problems.

405
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,080
They sound as if they have a bunged up nose. So it happens from Aberdeen, you hear the tone

406
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,600
quality like that, as if I'm not breathing through my nose, into somewhere like Liverpool.

407
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,200
Although you've got a different tone quality, you can hear that I sound bunged up, or even like

408
00:44:51,200 --> 00:45:04,160
New York. It's almost like I've got a cold. I'm sure that George Campbell would have

409
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,880
walked along this beach. Everybody who's an Aberdonian walks along this beach at some point,

410
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:19,440
and it's usually deserted. It's interesting that when he was asked to demonstrate something of his

411
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:26,240
dialect in the Prisoner of War camp, he chose three Scottish songs. He's got a beautiful voice,

412
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:34,960
beautiful tenor voice. He chose three incredibly nostalgic songs by the Bonny Bonny Banks of

413
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:42,960
Loch Lomond, Coming Through the Rye, and John Anderson, Majo John. They're all songs about longing for home.

414
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:57,680
I've come to meet George's son, Alexander Campbell. The father was a very musical man,

415
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,560
wasn't he? Do you have memories of that? Yes, particularly if I say he played the banjo.

416
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,360
I can recollect him playing in the dance bands, mostly Friday or Saturday evenings, as it was in

417
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,160
those days. I believe he did tap dancing as well, is that correct? There's evidence that he did have

418
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,720
the tap shoes with the rattly taps. So he was multi-talented in the musical field. I think he

419
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,200
was the one that would have a go at probably anything. I've got some photographs I managed to

420
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,120
bring out of the old files. Oh, that's fantastic. Maybe the first one is my mother and father,

421
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,560
probably not long after they were married. Oh, that's very nice. Your mum looks very young.

422
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,360
We have one or two from what would appear to be concert parties where he's dressed as the

423
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:50,320
dancing comedian. Oh, I see. And that's an enlargement of the same of him only. So this is George Campbell,

424
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,440
light comedian and dancer. That's fantastic. You look like your father, actually. Well,

425
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,800
probably some of the features are there. This is probably the most intriguing one. It's actually

426
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:11,840
in the camp. Oh, wow. There's the German guard. Eating time. Mealtime and the German guard's got

427
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:20,560
the cigarette between his teeth. Very dirty looking, aren't they? But it looks very casual,

428
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:27,040
doesn't it? Yes. And if they're kilts with aprons over them. Correct. There are so few

429
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,680
photographs of the prisoners who were recorded. It's just fantastic. I think there were more

430
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,520
recordings made of your father's voice than of any other man that I've heard.

431
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,320
So your father's... Maybe not surprising. And your father was obviously... First volunteer.

432
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:53,440
First volunteer and a fantastic example. And then they made all these recordings of him.

433
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,440
Whereas with other people, they made one or two. Your dad was pretty unstoppable when it came to

434
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,080
his recordings. And this is the first song that he...

435
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:51,760
Very good. That's quite intriguing the way it's come over.

436
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,040
Is there anything that surprises you listening to him? No, I can understand. I could picture him

437
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:05,280
singing that. I actually... I find it very touching, you know, this sort of sound of Scotland. Sentimental

438
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:16,080
stuff. Yes. Yes. But I mean, very, very kind of personal stuff. It's odd hearing that. It is odd.

439
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,880
What, like it's a ghostly voice from the past? Or... I'm trying to link it to what I have,

440
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:28,640
by way of any recollection or anything. Your father sings John Anderson Madgeau,

441
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,520
but he also speaks the lyrics because these Germans were very interested in the accent.

442
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,560
So I'd like you to listen to a bit of his speaking voice. I haven't heard of that.

443
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,560
You didn't ever say recite poems or anything, but it would be very interesting to hear that.

444
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:58,320
John Anderson Madgeau, John, when we were first to quench, your locks were like the raven,

445
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:06,080
your body brow would spin. Now we must start up doing John, and hand in hand we'll go,

446
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:13,840
and we'll sleep together at your feet, John Anderson Madgeau. Now you're an old ghost, John.

447
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,480
That last comment sounds like... Does it? I can't quite hear what he says at the end.

448
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,920
I wasn't clear, but it just sounded the way we'd hear that. Say something just off the cuff.

449
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,200
Yes, so it's a wee bit cheeky at the end of the recording for the Germans.

450
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,840
Yes, yes. Take it, I'll leave it. That's right, yes.

451
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,600
Does it make you sad at all listening to it?

452
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,760
Anyway, not dramatically sad, because it's such a long time ago,

453
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,000
but to hear the voice even, the fact that it's there, because apart from a few remnants of

454
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,640
photographs and things that we have, and certificates, there is nothing left, is there?

455
00:50:52,640 --> 00:51:00,960
No. It's a long time ago. There are a couple of copies of the words of the Bonny, Bonny banks

456
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:09,440
of Loch Lomond. Would you read the first verse to me? Read it? I'm not going to sing it. Anyway,

457
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,640
by your Bonny banks and by your Bonny braids, where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond,

458
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,240
there me and my true love spent many happy days on the Bonny banks.

459
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,400
These voices sound so familiar, singing songs and telling stories about their homeland.

460
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,440
It's easy to forget the speakers were imprisoned in Germany.

461
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,800
What was being recorded in this country at that time?

462
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,120
In this sort of period, most of our spoken voice recordings are of famous people,

463
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,440
so statesmen, politicians, royalty, that sort of thing. And any women?

464
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,640
We do have some recordings of women. We've got a very early recording in 1890, for instance,

465
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,720
of Florence Nightingale, and we've also got a recording from 1908 of Christabel Pankhurst.

466
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:15,120
The reasons why women should have the vote are obvious to every fair-minded person.

467
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:20,480
The British Constitution provides that taxation and representation shall go together.

468
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:28,160
The excesses of men must be avoided. They must be compelled by a united and determined

469
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:39,440
women's movement to do justice in this matter. We are resolved that 1909 must and shall see

470
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,560
the political establishment of British women.

471
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,600
Oh, that's fantastic. It's fantastic. But it sounds almost exaggerated with its I, mine,

472
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,560
A's and- That's like one or two slightly, what we might now feel, a slightly old-fashioned

473
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:02,800
vows. I love the way that she belches out the vowel sounds, and the vowel sounds being the

474
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:09,600
sounds that carry the emotion. So she says things like, the excesses of men must be avoided.

475
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,160
That's right. It's very clear and crisp, isn't it? Very clear and crisp, and it gives the vowels full

476
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,960
value, although it's very, very clear on the consonants. That's right. You mentioned to me

477
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,960
earlier that you have a recording of Shackleton. We have, yes, from 1916, I think, yeah. And was

478
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,840
he middle class Southern? He was. He attended Dulwich College. So again, he was very much middle

479
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,920
class. Went to a boarding school, traditional boarding school. Could I listen to him? Absolutely, yeah.

480
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:43,200
The British Antarctic Expedition left New Zealand on the 1st of January, 1908. We restrained our steps

481
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:51,600
over crevasses to soft snow. On the 3rd of March, a party ascended that mountain, and for the first

482
00:53:51,600 --> 00:54:00,640
time in human history, the great mountain Erebus, 13,350 times, was ascended by men.

483
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,080
That's so interesting, because he's much less grand than I imagined he would be. I mean, obviously,

484
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:13,600
he's got a lot of very grand sounds with his man sounding like men. That's right. And he talks about

485
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,640
the time rather than the times, which one associates now with somebody who's trying to

486
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:25,280
sound grand, the driveway and syndrome. Right. But what I'm so fascinated by is that to my ear,

487
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,640
they sound quite neutral, as if they could almost be of now. That's right. There are one or two elements

488
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,160
there that don't sound out of place nowadays, aren't they, in the way he speaks? No. It's such a very

489
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,520
familiar voice, that sort of early broadcast voice, if you like, that the BBC adopted. But as you say,

490
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,480
there are one or two vowels that sound slightly old-fashioned. He talked about falling on his

491
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,400
hands and knees, for instance, where most speakers of his social standing nowadays would say hands,

492
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,400
not hands. So there are one or two things that sound old-fashioned, but lots, as you say,

493
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:59,280
pretty modern, really. I mean, I suppose I've got this idea that sound has a sense of neutralised

494
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:07,920
as time's gone on. So I've assumed that the sound of the 20s and 30s was maybe less strong

495
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,840
than the audience. But actually, it's quite the other case, isn't it? We've got this neutral sound

496
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,680
in Wardian English, and then the no-cow sound, the very, very clipped, upmarket jolly sort of sound

497
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,920
that came after the war. That's right. I think that was very fashionable at the time, wasn't it? It was

498
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,960
a part of a certain social set, and certainly he heard very much in that period. It's fascinating

499
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:36,000
to know more about the accents of the middle classes at that time. But there is a strange irony in

500
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,200
the fact that I've learned so much about how ordinary people spoke from a German sound specialist

501
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:48,240
and an Austrian academic. The significance of these Berlin recordings is that it's often the case

502
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,840
that we think of the First World War as a silent war. We see silent film, silent footage of gray

503
00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:01,920
figures doing soldierly things, but we don't actually hear their voices. So it's very exciting to hear

504
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,760
young contemporary voices speaking about not necessarily the war and their military experience,

505
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,520
but providing us with some idea of what our ancestors sounded like.

506
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,880
So what have I learned about how the Edwardians used to speak? Certainly they articulated their

507
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,200
words and didn't drop their H's and T's as many of us do now. But there's no doubt that regional

508
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:44,000
accents were stronger back then, and as cities have grown and our lifestyles have changed,

509
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,400
they have become diluted. Rural accents are changing all the time as towns spread into the

510
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,480
countryside and youngsters in the country want to sound more and more like city kids. At the same time,

511
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,840
new accents are emerging in the cities, and this is why I find this area so exciting.

512
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:09,440
All these years ago, Brandl recognized this. He said we do not stand before a peaceful sea,

513
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,680
but before an ever-changing stream.

514
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,800
It's incredible to hear these voices speaking to us from so long ago.

515
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,480
It almost feels as if they're coming back to life.

516
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:32,000
In some ways, these prisoners of war were the lucky ones who at least had a better chance of

517
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,040
making it home. But despite the joy of getting back, for many the horror of World War I overshadowed

518
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:47,200
the rest of their lives. Philip Jarvis was one of these men, forgotten by history. He died an

519
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:54,320
unremarkable death at the age of 67, living just 10 miles from where he was born. Five years later,

520
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,960
the stone marking his grave was moved and more bodies were buried in his plot.

521
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,160
Today, Philip's kerbstone lies in a nearby garden.

522
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,640
But now, his voice, along with hundreds of others, lives on.

523
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,080
They are living and breathing again, telling stories of returning home.
