1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
I look at economic analysis in the media, that is not analysis, that is an entertainment product.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,960
If you are not taking these guys and rewarding them for being right,

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,800
and punishing them for being wrong, then they are not analysing their f***ing dancing.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,760
Everybody knows that inequality is getting worse. Well, almost everybody. Anybody serious? Anyway.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,560
For Gary Stevenson, that is the essential trend, not just the last 15 years, but the next 15 years too.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Not that long ago, Gary was one of the most successful traders on the planet.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,400
Now, he's a campaigner around inequality, though he still does the occasional trade as well.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
Gary, it's great to have you joining us on downstream.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,520
Thank you.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,360
We've got a lot to talk about. We'll start right from the beginning.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,360
Age 22 in 2008, you got a job as a trader at Citigroup in Canary Wharf.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Within two years, you made your first million pounds.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
And that's a position that a lot of young people aspire to,

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,120
but you started from a very humble beginning. So, can you walk us through your story,

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,480
where you come from, the Gary Stevenson kind of narrative arc?

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,720
Yeah, okay. So, I'm from Ilford, which is a small suburb of East London.

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,160
Yeah, I come from a pretty poor background.

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
A little terrorist house next to the railway. Got one brother, one sister.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
I was always very good at maths growing up. So, I think if you grew up in East London,

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,560
you know, when I was a kid, we could literally see that the skyscrapers in Canary Wharf going up

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,480
when we were kids. You can't ever assume you're just going to go into banking, right?

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,920
So, that was sort of the path I thought I'd go on.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,280
I got expelled from school when I was 16 for a, I normally call it a drug-related incident.

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
What was it?

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
It was a cannabis, you know.

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,040
You were expelled?

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,640
Yeah, yeah, 16.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,600
Just for smoking cannabis?

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,760
I think I sold about £2 worth of cannabis, which I wouldn't call it a sale.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,720
Yeah, I was young and I don't condone such things, but it happened back then.

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,920
So, I was sort of stuck at home, gave me a bit of a kick up the arse,

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,680
and I was sort of studying for my exams, but I did well in my exams and, you know,

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,440
managed to get good A-levels and went to go to LSE.

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,480
So, LSE, I don't know if you know people from LSE.

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,920
It's a bit of a London School of Economics.

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
It's a bit of an investment bank in Bootcamp.

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,840
And I kind of figured I'd just go there, kill the exams.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,880
I would study maths and economics and get a job as a trader.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,080
That is super hard.

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,480
Well, exactly, to get the job.

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,240
No, maths for a degree is, because I know people that did maths at LSE,

42
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,200
and they were really good maths students at A-level or whatever,

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
but university level maths is incredibly demanding.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,120
I mean, you must be really good at maths.

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
It was my thing as a kid.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,840
Yeah.

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
Yeah, I won a few competitions.

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,640
Math was my thing as a kid.

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,640
It's just sort of the way my mind works.

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,360
But I thought I could just go and just kill the maths exams and get a job.

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
But I remember sort of coming back second year, and suddenly,

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,960
everyone at LSE is just, they start talking in acronyms,

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,160
CDSEs, M&As, MBOs, you know, CDOs, IBD, and I was thinking,

54
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,880
what is going on?

55
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,240
I didn't know anything.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
I spoke to a friend and he was like,

57
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
you have to apply for 35 internships.

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,480
And you hope you get one, and then that's how you get a job.

59
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
And all of these guys, LSE,

60
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,160
LSE is literally full of kids of Russian oligarchs

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,600
and the Chinese Politburo, this international billionaire

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,320
sending the kids to LSE.

63
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,000
And they'd all been prepping from when they were kids.

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,520
They'd all started a charity and checked through the Sahara Desert.

65
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,760
How long did it take you to work this out at the LSE?

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
How long did it take you to work out,

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
okay, the people I'm now studying with at university,

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
it's not like the creme de la creme of the kids at school,

69
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,320
which was what you think it is before you go to university,

70
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,080
but it's actually people I've never met before.

71
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
I remember I was in the math department,

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
which is a bit of sort of, you know what math guys are like.

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,560
And we went on like this sort of away day, like very early on.

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,920
And I brought like a two liter bottle of like white lightning cider

75
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,760
on the coach.

76
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
And I was like, I put some cider, everyone was looking at me

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,160
like I was insane.

78
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,800
And I remember thinking, this is not like what I saw in the movies.

79
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,480
But I was, to be honest, when I was a kid,

80
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
I was like, man on the mission, I'm going to get this job.

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,520
Nothing's going to stop me.

82
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,720
And that's why it was quite dispiriting to realize that basically,

83
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
you have to send all these CVs and cover letters,

84
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,800
and everyone, you've got to fluff it with all this stuff, right?

85
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,040
Like I played clarinet at the Royal Albert Hall,

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,240
you know what I mean, this kind of stuff.

87
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,640
And literally, I was fluffing pillows at DFS.

88
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,960
That's all I had, you know, I tried to be a grime rapper,

89
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
you know, you can't put that on your CV.

90
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,920
You know, I had the little jacket with cadaverous crew in on the back of it.

91
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,720
But like, so I was thinking, how am I going to get this job basically?

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
And I didn't know what to do.

93
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
So I just figured like, I didn't make a single application

94
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,360
because I knew I would never beat these guys on CV and cover letter.

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,960
Like there's nothing, literally, I'm fluffing pillows at DFS in Bekton.

96
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,400
You know, I'm not going to get a job with that.

97
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
So I figured I would just like try and kill these exams

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,480
and like be very sort of like loud about it and hope somebody notices.

99
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,280
And basically, somebody did notice because a guy from near above said,

100
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,920
just I never even met the guy, came up to me in the library one day and he said,

101
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Citibank has one trailer you to a card game.

102
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,840
It's a maths game.

103
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
You win that game, you can get a job.

104
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,120
And I was sort of my ears pricked up because it's like maths.

105
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm good at maths.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm good at games.

107
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,160
So let's just do this.

108
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,320
Right.

109
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
And he explained like the rules of the game to me.

110
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,160
And then I went to the competition.

111
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
I won the LSE round.

112
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,560
And then I basically just stopped going lectures.

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
And I just, all I did was study this one game,

114
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,800
which was like a stupid little math game.

115
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,680
What was the game?

116
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,480
It's like a card game.

117
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,680
It's like a poker style game.

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
They make it basically like everyone has a card

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
and there's another three cards in the middle.

120
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,200
And you just essentially you make bets using a trading style mechanism

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,880
of what the sum total of everyone's cards will be.

122
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,240
So it's probabilities basically.

123
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
Citibank, well, this is actually interesting.

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,320
You say that because the way I won the game was,

125
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,280
I knew that all the mathsy guys would just calculate

126
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,240
the statistical expected value, which meant that

127
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
if someone had a high card, they'd quote high prices.

128
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
And if someone had a low card, they'd quote low prices.

129
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,800
And you could just buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell.

130
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,920
And it's kind of, it's amazing it was that easy.

131
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,840
And other people probably should have realised what I was doing.

132
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,240
But I think this is, I think, another thing

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,000
which has sort of benefited me throughout my career.

134
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,240
Because of the way that I look and the way that I sound,

135
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
I think people just thought I was fucking an idiot basically doing mad stuff.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,000
Like, but it was easy.

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,480
They were playing the numbers and I was playing the game basically.

138
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,600
So I won that competition and the madness of it is what that meant was,

139
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
you know, all these other guys who'd be like learning all these acronyms,

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
you know, and sort of talking to like, you know,

141
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
they were in the investment side, in the finance side,

142
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,800
going to all these events.

143
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,200
And here's me turning up on my internship.

144
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,240
I didn't know anything.

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,440
I didn't know a single acronym.

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,560
I didn't know anything like that.

147
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,640
And the madness thing of it all is, the traders fucking loved it.

148
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,360
They loved me turning up like some kid from down the road.

149
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
Like, just like, I don't know anything, but teach me and I'll do it.

150
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,600
You know what I mean?

151
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,400
And I think it kind of, you know, there's this myth of like the Cockney Wideboy Trader.

152
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,840
But I don't exist.

153
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,640
The Barrow Boy.

154
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,440
Exactly, yeah.

155
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,600
You go there nowadays and it's all just, you know,

156
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,200
it's rich guys from rich families.

157
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,320
It's the same sort of international money delete that goes to LSE.

158
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,880
You know what I mean?

159
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,480
It's, you know, there's some sort of blue bloods in Oxford and Cambridge,

160
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,120
but it's, you know, Baconi and MIT.

161
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,600
And it's all these just rich guys from rich families.

162
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,520
So I think they saw me turn up just like a kid.

163
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,560
Baconi just for viewers.

164
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
It's a university Milan and...

165
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
A finance university, man.

166
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
It's like the Italian LSE, essentially, yeah.

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,040
Yeah, so they loved it and I turned up and

168
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
then the financial crisis happened just after I started.

169
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,000
And then within a few years, I was the most profitable trader in the bank,

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,640
which I guess we'll talk about how that happened.

171
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,360
The Citibank.

172
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
Yeah, Citibank, yeah.

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
So you start this great job off the back of winning a card game.

174
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Yeah.

175
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
An amazing story and it's like, I'm expecting a Netflix film about this.

176
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,920
Yeah, it will come.

177
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,680
Yeah, I suspect so.

178
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,480
You go to work at Citibank.

179
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,320
You walk in first day.

180
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,880
What's that like?

181
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
Trading floor is a big place.

182
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,560
I remember getting the train to Canary Wharf

183
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,600
and the Jubilee line makes this sort of like whooping sound.

184
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,760
It's not like the trains that go past my window.

185
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,120
Yeah, I remember they walked me in.

186
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
I remember just seeing like massive, massive floor.

187
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,480
I think the big thing that hits you about the trading floor is all these screens.

188
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,440
It's like every trader has like a wall of like nine screens.

189
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
Massive wall of screens like that.

190
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,320
And they walk me around and they sort of sat me down,

191
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,040
introduced me to the boss of the desk.

192
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,080
And the boss is high and then he just ignores you, right?

193
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,520
And you're sort of, you're sitting there.

194
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,400
Nobody says anything to you.

195
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,080
This is a thing that have very common experience

196
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
when you start on trading floors is everyone says hi

197
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,040
and then they just totally ignore you.

198
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,120
And it's kind of your job to like get seen basically.

199
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
And then you sort of start to poke around.

200
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,520
Like, can I get you a coffee?

201
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,320
Can I get you a tea?

202
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,960
Can I go get your lunch?

203
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,960
And that sort of, that's like, weirdly, like, I think

204
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,880
I sort of just started just getting everyone's lunch for them.

205
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,120
Yeah.

206
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,320
And I remember this one incident.

207
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,840
But you're an interest rate trader.

208
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,600
Well, I mean, at first I was just an intern, right?

209
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,480
So you're just an intern.

210
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,680
So you've got no specific...

211
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,680
You're just an intern.

212
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
You need to get them to hire you to the desk basically.

213
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,000
Right.

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
And I remember I just used to try and get everybody lunch.

215
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,800
I remember sort of one of my first, one of my first days,

216
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I got a load of people lunch and I took a little note

217
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
of like how much everybody's lunch cost.

218
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,200
And then I put the change on the table, exact, exact change

219
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,880
next to the trader who paid for the lunches.

220
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
And the trader just, he just looked at it.

221
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,880
You know, like when somebody dropped some coins

222
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
and people just looked, he looked at the money

223
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,040
and he was like, what's that?

224
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,320
And I was like, it's your change.

225
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,440
And he was like, it just didn't say anything.

226
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,160
And I was like, it's like £4.31.

227
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,200
And he just slid it across the desk into his little drawer.

228
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,120
And he looked at me right in the face and he said,

229
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
on this desk, we keep the change.

230
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
And I was thinking, these guys are fucking mad basically.

231
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,240
But that's how it works basically.

232
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
And then, you know, I started getting, you know,

233
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,600
I got a lot of lunches.

234
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,640
Eventually they sent me to get like lunch river on the floor.

235
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,280
I think it was this kind of game dynamic

236
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,520
because they knew that I wasn't from that space

237
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,400
and they kind of loved it.

238
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,760
And they were like, played little games with me.

239
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,200
So like, on end of my internship,

240
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,720
they sent me to buy burgers for everyone

241
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,080
on the whole trading floor,

242
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,920
which is like fucking 500 people or something.

243
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,400
Right?

244
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,360
Just called me over, Gary.

245
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,360
Today I'm buying lunch river on the floor.

246
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,360
And I knew they wanted me to be like,

247
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,840
shitting myself.

248
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,880
I was like, yeah, fine.

249
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,680
So I did it.

250
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,280
You know, I had to like get everyone involved.

251
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,960
And then when I came back, I sat down

252
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,400
after delivering burgers to everyone on the floor

253
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,720
and they called me, Gary, Gary, you got a passport.

254
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,680
And I was like, yeah, go home and get it.

255
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,880
You're getting skiing.

256
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,400
And that was like, honestly,

257
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,920
the funniest thing about that was,

258
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
I didn't even realize when you went skiing

259
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,800
that you were in the mountains.

260
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,840
You went to the top of the mountains.

261
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
And it was like, fuck, you know, it was mad.

262
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,480
I remember texting my dad, where's my passport on the train?

263
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,760
So what did you think you were going like cross country

264
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,800
skiing or something?

265
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,040
I just, I only knew like Milton Key and Snowcenters

266
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,920
is the only thing I could think of.

267
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
I just thought it was like on a field or something.

268
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,880
You know where I'm from.

269
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,080
You don't, people don't go skiing.

270
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,480
You know what I mean?

271
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,280
I didn't know about that.

272
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,840
But then that was how I got the job.

273
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
And then 2008, I'll start full time.

274
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
That was when I became like a full time trader.

275
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
And then as soon as I hit that desk, the crisis happened.

276
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,160
And that was sort of.

277
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,960
So when do you start?

278
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,120
Because obviously it's to the best of my recollection

279
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,560
that it's basically August, September,

280
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,080
things really hot up in 2008.

281
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,680
That's like June 30, 2008.

282
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,960
So it's just a couple of months before things go bang.

283
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,160
Yeah.

284
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,960
Yeah, basically.

285
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,000
And I had no idea what was going on.

286
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
But the crazy thing was the desk I worked on,

287
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,240
which was short-term interest rates,

288
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
which is basically short-term loans,

289
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,480
was a very unfashionable desk previous.

290
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,400
They literally make loans of like one day,

291
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,480
which is like not a massively profitable business, right?

292
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,640
And in the credit crisis, 2008, it blew up.

293
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,720
It became unbelievably profitable.

294
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,280
So like they had to really attracted all these sort of

295
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,080
new school, like Yale, Harvard types,

296
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,640
you know, with all of these like immaculate,

297
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,960
like shirts with the little monogram on it.

298
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,320
It was all sort of old school traders.

299
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,080
And then suddenly they're making a ton of money.

300
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,480
And I was just thinking,

301
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
how do I get me some of this money, basically?

302
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,520
How do I follow these guys?

303
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
And just desperately trying to get them to tell me,

304
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,840
like, what are you doing?

305
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,720
How are you making this money?

306
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,400
You're like, what's happening?

307
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,440
And I was trying to figure it out.

308
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,080
And it turned out, so a lot of what they were doing

309
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,400
was basically, it was an American bank

310
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
and they were lending out loads and loads of dollars.

311
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
And it was super profitable

312
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,640
because everybody needed dollars.

313
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
And Citibank at this point is the biggest bank in the world.

314
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,480
Yeah, at that point.

315
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,120
Yeah, yeah.

316
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,400
So they were lending a ton of dollars.

317
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,280
And I remember sort of,

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,800
I figured out what they were doing.

319
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
I lent a ton of dollars too.

320
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,920
And then I was, there was one guy who I worked with.

321
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,760
He was like, he was a scouser.

322
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,400
He was from Liverpool.

323
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,840
He didn't go to university.

324
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
And after I put my first big trade on,

325
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,800
I went home and I thought,

326
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,480
oh fuck, what if this trade goes wrong?

327
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,560
So I went in the next morning, I spoke to this guy,

328
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,360
this scous guy.

329
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
And he said, I said, what's the risk on this trade?

330
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,040
And he said to me, this trade will lose money.

331
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,360
If the global banking system blows up,

332
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,360
in which case you'll lose your job and I'll lose my job.

333
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,640
And it'll be the end of fucking everything.

334
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,080
But that's not going to happen.

335
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,200
So we're going to make a ton of money.

336
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
So you just cross your fingers and hope it works out.

337
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
So the first couple of years, all I did was that basically,

338
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,000
just lend these dollars.

339
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,680
And that was super profitable in 2008, 2009.

340
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,480
Then in 2010, that stopped being profitable.

341
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,680
I remember this weird thing happened.

342
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,440
The Swiss National Bank did something that fucked me.

343
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,040
And I lost like eight million dollars in a week.

344
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,120
And that's when I realized like,

345
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,560
it's not really free money like that.

346
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,960
And I have to start figuring out like a smarter way to make money.

347
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,920
So your first year, 2008, you make 400,000 pounds.

348
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,880
You clear for yourself personally, something like that now.

349
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
Oh no, that was, that was 2008.

350
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,720
So 2008, I started in June, 2008.

351
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,960
2009, my boss who hired me quit basically,

352
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,160
in the middle of the year.

353
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,280
And how come?

354
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,600
I think he made so much money in 2008 that like,

355
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,280
he just thought, I'm going to quit.

356
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,720
I'm going to like live the dream.

357
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,960
I'm going to like build my house in California.

358
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,520
And that's a whole nother story, which we can get into.

359
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,120
But he quit and he said to me,

360
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,160
you can ask me anything you want.

361
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,480
And I said, what do I need to do to make 100 grand for the bank?

362
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,200
At that age, so I would have been 20, just turned 22.

363
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,160
100 grand in my mind was like the most money you could make.

364
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
Like in a year basically.

365
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
What do I have to do to make 100 grand bonus?

366
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,120
You go, it's not possible.

367
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,520
You need to make 10 million dollars for the bank.

368
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,160
He said, I said, all right, I went back,

369
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,720
put one massive bet on 12 million dollars by the end of the year.

370
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,840
And then yeah, and I was expecting to get paid a bonus of like 100 grand.

371
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,680
And I remember going to the meeting room and it was like,

372
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,520
just under 400 grand on the piece of paper.

373
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,880
And I remember looking at it and just being like,

374
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
I remember, I could remember like it was yesterday.

375
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,640
My boss was a massive guy and I pointed at the number.

376
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,840
I thought it must be another number.

377
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,280
I pointed at the number and I said, is it that?

378
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,400
And he said, yeah.

379
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,200
And I literally said, wow, that's a lot of money.

380
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,000
How old are we?

381
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,800
Just turned 23.

382
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
And I think what is weird about that?

383
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,880
You know, there'll be people who hear that story

384
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,920
and they'll be like, that's fantastic.

385
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,480
That's amazing.

386
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,640
Like kids from poor background made a ton of money.

387
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,360
That's really, really good.

388
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,720
And it is good.

389
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
And you know, I wouldn't be able to afford to do what I do now

390
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,440
if it wasn't for that.

391
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,320
But the actual experience of it was like weirdly quite traumatic.

392
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I remember seeing like, if I'd have had 100 grand,

393
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,760
I would have gone home to my parents and be like,

394
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,480
I got 100 grand.

395
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,920
I would tell my mates, I got 100 grand.

396
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,960
Yeah, I would have told my girlfriend about 100 grand.

397
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,240
But like 400 grand just seemed like an inhuman amount of money.

398
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,040
It felt like the kind of money that you couldn't tell anyone about.

399
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,920
It felt like, I felt like, how can I tell my, I went out

400
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,240
and I sat down next to this guy.

401
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
I used to work this gas guy and he could see I was upset.

402
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,680
And he said, go out and like sit down.

403
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,360
And I remember just thinking like, I think about my dad.

404
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,160
You know what I mean?

405
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,240
My dad worked for post office for 35 years

406
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,640
and he was probably never making much more than 20 grand.

407
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,760
And he used to start work.

408
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
He used to leave the house at like 5 a.m.

409
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
And the train used to go past the back of my house.

410
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,520
And my mum would wake me up and we try and look at him,

411
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,120
like wave at him, go and pass the house.

412
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,200
And obviously that's dark, you know, you see him

413
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,560
and you think about how hard he worked day after day after day

414
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,840
for 20 grand a year.

415
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,640
And then here's me, just 10, 23, sitting at a desk,

416
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,400
you know, for a year, 400 grand.

417
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,760
It just seemed like-

418
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,840
You were all of a sudden different to everybody you knew, right?

419
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,960
You're sort of disconnected to them.

420
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,440
Exactly.

421
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,800
That is 100 grand is like a gift.

422
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
400 grand like buys you out of your family,

423
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,840
buys you out of your friend group.

424
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,760
I remember like, I went around my mate's house

425
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,480
and we were playing like Pro Evo.

426
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,400
And they were all talking, a lot of them worked in finance.

427
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,280
Oh, did you get a bonus?

428
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,240
Oh yeah, I got five grand.

429
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh yeah, I got like seven grand.

430
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,080
And then one of them said, did you get a bonus?

431
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,120
And I didn't tell anyone.

432
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,000
And I just thought, you know what?

433
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200
These are like my closest friends.

434
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,480
I'm just going to fucking tell them, right?

435
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,880
So I told them, oh yeah, I got 395 grand.

436
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,400
And you could just like hear like the silence,

437
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,440
like feel the room of this like shock.

438
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,080
And it was almost, and then it started to feel like,

439
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,880
it started to feel like a cruel thing to tell people

440
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,840
in a weird way.

441
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,200
I made this amount of money.

442
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,600
And it was a, and it's, I know it's bizarre,

443
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
but I think in a weird way it was a cruel thing

444
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,000
to happen to me.

445
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,080
And I know that sounds crazy, but it's just,

446
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
that level of inequality, you know,

447
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,760
I made a lot more than that in following years.

448
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,320
You know what I mean?

449
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
But like, it shouldn't exist.

450
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,960
It shouldn't happen.

451
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,760
You know what I mean?

452
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,240
It shouldn't.

453
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,880
And it's, don't get me wrong, right?

454
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,960
I think that people who work hard and are talented

455
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,560
and do good things should make money.

456
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
I think we should live in a world where that is possible,

457
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,280
100%.

458
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,160
But like, people like me and people where I'm from,

459
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,000
didn't even know that 400 grand was a thing

460
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,960
somebody could make.

461
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,080
I had no idea.

462
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,760
And then like, I was thinking,

463
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,440
if I've made 400 grand, what have the rest of these

464
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:09,920
fuckers made?

465
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,720
You know what I mean?

466
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,760
I was just looking around,

467
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,520
me thinking like, what is going on?

468
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
So yeah, it was, it was a, it was a mad experience.

469
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,880
You were city's most profitable trader globally

470
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,240
at one point, is that correct?

471
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,560
Yeah.

472
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,920
So that was 2011.

473
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,960
So basically like,

474
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,720
so this is after you've lost the money from?

475
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,040
Yeah.

476
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,360
So this sort of just lending the dollar stopped working

477
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,680
basically.

478
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,040
And I had to realize, I had to think like,

479
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,520
we're going to have to,

480
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,840
we're going to have to figure out a smarter way

481
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,640
to make money.

482
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,600
And so the history of this is actually quite interesting,

483
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:37,760
right?

484
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,120
So I was an interest rates trader.

485
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,240
We're going to get a bit technical here,

486
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,280
but we'll keep it simple.

487
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120
So in 2008, all the interest rates in the,

488
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,960
in the rich world collapsed to zero,

489
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,040
because central bank cuts rates.

490
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,080
We want to boost the economy.

491
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,040
The economy is really shit.

492
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,160
So everybody cut their rates.

493
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,640
And then our job became basically

494
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
to bet on when more rates go up again.

495
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,360
And rates will go up when the economy recovers.

496
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,640
You know, that's a simplification,

497
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,960
but you know, that's basically what happens.

498
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,400
And interest rates stayed zero from 2008

499
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
until this year basically, 2022,

500
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
which is 14 years.

501
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
And in every single one of those years,

502
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
markets and economies predicted

503
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,640
that rates would go up the next year,

504
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,600
which was wrong 12, 13 years in a row,

505
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,880
which is interesting, right?

506
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
These are the best paid guys in the world

507
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,560
to do this thing.

508
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,400
And they're wrong year after year.

509
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
This is like if you studied, you know,

510
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,160
weather forecasting at uni

511
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,240
and you went to work at like the Met

512
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
and you saw that every single year,

513
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,280
every single day that like tomorrow's

514
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
going to be like sunny and 30 degrees,

515
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,640
you know, and they're always wrong.

516
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,520
So, you know, this happened in 2008.

517
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
And they're like, it'll get better next year.

518
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,320
It didn't 2009.

519
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,680
Okay, it was quite serious.

520
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,280
Maybe next year, 2010.

521
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,960
They're like, okay, well, just give it one more year.

522
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,520
And sort of, by sort of late 2010,

523
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
I'd seen these guys be wrong for two and a half years.

524
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,920
And I started to think like, maybe they're just wrong.

525
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,280
Maybe there isn't a recovery.

526
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,520
I think the big thing for me was,

527
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,280
because I came from a poor background,

528
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,120
and, you know, I still had the same friends,

529
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,840
the same family.

530
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,560
I could see that things were getting actively worse

531
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,520
for people from where I'm from.

532
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,600
And it was like, well, how do you expect,

533
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,920
the idea behind cutting interest rates

534
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,200
is you get people spending money on

535
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
because you can borrow money cheaply.

536
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
Oh, it's great, spend money.

537
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
But I look at the situation of my friends and family

538
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,200
that I grew up with.

539
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
These guys are losing their homes, right?

540
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,920
Their parents had property.

541
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,040
They'll never own property.

542
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,880
So they're getting poor year after year.

543
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,120
How the fuck are they going to start spending money

544
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
because you give them access to a cheap loan?

545
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
They don't even get access to that money.

546
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,400
They can't go and borrow money at zero percent.

547
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,880
You know what I mean?

548
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,920
So I started to look at this and I started to think,

549
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
I don't see it happening.

550
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,600
I don't see it happening.

551
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
And I guess I was in this sort of quite unique position

552
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,520
because there's not many people that go from

553
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,480
poor backgrounds to working in trading nowadays.

554
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,640
So I could see what it was like for ordinary people.

555
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,000
And I could also see what it was like

556
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,680
for these rich guys working in the city.

557
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,960
You know, it's a bunch of millionaires working in the city.

558
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,200
Do you also think because you started in 2008,

559
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
you had no sort of prior expectations?

560
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,120
Whereas somebody has been in the industry 25 years,

561
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,960
they've seen lots of ups and downs.

562
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
And so there's going to be a bunch of cognitive biases

563
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,520
where they say, I was here in the mid-80s.

564
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,720
I was here in the early 90s.

565
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,160
I was here for .com.

566
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,520
This is just the same.

567
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,800
But actually you didn't have any of that because there's all you knew.

568
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,320
I guess they're used to interest rates up and down.

569
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
They weren't used to this sort of flat lining, I think.

570
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,680
But you know, I think if you consider how long that went on for,

571
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,320
you know, even at the beginning of 2020,

572
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,480
people were still predicting rates going to go up later that year.

573
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,480
That's 12 years.

574
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
12 years of incorrect predictions.

575
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,800
It's incredible.

576
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
I think that's, you know,

577
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
we could have a whole discussion about why it is that happens.

578
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,800
And you know, I went back to Oxford 2017-2019

579
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,840
and I asked one of the professors,

580
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,200
we had an electoral interest rates.

581
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,000
And I went up to him afterwards and I said,

582
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,800
why do you think we were so,

583
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,480
we were wrong on these interest rates for so long?

584
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,120
And he said, oh no, we always knew rates would stay zero.

585
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
And I was like, I didn't know what to say to that

586
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,000
because, you know, this is my job, you know.

587
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,480
I know for fact that these guys predicted interest rates

588
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,680
would go back up every single year.

589
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,280
And I was like, no, you didn't.

590
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,000
It was like, yeah, we knew.

591
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,800
We knew.

592
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,240
I just said, I'm going to go home.

593
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm going to send you the data and then we're going to talk about it.

594
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,680
2017, he said that.

595
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,320
Yeah, 2017.

596
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
Because even you had Janet Yellen before then

597
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,480
putting up US interest rates in like 2014, 2015,

598
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
they were saying, oh, we're going to try and go back to normal.

599
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,800
Yeah, which eventually came down again.

600
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,280
Yeah.

601
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,240
And I said, so I sent him the data and he was like, oh, that's interesting.

602
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,840
Yeah, we have been wrong for 10 years.

603
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
And his guy, right,

604
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,840
professor of macroeconomics at Oxford University,

605
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,920
he's been wrong for 10 years.

606
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,400
Not only has he been wrong for 10 years in a row,

607
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,320
he's not realized that he's done that.

608
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
That is the level we are at here of economics.

609
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,240
But look at this guy, rich guy, rich family.

610
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,760
He used to wear a nice snake skin belt.

611
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,320
You know what I mean?

612
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
He doesn't get hurt, does he?

613
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
This guy's wrong 10 years in a row.

614
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,640
He never gets hurt.

615
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,920
Of course, he doesn't notice.

616
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,400
You know what I mean?

617
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,200
I always, you know,

618
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
I wrote some articles at the beginning of COVID saying like,

619
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,360
this is going to cause a massive increase in inequality.

620
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,120
It's going to cause a massive increase in house prices.

621
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,800
It's going to cause a massive inflationary crisis.

622
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,200
Okay.

623
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,120
At the same time, Larry Elliott,

624
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
like chief economics editor at The Guardian,

625
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,360
was writing house prices are going to collapse.

626
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,600
Okay.

627
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,520
That was obviously wrong.

628
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,880
Who's punishing Larry Elliott?

629
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,680
You know what I mean?

630
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,920
But why was, wait, so at the beginning of COVID?

631
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Yeah, because there was briefly,

632
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,440
there was briefly a buyer's market

633
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,600
because you did have lots of people with like student homes,

634
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
buy to let landlords, they just thought,

635
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
you know what, this is going to be unoccupied for God knows how long.

636
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
The margins are low, you should get rid.

637
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,160
So you got, you did get a big flood of those properties.

638
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,120
For a brief moment, yeah.

639
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,080
For about three, four months.

640
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,640
I remember, and it was less that the market fell,

641
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,760
there was just uncertainty.

642
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
So you could get real value.

643
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,600
Yeah.

644
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,360
But I think what people were missing was,

645
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
we knew at the beginning of COVID,

646
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
the government is going to give a shit ton of money out.

647
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,920
And in the end, the government gave out 600 billion pounds,

648
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,960
which I want to emphasize,

649
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,560
is 12,000 pounds for every single adult in the country.

650
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay.

651
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,480
That's how much money the government gave out.

652
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,200
Okay.

653
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
And if anyone was bothered to do the analysis,

654
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,560
which basically nobody was,

655
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
you could see very quickly that that money is going to go

656
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,720
overwhelmingly to richest people in the country.

657
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,440
You could work that out.

658
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,800
We can go through the logic of that, right?

659
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,600
If there's a video on my YouTube,

660
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,320
exactly, you could see 600 billion pounds

661
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,000
is going to go to the richest people in the country.

662
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,280
They're going to fucking buy houses.

663
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,480
What the fuck house they're going to do with it?

664
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,720
You know, we're literally talking about 100, 200 grand per person.

665
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,000
Of course, house prices are going to go.

666
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
And I think there's this real,

667
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,640
I think the big problem is,

668
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,760
number one, there's very few economists

669
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,800
from poor backgrounds, right?

670
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
So then they're not really keyed into what's happening.

671
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,440
And number two, they don't get punished if they're wrong.

672
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
They don't get punished if they're wrong.

673
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,320
They don't get rewarded if they're right.

674
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,760
What sort of punishment would you like them to see?

675
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,440
Because obviously, you mean they lose legitimacy

676
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
and there's no counter incentives, right?

677
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,120
If you're right, you get low substates if you're wrong.

678
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm not asking for these guys to be spanked in the streets, right?

679
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,400
At least knowledge is that they were wrong.

680
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,400
This guy at Oxford University, wrong for 10 years,

681
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,920
didn't even notice.

682
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,400
You know what I mean?

683
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,520
At least have some, you know, I'm from a poor background, right?

684
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,480
I walk onto the trading floor.

685
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
Within two years, I'm famous because I'm the guy who gets it right.

686
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,640
You know, I've been writing articles

687
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,560
for like two and a half years now about COVID.

688
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,600
And, you know, go read my articles from the beginning of COVID.

689
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,920
Every single thing I said would happen has happened, you know?

690
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,880
But, you know, I don't get the attention that Larry Elliot gets.

691
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,480
He's wrong in all his predictions.

692
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,000
You know, I mean, the problem is, if you don't have any mechanism

693
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,040
by which people who are consistently right get recognized

694
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,480
and people who are consistently wrong get shown up for being wrong,

695
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,760
then you will get shit analysis.

696
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,960
Of course you will.

697
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,080
It's obvious, isn't it?

698
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,160
And not only that, but it is inevitable

699
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,680
you'll end up with a posh boys club.

700
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,400
Because if you have no mechanism

701
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,320
by which people who actually understand

702
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,560
but are from don't have the social capital

703
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,160
can challenge people who are just chatting shit

704
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,360
but do have the social capital,

705
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,840
then you will just end up, you know,

706
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
how am I going to, how are people going to find my article?

707
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
You know what I mean?

708
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,680
You know, whereas in the city,

709
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,920
I could walk into any skyscrapers in Canary Wharf

710
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,200
and get paid a million pound a year.

711
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Because these guys will look at my track record

712
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
and say, this guy keeps getting it right.

713
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,160
So actually there's more of a sort of meritocratic attitude

714
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,400
in the city than in journalism or academia.

715
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,160
Listen, there is no meritocracy in media.

716
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,680
And to be honest, in my opinion,

717
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,760
I look at economic analysis in the media,

718
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
that is not analysis.

719
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,320
That is an entertainment product.

720
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
If you are not taking these guys

721
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,720
and rewarding them for being right

722
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,240
and punishing them for being wrong,

723
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,720
then they are not analyzing their fucking dancing.

724
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,600
That's what they're doing.

725
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,760
You know, like, if you want them to be right,

726
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,120
pay them to be fucking right.

727
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,960
But we're not doing that, are we?

728
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,840
We're not doing that.

729
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
And if you think at the same time, right,

730
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,320
imagine you are an economist who's good,

731
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,280
who's really good.

732
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,960
You know what's happening, right?

733
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
You can write an article that's perfectly right

734
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,720
and no one will ever fucking read it.

735
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
Or you can go and work for fucking Bank of America

736
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,360
and get paid a million pound a year.

737
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,520
You know, that is the system that we've built.

738
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,880
And then we're surprised that the economy goes to shit.

739
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,840
You know, if you want, if you want good analysis,

740
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,400
at the very least, recognize good analysis.

741
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,640
This, nobody's even checking the homework here.

742
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,440
It's crazy.

743
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,240
There is some, well, I agree with you entirely.

744
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,800
But financial times, certain journalists,

745
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,320
instead of Ambrose Evans Pritchard at the Telegraph,

746
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,600
for instance, is really good on Russia

747
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,760
and the long-term consequences of what's going on there.

748
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,640
Generally speaking, I entirely agree with you.

749
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
And like you say, the incentives are much higher

750
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,840
to shut your gob and just make loads of money.

751
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,960
And the incentives aren't there to actually

752
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,480
have top, top finance journalists.

753
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,960
And I agree with you at the BBC,

754
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,720
which of course is where most people get there,

755
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,920
media in the UK, in most newspapers.

756
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,040
You might as well not bother being quite and quite informed

757
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,160
because you're not being informed.

758
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,520
Yeah.

759
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,840
But there are some good sources of news, surely,

760
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,320
because you yourself must consume new sources on this stuff.

761
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,040
So where are they?

762
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,720
To be totally honest, what I do more than anything else

763
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
is I trade and I talk to traders.

764
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,640
Listen.

765
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,400
There must be, there must be, there must be creditable,

766
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,800
there must be more creditable news sources

767
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,640
that at least some legitimacy is given to.

768
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
Blogs, podcasts.

769
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,520
You tell me.

770
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
There are good individuals.

771
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,280
You have good individuals who have good analysis.

772
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,200
I was never really a news reader.

773
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,680
I hired a guy to sit next to me and read the papers

774
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,320
and tell me like what's, because as a trader,

775
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,400
you need to know what people think.

776
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,320
Because as a trader, you don't make money just by being right.

777
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
You make money by being right specifically

778
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,840
when other people are wrong.

779
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,160
So it's actually like the art of understanding

780
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,440
the way in which people are wrong.

781
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,160
You know what I mean by that?

782
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,360
Because if everybody knows something,

783
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,000
it's not monetized.

784
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,800
It's not valuable exactly.

785
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,640
To be honest, I mean, I watch the news now largely because

786
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,720
I've moved away from purely financial analysis.

787
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,280
And now I'm in a space where what I want to do

788
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,520
is explain to people what's happening

789
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,640
to change the way that they view it and the way that they act.

790
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,400
So I need to know what you're being told

791
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,080
so I can explain to you why it's wrong.

792
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,760
There are good people who do good analysis.

793
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,280
There's, oh, I forget the names now.

794
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,040
There's the Norwegian guy at Financial Times.

795
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,480
I spoke to him, I should remember his name.

796
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,200
He's quite good.

797
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,800
But to be honest, when it comes to economics,

798
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,400
like I trade.

799
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,080
I trade.

800
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,880
That's what I do.

801
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,560
In terms of long-term market signals,

802
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,840
in terms of political risk,

803
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,440
and you think this might happen or this might happen,

804
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,840
where are you saying, oh, that's good information then?

805
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,960
So I talk to traders all the time.

806
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,560
The long-term implications, for instance,

807
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,240
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine

808
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,800
and what that means are the kinds of trades

809
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,000
you'd be involved in.

810
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
Clearly, you need source of information about that

811
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,280
because you're not in Ukraine.

812
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,920
Yeah, I mean, I think it's important basically

813
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,840
to know what you know about and what you don't know about.

814
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,760
I think that actually, in my opinion,

815
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,600
the economic significance,

816
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,680
the war in Ukraine is obviously a terrible thing.

817
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,080
But the economic significance of it in this country,

818
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,720
I think has been significantly overplayed, in my opinion.

819
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,040
I think that the inflation that we're seeing,

820
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,960
specifically in energy markets,

821
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,720
of course, it's affected the energy markets, right?

822
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
But look what's happening to London housing,

823
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,680
what's happening to London rents.

824
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,520
So Vladimir Putin didn't do that.

825
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,320
And I've been saying, from the beginning of COVID,

826
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,120
you know, we're giving 600 billion pounds to rich people.

827
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,040
If you don't expect an inflation in Christ after that,

828
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,400
then you don't understand money.

829
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,000
So you would put, let's say, well, we're at 10% now

830
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,440
and we don't know where we're going.

831
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,200
It was scheduled to go significantly higher.

832
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,280
We don't know because there's big intervention from government.

833
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,920
You would say, actually, the inflation we're seeing in this country

834
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,720
is more to do with quantitative easing

835
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,040
and printing money than Vladimir Putin.

836
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,480
I would say it's to do with the very large government deficit

837
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
during COVID and who ended up with that money.

838
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,560
I think people don't realize that there's two sides to the balance sheet, right?

839
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,640
If the government gives out 600 billion pounds,

840
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,800
then somebody gets 600 billion pounds.

841
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,640
600 billion pounds is a fucking lot of money, right?

842
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,080
That's 12,000 pounds per adult in the entire country.

843
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,280
So if you don't have 12,000 pounds more cash now than you had three years ago,

844
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,200
someone's got your 12,000 pounds.

845
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,080
That's a lot of fucking money.

846
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,840
And if you, you know, if we assume that that all went to top 10%, right,

847
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,800
which I think is a good sort of first order approximation,

848
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,800
that means every single adult in the top 10% richest people in the country

849
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,960
getting 120 grand cash, that fucking happened.

850
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,840
You know, and where did that cash go?

851
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,720
Well, they're going to, well, I think the thing is,

852
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,080
the interesting thing is you can't get rid of it once it's out there, right?

853
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,040
It only circulates, right?

854
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,360
So the first thing they do is they try and buy assets

855
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,400
because that's what rich people do.

856
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,160
So that's why we saw this massive boom in the stock market

857
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
and that's why we saw this massive boom in house prices.

858
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,880
But the thing about that is that doesn't get rid of the money, right?

859
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
I try and buy your house, you try and buy my house,

860
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,160
we're just stopping the money between us.

861
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,680
So the prices go up.

862
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,360
What you will see is some richer people buying the houses of poorer people

863
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
and that will often happen generationally.

864
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,240
So for example, a lot of my friends from poorer backgrounds

865
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,440
who've been saving up really hard 70, 80 grand deposits.

866
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,000
Nowadays, you can't buy a house with 70, 80 grand deposit in London.

867
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,760
Suddenly, they're competing with the kids of richer families.

868
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Their parents giving them the 300 grand and then so they don't get the house.

869
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,920
So what you see is generationally houses

870
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,000
that would have been bought by kids from poorer families

871
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,600
are now being bought by kids from richer families.

872
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,320
So you do see a loss of asset ownership in the poor.

873
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,680
But essentially, the money doesn't disappear, it just circulates.

874
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,400
If the government gives money out until the government taxes it back,

875
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,080
people will have more money.

876
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,480
And the big question is, who will have more money?

877
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,280
And that is the question that nobody was asking during COVID.

878
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,840
Do you think quantitative easing was a mistake then?

879
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,960
Because obviously that creation of more money isn't just a response to COVID.

880
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,920
That's been the default alongside low interest rates since 2008.

881
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,120
That's a really good question.

882
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,560
And my answer is actually no.

883
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,400
And I think that might surprise some people.

884
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,920
When I say what I said that inflation was caused

885
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,240
by the government giving money out and by the low interest rates,

886
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,880
you might think that I'm opposed to the government giving money out and low interest rates.

887
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,520
I'm not.

888
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,040
The government had to do that.

889
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
I'm not opposed to furlough at all.

890
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,760
I'm not opposed to the massive deficits the government ran during COVID at all.

891
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,560
Those had to be done.

892
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,240
Otherwise, people would have literally died.

893
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,280
People would have not paid the rent.

894
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,080
People would have become homeless.

895
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,200
People would have not been able to eat.

896
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,320
Had to be done.

897
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,280
But at the same time, if you're giving out £600 billion,

898
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,000
you have to do an analysis of who's going to end up with this money.

899
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
And if that analysis had been done,

900
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,760
then we would have seen, well, we're injecting a massive amount of money to the rich here.

901
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,560
A massive amount.

902
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,080
And then we had the period of lockdown when that money wasn't damaging,

903
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,320
because the rich couldn't really spend it, because they're locked at home.

904
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,120
We could have used that one and a half years, two years, to say,

905
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,720
okay, we have to do this thing, which is going to make the rich fucking rich.

906
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,360
So we use the time we have to work out a way to tax them effectively to take that money back.

907
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,600
If you give £600 billion to the rich, and you don't want to see effects,

908
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,120
you have to find ways to take that money back.

909
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,720
And we had a year and a half where we could have had a sensible conversation about,

910
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,920
okay, look, COVID's shit, we had to do this thing,

911
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
and it's going to massively increase inequality.

912
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,880
We need to figure out how to stop that from happening.

913
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,520
And we didn't have that conversation, because nobody was talking about who's

914
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,240
going to end up with this money.

915
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,400
So the problem is not that the money was given out.

916
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,920
And the problem is not the low interest rates.

917
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,960
The problem is, we have an economic system here that is very happy to give tons of money to the rich,

918
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,480
and has no mechanism of reliably getting money from the rich.

919
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,160
That is fucking not sustainable.

920
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,560
And the thing that really worried me, now you see energy prices going up,

921
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,680
what's the solution, £150 billion direct from the government to the energy companies.

922
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,280
So if you believe my analysis that the government deficit

923
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,920
and increasing inequality caused inflation,

924
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,760
their solution is another massive government deficit that will increase inequality.

925
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,840
And I went out and I saw the fuck ton of government bonds,

926
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,960
because I was like, these guys are trying to fix inflation with inflation.

927
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,480
Listen, you need to have the systemic ability to take wealth away from rich people,

928
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,640
because there's a massive systemic force to give wealth to rich people.

929
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,760
If every time there's a crisis, you give a fuck ton to the rich,

930
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,240
and you have no mechanism of taking money back from the rich,

931
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,440
then you will impoverish and bankrupt your government and your fucking middle class.

932
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
And we're seeing it in front of our eyes.

933
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,160
And what frustrates me the most is just the lack of a discussion of,

934
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,840
listen, in Covid we gave them £600 billion with no mechanism of getting it back from them.

935
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,040
Well, in fact, we've actually just reduced their taxes.

936
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,320
I mean, that was one of the maddest things I've seen in my life.

937
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,680
And yeah, but when I saw that, I got very emotional when I saw that.

938
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,520
When I saw that, you know, and this is for you and for me, right?

939
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,320
When I saw that, I thought this is because me and people like me

940
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,360
have not explained clearly enough to the people of this country

941
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:19,120
that if the government gives you £10 and the rich £1,000, you are getting poorer.

942
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,480
Because in Covid, the average family accumulated like one, two grand cash,

943
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,200
and every rich family accumulated like 300 grand cash, okay?

944
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,200
And that had the obvious predictable consequences, right?

945
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,480
Money is not real resources.

946
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,600
If I give you 100 quid and him 100 grand, you have gotten poorer.

947
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,360
So after Covid, people had more money.

948
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,200
Explain that because they would say, no, we've both got richer,

949
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,280
but they've just got much richer than I have.

950
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,640
Let's break this down.

951
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,560
Money is not food.

952
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,920
Money is not energy.

953
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,440
Money is not housing.

954
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,120
Money is not healthcare, okay?

955
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,040
If we give everybody money, we have not increased the amount of actual resources

956
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,960
and assets we have in our society, okay?

957
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,760
So you don't make society richer by giving people money.

958
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,680
You make society richer by creating and having more resources and assets.

959
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,640
So if I give everybody more money, all that happens is the prices go up.

960
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,520
But if I give you a bit of money and him a lot of money,

961
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,080
then he gets richer and you get poorer because you have a bit more money,

962
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,920
but the prices have gone up relative to both of your increases in money.

963
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
So I think this is the thing I want to...

964
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,320
And the reason I'm hammering this down is because they did that in Covid

965
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,440
and they got away with it.

966
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,960
And to be honest, the conservative government lucked out with the Ukraine war

967
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
because that took the entire blame for the inflation,

968
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,000
which in my opinion was caused by their massive increase in inequality.

969
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,120
And because they got away with it, I'm not surprised to see them do it again

970
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,680
because what they did in the tax cuts was quite interesting, right?

971
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,120
They cut the taxes on ordinary people by a little bit, like 50 quid a month.

972
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,120
Let's just... for our audience, we've got a bunch of tax cuts here,

973
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,400
so corporation tax didn't go up.

974
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,680
We'll park that for a moment.

975
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,520
The basic rate, which we all pay, cut by 1%,

976
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,000
but that benefits wealthier people far more than ordinary people.

977
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,080
Well, yeah, they cut the basic rate by 1%.

978
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,360
It doesn't really give you that much more money.

979
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,560
It's like 50 quid a month, you know?

980
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,200
And only if you're like a higher middle learner,

981
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,040
if you're a lower middle learner, it doesn't benefit you at all, right?

982
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,960
But they cut your taxes a tiny bit

983
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,440
and then they cut the taxes of millionaires by like 50 grand.

984
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,040
And then my mate called me up, he's from an ordinary background,

985
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,480
and I was explaining that to him and he was like,

986
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,440
you know, I think my mates might be happy because they got this 50 quid tax cut, right?

987
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,080
And people need to understand if the government gives you 50 quid

988
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,400
and the rich 50 grand, you will have more money

989
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,080
and you will get less food, less energy, less housing, less health care,

990
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,440
because money is the asset that we use to determine the distribution of real assets.

991
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,360
Money does not make people rich.

992
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,200
Money is how we determine distribution.

993
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,080
Yeah, you can have as much money as you want, right?

994
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,160
If it doesn't buy you housing, if it doesn't buy you food,

995
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,760
it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, does it?

996
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,920
So people need to understand that because the government

997
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,880
has struck on this idea here where we give every poor person a bit of cash,

998
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,040
and we give every rich person a ton of cash.

999
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,520
And then the end result is prices go up a ton and ordinary people,

1000
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,200
they don't understand why they're getting poorer.

1001
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,040
Why? Because I've got more money, why is it happening?

1002
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,720
And it's not just the inflation, obviously, like you said.

1003
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,360
Wealthy people, they don't need to spend money,

1004
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,760
they've already got loads of money, so they pump that into assets.

1005
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,600
And then, of course, the assets are generally

1006
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,480
ways for them to make more money because they're living off the revenues from those assets.

1007
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,320
And of course, that's the rentierism that poor people find themselves subject to.

1008
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
I always say, yeah, I always say this, you know,

1009
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,240
we talk about shook with economics, if you give them money,

1010
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,960
that the wealth create is like they're fucking Gandalf or something, right?

1011
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,320
If you give them money, they'll boost the economy.

1012
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,320
If you give these guys money, they're going to fucking buy your mum's house.

1013
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
That is what they're going to do.

1014
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,480
Listen, my friends' mums had houses, and my friends will never have houses.

1015
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,720
Those houses are not fucking disappearing.

1016
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,760
Those houses are owned by rich people's kids now.

1017
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
That is what this means.

1018
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,360
This is ordinary families losing their fucking homes,

1019
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,520
and they will never have houses again.

1020
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,360
Their kids won't have houses, their grandkids,

1021
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,200
this is serious.

1022
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,200
You cannot give all of your assets away and expect not to be poor.

1023
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,480
Not only that, but we're giving the assets away to this group of rich people

1024
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,040
who are internationally mobile and don't pay any fucking taxes.

1025
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,320
I think it's, you know, I was not born and raised political.

1026
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,600
I do this because it was my job to look into the future

1027
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,680
and tell you what is going to happen to the economy.

1028
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,680
If we do not find a way to tax rich people seriously,

1029
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,560
the future of this economy is going to be a disaster.

1030
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,840
It's going to be a disaster because the government's going further into debt.

1031
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,600
Ordinary families are losing their homes.

1032
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,280
Ordinary families are going further into debt,

1033
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,000
and the homes are going to the rich and the debt is to the rich.

1034
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,360
And it's, as you say, what that means then is you pay more rent to the rich.

1035
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,960
You pay higher mortgages to the rich.

1036
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
So as inequality gets bigger,

1037
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,320
the cash flows from ordinary families to the rich get bigger,

1038
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,920
which means inequality will get bigger still.

1039
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,440
So it creates this really negative spiral.

1040
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,160
You know, this is all, it's not an optimistic outlook,

1041
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,200
but that is why I do what I do.

1042
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,360
And but the thing that is most maddening is,

1043
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,320
and also the thing which can give us a bit of hope is it's fixable

1044
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,000
because those assets have not disappeared.

1045
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,200
They are owned by the rich.

1046
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,960
And if we fix our tax system,

1047
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,400
we can, we can, we can get them given back to ordinary families.

1048
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,240
You've got a quote here, which I'm going to refer to.

1049
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,280
You've been a successful trader.

1050
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,080
We've talked about that.

1051
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,360
You're academically credentialed.

1052
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,160
We talked about that.

1053
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,000
I mean, it helps to be good in both fields

1054
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
because then people can't try and discredit you.

1055
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,680
You did maths and economics at the LSE and feel like you said Oxford.

1056
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,920
But you've said, quote, throw your textbooks in the bin

1057
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,800
if you want to really learn about economics.

1058
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,240
So you've already talked about that one academic

1059
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,080
who thought he wasn't a serious guy.

1060
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,760
You're basically saying, look,

1061
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,120
if you want to know what the story is,

1062
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,160
don't bother with the sort of fusty dons

1063
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,000
at these allegedly top universities.

1064
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,240
Yeah.

1065
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,800
That is a line from this Scous Trader who I used to work with.

1066
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,080
He was the only trader I worked with.

1067
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,960
He didn't go to university.

1068
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,160
He's from Liverpool and he worked,

1069
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,160
he worked on the cash desk when he was 18

1070
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,400
and he worked as we're up to being like the top trader of Citibank.

1071
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,480
And I was a Citibank's top trader in 2011

1072
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,400
and he was Citibank's top trader in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013.

1073
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,440
This guy was a fucking genius.

1074
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,880
And when I got smashed that,

1075
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,480
when I lost that $8 million that one week,

1076
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,920
I brought up my instinct as a good economic student

1077
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,760
was to go and bring my textbooks in

1078
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,600
and start reading it and being like, what's happening?

1079
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,960
And he came up to me and just fucking grabbed him

1080
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,000
and he threw him in the bin.

1081
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,760
And he was like, listen, how fucking old are you?

1082
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,440
And I was like, I don't know, 23, 24, whatever.

1083
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,600
You are not going to learn about it from those fucking books.

1084
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,720
You want to learn about the economy?

1085
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,040
Go out onto the street, walk down the high street,

1086
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,400
see what shops are closing down.

1087
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,000
Look at what the adverts are on the tube.

1088
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,880
You know what I mean?

1089
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,640
Is there more homeless people that you're seeing?

1090
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,720
Ask your mum about her financial situation.

1091
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,800
Ask your friends and your friends' mums

1092
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,080
about their financial situation.

1093
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,600
That is the fucking economy.

1094
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,400
And look, I'm not saying nobody should study economics, all right?

1095
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,680
But you should be using your study of economics

1096
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,040
to get you into a situation

1097
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,960
where you can analyze the real world.

1098
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,640
And I'm going to use an example

1099
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,960
to illustrate the problem that we have here, okay?

1100
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,200
So this professor, the snakeskin belt professor, he...

1101
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,880
What was the belt?

1102
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Did you know the belt make was Gucci or something like this?

1103
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,440
I didn't ask him.

1104
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,160
I don't think he'd tell me.

1105
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,040
He's not my big fan.

1106
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,440
He wrote a paper where he said that if the European Central

1107
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,040
Mac didn't do QE, European GDP would be like 4.7% lower,

1108
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,920
something like that.

1109
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,240
And I was quite pleased to see him make a firm prediction

1110
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,520
for once because these guys very rarely make

1111
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,000
firm predictions.

1112
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,200
And I put my hand up and I said to him,

1113
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,480
do you think that's right?

1114
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,040
And he was like, what do you mean?

1115
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,440
And I was like, do you think he's right?

1116
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,200
He's like, I don't understand the question.

1117
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,120
I was like, do you think if that hadn't have happened,

1118
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,560
GDP would be 4.7% lower?

1119
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,840
He was like, I don't know what you mean.

1120
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,800
And this guy, he is not analyzing the economy.

1121
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,840
He's writing fucking papers.

1122
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,520
He doesn't care if it's right.

1123
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,360
He doesn't even think about whether it's right.

1124
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,360
I asked him once, why do you think people have not

1125
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,960
been spending money since 2008?

1126
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,720
And he said, I'm not really sure,

1127
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
but I think it's because of an exogenous shock

1128
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,080
to consumption savings preferences.

1129
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,160
And yeah, I've asked a lot of people,

1130
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,760
nobody ever told me that was fucking why.

1131
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,400
You know what I mean?

1132
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,520
And I think-

1133
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,880
But maybe they said it in other words,

1134
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
which is there was this global financial crisis,

1135
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,720
which then changed people's consumption habits.

1136
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,920
The more you understand what that means,

1137
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,840
the madder it is, because an exogenous shock

1138
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,240
is a technical term referring to economic modeling.

1139
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,320
It means something happened outside of our model.

1140
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,880
All right?

1141
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,960
And I've asked him something about the real world,

1142
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,840
and his answer is something changed outside the model.

1143
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,960
That is fucking insane.

1144
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,560
That is an insane thing to say.

1145
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,560
And a professor should be ashamed to say something like that.

1146
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,000
So he's saying the global financial crisis

1147
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,040
was an exogenous shock.

1148
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,440
Exactly.

1149
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,520
So you cannot describe things in the real world

1150
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,560
as exogenous shocks.

1151
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,640
That means something outside the model changed.

1152
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,320
Well, no, for instance, you could say in the early 1970s,

1153
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,680
you have a massive rise in inflation

1154
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,040
because there is an exogenous shock,

1155
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,960
which is the global oil crisis.

1156
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,200
Yeah.

1157
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,400
But you say what the shock is.

1158
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,560
Yeah.

1159
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,480
You know, it happened because of the oil crisis.

1160
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,160
Okay, something over there changed.

1161
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,240
Yeah.

1162
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,160
But you can't just describe a real world change

1163
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,440
as an exogenous shock in general.

1164
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,760
What if something changed on fucking Jupiter or Mars?

1165
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,720
So you're just saying long words

1166
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,760
because he didn't really have a proper explanation.

1167
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,240
And this is-

1168
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,360
And the problem is he-

1169
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,320
But the first is obfuscating his own lack of knowledge.

1170
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,720
But the biggest problem is he thinks that's a legit answer.

1171
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,320
And that is the problem when you have people

1172
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,640
these guys live so much in the models

1173
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,760
and care so little about the real world

1174
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,880
that they don't even realize

1175
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,560
that they're talking about models anymore.

1176
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,840
You need to be coming to grips with the real world

1177
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,040
and what is happening in the real world.

1178
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,280
And this is why I get frustrated

1179
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,680
about the lack of sort of class representation in economics

1180
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,840
because they can get away with that

1181
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,920
because they're fucking rich and they don't get hurt.

1182
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,160
You know, whereas it's my mates who fucking lose

1183
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,880
their fucking homes.

1184
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,080
It's interesting.

1185
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,000
I remember having a sort of interaction

1186
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,600
with an economist recently.

1187
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,600
Actually, I think he was formerly at the Bank of England.

1188
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,240
I can't remember what it was.

1189
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,080
He was on some subcommittee.

1190
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,840
He wasn't like a big cheese

1191
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,560
but he's a relatively sort of esteemed economist.

1192
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,800
And I think I said some throwaway remark like

1193
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,840
somebody says something about growth

1194
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,040
and I said, mate, it's a little crap.

1195
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,920
Go down a high street.

1196
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,520
You know, I live in Portsmouth.

1197
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,720
Like I go down the town center, city center,

1198
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,160
I can tell you all born with where I'm from.

1199
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,280
We ain't growing and we're not going to see

1200
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,680
real meaningful economic growth for a long time.

1201
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,160
And he said, well, that's literally why we have economics.

1202
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,600
So we don't have to like go down the street

1203
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,640
and see what's going on.

1204
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,120
Oh my God.

1205
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,280
But what's crazy is the Bank of England

1206
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,240
even has methodologies which include survey data

1207
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,720
going to talk to people and saying, how do you feel?

1208
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,920
We have, you know, survey data about consumer confidence,

1209
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,680
business investment confidence.

1210
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,680
But like you say, like they just think it's the models

1211
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,880
and like this is reality.

1212
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,200
And the actual living organism out there

1213
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,040
where we do these transactions in real life,

1214
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,640
that's just, I'll forget about it.

1215
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,280
That doesn't matter.

1216
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,880
Yeah, but what's the point?

1217
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,120
You know, I always remember when Russell Brand was

1218
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,760
getting involved in the pot.

1219
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,440
And a lot of my mates from back home like Russell Brand.

1220
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,880
He's from not far where I'm from, right?

1221
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,440
When he was, and he went on Newsnight.

1222
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,080
And at that time it was E15 Mums.

1223
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,040
You remember E15 Mums?

1224
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,120
A bunch of Mums in Stratford too were losing their homes

1225
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,960
and were getting kicked out of the area where they lived.

1226
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,640
And he'd spoken to them and he went on

1227
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,760
and he spoke to, it was Evan Davis at BBC.

1228
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,960
And I thought he gave quite like a emotional like,

1229
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,720
you know, a genuine like belief,

1230
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,920
like the plight of these people,

1231
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,280
look what's happened to these people.

1232
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,040
And Evan Davis turned around and showed him a 150-year graph

1233
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,680
of per capita wage growth.

1234
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,440
150-year graph, right?

1235
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,720
Which is, and it's an average, right?

1236
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,440
It's an average, right?

1237
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,600
So that could be dragged up by the super rich, right?

1238
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,960
And he showed him this graph and he said,

1239
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,640
well, you know, I can see what you're saying,

1240
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,680
but look, you're wrong.

1241
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,680
I've shown you this 150-year graph and it's,

1242
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,040
this, that is sickening to me.

1243
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,240
That is sickening to me.

1244
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,520
Because here's a guy who's telling you,

1245
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,360
look, people from where I'm from are losing their homes.

1246
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,320
And the guys turn around and say,

1247
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,640
well, actually I've done the fucking numbers

1248
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,920
and it's, everything's fine.

1249
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,440
And you know, Evan Davis can say that to me

1250
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,120
because I've got fucking two economics degrees

1251
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,320
and I can turn around to him and say,

1252
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,280
well, that's a fucking average.

1253
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,440
Who fucking cares if it's just a bunch of fucking millionaires

1254
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,160
dragging it up?

1255
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,120
Doesn't help my mates.

1256
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,400
Doesn't help the E15 mums.

1257
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,440
What was that?

1258
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,480
That's a fucking comedian.

1259
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,000
You can't show him 150-year graph.

1260
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,320
It's fucking-

1261
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,520
Was that, what was it, GDP?

1262
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,080
What was it?

1263
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,840
It was what per capita wage growth, I think.

1264
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,600
And you can find, you can go over and look at it on YouTube.

1265
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,040
But I mean-

1266
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:31,680
But that's the force.

1267
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,720
So it's like, look,

1268
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,840
after you get the Industrial Revolution

1269
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,040
for the first 40, 50 years,

1270
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,120
there isn't actual meaningful improvements

1271
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,000
and living standards.

1272
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,320
That only happens when you get industrial actions,

1273
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,920
strikes, revolutions, riots,

1274
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,680
because they're all in class, realize,

1275
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,200
okay, well, we can't do this forever.

1276
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,000
And the thing is, Evan Davis will know something like that.

1277
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,200
It's called, you know, it's called the Engels Paws.

1278
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,480
It's named after Frederick Engels.

1279
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,640
Interestingly enough, we're going to the next question.

1280
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,200
Evan Davis was one of the people who pioneered

1281
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,080
the poll tax policy.

1282
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,880
And if you know that-

1283
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,600
I didn't know that.

1284
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,400
Yeah, he did.

1285
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,080
Just raising him my estimation even more.

1286
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:00,800
Yeah, he worked.

1287
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,640
He worked in a think tank in the late 80s.

1288
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,840
I can't remember which one it was.

1289
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,720
So I won't say,

1290
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,120
but it's one of these sort of pro-Proththrite think tanks.

1291
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,120
And he was one of the minds behind the poll tax policy,

1292
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,920
which is one of the most unpopular economic policies

1293
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,200
in the history of this country.

1294
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,360
And now he's just viewed as sort of some centrist,

1295
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,920
you know, clever BBC political economics finance voice.

1296
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,680
I mean, it shows you how extreme those voices really are.

1297
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,000
Let's talk about the Tori Minay budget.

1298
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,040
Yeah.

1299
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,480
Which became this massive news story.

1300
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,560
People who are watching this probably heard,

1301
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,760
I know what guilt are,

1302
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,960
but I don't talk about them very often.

1303
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1304
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,480
They heard lots of words like guilt for the first time.

1305
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,840
Just kind of briefly explain what actually happened.

1306
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,800
Okay, so let's break it down from basics.

1307
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,240
So the very first thing is they announced

1308
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,400
a big package of spending and also tax cuts.

1309
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,840
The big thing which wasn't expected was

1310
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,760
they had this cut of the 45p rate,

1311
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,200
which the first thing to say is

1312
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,760
that rate kicks in at 150 grand.

1313
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,600
It doesn't affect you through an 150 grand

1314
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,440
because it's only above 150 grand.

1315
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,320
So really, you're only significantly cutting tax

1316
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,040
on people who earn like 200, 300, 400 at grand

1317
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,920
or a million pound a year.

1318
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,720
So it's a big tax cut specifically for very high earners.

1319
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,560
Markets weren't expecting that.

1320
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,560
And traders looked at that and the next thing to say is,

1321
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,040
you know, these were unfunded tax cuts.

1322
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,600
So what that means is the government is planning

1323
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,640
to borrow that money.

1324
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,960
So, you know, it means we're getting less money in.

1325
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,880
We're having to spend more money on things like energy.

1326
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,920
We're going to borrow the difference.

1327
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,080
And when you borrow money,

1328
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,360
when the government borrows money,

1329
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,400
it doesn't just come out of thin air.

1330
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,200
They borrow it from people, essentially from rich people

1331
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,040
and those decisions of whether to lend it or not

1332
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,920
are made by traders.

1333
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,480
And the traders look at the government and they think, well,

1334
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,560
you know, COVID's finished now

1335
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,960
and we're in more ordinary economic times

1336
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,360
and you're planning to run a massive deficit

1337
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,200
just to stuff rich people's pockets with cash, right?

1338
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,480
And, you know, if you're going to run massive deficits

1339
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,080
in normal times, you know, you don't have to be a genius

1340
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,680
to be like, well, how are you going to pay that?

1341
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,640
Back then, basically.

1342
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,200
And traders basically thought, okay, well,

1343
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,720
this is not a coherent plan.

1344
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,520
So probably one of two things will happen.

1345
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,480
You're a student of history.

1346
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,000
You'll know that historically,

1347
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,240
when governments have borrowed massive amounts of money,

1348
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,120
the way they've paid it back normally is through inflation.

1349
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,800
So if you have very high inflation,

1350
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,440
prices go up, price go up, wages also go up

1351
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
and your tax take rises significantly.

1352
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,960
The debt stays the same size

1353
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,640
because it's fixed in nominal terms.

1354
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,320
And then it's easy to pay back.

1355
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,760
That's how the Second World War debt was paid back.

1356
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,600
So traders are looking at this thinking, well,

1357
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,720
they're not serious about paying it back.

1358
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,400
So maybe they're going to inflate it away.

1359
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,000
Not only that, but they're given a crap ton of money out.

1360
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,200
So that's going to cause inflation.

1361
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,200
So they start selling the pound

1362
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,080
because you don't want pounds.

1363
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,520
It's going to be inflation, right?

1364
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,440
You know, it basically means the pound is worthless.

1365
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,640
You can't get as much for it.

1366
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,840
They start selling the pound.

1367
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,720
The pound starts falling.

1368
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,080
The Bank of England, whose job is to keep inflation at 3%,

1369
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,560
look at that and they say, okay, number one,

1370
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,000
government's giving a crap ton of money out.

1371
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,880
Number two, pounds falling,

1372
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,120
which means our import's going to cost them all.

1373
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,960
The inflation situation is looking even worse.

1374
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,520
So people are looking at the Bank of England and thinking,

1375
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,560
okay, they're going to raise rates massively.

1376
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,000
And this is in the context of already,

1377
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,880
even before the budget,

1378
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,600
we're talking about rates going up to five, five and a half percent.

1379
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,880
So suddenly they're thinking, okay,

1380
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,680
maybe it's going to go up to six and a half, seven percent.

1381
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,080
And if you know the Bank of England's going to raise rates,

1382
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,760
then you're not going to lend to the government

1383
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,200
unless you can get a similar rate, right?

1384
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,600
You know, I'm not going to lend to the government for zero

1385
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,080
if I can get four or five percent from the Bank of England.

1386
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,440
So suddenly the Bank of England,

1387
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,280
the government bonds all go up to four and a half percent.

1388
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,960
And this creates a panic, basically,

1389
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,120
because everybody starts selling the government bonds.

1390
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,600
Pension funds, a lot of people's pensions

1391
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,480
are invested in government bonds.

1392
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,360
They start collapsing.

1393
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,920
And it basically just creates a broad market panic

1394
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,600
because traders are looking at the government

1395
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,480
and thinking they don't have a plan.

1396
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,680
They don't have a plan.

1397
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,720
They're not going to pay the debt back.

1398
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,240
Oh, they're going to inflate it away.

1399
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,000
The central bank's going to raise rates.

1400
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,640
People start thinking,

1401
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,240
well, if rates got to five, six, seven percent,

1402
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,680
what does that mean for mortgages?

1403
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,520
You know, I think this is the big question, right?

1404
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,280
You know, if the Bank of England rate goes up,

1405
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,640
your mortgage will go up.

1406
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,720
And you know, we all know how big mortgages are,

1407
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,520
especially in London,

1408
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,800
but also in the rest of the country.

1409
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,520
And if you can fund that two percent, fine,

1410
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,800
but can you fund it at 10 percent?

1411
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,400
Can you fund it at 8 percent?

1412
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,760
Well, there's this amazing data, isn't there,

1413
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,640
which says basically, obviously,

1414
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,320
people love to talk about 1990, 15 percent interest rates,

1415
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,720
but because obviously house prices are so much higher now,

1416
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,320
people have got much larger mortgages,

1417
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,200
actually interest rates at five, six percent now

1418
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,360
would feel like 15 percent in 1990.

1419
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,680
Yeah.

1420
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,160
And this seems kind of lost on a lot of analysis.

1421
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,280
Yeah, people need to, yeah, exactly.

1422
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,880
You know, house prices are a lot,

1423
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,400
a lot higher now than they were in the 80s.

1424
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,360
And you know, the reality of the situation

1425
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,720
is a lot of people,

1426
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,160
even people who are not that poor,

1427
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,440
are going to be brought into situations

1428
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,640
where they can't pay the mortgage.

1429
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,680
You know, a lot millions of people, you know, that's,

1430
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,280
and then you start questioning, you know,

1431
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,360
the economy of the whole country.

1432
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,800
You know, it's these guys and the maddest thing of it all

1433
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,080
is this situation was created simply to the government

1434
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,920
to give a tax cut to millionaires.

1435
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,560
And it's one of the maddest things I've ever seen.

1436
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,080
And it created this carnage.

1437
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,760
Eventually the Bank of England was forced to come in

1438
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,640
and agreed to start lending money to the government again.

1439
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,720
You know, there's talk about is this QE, is this not QE,

1440
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,880
but the Bank of England eventually came in

1441
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,800
and backstopped the bonds, the government bonds,

1442
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,320
start lending money to the government.

1443
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,000
And you know, I talked to traders and they're looking

1444
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,440
at the government and they're just thinking,

1445
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,040
what are these guys playing?

1446
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,200
It's such a fuck up.

1447
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,960
You know, I think a lot of people think,

1448
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,680
oh, this was the plan.

1449
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,480
This was not the plan.

1450
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,760
This was not the plan.

1451
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,680
I think they thought they'd get away with it.

1452
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,720
And yeah, they couldn't.

1453
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,000
But you know, even now they've basically backed away,

1454
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,040
you know, the U-turned on it.

1455
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,320
And I predicted they would U-turn.

1456
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,440
I put a video on Sunday.

1457
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,280
The reason I predicted that U-turn, by the way,

1458
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,000
is because I started-

1459
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,360
It's on the 45P top rate.

1460
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,880
On the 45P top rate.

1461
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,560
It's because I started getting texts from people.

1462
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,480
I don't get texts from, you know, like,

1463
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,280
I live in these worlds now, you know, I'm writing a book

1464
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,640
and I'm in this sort of publishing world,

1465
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,320
you know, I'm in the media world now.

1466
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,400
I'm getting texts from people who are not poor,

1467
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,000
saying this policy's fucked.

1468
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,440
And it's because they've got mortgages, right?

1469
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,640
You know, they've got massive mortgages.

1470
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,560
A lot of people who are not poor have got big mortgages.

1471
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,920
It's not the poorest people who have the mortgages,

1472
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,040
because they can't get mortgages, right?

1473
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,760
Yeah.

1474
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,600
And you know, these guys work in the media.

1475
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,520
They were, and you know, even these guys, some of them,

1476
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,480
you know, I guarantee you, those Tory-backed benches,

1477
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,240
they or their kids have got mortgages.

1478
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,960
You know, so what the Conservative government did here,

1479
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,960
you know, you know, I don't need to tell you,

1480
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,360
these guys have been hurting the poor for a long time.

1481
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,160
But suddenly they took this big step to hurt homeowners.

1482
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,600
And you know, a lot of people in the media are homeowners,

1483
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,160
and I just thought the media is not going to accept this.

1484
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,600
And if the media doesn't, you know,

1485
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,320
they need the media to go with it for it to happen.

1486
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,120
The media wouldn't accept it.

1487
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,480
They're going to have to back down it.

1488
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,200
Eventually they did.

1489
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,960
Well, that's the big difference to austerity, isn't it?

1490
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,040
And that's kind of what frustrates me the most with this stuff,

1491
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,760
is that after 2010 to 2015,

1492
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,840
the bottom 25% of this country were destroyed.

1493
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,960
They were crushed.

1494
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,920
And the middle class, the upper middle class,

1495
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,480
like you say, if your height, you can be even ultra-rich.

1496
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,600
If you're highly leveraged on loans for property,

1497
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,120
you might be a buy-to-let landlord or whatever,

1498
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,880
you're terrified by all of this, right?

1499
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,360
And they got a glimpse of that.

1500
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,600
And within a week, it was just amazing to see

1501
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,800
how radicalized they became.

1502
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,160
And it's like, welcome to reality for the rest of the country, right?

1503
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:24,640
Yeah.

1504
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,920
But I think this is kind of,

1505
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,560
you know, the rich have got unbelievably richer in the last 15 years.

1506
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:38,960
And personally, I think that the conservative party is basically behind this.

1507
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,720
But there comes to a point where you've cut everything,

1508
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,880
you know, the welfare state is cut to a bare minimum.

1509
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,960
If they cut that back further, it's going to be,

1510
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,920
and it looks like they might,

1511
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,120
you're going to see real, it's going to be bad, right?

1512
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,800
And it's difficult to cut stuff there.

1513
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,600
But then how do you make the rich richer?

1514
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,960
How do you keep making the rich richer?

1515
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,320
And, you know, the only assets left

1516
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,960
are the houses of the middle class now, you know?

1517
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,960
So it comes to a point where, you know,

1518
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,240
you need to hit those people

1519
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,920
if you want to make the rich richer anymore, you know?

1520
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,520
Because the economy is not growing.

1521
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,320
So the only way the rich get richer is taking assets from the rest of us.

1522
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,520
And you know, we've cut their taxes,

1523
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,280
we've cut, you know, government services.

1524
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,720
And now I think the conservatives are in this bind

1525
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,760
where it's like, how do you keep that machine going

1526
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,200
without hitting your core voter base, which is homeowners, you know?

1527
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,560
And I think they're, I think they're really stuck here because,

1528
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,440
you know, they, the only thing you can do here

1529
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,280
to prevent an economic collapse is tax the rich.

1530
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,040
And it's like their reason to be that they can't do that.

1531
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,400
So I think that they tried this thing,

1532
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,520
which is, well, why don't we, if you look at it,

1533
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,120
in a sense, it's a clever strategy, right?

1534
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,480
Because it worked in COVID.

1535
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,400
Give ordinary families a bit and the rich a lot.

1536
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,800
But the problem is, and I think this is like a great irony

1537
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,320
and something, you know, people who are on the left,

1538
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
such as yourself or myself should ask ourselves,

1539
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,960
the people who stopped that, it wasn't us, it was financial markets.

1540
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,040
And we need to be sending that message.

1541
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,120
Look, they are taking your assets

1542
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,040
and giving it to the rich and they're making you poorer.

1543
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,920
And you know, I think this is an opportunity

1544
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,800
because the conservatives need that wedge to be

1545
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,240
between the middle and the poor.

1546
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:14,720
Yeah.

1547
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,160
They need that wedge to be there.

1548
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,400
But at the same time, there's nothing left to take from the poor.

1549
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,600
So, you know, we need to convince the middle,

1550
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,760
look, these guys are not going to help you in the long run.

1551
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,120
You know, where your kid's going to live?

1552
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,400
How's your kid going to afford a house?

1553
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,520
Where your grandkids going to live?

1554
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,000
Yeah.

1555
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,800
You know, we, and we need to make the explanation,

1556
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,200
look, I know they're giving you money,

1557
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,280
but they're giving the rich a ton of more money

1558
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,920
than they're giving you.

1559
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,120
And that will make you poorer.

1560
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,360
We need to build that understanding.

1561
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,120
What I think is ironic is sort of,

1562
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,680
the riot has sort of built itself on economic credibility

1563
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,560
and like the empowerment of individual.

1564
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,200
And yet they are destroying the financial lives

1565
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,160
of ordinary families.

1566
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,040
And I think it's a great failing of us

1567
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,200
that we haven't managed to explain to ordinary families

1568
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,920
how bleak their future is on this path.

1569
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,080
And that's, you know, that's what I try to do on my YouTube.

1570
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,160
That's like my sort of mission to explain, look.

1571
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,480
And then, so I think it's, where we are now is bad,

1572
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,440
but that creates this opportunity to build

1573
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,400
this broader coalition that unites the middle

1574
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,720
and poorer people and says, look,

1575
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,680
this doesn't work for any of us.

1576
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,760
One of the most frustrating things for me, though,

1577
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,720
is people are saying, this is the Tories.

1578
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,400
And then when Labour come back in, you know,

1579
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,520
things will be fantastic.

1580
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,160
Some things will be obviously be significantly better.

1581
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,160
But like you say, our economic model

1582
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,880
is about generating revenues for a certain group of people.

1583
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,720
They're looking around for sources of wealth.

1584
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,720
What are they, NHS?

1585
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,320
And like you say, the housing assets

1586
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,680
of the middle class in this country,

1587
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,160
and they will gobble them up because that's how it works.

1588
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,760
Whoever the government is,

1589
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,280
that's where the pressure will come from.

1590
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,520
Housing, 2023, since we're talking about it.

1591
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,800
What's going to happen to the housing market?

1592
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,240
You said that you were right when

1593
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,800
Larry Elliott was wrong about house prices during COVID.

1594
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,680
What happens next year?

1595
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,600
So I'm actually quite confident,

1596
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,120
and most people won't agree with me on this,

1597
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,760
that in the medium to long term, house prices will go up.

1598
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,680
And the reason for that is because

1599
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,600
the government's giving a ton of money out,

1600
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,360
and that money's ending up with the rich,

1601
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,440
and that will, you know, rich will buy assets

1602
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,960
and that will push broadly assets up.

1603
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Obviously in the short term, we've got massive headwinds,

1604
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,200
which is this massive increase in interest rates.

1605
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,040
So I think in the short term, anything could happen.

1606
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,120
I actually think, so I was of the opinion

1607
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
that interest rates would come back down

1608
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,200
because ordinary families, you know,

1609
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,520
the bottom 70, 80% are being so squeezed

1610
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,440
by what's happening that they will not be able to spend,

1611
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,520
and that means inflation will be quite short lived,

1612
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,120
and that means the rates will come back down.

1613
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,200
But then what I saw was that the government

1614
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,240
is planning to fix that by running another massive deficit.

1615
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,520
And you know, I know you know your history.

1616
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,000
This has happened before, right?

1617
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,760
If the government gives out a ton of money,

1618
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,440
that creates inflation, and they try to deal with it

1619
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,880
by giving out a ton of money,

1620
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,800
that does not bode well for long term inflation

1621
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,240
and the long term value of the currency.

1622
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,280
So I sort of started to think, well, actually maybe

1623
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,360
we could enter a bit of a spiral here

1624
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,680
where inflation stays high and interest rates stay high.

1625
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,640
But then what happened is the market rejected that.

1626
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,960
So I think it depends on what the government does.

1627
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,760
And unfortunately, both outcomes are bad, right?

1628
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,480
If the government decides to just churn money out,

1629
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,480
which ends up going, ending up with the rich,

1630
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,920
then you will see a big rise in interest rates

1631
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,200
and a big rise in inflation.

1632
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,480
And that causes this kind of conflict, right?

1633
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,480
Because in the long run, assets have to go up,

1634
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,240
but people can't get mortgages.

1635
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,320
And I think what that would lead to in the end is basically,

1636
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,280
people who have used mortgages

1637
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,680
will have to sell their houses to the people who have the cash.

1638
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,320
Because I mean, you and I sit here and you think,

1639
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,200
oh, interest rates go up, that makes it harder to buy a house.

1640
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,440
A ton of people don't need a mortgage to buy a house nowadays,

1641
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,080
because the really rich are stacking up so much cash.

1642
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,920
And they are the guys who get paid

1643
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,760
the high rates of interest on this cash.

1644
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,040
But now it looks more likely, and this is very up in the air,

1645
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,320
we don't know what the government's going to do,

1646
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,680
that they're going to move towards a kind of austerity light model.

1647
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,440
And I think that will probably take us,

1648
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,400
if they do that to a more post-2008 situation,

1649
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,560
where it's immiseration for ordinary people.

1650
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,880
Inflation will eventually come down,

1651
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,920
because the middle class has their spending power so badly hit.

1652
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,520
And house prices end up going up,

1653
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,880
because the rich have so much money,

1654
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,040
and they need, they want assets,

1655
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,800
they want to buy things with that money.

1656
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,400
And I think that's the bigger risk,

1657
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,080
because I think people don't realize how much it,

1658
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,560
a lot of people in the middle of society economically,

1659
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,880
don't realize how much it hurts their family,

1660
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,920
especially the kids and their grandkids,

1661
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,880
when house prices go up.

1662
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,920
I think that is the risk,

1663
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,160
but medium to long term,

1664
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,160
I'm very confident that house prices will go up.

1665
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,920
And that's a very, that's a very anti-consensus view at the moment.

1666
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,720
But the fact is, and this is the thing people keep missing,

1667
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,400
and have missed this at the beginning of COVID,

1668
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,680
the rich are stacking up so much cash here,

1669
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,040
and they're not going to sit on it.

1670
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,000
They're going to use it to buy assets.

1671
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And I think one thing that will have to happen,

1672
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,240
is the government will end up being forced

1673
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,920
to relax mortgage requirements, because...

1674
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,800
We're all doing this, right?

1675
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,480
That's why 50 year mortgage products and whatnot.

1676
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,520
They need to keep people being homeowners,

1677
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,440
but they also want to make the rich richer.

1678
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,280
Well, how do you do that, bigger mortgages?

1679
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,200
Then you can own your home technically,

1680
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,440
you own your 800, 900 grand home,

1681
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,520
but you also owe 800 grand debt to the rich.

1682
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,840
So you've got the home, but they've got the actual wealth.

1683
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,920
So I think that will happen.

1684
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,920
And I think the way that we fight that,

1685
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,360
is we have to make this connection between the distribution

1686
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,120
and the quality of life of ordinary people.

1687
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,320
We have to make that connection,

1688
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,560
because if we don't make that, people's lives get worse,

1689
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,760
and they don't understand why.

1690
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,720
They're like, well, I've got more money,

1691
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,320
my house price is going up, I should be richer.

1692
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,200
But if you are getting relatively poor art,

1693
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,640
then you will get less stuff.

1694
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,400
We've had in the last three years,

1695
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,080
the biggest and fastest ever increase

1696
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,600
in inequality in the country.

1697
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,280
And the biggest and fastest decrease

1698
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,280
in living standards in peacetime,

1699
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,640
and no one's connecting the two.

1700
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,120
And I think it's such an opportunity that we're missing.

1701
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,880
We need to say, look, you are getting poorer

1702
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,320
because of that increase in inequalities.

1703
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,800
It's not a complicated connection.

1704
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,960
You increase inequality, you improve their living standards,

1705
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,760
you decrease yours.

1706
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,800
I'm kind of surprised, actually,

1707
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,640
the middle class aren't more angry about it.

1708
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,120
Like, the people that shop at Waitrose,

1709
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,840
very affluent, looking to retire in a couple of years,

1710
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,280
there's many, many people like that who are very, very,

1711
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,240
I'm not saying they all vote Labour or Tory or Lib Dem,

1712
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,000
they do all three, or they don't vote at all.

1713
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,160
But they know that they're really

1714
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,880
fucking their kids and their grandkids.

1715
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,920
They know that.

1716
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,280
That's the connection we need to make.

1717
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,400
But they know that.

1718
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,880
Because there's polling out there, for instance,

1719
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,720
about should house prices fall?

1720
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,000
Which is really interesting.

1721
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,520
And actually, over 50% of the public

1722
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,440
say it would be in the public interest

1723
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,800
for house prices to fall.

1724
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,400
That doesn't mean they want house prices to fall

1725
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,080
because it's not necessarily in their rational self-interest,

1726
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,600
but they know what needs to happen.

1727
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,960
There's a lot of guilt out there, surely, amongst those people.

1728
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,000
You know there's this article,

1729
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,360
which always appears in the newspapers,

1730
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,880
which is how I bought a house by saving up

1731
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,160
and stop buying coffees.

1732
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,400
And famously, it always has, like, in there,

1733
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,720
and then I got 300 grand from my mum, like, hidden in there.

1734
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,080
Those articles, in my opinion,

1735
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,920
are to assuage the concerns of older property owners.

1736
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,920
Because older property owners,

1737
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,720
which is massively the voting base of the Conservative Party,

1738
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,760
have been to a large degree protected.

1739
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,640
You know, so, you know,

1740
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,680
my parents have always been poor,

1741
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,880
but they own their own property.

1742
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,240
And that means that, very likely,

1743
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,320
they'll be able to live to some degree comfortably

1744
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:20,960
until their retirement.

1745
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,640
They'll probably have to dissafe that property, right,

1746
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,600
and they'll lose the home.

1747
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,960
But they've been protected,

1748
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,480
even though they've been poor their whole lives, right?

1749
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,120
But if they were to look more broadly

1750
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,480
and to look at their kids and say,

1751
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,640
oh, well, you know, how are my kids going to be?

1752
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,320
They'd be like, they'd have to look realistically

1753
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,920
and be like, fuck, that's what they earn.

1754
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,960
That's the house prices.

1755
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,840
What's their pension?

1756
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,960
What's their retirement look like?

1757
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,640
How do I have elderly care?

1758
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,840
But people don't want to think about that.

1759
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,840
And then if the media tells you, well, listen, don't worry.

1760
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,000
You know what kids are like?

1761
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,880
They're a bit silly.

1762
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,760
They waste their money.

1763
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,200
They'll sort out.

1764
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,480
They'll stop buying the coffees.

1765
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,360
They'll stop buying that stuff.

1766
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,320
And they'll be okay.

1767
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,960
Those articles are there to tell.

1768
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,680
And, you know, it's easy to convince someone

1769
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,200
something they want to believe, right?

1770
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,440
Those guys grow out there and sell to older people

1771
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,880
that you're protected.

1772
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,320
And we know you might look bad for your kids,

1773
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:06,960
but don't worry.

1774
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,480
We've got that.

1775
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,600
They don't have that.

1776
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,880
And we need to counter that.

1777
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,120
And it's not easy because our message is,

1778
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,080
in some ways, unpalatable,

1779
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,360
which is if we stay on this path,

1780
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:16,800
your kids and your grandkids

1781
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,480
will have very, very difficult economic lives.

1782
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,880
But we need to make that case.

1783
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,120
And, you know, those are the people,

1784
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,240
in a sense, that we need to win.

1785
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,400
And, you know, it's their kids and their grandkids being hurt.

1786
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,840
And we need to find a way to communicate to them clearly

1787
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,680
and compassionately so they don't feel attacked.

1788
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,000
Look, we are trying to protect your kids and your grandkids.

1789
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,280
We're not attacking you.

1790
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,800
You know, where are your kids going to live?

1791
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,480
What is their life going to be like?

1792
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,400
Are your kids going to be able to afford to have kids of their own?

1793
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,040
You know, that is the message that I think we need to be making.

1794
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,080
If there's a young person watching this

1795
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,240
and they're thinking, I really want to get on the housing ladder,

1796
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,240
and then there's loads of calculations at play, right?

1797
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,600
Do I need to maybe move?

1798
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,800
Or should I prioritize, et cetera, et cetera?

1799
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,840
Presumably, you would still,

1800
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,880
it's not often on Navarro media,

1801
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,480
we talk about financial advice.

1802
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,320
But presumably, you would therefore say to them,

1803
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,840
given what you said five minutes ago about,

1804
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,920
you think house prices will continue to go up,

1805
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,040
that they should do that.

1806
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,600
I've been saying this, you know, consistently.

1807
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,480
If you can buy property.

1808
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,920
Don't wait for the market to go down.

1809
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,280
If you can do it, get on the ladder.

1810
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,640
If you can, if you can.

1811
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,880
Listen, if you don't have property,

1812
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,760
that's not a flat position,

1813
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,800
you're short one property,

1814
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,320
because you've got to live somewhere.

1815
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,160
You know, the first thing you should be looking to do,

1816
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,840
and I totally understand that in today's economy,

1817
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,080
that means taking 300, 400,

1818
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,640
if you're in London, 600, 700 grand of debt maybe.

1819
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,960
And that is risky, and that is unappealing.

1820
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,040
And I wish that we were not in that situation.

1821
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,440
But the truth is, if you don't own a property,

1822
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,560
you are in a very precarious financial position.

1823
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,040
And the best way you can get yourself out of that,

1824
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,160
is to get yourself a property.

1825
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,720
And you know, I wish that didn't mean

1826
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,160
taking a massive, massive mortgage.

1827
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,920
And I can't pretend to people

1828
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,520
that you're not taking a massive financial risk

1829
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,080
of buying a property.

1830
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,720
But the truth is, you are also taking a massive financial risk

1831
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,840
of not buying a property.

1832
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,440
Because look what's happening to rents.

1833
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,640
Look what's happening to their house prices.

1834
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,480
You know, there's people in London now,

1835
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,000
they don't even know where they're going to live.

1836
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,440
You know, and you know,

1837
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,360
if you don't have a property, you are short one property.

1838
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,680
You need to get that, just to make yourself secure.

1839
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:11,760
And I have to say when I say that, that I know,

1840
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,520
I know full world, that that is advice,

1841
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,800
that is impossible for a lot of people.

1842
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,600
And I understand that.

1843
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:15,920
Of course.

1844
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,440
But that is, you know, I have to tell people that,

1845
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:19,920
and it's true.

1846
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,480
And if you are in a situation where you can't,

1847
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,720
then you know, support me, follow my channel,

1848
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,560
people like you, so we can come out and explain,

1849
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,600
look, that it could be possible if we change things.

1850
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,520
I mean, I'll provide an example here.

1851
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,920
So I left, I left London because I'm with my now wife,

1852
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,040
because we wanted to have children.

1853
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,200
And we knew that we had to own somewhere

1854
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,360
to do that, because we, we couldn't,

1855
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,480
we'd love to rent if you had five year, 10 years,

1856
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,320
you didn't have a massive increase, et cetera,

1857
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,920
and kind of sort of security around housing

1858
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,360
that you say maybe have in Germany.

1859
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,400
We don't have that here.

1860
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,920
So we knew that we had to buy somewhere.

1861
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,520
That meant we had to move out of London.

1862
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,880
We did buy somewhere on the south coast.

1863
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:06,160
And doing that, just open my eyes so much as to,

1864
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,640
it's even worse than you think, if you're renting,

1865
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,840
how rigged the system is.

1866
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,640
The minute we accessed the mortgage,

1867
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,040
we didn't pay any stamp duty, that went.

1868
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,840
We then, that house in two years has gained more in value

1869
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,720
than I've earned working.

1870
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,600
We actually bought in a really good moment

1871
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,880
right at the beginning of the COVID crisis,

1872
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,680
where lots of, like I say, sort of student property developers

1873
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,040
just wanted to get rid of their assets, right?

1874
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,400
And I just feel like, and then as we're remortgaging,

1875
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,800
fortunately we remortgaged just before all this happened,

1876
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,320
you've got people saying, yeah, you can,

1877
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,680
you can borrow against the increase

1878
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,800
in the value of the house.

1879
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,440
And you think, this is nuts.

1880
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,520
And yet there are tens of millions of people in this country

1881
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,840
who think it's not normal, not acceptable, they're virtuous.

1882
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,280
And it's like, you keep on being rewarded for being lucky

1883
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,440
and then you get rewarded again and rewarded again.

1884
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,800
The people who actually down on their luck

1885
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,440
because they couldn't get the initial cash capital for the deposit,

1886
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,640
they keep on being punished.

1887
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,480
And I just feel like, how do we get that?

1888
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,880
I know renters know they're in a bad situation,

1889
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,200
but it's like, it's so much worse than you even realize.

1890
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,160
Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, my channel,

1891
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,160
it's mainly about sort of economics and politics,

1892
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,640
but we do do sort of, we talk about investing,

1893
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,760
we talk about buying property.

1894
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,560
And it's hard because I get so many messages like,

1895
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,720
you know, what can I do to make money?

1896
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,360
And the truth is like, you know, in the last years,

1897
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,600
we've seen this big increase in sort of crypto

1898
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,640
and online trading.

1899
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,000
And it sells this dream that you can sort of invest your way to wealth.

1900
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,520
But the truth is, you know, like, I live off of my assets,

1901
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,440
you know, I'm a wealthy individual, I live off of my assets,

1902
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,160
you know, if you come, if you come to me with like 500 grand,

1903
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,760
then if you make 5% a year, you can make 25 grand,

1904
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,800
you can live off that.

1905
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,560
If you come to me with 10, 15 grand, you make 5% a year,

1906
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,640
you know, you're never going to make 100 pound.

1907
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,560
You know, so it's sort of, this is, and the thing is,

1908
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,520
I want to tell people this, buy a property if you can,

1909
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,640
because it's good financial advice,

1910
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,320
but I just know it's impossible.

1911
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,640
And then that's why I think what is really interesting,

1912
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,880
you look at the journey that Martin Lewis has been on,

1913
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,800
my Lewis Money-Saving Expert, I guess people know,

1914
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,160
he's this guy that's like, protect your interests,

1915
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,080
do what's good for you, change your mortgage provider,

1916
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,360
change your electricity provider.

1917
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,240
And now he's coming out with, you have to fight the government.

1918
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,880
Because the problem is,

1919
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,160
they, the rich have all the money and all the assets,

1920
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,840
you are not going to beat them in that game.

1921
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:30,400
The only power you have, the only power you have is that there's more of you.

1922
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,840
And if you try and use that by trading crypto,

1923
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,720
you don't use that power.

1924
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,320
It's like the Kung Fu movies,

1925
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,240
where 100 guys fight Bruce Lee one at a time.

1926
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,240
We need to explain to people that being political

1927
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,520
is the best way to protect your financial interest

1928
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,600
as an individual, as a family, as a community,

1929
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,640
because it genuinely is, I genuinely believe that.

1930
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,920
And if you don't do that,

1931
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,480
and you know, this thing recently where we suddenly saw,

1932
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,440
a lot of nice, well-off people messaging me,

1933
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,960
oh, my mortgage rate's going to go up,

1934
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,400
and then the government backs down,

1935
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,440
that is what happened when you act politically as a community.

1936
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,960
You force government to change.

1937
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,720
And I also understand that a lot of people are struggling financially,

1938
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,360
and they struggle to have the energy to act politically.

1939
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,920
And you know, if you don't have anything to give,

1940
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,720
don't give anything.

1941
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,160
But if you have a little bit of space, a little bit of energy,

1942
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,600
you need to engage with this,

1943
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,200
because you are under attack,

1944
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,320
your houses are under attack,

1945
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,000
your living stands are under attack.

1946
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,560
And the only way to push back is to be political.

1947
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,560
And you know, I come from a poor background,

1948
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,240
and people where I grew up don't want to be political.

1949
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,320
But the truth is, this is what happens if you're not political,

1950
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,280
you know, there's a fight going on.

1951
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,560
If you don't fight it, you lose.

1952
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:47,440
Yeah. Going back to that thing about renting and homeownership,

1953
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,200
because of course, if you say, well, we need,

1954
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,160
and I believe this,

1955
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,560
we need house prices to go down at least 10%, 15%,

1956
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,480
and then stagnate, basically, for 20 years.

1957
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,400
And then somebody would say,

1958
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,160
well, that means that somebody who's just bought a property here,

1959
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,000
and there might be a young viewer of yours living in, I don't know,

1960
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,400
Leicester, right?

1961
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,000
And they've just bought a nice terraced house,

1962
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,720
nothing special, 230 grand,

1963
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,160
and they're going to go into negative equity.

1964
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,080
Okay, they go into negative equity,

1965
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,680
let's say for 18 months.

1966
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,280
I'd still rather be in their shoes,

1967
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,360
paying towards an asset,

1968
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,120
which at least in the medium to long term,

1969
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,240
is going to be making cash than renting.

1970
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,960
I don't understand how people think the negative,

1971
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,480
you say negative equity and people go,

1972
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,680
oh my God, they start panicking.

1973
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,160
Renting is much worse than negative equity.

1974
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,920
I was renting in London for 15 years,

1975
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,920
I lost about 85 grand renting,

1976
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,040
I've got nothing to show for it.

1977
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,040
And yet in the popular imagination,

1978
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,840
somehow negative equity is way worse than renting.

1979
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,880
Yeah, I think what I say is,

1980
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,440
the problem actually is the house price to wage ratio.

1981
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,720
If you think about it, that's the problem.

1982
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,480
That's gone up massively, 20 years ago, 30 years ago,

1983
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,840
that was like three or four,

1984
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,240
and now it's like in London, 20, 30 or more.

1985
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,960
So what you really want,

1986
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,360
you can fix the problem with that house price

1987
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,120
is coming down if you allow wages to rise.

1988
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,120
And I think what's interesting is in the last 20, 30 years,

1989
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,480
so we have the Bank of England,

1990
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,240
who have this mandate to keep inflation down.

1991
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,160
Except housing inflation.

1992
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,880
Exactly, it doesn't look at house prices.

1993
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,480
That inflation does not include house prices.

1994
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,200
So we have a mechanism that allows house prices to go up,

1995
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,600
but does not allow wages to go up.

1996
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,280
And because people want to avoid negative equity,

1997
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,640
we do not allow house prices to come down.

1998
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,480
So we've created an unfixable problem.

1999
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,160
If you allow house prices to go up,

2000
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,760
and you simultaneously will not accept

2001
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,240
falling house prices or rising wages,

2002
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,760
then that problem is unfixable.

2003
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,040
And I think we need to accept

2004
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,480
that we have a problem here,

2005
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,120
and we need to look realistically,

2006
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,280
why is this so big, and how do we bring wages up?

2007
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,520
In my opinion, the reason that

2008
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,200
this market has become so big

2009
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,440
is because the rich are so fucking rich now,

2010
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,880
and these guys buy assets.

2011
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,640
It's not just houses that have gone up,

2012
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,560
land prices gone up, stocks have gone up,

2013
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,840
luxury cars have gone up,

2014
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,000
luxury art has gone up, gold has gone up.

2015
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,800
Every single asset has rocketed in price

2016
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,640
because the rich are unbelievably rich.

2017
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,680
People need to understand,

2018
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,640
ultimately, there is a competition here

2019
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,440
for who owns the assets.

2020
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,800
And if you allow the rich to be unbelievably rich,

2021
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:05,920
think about it like this, right?

2022
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,640
Imagine you are, Elon Musk is a billion or whatever,

2023
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,920
but imagine you've got 100 million quid.

2024
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,480
Imagine that's your net worth, 100 million quid.

2025
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,920
You will make on that wealth

2026
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,200
about five million pounds a year.

2027
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,560
Let's say four.

2028
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,240
You make four million pounds a year

2029
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,120
just for getting out of bed.

2030
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:19,920
How much do you spend?

2031
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,760
Per day.

2032
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:22,800
Per year.

2033
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,600
I could live on 15 grand a year easily.

2034
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,200
Well, you're making four million pounds a year.

2035
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,400
Yeah, but honestly, I mean,

2036
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,160
as me, being a slightly 30 grand a year,

2037
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,520
40 grand a year easily.

2038
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,200
A sensible person would spend 200, 300 grand a year,

2039
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,560
live a life of luxury,

2040
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,720
and use the other 3.7 million pounds

2041
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,480
to buy more assets.

2042
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,120
That's what they do.

2043
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,960
And it's not that they're evil.

2044
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:43,840
I don't hate these people.

2045
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,720
They're not bad people.

2046
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,400
It's just, if you're super rich,

2047
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,920
you have a massive income.

2048
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,440
And it happens automatically.

2049
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,320
You just put it in the stock market.

2050
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,360
Those are the incentives.

2051
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,960
Yeah, you know, and that's so...

2052
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,720
You create this vacuum of wealth

2053
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,480
that sucks wealth out of ordinary family.

2054
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,920
So, of course, how's prices going to rise?

2055
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,280
Because they have got so much money,

2056
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,160
they're going to push it up.

2057
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:00,960
Let me ask you a question

2058
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:01,840
that I'm actually relating to this,

2059
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,600
because at Labour Party Conference,

2060
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,880
Keir Starmer outlined a policy,

2061
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,640
and he said he wanted home ownership

2062
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,480
to go from 65% to 70%.

2063
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,080
It was 70% in 2003.

2064
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,320
So, important to say, we've gone backwards, right?

2065
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,080
And that they would do this

2066
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:17,360
basically through some government-led mortgage scheme,

2067
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,440
presumably they would provide deposits to people.

2068
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,480
I don't know how they would do it.

2069
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,400
They could be subprime mortgages,

2070
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,760
presumably, which are backed by the state.

2071
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,400
I have no idea.

2072
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,960
That to me sounds like

2073
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,160
you're only going to further inflate

2074
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,040
the mortgage market, though,

2075
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,400
because, of course, going from 65% to 70% again

2076
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,800
means you've got massive increase in demand.

2077
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,640
Good, I'm happy to do that.

2078
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,240
But that doesn't sound like a solution to me,

2079
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,240
if you're saying we're going to help home ownership

2080
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,080
by increasing prices,

2081
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,400
and, again, they're going to out ship wage increases.

2082
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,880
I think this is what happens when you don't deal

2083
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,920
with the fundamental problem

2084
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,000
that inequality is increasing massively.

2085
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,760
You know, how do you keep people in homes

2086
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,360
when inequality is increasing massively?

2087
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,880
You know, if you have this constant flow of wealth and assets

2088
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,520
from ordinary families to the rich,

2089
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,720
then how do you keep them in their homes?

2090
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,920
The only way to do it,

2091
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,360
because homes are ultimately

2092
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,760
the largest form of wealth in the country,

2093
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,320
the only way to do it is have massive increase in debt.

2094
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,600
And this is, if you start looking

2095
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,960
for sort of technocratic solutions,

2096
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,080
this is what will happen.

2097
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,080
You'll just end up putting people into more and more debt.

2098
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,520
And I think that is what will happen.

2099
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,080
And we need, people need to understand

2100
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,160
that you cannot be rich without assets.

2101
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,280
And the current setup sees an enormous flow of assets

2102
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,800
and wealth and money every year

2103
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,400
from ordinary families to the rich.

2104
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,240
You know, you make 30 grand,

2105
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:34,000
you spend all of that on mortgage, rent, food, bills, energy.

2106
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,120
That money doesn't disappear.

2107
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,480
It goes to the owner of your house,

2108
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,520
the owner of your mortgage,

2109
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,200
the owner of the food, the owner of Tesco,

2110
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,720
the owner of the energy companies, right?

2111
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,080
You earn 30 grand, you give all of it to the rich.

2112
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,000
And it is that guy, Rishi Sunaki,

2113
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,520
he's worth 700 million pounds, right?

2114
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,520
You know, he will make every year,

2115
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,640
he'll make 20 million pounds on that every single year.

2116
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,800
And that's where your mortgage payment goes.

2117
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,960
You know, so if you create a system

2118
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,880
where there's this enormous flow of money,

2119
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,840
wealth assets from ordinary families to the rich,

2120
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,000
then year after year, generation after generation,

2121
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,560
ordinary families will get poorer.

2122
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,520
And this fundamentally needs to be fixed on it

2123
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,880
until we grasp this problem,

2124
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,560
life will get worse and worse.

2125
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,400
That is exactly why I do the job that I do.

2126
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,280
I don't need to do this.

2127
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,080
You know what I mean?

2128
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,120
I've made a lot of money

2129
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,160
and I could keep making more money.

2130
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,000
I could go live on a beach in the Philippines,

2131
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,760
but poverty will explode if we don't deal with this.

2132
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,040
Let's talk about deficits.

2133
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,480
It's a word that's not mentioned anymore.

2134
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,440
It was very common between 2010 and 2015.

2135
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,440
The Tories promised to eliminate the deficit by 2015

2136
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,400
when they came into government

2137
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,400
with the Liberal Democrats in 2010.

2138
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,160
We've been running a deficit since 2010.

2139
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,960
Actually, it's important to say,

2140
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,960
we've been running virtually permanent deficits

2141
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,320
since the late 1970s.

2142
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,520
For the Tories, quote unquote,

2143
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,400
balancing the books is always this big watchword.

2144
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,880
Are they ever going to balance the books?

2145
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,520
Which is to say,

2146
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,600
are they ever going to preside over a situation

2147
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,720
where actually they bring in more through general taxation

2148
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,560
than they spend through public spending?

2149
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,000
Because they promised to do that for years.

2150
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,880
It never happens.

2151
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,640
I think it will probably never happen.

2152
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,160
Okay, so, you know,

2153
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,760
lots of people have lots of strong opinions on this.

2154
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,320
Governments don't need to run surpluses.

2155
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,200
You can run a deficit.

2156
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,840
The reason is because deficits get eroded over time

2157
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,320
by both economic growth and by inflation.

2158
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,600
So, your debt is fixed in nominal terms.

2159
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,800
Inflation pushed all the prices up.

2160
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,240
So, if you have growth of,

2161
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,200
nowadays we don't get much,

2162
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,480
but if you get one, two percent,

2163
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,080
if you have inflation of two, three percent,

2164
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,760
then your deficit is naturally falling

2165
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,960
relative to the size of your economy by four or five percent every year.

2166
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,720
So, you can afford to run a four or five percent deficit over time.

2167
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:33,680
You can, if that's what you want.

2168
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,840
I'm not opposed to deficits at all.

2169
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:40,560
I think the last few years,

2170
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,400
I've seen some people sort of pushing this direction

2171
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,920
of let's run massive deficits.

2172
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,160
And I think the deficit in Corridor is necessary.

2173
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:52,400
I think the big problem that this sort of people saying

2174
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,760
let's run massive deficits is,

2175
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,040
it totally defangs people like me saying,

2176
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,400
let's tax the rich.

2177
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,840
Because if you turn around to me and say,

2178
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,280
there's no problem with deficits, even massive ones,

2179
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,400
why tax the rich?

2180
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,840
We just run a massive deficit.

2181
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,080
And then what you do is you politically enable

2182
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,640
things like COVID where a massive crisis

2183
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,400
led to a £600 billion wealth transfer to the rich.

2184
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,080
So, actually, you think the MMT people,

2185
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,440
the modern monetary theory people,

2186
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,720
they've got it completely wrong.

2187
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,560
They're providing the sort of intellectual foundations.

2188
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,720
If they're saying, and not all of them do say that,

2189
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,920
we need to run massive deficits.

2190
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,040
Don't worry about class struggle.

2191
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,400
Don't worry about inequality.

2192
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,560
Actually, what they're doing is providing a license to the transfer

2193
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,760
of wealth from poor to rich.

2194
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,960
I don't want to mischaracterize them

2195
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,480
because it's a big community and different people

2196
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,280
believe different things.

2197
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,080
And I think the high priests of it,

2198
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,840
the people who are really into it,

2199
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,800
often they will say, well, actually,

2200
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,880
MMT does support taxation of the rich.

2201
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,280
The problem is the message that has cut through

2202
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,640
is deficits are not dangerous.

2203
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,080
And the message that you need to tax the rich

2204
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,120
has not cut through.

2205
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,280
Because I talk about taxing the rich all the time

2206
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,680
and I frequently get people posting against me,

2207
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,680
you don't need to tax the rich, you don't understand money.

2208
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,280
So, there's no doubt about it

2209
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,280
that MMT has persuaded a lot of people,

2210
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,640
you don't need to tax the rich.

2211
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,840
And I think, and people disagree with this,

2212
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,840
but I think if you just print money

2213
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,440
and that money ends up with the rich,

2214
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,880
you will increase inequality

2215
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,480
and you will decrease living standards.

2216
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,320
Distribution matters.

2217
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:12,960
It matters.

2218
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:13,920
Of course it does.

2219
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,000
You can't massively increase inequality

2220
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,080
and not expect living standards to fall.

2221
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,760
And the last three years have shown exactly that happening.

2222
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,320
So, I think I'm not against deficits.

2223
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,200
Of course, I'm not pro austerity.

2224
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,960
And government can afford to run a deficit.

2225
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,120
But if you take your eye off of inequality

2226
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,440
and you say deficits are totally fine,

2227
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,840
we don't really care about what that does to inequality,

2228
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,920
you can't be surprised when the Tory government turns around

2229
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,720
and say, okay, well, we're going to tax ordinary people's taxes,

2230
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,960
we're going to cut ordinary people's taxes by 100 quid

2231
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,640
and the richest taxes by 50 grand.

2232
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,600
You've allowed that, right?

2233
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,360
You've allowed that because you've said to them,

2234
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,960
we're not going to fight you on running deficits

2235
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,560
and we're not going to fight you on inequality.

2236
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,800
So, they're going to run a deficit to increase inequality.

2237
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,960
So, I think deficits can be a tool in a certain time.

2238
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,240
Of course, the power is not unlimited.

2239
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,080
Of course, the power is not unlimited.

2240
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,320
But if you take your eye off the ball with inequality

2241
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,640
and with distribution, it will rise.

2242
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,840
You need to watch it.

2243
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,280
So, you're talking about taxing the rich,

2244
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,840
but we're often told that imposing higher taxes on profits,

2245
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,320
higher incomes would drive business away from the UK.

2246
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,360
What would your response to that be?

2247
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,840
So, the first thing is, I'm not talking about taxing incomes more.

2248
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,440
I'm talking about taxing wealth more.

2249
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,520
You can tax income less if you want, you know what I mean?

2250
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,840
And then you can attract high earners here if you want.

2251
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,160
But when we talk about driving people away,

2252
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:32,000
I think the one single only good thing to come out of this war in Ukraine

2253
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,680
is that the government turned around and suddenly decided

2254
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,120
they wanted to tax rich people.

2255
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,960
A very specific subset of rich people,

2256
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,160
which is Russian billionaires.

2257
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,800
And Roman Abramovich, who of course owns Chelsea Football Club,

2258
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,400
he fucking paid it because you cannot put Chelsea Football Club in a bag.

2259
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,800
You know, I think that idea rests on a perception of rich people

2260
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,080
as if they are guys with like a massive bag of cash, okay?

2261
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,800
Rich people are rich because they own your houses.

2262
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,680
They own your house.

2263
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,800
They own your mortgage.

2264
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,320
They own fucking Tescos down the road.

2265
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,360
They own the skyscrapers.

2266
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,720
They own the fucking windmills.

2267
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,520
They own the oil rigs.

2268
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,440
They own the fucking land that makes the food.

2269
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,680
They are rich because they own real assets.

2270
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,040
In this, they're rich because they own this country

2271
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,480
and they can leave if they want.

2272
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,280
The country will still be here and we can tax the assets

2273
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,040
where the assets are, which is here.

2274
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,080
You know what I mean?

2275
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,160
You know, Jeff Bezos owns Amazon,

2276
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:25,600
but Amazon sells to the UK, to the US, to Europe, to Japan.

2277
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,080
You know what I mean?

2278
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,120
You know, these guys can't just all move to the Cayman Islands.

2279
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,040
The assets are in the world.

2280
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,320
You know, they own real things and we can tax those real things.

2281
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,800
You know, ultimately it's a question of,

2282
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,720
do you want your country to be owned by people who pay tax or people who don't?

2283
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,800
You know, and it's, they can leave.

2284
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,680
The stuff is here.

2285
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,880
They own your mortgage.

2286
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,600
What are they going to do?

2287
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:49,040
You know, we can tax that payment when you make it.

2288
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,040
Ultimately, their money comes from you.

2289
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,760
Their money comes from when you, when you go to the supermarket,

2290
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,360
when you work, when you pay your bills,

2291
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,040
when you pay your mortgage, when you pay your rent.

2292
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,280
I think people need to, there's one video on my channel

2293
01:20:59,280 --> 01:20:59,920
called What Is World?

2294
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,320
You know, I'm going to just plug it because it's to explain,

2295
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,480
these guys are rich because they own assets.

2296
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,440
They own this country.

2297
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,640
Of course, we can tax it.

2298
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,640
And I think nothing shows that better than

2299
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:09,840
Roman Abramovich turning around,

2300
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,400
trying to sell Chelsea Football Club to the only one who's going to buy it.

2301
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,560
Because it's there.

2302
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,760
It exists and we can tax it.

2303
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,520
Why do you think Quasiquata and got rid of the Cap on Bankers bonuses?

2304
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,000
Because presumably the same argument there, right?

2305
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,160
Actually, it's a little bit different because that's not a tax.

2306
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,600
It wasn't actually raising money.

2307
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,160
They might actually make the argument it will raise more money

2308
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,720
because we'll have a larger financial service industry here.

2309
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,080
What was the thinking that you think?

2310
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,080
I'll be honest.

2311
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:39,600
The thing, I understood the economics of the budget very well in my opinion.

2312
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,680
The thing which I'm struggling to understand is why they did what they did.

2313
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,680
And the most people I speak to are struggling as well.

2314
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,480
And you know, some people say they're ideological.

2315
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,400
I'll be honest, a lot of people say that they're idiots.

2316
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,320
A lot of people in the markets genuinely think they're idiots.

2317
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,840
Quasiquating worked in markets.

2318
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,520
And everybody's saying, oh, I know this guy that worked with him.

2319
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,800
He said he was an absolute idiot.

2320
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,640
He's got PhD in economic history.

2321
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:01,200
Mind you, you've already said you've already rinsed academics.

2322
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,280
I couldn't tell you honestly.

2323
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,120
I think that he probably thinks that it will...

2324
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,560
Do you think he thinks it'll play well with a certain demographic?

2325
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:16,800
That he's trying to pitch himself as we are pro-growth and we are pro-dynamism.

2326
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,000
One thing I think is interesting about Banker, because I was a banker for a long time.

2327
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,960
I was very poor growing up, right?

2328
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,920
That is the kind of policy which you ask 15-year-old me,

2329
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,720
doing maths lying on the floor of his front room, you know what I mean?

2330
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,760
Who'll probably like it.

2331
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,320
You know what I mean?

2332
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:37,760
Because I'm poor and I see a system where people around me in London are millionaires

2333
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,880
and don't pay much tax.

2334
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,960
And I'm thinking, well, I want to get out that channel.

2335
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,000
Finance is aspirational, isn't it?

2336
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,760
For me, it was aspirational.

2337
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,320
You know what I mean?

2338
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:50,880
So I couldn't tell you for sure and I think it's fallen flat.

2339
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:57,200
But I think maybe he's trying to pitch himself as aspirational.

2340
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,880
That seems to be what they're going for as a brand.

2341
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,960
Would it play well with the sort of people you used to work with?

2342
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,080
Would they sort of hear that come through in the mini-budget statement

2343
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,240
at Citibank and go, fucking hell, brilliant.

2344
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,920
I'll tell you, I've got a good story about this.

2345
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:14,240
So I started working in 2008 and in 2009, I think it was in 2009,

2346
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:17,360
it was still a Labour government and they announced a big increase in tax on the banks.

2347
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,040
And I was shitting myself, right?

2348
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,960
Because I was still poor, I'd never been paid.

2349
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,040
You know, I had a job at a bank, but I didn't make any money yet.

2350
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,200
And I was like, fuck me, I'll work this hard to get here

2351
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,880
and now they're going to raise taxes on me.

2352
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,800
And I looked around me at the traders on the desk,

2353
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,920
they were fucking laughing.

2354
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,200
They were fucking laughing because they knew it wouldn't affect them.

2355
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,400
They knew it wouldn't affect them.

2356
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,520
And I remember this sort of, it's weird for someone like me

2357
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,120
who comes from a poor background to just see this confidence, this like,

2358
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,880
and that was a Labour government, right?

2359
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,480
This knowledge that, look, these guys, don't worry, we got them.

2360
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,000
They're going to come for us.

2361
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's just, it's just, it's for the people, you know, it's, you know,

2362
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,240
and, you know, the bank of bonus cap, in the reality of it is,

2363
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,800
all it led to was a massive increase in bank of salaries.

2364
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,080
You know, so it's a good example of a tax which is

2365
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,880
for your image, basically.

2366
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,080
It's a messaging tax because, you know, essentially it's not a tax,

2367
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,920
it's just a change in the structure of pay, you know.

2368
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,320
So I honestly think they probably don't really care.

2369
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:22,000
They understand that it's just, it's for messaging.

2370
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,720
It's for the conservative part in the way that they look.

2371
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,000
On the crypto thing, we mentioned it a bit earlier on.

2372
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,960
So tons of working-class guys and others as well,

2373
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,680
but it is a thing, as far as I can see,

2374
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,000
have sort of been sucked into crypto.

2375
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,520
Yeah.

2376
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,800
Are they being conned?

2377
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,800
You know, you're somebody that's interested in financial markets

2378
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,680
and assets and wealth, but the way it's being talked about

2379
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,320
and speculated on, particularly on social media,

2380
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,120
it seems a little bit more like a Ponzi scheme.

2381
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,160
Am I being unfair?

2382
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,760
Basically, in my opinion, yes.

2383
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,280
Listen, I live on my investments.

2384
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,400
I make investments.

2385
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,440
I'm an investor.

2386
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,640
If you want to invest in something, you should do a due diligence, okay?

2387
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,800
The number one thing that you should check before anything else,

2388
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,840
you probably should need to check it,

2389
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,520
is that the thing that you're buying fucking exists.

2390
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,360
You know, these guys, it's fucking internet points, mate.

2391
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,480
See, I'm going to get hate on this for the internet.

2392
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,280
That is what it is.

2393
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,240
It's internet points, you know?

2394
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,440
And I said this before this crash.

2395
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,560
I've been saying it for a long time.

2396
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,360
These guys are selling you fucking snake oil, you know?

2397
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,840
And they're going to take that money that you gave to them

2398
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,680
to buy their fucking dog coin,

2399
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,760
and they're going to buy your fucking mom's house.

2400
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,040
That is what they're going to buy with it.

2401
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,760
You know, you could be saving that money to buy houses,

2402
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,760
and they're selling you fucking points on the internet.

2403
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,760
And I understand it.

2404
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,760
I understand it, you know, because I've been there.

2405
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:36,480
I've been poor.

2406
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,800
You see the guys, oh, I'm making money trading, blah, blah, blah.

2407
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,960
And you know, all the guys who, you know,

2408
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,400
they're showing on their Instagram,

2409
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,600
I bought a Lamborghini with crypto.

2410
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,360
Listen, I've come out on crypto,

2411
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,800
so I get the messages from people, all right?

2412
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,920
The guys who fucking lost their fucking life savings

2413
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,160
trading crypto, they don't fucking post it on Instagram.

2414
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:53,520
You know?

2415
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,240
It's as simple as that.

2416
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,280
But they message me.

2417
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,520
They message me saying, oh, I've lost all my money.

2418
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,400
Can you give me some advice?

2419
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,840
I've got this new strategy.

2420
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,680
And I have to message them back saying, listen,

2421
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,560
you've got a problem.

2422
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,600
It's an addiction.

2423
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,840
My advice is that you'd never trade this ever again.

2424
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,360
And you know, and you come out,

2425
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,280
and you, once you speak out on it,

2426
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,560
you get these guys flooding to you,

2427
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,840
oh, I've lost all my fucking savings.

2428
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,000
And it's, you know, it's fucking gambling addiction, man.

2429
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,800
And it ruins, it ruins lives, it ruins family.

2430
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,480
And you know, also, you know, these people, I've been poor.

2431
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,400
I've been that fucking young, dumb, full of cum guy

2432
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,520
that wants to make a ton of cash.

2433
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,400
You know what I mean?

2434
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,520
I understand it.

2435
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,640
But these people, they should be our best fighters

2436
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,360
to make this fucking system better for ordinary families.

2437
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,560
The guys buying crypto.

2438
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,400
Yeah, because they're young, they've got energy.

2439
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,000
Listen, I'm getting older now, you know what I mean?

2440
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,080
I can't be out every day like pushing this, you know?

2441
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,840
But these guys, they're getting screwed over by the system,

2442
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,760
and then they're getting sold the fucking fake cure

2443
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,680
by the system that's taking all their money.

2444
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,760
Come here and help us build a system

2445
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,920
that will get you a fucking house, you know what I mean?

2446
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,920
And, and I know it's a seductive idea

2447
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,000
like you buy this coin, you can become a millionaire.

2448
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,200
And you know, I'm not telling you,

2449
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,520
if you follow my fucking YouTube, you'll be a millionaire.

2450
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,800
That's not gonna work like that.

2451
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,520
But if we lose this fight, you and your family will be fucked.

2452
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,280
I'm sorry. I don't want to say it like that.

2453
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,160
But that is what it is.

2454
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,120
You know, this is not a fight where the winners make millions.

2455
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,960
This is a fight for survival, you know?

2456
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,400
So I see-

2457
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:16,400
You would put crypto as a very discreet asset sort of class,

2458
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:21,280
which is nothing like, like you said, housing or land or gold.

2459
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,800
You wouldn't touch it with a barge pole.

2460
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,640
I'm short. The reason I'm short,

2461
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,560
people probably say I always send this shit because it's short.

2462
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,720
The reason I'm short is because I started to get asked

2463
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,240
to do a lot of interviews on crypto.

2464
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,880
And I went on TV and radio and said, I think it's bullshit.

2465
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:38,240
And, you know, I'm a big believer that you shouldn't say shit.

2466
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,760
You don't believe, okay?

2467
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,000
So if I'm going to say something on the radio,

2468
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,200
I've got my nuts on it, okay?

2469
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,720
I still trade every day, right?

2470
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,440
And the things that I say is going to happen, I'm betting on it.

2471
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,760
So I went, I opened up and I went short crypto, you know?

2472
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,320
I went short crypto just simply because-

2473
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,520
So explain what that means to our audience.

2474
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,120
It means I basically bet the price will go down.

2475
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,680
And if the price goes down, I made money and I've made some money on it going down.

2476
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,520
And I'm still short because I think it will still go down.

2477
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,160
I don't consider myself to be a crypto trader.

2478
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:06,560
I'm just saying that because, you know, opinions are cheap, okay?

2479
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,240
I've got my nuts on this.

2480
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,680
If it goes up, I'm going to lose money.

2481
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:10,880
So you know what I believe.

2482
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:11,600
That's what I believe.

2483
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,840
And, you know, I was one of the top traders in the world and I'm a very successful trader.

2484
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,920
People don't have to believe me, but that isn't,

2485
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,360
for me, that is a statement of intent.

2486
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,280
And look, I don't want to trade crypto.

2487
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,240
I think it's bullshit.

2488
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,760
And I think it takes away-

2489
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,400
I think it's sucking the life out of a lot of talented young people.

2490
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,080
And I've seen a lot of things do that in my time.

2491
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,560
And it's turning them into gambling addicts.

2492
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,120
And I'm being very harsh on it here and I know people are going to come at me.

2493
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,120
But I'm trying to save you money.

2494
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,680
But seriously, you know, I'm just telling you what I believe.

2495
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,720
You don't have to agree with me.

2496
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,440
But look, you know, we're losing our houses here.

2497
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,560
You're trading dog coins.

2498
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,640
Like you're going to play with us or you're going to play with that.

2499
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,360
That's the way I see it.

2500
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:48,960
Last question.

2501
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:55,120
You recently said, my grand macro thesis is that real interest rates have to stay low,

2502
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:55,680
as we've said.

2503
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,120
And that's because the rich have all the wealth and like saving, as you've said.

2504
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,960
Now, no matter how hard you work, how smart you are, if you come from, quote,

2505
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,080
the wrong family, you'll probably never own property.

2506
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,680
That is feudalism.

2507
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,560
We're going back into a world of aristocracy.

2508
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,000
Capitalism's over.

2509
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,600
So capitalism's over.

2510
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,160
What does that mean?

2511
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:15,920
So with quote, first of all-

2512
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,640
It's a great quote.

2513
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:17,600
That's why we're ending on it.

2514
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,920
When I say capitalism is over, I say capitalism is a big word.

2515
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,360
People have different ideas of what it means.

2516
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,160
Okay.

2517
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:27,120
But for me and for what I think a lot of people from where I'm from

2518
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:31,440
believe capitalism is or should be, is a system where if you fucking work hard

2519
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,800
and you're talented and you go through it and you do your best and you get the good degree

2520
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,720
and you get the good job and you hit it, you should not necessarily become super rich,

2521
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:43,040
but you should have there for you a nice, secure, comfortable life, house, family.

2522
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,120
If you want it, that's capitalism.

2523
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,720
That is the way, I know some people are not agree with that, but that is the way people

2524
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:52,560
where I'm from, I raise to believe that it's about a society where if you work hard,

2525
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,400
if you do the right thing, you will be quite actually secure.

2526
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,640
Yeah, that is what we are like raised to believe that we live in that kind of society.

2527
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:04,400
And I live in a world now where look, I've got a mate, he's a big fan of yours by the way,

2528
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,520
so we'll be happy to be mentioned.

2529
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,360
He works in fashion, smart guy, went to Central Saint Martin's big fashion school,

2530
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,480
works fucking hard, he lives with his, he owes good money now,

2531
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,680
he took him a long time to get there.

2532
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:17,520
He lives with his parents, saves up, saves up, saves up because he wants to buy a house.

2533
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,560
But the fucking house price has gone quicker than his fucking deposit does.

2534
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,160
And now mortgage has gone up, how's this guy going to get a house?

2535
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,960
This guy's done fucking everything you want him to do, you know what I mean?

2536
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:33,920
Studied, hard, best university, really gone for it, worked, worked, worked, saving up everything.

2537
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,440
This guy doesn't even know if he's ever going to be able to afford a family.

2538
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:43,120
So from, and at the same time, I've got friends buying houses because their mom gave him 400 grand.

2539
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,320
That's not fucking capitalism, that is an inherited society.

2540
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:51,120
We are moving away, you know, there was 30, 40, 50, 60 years where, you know,

2541
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,400
my dad worked for the post office, you know, I grew up, it's all Pakistanis and Indians

2542
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,200
where I grew up, right? Their grandparents came over from Pakistan,

2543
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:01,200
from India, from Kenya, right? Just worked in shops, you know, some of them are cleaners

2544
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,920
and they've got properties now, you know what I mean? They're secure now.

2545
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,960
That was possible in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and it is not possible anymore.

2546
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,640
We've got smart, bright, hardworking kids going to the best universities,

2547
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,880
doing everything they can and they will never own property.

2548
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,120
So when I say capitalism's over, that is what I mean because we have ended a society

2549
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,560
where ordinary people can expect to get a good quality of life for working hard.

2550
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,360
Gary, what a pleasure, mate. Thank you. Cheers.
