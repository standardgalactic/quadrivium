So this video is rather important because it discusses the future of employment and it's not
just a random person. This is from Avital Balwit and this is someone who actually works at the
Frontier Lab and Thropic and her insights into how the future of work and employment
is going to change are very important for individuals like yourself and of course me.
So I'm going to do a deep dive on this entire thing because I truly believe that this is really
important that you can stay ahead of the future. Now if you enjoy videos that are specifically
focusing on how you can use AI to better your life and of course preparing for AGI such as how to
invest in AI and benefit from the trillions of dollars that are flowing into the industry.
Don't forget to check out my post AGI Preparedness group. This is where videos like this actually
get uploaded a few days earlier but without wasting any more time let's get straight back
to the video because it's really important. So essentially this is a post about my last five
years of work. Now if you aren't understanding the significance of this trust me at least watch
the first 10 minutes because it's truly truly incredible. So essentially what we have here ladies
and gentlemen is a post by Avital Balwit and this is Anthropics Chief of Staff okay and this is kind
of like a personal reflection slash diary on how the next few years of you know the economy are
going to go for the average person in regards to work and where they fit into the economy
and how things are going to be working. Now the reason I'm covering this is because
I think this is probably one of the most remarkable insights that we are lucky to have to get
because a lot of these you know people at Frontier Labs they truly don't talk about how the future
of work is going to be. So it is something that I think is very very important for us to discuss
because this is something that is truly truly pivotal especially for this monumental period
of time. So there are four main things I'm going to timestamp them in the below but just take a
look at this. So she says I am 25 okay and these next three years might be the last few years that
I work okay. Remember this is Anthropics Chief of Staff and she says that the next three years might
be the last few years that I actually work which is number one an incredible statement but number
two it should show you the gravity of what we are truly dealing with here. It says I am not ill
nor am I becoming a stay at home mum nor have I been so financially fortunate to be on the brink
of voluntary retirement. I stand at the age of a technological development that seems likely
should it arrive to end employment as I know it. So this is not some kind of clickbait title where
I'm trying to draw you in. This is the exact word from this person who is working actively at
Anthropic. Now Anthropic is one of the leading AI labs that made Claude III which is of course Claude
Opus which is one of the frontier models that is performing very effectively. Now what we can see
here is something absolutely incredible. We can see them stating clearly that if it does arrive okay
you know whether we're standing at the edge of this which seems likely that it's going to end
employment. So you know a lot of the time okay individuals in certain communities they may discuss
labor and work as something that of course is you know going to be there for many individuals
like you and myself but the prevailing trend from many of the industry leaders that I continue to see
is the fact that there won't be any true work after a certain period of time due to the fact
that we have a situation on our hands where the technological developments that are coming
are most likely to end this paradigm hence the reason post-age-appearance so that you can navigate
this. Now basically she then states I work at a frontier AI company with every iteration of our
model I am confronted with something more capable and more general than before that's just absolutely
crazy with every iteration of our model I'm confronted with something more capable and more
general before. At this stage it can completely generate content on a wide range of topics it
can summarize and analyze texts possibly well and as someone who once made money at one point in time
as a freelance writer and prided myself on my ability to write large amounts of content quickly
a skill which like cutting blocks of ice from a frozen pond is arguably obsolete I find it hard
to not notice these advances okay remember that one I find it hard to not notice these advances
freelance writing was always an over subscribed skill set and the introduction of language models
has further intensified the competition now remember the whole point of these videos is to
ensure that you are paying attention because a lot of people just say ah you know we'll find
new jobs we'll be fine and I think that's very very ignorant because it's quite hard to ignore
the kind of developments that are going and eventually they will be you know impacting
nearly every industry on the planet so it says the general reaction okay and this is where you
know this is exactly what I say the general reaction to language models among knowledge
workers is one of denial okay one of denial okay and this is why I'm making these videos because
I want you all to understand that whilst yes in previous technological revolutions like when we
had the industrial revolution of the farming industry and many people were thinking oh no all
of these computers are going to take our jobs and all of us that work in the farm industry come the
problem is is that we're of course going to be having a situation where no longer are we going
to be needed in the farming industry so we might lose our place in society but of course in that
stage we did have a lot more things to do but the reason that this time is different okay and you
shouldn't be in denial okay especially among knowledge workers is that AI is the automation of
automation so it's a feedback loop because AI is something that can automate itself which is different
than previous generations remember that this time is different so it says they grasp at the ever
diminishing number of places where such models still struggle rather than noticing the ever growing
range of tasks where they still have reached or past human level this is something that I truly
truly think people need to understand it's about how you view the AI problem okay many people
literally just focus on the fact that LLMs you know hallucinate once or twice or in generative
AI images sometimes they make mistakes but you kind of look at things and you're like wait
overall okay like if we take the entire pie of AI into account overall there's like a small
subsection that with every iteration is growing and growing and growing and growing whereas like
most people like oh no it can't do this small bit oh it can still not do this small bit oh it can
still not do this small bit and eventually what's gonna happen is that it's all gonna be able to
be done by AI which means that like if you're at this stage right now where you can see that okay AI
is slowly starting to surpass human cognitive capabilities it's best at this point to be like
okay I'm gonna you know pay attention here and at least position myself rather than being
as she states in a place of denial so you know she says many will point out that AI systems are
not yet writing award-winning books let alone patenting inventions but and this is the most
important thing most of us also don't do these things okay and this is what I'm stating but a lot
of times people like oh AI can't write you know an entire novel from scratch and AI can't you know
paint this and it can't make this poster you know coherently with the text in five seconds like I
could but you couldn't do that most people couldn't do that AI is able to do a lot more than the average
person which is the point okay most people don't do these things and this is something that most
people are failing to acknowledge okay the economically and politically relevant comparison
on most tasks is not whether the language model is better than the best human it's whether they
are better than the human that would otherwise do the task and this is the most important distinction
I'm going to say it again the economically and politically relevant comparison on most tasks
is not whether the language model is better than the best human it's whether they are better than
the human that would otherwise do the tasks basically this question is the best question okay
because it shows you at what point things get automated and this is what I've spoken about
before imagine this for example right you have someone who works in a store okay let's say that
person previously they did you know check out at a grocery store okay right now we have AI
self-checkouts or whatever we've got all these kind of crazy things going on of course the
self-checkout is just a piece of technology but the point is guys is that is it sufficient to have
an AI system be better than the average person that would do the task in any scenario where that is
true you are going to get automation of that labor it doesn't need to be better than the best person
it just needs to be better than the average task that it would take and that is the important
distinction because a lot of people think oh this thing can't create Hollywood blockbuster movies
it's not going to you know affect the movie industry but it will affect other industries
like the film industry the photography industry all of these other ones especially when you know we
look at future models how much smarter they're going to be just because they're not going to be
as smart as Einstein it doesn't mean they're going to be smarter not smarter than the average researcher
which is of course very fascinating and then it says this makes the objection that AI systems are
not yet coding long sequences are doing more than fairly basic math on their own a more relevant one
but these systems will continue to improve at all cognitive tasks okay and that's an important
distinction because a lot of the cognitive labor you know it's kind of going away from the trends
that we can see okay the shared goal of the field of artificial intelligence is to create a system
that can do anything and she says here that I expect us to to soon reach it and if I'm right
how should we think about the coming adolescence of work so now here's where we talk about the
future of society so she says that it's not worth noting that upfront that even today work is far
from the only way to participate in society but nevertheless it has proven to be the best way to
transfer wealth and resources and provide personal goods like social connection status and meaning
and of course it offers social goods like political stability and here's where we get into the crazy
things given this should we meet the possibility of its loss with sadness fear and joy or hope
the overall economic effects of agi are difficult to forecast and here I will focus on the question
of how people will feel without work whether they will or can be happy and there are obviously
other vital questions like how will people be able to meet their material needs many have
examined this question and this is the important part here okay and this is why I launched a community
and why we're working on all these things many have examined this question okay with no final
answer yet as adopted by official policy for this contingency by any government so there is not a
single government that is currently looking at this problem and thinking okay this is going to be an
issue in a few years how are we going to tackle this and I think that that is important because
many people think that okay the government is going to be there to take care of me
but I would say that the government aren't really babysitters they just kind of look over you every
now and again to see if you're doing all right and if you're not about to die the government
doesn't really care about you that much of course depending on where you live this is something that
can be argued of course but I do think that this is for the majority of societies and the majority
of things it is very very true and of course you can see I will go ahead and assume that people can
meet their needs through universal basic income or other transfers and will solely concentrate on
the question or whether people can and will be happy or at least as happy as they are now
without work so here's where we talk about the obsolescence of knowledge work so you can see
I expect AI to get much better than it is today and research on AI systems has shown that they
predictably improve given better algorithms more and better quality data and of course more
computational power labs are in the process of further scaling up their clusters the groupings
of computers that the algorithms run on and machine learning is a young field with an enormous
amount of low hanging fruit in terms of discoveries I mean say fruit there and this means that you
know researchers can continuously find improvements on the algorithms of these AI systems so the point
here and I think this is one that you know it kind of goes back to what Leopold Aschenbrenner said
is that when we take a look okay at the fact that there is a lot of low hanging fruit this kind of
shifts our opinion it's not a field that is you know mature to the point where you know we are
you know at the edge of everything that we know or at least what we think we know
and it's very unlikely we're going to get a breakthrough for another 20 to 50 years
like in some fields this is a field that you know when we look at you know the fact that if
we know that we scale up another 10 times we're about to get a whole lot lot more we know that if
we improve the data quality and the amount of data we're about to get a whole lot more improvements
we also know that there's a lot of inefficient algorithms that we do use and we know that there
are literally a million different ways to improve these models in terms of the algorithmic efficiencies
in terms of how they respond so the point here is that there is a lot of low hanging fruit in this
industry and we're only at the frontier of what these models are going to be capable of since we
haven't like exhausted all those things if we had like exhausted the compute capabilities
or the algorithmic discoveries and we were like at the wit's end and these are the
kind of systems that we had then maybe potentially it could be argued that we were near the end in
terms of the growth especially in terms of the curve maybe the growth would you know start to
slow off like that so that is why i think this is really important because there was a lot of
low hanging fruit that could truly give us a lot more exponential gains and you can see while there
is an enormous amount of data that has already been fed through them there is still more to be
found and it could also be generated by the systems themselves so given the scaling laws
we can reasonably foresee that these systems will keep getting better at least until these inputs
run out so at what rate will they get better language models are not for the most part continuously
improving they get better in discontinuous jumps a rough analogy to the current lm process is that
making a new model is like baking a cake you figure out your data and algorithms like mixing the
batter then you pre-train the model that is to run it on a large number of computers for several
months like put it in the oven then you do some post training like frosting and decorating the cake
and of course this can adjust the model in certain different ways to make it more harmless honest or
to make it good at certain specific skills or use cases but what matters to most of us for the
model's capabilities at least right now of course is the underlying cake and this can't be easily
adjusted without starting over and baking something entirely new so when it comes to the rate of
progress when these models seem to plateau you should actually assume that that just just means
that the next model is in the oven but just hasn't come out yet and basically what they're stating is
that whilst yes you know some people do talk about how there is this iterative deployment at open AI
from what we can see growth in lm's is kind of like this we hear a staircase we hear a staircase
because essentially what you have is you have let's say for example you have gbt5 which brings us
to this level then we got gbt4 then we get gbt5 okay and the reason it's kind of like that is because
like they said you have this middle bit here where the model is being you know trained whatever or
you know mixed or whatever you call it whatever and then of course at the end you've got the
post training and of course here you've got the pre-training so this is essentially where you know
you're training the model for this entire period of time so what's interesting is that this period
of time where you train the model this entire period of time do apologize for the colors there
but training the model and then of course the model gets released after the post training
and then that's when we get those new jumps which is why it's very hard to say that right now you
know things are plateauing because these models do take several months in most cases to train
especially because the clusters can't support that much you know work going on at the moment so
here we can see many expect AI to eventually be able to do every economically useful task which is
truly insane statement so many expect AI to do every economically useful task which is absolutely
crazy and remember she agrees now this is Anthropics Chief of Staff here and it says
given the current trajectory of technology I expect AI to first excel at any kind of online
work essentially anything that a remote worker can do AI will do better copywriting tax preparation
customer services and many other tasks are or will soon be heavily automated I can see the
beginnings in areas like software development and contract law generally tasks that involved
reading analyzing and synthesizing information and then generating content based on it it seems
ripe for replacement by language models so basically right here this gives you a first
insight into some of the careers that are under not scrutiny but under the microscope in terms of
where things are going to be truly automated you might want to note this down I will have of
course all the notes on in my school community so that you guys can easily read this and digest
the information and an easy to use matter but guys this is some key key statements that people
are not paying attention to because the main thing here is that anything on a computer anything
remote anything online those things you have to think now about okay if I'm a remote worker
if I'm someone that's enjoying my life traveling around the world well that's what I want to do
I need to think about these industries here and how I can position myself okay to not be automated
away or to not at least be less economically valuable than an AI system sure you might be
10% better than an AI system but you have to remember that it's much easier for a company
to replace your high salary with an AI system that costs much less and I do think in the future
what we will see is AI systems that are truly truly effective and of course that can run for 24
hours remember you're just a human you can't run for 24 hours like these AI systems can and with all
the AI agents being built on the back end trust me guys things are truly ripe for disruption
so you need to think okay how could I do this okay and how could I manage myself better in order to
at least not be in that place where I'm less economically valuable than this thing and here's
where we have some more stuff so here's where we get to the obsolescence part and this is where we
actually start to look at certain industries and how things are going to be changing so essentially
what she talks about here is that you know this is not going to come for every industry at the
same pace it's not like one day everyone's working and the next day everyone's not we're
going to have a situation on our hands where this area is now affected this area is now affected
this area is now affected and it's going to definitely be proportional to AI system releases
for example when GPT-5 does release I do expect a wider range of jobs to be not completely automated
but very nearly on that chopping block level to where you know there's going to be another wave
of potentially layoffs or potentially you know companies that used to hire people not hiring
people and the problem is is that these effects are downstream meaning that if someone was going to
create a company in the future and they choose not to create a company you don't experience that
level until like maybe 12 to 48 months after because the companies that would have replaced
the old ones that wouldn't hire you those ones no longer exist so overall that entire market
share has died down so essentially the pace of improvements in robotics lags significantly
behind cognitive automation it's improving as well but more slowly so this is basically what
they're saying is that if you do anything with your hands that is pretty intricate and a guided
specific situation for example you know surgeons gardeners plumbers jewelry makers hairstylists
as well as those who repair ironwork or who make a stained glass might find their handiwork
contributing to our society for many more years to come and this is of course uh you know very
very true I do think that you know people in these industries they have a unique set of skills that
you know for a robot to do as well as a plumber it's very very hard considering you know the fact
that it needs to navigate its way into a house deal with the customer be able to identify what's
going wrong stop the water flowing whatever issue it may be then coordinate with all of these kind
of things like if you try to get a team of you know engineers to get a robot to do that that would
cost a lot and it would be so expensive to do that but you know an AI system that's on a computer
running that can take control of a computer that is something that is vastly easier which is why
a lot of the people who work at desks are more at risk than someone who does a manual labor job
and this is something that I think this trend is important to pay attention to so
of course regulated industries like medicine or the civil service will have human involvement
for longer but even there expecting increasingly number of human workers who are you know supplemented
with AI systems working alongside them so basically with this one is that if you work in a regulated
industry or you're thinking about getting into one I think those ones are still pretty good for
the future because regulatory boards and stuff like that they do take a lot of time to allow people
to get into their industries you know for example like to become a doctor there's all these tests
you have to take to become a lawyer you got to pass the bar you got to do this it's this whole
kind of thing whether you want to call it status even if the even if the AI system is better there's
just this human kind of aspect where even if AI systems are better because of the regulatory bodies
and how AI might be viewed at that time AI is probably not going to be penetrating those industries
very very soon like it's not going to be okay AI's here boom let's use it they're still regulatory
bodies that people you know follow and it's going to be really hard to change those because small
changes and small issues with AI systems unless they're like a hundred percent and unless they have
no bias no this no that no that it's going to be really hard to change those legacy industries
because they are very very resistant to change and they were built upon those you know strict
foundations so you know careers that have like you know all those regulations around them I
think those are going to be secure for a very very long time now of course we talk about industries
that are going to be preferred for humans so for example you know those jobs that you know where
you want a human to do it even if an AI system might be better so for example jobs that might
fall into this category include counselors, doolers, caretakers for the elderly, babysitters,
preschool teachers, priests and religious leaders even sex workers much has been made of AI girlfriends
but I still expect that a large percentage of buyers of in-person sexual services will have a
strong preference for humans and I think this is an interesting term here nostalgic jobs and I
think that term actually does make sense so you can see that these jobs right here even if you have
like an AI system that is you know just amazing you know sitting a baby but let's say it's great
as a babysitter I would not want an AI system babysitting my child I would want it to have the
human to human connection I would want it to understand what other humans want this is just
going to be something that maybe as I grow older and as I you know get older into my older years
I'm just like that old person who's a who's scared of robotic technology and I'm like no
I want a human looking after my kid or whatever or maybe you know even people growing up now
they still find it weird but over time those values can shift as robots become more and more
useful and as they become more and more human like so it's going to be interesting to see
how things are going to be you know done in the aspect but these jobs right here they're essentially
valued because there is a human right there so if I was going through a problem I wouldn't really
want to talk to an AI system because the whole thing about like counseling and stuff like that
and being you know talking to a therapist is that there's a human who actually empathizes with you
and no matter how smart an AI system might be it hasn't had its own you know subjective or objective
whatever you want to say experience of the real world so it's not going to be able to empathize
with you on that way that an actual person that can be like oh you know I understand that I went
through that you know I've had this experience I had that happen to me when I was 21 um and that
like the things like that are just completely priceless so those things there like those areas
and categories are going to really are going to really do well which is why it's important to like
kind of look at this because you know a lot of people don't understand truly the dynamic on how
things are going to change given the nature of AI going now for the rest of this article there are
some you know interesting things there is the psychology of employment which is you know as
automation rolls out across these industries how are people going to feel and basically what they're
stating here is that you know evidence shows unsurprisingly okay in fact no this is actually
quite surprising is that you know basically they're trying to look at how unemployment actually
affects people okay and it says that one study they're trying to tackle this looked at the effects
of unemployment caused by the collapse of the Spanish construction industry on mental and physical
health and this particularly study was attempting to disentangle the causality because people who
lose their job during a nationwide collapse of an industry will avoid the selection effect
these individuals are no more likely to have mental mental or physical issues than other members of
the population and it says by looking at large-scale survey responses before and after the crisis
they found that unemployment did appear to increase the likelihood of reporting poorer health and it
says here it does seem that overall unemployment makes people sadder, sicker and more anxious but
it isn't clear if this is an inherent facts of unemployment or a contingent one okay because
basically the problem is this right if you right now you're unemployed okay why are you sadder think
about that for a second okay why are you sadder because number one you might have less status
because you don't have a job and number two you know you don't have any money okay you don't have
any money coming in so you might think okay i'm not bringing any value into society and i'm not
making a living for myself and of course i might be homeless and yada yada yada and you can see right
here you've got all these things that they talk about okay you know the financial effects are
probably the main one like if i gave you right now 10 million dollars and i said you can never
work again in your life you know you're never allowed to have a job even if you wanted one you
just are not allowed to work most people would laugh run off with the 10 million and be like this
guy doesn't know what he's talking about and that's the main point here is that it's hard to
understand whether or not humans derive meaning from employment or it's just the contingent effects
okay and you can see right here is that of course this might not occur in the context of universal
basic income and of course it's compounded with the shame aspect of being fired or laid off when
you know you really feel like you should be working as opposed to the context where essentially
all workers have been displaced intuitively it seems that there should be more negative
psychological effects from losing a job in a way that feels like a personal failing or that sets one
apart from one's peers versus losing a job in a blameless way or at the same time in the same manner
as one's peers basically what they're stating here is as well is that whilst you might think that a
lot of people who lose their jobs during this revolution might be sad if everyone loses it at
the same time like people did in the pandemic people actually don't increase their psychological
distress because everyone's in the same boat you can see here they found that individuals who were
temporary laid off in april of 2020 reported lowest levels of distress compared to their peers
remained employed and you can see here the widespread nature of layoff normalized the
experience reducing the personal blame and fostering a sense of shared experience and of
course financial strain was mitigated by government support personal savings and reduced spendings
which buffed against potential distress so basically they're stating that there might not
be as much angst and as anxiety in the future if everyone is in the same boat but i do think
that this is going to be nuanced because there are going to be a lot of industries that are
affected before other ones as we previously discussed knowledge work cognitive labor jobs
jobs on our computer those ones are going to be automated heavily away first and it's not going to
be all at once some companies are going to choose to implement them some companies are going to say
nope we're a hundred percent human run we're never going to use AI that's going to be their
marketing gimmick those are the companies that you kind of want to you know work for and be
you know you know aligning your options with but it's going to be kind of interesting as well like
you know if you're looking to work for a company you know try and see what their CEOs view are on AI
of course every CEO's incentive is to make more money so they're probably going to do that but
you'd be surprised at how things work in the future and this is where we get into two of the most
interesting concepts here okay and this is where she talks about in banks the culture books and
this is where you know they are completely post scarcity society money is viewed as crude and
irrelevant for allocating resources living space raw materials and energy are produced in abundance
for its citizens and the capacity of its means of production are ubiquitously and comprehensively
exceeded every reasonable demands it's not unimaginative citizens could make yet culture
at least has one need that this abundance cannot satisfy that feeling was the urge to not feel
useless basically to cut the nonsense this passage highlights the fundamental and AI need to feel
like they are contributing to something larger than themselves even in a paradise where all
material needs are met the psychological need still persists and she states here that you know
you can think about it right now do you do anything that you are notably worse at than other people
just for the sheer value of doing it she talks about how you know being a ballerina even though
she's in her mid 20s and you know being a ballerina is long behind her but moving her body like that
still brings her joy and this is where she talks about post-agi so she says a renowned AI researcher
once told me that he is practicing for post-agi by taking up activities that he's not particularly
good at jujitsu surfing and so on and savoring the doing even without excellence this is how we
can prepare for our future where we will have to do things from joy rather than a need where we will
no longer be the best at them but we will still have to choose how we fill our days we will also
not need to choose how to fill our time alone in the context where we are all out of work
and where this is one of our main worries it means we built relatively aligned artificial
general intelligence for the same reasons i expect us to reach agi i expect it to progress
beyond this point to where we have superhuman systems for the same reason these systems will
be helpful with anything we should expect that these systems will be able to help with the problems
that they create and basically what they're stating here is that if we get superhuman systems that
replace us there's no reason to think that they cannot help us if we don't have meaning in this
future world and i think this article is very important like i said i'm gonna have like a you
know a short private blog where i summarize everything into a nice area on my school and this
video you know is likely going to be released on the school community going to be released on the
school community a few days earlier because this is the community where we discuss how we can actually
navigate this stuff and i don't want you guys to feel like look there's nothing i can do there
is so much that you can do in order to be proactive especially in the last few years of work there
are investments that you can make there are ways that you can transition your career from one area
to another there are mindsets that you can use there are frameworks that you can apply to your
life to ensure you're not one of the people that get first automated because whilst automation
is something that is coming it might not get you first if you're able to move out of the way
and you're still able to be relatively valuable in the economy that's what the entire thing is about
so let me know what you think about this entire document it is definitely a long one maybe i did
go over my time limit here but i think this is probably one of the most important articles
because i think by at least 2027 we're truly going to see the trajectory of where things are going
because at that stage we will likely have had at least four to five years by 2030 of AI development
we will likely have the biggest clusters being built we will likely have maxed out the you know
physical hardware so we're likely going to see where those developments are going to be in the
sense that any more improvements are going to be hard to come by and therefore we know that the
jobs that currently exist for humans are probably going to be there for quite some time so this was
something that most people just did miss but i'm pretty sure that this article was something that i
think is definitely valuable to those of you who are concerned about the future of post-age
economics let me know some of your thoughts on how all of this is going to go down and what your
plans are and if you enjoyed this video i'll see you in the next
