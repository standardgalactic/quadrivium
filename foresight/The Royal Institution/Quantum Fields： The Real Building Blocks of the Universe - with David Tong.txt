tonight I'd like to tell you about one of the big questions in science it's a
question that goes back at least two and a half thousand years to the ancient
Greeks and it's a question that has been discussed in this room many many times
over the past 200 years but it's an important question and I think it's
important that we revisit it and the question is simply this it's what are
we made of what are the fundamental building blocks of nature that you and
me and everything else in the universe constructed that's the story I'd like
to tell you so what I'd like to do is try and give you an overview of our
current understanding I'd also like to try and give you an overview of where we
hope to go in the future of what progress we can we can hope to make in the
next few years and few decades and we're gonna cover quite a lot of ground in
in this talk I should warn you now not least because I'm gonna discuss every
single thing in the universe quite literally we're going to talk amongst
other things about what's happening at the world's most powerful particle
collider this is a machine that's called the Large Hadron Collider or the LHC for
short it'll come up a lot in this talk and it's a machine which is based
underground in a place called CERN which is just outside Geneva we'll also talk
about experiments in the last few years that look backwards in time towards the
Big Bang that give us some understanding about what was happening in the first
few fractions of a second after time itself started to exist and on top of
all this I also want to give you some idea about the theoretical abstract
ideas and even a little bit idea about the mathematics that underlies our
current understanding of the universe because I'm a theoretical physicist what
I do is study the equations try to understand the equations that govern
the world we live in and so I just like to give you a flavor of what that's
about at some point I should warn you now at some point I'm even going to show
you an equation okay you know that you can get sent on training courses for
this kind of this kind of thing there's a number one rule the number one rule is
never show the many equations if you show them equations you'll just terrify
them at some point in this lecture you're all going to be terrified so just
prepare yourselves okay okay you know there's a traditional way to start talks
like this the traditional way is to be very cultured and talk about what
democracies and Lucretias said two and a half thousand years ago and the ideas
that the ancient Greeks had about about atoms but you know I don't want to start
like this we've made a lot of progress in two and a half thousand years and you
know there's just better places to kick off a science talk so the first modern
picture that we had of what the universe is made of everything we're made of is
this so I hope this is familiar to most people here this is the periodic table of
elements okay it's one of the most iconic images in in all of science what we
have here are 120 ish different elements I should point out no less than 10 of
which were discovered in this very building and which constitute or at least
in the 1800s were thought to constitute everything that existed in in nature so
it's certainly true that any material you get you can distill it down into its
component parts and you'll find that all of those component parts are made of
one of these 120 elements so it's it's a great moment in science it's really one
of the triumphs of science it's also I should add the reason that I stopped
doing chemistry in school because if you're a chemist this is basically as
good as it gets and you know if we're honest it's kind of a mess right I you
know everything in the universe is classified into things on the left that
go bang if you put them in water through to things on the right which really if
we're honest don't do very much at all you kind of organize everything into this
stupid shape so there's a little bit like Australia there's a big dip in the
top and then and then there's these two strips of elements that you have to put
along the bottom because there's no room for them in the middle where they
belong you know it I don't know about you if I was asked to come up with a
fundamental classification of everything in the universe this isn't what I would
have gone for are there any chemists in the audience I'm sorry for you okay but
you know I'm not alone in this it's not just me that thinks this is a silly way
to organize nature nature itself thinks this is a silly way to to organize
nature of course we know this isn't the fundamental this isn't the end of the
story this isn't the fundamental building blocks and the first person to
realize there's that there's something deeper than this was a Cambridge
physicist called JJ Thompson so at the end of the 1800s JJ Thompson discovered
a particle that was smaller than an atom that we now call the electron and in
1897 he announced this in this room in fact in in this very lecture series to a
stunned audience an audience that was so stunned at least half of them didn't
believe what he was saying there was one very distinguished scientist who
afterwards told JJ Thompson he thought the whole thing was a hoax that JJ
Thompson had just been pulling their leg but of course it's not a hoax this
isn't the fundamental elements of nature and within 15 years of JJ Thompson's
discovery his successor in Cambridge a man called Ernest Rutherford had figured
out exactly what these atoms are made of and this is the picture that that
Rutherford came up with so we now know that each of these elements consists of
a nucleus which is tiny the metaphor that Rutherford himself used was it's
like a fly in the center of the cathedral and then orbiting this nucleus in I
should add fairly blurry orbits are the electrons which sort of fill out very
sparsely the rest of the space so that's our picture of these atoms
subsequently we learned that the nucleus is not itself fundamental the nucleus
contains smaller particles they're particles that we call protons and
neutrons and in the 1970s we learned that the protons and neutrons aren't
fundamental either so in the 1970s we learned that inside each proton and
neutron are three smaller particles that we call quarks there are two
different kinds of quarks by the 1970s I'm guessing physicists didn't have a
classical Greek education and they'd kind of run out of you know classy names
so we call these quarks the up quark and the down quark okay for no good reason
it's not like the up quark is higher than the down quark it's not like it
points up and just no good reason at all the up quark and the down quark so the
proton consists of two up quarks and a down quark and the neutron consists of
two down quarks and an up quark okay this as far as we know are the fundamental
building blocks of nature we've never discovered anything smaller than the
electron and we've never discovered anything smaller than the quarks so we
have three particles of which everything we know is made and it's it's worth
stressing it that's kind of astonishing you know it's we sort of take it for
granted we learn this in school we don't really think about it deeply
everything we see in the world all the diversity in the natural world you me
everything around us we just the same three particles with slightly
different rearrangements repeated over and over and over again it's it's an
amazing lesson to to draw about how how the world is is put together so that
that's what we have we have an electron and two quarks and you know these aren't
the fundamental building blocks that the Greeks had thought about and there's
certainly not the fundamental building blocks that the Victorians had thought
about but you know the spirit of the issue really hasn't changed the spirit
is exactly what democracy said two hundred two thousand five hundred years
ago it's that there are like Lego bricks from which everything in the world is
constructed these Lego bricks are particles and the particles are the
electron and two quarks it's a very nice picture it's a very comforting picture
it's the picture we teach kids at school it's the picture we even teach our
students in undergraduate university and there's a problem with it the
problem is it's a lie it's it's a white lie it's a white lie that we tell our
children because you know we don't want to expose them to the the difficult and
horrible truth too early on it makes it easier to learn if you believe that that
these particles are the fundamental building blocks of the universe but it's
simply not true the best theories that we have of physics do not have underlying
them the quark particle in the two quark particles and the sorry the electron
particle and the two quark particles in fact the very best theories we have of
physics don't rely on particles at all the best theories we have tell us that
the fundamental building blocks of nature are not particles but something much
more nebulous and abstract the fundamental building blocks of nature are
fluid like substances which are spread throughout the entire universe and
ripple in strange and interesting ways okay that's the fundamental reality in
which we live these fluid like substances we have a name for we call
them fields so this is a picture of you that this isn't the kind of field that
physicists have in mind you know that this is this is what you think a field
is if you're a farmer or if you're a normal person if if you're a physicist
you have a very different picture in your mind when you think about fields and
I'll tell you the the general definition of a field and then we'll go
through some examples so that you get get get familiar with this the the
physicist definition of a field is the following it's something that as I said
is spread everywhere throughout the universe it's something that takes a
particular value at every point in space and what's more that value can change
in time okay so the picture to having your mind as a field sorry the fluid
which ripples and sways throughout the universe now it's not a new idea it's
it's not an idea that we've we've just come up with it's an idea which dates
back almost 200 years and like so many other things in science it's an idea
which originated in this very room because as I'm sure many of you are
aware this is the home of Michael Faraday and Michael Faraday initiated this
lecture series in 1825 he gave over a hundred of these Friday evening
discourses and the vast majority of these were on his own discoveries on the
experiments he did on electricity and magnetism so he he did many many things
in electricity and magnetism over many decades and in doing so he built up an
intuition for how an electric and magnetic phenomena work and the
intuition is what we now call the electric and magnetic field so what he
envisaged was that threaded everywhere throughout space with these invisible
objects called the electric and magnetic fields now you know we learn this in
school again it's something that we sort of take for granted because we learned
at an early age and we don't sort of appreciate just how big of a radical
step this this idea of Faraday's is I want to stress it's one of the most
revolutionary abstract ideas in the history of science that these electric
and magnetic fields exist so you know let me just you're supposed to do
demonstrations in this and I you know I'm I'm I'm not just a theoretical physicist
I'm a very theoretical physicist it's very hard for me to do any kind of
experiment that's going to work but I'm just going to show you something that
that you know you've all seen they're magnets okay and we all played these
games when we were kids or when we were in school you take these magnets and you
move them together and as they get closer and closer there's this force that
you can sort of just just feel building up that pushes the pressure that pushes
against these two magnets and you know it doesn't matter how often you do it it
doesn't matter how many degrees you have in physics it's it's just a little bit
magical you know are you and you all you all know this there's something just
just special about this this weird feeling that that you get between
between magnets and this was Faraday's genius it was to appreciate that that
even though you can't see anything in between even though no matter how closely
you look the space between these magnets will seem to be empty he said
nonetheless there's something real there there's something real and physical
which is invisible but is building up and that's what's responsible for the
force so he called them lines of force we now call it the magnetic field so on
the so this of course is it's a picture of Michael Faraday this is a picture of
Michael Faraday lecturing behind this very table here is a drawing from one of
Michael Faraday's papers it was pointed out to me earlier when you leave
there's a carpet just here the carpet has this pattern this picture just
repeated on it over and over and over again and on the bottom here is one of
Michael Faraday's most famous demonstrations that he did here so I'll
just walk you through what what Faraday did the thing on the thing on the
right there's a small coil with a hand on it this is a battery and the battery
passes a current around this coil and in doing so there's a magnetic field that's
induced in this it's what's called a solenoid and then Faraday did the
following thing he simply moved this small coil a through this big coil B
like this and something miraculous happened when you do that there's a
moving magnetic field Faraday's great discovery was induction it gives rise to
a current in B which then over on this end of the table makes a needle flicker
like this so extremely simple you move a magnetic field and it gives rise to a
current which makes a needle flip flicker on the other side of the table
this astounded audience is in the 1800s okay because you were doing something and
affecting the needle on the other end of the table yet you never touched the
needle you know it was amazing you could you could you could make something
move without ever going near it without ever touching it you know we kind of
jaded these days you can do the same experiment you can pick out your cell
phone you can press a few buttons you can call somebody on the other end of the
earth within within seconds but it's the same principle but this was the first
time it was demonstrated that the field is real you can communicate using the
field you can affect things far away using the field without ever ever
touching it so this is Michael Faraday's legacy it's that there's not just
particles in the world there's other objects that are slightly more subtle
that are called fields that are spread throughout all of space but by the way
if you ever want to really appreciate the genius of Michael Faraday he gave
this lecture in 1846 give many lectures in 1846 but there was one in
particular where he finished 20 minutes early he ran out of things to say so he
engaged in some idle speculation for 20 minutes and Faraday suggested that
these invisible electric and magnetic fields that he'd postulated were quite
literally the only thing we've ever seen he suggested that it's ripples of the
electric and magnetic field which is what we call light so it took of course
50 years for people like Maxwell and Hertz to confirm that this is indeed what
light is made of but it was Faraday's genius that appreciated this that
there are waves in the electric magnetic field and those waves of the light that
we see around us okay so this is Faraday's legacy but it turns out this
idea of fields was much more important than Faraday had realized and it took
over 150 years for us to appreciate the importance of this field of these fields
so what happened in these 150 years was that there was a small revolution in
science in the 1920s we realized that the world is very very different from the
common sense ideas that Newton and Galileo had handed down to us centuries
before so in the 1920s people like Heisenberg and Schrodinger realized that
on the smallest scales on the microscopic scales the world is much more
mysterious and counter-intuitive than we ever really imagined it could be this of
course is the theory that we now know as quantum mechanics so there's a lot I
could I could say about quantum mechanics let me let me tell you one of the
punchlines of quantum mechanics one of the punchlines is that energy isn't
continuous energy in the world is always parceled up into some little
discrete lump that's actually what the word quantum means quantum means
discrete or lumpy so the real fun starts when you try and take the ideas of
quantum mechanics which say that things should be discrete and you try to
combine them with Faraday's ideas of fields which are very much continuous
smooth objects which are waving and oscillating in in space so the idea of
trying to combine these two theories together is what we call quantum field
theory and here's the implication of quantum field theory the first
implication is what happens for the electric and magnetic field so Faraday
taught us and Maxwell later that waves of the electromagnetic field are what we
call light but when you apply quantum mechanics to this you find that these
light waves aren't quite as smooth and continuous as they appeared so if you
look closely at light waves you'll find that they're made of particles they're
little particles of light and these are particles that we call the photon okay
the magic of this idea is that that same principle applies to every single
other particle in the universe so there is spread everywhere throughout this
room something that we call the electron field it's like a fluid that fills
this room and in fact fills the entire universe and the ripples of this
electron fluid the ripples of the waves of this fluid get tied into little
bundles of energy by the rules of quantum mechanics and those bundles of
energy are what we call the particle the electron all the electrons that are in
your body are not fundamental all the electrons that exist in your body are
waves of the same underlying field okay we're all connected to each other it's
like you know the waves on the ocean all belong to the the same underlying
ocean the electrons in your body are the ripples of the same field as the
electrons in my body okay there's more than this there's also in this room two
quark fields and the ripples of these two quark fields give rise to what we
call the up quark and the down quark and the same is true for every other kind of
particle in the universe there are fields that underlie everything and what we
think of as particles aren't really particles at all they're waves of these
fields tied up into little bundles of energy okay so this is the legacy of
Faraday this is where Faraday's vision of a field has taken us there are no
particles in the world the basic fundamental building blocks of our
universe are these fluid like substances that we call fields
all right okay so what I want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you where
that vision takes us I want to tell you about you know what it means that we're
not made of particles we're made of fields and I want to tell you what we
can do with that and how we can best understand the universe around us okay
so here's the first thing um take a box and take every single thing that
exists out of that box take all the particles out the box all the atoms
out the box what you're left with is a pure vacuum and this is what the vacuum
looks like so what you're looking at here is a computer simulation using our
best theory of physics it's something called the standard model which I'll
introduce later but it's a computer simulation of absolutely nothing this
is empty space literally empty space with with nothing in it this is the
simplest thing you could possibly imagine in the universe and you can see
it so you know it's an interesting place to be empty space you know it's not
it's not dull and boring what you're looking at here is that even when the
particles are taken out the field still exists the field is there but what's
more the field is governed by the rules of quantum mechanics and there's a
principle in quantum mechanics which is called the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle which says you're not allowed to sit still and the field has to obey
this so even when there's nothing else there the field is constantly bubbling
and fluctuating in what's quite honestly a very complicated way okay these
are things that we call quantum vacuum fluctuations but this is what nothing
this looks like from the perspective of our current theories of physics okay
it's worth saying that this is a computer simulation it looks a little bit
like a cartoon but it's actually quite a powerful computer simulation that took a
long time to do but these aren't just theoretical these quantum fluctuations
that are there in the pure vacuum are things that we can measure there's
something called the Casimir force the Casimir force is a force between two
metal plates that get pushed together basically because there's more of this
stuff on the outside than on the inside and you know these are real these are
things that we can measure and they behave just as we would predict they
would from from our theories so this is nothing and this brings me to the more
mathematical side of of the talk because there's a challenge in this that this is
the simplest thing we can imagine in the entire universe and it's complicated
okay it's astonishingly complicated and it doesn't get easier than this you know
if you want to now understand not nothing but a single particle well that's
much more complicated than this and if you want to understand 10 to the 23
particles all doing something interesting that's really really much more
complicated than this so there's a problem in my problem not yours in
addressing you know this fundamental description of the universe which is
that it's just hard okay the mathematics that we use to describe quantum fields to
describe everything that we're made of in terms of quantum fields is
substantially more difficult than the maths that arises in any other area of
physics or science okay it's it's genuinely difficult I can put this in
some perspective there's a list of six open problems in mathematics they're
considered to be the six hardest problems in mathematics they used to be
seven but some crazy Russian guy solved one of them so that there's six left you
in a million bucks if you can solve any one of these problems if you know a
little bit of mathematics they're things like the Riemann hypothesis or P versus
NP and they're sort of famously difficult problems this is one of those six
problems you win a million dollars if you can understand this okay so what
does it mean it doesn't mean can you build a big computer and just demonstrate
that these are there it means can you understand from first principles by
solving the equations the patterns that emerge within these quantum fluctuations
okay it's an extraordinarily difficult problem you know it's right in the
kind of thing I do I don't know a single person in the world who's actually
working on this problem you know that that's how hard it is we don't really
even know how to begin to start understanding these kind of ideas in
in quantum field okay that this theme about the mathematics being being
challenging is something which which is going to come back later in the talk so
I'd like just to take a little bit of a diversion for a few minutes and give you
a sense about what we can do mathematically and what we can't do
mathematically just sort of tell you what the state of play is in terms of
us understanding these theories called quantum field theories which which
underlie our universe so there there are times where we understand extremely well
what's going on with quantum fields and that happens basically when these
fluctuations are very calm and tame when they're not wild and strong these
ones are big but when they're they're much more calmer when the vacuum is much
more like a mill pond than it is like a raging storm in those cases we really
think we understand what what we're doing and to illustrate this I just want
to give you this this example so this number G is a particular property of
the electron particle and I'll quickly explain what it is the electron is a
particle and it turns out the electron spins it orbits rather like the earth
orbits and it has an axis of spin and you can change the axis of that spin and
the way you change it is you take a magnetic field like this and in the
presence of a magnetic field the electron will spin the electron will stay in
one place but spin and then the axis of spin will slowly rotate like this it's
what's called procession and the speed at which the axis of that spin
processes is dictated by this number here okay so it's not the most important
thing in you know the big picture however historically this has been
extremely important in the history of physics because it turns out this is a
number you can measure very very accurately doing experiments and so
this number has sort of acted as a testing ground for us to see how well we
understand the theories that underlie nature and in particular quantum field
theory so let me tell you what you're looking at here the first number is the
result of many many decades of painstaking experiments measuring very
very precisely this feature of the electron it's called the magnetic
moment and the second number is the result of many many decades of very
torturous calculations sitting down with a pen and paper and trying to predict
from first principles from quantum field theory what the magnetic moment of the
electron should be and you can see it's it's simply spectacular and that
there's nothing like this anywhere else in science with an agreement between the
theoretical calculation and the experimental measurements it's sort of I
think it's it's 12 or 13 significant figures it's it's it's really
astonishing any other area of science you'll be jumping up and down for joy
if you get the first two numbers right economics not even that but this is
where we're at in particle physics on a good day when we really understand what
we're doing with it's substantially better than than than any other area of
science 12 significant figures but this of course I've shown it because this is
our best result there are many other results that are nowhere near as good
and the difficulty comes when those quantum vacuum fluctuations start getting
wilder and stronger so let me give you an example it should be possible for us
to sit down and calculate from first principles the mass of the proton okay
we have the equations you know everything should be there we just
need to work hard and and figure out what the mass of the proton is just by
doing calculations we've been trying to do this for about 40 years now we can
get it to within an accuracy of something like 3% which which isn't bad you
know we're 3% there but but we should be much much better you know we should be
sort of pushing these levels of of accuracy and the reason is very simple
we know we've got the right equation we're pretty sure we you know we're
solving the right equation it's simply that we're not smart enough to solve it
okay 40 years the world's most powerful computers lots and lots of smart people
but but just you know we haven't managed to figure this out yet okay that there
are other situations that I won't tell you about where we don't even get off
the ground there are some situations where for very fairly subtle reasons
we're unable to use computers to help us and we simply have no idea what we're
doing so it's a slightly strange situation we have this theories of physics
that the best theories we've ever developed as you can see by this but at
the same time they're also the theories that we understand the least and it's to
make progress we sort of have this strange balancing act between you know
increasing our theoretical understanding and figuring out how to apply that to the
experiments that that we're doing and again it's a theme I'll come back to at
the end of the end of this lecture all right so so far I've been talking in a
little bit of generality about you know what we're made of and this this is the
punchline for the halfway point of the talk you're all made of quantum fields
and I don't understand at least I don't understand them as well as I I think I
should so what I want to do now is is go into a little bit more specifics I
want to tell you exactly what quantum fields you're all made of in fact I'll
tell you exactly what quantum fields exist in the universe and the good news
is that not many of them so I'll simply tell you all of them so we started with
periodic table this is the new periodic table and it's much simpler you know it's
much nice there are the three particles that we're all made of there's the
electron and the two quarks the up quark and the down quark and as I've stressed
the particles aren't fundamental what's really fundamental is the field that
underlies them and then it turns out there's a fourth particle that I've not
discussed so far it's called the neutrino it's not important in what we're
made of but it does play another important role in elsewhere in the
universe these neutrinos are everywhere you've never noticed them but since I
began this talk something like 10 to the 14 of them have streamed through the
body of each and every one of you as many coming from above from outer space
as actually coming from below because they stream all the way through the
earth and then and then keep going they're not very sociable they don't
interact so this is every what everything is made of these are the four
particles that form the the bedrock of our universe except then something
rather strange happened for a reason that we do not understand at all nature
has chosen to take these four particles and reproduce them twice over so this
is actually the list of all the fields that make up particles in our universe
so what are we looking at here this is the electron it turns out there are two
other particles which behave in every way exactly the same as the electron
except they're heavier we call them the muon which has a mass of something like
200 times the electron and the tail particle which is 3,000 times heavier
than the electron okay why are they there we have no idea at all it's one of the
mysteries of the universe there's also two more neutrinos so there are three
neutrinos in total and the two quarks that we first knew about and now joined
by four others that we call the strange quark and the charmed quark and then by
the time we got here we really ran out of any kind of inspiration for naming
and we called them the bottom quark and and the top quark okay so I should I
should stress we understand things very very well going this way we understand
why they come in a group of four we understand why they have the properties
that that they do we don't understand it at all going this way we don't know why
there's three of these rather than two of them or seventeen of them or that
that's that's a mystery but this is everything this is everything in the
universe everything you're made of is is these three at the top there and it's
only when you go to more exotic situations like particle colliders that
we need the others on the bottom but every single thing we've ever seen can
be made out of these 12 particles 12 fields these 12 fields interact with
each other and they interact through four different forces two of these are
extremely familiar the force of gravity and the force of electromagnetism but
there's also two other forces which operate only on small scales of a
nucleus so there's something called the strong nuclear force which holds the
quarks together inside protons and neutrons and there's something called the
weak nuclear force which is responsible for radioactive decay and among other
things for making the sunshine again each of these forces is associated to a
field so Faraday taught us about the electromagnetic field but there's a
field associated to this which is called the glue on field and a field
associated to this which is called the W and Z bows on field there's also a
field associated to gravity and this was really Einstein's great insights
into the world the field associated to gravity turns out to be space and time
itself so if you've never heard that before that was the world's shortest
introduction to general relativity and I'm not gonna say anything else about it
I'll just let you figure that one out for yourself okay so this is this is the
universe we live in there are 12 fields that give matter I'll call the matter
fields and four other fields that are the forces and the world we live in is
these combination of the 16 fields all interacting together in in interesting
ways so this is what you should think of the universe as like it's filled with
these fields fluid like substances 12 matter four forces one of the matter
fields starts to oscillate and ripple say the electron field starts to wave up
and down because there's electrons there that will kick off one of the other
fields it'll kick off say the electromagnetic field which in turn
will also oscillate and ripple there'll be light which is emitted so that'll
oscillate dribble at some point it'll start interacting with the quark field
which in turn will oscillate and ripple and the picture we end up with is this
harmonious dance between all these fields interlocking each other swaying
moving this way and that way that's the picture that we have of the fundamental
laws of physics we have a theory which underlies all this it is to put it
simply the pinnacle of science it's the greatest theory we've ever come up with
we've given it the most astonishingly rubbish name you've ever heard of we
call it the standard model okay when you hear the name the standard model it
sounds tedious and Monday it should really be replaced for the greatest
theory in the history of human civilization okay that's that's what
we're looking at okay so this is everything except it's not quite I've
actually just missed out one field there's one extra thing we know about
which became quite famous in in recent years it was a field that was first
suggested in the 1960s by a Scottish physicist called Peter Higgs and it was
by the 1970s it had become an integral part of the way we thought about the
universe but for the longest time we didn't have direct experimental evidence
that this existed where direct experimental evidence means we make
this Higgs field ripple so we see a particle that's associated to it and
this changed this changed famously four years ago at the LHC these are the two
experiments at the LHC that discovered it that they're sort of the size of
cathedrals and just packed full of electronics they're astonishing things
this is called atlas this is called CMS the Higgs particle doesn't last for
long the Higgs particle lasts about 10 to the minus 22 seconds so it's not like
you know you see it and you get to take a picture of it and put it on Instagram
you it's a little more subtle so this is the data and this little bump here is
is how we know that this Higgs particle existed this is a picture of Peter Higgs
being found so this was the final building block you know it was important it
was a really big deal and it was important for two reasons the first is
that this is what's responsible for what we call mass in the universe so the
properties of all the particles things like electric charge and mass are
really a statement about how their fields interact with other fields so the
property that we call electric charge of an electron is a statement about how
the electron field interacts with the electromagnetic field and the property
of its mass is the statement about how it interacts with the Higgs field so
understanding this was really the was needed so that we understand the meaning
of mass in the universe so it it was a big deal the other reason that it was a
big deal is this was the final piece of our jigsaw we had this theory that we
called the standard model we've had it since the 1970s this was the final thing
that we needed to discover to be sure that this theory is is correct and the
astonishing thing is this particle was predicted in the 1960s 50 years we've
been waiting we finally created it in CERN it behaves in exactly the way that
we thought it would absolutely perfectly behaves as we predicted using these
theories okay this is going to be the scary part of the talk you know I've
been telling you about this theory and I've been I've been waving my hands
pretending that I'm a field let me tell you what the theory really is let me
just show you what we do this is the equation for the standard model of
physics I don't expect you to understand it not least because there are parts of
this equation that no one on the planet understands but nonetheless I want to
show it to you for the following reason this equation correctly predicts the
result of every single experiment we've ever done in science everything is
contained in in this equation this is really the the pinnacle of the
reductionist approach to science it's it's all in here so you know I'll admit
it's not the simplest equation in the world but it's not the most complicated
either no you can put it on a t-shirt if you want to in fact if you go to CERN
you can buy a t-shirt with with with this equation on it let me just give you a
sense of what we're looking at the first term here was written down by Albert
Einstein and describes gravity what that means is that if you could solve
this tiny little part of the equation just this excuse me just this r you can for
example predict how fast an apple falls from a tree or the fact that the orbits
of the planet around the sun for my lips is or you can predict what happens when
two enormous black holes collide into each other and form a new black hole
sending out gravitational waves across the universe or in fact you can predict
how the entire universe itself expands all of this comes from solving this
little part of the equation that the next term in the equation was written
down by James Clark Maxwell and it tells you everything about electromagnetism
so all the experiment experiments that Faraday spent a lifetime doing in this
this building in fact all the experiments over many centuries from Coulomb to
Faraday to Hertz to modern developments of lasers everything in this tiny little
part of of the equation so there's some power in in these equations uh this is
the equation that governs the strong nuclear force the weak nuclear force
this is an equation that was first written down by a British physicist called Paul
Dirac uh it um it describes the matter describes those 12 particles that that
make up the matter astonishingly each of them obeys exactly the same equation
these are the equations of Peter Higgs and this is an equation that tells you
how the matter interacts with with the Higgs particle so everything is is in here
it's really an astonishing achievement this is our current limit of knowledge
we've never done an experiment that cannot be explained by this equation and we've
never found a way in which this equation stops working so this is the best thing that
we currently have okay it's the best thing that we currently have however we want to do better
because we know for sure that there's stuff out there that is not explained by this
and the reason we know is that although this explains every single experiment we've ever
done here on earth if we look out into the sky there's extra stuff which is still a mystery
so uh if we look out into space there are for example invisible particles out there in fact
there's many more invisible particles than there are visible particles we call them dark matter
we can't see them obviously because they're invisible uh but we can see their effects we
can see their effects on the way galaxies rotate or the way they bend light around galaxies they're
out there we don't know what they are um there's uh even more mysterious things there's something
called dark energy which is spread throughout all of space it's also some kind of field
although not one we understand that's causing everything in the universe to repel everything else
other things we know that uh early in the first few seconds earlier than that the first few
fractions of a second after the big bang the universe underwent a very rapid phase of expansion
that we call inflation we know it happened but it's not explained by that equation that i
i just showed you so these are the kind of things that we're going to have to understand
if we're going to move forward uh and decide what the next laws of physics are that go beyond
the standard model um i could tell you i could spend hours talking about either of the any of
these i'm going to focus just on the last one i'm going to tell you a little bit about um about
inflation um so uh the universe is 13.8 billion years old and uh we understand fairly well well
we don't understand at all how it started we don't understand what kicked it all off at time t
equals zero but we understand fairly well what happened after it started and we know in particular
that for the first um uh the first 380 000 years of the universe it was filled with a fireball
and we know this for sure because we've seen the fireball in fact we've seen it and we've
taken a photograph of it uh this um is called the cosmic microwave background radiation
but a much better name for it is the fireball that filled the universe uh when it was much younger
okay the fireball uh cooled down uh its light has been streaming through the universe for 13.8
billion years uh but we can see it we can take this photograph of it and um uh we can sort of
understand very well what was happening in these these first few moments of of the universe and
you can see it it looks literally like a fireball there there's red bits that are hotter there's
blue bits that are colder and by studying this flickering that you can see in this picture
we get a lot of information about what was going on back 13.8 billion years ago when the universe
was a baby one of the main questions we want to ask is what caused the flickering in the fireball
and um we have an answer to this we we have an answer which which i think is one of the most
astonishing things in in all of science um it turns out that although the universe last sorry
although the fireball lasted for 380 000 years uh whatever caused this flickering could not have
taken place during the vast majority of that time whatever caused the flickering in this fireball
actually took place in the first few very fractions of a second after the big bang and what it was
was the following so when the universe was very very young there was this uh uh when the
universe was very very young soon after the big bang there were no particles but there were
quantum fields because the quantum fields were everywhere and there were these quantum vacuum
fluctuations and what happened was the universe expanded very very quickly and it caught these
quantum fluctuations in the act so the quantum fluctuations were stretched across the entire
sky where they became frozen and it's these vacuum fluctuations here which are the ripples that you
see in the fireball so it's an astonishing story that the quantum vacuum fluctuations were taking
place 10 to the minus 30 seconds after the big bang they were absolutely microscopic and now
we see them stretched across the entire universe stretched 20 billion light years across the sky
that's what you're seeing here and yet you do the calculations for this and it matches perfectly
what you see here so this is another of the great triumphs of of quantum field theory but it leaves
lots of questions the most important one is which field are we seeing here uh which field is this
that's imprinted on on the the background radiation and the answer is we don't know the only one of
the standard model fields it has a hope of being is the Higgs but most of us think it's
not the Higgs but probably something new but what we'd like to do moving forward into the future
is get a much better picture of this fireball in particular get the polarization of the light
and by getting a picture of this we can understand much better the properties of this field
that was fluctuating in in the early universe okay this looking forward is one of the best hopes
that we have for going beyond the standard model and understanding new physics in the last 10 minutes
though i'd like to bring you back down to earth sort of we've got lots of experiments here on earth
where we're also trying to do better where we're also trying to go beyond the standard model of
physics beyond that equation to understand what's what's new and there's many of them but the most
prominent is the one i've already mentioned it's it's the LHC so what happened was uh the LHC
discovered the Higgs boson in 2012 and soon afterwards it closed down for two years uh it
had an upgrade and last year in 2015 the LHC turned on again with twice the energy that it had when
it discovered the Higgs and the goal was two-fold the goal was firstly to understand the Higgs better
which is done fantastically and secondly to discover new physics that lies beyond the Higgs new
physics beyond the standard model so before i tell you what um what it's seen uh let me tell you some
of the ideas we had some of our expectations and hopes for what would happen moving forward
so that this is our favorite equation again um the the idea has always been the following
you know if you're a Victorian scientist and you go back and you look at the periodic table
of elements then it's true that there's patterns in there that give a hint of the structure that
lies underneath okay there's numbers that that repeat themselves where if you're very smart you
might start to realize that you know yes there is something deeper than than than just these elements
so our hope as theorists is to look at this equation and see if maybe we can just find patterns
in this equation that suggests there might be something deeper that that lies underneath
and they're there so let me give you an example this is the equation uh that describes the force
of electricity and magnetism and it's almost the same as the equations which describe the forces
for the strong force and the weak nuclear force okay in fact you can see i've just changed letters
okay it's a little more complicated than that but it's not it's not much more complicated than that
the three forces really look similar so you might wonder well maybe there's not three forces in
the universe maybe those three forces are actually just one force and when we think there's three
forces it's because we're looking at that one force just from slightly different perspectives
maybe here's something else which is amazing these are the equations uh for the 12 matter fields
in the universe the neutrinos the electrons and the quarks each of them obeys exactly the same
equation each of them obeys the dirac equation so again you might wonder that well maybe there
aren't 12 different fields maybe they're all uh the same field and the same particle and the fact
they look different is again maybe just because we're looking at them from slightly different
perspectives maybe so uh these ideas that i've been suggesting go by the name of unification
the idea that the three forces are actually combined into one is what's called grand unification
and it's very easy it's very easy to write down a mathematical theory in which all of these
are just one force which which appears to be three from our our perspective okay there are other
possibilities here you might say well this is the matter and these are the forces and the equations
are different but they're not that different because ultimately they're both just fields
so you might wonder if maybe there's some way in which the matter and the forces are related
to each other well uh we have a theory for that as well it's a theory that's called supersymmetry
and uh it's a beautiful theory it's very deep conceptually um and it sort of you know smells
like it might be right finally you might be really really bold you might say uh well can I just
combine the lot can i just get rid of all of these terms and just write down one single term from
which everything else emerges gravity the forces the particles the higgs everything well i've got
something for you if you want that as well it's called string theory so we have a possibility for
a theory which contains all of this in one simple concept and the question going forward of course
is are these right you know it's very easy for us theorists to have these ideas and i should say
these ideas of what's driven theoretical physics for 30 years but we want to know are they right
and uh we've got a way of telling them right we do experiments so i should say if you want to
know if string theory is right uh we don't have any way to test it at the moment but if you want to
know if some of these other ideas are right then that's what the lhc should be doing the reason
that we built the lhc was firstly to find the higgs okay it worked and secondly to test these
kind of ideas that we've been having to see what lies beyond so the lhc has been running it's been
running for two years it's been running like an absolute dream it's just it's a perfect machine
two years this is what it's seen absolutely nothing okay all of these fantastic beautiful
ideas that we've had none of them are showing up at all and the question going forward is you know
what are we going to do about it you know how are we going to make progress in understanding the
next layer of physics when the lhc isn't seeing anything and our ideas just just don't appear to be
the way that nature works okay i should tell you off and i don't have a good answer to this
it's uh i said my impression is that most of my community is a little bit shell shocked by
by what happened there's certainly no consensus in the community to move forward but i think there's
three responses that that sort of various people have had that i'd like to share with you i think
all three of these responses are reasonable up to a point um the first response to the lhc not
seeing anything is the following it's um well you know you you you young kids you're so pessimistic
it's all doom and gloom with you you just you need a little bit more patience you know it didn't see
anything last year and it didn't see anything this year but but next year it's going to see something
and if not next year it's the year after that that it's going to see something okay it's it's
usually my my very illustrious senior colleagues that that have this this response and you know
what they could easily be right it could easily be that next year the lhc discovers something
astonishing and it sets us on the path to understanding the next layer of layer of reality
but it's also true that these same people were predicting that it would have seen something by
now and it's also true that um this can't keep going for much longer if the lhc doesn't see something
within say a two-year timescale it seems very very unlikely that it's going to see something
moving forward it's possible it just seems unlikely so uh you know we'll know i i hope with all my
heart that the lhc discovers something next year or the year after um but i think we have to prepare
for for the worst that that maybe it won't okay response number two uh response number two which
is sort of also by by similar people um uh well all our theories are so beautiful they absolutely
have to be correct and what we really need is a bigger machine okay uh ten times bigger we'll we'll
do it okay again they they they might be right i don't have a good argument against it uh the
obvious rebuttal however is that a new machine costs ten billion dollars and there's not too many
governments in the world that have ten billion dollars to spare for us to uh us us to explore
these ideas there's one uh the one is china and so if this machine is going to be built at all
it's going to be built by the chinese government i think the chinese government would would see it
as extremely attractive if the whole community of uh particle physicists and engineers that are
currently based in cern and geneva uh move to a town that's slightly north of beijing i think i
think they'd uh view that as a political and economic gain and there's you know a real chance
that they may decide to build this machine if they do it's about 20 years uh for it to be built
so uh we're waiting slightly longer uh there's a third response um and i should say the third
response is is kind of the camp i'm in um i should mention upfront it's speculative
and it's probably not endorsed by most of most of my peers so this is really just my personal
opinion at at this point um this is my take on on this um this is you know uh this is the equation
that uh uh we know is right this is sort of the bedrock of our our understanding but although we
know it's right there's an awful lot in this equation that we haven't understood there's an
awful lot to me that's still mysterious in this equation so although this equation looked like
there were suggestions of unification maybe they're just red herrings and maybe if we just
work harder and try and to understand this equation more we'll find that uh there are
other patterns that emerge so my response is i think that maybe we should just go back to the
drawing board and uh start to challenge some of the assumptions and paradigms that that we've
been holding for for the past 30 years so i i should admit i i feel quite energized actually
by the lack of results for the LHC you know i i sort of it feels good to me that everyone was
was wrong you know it's when we're wrong that we start to make make progress uh so i i sort of feel
quite happy by this about this um and think that um you know there's a very real chance that we could
just you know start thinking about different ideas i should say that you know there are hints
in here there are hints to me about you know mathematical patterns that we haven't explored
that there's hints in this about connections to other areas of science things like condensed
metaphysics which is the science of how materials work or quantum information science which is uh
the attempt to build a quantum computer all of these fantastic subjects have have new ideas
which sort of feed in to the kind of questions that that we're asking here so i'm quite optimistic
that moving forward uh we can make progress maybe not the progress that we thought we'd
make a few years ago but just uh just something new um so that's the punchline of my talk the
punchline is that uh this is the single greatest equation uh that we've ever written down uh but
i hope that someday uh we can give you something better thank you for your attention
there's nothing discreet about the schrodinger equation the schrodinger equation is is something
you know to do with a smoother field like like wave function uh the discreteness is something
which emerges when you solve the schrodinger equation so it's not built into the heart of nature
