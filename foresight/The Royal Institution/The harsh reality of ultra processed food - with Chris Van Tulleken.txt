5, we use the word obesity in its adjectival form, people are obese. So obesity and identity are conflated, and so when we tackle obesity if we say that food is the problem, the people who eat it can quickly become the problem as we see in this headline from The Daily Express.

in the Guardian, the Long Read on Ultra Processed Food,
which had huge influence on me.
So you can read about Ultra Processed Food
and I would encourage you to engage with it.
Cos that was the experiment that I did
when I was writing the book,
as I went on a month-long diet of ultra-processed food.
I didn't do that.
Cazually, I didn't do it as a stunt for a telly programme.
I did it to gather pilot data for a much bigger study
that we're now running at UCL.
So I did it with the help of very expert colleagues.

On ni efallai ei ailyn nad yna rhiall fwyaf saedd,
of comparative size, some of them.
Humans compared to other animals of similar size and weight.
We have tiny jaws, minuscule teeth and very short digestive tracts.
We have extended our gastrointestinal system,
our digestive system out into our kitchens.
We use grinders and knives to chop and cut our food
instead of our teeth and our jaws.
We use cooking and processing and mashing and extracting
to make our food much more easy to digest.
Modern food was invented primarily by female scientists
over hundreds of millennia.
They worked in caves and leaf shelters and huts
and then modern kitchens to invent the modern diet.
It involved a huge amount of processing.
For over a million years we've been cooking food
and for hundreds of thousands of years we've been grinding it and mashing it
and extracting it and salting it and curing it
and fermenting it and smoking it
and doing all of these wonderful things that make diets edible and delicious.
We're very sure that every traditional diet that we've ever studied
is associated with really good health.
You can go to East Asia and look at pescaterian diets
or South Asia and look at vegan diets.
You can go to the high Arctic and look at diets
that comprise mainly fats from sea mammals
and are primarily carnivorous diets.
All of them seem to be associated with good health.
Of course there's the Mediterranean diet as well.
What we've never been able to do is to extract any molecule
from any of those diets and show that it has any benefit in healthy people.
That's really, really important.
When we talk about food, I'm much less interested in individual products
or individual components of food than I am in a dietary pattern.
The food we eat is we never eat individual food.
Whenever we're talking about food, people always want to know,
is broccoli healthier than burgers?
If you're on a desert island, you'd be much, much better off eating burgers.
You could live your entire life on burgers.
If the meat was rare, it would have vitamin C in it.
They're a good source of all kinds of things.
They've got loads of calories. You wouldn't live long on broccoli.
Broccoli is deficient in all kinds of essential fats.
It's very low in protein.
Yet broccoli forms a key part of a really healthy balanced diet
in a way that an ultra-processed burger wouldn't.
Processing is ancient, therefore, and has shaped our genes, our physiology,
but ultra-processing is very different.
So we have now entered what in my book I describe as the third age of eating.
In the first age of eating, creatures, microorganisms ate stuff
that had never been alive, bugs ate rocks.
In the second age of eating, people eat food.
So organisms created a shortcut where we eat things that have been alive.
The second age of eating continues today.
You can go into any big supermarket and you can buy things that used to be alive
and you can assemble them at home into a diet.
But ultra-processed food is where we eat things that have never been in our diet before,
and I'm going to explain what they are.
Using photos in these talks, especially about weight and diet,
can be really stigmatising.
The only people I'm going to stigmatise are my own two kids, that's Sasha.
She's now three, and she is very much a child of the ultra-processed food age.
She's grown up eating lots of it.
There, she's eating ultra-processed food.
It's ultra-processed cat food, so this is now a huge fan of it.
And I have friends who work, lots of friends in the food industry,
our friends who have worked in the pet food divisions
and moved over to the human food divisions.
And we use the same flavouring technologies in both.
So ways of getting pets to like food, great ways of getting kids to like food.
And Sasha was a huge fan of this particular.
It was a kibble for cats with poor dentition.
Anyway, so there she is.
And you may find I've got a lot of messages from people who, having engaged with the book,
have switched their perpetually hungry domestic pets to whole food.
And it's very expensive to do it.
There are environmental concerns about doing it.
But they found a lot of their pets become much more satisfied eating real foods.
That's anecdote.
So what is ultra-processed food?
I'm happy to talk more about the controversy about the definition.
In fact, the definition in terms of independent scientists is extremely widely agreed on.
UNICEF, who I work with, the World Health Organization,
who I'm on an expert advisory panel for,
research groups at Harvard, Oxford, my group at University College in London, Cambridge,
all over the world have agreed that this is a great and useful way
of defining a category of food.
It came out of work in Brazil.
Don't worry about trying to read this, by the way.
I'm putting it up there to make it clear
that the definition is extremely long.
If it's too long, didn't read,
here's a really good working definition that some of you will know, of course.
Wrapped in plastic with at least one ingredient
you wouldn't normally find in a standard home kitchen.
It's almost certainly ultra-processed.
The definition came out of a research group in Brazil led by someone by called Carlos Montero.
And a lot of the best work on UPF has been done by research groups in South and Central America.
Because in lots of countries, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile,
they found that in a very short space of time,
obesity and metabolic disease like type 2 diabetes
went from being essentially unheard of.
They just didn't really exist to in the space of around a decade
being the dominant public health problem.
And the only thing that had happened was the incursion
of a Western American industrialized diet
where most of the calories were coming from ultra-processed food.
So it was a really, really powerful natural experiment.
Carlos Montero was a very senior nutritional professor in Brazil.
He's a medical doctor as well.
And he collected the data and derived this definition
from the data that he was seeing in the public health research that he was doing.
So the definition is very long.
There was a bit of social theory baked into this.
I'll expand the definition a bit.
But in paragraph 9, it makes it clear that the purpose,
part of the purpose of the food is profit,
that we make this food so it is easily marketed and easy to sell.
So this was a huge paradigm shift in nutrition
because everyone here in this room, I would bet,
has thought for most of your life about nutrition
in terms of about four things,
salt, sugar and carbs, fat, protein and fiber.
Those are the things that our food is made up of
and that's the way our food is labelled.
And that's what nutrition is.
It's about the nutritional components.
Carlos Montero was proposing that food is more than the sum of its component parts,
that what we do to the food actually matters.
And this was revolutionary and we're going to see why.
So we're having a conversation where we need sensitivity,
kindness, nuance, scientific sophistication
and to use lots of different silo knowledge.
So I thought, who better to turn to for this kind of thought
than the words of former and perhaps future President Donald Trump?
Donald Trump was one of the early adopters of the idea
that ultra-processing had a significant effect on human health.
So in 2012 he sent out a series of tweets.
I won't do an impression.
No, I really want to.
I've never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
The next day he sent out another one.
The more Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, et cetera that you drink,
the more weight you gain.
The next day another one.
Diet Coke tweet had a monster response.
Damn it, I wish the stuff worked.
The next day, the Coca-Cola company is not happy with me.
That's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
Then he let it rest for a few days and came back with, I think,
a tweet that in just 140 characters, less than 140 characters,
sums up more than a decade later the state of the art,
the state of the science that we now have about non-nutritive sweetness.
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke, soda.
Let's face it, this stuff just doesn't work.
It makes you hungry.
Now he's, that was the face he pulled as he sent the tweet.
So my proposition to you is if you can understand Diet Coke
and how it interacts with your body,
then you're a long way into understanding what ultra-processed food is.
This is Diet Coke labelling from the United Kingdom,
but this is more or less how it's marketed around the world.
This is, this gets four green traffic lights on the bottle.
So this isn't just a health food.
This is the healthiest product you can possibly buy.
Very few foods get four green traffic lights.
It's a sparkling, low-calorie soft drink with vegetable extracts with sweetness.
Let's read the ingredients.
Carbonated water, fine.
Now caramel E150D might make you think of creme brulee,
of traditional treats of 19th century French cooking.
In fact, it has nothing to do with caramel.
It's carbohydrate being put through a set of industrial processes
using chemical modifications with acids, alkalis and heat.
It contains ammonia, contains sulfites,
and you can read more about it on the WHO Committee on Food Additives website.
There are sweeteners, aspartame and asasulfame K.
Now, aspartame hit the headlines recently because of concerns
that it seems to be carcinogenic.
There's some nuance about that.
I'm not very concerned about its carcinogenic properties.
Much more important was a very significant paper
published in one of the world's leading scientific journals this summer, Cell.
It was an analysis of what the non-nutritive,
we call them artificial, but the natural ones do the same thing.
It's what non-nutritive sweeteners do to our health.
We now think that if you look at the independent studies,
the non-industry funded ones,
there is something that seems to be really tricky for the body.
When you put sweet taste on the tongue,
which you haven't just evolved for fun, right?
We've really evolved a sophisticated internal system
for detecting what food does.
When you taste sweetness on your tongue,
it prepares your body to receive sugar,
to receive refined carbohydrates.
Humans have been eating significant quantities of refined carbohydrates
for many, many millennia.
When that sugar doesn't arrive, it seems to cause problems.
People used to think that the problem was that you released insulin
and that dropped your blood glucose,
because insulin lowers blood glucose,
and that made you hungry,
and you then went and ate more carbohydrates,
and that might be why they don't seem to promote weight loss.
It seems now, from the research this summer,
that a lot of them actually increase your blood glucose,
and we're not really sure why that is.
It may be part of a stress response.
The brain is a prediction engine.
It's constantly making predictions about the world.
When you get a mismatch between a prediction,
like sugar is on its way and the sugar doesn't arrive,
there may be a stress response.
No one really knows, but the artificial sweeteners,
according to the World Health Organization,
and I think the best evidence,
don't seem to be metabolically superior to sugar,
and they don't seem to be linked to significant weight loss,
and that is a huge problem.
There are natural flavorings, including caffeine.
I mean, I would frame caffeine as an addictive stimulant,
but whatever you like.
There's phosphoric acid.
Now, it's particularly significant
for the people born women in the audience.
Phosphoric acid doesn't just dissolve your teeth.
It can also leach minerals out of your bones
and reduce bone density and citric acid
will also dissolve your teeth.
This is not a healthy product.
It will not help anyone lose weight.
It is a way of commodifying ill health.
I would frame it as.
So let's look at the logic of UPF.
This is what I want you all to start doing.
In fact, what I'm sure you will all start doing
is you're going to go out of here
and you can start reading ingredients packets.
Some of you may already be obsessively doing this
because there's been a lot of coverage about UPF
in the last six months.
You will notice that themes, tropes emerge
as you read these ingredients lists.
They all start with commodity crops.
We only eat a tiny number of plants.
Our carbs come from four plants, rice, corn, soy, and wheat.
They might be mixed with some commodity oils.
There's a short list of them.
There's palm, sunflower, some mixed vegetable oils.
You take those crops and you...
This is the Mato Grosso in Brazil, by the way.
That's primary forest on the right of the picture.
Then on the left is the soy plantations.
You grow these crops at scale.
They're often fed to animals, corn, soy.
They're animal food.
You take leftovers and to add value to them,
you put them into the human food chain.
You break your crop, whether it's corn or soy,
you break it down into powders of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
They have a nearly infinite shelf life
and they cost very, very little.
You can ship them all over the world in enormous quantities.
Now, to make them edible again,
you can mix them with a little bit of meat if you want.
We eat three animals mainly.
You could mix them with some fish,
but primarily we just eat beef, chicken, and pork.
But you then need the additives.
In the UK and in Europe,
we have around 2,500 additives that we use in food
and they're somewhat regulated.
In the United States, there are between 5,000 and 15,000 additives.
No one has a list.
The FDA, who regulate or supposed to regulate additives,
don't have a list of all the additives that are added to food.
But the additives broadly, the ones you'll notice,
is they emulsify and they stabilize.
They bind those basic ingredients together
and they create textures
and then you can press them, extrude them, fry them, bake them,
and turn them into any shape you want.
These ingredient lists will be the same from your breads,
to your cakes, to your puddings, to your pizzas, to your ready meals.
They will all have the same basic ingredients patterns.
Cheap crop additives to make it edible.
So, let's look at some example.
Now, some ultra-processed food is really kind of obvious.
I've used the word junk there.
It's a bit pejorative about Miss Molly's,
but some of it we might casually refer to as junk food.
And you'll see there on that list of ingredients,
we start with some dairy fat
and then there's this reconstituted whey powder.
Whey powder was a waste byproduct of the dairy industry for a long time.
Adding it used to be spread on fields or fed to animals.
Now, if you can add it to food, it has huge value.
Glucose syrup, sugar, dextrose,
so three different kinds of sugar.
Palm steering, palm oil, palm kernel oil, different oils.
Emulsified, stabilised, flavoured and coloured.
Palm oil, of course, is a traditional ingredient.
Many of you may have eaten it.
It's used widely across Western Central Africa where I've eaten it.
There's a bottle of it there.
The palm oil, palm steering or palm fat
you'll see on your biscuits
and in almost everything you can read
is nothing to do with that spicy red traditional liquid
that you see there on your left.
It's been through an edible oil refinery.
There's a picture there in the middle.
They look like crude oil refineries
and it's termed into that palm steering on the left.
So using processes of refining, bleaching,
deodorising, interesterifying and hydrogenating,
you can take any oil you want from any palm.
You'll see mango kernel oil on your biscuits.
You'll see sheer oil.
You'll see coconut fats.
You'll see palm fats.
You put it through the RBD process
and you can create any melting point, any texture,
anything you want and it all tastes of nothing.
So it becomes a way of adding fat to food
that is extraordinarily cheap.
But a lot of ultra processed food is sold to us as being healthy.
So I've used a neat natural bar
but almost all of these snack bars
that are marketed to us are in fact ultra processed.
There's a nutrient-grain bar.
Marketed as strawberry.
There's a picture of a strawberry there.
It's just 5% strawberry.
And it's that same list of cereal flowers, vegetable oils, sugars,
all stabilised and emulsified together.
This might be my favourite example
because this was my favourite sandwich for a long time.
And this is a brand that we associate with organic food, with good health.
And I'm constantly having a debate
about what the riskiest kind of ultra processed food is.
Is it the stuff that we know is harmful for us?
Or is it this stuff that we think is probably quite healthy
which contains mono and diacetal tartaric acid esters
of mono and diglycerides of fatty acids?
And that's Datum.
That's one of the most common emulsifiers
that means that almost all the bread you buy in a supermarket
will be ultra processed food.
In the UK, ultra processed food is now most of what we eat.
60% of our calories come from ultra processed food.
80% is typical for teens.
One in five people in this country get 80% of their calories
from ultra processed food.
For many, many people, particularly those living in disadvantage,
those with low incomes,
this is the only food that is available
and it's the only food that's affordable.
And we have libraries of data on that.
And there's often a politician who is happy to explain to us
that lentils or porridge are very cheap to buy.
You can make a meal out of pasta and some tomatoes.
And what's never factored into that calculation
is the fact that you need energy to cook that food.
You need skills, you need a chopping board, you need a knife.
You need to make it in quantity.
No one makes a bowl of pasta.
You need to make it in quantity.
Put it in some tupperware that you need to buy.
Stick it in a chest freezer that you don't have.
Real food is fantastically expensive.
It spoils very quickly and time is money.
It takes a long time to prepare it.
So never let anyone tell you that real food can be made cheaply.
It is enormously expensive.
So what are the effects on our health?
The most important effect that most of us are concerned with
is it seems to cause unhealthy weight gain.
And this is a really important study.
So lots of the evidence I'm going to show you
is epidemiological.
It's population studies.
Now the best evidence we have in science
is when we do randomised control trials.
And this was a really excellent randomised control trial
undertaken by a guy called Kevin Hall,
who's one of the world's leading nutritional scientists.
He's an ex-physicist.
He works in the States at the National Institutes of Health.
And he did what's called a crossover design.
So it was as if we took this room, he used fewer people,
and we cut you in half.
And we said, you guys are all going to eat an unprocessed diet for two weeks.
And you're going to be locked in our lab,
and you're going to have an unprocessed diet,
and you're going to have access to 5,000 calories a day.
And you guys are going to eat an ultra-processed diet for two weeks.
And you're also going to have access to 5,000 calories a day.
So you all get far more food than you could possibly want.
And the two diets are the same for fat, salt, sugar and fibre.
And the two diets are equally delicious.
And you all agreed on this.
You've all tried it, and you all say the same thing.
And after two weeks are up, you're all going to swap over,
and we're going to see what happens.
And these are pictures of the diets.
And I know Kevin, and I've said to Kevin,
it looks almost like you tried to rig it
because lots of people would much rather eat the food
that's on your right than on your left.
And Kevin said, well, that actually isn't at all.
We really studied hard and did lots of focus group testing
to make sure that both plates were equally palatable.
And this is what happened.
This is just the weight graft.
You can see that just over two weeks
there was almost a kilogram weight change
for the two groups in opposite directions
over just two weeks.
The group on the ultra-process diet
ate around 500 calories more per day,
despite saying the food was equally delicious,
despite the fact that both diets had the same amount of salt,
fat, sugar and fibre.
So there is something beyond the salt, fat, sugar and fibre,
and something beyond the amount that people liked it
that was driving this excess consumption.
But ultra-process food doesn't just cause obesity.
Now, I'm using the word cause here
because I think the evidence we have
has met the threshold for causality.
And I'm happy to discuss,
I think this is probably a pretty scientifically literate audience,
what we should probably say
is that ultra-process food is strongly associated
with this very long list of different diseases,
cardiovascular disease, cancers, all cancers,
but particularly breast, prostate and colon,
metabolic disease like type 2 diabetes,
obesity, high blood pressure, gestational diabetes,
fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease,
anxiety depression, frailty, irritable bowel syndrome
and lots of those other gastrointestinal complaints
that we all just think are part of growing old
and being a normal 45-year-old,
dementia and an increased risk of early death.
And this is a paper published by my PhD student,
Sam Dickin.
It's a really important study.
What Sam did is a formal review
and every single one of the studies
that is used to generate that evidence
controlled for fat, salt, sugar, fibre and dietary pattern.
They also control for educational standards
and poverty and gender and age.
So, while those studies have flaws,
no epidemiology is perfect,
it's really hard to correct for all those biases.
We have very, very good evidence
that there is more than just fat, salt, sugar and fibre
that is mediating these harmful effects.
Processing is important
and that this is a revolutionary way of thinking about food
should, I think, surprise all of you.
Perhaps the best example of why processing is important
was an experiment done in the 70s
by a group in Bristol.
It was a very simple experiment.
They got some apples and they left them unprocessed
and they chopped them into chunks
and then they pureed them
and then they pureed them and squashed the fibre out.
They looked at the effects of the nutrient
and they did it all immediately before participants drank or ate them.
What we see is that when you eat a whole apple,
you feel much fuller for much longer.
Do get it if you need to, don't worry about me.
If you eat a whole apple,
it doesn't spike your blood sugar
and you don't get a sort of rebound hypoglycemia.
If you drink the apple juice, you get a big spike of blood sugar,
you don't feel full at all.
When you back add the fibre so it's whole, pureed apple,
you still get that sugar spike.
You still don't feel satisfied.
Even when we have a pureed whole apple,
it's very, very different to eating the whole apple,
to dismantling the apple with your teeth.
Eating, the act of chewing, of manipulating food with your tongue,
causes all sorts of internal physiological changes
that are really, really important.
We do need to process food with our mouths.
Processing does affect nutrition.
Before we go on, when we're talking about obesity,
we have to address some elephants
because there are some other proposed causes of pandemic obesity.
If I'm here saying the primary cause, perhaps not the entire cause,
but the primary cause of the obesity change
that we've seen since the 1970s,
where childhood obesity was around 1% or 2%,
the fact that obesity in childhood is now more than 20%,
around a 10-fold increase,
that that 10-fold increase is due to ultra-processed food,
I have to answer some questions.
You should all have some questions.
What about exercise? Exercise is medicine.
We've all become far less active.
Jobs have become automated.
None of us work in heavy industry.
Very few of us are out tilling fields.
Even farmers get to sit in mechanised processes these days.
So it seems very obvious
that if we live more active lives,
we must surely burn more calories.
That's a picture of me filming a television series
I did a very long time ago
that some of you may have seen are called Medicine Men Go Wild.
My brother and I went and lived with remote,
indigenous peoples all around the world
to learn about their food and their diet
and their medicine.
We got far more out.
We learned far more from these communities
than we could possibly ever give them.
So I went and lived as a hunter-gatherer
in the rainforest at the borders
between Brazzaville, Congo
and Central African Republic
for several months.
A scientist called Herman Ponzer did quite a similar thing.
He went to live with Hadza hunter-gatherers in Tanzania.
The question he wanted to answer was,
how much more calories do they burn than we burn?
It seems very obvious that hunter-gatherers would burn more.
What he found was that for someone of the same sex,
body composition and age,
they don't seem to burn any more calories
when they're running 14km a day hunting antelope
or digging tubers out of the ground.
He was so puzzled by this data.
He went back and re-analysed it all.
Then he reviewed the literature.
We have studies going back to the 1990s.
Some of them compare subsistence farmers
to match populations in the states
and find exactly the same thing.
The subsistence farmers don't burn many more calories.
In fact, all the studies we've ever done
using a technique called the double-labeled water technique
have shown more or less the same thing.
The long-term increases in activity that we do for a very long time
don't seem to substantially increase the number of calories we burn.
This would seem, especially in this setting,
to violate the laws of physics,
but Ponsa came up with a really, really good theoretical explanation
of why this seems to be true.
Exercise is good for us,
not because we burn more calories,
but because we steal calories from other budgets.
I'm an 85kg, 45-year-old man.
I burn around 3,000 calories a day.
I do that whether I'm here or in Tanzania.
If I were to move to Tanzania,
I would spend many of those calories moving around,
preparing food, hunting food, gathering food.
In the UK, I still spend the calories,
but I'm not moving.
I seem to spend them on inflammation and anxiety
and on hormone levels that may be quite toxic.
There's lots and lots of data coalescing around this.
Ponsa's theory makes sense in two ways.
First of all, it explains evolutionary,
something really, really important,
that when food is scarce,
you wouldn't burn more calories to get it.
It would be really peculiar if we had evolved
in times of scarcity to have to expend more energy
gathering scarce food.
Instead, we steal from reproductive budgets.
We steal from immune budgets.
It's coherent with evolution.
It also explains why exercise is good for us
and the benefit we all feel,
which is that it damps down inflammation, pain, anxiety,
and has all these other benefits.
It also explains all the data
and the lived experience I'm sure of people here.
Exercise isn't a great way of losing weight.
We've done lots of trials of this.
You can show it's quite a good way of helping to maintain weight loss,
but it's not a great way of promoting weight loss.
He made a huge contribution to the literature.
That was published in Science,
and it's really, really robust science.
There's some details that need tidying up,
but it is very robust.
I should say some exceptions.
I've also done Arctic Exploration,
or if we look at elite athletes,
they do burn more calories.
You can increase your calorific expenditure briefly.
You just can't do it for very long.
Exercise, if you do it intensively at a high level,
you will burn more calories.
Where does this idea...
Because I was very surprised by this.
Where did my idea, as someone who spent six years at medical school,
I spent five years doing a PhD,
and I was sure this wasn't the way I understood the body,
and I think it's probably not the way you will understand the body.
What about that idea that exercise, you know,
calories in, calories out,
that the obesity pandemic is partly due to inactivity?
Well, the exercise's medicine phrase is actually trademarked.
It's trademarked by the Coca-Cola company.
It was a partnership with the American College of Sports Medicine and Coca-Cola.
It was a huge public health program.
And some colleagues of mine at the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine,
very senior group of scientists there, particularly Marty McKee,
they did a network analysis
to look at Coca-Cola's scientific funding.
Because they noticed Coca-Cola were funding scientific conferences.
They did some freedom of information requests.
There are hundreds of papers in the scientific literature,
all of them promoting this idea of energy balance
that we can drink some fizzy calorific liquid
and then we can run it off.
And this is why Coke sponsors so many different sporting events.
So the entire understanding of calories in, calories out
in part comes from this network of research funded by Coca-Cola.
There's very little other evidence to support it.
And I would say that the best people in nutrition,
when it comes to obesity,
no one serious believes that inactivity is a significant contributor to pandemic obesity.
What about willpower?
We hear a lot about willpower.
Now, what I want to do is equip you as a room
to destroy people who bring up willpower.
Who say that, well, they often mix it in with calories in, calories out.
It's just all about effort and people who don't live with obesity
have the daily experience that they use a bit of willpower to just decline the food.
It's entirely untrue. That, by the way, is my daughter Sasha.
She's not blessed with any amount of willpower.
What you're looking at there is some US data,
and you don't have to look at the details of the graph,
but it's a graph of prevalence of obesity by date.
And you'll see there's a sudden inflection point
where all those lines on the graph go up in the mid-70s.
That's when weight gain took off.
Now, there are different lines on the graph
because they're men and women of different ages.
Now, that's a graph of the Caucasian part of the population,
but the graphs for black groups and Hispanic groups look exactly the same.
So, at some point in the mid-1970s,
something happened which made everyone across every age,
both genders across all demographics, start to gain weight at the same time.
Now, unless you propose that simultaneously there was some failure of moral responsibility
in all those different communities,
the willpower argument doesn't stack up.
It really doesn't.
We have a huge amount of data that willpower is usually a proxy for poverty.
People who live in poverty make very, very sensible decisions,
and particularly a lot of...
Many of you may have heard of this experiment, the marshmallow test,
where you give a child a marshmallow and you say,
if you don't eat the marshmallow, I'm going to leave the room.
If you don't eat the marshmallow, when I come back, you can have another marshmallow.
And the children who are unable to resist the marshmallow,
as they were followed over a very long time period,
and this predicted an awful lot about their life courses,
predicted their jobs, their incomes, and their weight.
And so this provided this evidence that people without willpower do seem to gain weight.
In fact, there was a re-analysis of the data,
and there's a lot of nuance around this,
so I say this with some caution.
But when the data was re-analyzed,
what they hadn't controlled for was the educational level of the mothers.
And essentially, if you are born into poverty,
you make the sensible decision to take rewards when they are available,
because often, in context of poverty and deprivation, promises aren't fulfilled.
And so you're really smart to take that marshmallow.
The kids were making smart choices.
When you adjusted for that, the effect more or less went away.
Willpower is something we have very few ways of measuring.
It's not an interesting part of this discussion.
My patients who have lost weight have frequently lost their own body weight many times over.
They exhibit far more willpower every day than I do.
Personal responsibility, especially in terms of policy, has no place
in this discussion.
What about stress and genes?
This comes up a lot, because I have, whether it's patients or friends,
a lot of people say to me, look, I know you think it's UPF,
but I eat for emotional reasons.
I eat because I'm traumatised. I eat when I'm stressed.
Well, I suppose this food is a little like tobacco in that sense.
It's one of the ways that the harms of poverty, of stress, of trauma are made manifest.
It's always the ultra-processed products that people eating for emotional reasons turn to.
In the same way, tobacco products or drugs of abuse or alcohol,
those are the substances that people turn to.
I'll talk more about addiction.
The deep cause of a huge amount of the pandemic of diet-related disease is poverty,
but it is the marketing of ultra-processed food, along with the marketing of gambling,
tobacco, alcohol products, these other harmful substances,
that causes the proximal harm.
But if we could fix poverty, we would deal with the data shows
around about half of the problem.
Poverty, I think, is a political choice that we can deal with.
I hope I've persuaded you that UPF does harm us,
that it is the primary driver,
and that those other questions that swirl around the debate and confuse us
can actually, we can use evidence to get rid of them pretty effectively.
But how does ultra-processed food cause its harms?
Well, one of the effects is it's very soft.
It's very soft and it's very energy-dense.
The way of testing this is to go and buy a loaf of this kind of bread,
and I've put up hovis because this is the bread that I've always used to buy,
and go and buy a loaf of sourdough or rye bread or any traditional real bread.
And what you'll find is the emulsified supermarket bread
takes about twice as long or three times as long.
Sorry, it's about three times quicker to eat.
It's very fast to eat.
Now, the softness has two effects.
Partly there's a particle-sized difference.
We absorb ultra-processed food very, very quickly
because all the bits of real food have been fractionated down
virtually into their molecular constituents.
But it also means we eat it very, very fast.
And we have very, very good data going back to the 1990s,
that soft food that is quickly consumed is strongly linked with weight gain,
especially when that food is energy-dense.
And the other thing about ultra-processed food, it is bone-dry.
Real food is wet.
Almost all the real food you can think of has moisture in it.
Now, moisture is a problem if you want something to have a long shelf life,
and long shelf life is vital for cost.
So there are illusions of wetness in ultra-processed food.
If you think of a moist burger and there are those famous,
there's lots of instances on social media of people buying burgers
from popular burger restaurants and leaving them in their packets
and photographing them over a year, and nothing happens.
They don't decompose.
In fact, those burgers, they don't contain many preservatives.
They're just dry, and dry things, bugs can't get a grip on dry things.
Dry goods don't decompose.
So the dryness, the water isn't there.
They're very energy-dense because the water should displace energy.
They're drying this off, so we eat them quickly.
We get calories quicker than our bodies can say we're full.
And remember, we do all have an internal mechanism
that is able to say, I am full.
There is no obesity in wild animals,
and that is not to do with scarcity of food.
Many animals live with very plentiful food,
but they have homeostatic mechanisms.
The first thing we all learn in biology is homeostasis.
We all have a way of keeping all of our internal physiology the same.
Our temperature, our blood pressure, our oxygen levels,
our carbon dioxide levels, our blood pH, our sodium, our potassium,
we regulate it all tightly.
It would be bizarre if we didn't do the same for calorie intake,
and we can if we eat real food.
UPF tells us lies.
So there's sweetness without sugar,
but there's also smoothness without fat.
So around the 1980s, when fat became the first big molecule
to start to be demonised, we replaced all the fat.
So we had the evolution of low-fat mayonnaise.
Some of that was just to save money.
Some of it was because you can make a health claim.
If you can replace a dairy fat with a modified starch,
or xanthan gum, or guar gum,
you can actually, if you're skillful and the scientists at the food companies are,
you can create fatty textures in the mouth,
the sliminess of fat, but without any real fat there.
Again, your mouth isn't just tasting stuff for fun.
Taste is an early warning system.
So you've got bitter tastes, which identify toxins.
That's why most poisonous things are bitter.
Most plant toxins are bitter.
You've got sweet to identify sugar.
We think your mouth is able to detect fat,
and so if you have a slippery gum, but no fat arrives,
we think that will be a problem.
And we have savoury taste without protein.
So many of you will be familiar with umami.
There's also another savoury taste called kukami.
These tastes come from free amino acids and other similar molecules
that you get in the mouth.
And they taste savoury, and they should be present.
They're present in cheese, they're present in ramen broths,
they're present throughout amazing food,
and they signal particular nutrition is coming into the body.
When you get the flavour enhancers,
the synergistic umami of glutamate, inesate, and guanylate
that you find in huge numbers of potato crisps,
when those molecules arrive in the context of potato starch
and say real protein never arises,
we think that also drives excess consumption,
and you may be familiar with some of these products
once you pop you can't stop slogan,
and that may be part of what's driving that.
It's flavoured.
UPF has to be flavoured because flavour comes from a huge range
of different aromatic molecules,
and by the time you've processed the basic ingredients,
they don't really have flavour, so you have to back-add flavour.
So the flavouring is a proxy for a lack of phyto-nutrients.
If you look at the number of chemicals in a clove of garlic, say,
or any plant, it's in the many, many thousands.
By the time you've put that plant, you've turned it into its oil,
its carb, and its protein isolate,
there's none of those molecules left.
So flavouring signals a lack of phyto-nutrients.
And UPF affects, this is my daughter Lyra,
and both my kids are absolutely, neither of them is engaged
with any of this content, by the way,
so I do want to say my kids eat quite a lot of ultra-processed food
because food binds us to the people around us,
it creates community,
and ideally we would eat real food
that connected us to our family and our community
in a way that had cultural and historic meaning
and would form society.
Food is the building block of society.
In the absence of that, I do think it's important
that they eat the same food as their friends,
that they're not weird in some way.
So my kids do some of this.
I'm happy to answer questions about how I feed my kids
or how I try and feed my kids.
My kids largely feed themselves.
It affects the microbiome.
So the particular molecules are
neuro-nutritive sweeteners, we think affect the microbiome,
and the emulsifiers.
So emulsifiers are present in everything from your fizzy drinks
to your ice cream, to the bread, to the ready meals,
to all the confectionary, they are everywhere.
Emulsifiers, as lots of you in this room
in the scientific training will know,
emulsifiers allow you to mix fat and water.
So egg yolk, when you make a mayonnaise,
it's emulsion made by the use of egg yolk.
You can use mustard as well.
Emulsion paint is a mix of fatty droplets,
suspended milk is an emulsion.
So emulsifiers occur throughout nature.
You can make an argument that almost every cell in your body
is a kind of emulsion.
You are an emulsion of aqueous cellular contents
with a fatty layer surrounding them.
So emulsions in themselves aren't harmful.
But when we study the synthetic emulsifiers,
the polysorbate 80, the carboxymethylcellulose,
they work in lots of different ways.
It seems like they have very significant effects
on the friendly bugs that live inside us.
The friendly bugs have much more agency
over the way our bodies work
than we previously thought.
So we recruit around a trillion bugs.
I might be out by an order of magnitude either way there,
but we've got about a trillion bugs.
They act as a kind of metabolic engine
and they help us eat food that we can't eat.
So when we eat fibre,
we all know that fibre is good for us.
You can't actually digest fibre.
Ffibre is fermented or eaten
by the friendly bugs inside you
and they turn it into lots of things,
particularly things called short-chain fatty acids
that are released into your bloodstream.
Some of them nourish your brain,
some of them are good for your heart.
Lots of them modulate your immune system.
But this microbiome,
you live in a delicate, negotiated balance with it.
If you keep it healthy, it will keep you healthy.
It keeps out invaders, it protects the lining of the gut
and it controls your immune system.
So mucking around with it seems to be a very bad idea
because we're only just discovering why.
As well as its effect on the human body,
ultra-processed food also affects the planet
and so we pay for it many times over.
The map there you see is of Brazil
and the green lines at the other river,
sorry, it's from South America,
at the other river that flows through the Amazon.
So there's a river that we know called the Amazon,
flows along the ground.
A much greater volume of water
flows through the airborne river
and it evaporates from trees
and I'm sure I don't have to explain to lots of you
that rain comes from trees.
Rain can't get very far from the sea.
It has to fall on a tree,
the tree breathes it out
and that's what carries rain inland.
So we've now cut down so much of the forest
to grow soy that there's no longer rain falling
and if the rain doesn't fall,
there isn't even a river you can divert.
We're going to see desertification.
We're already seeing water shortages
in the soy growing regions.
So ironically, the biggest threat
to, say, Brazilian agribusiness
is Brazilian agribusiness.
The food system that seems to be creating
all this food security for us
is actually creating enormous
instability and food insecurity.
Ultraprocess food and the system that produces it
is the second leading cause of emissions
and as I say, the leading cause of biodiversity.
We pay for it in the lawsuits.
You may remember when I was writing the book,
my brother Zand said to me,
wasn't there a lawsuit where someone sued Pringles
because there wasn't enough potato in it
to actually call it a crisp?
And I was like, oh, this is a cool story.
I'll write about this.
So I looked it up.
And in fact, he'd got it a bit wrong.
It was the manufacturers of Pringles,
Procter and Gamble, who got involved
in legal action with the Treasury.
They were the ones trying to say
there is not enough potato in a Pringle
to justify calling it a potato crisp.
And if it's a potato crisp, it's a vatable,
you pay 20% vat, and other cris,
so corn based chips for arcane reasons
that tax lawyers will explain,
corn based chips and other chips
you don't pay tax on.
So it was Pringles suing about their low potato content
and trying to claim that it was much more like
a sort of extruded cake.
This is the homepage of Coca-Cola.
This is the global website homepage
just a few weeks ago.
I think it was a few months ago.
And you'll see they're creating a world without waste.
And this kind of homepage is a feature
of many of the corporations that make our food.
I mean, there are about 15%
there are about 15 companies
that make almost all of our calories.
In fact, around 75% of our calories
come from just six primary producers.
They produce most of the world's grain and oil.
So this idea of the companies as cleaner uppers of plastic
and they almost look like NGOs dedicated to plastic cleanup
is really weird because if you then search
the world's biggest plastic polluter
it is in fact Coca-Cola.
So the plastic pollution caused by ultraprocess food is enormous.
But the biggest harm really is because ultraprocess food is addictive.
Now food addiction for a long time is very unfashionable.
It's problematic because inextricably tangled up
with the idea of addiction is the idea of abstinence.
You can't propose something be addictive
if you can't then propose a being abstinent from it.
So food addiction for a long time
was considered a behavioral addiction.
And yet the substance itself
and there will be people in this audience
who recognise this in themselves
the substances themselves do feel like the thing that drives the addiction.
And the definition is the use of a substance continues
despite knowledge of harms, despite repeated attempts to quit.
This is a picture of Lyra eating coca-pops.
Lyra can eat, she's now six
and she can eat five adult portions of coca-pops.
If you look at those traffic light labels on coca-pops
you'll see there are two oranges and two greens.
It's a relatively healthy food.
Now that's if a grown-up eats 30 grams.
If a six-year-old eats more than 120 grams
all those lights obviously turn red.
When she's eating it's kind of hilarious
but it's also as if she's eating in a trance.
So we have a huge amount of evidence
that for many people food is addictive
and I'm speaking to lots of senior research psychiatrists
about the links between ultraprocess food
and binge eating and other eating disorders.
This evidence is still very early.
It's really potentially traumatic
and sensitising to talk about so I say that with caution
but I would say if you recognise
that you have an addicted relationship with food
it will almost certainly be ultraprocessed products
and we are working very hard to try and work out
how that works and how to quit it.
But there's a lot of different evidence around it.
The reason it's addictive is because the purpose
of ultraprocessing is not just profit,
it's financialised growth.
So for the book I spoke to a huge number of different people
who work within the food system
and it's interesting people to speak to were the bankers
because the bankers understand how everything works
and they explained that what we think about
as a food supply system is actually an inverted money supply system.
It's a way of extracting money from us
and handing a little bit of it to the farmers
but most of it to the intermediary processing companies
and some of the food companies have made very sincere concerted efforts
to stop selling so many ultraprocessed products.
Danon have, so Emmanuel Faber at Danon,
tried to turn it into a social enterprise
to really realign the portfolio.
Similar efforts happened at Pepsi and at Unilever.
In every case, those senior executives were replaced.
Activist investors often voted them out
and the analyst at BlackRock explained this to me
these companies are not in control of their business model.
It's a very small number of institutional investors
owns an integer percentage of all of the companies
and so the purpose of these companies
is to provide financial growth for our pensions to some extent.
Certainly my pension, part of my pension is at BlackRock
so I'm very intimately part of the problem.
So a lot of my research now is trying to use
and I'm working with a number of economists now
to try and demonstrate that these companies are financialized,
that the food system is financialized,
that all of the incentives about the way we produce food
are financial and we can show that when
public health activist investors put public health proposals
to boards and to companies,
they're almost always voted down by hedge funds,
by pension funds and by financial institutional investors.
So the companies are trapped inside the incentives
and so that leads me to a thought of some solutions
but I'm really interested to discuss in more detail with you.
I put here the British Nutrition Foundation logo
so this is one of our leading charities
that produces information on food,
they advise the government,
they collaborate with policy makers
and in almost every article that I've been quoted in
over the last few months,
there is someone, a nutritionist, a scientist
from the British Nutrition Foundation
who also has an opinion on ultraprocessed food.
Their opinion is it's not usually a very useful way of thinking about food.
The reason those food company logos are there
is they're just some of the people who pay
the British Nutrition Foundation
which is majority funded by companies
that make ultraprocessed food.
The number one change we need is a cultural change
where we come to regard the companies that make our food
as being like tobacco companies.
Their money is dirty and if we accept their money
we become part of the marketing division of the companies
and so we need to disentangle all the charities
that influence policy from the companies
that make the food that is harming us.
We need to put ultraprocessed food
in our national nutrition guidance.
Many, many countries around the world are doing this
so I just came back from New York,
I was speaking at the Global Obesity Federation,
it's a UN World Health Organization aligned body
and there is no question in countries around the globe
that ultraprocessed food is, as I say,
the primary cause of diet related disease
and it needs to be regulated.
This is a pack of frosted flakes from Mexico.
The tiger is gone and you can see the black hexagons on the pack.
There are marketing restrictions
and the argument I make is not anti-capitalist,
it's not anti-growth, it's not neo-Marxist,
it's all compatible, it all makes sense
with really good economic policy.
We want to increase choice and freedoms.
We don't want to nanny anyone.
I wouldn't ban this food and I wouldn't tax most of it.
We could have some progressive taxes with caution
but in this country I wouldn't tax ultraprocess food
because it's the food that we depend on.
I put the warning labels on, I change institutional food.
It's really good economics to have food in hospitals,
prisons and schools being real food.
It's really important, we've got lots of evidence about that.
I'd like to see the rise of not-for-profit food companies.
There are pharmaceutical models of this.
You can build a competitive company,
you can build a company that pays back some investors in fact,
that competes with for-profit companies
but isn't hamstrung by a relationship with those investors.
There's an example of the kind of policies we need.
In Brazil, we see a US Coke can there,
very similar to a UK Coke can.
In Brazil, the label's on the back.
In Chile, the activists learn the lessons
and manage to get the label on the front
and in Argentina the label is bigger than the logo.
There's no justification however you think about food,
I fat, salt, sugar and there is value to that classification.
There is no justification for not having a warning label on Fizzy Pop
and there are some foods in Mexico.
All the cartoons gone and warning labels on it.
Thank you very much for listening
and I'm happy to take some questions now.
Thank you.
