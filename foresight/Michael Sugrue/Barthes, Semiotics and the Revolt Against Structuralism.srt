2
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,820
Rollin Bart is one of the most

3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,780
and influential of the contemporary French cultural critics.

4
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,580
He died in 1980, but before he had finished his final work,

5
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,340
he had broken decisively with the most important traditions

6
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,940
in post-World War II Western European thought.

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,560
Particularly, he made a decisive break

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,900
with structuralism and with Marxism.

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,940
And the result of his investigations,

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,260
which are organized around the theme of semiotics,

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,540
the theory of science, served to drive

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,660
the tendency of contemporary French culture

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,260
and perhaps to some degree the tendency of contemporary

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,540
high culture throughout the West towards post-structuralism

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,900
and post-modernism.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,500
So this is Bart's great achievement,

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,860
which is bound up with his critical activities.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,620
And we might be inclined to say that Bart

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,660
is, offers us one possible reading of Nietzsche.

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,460
In fact, Bart's reading of Nietzsche,

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,740
which emphasizes aesthetics, which emphasizes

22
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,620
a critical stance, which emphasizes

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,320
the outsider status of the critic,

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,840
actually transforms the critic into a creative artist.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,800
And in the process of expanding the domain of the critic,

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,080
in expanding the creativity of the critic,

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,840
creates a new sort of art form, or if not

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,520
a new sort of art form, a new approach to human creativity,

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,400
which allows for the questioning of all previously

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,640
established verities and allows for the undermining

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,760
and interrogation of what post-modernists

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,800
call foundational discourses.

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,760
Now, because Bart was a French intellectual who

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,200
was simultaneously Protestant, homosexual,

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
and without a terminal degree.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
He had become ill when he was supposed

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,480
to stand for his final examinations.

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,000
He was very much an outsider in the French Academy.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,560
He was everything that most French intellectuals are not.

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,320
And for that reason, I think that there

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,920
were personal issues which tended

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,440
to drive his demythologizing project, which made him more

43
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,240
sensitive to the hidden coercions,

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,600
to the hidden hypocrisies in the contemporary state

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,720
of French intellectual culture, but also particularly

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,520
French mass culture.

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,240
Bart is remarkable for his very sensitive and very

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,840
intelligent readings of mass culture

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,800
and the artifacts of mass culture.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,080
What he does is use semiotics, which I'll explain in a bit,

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,400
to try and decode the artifacts of mass culture

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,960
to discern what hidden messages are being generated

53
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,560
in these cultural artifacts and who

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,720
it is that's generating these messages for what purposes,

55
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
usually coercive, of course, because he at least

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,160
starts out in the Marxist tradition.

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,640
And ultimately, the point, or at least initially,

58
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,480
his point of demythologizing, of finding the hidden meanings

59
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,840
caught within the artifacts of mass culture

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,680
was to liberate us from the tyranny of mass-produced

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
consciousness.

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,560
So he wants to free us, to liberate us,

63
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
and perhaps individuate us.

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,600
He says in a piece called The Lover's Discourse,

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,840
which is a lovely book, very half-novelistic and half

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,520
essayist, it's quite a lovely piece.

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,480
He says that the reason why he wrote the book

68
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,320
is because The Lover's Discourse is a discourse

69
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,200
of profound loneliness.

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,440
And in fact, Bart is continuing a theme

71
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,960
that was developed in the middle part of the 20th century

72
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,680
in French culture, the idea of the lonely ego

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,040
existentially operating in a void of meaning,

74
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,280
in a void of coherence, deciding arbitrarily

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
how to arrange and fix the world in a way almost constructing

76
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,440
the world.

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,360
So Bart, like many French intellectuals,

78
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
is retreating into interiority, is

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,040
retreating away from the external world,

80
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,880
and trying to suggest that the external world is constructed

81
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,000
by us, not given to us.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
If you can see, this is some ways

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,200
a derivation from the Kantian project

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
of showing that we actively construct the external world.

85
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,680
But it's much more radical than Kant's project,

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,320
because what Bart is going to argue

87
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,760
is ultimately that we construct not just the world of signs,

88
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,440
the area of society, the domain of history,

89
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,520
also ultimately nature is a social and linguistic construct.

90
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,720
So in a way, you could see that he's

91
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,080
formulating a sort of Cartesian aesthetics in which

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,200
the lonely ego confronts a completely indeterminate world.

93
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,400
And the project is then interesting, creative,

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,680
pleasurable world making.

95
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,080
So what Bart is doing is liberating the critic,

96
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,680
liberating the ego, and liberating the self

97
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,000
from preconceived identities, and from arbitrary and spurious

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,480
limitations on human activity.

99
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,960
We might want to say that Bart created a poetic protest

100
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,040
against human limitations, and it's

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,960
in the form of a demythologizing myth.

102
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,600
We will find, ironically enough, at the end of his project

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,360
that Bart goes so far in the process of semiotic demythologizing

104
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,240
that not only does he conclude that he

105
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,000
is able to demythologize the various artifacts

106
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,280
of mass culture around him, but he becomes reflexive and ironic

107
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,520
and undertakes to inquire into structuralism and Marxism

108
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,520
and semiotics itself if it is not also

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
a myth with a hidden agenda.

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,280
And so what we end up with is the demythologizer

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,960
ends up demythologizing demythology.

112
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,080
And what you end up with then is a sort of metamith,

113
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,240
an ironic assertion that instead of unmasking reality

114
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,680
so that we can see the true face, the substantial reality

115
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,760
beneath, we are going to unmask reality

116
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,360
and find beneath that it's just another mask.

117
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,760
And then it turns out to be masks all the way down.

118
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,000
There's no face underneath it.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,160
There is no substantial reality.

120
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
So what Bart is doing is withdrawing into interiority

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,480
to a very carefully and thoroughly cultivated self.

122
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,160
And Bart is, I would say, the great philosophical exponent

123
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,280
of pleasure and the pleasure principle

124
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,400
in contemporary thought.

125
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,480
The sort of person that moves away

126
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,480
from the external world tries to render it dubious, contingent,

127
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,720
arbitrary, and depended upon construction by the self

128
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,800
is the sort of person that feels oppressed

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,120
by the external world and would like to remove

130
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,360
all those limitations.

131
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
I would be tempted to say that Bart's word in some respects

132
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,000
represents the triumph of the pleasure principle

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,880
over the reality principle.

134
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,600
He withdraws into his mind the way the Epicurean does

135
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,000
into withdraw into his pleasure garden.

136
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,920
And that's the reason why one of his finest and latest works

137
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,120
is called The Pleasures of the Text.

138
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,120
What he has done by liberating us from authority

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,760
and from the author and from any preconceived, predetermined

140
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,760
meaning within a text is to say that we, as critics,

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,440
as careful readers of the text, have completely free play.

142
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,400
Our domain is one of complete power and complete control.

143
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,760
By withdrawing any meaning, by killing off the author

144
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,240
and saying all we have is the text,

145
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,400
it makes the critic like a creative artist.

146
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Now, the best book to start out with,

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,120
and if you're going to read Bart, and I personally

148
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,720
have really enjoyed reading Bart because he's such a wit.

149
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,320
He has a very morbid, sarcastic wit,

150
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,960
and he's somewhat like Oscar Wilde in the sense

151
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,240
that it's a kind of exercise in sarcasm

152
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,040
which is very, very arch and carefully drawn.

153
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,760
The strong point of French culture, or high culture,

154
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,480
has always been its powerful connection

155
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,520
between philosophy and poetry.

156
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Well, their philosophical thinkers, for the most part,

157
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,880
are closely allied to poetic expression, poetic considerations,

158
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,240
aesthetic considerations.

159
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,360
And Bart, I think, is one of the extreme examples

160
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,680
of that tendency.

161
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,840
In a book called Mythologies, which he wrote in 57,

162
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,400
what we have here is a combination,

163
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,320
a rather ironic combination, of Marxist culture critique,

164
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,600
something like that which we found in, say, the Frankfurt

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,800
School, unmasking the media of mass communications,

166
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,960
things like advertising, showing that they

167
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,680
are a way of exercising social control performed

168
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,080
in the interest of a certain small elite within society.

169
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,800
Well, Bart is doing something like that in his mythologies.

170
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,200
It's a collection of short essays in which he examines

171
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,680
various artifacts from French culture in the 1950s

172
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,720
and demythologizes them.

173
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
He says, this is what it appears to mean,

174
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,280
this is what it appears to signify,

175
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,000
and yet there is another hidden second level of meaning

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,240
that goes beyond that.

177
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,840
And that's what he's searching for.

178
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,280
He calls this second level of meaning myth.

179
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,640
Now, at the end of it, at least in the English-American

180
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,760
edition, is an essay that Bart wrote 14 years

181
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,560
after he wrote his book Mythologies,

182
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
and that's called Myth Today.

183
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,640
And that's where he begins this project

184
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,760
of ironic reconsideration of the demythologizing project,

185
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,240
where he says, you know what, it may have been that I was

186
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,160
unable to pull off what I was trying to pull off,

187
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,840
because it may be masks all the way down.

188
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,720
If there is no substantial reality behind appearance,

189
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,000
then the possibility of demythologizing the world

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,280
completely disappears.

191
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,320
It's just one myth after another.

192
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
Let me give some examples of his activity,

193
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,960
and this may make it a little bit more sensible.

194
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,640
What he does is semiotics.

195
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,920
And semiotics can be defined as the science of science

196
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,600
or the theory of science, the general science of science

197
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,160
is what Desa-sur calls it.

198
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,920
It's a subset of structural linguistics,

199
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,920
which was founded and organized by Desa-sur

200
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,480
around the turn of the century.

201
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,760
And semiotics views the human domain

202
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,000
as the domain of symbols, as the domain of signs.

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,640
And what it does is try and read these symbols,

204
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,200
read these signs, and look for their internal coherence.

205
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,560
Semiotics is concerned primarily with the internal coherence

206
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
of relations between signs.

207
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,640
The relation between signs in the world is not memetic,

208
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,680
in the sense that it doesn't represent the world.

209
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,520
Rather, the relationship between signs is semiotic.

210
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,840
In other words, internal coherence of the system of symbols

211
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,960
is what we're talking about, not the correspondence

212
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,520
between the content of the symbols and the world.

213
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,040
It corresponds to a shift in the conception of truth.

214
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,480
Semiotics holds to the idea of a coherence conception

215
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,080
of truth.

216
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,880
If the symbol set is coherent, it's very much similar

217
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,200
to what Rory believes.

218
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,920
If the symbol set is coherent, well,

219
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,720
then there's nothing to judge it by.

220
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,560
We can judge it by whether it reflects the world,

221
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,200
because it is assumed at the outset

222
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,840
that systems of symbols do not mimic the world,

223
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,320
that Mises is impossible.

224
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,240
Rather, their truth is to be found

225
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,360
in the internal coherence of the systems.

226
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,040
Think about something like non-Euclidean geometry.

227
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,560
We look around for an application of it,

228
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,360
and there aren't very many.

229
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,680
Perhaps there are none.

230
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,640
Well, that may mean that non-Euclidean geometry fails

231
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,400
if our standard is correspondence to the world.

232
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,600
But if our understanding of truth is coherence,

233
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
well, then it's perfectly satisfactory.

234
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
It's just as true as something like Euclidean geometry.

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,120
Well, Bard is adopting a set of assumptions roughly like that.

236
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,240
Now, let me give some examples of this,

237
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
make it a little more sensible.

238
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,480
Examples of semiotic systems are something

239
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,320
like psychoanalysis or Marxism, linguistic systems,

240
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,680
that are separate and incommensurable.

241
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,600
And in addition, things like clothing, the kind of clothes

242
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
you wear, that's a semiotic system.

243
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,400
Mass culture, things like advertising or MTV,

244
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,480
an extremely powerful semiotic system.

245
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,400
Let me give you some examples of how something like this

246
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,600
would work.

247
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,120
And you'll realize that you have been doing

248
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,360
semiotic analysis all your life.

249
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,480
A sailor gets off a ship, comes into port,

250
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,880
two women come up and say, hi sailor.

251
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,000
One of them is wearing a long black dress

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,640
and has a crucifix around her neck, and she's a nun.

253
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
And she says to the sailor, hello sailor, hi.

254
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,120
And what she's doing is saying hello to the sailor.

255
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,560
Another woman comes out, she's dressed in red satin hot pants

256
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,600
and a see-through blouse says, hi sailor.

257
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,760
Now clearly, that person is a prostitute, not a nun.

258
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,280
And clearly, hi sailor means something very different

259
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,080
in that semiotic system.

260
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,480
The point being that the way she is dressed

261
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,920
is a text that the sailor is reading, which

262
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,000
is what he knows how not to proposition the nun.

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,920
Doesn't that make sense?

264
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,600
And we're doing it all the time.

265
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,040
Bart wrote a wonderful book called The System of Fashion,

266
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
in which he analyzes ladies' fashion.

267
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,360
And he treats it as a semiotic system.

268
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,240
And he's right, it is a system of science.

269
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,800
It's a remarkable idea.

270
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,680
So one of the utilities of this is

271
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,560
that it can be applied to the entire human domain.

272
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,400
All kinds of communicative activity, or every kind of sign,

273
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,720
can be broken down and analyzed.

274
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,320
We can find its first order meeting,

275
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,080
and then perhaps we can also find a second order meaning.

276
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,000
And that second order meaning, the myth that underlies it,

277
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,680
that hidden meaning, that's Bart's project.

278
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,400
It's a very interesting set of thoughts.

279
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,000
All right, now let me give you some examples of this

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,640
and make it a little more sensible.

281
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,280
Bart has a wonderful sense of humor,

282
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,560
and he seems to be attracted to kind of the bizarre and odd

283
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,320
in the world.

284
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,600
He finds things that approach the world

285
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,160
obliquely and ironically.

286
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,360
And it's strange that a highly cultivated, extremely

287
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,240
sensitive French intellectual should write

288
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,120
an essay on professional wrestling, on detergent,

289
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,800
on striptease, on the brain of Einstein.

290
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
Remember that Einstein's brain was taken out and put in a jar

291
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,960
and saved?

292
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,200
There's an essay on that as a cultural icon.

293
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,560
In other words, he asks, what does that mean?

294
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,720
Plastic, he reads it.

295
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
What does plastic mean?

296
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,120
What's the myth hidden in it?

297
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,560
You wouldn't have thought perhaps there was any myth

298
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,400
hidden in it.

299
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,080
In fact, this is Bart's project to go from surface structure

300
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,480
to deep structure.

301
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,400
After he reconsiders it, 10, 15 years later perhaps,

302
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,280
he realizes there's only surface structure,

303
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,440
and just move from one surface to another.

304
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,080
Let me give you some examples of what he tells us

305
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,480
about wrestling that's worthwhile,

306
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,080
and why I think this guy is really deep.

307
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,160
If not always deep and not always accurate,

308
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
always entertaining and very sharp.

309
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,160
He says, wrestling is something that's laughed at

310
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,560
by intellectuals, all us professional smart guys,

311
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,320
the PhDs, we look down upon professional wrestling

312
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,080
and the people that go, and it really doesn't amount

313
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,200
to very much, because it's kind of, well, childish,

314
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,520
it's silly, it's pseudo sport.

315
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,920
In fact, Bart has another reading,

316
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,240
and it's a much deeper reading, he says.

317
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,960
The reason why working class people go to wrestling

318
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,720
is because it's a spectacle, not a sport,

319
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,160
they're not stupid, they know full well

320
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,600
this is entirely rigged, entirely fixed.

321
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,320
So the question arises for Bart,

322
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
which wouldn't perhaps arise in the mind

323
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
of most intellectuals, what the hell

324
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,080
do they get out of this, what's the point of it?

325
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,040
Why go to see this spectacle?

326
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,520
Well, Bart has a real interesting way of looking at it.

327
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,560
He says, this idea of a community spectacle,

328
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,360
where we already know the outcome,

329
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,480
and what we're cheering really is symbols,

330
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,120
or the personified symbols of various kinds of

331
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
cultural trends, for example Hulk Hogan,

332
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,520
or someone like that comes out dressed

333
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,920
as an American hero wearing the flag,

334
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,360
we're all rooting for America,

335
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,720
and he's the personification of that,

336
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,600
which is why we know in advance that he's gotta win.

337
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,400
Well, here's what Bart says about wrestling,

338
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,760
he says, not only is this not what it appears to be,

339
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,420
but in fact, if you look back,

340
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,560
you will find in the spectacle of wrestling

341
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,200
the origin of attic drama.

342
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,120
When tragedy started out, it was not high art,

343
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,400
it was popular art, and everybody knew exactly

344
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,200
what was going on, and the end was foretold,

345
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,040
everybody knew it.

346
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,360
And what was going on in Oedipus?

347
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,040
The same thing is going on with Hulk Hogan in a way.

348
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
Oedipus is a symbol, not a person,

349
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,800
and we all know the outcome of the story,

350
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,120
we all know how this has to end,

351
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,800
we're just cheering on because it creates

352
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,200
a sense of social solidarity among us,

353
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,600
you know, he represents us.

354
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,680
So like, it's a real put down or come down,

355
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,800
because it's characteristic of contemporary intellectuals

356
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,160
to think of something like tragedy

357
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,720
as the highest of high art.

358
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,200
What is a greater achievement of attic culture

359
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,760
than Oedipus?

360
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,280
Well, Bart thinks that Oedipus at least started out

361
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,240
and that we've transformed it,

362
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,080
but at least the way it started out

363
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,400
was something like Hulk Hogan.

364
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,520
It was all the people, the average man in the street

365
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,640
or man in the Agora would go in there and cheer away,

366
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,240
no one for well that Oedipus has to get it in the end.

367
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,400
And the point is that it's a spectacle, not a sport,

368
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,240
it is a tale which is foregone,

369
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,180
and it is a system of signs.

370
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,160
She's a very interesting thought,

371
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,760
you didn't think you could read professional wrestling,

372
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,280
in fact, it's a text, very interesting thought.

373
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,040
All right, let me take it a little further.

374
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,600
Detergent, this is a very interesting thing.

375
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,920
And it's very funny because somehow I can't imagine

376
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,000
Bart covering something like,

377
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,960
he was doing something rather journalistic,

378
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,240
the World Congress of Detergents in 1954.

379
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,800
So apparently all the detergent manufacturers

380
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,680
got together in France, in Paris,

381
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,040
which it seems like an unlikely place

382
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,240
to hold a detergent convention.

383
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,000
And they had all kinds of advertisements

384
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,920
for the various kinds of detergents.

385
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
And what he did was he actually looked at the advertisements

386
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,040
as a text and read them.

387
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,960
And he said, what is this telling us?

388
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,360
Well, for example, when we find out that Luxe

389
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,680
deep cleans linen, what does that tell us?

390
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,800
Well, first of all, it tells you that linen is deep.

391
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,120
Who would have thought that?

392
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,880
What does it mean for linen to be deep?

393
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,600
Mm, very odd stuff.

394
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,320
And he elaborates the carefully constructed distinctions

395
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,200
that are being created

396
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
between roughly equivalent identical products.

397
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
One is green, the other is blue.

398
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,280
Chemically, they may be completely identical.

399
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,680
We've changed the food coloring,

400
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,760
completely different advertising campaign

401
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,600
connected to them.

402
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,040
One is appealing to the man of the house,

403
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,680
because it shows a guy lumberjacking

404
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,440
and then washing his hands with the blue stuff.

405
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,920
Blue is masculine.

406
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,800
If you've got pink stuff and a woman is doing dishes,

407
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,880
pink is feminine.

408
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,800
Chemically, it may be completely identical.

409
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,720
But what we are doing here is constructing

410
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,160
a contemporary myth.

411
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,520
And what Bard is saying is that myth has become a commodity

412
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,760
and commodities have become myths.

413
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,840
In a way, it's a change in the old Marxist formula,

414
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,080
CMC, from capital, volume one.

415
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,480
Commodity, money, commodity.

416
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,160
What Bard is saying that we have is consumer goods

417
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,200
and then mythology and then more consumer goods.

418
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
And the consumer goods serve the purpose

419
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,000
in this culture that used to be served

420
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,040
by the transcendence of religious objects.

421
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,320
In other words, we fetishize consumer goods,

422
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,040
which is why we bow down and worship

423
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,560
this year's new Cadillac.

424
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,000
And there's a drumroll before we bring it out.

425
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
Why? Because it is a new kind of icon

426
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,360
of contemporary life, of ease, of luxury.

427
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,760
I mean, imagine a Cadillac commercial.

428
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,800
What you see is Cadillac style, right?

429
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,680
What this means is Cadillac style.

430
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,200
What is the myth implicit there?

431
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,560
Rich people, happy people, people who have good lives

432
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,000
have Cadillacs.

433
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,440
To have a Cadillac is to have a good life.

434
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,120
Cadillac means good life, right?

435
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,840
There are myths being constructed

436
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,400
and our new mythologizers are not Homer,

437
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,520
are not Shakespeare, they are Admin.

438
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,640
It's a real deep and caustic argument.

439
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,600
Now, he investigates striptease and he finds out,

440
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,440
or he comes, he draws the inference

441
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,480
that the process of striptease desexualizes women.

442
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,720
Why? Because it never goes the entire way.

443
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,960
It never turns into sex.

444
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,000
It's an elaborate ritual in which we get

445
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,040
a sort of catharsis for men's sex drives,

446
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,520
who are the vast majority of the people

447
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,920
who make up the audience.

448
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,920
And it is a sort of ritual, it is entirely stereotyped.

449
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,800
You could almost construct a formula for it.

450
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,720
And what he says is this is just the construction

451
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,200
of the myth of woman and in particular,

452
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,200
the idea that sexuality is incomplete

453
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
in this sort of ritual.

454
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
He moves to the brain of Einstein,

455
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,720
which is a wonderful little essay.

456
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,560
And what he says is what the myth underlying that is,

457
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,040
that knowledge is a formula.

458
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,600
We have knowledge in a box here.

459
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,800
Einstein's brain, somehow inside that,

460
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,640
knowledge is enclosed within space.

461
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,880
See, we have Einstein's brain.

462
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,520
Someday we're gonna know exactly what makes this knowledge

463
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,920
and exactly what makes us such a great brain,

464
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,120
but for now, we're just keeping it in a box.

465
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,360
Knowledge is in a box.

466
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,200
It's the opposite of a postmodern icon,

467
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,240
Einstein's brain, destroy the brain and break the box.

468
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,360
That's postmodernism.

469
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,440
All right.

470
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,040
And finally, plastic.

471
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,840
Who would have thought you could read plastic?

472
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,380
What a perverse idea.

473
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,580
Well, Bart reads plastic and what he finds underneath

474
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,420
the plastic image is the myth of infinite transformation.

475
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,220
You can turn plastic into anything.

476
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,060
You can change its color.

477
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,140
You can change its shape.

478
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,740
You can make it do all kinds of stuff.

479
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,420
Plastic is the ultimate postmodern substance.

480
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,740
Plastic is infinite freedom, infinite transformation.

481
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,340
Plastic in both its adjectival and noun senses.

482
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,180
Okay.

483
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,300
Now let's think about myth,

484
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,580
and particularly that essay on myth today.

485
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,100
What happens in myth and the reason why myth is misleading

486
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,140
is because myth dissolves the realm of history

487
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,420
by making it appear as nature.

488
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,940
It makes the world appear natural and given.

489
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,700
It disguises the message that is being proposed.

490
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,780
And the most important of Bart's examples of this,

491
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,940
which has been discussed, ad infinitum, ad nauseam,

492
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,900
and the criticism of Bart,

493
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,100
is the picture of the Negro soldier.

494
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,940
Here's the idea.

495
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,980
He's looking at some French magazine,

496
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,060
and what he sees in the mid 50s is the picture

497
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,900
of a Negro soldier saluting the French tricolor.

498
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,540
And apparently he's dressed in a military uniform.

499
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,700
And the idea is that on the first level,

500
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,020
on the first level of a relation between the sign

501
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,580
and the thing signified, let's examine that photograph.

502
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,780
Level one, we have a sign, which is this piece of paper,

503
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,000
which has a film of light and dark spots on it.

504
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,500
That's what a photograph is, in a literal strict sense.

505
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,620
Okay.

506
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,340
What that sign signifies is a picture,

507
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,620
is the saluting Negro soldier.

508
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,740
That's level one.

509
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,300
That's the obvious surface level

510
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,700
of what that photograph means.

511
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,980
But Bart says, you know what that photograph really means?

512
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,900
At level two, in which we transform,

513
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,820
think of it this way.

514
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,640
Think of the photograph relating to the idea

515
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,300
or the image of the Negro soldier

516
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,740
as a sign relating to a thing signified.

517
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,700
So far so good, because semiotics investigate signs

518
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,980
and the relationships to what they signify.

519
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,940
Now, let's take that image of the Negro soldier

520
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,340
and put it back in the first place

521
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,740
and turn that into a sign itself,

522
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,400
and then have that signify some second order thing.

523
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,940
So we're bootstrapping ourselves up

524
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,220
into a new level of meaning.

525
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,860
And what Bart says is obvious about this photo

526
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,060
is that it's an apology for French colonialism.

527
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,220
He's saying, despite the fact

528
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,500
that the French colonial empire is breaking down,

529
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,140
despite the fact that we have considerable move

530
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,860
against colonialism and that there's a considerable racist

531
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,060
element and imperialist element in French political life,

532
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,460
in fact, there's no problem at all.

533
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,420
What us worry?

534
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,260
Look, look at the happy, content, loyal, docile Negro soldier.

535
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,820
That's why he's saluting the tricolor there,

536
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,620
and that's what that message is really all about.

537
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,020
And he says, that's really exact,

538
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,820
in other words, he thinks all the artifacts

539
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,940
of modern culture are like that,

540
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,100
and we are all under influence

541
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,140
by a sort of disguised coercion.

542
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,180
It's a deep argument.

543
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,420
Let me make a different analogy

544
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,380
and make it a little more sensible

545
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,020
and bring it home in contemporary America.

546
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,860
Rambo.

547
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,740
What is Rambo?

548
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,740
Well, on one level, it's a series of dots on a movie screen.

549
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,020
And what it shows is Sylvester Stallone killing 500 people,

550
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,100
being the toughest guy around and being invincible.

551
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,580
He's something like the modern Achilles.

552
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,820
Now, that's the first level.

553
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,660
That's the obvious surface meaning.

554
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,700
What's the second level, the mythological meaning?

555
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,420
The mythological meaning is that America

556
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,540
didn't lose the Vietnam War.

557
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
We won the Vietnam War.

558
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,700
It was a strategic retreat,

559
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,660
and we're still strategically retreating from it

560
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,140
by constructing works of art,

561
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,900
which say it wasn't really a problem.

562
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,580
One American could kill 500 of anybody.

563
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,660
We're the toughest people in the world.

564
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,500
We never die.

565
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,340
We never bleed.

566
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,180
We never worry.

567
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,500
We always get the job done.

568
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,660
In other words, the myth of American invincibility

569
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,460
is built into the Rambo movies.

570
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,260
I mean, it's impossible to miss.

571
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,140
It obviously has ideological mythic content to it.

572
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,380
Now, there may turn out to be,

573
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,660
as I'm pretty sure there will turn out to be,

574
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,300
a plurality, perhaps an infinite plurality,

575
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,100
of possible mythic readings.

576
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,500
Remember, once the text becomes completely open,

577
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,700
that means you can do whatever you want with it,

578
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,500
and you can treat it and read it as being whatever you like

579
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,260
because there is no authority behind it.

580
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,340
So Bart, in some ways, gives with one hand

581
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,420
and takes away with the other, right?

582
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,180
Offers us one reading, but then points out

583
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,340
that this reading is not closed,

584
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,380
that there are an infinite number of other possible readings.

585
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,860
We might be tempted to say that

586
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,100
semiotics is what I would call an open system,

587
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,460
rather than a closed system.

588
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,340
In that respect, it's like

589
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,340
vikingshtini and language games, right?

590
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,260
And that means that there are an infinite number

591
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,340
of overlapping games that don't necessarily

592
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,660
conflict with each other.

593
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,420
Consider the proposition, for example,

594
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,660
that we do a Marxist analysis

595
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,300
of the American Civil War, and we find out

596
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,020
that Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves

597
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,740
because of his feelings about authority

598
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,860
towards his father or something,

599
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,540
or we do a Freudian analysis.

600
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,260
We also might want to do a Marxist analysis,

601
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,820
saying that the reason Lincoln freed the slaves

602
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,500
is because he was the agent of advanced capitalism.

603
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500
The point that is made by Bart is that

604
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,260
semiotics tells us that these systems

605
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,980
are not mutually exclusive, that what you're doing

606
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,620
is just describing the same thing

607
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,540
under the aegis of two different semiotic systems.

608
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,540
In other words, psychoanalysis does not refute

609
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,300
the Marxist interpretation of history.

610
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,220
The Marxist interpretation does not refute psychoanalysis.

611
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,860
They are two incommensurate

612
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,580
and mutually exclusive semiotic systems.

613
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,940
And there is an infinite possible proliferation

614
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,300
of semiotic systems, so we get an infinitude

615
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,460
of criticism and an infinitude of interpretation, right?

616
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,940
In some ways, you might say that Bart's project

617
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,180
is the inverse of that of Godomer.

618
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,180
Godomer says we should strive for clarity of interpretation,

619
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,460
strive to appropriate and renew our connection

620
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,380
to a cultural tradition, because it's a necessity for us,

621
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,060
but also what we should strive for

622
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,100
is the clarity of our interpretation,

623
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,900
transparency of interpretation.

624
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,380
Bart goes exactly the opposite way.

625
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,740
He says there is no clarity of interpretation.

626
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,340
That's one of the most dangerous myths of all.

627
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,340
In fact, once you think that you have clarified

628
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,700
to the one final and only interpretation,

629
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,380
that is the most ideological kind of self-delusion,

630
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,700
self-deception.

631
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,620
So what he's done then with the semiotic breakthrough

632
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,940
is undermine the presuppositions of Marxist

633
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,020
and structuralist culture critique.

634
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,380
Remember that structuralism thinks

635
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,060
that it's discerning the ultimate algebra

636
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,060
inside whatever it investigates.

637
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,180
And Marxism believes that it is truly

638
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,100
unmasking bourgeois ideology to get to the reality

639
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,740
of class conflict and exploitation.

640
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,100
Bart's point is that none of these activities are real,

641
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,060
they're just substituting one myth for another.

642
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,300
You can't get beyond it.

643
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,780
All right, now, let's look at the way he handles myth

644
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,380
and what he does with semiotics

645
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,980
in this final essay, Myth Today.

646
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,980
He calls myth the theft of language

647
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,260
because it depoliticizes language.

648
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,460
You don't see, or at least initially on first observation,

649
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,100
one does not notice that Rambo is an apology

650
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,700
for American interventionism.

651
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,060
It's an apology for American foreign policy,

652
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,460
which has been for the most part a failure,

653
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,420
at least with regard to Vietnam.

654
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,820
Well, his point is that what we want to move to

655
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,220
is politicized speech, where it is obvious

656
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,100
that there is some agenda behind that sort of a construction.

657
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,060
And once we repoliticize it, earlier in this career,

658
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,460
he thought that we could get to the real substantial truth.

659
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,260
Later on, what it turns out is that this mythic

660
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,500
demythologizing is, in fact,

661
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,140
the construction of a left-wing myth.

662
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,460
In fact, the demythologizer turns out

663
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,420
to be the remythologizer.

664
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,940
And that means that the critic is, in fact, the poet.

665
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,300
He's a creative artist.

666
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,260
And the critic relates to the work of art,

667
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,380
the way the artist relates to nature,

668
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,700
in the sense that, think about Plato's example

669
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,020
from the Fidris, Plato's example from the public,

670
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,820
where he says, an artist looks at a bed

671
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,860
and draws a picture of it.

672
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,180
And then a poet will look at that

673
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,500
and take it a little bit further.

674
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,780
We have three levels of reality.

675
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,260
We have the ultimate bed in the sky,

676
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,980
form of the bed, we have the bed down here,

677
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,260
and then we have the artistic reconstruction of it.

678
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,060
Well, Bart wants to add a new level to that.

679
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,420
We have the critical reconstruction of the artist's text.

680
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,540
It can be a painting, it can be a literary work,

681
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,820
it could be anything, but he is just as free

682
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,980
in how he interprets it.

683
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,860
So now we have a new domain for the artist to work in.

684
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,340
Previously, artists had been describing

685
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,700
the physical world, the social world.

686
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,620
Well, now it is possible for a new sort of critical art

687
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,980
to choose as its domain the world

688
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,900
of artistic creation itself.

689
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,620
It's a sort of, the criticism then becomes a meta art.

690
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,060
And then we get the completely free play of the text.

691
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,540
Now, here's the idea behind this.

692
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,860
What he is looking to do is undermine

693
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,060
the authority of the author.

694
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,900
He describes this as the death of the author.

695
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,220
The author has been abolished.

696
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,540
And the reason why he wants to abolish the author

697
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,380
and abolish authority is because that's what gives

698
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,500
the critic completely free play

699
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,460
within the domain of the text.

700
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,260
If, for example, a critic offers a reading

701
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,020
of a poem or a play and the author happens to be around

702
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,540
and he says to the critic, well, that's not what I meant.

703
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,020
Bart and that sort of critic,

704
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,740
this sort of post-structuralist critic,

705
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,380
this semiotic critic will say, so what?

706
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,780
The text is completely free.

707
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,340
What you think it means has nothing to do

708
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,540
with what it means as far as I'm concerned.

709
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,620
And there's no way you can legislate this for me.

710
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,300
The mere historical contingent fact

711
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,060
that you didn't mean that is just not my problem.

712
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,900
I got the text and that's all that matters.

713
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,780
So we eliminate intentionality and authority from the text.

714
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,980
We impose whatever we want on it.

715
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,860
You might want to say that what he's done is liberate

716
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,580
the connection between the signifier

717
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,260
and the thing signified.

718
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,620
He says you could have it signify whatever you want.

719
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,780
You take a text, you take a sign,

720
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,980
and whatever signification you want to attach to it,

721
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,580
that's perfectly satisfactory.

722
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,260
Do not be constrained by any externalities.

723
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,460
Retreat back into your own aesthetic judgment,

724
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,740
to your own aesthetic experience,

725
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,740
and the world is completely yours.

726
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,140
It's completely the domain of pleasure and your own freedom.

727
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,740
Now, what Bart says is something like this,

728
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,580
or the conclusion he ultimately comes to,

729
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,260
is that every limitation on human freedom

730
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,500
is ultimately a myth.

731
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,660
And in fact, clarity, which apparently

732
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,060
makes memesis possible, is one of the most dangerous myths,

733
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,060
because in fact, signs, discourse, communication

734
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,740
is neither clear nor obscure.

735
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,780
Do not create a myth of obscurity either.

736
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,580
That's not going to work, right?

737
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,220
So he doesn't want to go either way.

738
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,940
He says you can't generalize about it.

739
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,860
He doesn't have any satisfactory resolution.

740
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,060
He's caught between a rock and a hard place.

741
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,380
Towards the end of his essay on myth today,

742
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,540
he goes to great length to try and convince us

743
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,260
that right wing politics is more essentially

744
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,580
and closely caught up with myths than left wing politics.

745
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,220
But of course, it's so evidently done in bad faith.

746
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,180
He's so evidently trying to soft pedal

747
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,460
the mythic element of left wing politics

748
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,060
that when you step back and look at it,

749
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,660
what's clearly going on here is the ironic,

750
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,620
critical construction of a new meta myth,

751
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,020
which supports the projects he happens to like.

752
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,780
He has decided to read the domain of mythology

753
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,500
as if it particularly pertained to people

754
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,460
and tendencies that he disapproves of.

755
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,780
Of course, when you go back and read between the lines,

756
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,780
what he is is trashing the entire proposition

757
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,020
that we can demythologize the world.

758
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,740
There is no substantial reality.

759
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,860
He's retreated back into subjectivity.

760
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,420
Can you see why I call this a sort of Cartesian aesthetics?

761
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,660
It's me, me, me.

762
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,100
But instead of trying to find out,

763
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,020
say, the mathematical structure of the world,

764
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,500
he's trying to find out how can I maximize

765
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,420
my feelings of pleasure with regard to the text?

766
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,100
He says this in so many words,

767
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,540
or he comes pretty close to saying it in so many words,

768
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,620
the second to last page of mythology's myth today.

769
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,940
He says, even here in these mythologies,

770
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,380
I have used trickery, finding it painful,

771
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,260
constantly to work on the evaporation of reality.

772
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,220
I have started to make it excessively dense

773
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,860
and to discover in it a surprising compactness

774
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,020
which I savored with delight.

775
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,180
So the justification for this critical activity

776
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,220
is not the fact that it truly represents the world

777
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,220
because you can't truly represent the world.

778
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,660
The justification for it is that

779
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,860
he really savors it with delight.

780
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,340
In other words, this is the triumph

781
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,980
of the pleasure principle over the reality principle.

782
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,100
We can choose two ways to go in this domain

783
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,620
of post-modern, post-structuralist weightlessness.

784
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,660
We can move towards the will to power,

785
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,700
or we can move towards the will to pleasure.

786
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,820
Foucault chooses the first road.

787
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,300
He moves towards the will to power

788
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,100
and towards political activity.

789
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,220
Bart moves away from political power towards pleasure

790
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,740
and in moving towards pleasure,

791
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,060
he withdraws into a sort of aesthetic quietism

792
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,420
in which you could have political activity

793
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,060
as a sort of hobby, but you can't quite take it

794
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,540
with the grim and determined seriousness that Bart does.

795
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,620
He's involved too much in absorbing

796
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,100
the pleasures of the text.

797
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,380
He's become an intellectual aesthetic, all right?

798
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,260
And pleasure is the only justification

799
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,780
for any intellectual activity

800
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,060
because it can't mimic the world.

801
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,700
So all of human life is potentially

802
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,380
the domain of freedom, creativity, which is to say art.

803
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,460
And the transformation of life into art

804
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,700
is one of the most powerful

805
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,420
and worthwhile readings of Nietzsche.

806
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,260
You can see how this is all homage to Nietzsche in a way.

807
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,420
And the idea that there's no distinction

808
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,020
between appearance and reality,

809
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,020
that ultimately all we have is an infinite series of masks

810
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,660
and an infinite series of illusions,

811
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,060
what could be more Nietzschean and perspectival?

812
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,420
What could be more ironic,

813
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,620
and at the same time, gratify one's will to power?

814
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,740
Particularly if the will to power has been transformed

815
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,620
into me, me, me, simple internality,

816
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,820
the will to power becomes the will to pleasure.

817
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,540
It's worth comparing Bart's work

818
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,780
to the work of some of the other structuralists

819
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,260
or Marxists to see the uniqueness of his sort of position,

820
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,900
and also to see how, in some respects,

821
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,900
it all simultaneously expresses a general collective tendency

822
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,180
in particularly French intellectual high culture.

823
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,220
One of his contemporaries, Altausser,

824
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,740
tried to unify Marxism and structuralism.

825
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,140
And that, in some ways, is the last

826
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,620
of the modernist paradigms.

827
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,460
We get these giant deterministic systems,

828
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,380
and then try and show that they both operate simultaneously

829
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,180
and are both part of some larger meta-system.

830
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,860
Well, Bart knew Altausser and his reaction to this

831
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,180
was saying, look, this is the worst thing

832
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,420
you can possibly do.

833
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,580
The reason we are giving up structuralism,

834
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,380
the reason we are giving up Marxism,

835
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,740
is because these large deterministic systems,

836
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,580
first of all, inhibit, and as a matter of fact,

837
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,340
prohibit human freedom, right?

838
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,620
Freedom turns out to be an illusion.

839
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,780
You get these giant deterministic systems,

840
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,820
and in addition to that, they all entail

841
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,460
totalizing discourses, huge meta-narratives,

842
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,940
big picture stories which no one believes in anymore.

843
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,140
No one takes seriously, or at least Bart says,

844
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,780
that the people who are on the cutting edge

845
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,980
of high culture at the time that he is writing

846
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,140
can no longer take seriously the idea

847
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,500
that everything has a secret algebra hidden inside it,

848
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,020
and it's the job of structuralists

849
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,460
to find the secret algebra hidden in mathematics,

850
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,500
hidden in crystals, hidden in biological life forms,

851
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,700
hidden in literary constructs,

852
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,860
and also hidden in anthropology.

853
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,740
He says, no, there's no secret algebra

854
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,660
hidden in everything.

855
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,500
That's a myth that you people made up

856
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,780
so that you could legitimize structuralist discourse.

857
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,780
He says, the party's over for that.

858
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,540
We got so good at being critical.

859
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,940
We got so good at being negative and negating.

860
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,400
We negated the sort of structures

861
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,860
which made this criticism and negation possible.

862
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,260
In some respects, I think it was one of the artists

863
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,060
involved in the data movement who constructed a machine

864
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,380
that the first time you plugged it in, it destroyed itself.

865
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,380
Well, that is very much this conception of culture.

866
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,740
You plug the machine in, it criticizes everything around it,

867
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,140
and then when it gets kind of antsy,

868
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,820
it starts to criticize itself in that process of destruction

869
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,260
that Nietzschean philosophizing with a hammer

870
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,660
becomes a sort of intellectual vandalism.

871
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,300
And nothing is left except the ego,

872
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,660
but there isn't even a complete self

873
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,500
because when we break down the structures of communication,

874
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,900
the structures of knowledge,

875
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,540
and the structures of linguistic interaction

876
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,340
which give us some real hold to the external world,

877
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,180
it ultimately means that we're moving in the direction of solipsism.

878
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,660
Remember why I call this Cartesian aesthetics?

879
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,580
And that means that it's just me and my world

880
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,300
and whatever I might happen to wish to do with it.

881
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,980
The advantage of this is it allows us completely free play

882
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,740
within the domain of our experience

883
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,260
and within the domain of our mental activity.

884
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,220
The disadvantage of it is that it is a hopeless attempt

885
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,180
to avoid the external world.

886
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,180
And the problem is that the external world is still there

887
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,500
whether you like it or not,

888
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,820
as Dr. Johnson said, I refuted thus, there it is.

889
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,740
Bart thinks that this is another ideological construct

890
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,580
and that the external world is socially constructed,

891
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,780
linguistically constructed,

892
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,500
and we could simply unconstruct it if it gets in our way.

893
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,660
It's amazing the degree of egoism and wishful thinking

894
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,420
that you need to engage in

895
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,020
before you can argue a project like this.

896
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,580
It takes one set of presuppositions and radicalizes them,

897
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,780
take them as far as you can possibly go.

898
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,660
The problem is that the snake ultimately ends up

899
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,420
eating its own tail and the whole project disappears.

900
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,780
This is what we get when we get towards the end of Bart's life,

901
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,220
the last seven or eight years.

902
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,180
His work becomes intensely personal

903
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,500
and it's not clear at some times whether he's writing a novel

904
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
or whether he's writing a piece of literary criticism

905
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,980
or whether he's writing a series of essays

906
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,660
or whether he's writing one essay

907
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,620
or whether he's writing a book formally like that of Nietzsche

908
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
or say the Gay Science,

909
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,260
where it's just a series of vignettes

910
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,380
that don't really hold together.

911
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,060
He completely gives up on the idea of structure or form.

912
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,820
It all begins to break down

913
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,860
and this breakdown of literary structure,

914
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,820
this breakdown of communicative form,

915
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,740
is analogous to the breakdown of external reality.

916
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,740
And when we lose that direct mooring to the external world,

917
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,060
what happens is is that the self begins

918
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,700
to become contingent and dubious and fragmentary.

919
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,740
May I suggest that as Wittgenstein pointed out,

920
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,420
the self, like language, is socially constructed

921
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,500
and that when we try and remove ourselves

922
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,460
from the external world,

923
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,860
the result is that we end up talking to ourselves.

924
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,500
Now, I'm not certain that that's a problem for Bart.

925
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,700
I think that he finds this a sort of, how can I put it?

926
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,900
A sort of transcendence,

927
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,820
a sort of way of getting beyond the mere contingency,

928
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,900
the mere limitations of human life

929
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,300
towards some new external other realm.

930
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,100
In a way, I'd almost be tempted to say

931
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,060
that he's reinventing metaphysics

932
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,820
and instead of putting it somewhere else

933
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,820
outside of space and time,

934
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,220
he's putting it within the domain of his own consciousness

935
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,700
and then he's shooing away the rest of the world,

936
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,940
saying, I'll allow you to exist

937
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,420
if I decide to invent you linguistically,

938
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,500
but else wise, do not interfere with my activity.

939
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,220
I wish to be totally free.

940
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,660
So if Shakespeare were to come to him

941
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,980
and say, I think you're misinterpreting one of my plays,

942
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,300
he would say, well, what does your opinion

943
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,420
have to do with my freedom?

944
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,140
Get away from my face.

945
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,860
I have totally free play and what that amounts to

946
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,540
is the idea that Bart is a sort of anti-deadless.

947
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,940
If you know the deadless myth from Greek mythology,

948
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,660
he's the one who found the way out of the labyrinth.

949
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,980
Bart's reply is, labyrinth, what labyrinth?

950
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,220
I live here.

951
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,340
We're not trying to get out.

952
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,380
There is no out.

953
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,580
This is it.

954
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,820
You happen to be locked in your subjectivity

955
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,860
and the domain of your universe ends with your fingertips

956
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,740
and the idea that there is a way out of this problem

957
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,020
that will allow us to find the way the world really is

958
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,060
as opposed to the way the world is

959
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,060
within the domain of our semiotic system

960
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,580
is just the hopeless platonic dream of metaphysics

961
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,020
from the time of the ancient Greeks

962
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,220
to the time of the moderns, up to, say, Levy Strauss.

963
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,500
So what he's saying is, this is it.

964
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,660
I live here.

965
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,020
Get used to the absolute contingency of subjectivity

966
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,620
and get used to replacing all your other standards,

967
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,940
things like logical coherence or correspondence

968
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,140
to the external world, move away from all that reality

969
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,020
principle stuff just towards pleasure

970
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,180
because that's the only thing that could ever justify

971
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,740
any of your intellectual activity

972
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,140
and even that doesn't justify it.

973
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,580
There is no justification for intellectual activity.

974
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,820
What could we gesture at besides our own semiotic system?

975
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,060
And we're locked into that.

976
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,620
Semiotic systems are incommensurable and untranslatable.

977
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,900
And because they're incommensurable and untranslatable,

978
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,260
there's no necessarily conflict between Freudianism

979
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,140
and Marxism.

980
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,300
It's just there's no privileged position

981
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,220
from which we can decide that Freudianism,

982
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,660
as opposed to Marxism, is the true semiotic system

983
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,540
which discloses ultimate reality.

984
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,220
There's just no such thing.

985
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,980
There's an infinite number of perspectives, right?

986
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,260
And that means that we break down into a world

987
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,500
in which we're all profoundly lonely

988
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,780
and we have whole societies

989
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,900
composed of atomized individuals

990
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,140
speaking their own language, living in their own world.

991
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,940
Can you see how this is going to tend to liberate

992
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,540
the centripetal forces of the mind

993
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:36,140
and keep us from having any of those centrifugal forces

994
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,860
which hold language and society and culture together?

995
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,380
And can you see then why this is a negative critique

996
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,460
which finds certain tactical uses in asserting

997
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,020
that demythologizing is at least possible

998
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,660
or at least occasionally useful

999
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,020
in advancing left-wing politics?

1000
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,420
What we have here then is the artist or critic

1001
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,420
as political dilettante.

1002
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,180
In other words, Bart likes to pursue politics once in a while

1003
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,620
because he finds it pleasurable.

1004
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,260
And the sort of politics he likes to pursue

1005
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,340
is the politics which increases and extends his own pleasure.

1006
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,860
And the reason why he does it,

1007
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,460
well, at the fundamental level,

1008
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,660
it's because he finds it pleasurable.

1009
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,900
Pleasure is the only thing that one can refer to.

1010
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,500
But for tactical reasons,

1011
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,420
it may be useful not to suggest that.

1012
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,300
It may be worthwhile to write a book

1013
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,700
suggesting that left-wing myths

1014
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,140
are very different from right-wing myths

1015
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,220
and they're not nearly so mythological somehow.

1016
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
And what he's doing is just creating a meta myth,

1017
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,740
a new myth.

1018
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,660
And that means that we have a new order of poetry

1019
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,420
called literary criticism.

1020
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,820
We have a new order of critic

1021
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,780
who is now the ultimate poet

1022
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,980
because where the poets had to accept contingency

1023
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,700
and had to accept the simple determination

1024
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,940
of the external world,

1025
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,300
the critic is not bound by nature.

1026
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,540
The critic is trying to undermine nature.

1027
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,540
The critic flees from nature into the realm of the text.

1028
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,820
And that's why I think it's correct to describe Bart

1029
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,380
as anti-deadless,

1030
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,420
the guy who says stop asking the question

1031
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,900
of how to get out of the labyrinth.

1032
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,740
Stop asking the question of how to find substantial reality

1033
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,020
independent of your semiotic mythologizing.

1034
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,860
In fact, it's masks all the way down.

1035
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,340
And for that reason,

1036
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,900
he adopts a sort of ironic stance

1037
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,980
because what is there left for the critic to do?

1038
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,900
Certainly he can't communicate any reality

1039
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,540
about a text to anybody else

1040
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,140
because it won't be any more real

1041
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,420
than whatever they already believe

1042
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,100
and whatever they already think.

1043
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,820
The only thing he can do is indulge himself,

1044
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,860
is gratify his desire for pleasure

1045
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,660
by increasing the domain of his freedom

1046
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,420
so that it covers all communicative behavior.

1047
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,940
So it covers the whole set of signs.

1048
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,340
Nature, for example, is one of our signs

1049
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,260
for external coercion, the externality of things.

1050
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,420
Well, we can treat that as a myth as well.

1051
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,220
The whole world then becomes a human domain

1052
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,660
constructed by human beings in society

1053
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,020
and constructed by human beings in language.

1054
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,180
It is Cartesianism raised to a social collective level

1055
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,420
based not upon physics but upon aesthetics.

1056
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,540
For some reasons that I think are clear,

1057
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,900
Descartes such a great thinker,

1058
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,580
French culture has never been able to get out

1059
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,340
from under the shadow of Descartes.

1060
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,300
They all have a problem with either accepting

1061
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,740
their own selfhood or demonstrating the reality

1062
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,980
of the external world.

1063
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,100
It easily slips off into solitism

1064
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,100
if you start your philosophical investigations

1065
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,140
from the inside.

1066
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,640
It's gonna be so hard to make that jump to outside stuff.

1067
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,540
It may be there, but then again, it may not.

1068
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,900
Summing up then, let's think about what this amounts to.

1069
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,380
First of all, it's very clear that the demystifier,

1070
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,620
in this case, Bart, is also a remystifier,

1071
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,980
that the critic is an artist.

1072
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,380
This is a position of extreme solitude,

1073
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,520
a sort of epicurean withdrawal into the safety

1074
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,540
and sanctity and security of the soul.

1075
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,500
And the result is that we have an ironic metamith.

1076
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,100
He intends to communicate to us the fact

1077
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,900
that there's really nothing to communicate

1078
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,060
about these texts, except the fact

1079
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,260
that they are totally free and open

1080
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,260
and that there's no authority which you can refer to

1081
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,140
as coercing or limiting your interpretation.

1082
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,060
What I would say goes on here then,

1083
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,420
is that in constructing this Cartesian aesthetics,

1084
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,940
Bart makes readers little gods

1085
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,580
and gives them omnipotence over an infinite domain

1086
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,540
called the literary text.
