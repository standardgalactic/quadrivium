Tuan 
Nguyen
I am a self-admItted hardware addict. I 
love hardware. I obsess over hardware, 
and I’m always chasing the cutting edge. 
I’m also an early adopter, and that can 
be a problem at times. Some things just 
don’t work the way they’re supposed to 
when they’re new. For the most part, I 
haven’t had too many issues with being 
on the edge. There have been times when 
I’ve tried to convince myself to slow down. 
“There’s no need to keep upgrading,” I 
told myself. The self-hypnosis doesn’t 
seem very effective.
What we’ve done this issue is put 
together a list of the very best gear of the 
year. Only products we think are badass 
make it on to this coveted list—the kind 
of gear you’ll routinely find the staff here 
drooling over.
There have been countless times in 
my hardware life that I’ve lusted and 
drooled over hardware. The first time 
I got a CD-ROM drive was amazing. 
Optical technology, on an ultra-thin 
spinning disc? Want. A soundcard was 
an incredible piece of kit, too. For a long 
time, I had been hearing the musical 
horror that was the “PC speaker,” so 
having something that played realistic 
sounds was pretty mind-blowing.
Two of my next all-time favorite pieces 
of gear were the 3dfx Voodoo card from 
Diamond, and then the Rendition Verite 
1000. A company called Canopus made a 
custom 3dfx Voodoo 1 card that had 6MB 
of VRAM, instead of the standard 4MB 
of every other card. That Canopus card 
would definitely have made gear of the 
year if we were doing it back then.
  Nostalgia aside, there are all sorts 
of goodies this year that you can get your 
hands on. We obviously can’t put all the 
best gear into one issue, so I’m going to 
sneak in a few myself. Here are some of 
my personal picks for best gear of 2017:
• Devialet Phantom Gold speaker—
because I’m an audio nut.
• AMD Ryzen Threadripper—because 
challenging Intel is good for consumers.
• HGST He12 12TB helium hard drive—
because you really can’t ever have 
enough storage.
• Dell S718QL Advanced 4K laser 
projector—because lasers.
• MrSpeakers Ether Flow—the best 
headphones I ever had.
• Vertagear Triigger chair—if you’re 
going for a gaming chair, this is the one 
to get.
Lastly, I want to give a quick mention 
to Microsoft, for bringing back the 
much-loved Intellimouse, now called the 
Classic Intellimouse. This was the mouse 
that defined a generation, and continues 
to have an influence to this day. The 
original Intellimouse came out in 1996—
that’s 21 years ago—but it still feels 
great today, if you can get your hands on 
one. Thankfully, the new version is here 
now, complete with tastefully integrated 
white glow, and the same famous shape. 
I want one!

Huge hole found in Wi-Fi security standard
WPA2 Cracked  
with Krack
for encryption, because you can 
work  back  through  the  data, 
and  eventually  untangle  the 
keychain itself. 
A  successful  attack  would 
enable  complete  decryption 
of  all  data  you  send  over  a 
connection, passwords and all. 
It is also possible, depending on 
the  device  and  network  setup, 
to  read  data  going  the  other 
way,  too,  maybe  even  add  a 
little  malware  in  the  process. 
The  researchers  have  made 
a  successful  proof  of  concept 
attack, which is impressive and 
scary to watch.
Secure  websites  are  still 
secure; https provides another 
layer  of  encryption,  so  your 
banking details should be safe. 
Anything without a second layer 
is open, though, private emails 
and  images  included.  At  most 
risk is Linux and Android, which 
use  a  WPA2  client  that  can  be 
fooled  into  using  an  all-zero 
encryption  key.  Windows  and 
iOS  are  more  secure,  as  they 
don’t fully implement WPA2 (no 
real  surprise  there),  however 
nothing 
is 
immune. 
Before  we  all  start 
to  panic  unduly,  this 
is  still  only  a  concept  as 
yet, and has not, as far as we 
know,  escaped  the  laboratory. 
It also requires the attacker to 
be  within  range  of  your  Wi-Fi, 
sitting in the same coffee house, 
for example. 
The problem was discovered 
a  while  back—months  ago,  in 
fact.  As  with  all  such  major 
security  flaws  uncovered  by 
academics, the industry gets a 
heads-up  before  going  public. 
It  would  be  irresponsible  to 
announce such a gaping hole in 
security without giving time for 
patches to be made available. If 
you’ve  got  Windows  Automatic 
Update running as it should, you 
are  patched  as  of  October  10. 
If  you  are  running  Windows 
older than 7, you’re out of luck. 
Microsoft’s incentive to upgrade 
can be a little brusque at times. 
Apple took a little longer, but is 
now patched as well. Android is 
a  thornier  problem—there  are 
so many versions and varieties 
out  there,  one  patch  will  not 
cover  them  all.  Google  has 
pledged  to  fix  it,  so  keep  an 
eye  out  for  updates.  And  no, 
changing  your  Wi-Fi  password 
has no effect on this.
No 
security 
system 
is 
guaranteed 
secure, 
but 
heavyweight  encryption  has 
a  very  good  record.  Witness 
the  problem  the  FBI  has  with 
recovered 
encrypted 
cell 
phones,  more  than  half  of 
which  it  can’t  get  into.  It  can 
lead  to  a  sense  of  security, 
and  complacency  soon  follows 
that.  This  security  hole  is  not 
some  buffer  overflow  in  a 
particular  piece  of  software,  it 
is  a  fundamental  flaw  in  the 
protocol  itself,  and  potentially 
nasty. 
The 
Wi-Fi 
Alliance 
dropped the ball on this one. So, 
stay safe out there, and always 
install  those  recommended 
security patches. –CL
Wi-Fi ProteCted  Access  2 
(WPA2), the encryption protocol 
used  on  the  majority  of  Wi-Fi 
connections, 
has 
a 
major 
problem: Researchers from the 
University of Leuven in Belgium 
have  published  details  on  the 
so-called  Key  Reinstallation 
Attack—or  Krack,  for  short—
which  breaks  the  encryption 
wide  open.  The  problem  is 
fundamental  to  the  protocol, 
rather than any implementation 
of it, so everything using WPA2 
is at risk, which is millions upon 
millions of devices.
WPA2  uses  a  nonce,  an 
arbitrary  number  made  for 
the  process,  during  the  initial 
handshake  between  devices, 
during which the encryption key 
is generated for all subsequent 
traffic. Frequent reconnections 
are anticipated with Wi-Fi, and 
the same nonce is used to quickly 
re-establish 
a 
connection. 
This  is  the  weak  point.  An 
attacker can repeatedly send a 
handshake request and recover 
the  data  encrypted  using  the 
same  key.  This  is  bad  news 
A successful attack would 
enable decryption of all data 
you send over a connection.
The Krack vulnerability works 
because of an error of process 
at the root of WPA2, and affects 
everything using it—that’s 
more than two billion devices.

Tech Triumphs and Tragedies
When apple decided that the 3.5mm headphone jack just wasn’t 
cool enough, and dropped it, there was some consternation. 
Apparently, even at that size, it took up too much room, and 
wasn’t suitable for super-skinny hardware. Other makers soon 
followed, and it looked as though it was going to be “legacy” time. 
Now it appears the old dog may have a savior. Microsoft has been 
granted a patent on new forms of the socket, which can be used 
in devices thinner than the plug itself. There are three designs; 
all use a variation on an expanding socket, so part of the jack can 
project beyond the device. Simple and easy enough to engineer. 
Microsoft itself probably won’t be making use of the idea, though, 
as it has killed off the Windows phone. Let’s hope others do; wired 
headphones offer better sound, and don’t run out of charge. –cl

facebook is not 
spying on you
facebooK has publicly denied that it is spying on us by secretly listening through our 
cell phone’s microphone in order to better target advertisements. This follows months 
of rumors that this is exactly what it’s doing. The rumor is born out of Facebook’s almost 
uncannily accurate targeting. This was helped along by some seemingly convincing viral 
videos of people testing the theory out by talking about a previously untouched subject, 
only to see ads pop up for it later. Spooky stuff. Official denials on shady behavior from 
large corporations are never very convincing. The fact that they have to be made at all is 
worrying. However, it may be worth mentioning the frequency illusion at this point: The ads 
were there all the time, but you just didn’t notice them until you looked for them. If you are 
seriously worried, pop along to your settings, and revoke Facebook’s right to access your 
microphone. If that’s not enough, it may be time for tinfoil. –cl

The final specificaTions for version 4.0 
of PCI Express have been released, and 
once more we’re treated to a doubling of 
bandwidth. PCIe 4.0 runs at a base speed 
of 16GT/s. This translates to a little under 
2GB/s per lane, so your x16 graphics card 
will get a healthy 31.51GB/s of bandwidth to 
play around with. As ever, it’s fully backward 
compatible. This has been a long time in the 
making; it was first announced in 2011. 
Faster is better, of course. NVMe cards 
and RAID systems will be happy, but most 
current hardware is comfortable with PCIe 
3.0—it takes some serious gear to hit the 
buffers. Initially of more use is that you can 
halve the number of lanes for the same 
performance, saving those precious lanes 
for where you really need them. This is 
particularly important for processor PCIe 
controllers—these get full fast access to the 
CPU, and are in short supply. For example, 
many dual graphics card rigs have to share 
a x16 link, which is beginning to stretch the 
PCIe 3.0 specs. 
Along with the healthy speed bump, we 
get a host of tweaks, lower latency, better 
scalability, RAS, and so forth. We also 
have OCuLink-2, a cable standard similar 
to Thunderbolt, which can take PCIe lanes 
where needed. Power is up, too. It’s still 75W 
from the slot, but it allows for more than 
225W extra direct from the PSU, although 
details are sketchy as yet. Before you get 
too excited, all this is some way off. We need 
PCIe 4.0 controllers in consumer processors 
first, and that is probably still years away. 
AMD has slated 2020, Intel hasn’t committed 
yet, but is certainly keen to get Optane on to 
a faster bus. 
It doesn’t stop there, though—version 
5.0 has been outlined as well, and this 
doubles things yet again. The PCI Special 
Interest Group is talking about 2019 for this. 
However, given how long version 4.0 took to 
cook, we can probably take that with a pinch 
of salt. –cl

Intel’s Coffee Lake Makes 
Six-Core Mainstream
The i7-5820K dropped the entry price for six-core, 
12-thread chips to $389 in 2014—basically the same 
as today’s i7-8700K. The problem is that Intel’s 
mainstream platform, LGA115x, has stuck at four-
core, eight-thread since 2009’s first-gen Core i7s.
That’s eight years of stagnation, largely because 
AMD never had a superior product. Ryzen changed 
that, and while it doesn’t win every benchmark, the 
availability of competitive 8C16T chips at prices 
that undercut Intel’s 4C8T CPUs looks bad, and the 
6C12T Ryzen 5 parts cost less than most of Intel’s 
4C4T Core i5 parts. If you’re running workloads that 
can benefit from more cores/threads, Ryzen has 
been an easy recommendation since launch.
After coasting on the mainstream platform for 
eight years, Intel has been able to rapidly release 
more cores and higher performance. Coffee Lake 
has better per-core performance than Ryzen, and 
clock speeds that are up to 30 percent higher. What’s 
more, unlike the mesh topology used in Skylake-X, 
Coffee Lake sticks with Intel’s ring bus.
The result is some killer performance, with the i7-
8700K claiming top marks among 6C12T products. 
It’s also the fastest CPU I’ve ever tested from a 
gaming perspective, with stock clock speeds as 
high as 4.7GHz—despite only having a dual-channel 
memory controller. Not to be outdone, the i5-8400 is 
a 6C6T part that includes reasonable (3.8–4.0GHz) 
clocks, and in a large suite of games, it matches the 
performance of a stock i7-7700K—at about half the 
price and two-thirds the power use. 
The problem is that Coffee Lake uses the same 
LGA1151 socket as Skylake and Kaby Lake, except 
the pin-out has changed, and a new chipset and 
mobo is required. That’s a low blow, even from 
Intel, considering Z270 boards aren’t even a year 
Coffee Lake is both a significant upgrade to Intel’s mainstream CPU 
line, and one of the longest delays between meaningful improvements. 
If you’re an enthusiast who’s already upgraded to a six-core, 12-thread 
(6C12T) processor, Coffee Lake might not seem like a big deal. We’ve had 
such chips since Gulftown on socket LGA1366 in 2010, though pricing 
was higher than many were willing to pay. 
old. Coffee Lake is also the third new 
platform from Intel in 2017, which is 
insane. Add in AMD’s various Ryzen 
and Threadripper launches, and 
2017 is the most excitement we’ve 
seen in the CPU sector in ages.
If you upgraded to Kaby Lake, 
Ryzen, or Skylake-X, you don’t need 
to upgrade to Coffee Lake—but the 
desire to do so may be hard to resist. 
I also have to ding Intel for sticking 
with its cheaper and less desirable 
thermal interface material, instead 
of solder. I overclocked the i7-8700K 
to 4.8GHz, but without delidding, it 
hit nearly 100 C under load. Ouch!
As exciting as 2017 has been, 
there are indications 2018 won’t slow 
down. Rumblings from AMD hint 
at architectural tweaks enabling 
better per-core performance and 
higher clock speeds, and Ryzen 2 
(or whatever it’s called) will run in 
existing AM4 motherboards. Not to 
be outdone, Intel could release an 
8C16T Coffee Lake chip—though 
that would require a new die. And 
Intel’s 10nm Cannon Lake chips 
should finally arrive by the end of 
2018, possibly sooner. Here’s to 
competition, and more reasons 
to think about building another PC.
Coffee Lake still devotes a massive chunk of the processor die to 
graphics, which will largely go unused.

Our world is ruled by cell phones. The numbers of 
mobile devices in the world swamp those of PCs. But 
with this many devices, one would hope to see more 
operating system choices.
One such choice is on the horizon: Purism’s 
mobile Pure OS. Purism is a boutique PC maker that 
focuses on building privacy-respecting Linux PCs. 
The Librem 15, for example, allows for replacement 
of Wi-Fi card, storage, and RAM with minimal effort. 
Purism’s Pure OS, like System76’s Pop! OS, is a 
custom Linux flavor based on Debian. (Pop! OS is 
based on Ubuntu.) Like Pop! OS, desktop Pure OS 
is little more than a custom collection of stock apps, 
a desktop theme, plus drivers, and optimizations.
The Librem 15 features hardware kill switches 
for radios, and audio and video input (the mic and 
webcam). Purism’s phone, the Librem 5, promises 
much of the same. While hardware kill switches are 
rare in the PC world, they’re practically unheard of 
on mobile devices. Come to think of it, I see a lot of 
people with tape over the webcams of their PCs and 
MacBooks; I have never seen someone tape over 
their phone’s front or rear cameras.
On the surface, Android looks like a champion 
of open source. The dominant OS is a tweaked and 
twisted Linux derivative, after all. But for those who 
turn to Linux for privacy as well 
as security and stability, Android 
falls short. Taking Pure OS into the 
mobile space, Purism is offering 
privacy to users as well as flexibility. 
Pure OS will be a full-fledged Linux 
OS, and won’t require the user to set 
up an account with Google or Apple. 
The Librem 5 will be capable of 
running any other Linux OS, as well.
Even with its privacy features, 
Pure OS has a tough battle ahead. 
The Ubuntu Phone never came 
to fruition for business reasons. 
(Canonical found it could make 
more money focusing on enterprise 
solutions.) Firefox OS didn’t have 
enough airspeed to generate lift, 
let alone take-off. Even Microsoft 
failed to compete in the mobile 
space against Google and Apple.
Even 
developing 
bug-free 
Android flavors is tough. OnePlus 
had issues with the OnePlus 5 
that prevented users from making 
emergency (9-1-1) calls. 
If there’s one thing that Purism 
has to lean on, it’s the Linux 
community. At the time of writing, 
Purism had raised $1.6 million 
in crowdfunding for the Librem 5 
project, exceeding the $1.5 million 
goal that would “guarantee” the 
project’s 
completion. 
What’s 
probably more impressive is that 
Alex Campbell is a Linux geek 
who enjoys learning about 
computer security.

Linux PC Maker Raises 
$1.6 Million to Build Phone
It’s not every day that a boutique Linux PC maker sets 
out to build a phone to compete with Android and iOS 
devices. It’s even more rare to see such a project raise 
$750,000 in a week. But if you’re looking to face off with 
the top two most valued companies on the planet, you’re 
going to need more than money.
Purism raised half of the goal—
$750,000—in just one week. 
Purism has enlisted the help 
of the KDE and GNOME projects. 
Part of Purism’s strategy is to lean 
heavily on upstream development, 
and to focus on getting that 
software to run on the hardware. 
That’s a wise choice, especially as 
it won’t be incumbent on Purism to 
create a new convergent desktop, 
like Canonical attempted with Unity. 
It also won’t be up to Purism to fix 
Wayland’s shortcomings by itself.
In the world of mobile, Android is 
king. Google’s (mostly) open-source 
operating 
system 
has 
enjoyed 
wide global adoption, due to the 
relative openness of the platform 
and Google offering up the OS to 
hardware makers.
Do I like the idea of a privacy-
minded phone that has a fully open-
source OS? Of course I do. But given 
that the mobile battlefield is littered 
with the corpses of promising 
contenders, I’ll have to keep a bit of 
skepticism for now.
A concept for the Librem 5, as seen 
in Purism’s crowdfunding video.

BY Alex Cox
It’s a subjective tussle as old as time (OK, not quite that old). What should you be running? 
What will make your computing life easy, and what will make it a living hell of crashes and 
bugs? We’ve pulled in the three big operating systems: Windows, macOS, and (presented in 
catch-all broad strokes) the entire Linux ecosystem. We have repeatedly banged our heads 
against all three over the past couple of decades, not just as desktop operating systems, but 
as servers, single-task machines, and so on. So, we’ve chosen to pitch them in battle over 
five categories that really make a difference. Let’s fight!
Major Operating Systems
Slickness
Apple’s commitment to user experience 
is hugely evident in macOS, with all sorts 
of bells, whistles, and subtle niceties 
that make using it really rather pleasant. 
Aesthetically, it hasn’t changed a huge 
amount since the introduction of OS X in 
March 2001, apart from flattening out a 
little, but it’s had a bunch of navigational 
features tacked on—not all of which 
mesh together into a cohesive whole, it 
has to be said.
Windows is even more guilty of 
mixing up its styles. Recent iterations 
have seen a lot of simplification and 
forced 
friendliness 
crowbarred 
in, 
but plenty of old-school components 
remain, and this sometimes muddies 
the waters. Windows 10 is the slickest 
Microsoft OS yet, but its long legacy of 
minor changes means there’s plenty of 
inconsistency on board.
And Linux? Well, Linux can be 
wonderfully slick. If you were to install 
the right desktop, and piece together 
the perfect selection of widgets, you 
could make it amazing—you really 
are spoiled for choice. But then you’ll 
also need to put in the hours to make 
them work together without breaking, 
and whisper the secret magic word in 
exactly the right way. 
Winner: 
macOS
Hardware Compatibility
Windows’ advantage as the largest 
operating 
system 
means 
the 
vast 
majority of devices offer 100 percent 
compatibility with it, generally straight 
out of the box, at least in recent times. 
Get something new, plug it in, and it’ll 
work; if it doesn’t, the latest drivers 
are just a few clicks away, and they’re 
usually bang up to date with the latest 
patches and updates. 
The same cannot be said for Linux 
—while the hard work of its community 
means a huge amount of hardware 
works just fine through open-source 
drivers, many of which are built in to the 
kernel, and thus available right away, 
it’s rare for manufacturers to keep 
their drivers up to the same standard. 
The demand isn’t high enough to 
justify the effort, particularly given that  
closed-source drivers tend to make the 
open-source community foam at the 
mouth and bang their fists. 
The Mac’s narrow hardware platform 
gives it a big advantage when it comes 
to peripheral compatibility, and most 
manufacturers are happy to support 
it, but beware: Cook yourself up a 
Hackintosh, and you’ll find that forcing 
non-standard hardware to work with 
macOS is an arduous task.
Winner: 
Windows
Cost
Unless you’re picking up a niche 
distribution packed with closed-source 
components for a very specific business-
related purpose, with a support package 
tacked on to make sure someone else 
is on hand when you break it, Linux is 
absolutely free. You do not have to pay 
a single cent. Don’t like the version 
of Linux you’ve downloaded? Then go 
grab another, and don’t pay for that 
one either. 
Credit, almost, to Microsoft as well: 
It made Windows 10 a free upgrade for 
a while (a semi-charitable way to push 
as many users on to its new operating 
system as possible), and seems to have 
dropped the concept of new paid-for 
upgrades altogether. Buy a Windows 
10 Home license for $119 and, if things 
stay as they are, you’re set ad infinitum, 
at least until you need to install another 
copy on a new machine.
Apple hasn’t ditched new versions, but 
it no longer charges for them. Indeed, it 
hasn’t sold an operating system directly 
since OS X Snow Leopard, and that can 
be had for only 20 bucks if you need to 
refresh an old machine. The meat of 
macOS, and its subsequent updates, are 
paid for by the premium you have to pay 
for Mac hardware. 
Winner: 
Linux

Versatility
There’s a flavor of Linux for just about 
everything you can think of. From 
incredibly specific single-serving uses 
to desktops, servers, and enterprise 
machines, 
someone 
has 
probably 
already done the hard work of piecing 
together a custom distro. Even if they 
haven’t, it’s entirely possible to do it 
yourself, with distros such as Slackware 
and the Linux From Scratch project 
helping you start from nothing and 
build from there. Linux is also suited 
to a much wider range of hardware 
platforms. It can run on ARM devices, 
and you can find distros that run well on 
very old hardware. 
Windows 10 comes in many (very 
similar) flavors, there’s a little ARM 
support in the form of the free Windows 
IoT, and the Windows Server enterprise-
level series exists, but that’s the end 
of the line. Apple, meanwhile, doesn’t 
even go that far: You can have macOS, 
or macOS with the Server upgrade, 
purchasable from the App Store. Of 
course, it only takes a little imagination 
to use Windows or macOS for whatever 
task you decide to set them to, but 
Linux’s open-ended structure means 
it’s what the operating system was 
meant to do from the start.
Winner: 
Linux
Software
If you’re a gamer, you want Windows—
no question. Developers simply aren’t 
inclined to pour resources into putting 
games on niche platforms—see Valve’s 
not-entirely-successful Steam Machine 
project for proof. That’s not to say 
there’s not a large selection of games 
available for Linux or macOS, but you’ll 
find a lot more for Windows.
Creative software has traditionally 
had a home within the stable, work-
friendly environment of macOS, and 
it’s certainly a great choice for hosting 
Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite. However, 
running Windows doesn’t preclude you 
from doing that, and—again—Windows’ 
ubiquity is a huge factor in its software 
selection, with stacks more practical 
apps on offer. 
Let’s just not talk about the Windows 
Store, though: it’s awful. Apple has 
fared much better with the App Store 
on macOS, but Linux scrapes it here. 
It’s built around distribution networks, 
which pull the right software for your 
machine, and install it automatically. 
Yes, with a little cunning using WINE, 
you can convince just about any Windows 
app to run emulated on any platform, but 
we have to give this to Microsoft’s OS in 
the end. Why work for it?
Winner: 
Windows
This clash was by no means a foregone 
conclusion, and objectively it’s fair 
to say that no OS truly dominates. 
Perhaps the results don’t match your 
own feelings or experiences. We 
won’t argue. That’s the thing about 
operating systems: They’re subjective, 
and they’re personal. They’re the 
direct connection between you and 
your computing experience, and your 
own choice is going be based on what 
matters to you most. 
For us, Windows wins, primarily 
because being part of the largest 
crowd means you get the biggest 
software benefits, the widest range 
of support, and updates generally hit 
Windows first. Despite all this, it wasn’t 
an easy win for Redmond’s juggernaut 
OS, and that wide user base puts a 
malware-shaped sting in its tail.
As pleasing as macOS is to use, 
getting it on any non-Mac hardware 
means shattering a lengthy EULA, 
and potentially a lot of work toward 
hardware compatibility—but the same 
is not true in reverse. And as mature 
as Linux has become, and as ethically 
noble as it is, we still can’t trust its 
stability as a daily desktop. 
And the
Winner Is…
ROUND 4
ROUND 5
macOS: A collection of small iterations and 
Apple’s customary clean lines.
Windows: Constantly evolving and the biggest 
operating system going.
Linux: Sometimes sexy (like Zorin, pictured), 
but always practical.

SLI Done Right
Dear Doctor, I finally joined 
the SLI club with a pair of 
EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 
FTW3 Elite Gaming 11GB 
GDDR5X cards. I also have a 
trio of Asus monitors that I 
hook up via DisplayPort.
What is the protocol for 
connecting my monitors and 
retaining SLI support? Each 
cards has three DP outputs, 
totaling six DP connectors.
 
–Jerry Franco, Jr
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
According to Nvidia’s Surround 
Configuration Tool, there 
are seven viable options for 
enabling SLI across as many 
as five displays. You need to 
use one DisplayPort connector 
on each card, then a third 
DisplayPort output on either 
the left or right card. This 
narrows the original seven 
possibilities down to three.
Just make sure your center 
(primary) display is connected 
to the left-most card, looking 
at their I/O brackets from the 
back of your PC.
Overclocking 
Hi, Doc. I’ve been a reader of 
your magazine for some time, 
and I immediately head to 
“Ask the Doctor” each month. 
Being from England, some 
terminology is different, but 
the whole PC hardware scene 
is the same otherwise.
My question is simple, I 
hope. I have an Intel Core 
i7-7700K CPU, and I’m curious 
about overclocking. I’ve never 
modified a processor, but I’d 
like to get more performance 
out of this chip. The whole 
balance between higher 
voltages and non-standard 
bus speeds worries me, 
though. Is there an easy-
to-use app that facilitates 
adjustments without the 
danger of throwing too many 
volts at my CPU? –Ade Davis
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Just 
one generation ago, Intel’s Core 
i7-7700K was the company’s 
fastest quad-core CPU for LGA 
1151-based mobos (now the 
Core i7-8700K gets that honor). 
A 4.2GHz base clock rate was 
unprecedented at the time, and 
Turbo Boost pushed the chip as 
high as 4.5GHz.
How much headroom is 
there left to exploit? An extra 
500MHz, getting you to 5GHz, 
isn’t unreasonable. You need a 
good thermal solution, though. 
Consider a closed-loop liquid 
cooler, such as Corsair’s H110, 
or a big heatsink and fan, such 
as Noctua’s NH-D15. You also 
need a Z170 or Z270-based 
mobo. The enthusiast-oriented 
chipsets make it possible to 
adjust the 7700K’s multiplier, 
whereas Intel’s mainstream 
platform controller hubs are 
not designed for overclocking.
Now, you mentioned being 
concerned about non-standard 
bus speeds. Fear not! The best 
reason to own a K-series CPU 
is its unlocked multiplier, so 
you can leave the BCLK at its 
default 100MHz. Overclocking 
is achieved by fiddling with 
the ratio limits. You can 
synchronize all the cores to 
make them operate at the same 
frequency, or create a curve 
that relaxes the clock rate 
under more taxing workloads. 
In the former scenario, a 50x 
multiplier pushes four cores to 
5GHz. The latter might specify 
50x when one core is active, 49x 
when two cores are used, and 
48x for three and four cores.
Reaching those frequencies 
(and making them stable) 
requires more voltage. It’s hard 
to say with certainty what’s 
safe. Up to around 1.25V works 
for experimenting with a big 
ASRock’s Z170M Extreme4 motherboard should support 
memory speeds up to DDR4-3466, given the right modules.

heatsink/fan, while water 
cooling buys enough margin for 
a little more, say around 1.3V.
The Doc favors dialing in 
adjustments directly to his 
motherboard’s UEFI, locking 
them in. But if you want a 
Windows-based utility, check 
out the Extreme Tuning Utility 
(XTU), available from Intel’s 
website. Its “Basic Tuning” 
menu lets you toy around with 
core and cache ratios, while the 
“Advanced Tuning” page opens 
up more detailed performance 
and voltage options. Built-in 
benchmarking and hardware 
monitoring panes are useful for 
testing your overclock before 
committing it to the BIOS.
Super Screen
Hey Doc, I wonder if you could 
help me pick out a monitor. 
My HP ZR30w is 10 years old, 
and I just built a gaming PC 
with a Core i7-7700K on an 
Asus ROG Maximus IX Hero, 
a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, 32GB 
of G.Skill DDR4 memory, a 
512GB Samsung 960 Pro, 
2TB Samsung 850 EVO, 6TB 
WD Black hard drive, and a 
Seasonic 1,000W PSU.
I want a new monitor, but 
there is not a single one that I 
would upgrade to. I know what 
I want: a 32-inch 3840x2160 
IPS-based display, with HDR 
and 144Hz G-Sync. It doesn’t 
exist, though. I don’t want to 
switch between a 32-inch 4K 
panel at 60Hz for some games 
and a 27-inch 1440p one at 
144Hz for others. This leaves 
me to choose between one or 
the other. Which would you 
pick? I don’t really want an 
ultra-wide monitor because I 
still play a lot of older games.
How have manufacturers 
messed up on sizing and 
resolution? Pixel pitch should 
be taken into account. A 4K 
monitor should never be less 
than 32-inch, and 27-inch 
is perfect for a 2560x1440 
screen. I read about the Asus 
ROG Swift PG27UQ, and was 
disappointed in its size and 
DPI. It should be 32-inch.
I apologize for the rant, 
but it’s concerning when 
companies cannot make 
what gamers want. 
–Dave
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: If 
you’re unwilling to compromise 
on those specs, you’ll be waiting 
a while longer. Asus’s ROG Swift 
PG27UQ and Acer’s Predator 
X27 come closest, as you know. 
But their AU Optronics AVHA-
based panels are limited to 27-
inch. And that size isn’t trivial 
to manufacture. Recently, both 
Asus and Acer announced their 
respective models are delayed 
until early 2018.
While it sounds like you’ve 
done enough research to know 
what you want, don’t write off 
smaller 4K screens. The Doc 
has a 28-inch Acer XB280HK 
and a 27-inch ViewSonic 
XG2700-4K in his lab for 
G-Sync/FreeSync testing, and 
despite their 60Hz refresh 
rates, games look great at 4K 
on both. If you’re worried about 
tiny icons/text in Windows, 
display scaling was greatly 
improved in Win 10, worked 
on more for the Anniversary 
Update, and made even better 
in the Creators Update.
Even if there was a monitor 
with all of your requisites, a 
single GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 
averages 60–100fps in many 
modern titles at 3840x2160, 
with details cranked up. Given 
waning support for SLI as 
DirectX 12 becomes more 
popular, a second card would 
only help in some of your older 
titles you enjoy playing. 
Choppy Playback
Dear Doc, I have a Sony FDR-
AX53 4K video camera and 
recorded hours of content on 
a trip to Hawaii (in XAVC-S 
mode at 3840x2160). I want to 
play it back on my Samsung 
UN65KS9000 UHD TV, but it’s 
only smooth if I output from 
the camera to the TV via HDMI. 
If I copy files from my SDXC 
(Class 10/UHS-3) memory 
card to my HTPC (an Intel 
NUC), the content is choppy.
What is the best way to save 
and play back 4K (XAVC-S) 
content? Can I burn to a Blu-
ray DVD and play from my 4K 
DVD player? Is a high-end 
NAS with Plex Media Server 
or Video Station on a Synology 
system the answer? I don’t 
want to store all of my content 
on memory cards and use the 
camera for playback. 
–Nick
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 4K 
video playback is demanding. 
Have you tried monitoring 
resource utilization to gauge 
whether your host processor is 
struggling? Every generation 
of Intel’s NUC boasts H.264 
decode acceleration. Since the 
XAVC-S format is based on the 
H.264 codec, your playback 
software should be able to 
offload some of the task.
Lacking enough information 
to diagnose your issue more 
thoroughly, rule out over-taxed 
hardware first. Then, make 
sure your software supports 
what you’re trying to do. 
There is no technical reason 
MP4-wrapped content shouldn’t 
play back smoothly, and moving 
those files to a networked 
device simply adds another 
variable to troubleshoot.
Troubleshooting RAM
Hi Doctor, I’m having an issue 
getting the memory in my PCs 
running at its rated speed, 
rather than the motherboards’ 
default. Both systems contain 
ASRock Z170M Extreme4 
motherboards. One sports 
an Intel Core i3-6100, and the 
other is based on a Core i5-
6600. Both sets of memory are 
from Corsair. The first is a 4x 
4GB CMK16GX4M4B3000C15 
kit, which is not on the 
supported memory list 
(though others in the family 
are). The second is a 2x 8GB 
CMU16GX4M2C3000C15 kit, 
which is on the supported 
memory list. Both 
motherboards are running 
the current BIOS (7.20).
The default memory speed 
is DDR4-2133, and both PCs 
are fine as long as I maintain 
that data rate. But if I try to 
use the XMP profile to get 
them going at DDR4-3000, I 
start getting random crashes 
and start-up errors. I’ve 
tried using different memory 
configurations, including 
swapping the sticks from one 
computer to the other, and 
using one stick on each board, 
but I get the same issues. I 
even RMA’d one motherboard, 
thinking that might be the 
problem (it wasn’t).
Is there any way to set 
up the BIOS to make these 
motherboards stable at the 
memory’s top speed? 
–Dan Z
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Crashes and errors sound 
like they could be related to 
insufficient voltage. Corsair 
states that its DDR4 modules 
include two XMP profiles. One 
operates at 1.2V and is officially 
supported; the second specifies 
1.35V and is not. Make sure 
you’re using the one with a 
higher voltage setting. If a kit is 
on ASRock’s compatibility list, it 
should work.
Start by experimenting 
with the supported 
CMU16GX4M2C3000C15 
modules and your Core i5. 
The other kit was designed for 
X99 platforms, and may have 
other parameters that affect 
compatibility with Z170. 
The Intel Extreme Tuning Utility gives you access to overclocking 
knobs and dials from the Windows desktop.

   Year
of  
the 
2017 has been an incredible year 
for hardware. Here are our picks  
of the best hardware from the 
previous 12 months By the Max PC teaM
The PC indusTry rarely sits twiddling its thumbs, but 
2017 was an incredible period by any standard. We’ve 
seen impressive new processor releases that we may 
not feel the full effect of for some years (competition 
is great for pushing things forward), cryptocurrencies 
reinventing graphics card pricing, more RGB LEDs 
than you could shake a cracked kyber crystal at, and 
a general focus on the whole PC ecosystem to make it 
more powerful and more customizable. 
The timing of these advances is no accident, with 
the way we’re using PCs continuing to develop in 
new directions, while reinvigorating older ones. The 
consoles that have diverted resources away from PCs 
for so long have had a faltering start with their next-
generation platforms, so the PC has returned to the 
fore as the number one gaming platform. But PCs are 
far more than just gaming systems, and even gamers 
are doing a lot more with their systems—streaming 
while gaming is commonplace, and that takes a lot of 
power. Throw in image and video editing, programing, 
website building, office work, rendering, and all 
manner of other pastimes, and all the power that the 
latest releases is unleashing is eagerly snapped up. 
Over the next few pages, we highlight the gear that 
impressed us most over the last year. The hardware 
that stood above the crowd and not only showed what 
was possible now, but where the PC could go next. 
2018 already looks like it’s going to keep pushing 
things forward, though we doubt it will reach the 
heights of the last 12 months—but, hey, we can hope.

Corsair one Pro
Corsair may be more synonymous with 
peripherals, but its first pre-built 
system absolutely delivers. Taking the 
company’s knowledge of cooling, the 
One Pro uses a single large fan to draw 
air through the system in order to keep 
the high-end components cool, without 
making a racket while doing so—at 
idle, it trundles along at just 20dB. It 
also looks absolutely gorgeous, with its 
Tron vibe and satin finish making for a 
truly premium piece of gear. The 
performance is excellent for a single-
card system, too, and for the money, 
you’d be hard pushed to do better 
yourself. Outstanding.

The Optimus Prime looks aren’t going 
to be to everyone’s tastes, but the 
hardware you’ll find throbbing away 
inside this tilted goliath could well 
have dissenters keeping their doubts in 
check. This is unquestionably a powerful 
machine: It packs a Core i7-7700K 
clocked at 4.2GHz, 64GB of RAM, 2x 
512GB M.2 NVMe drives, and a pair of 
GeForce GTX 1080s in SLI. It tears apart 
our more serious benchmarks, but 
that’s obviously not what it’s built to 
do—it was designed to demolish games, 
and it does that with consummate ease. 
If you’re looking for an unashamed 
gaming system, this is it.

There are many ways that system 
builders can impress, but shipping a 
machine with one of the highest-
clocked Kaby Lake Core i7s we’ve 
seen is a good starting point (4.9GHz, 
in case you were wondering). Toss in a 
pair of GTX 1080s in SLI, 32GB of 
RAM, and a 512GB Samsung 960 Pro, 
and you end up with a machine that 
eats most things you can think of 
throwing at it. It’s a chunky machine 
for sure, although not as big as some 
of the systems we’ve looked at, but 
it’s beautifully built, with a great eye 
for detail, and it’s a performance 
monster as well.

origin PC Chronos
We see plenty of powerful machines 
here at Maximum PC, and quite a few 
smaller ones, but few that manage to 
check both boxes. The Chronos is an 
exception to that rule, with its sub-
console footprint hiding some incredible 
internal components: Along with the 
10-core, 20-thread Core i7-6950X, you’ll 
find a GeForce GTX 1080, 16GB of RAM, 
and a 6TB hard drive to complement the 
main 512GB Samsung 950 Pro M.2 drive. 
The Chronos performed brilliantly in our 
benchmark suite, and the general build 
quality really impressed us. Obviously, 
it’s tightly packed inside, so upgrading 
isn’t simple, but it is possible.

origin eon17-slx
Laptops tend to fall into one of two 
camps—either thin and light or huge 
and powerful. The EON17-SLX falls 
squarely into the second grouping: 
This thing is a beast, both in terms 
of size and weight, and in terms of 
performance. It may be a laptop, but it 
boasts a desktop-beating spec. You’ll 
find a desktop Core i7-7700K in here, 
not one of those lesser mobile 
models. That 17-inch 4K 
screen would be a 
challenge for any gaming 
system, so it makes sense 
for there to be a pair of GeForce 
GTX 1080 GPUs powering it. And 
power it they do—60fps is more than 
just a dream, even with the latest 
games at the highest settings.

asus rog ZePhyrus 
gx501Vi
A traditional gaming laptop is a big and 
bulky beast. Nvidia’s Max-Q design 
changed that, by limiting the power 
draw and setting thermals for its GPUs, 
to make sure that it will fit in thinner 
machines. The Zephyrus was one of the 
first Max-Q systems we looked at, and it 
sure is an impressive ultra-slim gaming 
laptop. The resultant performance may 
be a shade off that offered by bigger 
laptops, but it’s powerful enough to 
hit smooth frame rates in the latest 
games at the highest settings. So, a 
compromise, but one that still delivers, 
and doesn’t sound like a jet engine when 
it’s strutting its stuff.

Dell xPs 15
The Dell XPS 15 is probably the 
closest thing the PC has got to a 
competitor to the Apple MacBook Pro, 
which may well be enough for some. 
It is actually an incredible machine in 
its own right, though, with its 4K 
Infinity Edge display featuring one of 
the smallest bezels anywhere, making 
for a great-looking machine. The core 
components are impressive, too, and 
while it’s not quite a gaming 
specification, the mobile Nvidia 
GeForce GTX 1050 means you 
can get most things running 
on it with only a little 
tinkering (but not at the

gaming is a secondary requirement

Asking a desktop to run a 4K panel at 
60fps is a big ask, so it feels unfair to 
demand the same from a laptop, but 
that’s exactly what Eurocom has 
managed to do with the Sky X9E2. This 
may have a frankly ludicrous price tag, 
but it rises to the challenge of extreme 
gaming, and delivers in spades. Dual 
GeForce GTX 1080s in SLI give it 
ridiculous gaming grunt, and as this is 
a non-Max-Q machine, it doesn’t hold 
back. The rest of the specification is 
just as uncompromising, resulting in 
a system that really is the stuff of 
dreams, as long as you don’t mind 
those dreams being hot and noisy.

This has been a mainstay of our 
mid-range build since release, 
which goes someway to showing 
how reliable it is, and what great 
value it offers. We’re big fans of 
its looks, with its tempered 
glass side panel, tight lines, and 
powder-coated finish making for 
some great-looking systems. 
There are options to have a 
colored cable management bar 
and Psu cover, which also hold 
an ssD mount—though the 
black and white models look 
great, too. The fact that the top 
i/o connectors include an hDMi 
pass-through for Vr 
connections is the icing 
on the cake. a lot of case

When you’re looking at a high-end 
build, you want the case to stand 
out from the crowd, but also keep 
everything you have in it cool. 
The shogun checks those boxes 
brilliantly, with its unique styling, 
support for varied cooling options, 
and enough neat touches to show 
off the components where it counts. 
The slanted tempered glass side 
panels add a point of interest, while 
the rgB leD-lit ssD mounting 
panel means that your drives can 
be put on display while also hiding 
your Psu’s cables. There’s plenty 
of room to build in and house 
top-drawer components, as well as 
accommodate the radiators for your

AMD may have revitalized high-end 
CPUs with Threadripper, but in a 
way, it only feels fair that Intel 
still carries away the performance 
crown. This is purely because its 
most expensive consumer chip also 
happens to be the most pimped-out 
piece of silicon to ever roll off its 
production lines. The Core i9-
7980XE is an 18-core, 36-thread 
chip that packs 24.75MB of smart 
cache. Its nominal operating 
frequency of 2.6GHz may seem 
pedestrian, but it rarely runs at 
that speed, usually being far closer 
to its Max Turbo of 4.2GHz. Yes, it’s 
ridiculously expensive, but then at 
the same time, if you want (or 
need) the very best, this is it. 
$2,099, www.intel.com
So, while Intel’s Core i9-7980XE takes the award for all-out 
performance, it should come as no surprise that AMD’s 
top Threadripper scoops the prize for more sane high-end 
computing. At just less than half the cost of Intel’s behemoth, 
but still packing a frankly ridiculous 16 cores and 32 threads, 
32MB of L3 cache, support for 64 PCIe lanes, and running at 
3.4GHz with a Max Turbo of 4GHz, on paper, at least, there 
isn’t much difference between the two chips. In practice, 
Intel does have the lead, but if you’re looking for a serious 
CPU to build a machine around that won’t break the bank too 
much, then AMD is the way to go for us. 
$970, www.amd.com
Expensive, multithreading 
monsters aside, what has 2017 
given us in terms of more 
consumer-friendly desktop CPUs? 
Why, Ryzen, of course. To be 
honest, it’s hard picking one 
chip that’s definitely worth 
recommending over the rest, 
but the top-end package that 
is the Ryzen 7 1800X, with its 
eight physical cores, and ability to 
handle 16 threads, ultimately gets 
the nod. It’s an incredible number-
crunching powerhouse that proves 
that AMD not only still has what it 
takes to produce a competitive 
chip, but that it can force Intel’s 
hand to move things forward, 
too. The initial teething problems 
concerning memory compatibility 
have been sorted, and this is easily 
the most impressive technological 
advance of the last 12 months.

The X299 chipset makes 
for a confusing platform, 
covering everything from 
the $250 quad-core Core 
i5-7640X all the way up 
to the 18-core, 36-thread 
Core i9-7980XE. Ignore those 
confusing, and mostly irrelevant, 
lesser models, though, and you’ll 
realize that the platform packs a 
serious performance and feature-
rich punch. This MSI mobo takes 
that notion to its logical conclusion, 
boasting a slew of features that 
you’ll actually care about when 
building a high-end machine. It 
also looks the part, with its 
subdued color scheme. It’s good for 
flexing your overclocking muscles 
as well, thanks to its intuitive BIOS 
and quality component choices. 
$380, www.msi.com
The role of the motherboard continues to shift. Where once 
it was a vital cog in the performance machine, these days, 
there’s little to separate a budget offering from the best 
money can buy. That’s not to say that there aren’t 
differences, but they’re mostly with regard to features, 
aesthetics, or making it easier to overclock your chip of 
choice. The Crosshair VI Hero manages to impress on 
all these fronts, with an impressive feature list, great 
overclocking support, and all at a reasonable price. Anyone 
looking to pick up an AM4 motherboard to go with their new 
Ryzen processor could do a lot, lot worse. 
$255, www.asus.com
Such is the way of the world that 
one of the best motherboards to be 
released in the last year is for a 
processor family that hasn’t had 
much to shout about. The Gigabyte 
Z270X-Ultra Gaming packs an 
incredible number of features into 
its wallet-pleasing price tag. Stock 
performance is strong, with plenty 
of scope for overclocking, if you’re 
happy to familiarize yourself with 
the BIOS. The design is surprisingly 
sober, too, as the more affordable 
gaming models tend to go down the 
dragons and damsels route all too 
often. We’ll obviously be looking at 
more eighth-gen motherboards 
over the coming months, but this 
board does show that quality 
offerings can come a little late 
to the party and still impress.

While there are a lot of players 
in the SSD space, one company 
consistently manages to impress 
where others have faltered, and 
that’s Samsung. The 960 Pro M.2

it’s available in capacities that

but the fact that our only recommendation for a pixel-

in a little cryptocurrency madness, and it’s a year that 
many of us would sooner forget from a GPU perspective. 
Don’t let that detract from the greatness of the GeForce

any metric. With its 3,584 CUDA cores, 224 texture units,

That said, there’s one panel that has stood out this last

Intel’s 8th GeneratIon core processors have landed. 
They’re the most exciting mainstream CPUs from Chipzilla 
in at least five years. But also the most confusing. In fact, 
Intel’s 8th Generation Core isn’t really a generation of 
CPUs at all. It’s more a collection of products with common 
branding than a distinct generation of processors with 
something approaching a homogeneous feature set.
Eventually, 8th Gen Core will contain CPUs from three 
generations of processor design, and be manufactured 
on two silicon production nodes. But even with three 
generations and two production nodes, 8th Gen Core chips 
don’t include Intel’s new multi-core chips that range from 
10 to 18 cores. Those fall under the 7th Gen banner. Intel 
never makes it easy to understand its product range.
If Intel’s marketing can be utterly baffling at the best of 
times, 8th Gen Core remains really good news for the most 
part. For starters, we’re looking at the first major step 
forward in mainstream desktop CPU performance from 
Intel for a very long time. In simple terms, you’re getting 
more cores at every mainstream price point. Hurrah! 
Mobile performance and battery life are on the up, too. 
Where the confusion comes in is that, unlike previous 
generations, where being a part of a specific Generation of 
Core processor meant something in terms of features and 
capabilities, the simple fact of a CPU being 8th Gen doesn’t 
tell you much. Instead, you’re going to have to stay on your 
toes to keep up with the pros and cons of Intel’s new range.
With that in mind, we’ve drawn together everything you 
need to know about these new CPUs. From poverty priced 
entry-level chips to mobile masterpieces and desktop 
killers that set new performance standards at certain price 
points, we’ve got the full low-down. So, now you’ll know 
what to expect, where the best bang for buck is to be found, 
and which chips fit best with your PC usage. Let it rip!

Whatever happened to 10nm?
With Intel stringing 
its 14nm production 
node out to at least 
four generations (that’s 
generations with a small 
“g”) of Core processors, and 
having officially delayed 
the 10nm node, is Moore’s 
Law dead? Moore’s Law, of 
course, is the observation 
that computer chips double 
in complexity or halve in 
cost—or some mix of the 
two—every couple of years.
The simple answer is 
yes. If you define Moore’s 
Law by that rigid two-
year time frame, then it’s 
probably done and dusted. 
Progress with conventional 
computer chips will 
continue, but at the slower 
pace we’re already seeing. 
After all, Intel’s first 14nm 
processors went on sale 
in late 2014. Nearly three 
years later, we’ve yet to see 
any 10nm chips, even if Intel 
is promising them by the 
end of the year.
You could argue some 
new paradigm is needed, be 
that quantum computing or 
some other fundamentally 
new technology, if the 
next 40 years or so are to 
be anything like the last 
40 years when it comes to 
the growth in computing 
performance. In the shorter 
term, however, the fact that 
Intel is no longer shrinking 
its transistors on a regular 
biannual cadence isn’t 
the end of the world. Intel 
has shown with the 14nm 
process that significant 
gains can be had in terms 
of power consumption, 
courtesy of revising an 
existing process.
Of course, smaller circuit 
features aren’t just about 
power consumption. They 
also allow more transistors 
to be made available, or the 
same number of transistors 
at a lower cost. But even 
limited access to larger 
transistor counts might 
not be a total disaster.
One effect of Moore’s 
Law over the years has 
arguably been a certain 
inefficiency in chip design. 
Put simply, engineers have 
always been able to hurl 
more transistors at a given 
computational problem. But 
with Moore’s Law coming to 
an end, chip designers will 
be much more incentivized 
to hone and polish their 
designs. Odds are, quite a 
bit of performance has been 
left on the table over the 
years. Clawing some of that 
back should buy several 
generations’ worth of 
performance improvements 
while the industry searches 
for an alternative to the 
conventional silicon-based 
integrated circuit.
ChronoloGICally 
speakInG, 
Intel’s 
8th Generation CPUs began where it 
so often does these days: with a mobile 
CPU announcement. But right off the bat, 
something wasn’t quite right. A quartet of 
new “U” Series mobile processors debuted 
the 8th Generation nomenclature, including 
8000 Series branding. But they were based 
on neither a new silicon production node nor 
a new processor architecture. Seriously?
That’s worth repeating. Intel is calling 
the chips 8th Generation, but they are 
manufactured on 14nm production tech, 
which dates back to the Broadwell 
generation in 2014. Since then, Intel has 
revised its 14nm offerings with the Sky Lake 
and Kaby Lake architectures. So, this would 
be the fourth new CPU family on the 14nm 
node, although Intel characterizes it as a 
revved-up “14nm+” process, with improved 
transistor fins, increased channel strain, 
and other tweaks that add up to a claimed 
12 percent performance increase from 
process improvements alone. 
That’s unprecedented for Intel. Not long 
ago, Intel used to design CPUs to conform 
to its so-called Tick-Tock cadence of chip 
creation, in which the aim was to crank out a 
new architecture, then shrink it to a smaller 
production node in successive years. But in 
early 2016, Intel announced it was ditching 
Tick-Tock in favor of Process, Architecture, 
Optimization. In other words, in year one, 
Intel would shrink an existing CPU to a 
smaller silicon production node. In year 
two, it would release a new architecture on 
that new node. And in year three, it would 
revise and optimize that new architecture.
The move was an implied admission 
that Moore’s Law is toast. Along with the 
rest of the integrated circuit industry, Intel 
is increasingly bumping up against the 
laws of physics. Shrinking its transistors 
every other year is no longer a goer. But 
that much we already knew before 8th Gen 
Core arrived. The surprising thing about 
those first mobile processors is that they 
don’t even conform to Intel’s new Process, 
Architecture, Optimization cadence. In fact, 
they’re a mildly tweaked revision of the 
existing 14nm Kaby Lake architecture. 
Arguably, of course, that’s just details. 
What really matters is that with the new 8th 
Gen U Series mobile CPUs, Intel replaced a 
quartet of dual-core models with quad-core 
CPUs, and is doing so at slightly lower price 
points. The one downside involves clock 
speeds. Peak Turbo frequencies have been 
maintained or even improved, but base 
clocks have reduced a little. That reflects 
the fact that doubling the core count and 
maintaining both frequencies and power 
consumption, even with a tweaked 14nm+ 
process, is a non-starter.
As for specifics, at the bottom end of 
the relevant U Series range, Intel used 
to offer the Core i5-7260U for $304. For 
that you got two cores and four threads 
clocked at 2.2GHz base and 3.4GHz Turbo. 
Now, Intel will sell you the Core i5-8250U 
with four cores and eight threads, a base 
clock of 1.6GHz, and a top Turbo speed of 
3.4GHz. And it will set you back just $297. 
Nice. At the other end of this U Series scale 
used to be the Core i7-7660U, a dual-core, 
quad-thread 2.5/4.0GHz model for $415. Its 
replacement is the Core i7-8650U, a quad-
core, eight-thread puppy rocking 1.9/4.2GHz 
frequencies, and yours for $409.
If that’s the good news on the mobile side, 
the bad is that it only adds to the incredible 
complexity and confusion of Intel’s current 
product offerings. Right now, Intel lists 
no fewer than 144 individual mobile CPU 
models for sale from various generations 
of CPU. Just mobile CPUs, you’ll note, and 
all based on the full Core architecture. Of 
those 144 models, all are either dual-core 
or quad-core. The upshot is that much of 
Intel’s branding has become meaningless.
There are Core i5 mobile CPUs with 
two cores, for instance. There are Core i5 
mobile CPUs with four cores. But some of 
them have Hyper-Threading and support 
for eight threads. Others do not. Meanwhile, 
customers are expected to decipher an 
impenetrable product suffix, with anything 
up to four numerals and two letters. 
Frankly, if you set Intel the task of creating

What’s next?
Intel’s new 8th Gen family of CPUs 
is already pretty complicated, 
what with Kaby Lake refresh chips going 
into laptops, and the new Coffee Lake 
architecture for the desktop. But it’s only 
going to get busier.
So far, all the new 8th Generation 
processors are manufactured using 
Intel’s new 14nm++ silicon production 
process. It’s basically a refined version 
of the 14nm process that first appeared 
in 2014 with the Broadwell architecture. 
However, next year will see the arrival of 
Intel’s first 10nm processors, known as 
Cannon Lake. These, too, are expected to 
be marketed as 8th Generation CPUs.
Strictly speaking, Intel says it will be 
shipping the very first Cannon Lake CPUs 
by the end of 2017. But we doubt you’ll 
be able to buy PCs or the bare CPUs until 
early 2018 at best. Either way, Cannon 
Lake is essentially a die-shrink to 10nm 
of the new Coffee Lake architecture. Our 
expectation is that it will likely be limited 
to mobile CPU models. For the next step 
on the desktop, you’re talking Ice Lake.
Ice Lake is a CPU architecture that 
Intel has only recently confirmed to 
exist. It’s a new architecture that will 
be manufactured with what by then 
will be Intel’s revised 10nm+ transistors. 
Intel’s says it’s the successor to the 8th 
Generation Core family and thus will be 
the first official 9th Generation chip.
For now, that’s pretty much all that’s 
known about Ice Lake. Given that Intel’s 
CPU core design has essentially flatlined 
of late, we’re not expecting any major 
changes there. Instead, it’s core count 
and the integrated graphics that offer the 
best opportunities for dramatic change. 
We’d like to see the core count increase 
again and, in an ideal world, see Intel 
ditch the pointless integrated graphics on 
Core i5 and i7 models in return for either 
lower prices or more cores.
a product lineup expressly designed to beat 
customers into submission with the sheer, 
unfathomable complexity of it all, it could 
scarcely be any different from the array of 
similar mobile CPU models it does offer.
Despite all that, the new chips are still 
very welcome. They shift a whole class of 
notebooks instantly from dual to quad-core 
processing. Another 8th Gen novelty first 
seen with these U Series mobile chips is the 
debut of new branding for Intel’s integrated 
graphics. Gone is the old “HD” moniker; 
in comes “UHD.” The branding change 
reflects an increased emphasis on 4K or 
UHD resolutions. To achieve that, the new 
chips now natively support UHD resolutions 
via HDCP 2.2 content encryption and 
DisplayPort 1.2a connectivity. However, 
beyond those 2D video upgrades, the 3D 
graphics architecture is unchanged. That’s 
significant. But hold that thought while 
we segue deftly to the desktop and the 
CPUs that arguably best define this new 
generation of chips. We give you Coffee 
Lake, the family of CPUs that we’d argue is 
the true 8th Generation Core architecture.
Once 
again, 
it’s 
based 
on 
14nm 
technology. And once again, Intel is claiming 
further revisions and advancements for its 
14nm transistors. This time around, Intel is 
calling it 14nm++ and making some fairly 
bold claims. Overall, Intel says 14nm++ 
allows for around 24 percent higher drive 
current for 52 percent less power than 
its original 14nm process. What hasn’t 
seemingly changed is much by way of 
architectural improvements. Intel isn’t 
making big claims for things such as per-
core performance. Nor has it added to the 
16 native PCI Express lanes connecting the 
CPU to peripherals, such as graphics.
Instead, the really big news with Coffee 
Lake desktop chips is that they introduce the 
first increase in core count for mainstream 
Intel desktop processors since the Nehalem 
architecture of nearly a decade ago. Where 
once you got two cores, you now get four. 
And where you got four cores, you’ll now be 
getting six. And you’ll nearly, but not quite, 
get all that for the same money as before.
Intel has initially launched six CPUs, two 
each for Core i3, i5, and i7. The Core i3 models 
now offer four cores, while the Core i5 and 
Core i7 now pack six. If you’re wondering 
how the latter are differentiated, it’s via 
Hyper-Threading. Only the Core i7 models 
get that, so only the Core i7s are 12-thread 
chips. For the record, the Core i3s don’t get 
Hyper-Threading. Nor, incidentally, do they 
have the Turbo frequency boost mode. You 
get the base clock, and that’s it.
The exception to that is the unlocked “K” 
model in the Core i3 range, which is fully 
overclockable via the CPU multiplier. In 
fact, there’s an unlocked model of all three 
versions. What’s more, Intel has improved 
the overclockability of the K series models 
with more granular per-core overclocking. 
What it hasn’t done, unfortunately, is ditch 
the cheapo thermal interface material (or 
thermal paste) that connects the CPU die 
to the processor lid. Soldering the lid to the 
die would be better for performance and 
overclocking, but also that little bit more 
expensive to manufacture.
Regards pricing, the two Core i3 chips 
and the entry-level Core i5 and Core i7 
The basic Core i3 now has four cores, Core i5 chips are now six-core beasts, while Core i7 
models now have six cores and Hyper-Threading.
It’s the same CPU package, but you’ll still 
need a new motherboard.

are all the same price as their 7th Gen 
progenitors, while the top Core i5 and i7 
processors are a little more expensive. 
The other major change involves clock 
speeds. Peak Turbo speeds have gone 
up for the Core i5 and Core i7 chips, while 
base clocks are down across the board. 
But the base clock doesn’t tell the whole 
story. For example, Intel rates the new six-
core Core i5-8400 at 2.8GHz base clock. 
That sounds disappointing, even if it is only 
200MHz below the 3GHz base clock of the 
earlier quad-core Core i5-7400. In practice, 
however, we found the 8400 runs at 3.8GHz 
under load across all six cores. That’s just 
200MHz off its top 4GHz Turbo speed.
That aligns with Intel’s rating for the 
8400 with all six cores loaded. You can refer 
to our table for the details, but thanks to the 
added cores, it’s more important than ever 
to consider how fast each chip will run with 
all its cores under heavy load. That said, 
even the slowest of the new CPUs hits at 
least 3.6GHz with all cores loaded, while 
the top Core i7-8700K is rated at 4.3GHz 
with all six cores number crunching. In 
other words, Intel really is giving us the best 
of both worlds with these new processors. 
We’re getting more cores, and clock speeds 
have only fallen off by a very small amount.
Less impressive, depending on how 
you look at it, are the integrated graphics 
pick a  
platform
With a new generation of Intel 
processors usually comes a new 
platform. Intel’s 8th Gen Core chips are no 
different, even if it’s too early to assume 
which members of the 8th Gen family the 
new motherboard chipset will align with.
For now, it’s the six new desktop 
processors that are the first to be based 
on the Coffee Lake architecture. The new 
chipset they’re getting is the Z370. Indeed, 
the Z370 is more a requirement than a gift. 
Officially, the new Coffee Lake CPUs will 
not run in older motherboards.
In some ways, that’s frustrating. In most 
regards, the new Z370 is identical to the old 
Z270. It has the same broad connectivity, 
so we’re talking up to 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, six 
SATA 6Gb/s ports, with support for RAID 
0/1/5/10, a total of 14 USB ports, with up 
to 10 in USB 3.0 spec (yup, still no native 
support for USB 3.1 Gen 2), and support for 
Intel’s Optane memory as a boot drive. In 
fact, our understanding is that it’s the same 
chipset, just under a new name.
The difference—or rather the reason, 
according to Intel, for requiring a new 
chipset and therefore preventing drop-in 
upgrades of older boards with the new 
Coffee Lake processors—comes down 
to power consumption. The new six-core 
models are said to guzzle more juice than 
the old 200 Series mobos can handle.
That’s the theory. In practice, it seems 
as though it might just turn out that some 
high-spec Z270 motherboards could end 
up supporting Coffee Lake. According to 
Asus, some Z270 boards have sufficient 
power delivery to support Coffee Lake 
processors. All that would be needed are 
updates to the Management Engine and 
BIOS. However, this is something that 
Intel would have to enable. Motherboard 
makers would not be able to make that 
move unilaterally.
capabilities we alluded to earlier. Beyond 
the change in branding, there’s little to 
report. Intel hasn’t revised its 3D graphics 
architecture for Coffee Lake. The “new” 
UHD 630 graphics found in the new CPUs is 
the same in 3D rendering terms as the HD 
630 in the 7th Generation Kaby Lake chips.
Is this an indication that Intel is finally 
giving up on integrated graphics for what 
you might call serious gaming? That’s 
hard to say. What is for sure is that Intel’s 
integrated graphics have never been any 
good for serious gaming, and even fall 
short for casual gaming with older games. 
There’s a strong case for arguing these 
relatively high performance chips would 
be better off without the on-die graphics 
taking up any space at all. The Core i5 and i7 
models, in particular, will almost certainly 
be paired with discrete graphics cards.
With that in mind, Intel could either make 
the six-core die smaller and cheaper by 
removing the graphics, then pass the cost 
savings on to consumers, or add more 
cores and create an arguably more logical 
and appealing CPU range, with four cores at 
the bottom on the i3 models, six cores for 
i5 chips, and eight cores for i7s. It wouldn’t 
surprise us to see a hierarchy something 
like that in future generations.
While we’re talking graphics, there’s 
the question of gaming performance. For 
No new process node. No new architecture. But you do get more cores.
“For now, the number of games 
that make good use of more 
than four CPU cores registers 
between slim and none.”

as long as we can remember, true 
multithreaded gaming has been just around 
the corner. It’s a bit like cold fusion power, 
AI, or a cure for cancer. It’s always just over 
the horizon, but never seems to get closer. 
Admittedly, with the arrival of new 
graphics APIs in the form of DirectX 12 
and Vulkan, you could argue that the long-
promised multithreaded future for gaming 
is now tangibly closer. And that may be 
Now with six cores, but also that pesky integrated graphics.
true, but for now, the number of games that 
really make good use of more than four CPU 
cores registers somewhere between slim 
and none. With that in mind, what to make 
of the extra cores in Coffee Lake CPUs? For 
our money, it’s good news however you slice 
it. If you’re a many-cores denier, and you 
think four cores are plenty for gaming, the 
new chips get you a proper quad-core Intel 
desktop processor for just $117. If, like us, 
you think that six cores are a solid future-
proofing bet, that’s now a mainstream 
option from Intel.
Of course, while we’re patting Intel 
on the back for finally delivering some 
more mainstream processor cores on the 
desktop, it’s only fair to give its main—
and, frankly, only—rival AMD the last 
word in all this. It’s easy to imagine Intel’s 
new-found largesse failing to materialize 
had it not been for the sudden uptick in 
competition provided by AMD’s exciting new 
Ryzen processors.
With up to eight proper CPU cores in 
its own mainstream CPU socket, Ryzen 
packs a serious multithreaded punch. It’s 
also much more competitive in terms of 
single-threaded throughput than AMD 
chips of late. So, while it’s true to say that 
Intel almost certainly would have increased 
the core count of its CPUs of its own accord 
eventually, it’s unlikely to be a coincidence 
that it’s happening just when AMD upped 
its game. Indeed, the argument that Intel’s 
moves of late have been a direct reaction 
to increased competition from AMD only 
looks more convincing when you consider 
the spectacular decision to increase the 
core count of its enthusiast-class desktop 
processors from 8 to 18 in a single 
generation. There’s no way Intel would have 
done that without the AMD resurgence.

When it comes to netWorking, wireless is 
often synonymous with poor performance. 
Although it’s commonly seen by the general 
public as “the future,” you’ll rarely find a device 
that can provide you with as much performance 
as that trusty old Cat 5 cable trailing between 
your router and your rig. In reality, Wi-Fi is quite 
the archaic technology. 
So, with that in mind, why on earth would 
you invest in an aftermarket router like Asus’s 
RT-AC5300? Because it alleviates all of these 
problems and more. Its quad-cored, 1GB RAM 
internal system powers a tri-band router 
design, packing two 5GHz wireless frequency 
bands, and a single 2.4GHz one. Combine that 
with its extensive eight Gigabit LAN ports, one 
USB 3.0 port, one USB 2.0 port, support for 
link aggregation, and extensive multi-level 
AiProtection security, and it soon becomes 
apparent just how much of a beast this is.
All that aside, it’s the design that’s most 
striking. Featuring eight integrated antennas—
four transmitting and four receiving—the 
AC5300’s signal stability and range are 
exceptional. But is it worth the near-$400 price 
tag? Well, if you have a smart device connected 
family, it just might make sense to invest in this 
space crab-style piece of gear. –Zak storey

processors, or, in the case of touchscreen 
devices, an unintuitive user interface.
So the desktop endures, looking much 
the same as it did in the days of the 80286, 
only rotated 90 degrees into tower cases, 
and with more fans and lights, and a 
whopping great water block. Will it still be 
purring away on our desks in another 20 
years, though? 
One future route is already happening 
with the advent of cloud computing. Our 
PCs could become dumb terminals, akin 
to the thin clients of old, tapping into the 
huge processing and storage potential of 
data centers using high-speed wireless 
connections. 
They 
could 
all 
become 
touchscreen devices, small enough to tuck 
away in our pockets, then unfolding to 
gigantic size like some Tony Stark creation. 
They could be implanted into us, like 
something out of Iain M Banks’s Culture 
novels or an episode of Black Mirror, 
connecting us to a central hub, and with a 
display like that of a smartphone constantly 
projected into our vision.
Or maybe they’ll just stay the same, 
doubling in power every two years, and 
needing a new GPU even sooner. We went 
looking for answers.
UP Close and Personal
The term “PC” has evolved from meaning 
any type of personal computer to specifically 
those involving X86 processors and running 
Windows. Elsewhere, X86 + Unix = either 
Mac or Linux, ARM + Unix = iOS or Android, 
and ARM + Windows = discontinued. But 
those ARM chips are what’s got Samsung 
poised to overtake Intel as the world’s 
biggest processor manufacturer, and isn’t 
the smartphone in your pocket as much of a 
personal computer as the one on your desk?
Many 
developments 
in 
future 
PC 
components are extensions of things 
we’re 
already 
familiar 
with: 
greater 
efficiency, 
using 
less 
power, 
and 
increased parallelism. A Ryzen 1800X 
may have eight cores, but a GTX 1080 
Ti has 3,585. Yet while AMD’s silicon is 
general-purpose, Nvidia’s is specialized 
for graphics computations. Bringing this 
kind of parallel computing power to the 
mainstream, via something such as Nvidia’s 
CUDA, Microsoft’s DirectCompute, or other 
GPGPU programing languages, is a step 
in the direction of what’s predicted for the 
immediate future of our PCs. Then there’s 
3D chips, such as those seen in Xpoint or 
the vertical stacks of AMD’s HBM—these 
are about more efficient use of space, as 
well as, in the case of Xpoint, making use 
of a new approach to operating a memory 
chip. These technologies are here now, 
even if they’re not widely available. Future 
technologies will take these innovations, 
and turn up the volume.
Looking ahead, by 2035 we should have 
cracked 
thermodynamically 
reversible 
computing—that is, logical operations that 
can be run backward from their result, 
because nothing is destroyed in their 
operation, and they don’t increase entropy. 
This sounds a bit crazy—and is really only 
the tip of a whole iceberg of crazy—so 
we spoke to Professor Robin Hanson of 
George Mason University in Virginia, who is 
also a research associate at the Future of 
Humanity Institute of Oxford University in 
the UK, in an attempt to understand.
“When we run an engine, entropy is 
increasing,” he says, prompting a trip to 
Google immediately. Entropy, it seems, 
is the amount of energy in a system that’s 
wasted, unavailable to do work. The 
professor continues: “But if we want to 
reduce how much entropy increases, the 
slower we make the engine go, and the 
closer we can come to what’s called a 
reversible process, where you could 
have made it go backward and got back 
to the original state. That’s also true for 
computers: Almost all logic gate operations 
take two bits in and they send one bit out, 
therefore implicitly erasing one bit, and 
increasing entropy. Typically, we’re erasing 
far more than one bit per gate operation, but 
that number has been declining over time.”
This is where the year 2035 comes 
in—if you plot the number of bits erased 
by transistor operations on a graph, and 
continue the line into the future, it’s a 
mere 18 years until it reaches one. “At that 
point,” Prof Hanson continues, “we could 
keep reducing it, but we’ll have to switch 
to reversible computing, where we have 
two bits in and two bits out, with nothing 
erased. Once we switch to reversible gates 
and reversible computers, then we can 
continue to reduce the amount of entropy 
per gate operation, but it will be because 
we run the gate more slowly. If you take the 
same gate, but take twice the time to do the 
gate operation, then it erases half as many 
bits. So when hardware gets cheaper, and 
energy gets cheaper, you will spend half of 
it on having more hardware, and half of it on 
running things more slowly.”
So what we are looking at are lots of 
slow, parallel processors, rather than the 
small groups of screamingly fast cores we 
see today. But that’s not all: It will change 
the upgrade cycles, and what we budget for. 
“At that point, the rate at which technology 
improves, or hardware costs go down, 
is half as fast as it has been so far,” says 
Prof Hanson. “Up until recently, energy 
hasn’t really been the main cost—that’s 
been the hardware itself. And so, every 
time the hardware is capable of running 
twice as fast, the computers are twice as 
fast. But with reversible computing, every 
time the hardware gets four times as fast, 
instead of running the computers four times 
faster, we will instead have twice as many 
of them running at half the speed. This 
“The Tunnel 
FET looks like a 
MOSFET, and you 
can build a lot of 
the same circuitry 
with them.”

A Tunnel FET can operate on about half the 
power of a traditional MOSFET transistor.

Quantum Computing
the theory of quantum computing has been understood for a 
while now. Instead of using traditional transistor gates that 
can be in one of two states, 1 or 0, a quantum bit or “qubit” can 
be both at the same time, neither, or any combination. This 
hugely speeds up processing for certain calculations.
It comes at a cost, though: cooling. One method of building a 
quantum computer involves superconductors, and they need 
to be very cold—just above absolute zero. A water block isn’t 
going to cut it. The cooling system is about the size of a hot 
water cylinder, even though the processor is less than an inch 
across. Then there’s the “trapped ion” approach. This uses laser 
beams to trap and measure ions, which can be induced to carry 
out calculations thanks to quantum entanglement. This needs 
less cooling, but the machines can still be very large.
According to one researcher we spoke to on the subject, an 
interpretation of how quantum computing works is that it 
means Moore’s law will slow down by a 
factor of two.”
Moore’s law, which predicts a doubling 
of computing capacity over a period of two 
years, is already starting to break down in 
areas such as the speed of gate operations, 
but holds strong in the amount of energy 
used per operation. Many scientists are 
looking at ways to improve the rate of speed 
increase, and decrease the energy usage, 
through the use of new materials in chip 
design, and by changing the design of the 
transistors themselves. IBM researchers 
in the US are attempting to press 
nanotechnology, such as carbon nanotubes, 
into service, while in Switzerland, Big Blue 
is testing out other naturally occurring 
elements, known as III-V materials.
BaCk to sChool
Picture the periodic table thumbtacked 
to the wall of your chemistry class in high 
school. Silicon sits in the fourth column, 
with columns III and V to either side. Many 
elements from both sides, when made into 
compounds, form very stable chemical 
bonds, and are semiconductors, like silicon, 
which means that although, in their natural 
state, they don’t allow electricity to flow 
through them, they can be “doped” with 
another element to allow it, and this can 
be done in a controllable way. A lot of this 
is still exploratory science, but you may 
already own a piece of technology based on 
this idea—the laser diodes inside Blu-ray 
drives are made from gallium nitride—and 
makes use of computations across parallel universes. By doing 
this, it can solve certain problems in maybe just a few hours 
that even the fastest supercomputer in the world today would 
take billions of years to calculate. 
Which sounds fantastic, but there are, inevitably, some 
problems. One is the sheer size, which we can expect to come 
down as the technology matures, and another is that, for 
the uses that you and your mom have for computers, there’s 
simply no benefit in using a quantum model. The algorithm 
being processed needs to be specifically written to take 
advantage of the processor. So, while you’ll probably never 
check Facebook, edit video, or play a game on a quantum 
computer, you may very well interact with an AI running on 
one. And the technically minded can use a five-qubit quantum 
computer today at http://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/

another projeCt coming out of IBM’s Zurich labs will be 
of interest to anyone who’s ever filled up a water-cooling 
reservoir and worried about spillage. Electronic blood is a fluid 
that circulates through the microchips themselves, drawing 
away heat, while at the same time providing power. In another 
example of hardware/wetware convergence, this is much the 
same way our brains work.
Using it means a change in the design of chips, so they 
contain microchannels that the “blood” can pass through to 
achieve laminar flow—an orderly, low-speed movement of the 
liquid in parallel layers, without any eddies or turbulence 
forming. It could change the underside of a chip, too—more of 
the 1,000-odd pins on the backside of a CPU are dedicated to 
power delivery than are for data flow. IBM is using 3D printing 
to produce its tiny cooling networks cheaply. Perhaps the 
biggest change this could bring to PCs, however, would be 
in density. At the moment, we need large surface areas for 
contact with heat spreaders or active coolers. With the cooling 
fluid moving across inner surfaces, we could stack chips like 
a five-patty burger, and let the sauce—or maybe the cheese—
take care of heat and power. This would cut down on the 
amount of good fresh air inside our PC cases, as well as using 
only a single pump, reducing noise levels in the process.
The fluid itself is made from chemicals with names like 
dihydroxyanthraquinone, and by acting as an electrolyte, and 
being charged as it passes electrodes, it’s capable of supplying 
one watt of power, once pumping overheads are subtracted. 
This doesn’t sound much in these days of 1,000W PSUs, but 
it’s enough to power microprocessors, and the LEDs and lasers 
used in fiber-optic networks.
eleCtroniC blood
hopefully more should come to fruition 
before 2035.
“The speed at which you can turn on 
a MOSFET is inherently limited,” says Dr 
Kirsten Moselund from IBM Research. This 
is the breakdown in Moore’s law mentioned 
above—the 
MOSFET, 
or 
metal 
oxide 
semiconductor field effect transistor, is the 
type of transistor most commonly used in a 
silicon chip, first patented back in 1925. “It 
doesn’t matter what you make it out of, it’s 
a physical limitation,” she continues. “As 
we scale down our devices, we also want 
to scale down voltages, but it’s very hard to 
scale down power beyond 60mV—you start 
to get into trouble. There are lots of people 
looking into this, because it’s beyond all 
the technical difficulties of scaling, it’s 
something physical. And scaling down the 
voltages is probably the most important 
parameter for energy efficiency.”
The search for a way around this has led 
Dr Moselund and her team to Tunnel FETs, 
a type of transistor that exploits the ability 
of electrons to tunnel through a barrier if 
that barrier is thin enough. This is quantum 
mechanics in action, making use of a 
strange property of electrons—that they 
can be either waves or particles. 
“The Tunnel FET looks like a MOSFET, 
and you can build a lot of the same circuitry 
with them,” says Dr Moselund. “But as it 
operates on a different principle, in theory 
you don’t have the same limitations.” 
Indeed, a Tunnel FET can operate on only 
about half the power of a MOSFET—in 
simulations, at least. These transistors 
are made from, you guessed it, those III-V 
materials—indium arsenide and gallium 
antimonide are common choices. “III-Vs 
have a lot of really nice benefits,” Moselund 
continues. “There are lots of them, and 
they have different properties, but what’s 
generally good about them is many have 
very high electron mobilities [how quickly an 
electron, and therefore a current, can move 
through them], so you can trade speed for 
lower power, and many are optically active,

one argument that can be drawn out of 
Hanson’s work is whether these brain 
emulations would be conscious. after all, 
if the Ems do all the work, and humans 
retire and live on the profits, isn’t there a 
word for that? as in star Wars, where an 
army of apparently sentient droids obeys 
and are the property of the biological 
creatures, would we be condemning them 
to a nightmare of our own making?
the question of whether computers 
will be conscious may never be answered. 
Hanson asserts there’s no way to tell: “If we 
mean it in the informal descriptive sense, 
of having some sense of self like humans 
do, that you can ask questions like ‘what 
did you do yesterday?’ or ‘how did you feel 
about that?’ then most computers are like 
that. and we could create computers that 
are more like that. 
“If you mean there’s something about 
a human that feels in addition to how 
it behaves, what it remembers, and its 
coherent story of itself, and these feelings 
are not reducible to plans, memories, or 
calculations, but are something else that’s 
a part of us that’s not included in the 
computery parts of ourselves, that there’s 
some extra part of humans beyond the 
physical, we’ll never really know about 
what causes it or where it comes from. 
“You’ll probably never really know if 
anybody you meet ever feels; the left side of 
your brain never knows whether the right 
side of your brain feels, and the you of today 
can never really know if the you of the 
past or the future really feels. all you know 
about these things comes through physical 
channels. and if people still think these 
questions make sense in the age of Ems, 
they will still disagree about it then.”
a matter 
 of ethiCS
so you can make lasers out of them, which 
you can’t do with silicon.”
Lasers are obviously great, but modern 
electronic devices have another problem—
they leak. This is why they get hot and drain 
their batteries when you’re not using them. 
The gates in the transistors don’t shut 
completely, allowing small amounts of 
power to trickle through like a leaky faucet. 
Tunnel FETs and III-V materials have a 
greater ability to turn themselves off all the 
way, decreasing leakage and power loss. 
The new materials don’t completely 
replace existing ones; they’re integrated 
into the silicon in a way that boosts its 
electron mobility, to increase performance 
at 7nm and smaller, meaning existing 
manufacturing processes can still be 
used. IBM, GlobalFoundries, and Samsung 
debuted a silicon wafer etched with a 5nm 
process earlier this year. The III-V materials 
are grown as crystals on a silicon substrate, 
then a process known as “epitaxy” deposits 
more material on top, forming structures 
such as nanowires and junctions, and even 
stacking them on top of one another. You 
can also mix up the recipe—what Moselund 
calls “tuning”—blending, say, 50 percent 
arsenic with 20 percent gallium and 30 
percent indium, with a specific use in mind.
It’s not just the structure of microchips 
that will change; the way computers are 
put together and treated is also in for a 
revolution. Professor Hanson believes that 
computers will one day be able to simulate 
and go far beyond the capabilities of the 
human brain. He calls these emulations 
“Ems,” and his concept is not a little thought-
provoking: When computing is advanced 
enough, it will out-compete humanity.
“A natural result is that humans will 
have to retire,” says Hanson. “They’re just 
not competitive. They could still work, 
they just can’t earn much money that way. 
Collectively, humans get very rich very fast, 
that is, they own almost all the capital in this 
world, and if the economy doubles almost 
every month, human wealth doubles every 
month. For individual humans who don’t 
own any wealth, that zero keeps doubling to 
zero, and those people are at risk of starving 
Professor Robin Hanson of George Mason 
University in Virginia.
unless they acquire some insurance, 
assets, or sharing arrangements. But 
collectively humans get very rich very fast. 
em PoWer
“The Ems, however, they do not get rich,” 
he says. “Their population quickly expands 
and wages stay at subsistence levels, but 
they are mostly OK with that—subsistence 
wages have been the usual case in human 
history. They’re earning enough to pay the 
power bill, the cooling bill, the hardware 
rental, the communication line bill... which 
will presumably come in one big package.” 
This is treading rather closer to 
philosophy and economic theory than we’re 
used to, so in an attempt to drag it back to 
more familiar terms of reference, we ask 
Hanson whether he thinks there’s a future 
for the desktop PC. And he does. Kind of.
“A lot of people will continue to do office 
work at desks—it’s kind of comfortable 
to sit in a chair,” he says. “And they will 
want something around them to act as the 
interface to the computer they work with. 
Now, whether the computer is just sitting 
on the wall, or in their hands, or on the 
desk, that’s much harder to say. They could 
have a box next to them or a server down 
the hall—it hardly matters from the point of 
view of them interacting with the computer. 
I like to use the same computer at home 
and in the office, so I prefer a laptop, but 
the incentive to use a laptop will get less the 
more reliable cloud services get.”
Hanson goes on to imagine cities that 
glow red hot because they’re occupied by the 
hardware and cooling needed to run Ems, 
with humans banished to more habitable 
parts of the globe, but the inference is 
clear—in the near term, PCs will continue 
to get more powerful, integrating new 
materials and structures into their designs. 
But as the cloud gets more important and 
reliable, and communication links get 
faster, a transition to something like today’s 
supercomputer model could occur, with 
virtual computers held in the cloud, and 
eventually virtual workers there, too. It’s 
safe for now, but the days of the desktop PC 
could ultimately be numbered. Sorry. 
Nvidia’s Xavier SOC uses 512 GPU and 8 CPU 
cores to be the brain of an autonomous car.
Also from Nvidia, the Tesla GPU introduces 
additional parallelism for AI use, and more.

It’s probably no surprise to learn 
that I’m the youngest Maximum PC 
team member. I recently dinged to 
level 26, and had quite the moment of 
realization when looking back at my 
two decades of system tinkering. 
In my youth, I gamed a lot—some 
might say excessively—but as I’ve 
matured, I’ve found it more and more 
difficult to find AAA titles that hold my 
attention. Although it’s still easy for 
me to drop into games and become 
more than proficient, my patience and 
free time is far more limited. I tend to 
find myself browsing the web, working, 
consuming media, and planning my 
next big adventure far more than 
investing in a new RPG or RTS. 
Back in March, I fell in love with 
Samsung’s CF791 super-wide screen. 
Its dramatic 21:9 aspect ratio, crisp 
pixel density, and 100Hz refresh 
persuaded me to take the plunge and 
purchase the $750 screen, under the 
premise that it was perfect for gaming.
But I’m starting to wonder whether 
it was the right choice. Don’t get 
me wrong, I still play games in my 
downtime, but high refresh rates, 
variable sync, and dramatic ratios 
aren’t as important as my brain likes to 
think. The screen is perfect, but I’m not 
sure it’s perfect for my circumstances. 
The answer? I think it’s time I sold 
the Korean beauty to another PC 
enthusiast, and invested in a 40-inch-
plus 4K behemoth instead. Combined 
with a re-evaluation and rebuild of my 
custom desk at home to something a 
little more professional (system and 
all), I might be on to a winner.
Setting HigH RefReSH RateS
120Hz refresh rate screens are beautiful to behold, so make 
sure you don’t miss out on one of the best features available 
for display technology (if your screen supports it). Right-click 
your desktop, select “Display settings,” then scroll down, and 
click the “Display adapter properties” link. Click the “Monitor” 
tab in the top of the new window. Go down to “Screen refresh 
rate,” and select the refresh rate you want to use (higher is 
better). Hit “Apply,” and the job’s done.

BACKGROUND
Google revolutionizes the smartphone market with the Pixel 2 
XL, offering new squeezability. We’re hoping a teardown will 
reveal just how huggable it is. Follow along as we plumb the 
depths of Google’s latest, greatest (and biggest) handset! 
MAJOR TECH SPECS
•  6-inch plastic OLED (POLED) display with QHD+ 1440x2880 
resolution (538ppi) and 3D Gorilla Glass 5
•  Octa-core, 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor 
(2.35GHz + 1.9GHz) with 4GB LPDDR4x RAM
•  12.2MP, f/1.8 main camera, with dual-pixel phase detection 
autofocus and laser detection autofocus; 8MP selfie camera
•  64GB or 128GB built-in storage
•  Pixel Imprint back-mounted fingerprint sensor
•  IP67 water and dust resistant
•  Android 8.0 Oreo
KEY FINDINGS
•  The Pixel 2 XL is a waterproof smartphone, which means all 
the ingress points must be sealed. We find our first evidence 
of Google’s efforts in a gasket on the SIM tray. In a departure 
from standard smartphone opening procedure, we leave the 
iOpener behind. The Pixel 2 employs foam tape that can be 
separated without heat. Inside are long cables—a welcome 
respite from treacherous openings with past smartphones. 
•  We have to untether the display before going further. Its two 
cables are secured by plastic plugs in the midframe, and they 
only come out with some encouragement from a hefty pry 
tool. As in the original Pixel XL, a magnesium midframe 
separates the display from the innards, and provides a 
solid backing behind the display. Piggybacking on to that 
midframe, we find a brand new heat pipe. Looks like this 
phone might run a bit hotter than its previous incarnation. 
•  Last year, the HTC-built Pixel XL showed us a novel way to 
remove an adhered battery—a perforated outer label let you 
pull the battery out of its shell, then easily peel off the rest of 
the label. This year, it seems LG’s industrial design doesn’t 
include any provision for easy battery removal. 
•  We peel back some copper tape to unleash the XL’s beast of a 
main camera. Although the megapixel count on this camera 
is close to last year’s, the similarities between the sensors 
end there. This year, Google switched to a dual-pixel sensor, 
added optical image stabilization, and opened the aperture 
up to f/1.8 from last year’s f/2.0. 
•  Along with a few other connectors, all that’s holding the 
motherboard in place are the midframe screws. The 8MP 
front-facing camera pops free readily, and can rest easy, 
knowing it’s a full megapixel better than the latest iPhone 
offerings. With the meat of the Pixel pulled out, we just have 
a few case peripherals to attend to.
•  Repairability Score: 6 out of 10 (10 is the easiest to repair). 
Many components are modular and can be replaced once the 
display assembly is removed. All the screws are common 
Phillips #00 screws. The display is still thin and poorly 
supported, especially around the grilles, but foam adhesive 
makes the opening process easier. The battery’s loss of 
pull-tab adhesive, plus tightly walled-in placement, makes 
it harder to remove. The stubborn midframe and tight-fitting 
display cable mean more labor-intensive repairs.

Head over to www.aomeitech.com/pe-builder.html, where 
you’ll see a pair of links, for 146MB and 72MB downloads. 
The larger download contains AOMEI’s Partition Assistant and 
Backupper utilities, which will be incorporated into your rescue 
disc. These are key tools—Partition Assistant can recover lost 
and deleted partitions, for example, while Backupper can be used 
to take a full system image of your drive—so we recommend 
downloading the 146MB version.

follow the on-screen prompts to install the software. Once 
complete, launch it from the Start menu or via a search for “AOMEI.”

The opening screen provides a series of hyperlinks, 
explaining various aspects of the rescue disc’s interface, 
as well as included tools and utilities. Once you’ve reviewed these, 
click “Next.” By default, “Download WinPE creating environment

If WIndoWs faIls to boot, or you’re otherwise locked out of your system, what can you do? Built-
in recovery tools are certainly helpful, but they’re not the most user-friendly. Microsoft developed 
a special “pre-installation environment,” called Windows PE, which gives you access to a cut-down 
version of Windows that can be started from a bootable DVD or USB flash drive. It’s basic, but it 
contains a familiar, user-friendly graphical interface that gives you access to your system even 
when it won’t boot.
Creating this recovery media by hand can be tricky, but AOMEI PE Builder 2.0 doesn’t just simplify 
this process, it makes it possible for you to build your own customized recovery disc, complete with 
the tools you know and trust for recovering data, restoring a previous backup, researching the 
problem online, and even performing certain repairs to bring your ailing PC back to life.
In this tutorial, we’re going to show you how to build (and use) your own customized rescue media 
using PE Builder, which now runs on all flavors of Windows, from Windows XP up to the latest 
iteration of Windows 10. Without further ado—and while your PC is still working correctly—let’s 
jump on the recovery wagon. –Nick Peers

are two considerations. First, 64-bit boot media will work 
with both older BIOS and newer UEFI systems, while 32-
bit media only supports older legacy systems (see the 
troubleshooting box on page 62 for a possible workaround). 
Second, you need to source portable apps and drivers of 
the same system type as your rescue disc—32-bit apps are 
more common than 64-bit ones. Make your choice, then 
click “Next.”
3
customize portable apps
Expand the “File,” “Network,” and “System” 
sections to see what bonus tools are included 
with your rescue disc by default. Select one to read a 
description. In most cases, you’ll leave these all selected—
but we recommend deselecting the web browser QtWeb (it 
doesn’t work properly in 64-bit environments).
>> Click “Add Files” to add your own portable tools to 
the rescue disc—up to 2GB of programs can be added this 
way. It’s worth gathering these apps in their own folder, 
then adding each tool’s subfolder individually as shown 
[image b]—they’ll be accessible from the rescue disc’s 
desktop under the “UserTools” folder. See the box opposite 
for tips on tools to look for, but remember you can also run 
portable apps directly off other drives, so long as they’re 
detected by your rescue media, so don’t go overboard.

aDD custom DriVers
All the core drivers you need—graphics, keyboard, mouse, 
and wired network—should be covered by PE Builder, but 
there’s a chance that certain network (specifically Wi-Fi) and hard 
drive (storage controller or RAID) drivers aren’t present, while 
some advanced USB mice and keyboards aren’t recognized either. 
You’ll only discover this after you’ve created (and booted from) your 
rescue media.
>> If you discover missing drivers, you need to source the driver 
installation files yourself to add them to your recovery media 
from this screen. First, obtain the latest version of driver from 
the manufacturer—if you’re struggling to track it down, try www.
driverscape.com, where you can search a range of popular PC and 
laptop models, as well as hardware devices.
>> You need to be able to extract the contents of whatever driver 
file you download, so you can locate a .INF file, which is what PE 
Builder needs to build the driver from. Use a tool such as 7-Zip 
(www.7-zip.org) to do this—if the file is a setup.exe file, try “Open 
inside” to see if the driver files can be manually retrieved; if not, you 
need to look elsewhere for the drivers.

buIld a toolkIt
You can incorporate additional portable tools in your AOMEI 
rescue disc, giving you access to a wide range of additional 
apps and utilities. Just one golden rule: Your portable app 
must match the system type (32-bit or 64-bit) of your rescue 
disc. To determine this, first launch the app, then open Task 
Manager. Switch to the “Details” tab, right-click the column 
headers, and choose “Select columns.” Select “Platform,” 
and click “OK.” Locate your program, and you’ll see it’s listed 
as either 32-bit or 64-bit.
Start your search for portable tools at http://portableapps.
com, where you’ll find most bases are covered, particularly 
for 32-bit apps. Tools to grab from here include Autoruns 
(manage startup items), SSD-Z (check hard drive health), 
Teracopy (faster file transfers), FileZilla (FTP transfers), and 
PuTTY (SSH into other machines). Visit the programs’ home 
pages to source 64-bit versions.
We also recommend Opera (www.opera.com/computer/
portable) to replace QtWeb, data-recovery powerhouse DMDE 
(www.dmde.com—32-bit only for free version), dual-engine 
anti-malware tool Emsisoft Emergency Kit (www.emsisoft.
co.uk—run it from a separate drive) and O&O RegEditor (www.
oo-software.com) for editing your crashed PC’s Registry.

>> If you’re able to obtain the files and all-important .inf file, 
return to PE Builder, and click “Add Drivers” followed by “Add File” 
to locate and select the .inf file you identified [image c]. Click “OK” 
followed by “Next” when you’re done.
>> If you’re attempting to add drivers to your boot media, we 
suggest taking out an insurance policy by clicking “Add Files” 
again—this time, click “Add Folder,” and add the folder containing 
your extra drivers to your rescue media. This will enable you to 
attempt a manual installation of those drivers within the recovery 
environment, should they not automatically load with your rescue 
media. Once done, click “Next.”
5
choose boot meDia
Your rescue disc is now ready to be burned or copied. 
Select “Burn to CD/DVD” if you have a blank DVD inserted 
(we recommend rewritable media, because you may find your disc 
doesn’t work, or requires tweaking later). Alternatively, select “USB 
Boot Device” to choose a flash drive to build the recovery media 
on—note the drive is completely wiped by this process, so copy off 
any data you wish to keep from it first. If more than one USB drive 
is connected to your PC, verify you have the correct one selected 
by its drive letter. The “Export ISO file” option generates an ISO file 
you can burn or copy manually, or use in a virtual machine, such as 
VirtualBox. Click “Next” when you’ve made your choice. Read any 
warning [image D], then click “OK.”
6
create Disc
Wait while your recovery media is created—the 
first time you run the tool, PE Builder downloads 
a Windows 10 PE installation image, but the file is retained 
for future use, so subsequent builds should be quicker, 
unless you switch system type between 32-bit and 64-bit.  
Once the process is complete, click “Finish.” 
7
test meDia
Leave your bootable media inserted and reboot 
your PC to make sure it works. It may automatically 
be set to boot from your CD/DVD or USB drive, or you 
may need to look for an option to press a key—typically a 
function key—to select your boot device. Once selected, 
look for your CD/DVD or flash drive. If more than one option 
is supplied, try the UEFI option first; if that fails, try the 
USB option [image e]. If no option appears, or the disc or 
drive fails to boot, check out the troubleshooting box (left).
>> If successful, be patient—the loading process is much 
slower than via hard drive, particularly if you’ve added lots 
of tools and drivers to your rescue media. Eventually, you 
should find yourself at the rescue media’s desktop, with 
shortcuts to all the built-in tools. You’ll find the resolution 
is set to 1024x768, which makes it appeared squashed on 
widescreen displays. Sadly, this can’t be changed, but it 
should give you enough room to troubleshoot in.
8
test network connection
Check to see if you have Internet access through 
your rescue media. The caveat is that Windows PE 
only works by default with Ethernet interfaces. Double-
click the PENetwork icon to open PE Network Manager. 
If your Ethernet adapter has been detected, it should be 
listed. Click the “Info” button to see if it’s been allocated 
an IP address. If it appears to have one, open your portable 
web browser to verify your Internet connection works.
>> If not, click “Renew” if you connect through DHCP, 
or “Obtain an IP address automatically” to manually set a 
static IP address, subnet mask (255.255.255.0), and default 
gateway (the IP address of your router). Set the DNS server 
to your router’s IP address; if that fails, try 208.67.222.222.
F
E
If your rescue disc or drive doesn’t work as you expect it to during 
testing, check out these quick-fire fixes.
• 32-bit rescue media isn’t 
recognized: 32-bit media 
requires an older BIOS-based 
PC or a newer UEFI PC with 
Compatibility Mode enabled and 
Fast Boot disabled. Choose the 
USB option in the boot menu.
• Insufficient memory error: 
PE loads everything it has 
into memory—if you’ve not 
got enough RAM, rebuild your 
rescue media with fewer tools.
• Computer doesn’t boot from 
USB: Try burning a CD or DVD 
instead if your PC isn’t capable 
of booting from USB devices 
(only the very oldest PCs 
shouldn’t able to do this).
• Certain hardware doesn’t 
work: There’s no guarantee 
you’ll get your hardware to 
work, even if you track down 
drivers. We failed to get two 
Wi-Fi adapters working (one 
code 37 error, another driver 
unrecognized), and our third 
only worked when we manually 
installed the driver after booting.
• Program won’t run in recovery 
environment: Make sure it’s the 
same system type (32 or 64-bit) 
as your rescue media; also try 
running from a separate drive.
• I have another problem: See

connect through wi-fi
If you’re trying to connect via Wi-Fi, click the drop-down 
menu to see if your adapter has been detected; in the likely 
event it hasn’t, and you’ve manually added the driver folder to your 
rescue media (see step four), you can attempt to install it manually. 
Press Win-R, type “devmgmt.msc,” and hit “Enter.” Look for a 
reference to Wi-Fi or Network Controller under “Other devices.” 
Double-click this, then click “Update Driver.” Choose “Browse my 
computer for driver software.” Select the folder containing your 
drivers [image f], and see whether Windows is able to install them. 
>> If successful, go to PE Network Manager. Select “Force 
scanning for new devices on adapter list refresh,” switch to the “Wi-
Fi” tab, click “Start,” then “OK.” Reopen the tool, and your Wi-Fi 
adapter should appear under the device drop-down. Select it, then 
switch to the “Wi-Fi” tab to connect to your local network [image g].
10
a brief tour
Double-click the “This PC” shortcut in the top-left 
corner to access File Explorer. You should see all drives 
(internal and external) appear. If any are missing, you need to source 
appropriate drivers (typically “RAID” or “storage controller”—
consult your PC or motherboard’s support site for them) to add 
to your rescue media. You’ll notice a drive marked “X”—this is the 
drive Windows PE has installed itself to, and is a “virtual drive,” 
in that it’s stored in RAM. This is partly why it’s restricted to 2GB, 
to work on lower memory (and 32-bit) machines. Your other drives 
should be recognizable by their drive letters—though some may 
have swapped around, so browse each one for confirmation.
>> In case you ever find yourself using your rescue media to try 
to recover from a non-booting PC, now would be the time to work 
out which drive is your backup drive, then launch AOMEI Backupper 
from its desktop shortcut to take a full backup of your afflicted 
Windows system drive [image h]. This would enable you to then 
attempt repairs knowing your files are protected, should you be 
forced to perform a complete wipe and reinstall.

11
test your apps
Open the “UserTools” folder via its shortcut to test 
any apps you’ve added. Not all will work, even if they 
are the correct system type. Non-functioning apps usually 
exhibit no symptoms—you double-click the shortcut, but 
nothing happens, even after a wait (right-click the Taskbar 
and choose “Task Manager” to see if anything is present).
>> Some apps fail because they prefer to run from a 
physical drive—if you have a portable apps folder on 
another drive, try running them from there. There’s 
no rule—other than convenience—that forces you to 
incorporate your apps into your rescue media.
12
Quick-fire tips
There are no quick-and-easy repair tools built 
into the AOMEI rescue media—you may want 
to pair it with a Lazesoft Recovery Suite Home Edition 
recovery disc (www.lazesoft.com) to cover all bases. The 
PE environment is best used for backing up and recovering 
data, browsing the web to troubleshoot boot-related 
problems, and perform manual repairs. Built-in tools that 
can help include AOMEI Partition Assistant (recover lost 
or deleted partitions), BootICE (examine and repair boot 
entries), and Recuva (recover deleted files). You also have 
access to a limited set of system tools—press Win-R to 
launch Control Panel (control.exe—most links don’t work, 
however), Device Manager (devmgmt.msc), or Computer 
Management (comptmgmt.msc), among others [image i].
>> One major thing to remember is that you’re not directly 
plugged into your Windows installation. That means taking 
additional steps to connect to files and settings associated 
with your ailing Windows install.
>> For example, to view and edit your BCD file on an 
older PC, with a BIOS rather than UEFI, you need to direct 
BootICE to the system reserved partition’s Boot folder, and 
the Bcd file within. To manage your PC’s startup entries 
in Autoruns, choose “File > Analyze Offline System,” and 
point “System Root” to C:\Windows, and “User Profile” 
to C:\Users\<Username>. Finally, editing your Windows 
Registry using O&O RegEditor would require you to point 
the program at C:\Windows. Replace “C:” with whatever 
drive your Windows installation is on.
>> Any changes you make to any apps incorporated 
in your rescue media are lost when you reboot, so while 
you might want to synchronize your Opera profile with the 
portable app to access your favorites and add-ons, for 
example, you’d need to do so every time you booted from 
the rescue media. To get around this, use portable apps 
stored on another drive, where changes are recorded.

WolfenPi: 
FPS Action in WWII
1
ChoColate Wolfenstein
Apart from being both a showcase for the first-person shooter 
and shareware, Wolfenstein 3D was also notable in that its 
developer licensed the game engine to other companies. This 
resulted in the game being ported to various other platforms besides 
the original MS-DOS, such as Mac OS, the Acorn Archimedes, and 
SNES. In 1995, the source code for the Wolfenstein 3D game engine 
was released, which meant that fans were now free to create their 
own versions. 
>> In this guide, we’re focusing on running Fabien Sanglard’s 
formidable Chocolate Wolfenstein engine. This is a slightly improved 
version of the original “vanilla” engine, which is nevertheless 
designed to mimic the original game as closely as possible.
>> Although the engine itself is open source and can be compiled 
on your Pi, the game data files, which contain details of maps, levels, 
enemies, and so on, are still under copyright. For this reason, this 
guide focuses on running the shareware version of Wolfenstein 
Secret Agent Captain William “BJ” Joseph Blazkowicz’s commendable efforts to halt 
the Nazi war machine come to a crashing halt at the start of id Software’s Wolfenstein 3D. 
Having successfully thwarted an evil scientist’s plans to create a race of mutant-Nazi hybrids,  
BJ has been captured and consigned to the dungeons of the Nazi stronghold, Castle Wolfenstein. 
After quickly overpowering a hapless guard, you must now navigate BJ through the six episodes of 
the game, consisting of 10 levels each, shooting evil henchmen and dogs, while collecting looted 
treasure on the way.
While using Nazis as bad guys is nothing new, when Wolfenstein 3D was first released in 1992, 
even its developers couldn’t have known the staggering level of success it would enjoy. At its heart, 
the game is a first-person shooter, using 3D graphics in the style of Doom, which id Software would 
release a few years later. The game is notable for its use of ray casting, a technique whereby only 
surfaces closer to the player were calculated, resulting in much smoother gameplay. This, of 
course, was an issue much more relevant to users of early ’90s PCs, but it’s also important to your 
gaming experience on the Raspberry Pi. –Nate Drake

Any version should be OK, but a 
Raspberry Pi 3 is recommended 
for the best performance.

If you install the Steam version of 
Wolfenstein 3D for Windows, navigate 
to 
“C:\Program 
Files 
(x86)\Steam\
steamapps\common\Wolfenstein

base” and copy all nine files with the 
extension “.wl6” on to a USB stick, 
then insert it into your Pi. The files and 
extensions must all be in lower case 
to be compatible. Open Terminal, and 
navigate to the USB stick—for example,  
 cd /media/pi/usB1 . Convert the files to 
lower case with  for i in $(find . -type f 
-name “*[a-Z]*”); do mv “$i” “$(echo $i | 
tr a-Z a-z)”; done . Finally, move them to 
the correct folder with  mv *.wl6 /home/
pi/Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D .
Next, run the command  sudo nano /
home/pi/Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D/
version.h . This file determines which 
version of Wolfenstein to compile. Find 
the section marked “/* Defines used for 
different versions */” and make sure 
there’s a // at the start of every line in 
that section, except those containing the 
words “GOODTIMES” and “CARMACIZED.” 
Press Ctrl-X, then Y, then Return to save 
and exit. Follow the steps in the walkthrough 
on the right to compile the full version of 
Wolfenstein 3D. 
If you’ve purchased the prequel, Spear 
of Destiny, the data files are located in “C:\
Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\
common\Spear of Destiny\base” and 
have the extension .SOD. Change these 
to lower case and move them into the 
“Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D” folder as 
outlined above. Run  sudo nano /home/pi/
Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D/version.h  and 
make sure there’s a // at the start of each

“Escape from Castle Wolfenstein” [image a]. This still gives you 10 
levels of high-octane, chaingun-smoking action, but if you want to 
play the full version, you can purchase the game, and copy the data 
files over to your Pi if you wish. The Chocolate Wolfenstein engine 
also supports playing the prequel to Wolfenstein 3D, called Spear 
of Destiny (see the boxout, below-left).

pRep youR pi 
Although, technically, you can compile and run Chocolate 
Wolfenstein on any model of Pi, we recommend using a 
Raspberry Pi 3 for best performance. The tutorial assumes you 
have a clean installation of Raspbian on your SD card, and that you 
have run  sudo apt-get update  and  sudo apt-get upgrade  before 
going any further.
3
attention to Detail 
Because the Chocolate Wolfenstein engine only requires 
you to run the  make  command, and place the data files 
in the same folder as the executable, there’s very little that 
can go awry with this project. Data files for different iterations 
of Wolfenstein games have different extensions, such as the 
shareware version of Wolfenstein 3D (.wl1), the full version  
(.wl6), and Spear of Destiny (.sod). If you see an error message when 
trying to launch the game, saying it can’t find the right data files, 
the most likely reason is because all data filenames and extensions 
must be in lower case—this process is initially done in the boxout 
on the left. 
>> The Chocolate Wolfenstein 3D engine also has to be compiled 
differently, depending on the version of the game that you’re using. 
You can change this in the “version.h” file in the game directory. 
4
Game options
If you don’t know how to get the data files for the full version 
of the game, consider buying the Steam Windows version 
of Wolfenstein 3D [image b], which is available for $5. See the 
boxout on the left for help with finding the data files for installation. 
Steam also sells a Windows version of Spear of Destiny for $3. Non-
Windows users may be able to find a second-hand version of the 
game CD online.
>> If you enjoy the premise of gunning down Axis troops but aren’t 
happy with the clunky graphics, you’ll be pleased to know that the 
game spawned the free and open-source Linux game Wolfenstein: 
Enemy 
Territory 
(www.splashdamage.com/content/download-
wolfenstein-enemy-territory). The game gives you the choice of 
fighting on the side of either the Axis or Allied powers, playing as 
part of a multiplayer team with your friends.

Edit Your Images 
in Luminar
1
Get set
As we write, you can get the beta version of Luminar from 
https://macphun.com, but that will change as soon as the 
developer presses the big green “Go!” button, and launches the 
app. Once it’s up and running, you’re offered the choice of working 
on your own pictures or on a sample image. The sample shots are 
very good, and provide a playground in which to try out all aspects 
of the app, but there’s nothing like editing your own work, especially 
with the trees giving such a fine display of fall color.
2
Play with your Picture
Open an image using the folder icon to the top-left of the 
interface, and after a little processing, you’ll see previews 
of your image in all the presets along the bottom of the app. Clicking 
the “Infinity” button to the extreme-right opens up the categories 
of preset, so you can narrow down your search for a good look. We 
Not every image-editiNg app has to be by Adobe, and sometimes something comes along from 
an unexpected source that’s genuinely interesting, and trying to do something new. 
One such program is Luminar, from Macphun. The clue is in the developer’s name—this app has 
been available on fruit-based computers for a while now, and as was the case with Affinity Photo, 
this means the minimalist architects and latte-drinkers have done the beta testing for us. At the 
time of writing, Luminar is available for free download as a Windows beta, but by the time you read 
this guide, it may be available as a full release—the launch date is currently down as the rather 
nebulous “fall 2017.”
Luminar isn’t Photoshop; it’s more a collection of one-shot fixes and presets, but it has the ability 
to alter these effects, and layer them on top of one another, to build up sophisticated results, with a 
before and after slider so you can see precisely what you’ve changed. –Ian EvEndEn

discover there’s one called “Colors of the Fall,” so apply 
it to our image, and click the divided rectangle icon at the 
top-middle of the window to enable a before and after view 
[image a] that can be dragged back and forth to show the 
effect the adjustment has. The eye button next to it returns 
your image to its unaltered state for as long as it’s held 
down, and there are zoom and full-screen controls to the 
left of the eye.

With a preset selected, a column of adjustments 
appears on the right, so you can tweak the 
parameters of its effects. They’re worth experimenting 
with, so you can get a handle on what they all do—Luminar 
offers non-destructive image editing, so no changes are 
final until you export your work as a new image. There are 
A

R&D

also many ways to undo your work, with a “Reset” button appearing 
above (or below) every slider in the right-hand column, a big single-
click “Undo” arrow at the top of the interface, and a clock icon next 
to it that drops down a “History” menu [image B], so you can go back 
to a particular stage in your workflow and restart from there.
4
roll your own
One of the more interesting presets is the “Auto Smart 
Enhancer,” which analyzes your image to decide how best 
to enhance its tones and contrast [image c]. It’s not worth buying an 
app like this just to use it as a one-click-fix machine, however, but it 
does provide a good starting point for you to take control and adjust 
the image manually. Seeing how the ASE has manipulated the 
sliders in the right-hand column gives you a good idea of how they 
work, and you can push some of them further or pull them back to 
create something more in keeping with your own preferences. You 
can then save your settings as a new custom preset, so you can 
come back to them when working on subsequent images.
5
iconoclasts
Luminar’s layers are one of its strongest features, enabling 
you to place separate effects on top of one another, and 
then fade the top one out, so they blend together. The “Layers” 
palette can be accessed from the icon, top-right, which looks like 
two overlapping squares, if it’s not visible already—one of the 
weaknesses of Luminar’s interface is the way icons are spaced 
out along the top bar, and the lack of explanatory tooltips when you 
B
C
hover your pointer over them. Hopefully, this can be fixed 
in the final release. 
6
layers and masks
In addition to layers, you can use masks to apply 
an effect to only certain areas of an image. 
Luminar has rectangular and circular gradient masks, 
and a paintbrush tool that enables you to paint your chosen 
preset or filter on to your image. This is especially useful 
when combined with layers, because you can have one 
set of presets applied to the base layer, with another set 
painted on to an upper layer, completely changing the look 
of the parts it affects [image d].
7
croP and Go
When you’ve finished with your editing, there are 
two steps you can take. There’s a crop tool hidden 
away on the extreme-right, looking like a pair of scissors. 
Use this to trim away the edges of your image to change its 
center point or aspect ratio—you can use it to rotate, too, 
if you’ve got a tilted horizon, or other lines that should be 
straighter. Then there’s the “Export” button, at the top-left, 
looking like a square with an arrow pointing out of it. This 
enables you to save your work as a file locally, and also 
share straight to social media or email. You’re not given a 
huge choice of formats to export to, but a straightforward 
JPEG is usually all you need. 
D
Filters—different from presets, in that they do one 
thing only—can be accessed by popping out the menu 
at the top of the “Filters” stack on the right, using the 
“+” button. You get an explanation of what each one 
does, which is an improvement over the presets, as 
you don’t have to guess what they do based on the 
thumbnails at the bottom. If you want more space 
for your image, this thumbnail bar can be turned

Mid-Range AMD
Gaming Rig
We have a bad habit of focusing too much 
on the high end, and not enough on what 
really matters. Say what you like, but the 
halo products aren’t what make or break 
a company. And although manufacturers 
make their biggest margins on the most 
expensive components, it’s the mid-range 
and budget sections of the spectrum that 
secure the most market share. Which is 
why, more often than not, they’re the more 
interesting products. Ask any of our team 
which processor interested them the most 
over the last two years, and the answer 
almost always falls down to either the 
Pentium G4560 or the Ryzen 3 1200.
Anyone can spec out a high-end, pixel-
crushing, calculation-solving monster. But 
it takes a true master to get the most out of 
a tighter budget. Every dollar counts—far 
more so than with the inefficient price-hiked 
parts of the high-end machines. And that’s 
what we wanted to look at this time around. 
The concept was simple: Take a $1,100 
budget, pick mid-range components, and 
come out with a solid, fun, and fast 1080p 
gaming machine, using AMD parts for the 
GPU and CPU.
The Ryzen 3 1300X was the base for this 
build. After numerous high-priced systems, 
it was nice to get a little more down to earth 
with a budget part, a stock cooler, and some 
neat money-saving ideas, without losing out 
on the speed we associate with systems that 
can cost twice the price of this one.

We’ve been iTChing To Try out this case for a while. Phanteks’ 
P300 case is an astonishing achievement of budget-busting 
ingenuity. Featuring tempered glass, RGB LEDs, a sophisticated 
internal chassis design, PSU cover, dust filters, room for 280mm 
AIOs, and extensive storage support, this beautifully crafted 
case comes in at just $64. Honestly, it’s almost impossible for 
us to recommend any other chassis at this price point right now. 
Regardless of your budget, it’s simply too good.
As we said, we decided to go with the Ryzen 3 1300X as our 
base; a quad-core part, with enough grunt to pump through AAA 
titles with ease, especially at that 60fps sweet spot. On top of 
that, we added Gigabyte’s Aorus Radeon RX 570 refresh. With 
higher clock speeds and 4GB of VRAM, it’ll make quick work of 
any of our 1080p titles, and look pretty flashy while doing it. Its 
compact size also helps with the build, because it doesn’t look as 
though we’ll run into any clearance issues with it.
Amazingly, under full load, this system should draw an 
estimated 326W from the wall at most, so we opted for a non-
modular 500W Bronze PSU from Corsair. Although we don’t 
intend to overclock our Ryzen chip, having the extra headroom is 
useful in case we change our minds later down the line, and also 
helps if we ever decide to upgrade to a beefier GPU.
For storage, we stuck with that old staple of the modern 
system: a 120GB SSD for the OS and a 1TB-plus (in our case, 2TB) 
HDD for everything else. Samsung’s 120GB 750 Evo comes in at 
a reasonable $78, and provides a perfect platform for this build, 
while the WD Black is more than enough for our gaming needs.
We don’T say This often enough: For most new builds, 
to save time and effort, it’s best to test most of your 
components outside the case. A good way to do this is 
to build your system on top of the box the motherboard 
came in. The cardboard box acts as an anti-static test 
bench, and by testing it outside the chassis, if you have a 
problem with the motherboard, CPU, or anything else, 
you can quickly resolve the issue with the supplier, 
without having to rip everything out of your system. 
Word of warning: Do not place your motherboard or 
GPU on top of the anti-static bags they came in, because 
the outside of the bags actually conducts electricity.
The nexT sTep for any build is to strip the case down 
as far as you can, removing all the side panels, the 
roof, and the front covers if possible. In the P300’s 
case, once you do this, you gain access to the hard 
drive cages, because they pull out from the front of 
the chassis. Make sure you install the hard drives with 
the connectors facing backward—toward your power 
supply—and you shouldn’t have too much of an issue. 
Some hard drives may not fit in the stock caddies, 
so you might need to get inventive with the toolless 
mounting (we had to remove the two clips, and secure 
ours with screws).

There’s no gliTz and glam on the included stock cooler 
this time around, and the mounting is arguably far less 
frustrating than on AMD’s RGB LED editions. Simply unscrew 
the two mounting brackets on the motherboard, leave the 
stock motherboard backplate in, and secure the cooler in a star 
pattern with the pre-mounted screws, until you reach the end of 
the thread—job done. We tied our fan cable into a little loop, to 
reduce its length and help keep the build looking tidy.
oUr only CriTiCism of this chassis is the cutbacks 
Phanteks had to make when it came to the materials used 
in its construction. They make sense—after all, to hit such 
a phenomenally low price point, and still make a profit, 
compromises have to be made. In this case, the metal finish 
is prone to fingermarks, as is the glass panel. That said, it’s 
nothing a quick wipe with a microfiber cloth can’t fix, and 
as that’s our only gripe with this case, we’ll let Phanteks off 
the hook this time.

We kneW From The sTarT that our non-modular PSU was 
going to cause a few problems. For this build, we installed 
the PSU, identified how many cables we were going to 
need, then grouped the remaining ones together, and tied 
them into little bundles using cable ties, enabling us to 
tuck them out of the way. Phanteks has also included some 
of its signature Velcro cable straps in the P300, so you can 
route your cables however you like, and adjust on the fly, to 
make sure you can secure that rear side panel.
FronT i/o Cables are always going to be a nightmare—
fortunately, Gigabyte includes a neat little cradle, where you 
can preload the cables, then plug the cradle directly into the 
front I/O connection point, making it easier. We also had to run 
our front USB 3.0 header down at the bottom of the board here, 
which proved quite challenging, bending the cable round just 
enough to mount it. We had little choice on this one, however, 
because the motherboard itself lacks any USB 3.0 headers near 
the traditional 24-pin ATX position.

you could run an m.2 ssd beneath 
the gpU, but to avoid thermal 
throttling, you’re better off with the  
2.5-inch in the back.
This is one classy machine. It just goes 
to show how far chassis development has 
come—the internal layout enables you to keep 
budget boxes so much tidier nowadays. 
All in all, it was a painless build. The only real 
issue we had was with the hard drive caddy. 
Why the mounting slots don’t match the holes 
in WD’s 2TB Black 3.5-inch drives is beyond 
us. We got around this, though, by removing 
the two toolless clips from the caddy, then 
securing the hard drive in place with screws 
instead. It was also tricky to install the cables. 
We actually slid it out the front, installed the 
cables through the case, then slid it back into 
the hard drive cage. Having the extra wiggle 
room outside the chassis made it easier.
We had a slight issue when installing the 
motherboard, and it was nothing to do with 
forgetting the rear I/O shield either. Whether 
it was a cost-cutting measure in the P300, 
or the B350-Gaming 3’s budget sizing, there 
were no cut-outs to support the extreme 
right-hand edge of the motherboard. So, if you 
weren’t careful, you could accidentally flex the 
PCB when installing the 24-pin ATX power. To 
get around this, when installing the big juice, 
we placed two fingers underneath the edge 
of the board, before pushing the 24-pin into 
place. Interestingly, the P300 supports E-ATX 
boards, but only up to 275mm—impressive 
nonetheless, and an oddity in a $60 chassis.
On to the nitty gritty: performance. It isn’t 
a bad rig at all. The Ryzen 3 1300X is a potent 
chip for the price. Desktop performance 
is smooth as butter, combined with 16GB 
of DDR4, and that zippy 750 Evo is quick, 
too, and doesn’t bottleneck when running 
multiple applications. Now, we’re not saying 
you can have 15 Chrome tabs open, VoIP, two 
games, and screen recording on the go, but 
for everyday usage, office work, or more, it 
hits the spot perfectly. In game, it holds itself 
steady, hitting 54fps in The Division at 1080p, 
and 30fps in Rise of the Tomb Raider, at the 
nastiest of settings. The RX 570 isn’t the most 
cost-effective card currently available, we 
have to admit—and as cryptominers continue 
to snap up any AMD-branded card, that’s 
unlikely to change anytime soon—but it’s no 
slouch either. Perfect for 1080p gaming. 
The upgrade path for this rig is fairly sound. 
A more powerful processor would be a treat, 
or to save a bit of dollar, you could invest in 
the cooling, and overclock the 1300X. Higher 
frequency memory makes a huge difference 
to Ryzen’s performance, too—a 3,200MT/s kit 
would easily add 10–15 percent to processing 
output. Of course, the obvious hit for gamers 
right now is that Nvidia is far more cost-
effective than the AMD alternative. It’s a good 
rig, for sure, we just wish AMD’s VGA division 
was a little more competitive.

When Coffee Lake first launched, it’s fair 
to say we were fairly apprehensive of the 
azure juggernaut’s response to Ryzen. 
After all, it came out of the blue. Kaby Lake 
officially launched in January 2017, and a 
meager nine months later, we gained its 
hex-cored successor. And there was a big 
problem: thermals. At first glance, Coffee 
Lake’s six-core flagship seemed nothing 
more than a hot-headed retort, an attempt 
to regain the lost ground Ryzen had 
claimed. Although impressive, with both 
price and performance being perfectly on 
point, skyrocketing past its predecessors, 
its thermal dynamics really put us off. 
Our launch sample came with an Asus 
Maximus X Hero motherboard, almost 
identical to the one we received with the 
Ryzen launch. No cause for concern there. 
However, temps were through the roof, 
reading 70–80 C at stock under load, with 
a 280mm AIO chilling the six-cored critter. 
At first, we chalked this up to the thermal 
paste between the die and the IHS still 
being the same poor quality crud used 
since the launch of Ivy Bridge, back in 2012.
But once we began to dig below the 
surface, it soon became apparent that this 
wasn’t the case. There was an issue with 
voltage. Even with the latest BIOS installed, 
the Maximus X Hero’s VCore was fluctuating 
between 1.3 and 1.4V. Now, by default, your 
standard Sky Lake chip ate its way through 
Coffee Lake perfection

Best scores are in bold. Our test bed consists of an Intel Core i7-8700K, 16GB (2x 8GB) of Corsair Dominator 
Platinum DDR4 3200, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, and a 500GB Samsung 850 Evo SSD. Far Cry Primal tested 
at Ultra at 4K.
1.2V at stock, yet it was possible to easily get 
it running, stable, at 1.12V with little issue, 
reducing load temperatures by around 10 
degrees in the process. However, synthetic 
and real-world benchmark scores were 
high on the Maximus, and the architectural 
design effective, so we put it down to a 
generational quirk, with the additional 
cores simply requiring more juice.
Godspeed
In comes the MSI Z370 Godlike Gaming. 
Our second Z370 board on test, and the 
difference couldn’t be more dramatic. At 
stock, there’s just a small disparity (less 
than 5 percent) between our benchmark 
scores, both in synthetic and real-
world tests. And that alludes to how this 
motherboard applies its VCore voltage. In 
other words, it does it right. At stock, we 
noticed a maximum 1.1V being pumped 
into the VCore, with very little in the way 
of V-Droop. At 1.3V, we even managed a 
concrete 5GHz across all cores, bumping 
those figures up comfortably to Ryzen 7 
1800X levels of performance, but at a far 
lower cost with regard to temps.
That, however, is beside the point. This 
is a $500 motherboard—and, boy, can you 
tell. It is absolutely packed to the brim with 
practically every feature MSI could fit on a 
board. Its E-ATX bulk houses support for 
three M.2 PCIe SSDs on the board itself, 
with an additional two via an add-in card. It 
features triple Gigabit Ethernet ports, with 
5GHz Wireless A/C. For connectivity, you’re 
gifted with 7x USB 3.1 Type A ports, one USB 
3.1 Type C port, and a combi port. Then, of 
course, we get to the audio. And, damn, is it 
juicy. Featuring an ESS Audio DAC, with its 
own dedicated amplifier, hi-fi grade WIMA 
capacitors, and dual (both front and rear) 
HD audio processors, the Godlike sounds 
stunning. It even has separate isolated 
PCB layers, unique to each left and right 
channel. Couple that with gold-plated 5.1 
audio, optical out, and a full-size 0.25-inch 
headphone jack, and it’s enough to satisfy 
any audiophile.
The Godlike Gaming is a true testament 
to exactly what you can fit on the Z370 
chipset. Its impressive design, clean 
aesthetics, 
dependable 
audio, 
and 
appropriate performance make it one of 
the best motherboards we’ve ever seen 
from MSI. And if this is any indication of 
how the rest of MSI’s lineup performs 
this generation, call us impressed. This is 
Coffee Lake done properly. –Zak Storey

It’s taken the better part of a decade, but 
Intel has finally upped the core count of its 
mainstream PC processors. Give it up for 
the new Coffee Lake chips!
As we’ve explained elsewhere, the big 
news with the Coffee Lake generation is the 
jump from two cores and four cores to four 
cores and six cores. In other words, where 
once you got two cores, now you have four. 
And where you had four, you now get six. 
This new Core i5-8400 replaces the quad-
core Core i5-7400. So, it’s a six-core beast. 
Like previous Core i5 models, it doesn’t 
support HyperThreading, so that’s six 
cores and just six threads. Also somewhat 
similar to before is the price. Intel lists the 
Core i5-8400 at $182; however, they’re 
currently retailing for $200, meaning 
50 percent more cores for almost the same 
money. Nice.
What’s more, you don’t lose out much 
by way of clock speeds, either. OK, the 
base clock has dropped from 3GHz to 
2.8GHz, but the top Turbo frequency 
is actually up fairly dramatically, from 
3.5GHz to 4GHz. What’s more, the L3 cache 
memory pool has grown from 6MB to 9MB. 
What you don’t get, however, is a great 
deal by way of additional architectural 
enhancements. Intel hasn’t made much 
noise about improvements to the CPU 
cores themselves, for instance. The new 
Coffee Lake chips are also still made with 
14nm transistors, just like other Intel 
processors dating back to the Broadwell 
generation in 2014, though Intel does state 
More cores. Less cash. What’s not to like?

Best scores are in bold. Our test bed consists of an Asus Z370 Maximus X Hero, 16GB (2x 8GB) of Corsair 
Dominator Platinum DDR4, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, and a Samsung 850 Evo 500GB SSD. All games were 
tested at 1440p on the highest graphical profile. 
that Coffee Lake benefits from a revised 
production node known as “14nm+.”
Similarly, the integrated graphics core 
is essentially carried over. It now runs at 
1.05GHz peak instead of 1GHz. And it has 
better support for outputting at 4K. But 
as a gaming proposition, Intel’s integrated 
graphics core seems to be stalling. It was 
never very convincing, of course, but it now 
looks entirely redundant. Better to remove 
it from the chip altogether and lower the 
price, or replace it with more CPU cores 
perhaps. After all, how many customers 
are going to run the likes of this new Core 
i5-8400 on integrated as opposed to even a 
low-end discrete GPU? Very few, we wager.
Platform games
Anyway, the final major factor to consider 
before we dive into performance involves 
platform support. If anything, this is the 
big disappointment with the new Coffee 
Lake chips. For starters, you need a new 
motherboard, despite Coffee Lake being 
pin-compatible with Sky Lake. Intel says 
that’s because the new chips require 
more power. Sadly, however, the new Z370 
chipset appears to be a rebadge of the old 
Z270, with no new features. Likewise, the 
new chips don’t have additional PCI Express 
lanes in and out of the CPU die compared 
with their Sky Lake progenitors. Pity.
What isn’t disappointing is performance. 
As we’d expected from the detailed 
specifications, the 8400 clocks up to 3.8GHz 
with all six cores under heavy load. So, 
you’re getting a really nice combination 
of core count and operating frequency, 
especially considering the modest price 
point. That’s just as well, given this is not a 
“K” series model, so overclocking is not an 
option. But remember, these are proper, 
modern Intel CPU cores. In fact, they’re 
the best cores in the business—better 
even than AMD’s impressive new Ryzen 
cores. From a multithreading perspective, 
it absolutely blows away previous Core i5 
models, and it’s close enough in terms of 
single-threaded performance that you’d 
never feel the difference. 
Of course, where the old Core i5 really 
scored was as a gaming a CPU. Arguably, 
there are relatively few current games 
that really scale well beyond four cores. 
However, as more and more games appear 
that make the most of the multithreading 
capabilities of the new DX12 and Vulkan 
APIs, that could well change. With this 
fantastic six-core Core i5, you’re ready to 
cash in if and when that happens. In the 
meantime, you’ve got a great all-around 
CPU at a surprisingly affordable price. We 
like. We like a lot. –Jeremy LaIrd

You can give a car fancy European 
styling, but what’s the point if it’s plain old 
Detroit iron underneath, and a pushrod 
motor under the hood? That’s the kind 
of conundrum posed by ADATA’s newest 
SSD. Well, kinda. ADATA has dressed up 
its latest PCI Express SSD in enthusiast-
friendly threads. It’s given it “gamer” 
branding, yet this is not a high-end drive. 
It’s an entry-level SSD in the M.2 category. 
We give you the new ADATA XPG Gammix 
S10, test-driven here in 512GB spec.
For the record, the Gammix has the 
same components and specs as ADATA’s 
own bare-bones drive, the SX7000. Only 
the snazzy heat spreader separates the 
two. Either way, you get 512GB of Micron 
32-layer 3D TLC NAND memory arranged 
in 384Gb chips, marshaled by a Silicon 
Motion SM2260 controller, and hooked 
up to the system via four PCI Express 
3.0 links. Sustained throughput is rated 
at 1,750MB/s for reads and 850MB/s for 
writes, while IOPS are 140K and 130K. 
Of course, not all of us speak fluent 
SSD. So let’s put those numbers into 
context. Arguably, the gold standard in 
the M.2 segment is Samsung’s 960 Pro. On 
paper, the 512GB variant gives this ADATA 
drive a pretty comprehensive hammering.

it’s whole multiples faster. What’s more, 
ADATA itself offers faster M.2 options.
On the other hand, ADATA matches 
Samsung’s five-year warranty. It’s also 
a bit cheaper than the 960 Pro. But this 
is where the Gammix’s problems begin. 
On current pricing, it’s only $10 cheaper. 
Worse, the very similar ADATA SX7000 
512GB can be had for just $188. That’s over 
$90 cheaper. To put it another way, it’s $90 
for the heat spreader. The SX7000 even has 
the same five-year cover as the Gammix.
Data Delivery
That all reflects the vagaries of product 
cycles. As a new entrant, the Gammix’s 
price has yet to find its comfort zone. In the 
meantime, it’s hard to make an argument 
for this drive as an on-paper proposition. 
It’s equally hard when you factor in its 
actual performance. In terms of sequential 
throughput, it delivers on the theoretical 
spec in some tests. Meanwhile, 4K random 
access performance is tolerable for this 
class of drive, rather than spectacular. 
As a frame of reference, even in mere 
250GB spec, Samsung’s mainstream 960 
Evo M.2 drive beats the Gammix in every 
synthetic metric, bar 4K random writes. 
Perhaps even more of an issue is the real-
world feel of the drive. When it comes to 
sustained data writing, it’s one of those 
drives that seemingly cycle up and down 
in performance. It gives the impression of 
a controller chipset inefficiently using the 
RAM cache as a write buffer, enabling the 
drive to momentarily achieve high speeds 
before the RAM is filled and then transfers 
its data to the NAND cells. As for how 
much impact the heat spreader has, it’s 
hard to be sure. But if we had to put money 
on it, our bet would be pretty much none. 
Whatever way you look at it, the Gammix 
doesn’t have terribly consistent real-world 
performance when writing large data sets.
The flip side is subjective performance 
that’s still very zippy. It’s a lot quicker than 
a SATA SSD by most measures. For day-
to-day computing, you’re never going to 
feel the difference between the Gammix 
and even the fastest alternative drives. So, 
all ADATA really needs to do is tweak the 
price to match the performance, rather 
than the Gammix’s misleading enthusiast 
aesthetics. Until then, there are better 
options at this price point from the likes of 
Samsung, or equally good alternatives for 
far less from ADATA itself. –JeremY Laird

MSI’s first mainstream triple-
fan card is no slouch.

MAXIMUMPC

JAN 2018

When choosing which GPUs to review, 
there’s a simple process of elimination we 
go through. Typically, we review a reference 
card on launch, then, if it’s interesting 
enough, one aftermarket variant, and 
generally that’s it. To cover more than 
that, it has to be exceptional in one way or 
another. MSI’s Trio is one such card.
Admittedly, this isn’t the first tri-cooler 
we’ve seen from MSI, although that three-
fan design has usually been reserved 
for the two-and-a-half-slot, high-end, 
Lightning overclocking variants, which 
aren’t readily available, and often come at 
such a high price point it’s enough to make 
even the mighty Titan Xp sweat.
So, what’s so interesting? Think of this 
as MSI’s equivalent to Asus’s DCIII. Or a Tri 
Frozr cooling solution, instead of its usual 
Twin Frozr. Now, let’s be clear, the Twin 
Frozr is still a solid and dependable cooling 
choice, capable of keeping even the GTX 
1080 below 70 C under load in some of the 
most airflow-restricted cases out there—
so why the big push for the triple fan? Well, 
the general public is under the impression 
that the more fans you have, the cooler you 
can keep it, and although that is somewhat 
true, nothing in our eyes trumps good 
heatsink design, something at which MSI 
has always excelled.
That aside, the Gaming X variants 
are now looking to be available to the

Best scores are in bold. Our test bed consists of an Intel Core i7-7700K, 16GB of Corsair DDR4 @ 2400,  
an Asus Maximus IX Hero, and a 500GB Samsung 850 Evo SSD. All games are tested at their highest  
graphical profile, with AA turned up, at 1440p.
mainstream at a far more affordable price, 
and coupled with the GTX 1080 Ti GPU at 
its core, this is a prime outing for the new 
cooler. Packed with a fully custom PCB, 
designed from the ground up for improved 
power delivery, and the inclusion of RGB 
lighting, it’s easy to see why MSI chose 
the GTX 1080 Ti as its base for the Trio’s 
first outing. We’d be surprised if the next 
generation of cards didn’t come with Trios 
as standard, across everything from the 
GTX 2060 upward.
So, how good is it? And how much of a 
difference does that custom PCB make? 
Well, it all comes down to memory and 
GPU core clock speeds. In brief, with the 
help of GPU Boost, the MSI Gaming X Trio’s 
stock performance was exceptional in our 
testing, and far closer to the Titan Xps we 
featured in our Dream Machine 2017 build 
than we’d like to admit. 
At 1440p, we saw average frame rates as 
high as 106 in Far Cry Primal, 63 in Rise of 
the Tomb Raider, and 57 in Total War: Attila. 
In comparison, the Titan Xp at stock scores 
average frame rates of 107 in Primal, 64 
in Rise, and 58 in Total War: Attila—that’s 
a one-frame-per-second difference, for a 
card that costs $400 more.
It’s cool, too. Seriously so. While 
overclocking and running stress tests, we 
achieved a maximum temperature of 58 C. 
Impressive enough, even at stock, but we 
weren’t anywhere near that, pumping an 
extra 120MHz into the core and 270MHz 
into the already overclocked memory.
MSI has really hit it out of the park with 
this one. The Gaming X Trio is an impressive 
redesign of an already impressive card, 
with incredible stock performance and 
cooling. It’s a heavy beast for sure, even 
coming with its own reinforcing bracket in 
the box, but the trade-offs are few and, to 
be frank, it’s one of the best GTX 1080 Tis 
we’ve seen. The big questions lie with the 
following: Can you stomach the $80 price 
hike for the additional performance, on top 
of MSI’s own and currently most affordable 
GTX 1080 Ti ARMOR edition? And do you 
mind the slightly off-putting RGB LED 
lighting design? If the answers are yes and 
no respectively, the Trio is likely the best 
GTX 1080 Ti for you. –Zak storey

Eurocom is known for its customizable 
portable workstations, but every system 
we’ve tested so far has been, well, let’s just 
say bulky, and leave it at that. Things are 
different this time, as we’ve got Eurocom’s 
Q5 in for testing—another svelte laptop 
built on the foundation of Nvidia’s Max-Q 
philosophy. Spec for spec, the Q5 is very 
similar to MSI’s GS63VR Stealth Pro 
that we tested last month, so our big 
question this time around is how much 
bearing does different manufacturers’ 
interpretation of the Max-Q philosophy 
have on performance, power, and design. 
In other words, who did it better?
That’s a tough question to answer. The 
Q5 starts at a lower price point—only 
$1,599 for a stripped-down system of Core 
i7-7700HQ, 8GB RAM, GTX 1070 Max-Q—
but quickly balloons in price once you start 
going for complete parity with the GS63VR. 
So, let’s talk about the configuration we 
tested: $2,499 for a beefed-up spec that 
includes a super-fast Samsung 960 Pro 
SSD, 16GB DDR4-2666, and a 120Hz screen.
The 960 Pro is an outstanding inclusion, 
but also the priciest. Its blistering-fast 
CrystalDiskMark results (not to mention 
near-non-existent game load times) really 
show the difference between Samsung’s 
performance M.2 line and the slower (but 
still excellent) 850 Evo. Having said that, it’s

Our laptop zero-point is the MSI GS63VR Stealth Pro-078, with an Intel Core i7-7700HQ, 8GB GTX 1070 Max-Q, and 
16GB of DDR4. All game tests are performed at 1080p, at the highest graphical profile.
hard to justify dropping several hundred 
dollars for something like load times, 
when the cost could be put toward in-
game performance. Of course, Eurocom’s 
systems are customizable, so it’s easy to 
pick the storage spec that fits your needs.
This brings us to the screen, one of our 
larger disappointments. The Q5’s base spec 
features a fairly standard 60Hz IPS panel, 
but our unit featured a 120Hz panel, putting 
it in line with the GS63VR. While neither 
featured G-Sync support—an unfortunate 
exclusion—the Q5’s 120Hz option is of the 
TN variety. Colors appear washed out, 
despite professional calibration. There’s 
also a 4K IPS option, but again, only 60Hz, 
and the Max-Q GTX 1070 GPU would have 
a tough time performing at that resolution.
Speaking 
of 
the 
GPU, 
let’s 
talk 
benchmarks. In our gaming tests, the Q5 
performed more or less in line with the 
GS63VR: 56fps in Total War: Warhammer II, 
and 43fps in Ghost Recon: Wildlands—
almost identical to the GS63VR’s scores. 
In Rise of the Tomb Raider, however, the 
Q5 took the lead by nearly 20fps—89 to the 
GS63VR’s 71. 3DMark Fire Strike similarly 
returned a slightly higher score: 11,957 for 
the Q5 versus 11,338 on the GS63VR. 
Unfortunately, these higher scores were 
not without drawbacks. Namely: heat. 
Temperature control was always the biggest 
question mark of the Max-Q design, and it 
seems that Eurocom’s efforts on that front 
don’t do much to assuage our worry. The 
Q5 got extremely hot during benchmarking 
and regular gameplay: We measured 43 C 
in the WASD area of the keyboard, 49 C on 
the keyboard near the center, where the 
CPU and GPU are located, around 54 C 
on the metal above the keyboard, and as 
hot as 62 C on the underside, where the 
processors are located. For comparison, 
the GS63VR measured 54 C at its hottest, 
and that was the air being spat out of the 
vents. Temperatures on the chassis itself 
remained much cooler. 
So, who’s the winner? Hard to say. For 
customizability and top-end performance, 
the Q5 gives you a lot more to work with, 
but you have to deal with the price tag that 
comes along with it. The GS63VR Stealth 
Pro offers a complete package that’s hard 
to say no to. Either way, both systems beat 
the hell out of a Mac. –Bo moorE

For as long as humankind has been able to 
pass an electrical current through a circuit 
board, we’ve been singing the praises of 
Kingston’s HyperX Cloud headset in its 
various forms. It began with QPad’s QH-90  
in 2013, taking its cues from aviation 
headset design, and setting a new high bar 
for closed-cup gaming sound. Kingston 
bought the rights to that design and 
iterated on it with the Cloud and Cloud II, 
which didn’t reinvent the wheel but did find 
sonic improvements, and introduced new 
features. What can the Cloud Alpha do to 
make good on its prestigious name, then?
Even better sound. Duh. What’s more 
interesting than that non-revelation is how 
the Alpha does it: using separate chambers 
within each earcup for bass, mid, and 
high frequencies, giving each the room to 
resonate individually without distorting. 
In truth, many high-end gaming headsets, 
and 
headphones 
aimed 
outside 
the 
gaming space, adopt this principle, but the 
execution of it here yields audible benefits. 
The frequency response on offer here 
is absurd: 13Hz–27kHz, one of the widest 
we’ve ever tested in a gaming product. 
While you won’t be able to magically hear 
below 20Hz, no matter how diligently 
you’ve worn foam earplugs at death metal 
shows, the increased headroom (and, um, 
cellar space?) above and below the audible 
20Hz–20kHz range does matter. In that 
extra space are subharmonic frequencies 
that enrich the audible frequencies. In  
hi-fi salesman terms, that equates to extra 
“low-end power” and “sparkle.” 
Elsewhere, 
it’s 
a 
case 
of 
the 
fundamentals done right. Comfort has 
long been a strength of the Cloud series—
as you might guess from its name—and 
the Alpha is just as much of a pleasure to 
wear, despite gaining an extra ounce in 
weight over the Cloud II, probably due to 
the new chamber design. Comfort levels 
are noticeably improved over the Cloud II, 
but it’s nice to see an already high standard

maintained in this new model, particularly 
as it sticks at the $100 price point. 
We’re glad to see that the cable is now 
detachable. After years of service, our 
Cloud II passed over to that great recycling 
plant in the sky when its cable died. But 
with this model, a broken cable connection 
wouldn’t mean the death of the whole 
headset. It’s business as usual for the mic: 
detachable, covered in a generous memory 
foam pop guard, and offering decent noise-
canceling. Apparently, this was a focus for 
Kingston when designing the Alpha, to the 
extent that it tuned the mic specifically to 
cancel the frequencies that Cherry MX 
mechanical switches produce, but to our 
ears, the result is about the same—still 
short of Sennheiser’s amazing quality, but 
better than most. The inline control sees a 
redesign, but we’re less impressed by its 
underwhelming plastic construction than 
the rest of the package. The double-sided 
volume scroll wheel is handy, but the mic 
mute switch is a bit sticky, and without a 
clip to keep it close by, it can get lost when 
your eyes are locked screen-ward.
If you’re still using a pair of Cloud IIs, 
you have no reason to panic about the 
advent of a new model. The improvements 
are small; significant enough that those 
without a decent headset have a more 
persuasive argument from Kingston than 
ever to invest, but not enough that the 
Cloud II is now obsolete. This isn’t an alpha 
that tries to neg you, or grunts obnoxiously 
after every deadlift at the gym, but 
nonetheless, it does exert its dominance 
at the $100 price point, and should thus be 
considered the go-to headset for anyone in 
need of an upgrade. –Phil iwaniuk

You’re a logical reader. You’ve seen the 
headline up there, you’re asking one-word 
questions such as “what” and “why,” and 
frankly you are completely justified. On 
the face of it, Logitech has gone absolutely 
mad with power. The company’s engineers 
(who have, it must be said, been on fire 
recently) realized that they could create 
a 4K webcam without stopping to think if 
they should. Then its marketers slapped 
the word “stream” on it, despite the fact 
that rendering and uploading a stable 
4K stream is beyond most PCs, Internet 
connections, and streaming hosts. And 
then its power-crazed number-crunchers 
decided $199 was a perfectly reasonable 
price for such a thing. All this, when 
Logitech already has a 1080p webcam on 
its roster in the shape of the C922.
But looking back a year, we were critical 
of the Brio’s predecessor when it hit our 
reviews desk. Its somewhat noisy sensor, 
topping out at 30fps at full res, wasn’t 
good enough to justify its $100 price tag. 
It clearly lagged behind the much stronger 
sensors included with phones. “It’s time,” 
we said, “for the tech to take the next 
step.” So reproaching Logitech for going 
all out, when it has produced precisely the 
webcam we asked for, would be incredibly 
hypocritical of us. This really is that 
dream device: a higher resolution sensor, 
HDR support, wider angles, up to 90fps 
capture, and support for Windows Hello on 
board. Even the stand has been improved, 
including additional points of articulation, 
and a standard camera-mount thread, so 
the Brio can be attached to a tripod.
The fact that the Brio’s sensor can pull 
a respectable 4K image at 30fps shouldn’t 
be its major sell, though. It can certainly do 
that, although the results at full stretch are 
rather noisy and grainy. This is definitely 
still a webcam, as opposed to a broadcast-
ready 4K camera. It’s when you drop it 
down to more realistic resolutions that the

power behind the sensor really shows; at 
1080p 60fps, it’s crisp and smooth, and at 
720p 90fps—still a perfectly acceptable 
streaming resolution, we’d argue, and 
buttery with it—the results are remarkable. 
HDR support really does make a massive 
difference to the color depth, with scenes 
and lighting conditions that previously felt 
pallid and clammy rendering much truer. 
The breadth of the sensor has a bunch 
of uses beyond its full resolution, too. 
Below 4K, you can adjust the viewing angle 
between your choice of 65, 78, or a mighty 
90 degrees for those with particularly wide 
faces, or use the much-improved driver 
within the Logitech Gaming Software 
app to virtually pan and tilt its viewport, 
framing you perfectly, even if it’s not 
pointing directly at your face. You’re 
also given a high level of control over 
brightness, saturation, white balance, and 
more. Background replacement is still a 
thing and, thanks to the Hello-compatible 
infrared sensor, it’s much improved from 
the shoddy third-party implementation 
included with the C922. We still wouldn’t 
use it, as it’s pretty obvious, and it slips up 
on occasion, but it’s a solid stopgap if you’re 
unable to use a chroma key backdrop. 
Excellent webcam, then. Completely 
overspecced, which is a true positive. And 
so we forgive the lunatics in Logitech’s labs 
for their outrageous levels of ambition, and 
we’ll even give them a pass for the word 
“stream.” The results, at online broadcast 
resolution, are brilliant. It’s the finance 
department we take issue with at the end 
of the day. The Brio is, at this point, far too 
expensive, even considering the 12-month 
XSplit license that’s thrown in with it. 
Unless you’re a daily camera user whose 
audience—be it streaming, conferencing, 
or calling—will appreciate seeing every 
pore on your face in exquisite detail, $199 is 
a massive outlay, particularly considering 
that you’ll never really drive it as hard as it 
can go. –alex cox

There’s an expecTaTion when shopping for 
a case on a budget that you’re going to end 
up with a bum deal. If you’re looking around 
the $60 mark, the likelihood of finding one 
with anything resembling modern-day 
features is slim. Cable management and 
modern design come at a premium. Want a 
PSU cover, extensive radiator support, fan 
mounts, cable management, and tempered 
glass for less than $90? Get outta here!
The notion has always been that, cases 
being the least important part of any 
budget build, you should forsake the fancy 
features, and just get whatever’s available 
with the funds you have left after buying 
everything else. After all, cases are all 
pretty much the same at this price point. 
That’s why Phanteks’s Eclipse P300 
is one of the most exciting cases we’ve 
looked at this year. A $60 chassis, with a 
feature list longer than Kim Jong Un’s 
dinner menu. 
One glance at its design, and you can 
easily spot the PSU cover and the tempered 
glass side panel. But it’s only once you 
begin building in it that the true depth of 
Phanteks’s innovation begins to shine 
through. With 280mm AIO support in the 
front, including space-saving dust filters, 
located top and bottom, the forward-
facing panel provides two front-installed 
3.25-inch caddies for all your typical 
hard drive needs. Remove the rear side 
panel, and you’ll find a single Phanteks 
2.5-inch caddy for SSDs mounted to 
the back of the motherboard tray, and 
oodles of cable management room, as 
well. There’s a metal cable cover, too, not 
entirely dissimilar from the one in NZXT’s 
S310 case, yet coupled with Phanteks’s 
championed Velcro straps, of course.
And then there’s the lighting. Fully 
compatible with any of your aftermarket 
RGB synching technology from the likes of 
Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, et al, you do need to 
invest in the cable to integrate it.
Combine all that with support for up to 
E-ATX motherboards as big as 275mm in 
width, and it’s hard to pick fault with this

case. So, where are the drawbacks? Well, 
there’s a few. Firstly, the material used—
it’s a basic steel chassis at heart, making 
it somewhat flexible, and the paint job 
seems to attract greasy fingermarks. On 
top of that, there are no rubber grommets 
included, no GPU power cut-out in the 
PSU cover, and only a single 120mm fan 
installed at the rear of the chassis. Our 
biggest gripe, however, lies with the HDD 
caddies. Admittedly, we did decide to 
stick a 2TB WD Black drive in there, but 
the mounting holes in the toolless design 
simply didn’t support our drive, and we had 
to physically remove them from the caddy, 
then mount the hard drive with screws 
before installing it.
Ultimately, the Eclipse P300 is an 
astonishing feat of cost-cutting ingenuity. 
To find a case at this price point, packing 
so many modern design features, with so 
few drawbacks, is staggering. We’d love 
to see some other color variations in the 
future, and perhaps a V2 or a Pro line for 
$10 more that addresses our HDD issues 
and the lack of rubber grommets and GPU 
cut-outs. But that aside, it’s perfect for 
anyone looking to build a brand new budget 
rig. It’s a chassis that should sell well, and 
encourage other manufacturers to rethink 
what they include in their budget offerings. 
The P300 is to cases what Ryzen was to 
processors, and for that we can’t credit 
Phanteks enough. –Zak sTorey

Logitech’s Lightspeed is some seriously 
fascinating stuff. Even after checking 
out the groundbreaking G613 keyboard 
last issue, and the Powerplay mouse-
charging mat before that, we have 
absolutely no idea how it works, and can 
find no technical information on it beyond 
the company’s own marketing spiel. Buy 
into that, and Lightspeed is the result of 
repeated refinements of every component 
in 
the 
wireless 
signal 
chain, 
from 
antenna geometry to circuit pathways to 
communications protocols. And while we 
still suspect either a little number-fudging 
or suspicious time-travel chicanery, we’re 
happy to accept Logitech’s explanations. 
All of this in tandem results in a reported 
1ms response time, and absurdly long 
18-month battery life. 
Not both at the same time, though. You’ll 
only get that length of service from the 
G603’s dual AA batteries if you switch it to 
low response mode, via the base-mounted 
switch. This drops the polling rate from 
the full 1ms to a still-reasonable 8ms, and 
as you might expect, this has a noticeable 
effect on the mouse’s DPI. Keep it in hi-res 
1ms mode, and Logitech suggests you’ll 
get around 500 hours of gaming out of 
it—still very respectable, but as this lacks 
the rechargeable internal battery of its 
more expensive siblings, you’d better have 
cells on hand when the Logitech Gaming 
Software and its single indicator LED 
tell you time’s about up. Switching those 
batteries is quick and easy: Pull up on the

G603. The levered mouse buttons, which 
contact the microswitches at the same 
time they meet the solid braced frame 
of the upper shell. The precisely placed 
neodymium magnets, matching with fine 
steel screws for just the right amount of 
attraction. The internal slot for stowing the 
minuscule USB receiver while on the move. 
For what is, on the desk, an unassuming 
gray mouse—with just one tiny RGB LED, 
that you’ll rarely see lit, and nothing else 
in the way of bling—this is something of a 
secret winner. 
Even the stuff that you can’t see is pretty 
sharp. Every button, including the DPI 
toggle, can be configured and switched 
around. The resolution levels of Logitech’s 
Hero sensor can be minutely customized 
between 200 and 12,000, and all the 
relevant settings are stored within the 
mouse itself, meaning it’ll perform exactly 
as you expect, even if you’re taking it to a 
machine without the Logitech software 
suite on board. It’s easy enough to use the 
G603 with multiple machines as it is—it 
supports Bluetooth alongside Lightspeed, 
quickly switchable via a button on its 
underside, so if you’re doubling up on your 
desktop, you may be able to do without 
the KVM. 
If we were to stop gushing for a moment 
and be critical instead, as our stern-faced 
editors insist we must, there are a couple of 
holes we could just about pick. The G603’s 
slightly bulbous right-hand-only curve 
isn’t quite as comfortable for palm grip 
as we might have liked, for example, and 
its ratcheted wheel doesn’t have the same 
smooth bump as some of its competitors. 
Had the side buttons been a few eighths of 
an inch lower, they might have been more 
quickly accessible, although sitting directly 
above the natural grip position does mean 
it’s difficult to accidentally activate them. 
And maybe, just maybe, that price is too 
steep for you to consider for something 
so plain. But don’t be so vain; this is easily 
responsive enough for gaming, resilient 
enough for years of desktop use, and 
flexible enough for multiple machines. It’s 
worth the price. Lightspeed connectivity 
is sharp enough that it has to be at the 
top of your list of requirements if you’re 
considering new wireless peripherals, and 
the G603 is a reasonably cost-effective 
way in. –ALex cox

Fantasy battles meet battle fantasy once more
Total War: Warhammer II
GaminG’s Greatest merGer throws up 
another installment, but any worries about 
Total War moving to a Call of Duty-like 
release schedule are unfounded. As the 
second part of a trilogy that will eventually 
join up into one ubergame, Warhammer II 
takes everything about the first game, and 
subjects it to an upgrade and polish.
Selecting “Desynchronize animations” in 
Rome: Total War used to cause a graphics 
card to develop heatstroke, but these days 
the engine is well enough optimized that 
last-gen cards should handle the game 
without a problem. That’s not to suggest 
there’s a lack of incidental animations or 
effects, as your tiny magicians and mounted 
knights crackle with lightning and swish 
their tails in a constant flurry of movement. 
On the surface, little has changed. Total 
War is still a mixture of a strategic map 
game—in which you capture settlements 
and resources, recruit heroes, build 
armies, and sally forth to find other armies 
to get in a scrap with—and a tactical one, 
in which you take direct control of these 
regiments and heroes. Winning gains you 
experience and sometimes equipment 
for your hero, especially if you manage 
to take out an enemy lord, while losing 
sees your army either destroyed or reduced

slave-based economy seems like a great 
way to get rich, and break out the fancy

might not be too happy about their situation. 
You can rise above it all as the haughty High 
Elves, or as the levitating Lizardmen. If 
you’ve got the first Total War: Warhammer, 
you can use any of its races, too, and march 
across the Warhammer world’s equivalent 
of the Americas as Dwarfs or the Empire. 
Everything looks sharp, even zoomed 
right in, and the backdrops—all waterfalls 
and jungles—have had a new coat of paint. 
Freed from the need to provide a history 
lesson with every installment, Total War 
has reached new heights. And all it took was

to a shadow of its former self, and your

Beneath the surface, though, something 
is scuttling. The big draw is the ability 
to play as the Skaven, hordes of ornery 
technorodents, who huff warpstone like it’s 
paint thinner, and eat their captives. They’re 
lots of fun. There’s nothing like smashing 
into massed elven archers with a bunch 
of thuggish Rat Ogres, while your plague 
catapults pepper them with glowing green 
shots from afar. Reinforcements literally 
pour out of holes wherever the Skaven 
general chooses, right next to the cannons 
slaughtering your infantry, for example.

This fits in with the game’s structure, which 
is a race. There is a powerful thingy on 
the High Elves’ island, and it’s up to you to 
control that thingy before any other faction 
can. All this makes a mockery of the game’s 
diplomacy system, as no group is going to 
honor a non-aggression pact when you’re 
competing for the thingy, and makes the 
late game one of constant harrying from 
the remains of other races, as you complete 
rituals and defend settlements.

Look who’s Tolkien now
Middle-Earth: Shadow of War
This is huge. Shadow of War downloads 
with a 4K Cinematic Pack, and weighs in 
at 98GB. It’s like Warner Bros is going for 
some sort of record. Once you’ve waited 
for the game to install—it took us a whole 
morning—it’s time to beat up some orcs.
Games aren’t movies so much as 
theater. The addition of a human actor to 
the otherwise clockwork mechanics mucks 
things up as much as a falling lighting rig or 
a romantic lead forgetting his lines. Movies 
are the same every time you watch them, 
games are not—and, outside MMOGs, 
this is never more the case than with the 
Middle-Earth games. The first entry in the 
series introduced the Nemesis System, in 
which named enemies you don’t kill the 
first time you meet hold grudges, carry out 
ambushes, and become more powerful if 
they do manage to kill you.
The whole look is indebted to Peter 
Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, but 
the lead characters, human ranger Talion 
and elf-ghost Celebrimbor, take Tolkien 
to new depths of grimness. They’re 
dark knights who fight like Batman, 
terrifying their prey and leaping 
from enemy to enemy as they 
flit between weapons 
and spectral special

Throttling an orc, incidentally, drains 
their health, transfers it to you, then 
makes their head explode. So there’s that.

many other systems, moves, and features 
by a tutorial system that begins to feel like 
it’s never going away. The save system, 
conversely, very much seems to have 
gone away—it’s so transparent that it’s not 
clear if it’s saving or how long ago the last 
one was. The “unsaved data will be lost” 
warning when you quit takes on new terror 
when you’re really not sure….

There’s a point to this orc-wardness, and it’s 
taking control of fortresses. Each fortress 
is controlled by a war chief, who has several 
captains who boss the grunts about. We’ve 
played this game before—Crackdown

on his weaknesses, before taking him on, 
and capturing his fortress. There are also 
human cities to be protected, skills to be 
learned, weapons to be collected, followers 
to be recruited, and loot boxes to be opened.
Ah, yes, the Internet got very upset about 
loot boxes, but they’re nothing to worry 
about. Yes, your pal could buy legendary 
weapons and epic followers, and therefore 
have an easier time in the game, but you 
could spend the same amount of money on 
burgers, and probably have just as good 
a time. You earn currency from fights

2017 has been a great year for technology, 
with more major CPU launches in a single 
year than I can recall ever seeing. We’ve also 
had a lot of excitement in the GPU arena, with 
the GTX 1080 Ti, Titan Xp, Volta GV100 for 
deep learning, and AMD’s RX Vega. The last 
was disappointing, because on paper Vega 
looked like it might be a contender. Instead, 
we got a power-hungry GPU that couldn’t 
even claim a decisive win over Nvidia’s parts 
that launched a full year earlier.
But competition in the graphics card 
market can be brutal. The 1070 trails Vega 
56 by as much as 10–15 percent in individual 
games, and overall it’s a few percent 
slower. Never mind the supply problems 
AMD continues to experience several 
months after the official launch, with higher 
than expected pricing. Never mind the 
distinct lack of custom Vega cards—a few  
are on the way, 
but graphics card 
vendors seem to 
be 
just 
as 
unimpressed with 
Vega as we are, 
and cooling a card 
that can pull well 
north 
of 
350W 
when overclocked 
is no mean feat. 
AMD winning at 
any level simply won’t do, says Nvidia, so 
here’s an upgraded 1070 Ti.
Nvidia is pouring salt into the Vega 
wound, and it hurts. The 1070 Ti slots in 
nicely midway between the 1070 and 1080, 
in price as well as performance. But did we 
really need another high-end $450 Pascal-
based GPU? No, but it gives Nvidia a new 
product SKU for the holiday shopping spree, 
which is never a bad idea. More importantly, 
the 1070 Ti provides a solid 10–15 percent 
boost in performance relative to the vanilla 
1070. That’s enough to clearly beat Vega 56 
and match Vega 64.
But what I wanted was a GTX 1060 Ti to fill 
the void in the $300 space. Maybe next year.

major change was how we 
measure battery life. Instead 
of a standardized benchmark,

I fInd It hard to get excited about 
controllers. The use cases are slim, but 
a good controller is an essential part of 
any gaming enthusiast’s PC toolkit. After 
all, you can’t play every game with a 
mouse and keyboard. Well, you can, but 
lots of titles simply aren’t as enjoyable 
without a game controller. Platformers, 
racing sims, and fighting games all feel 
much better on a controller than with a 
precision pointer and clacky keys.
I’ve tried a few aftermarket ones in 
the past, so when Razer offered me the 
opportunity to try out its latest Wolverine 
controller, I jumped at the chance to give 
the big ugly mammal a run for its money.
So, it’s $160. It’s challenging to justify 
spending that much on a controller, 
especially when you can pick up a cheap 
Xbox one for just $26 on Newegg. Mind 
you, it does come with everything you’d 
ever need: an extensively long USB 
cable, three swappable thumbsticks, 
d-pad layouts, a cornucopia of buttons 
(with multiple triggers hidden away at 
the back), fully remappable buttons, and, 
of course, that old Razer favorite and 
drifter from the world of PC peripherals, 
RGB Chroma lighting.
That aside, the design is really nice. 
The sandblasted finish dodges greasy 
fingers well, and the rubber grips at 
the back feel premium and secure. 
Everything is solid, and it’s a stunning 
piece of gear to use, ergonomically 
slotting into your hand sweetly enough. 
The one thing I do wish is that it featured 
lighting on all the buttons. That said, 
if you got the cash, it’s actually a fair 
product for the price. –Zs

Seagate IronWolf 
Pro 12tB
I’m a sucker for storage, 
ludicrous amounts of 
storage. This is why I’ve 
decided that the batch 
of 12 5TB hard drives in one of my NAS 
units isn’t worthy of my decadent hardware 
obsession any longer. I’m going to upgrade 
them to Seagate’s new IronWolf Pro 12TB 
drives—all 12 drives. That’s 144TB of 
storage in one NAS.
Seagate’s IronWolf line is designed for 
the demanding 24-hour operation that’s 
required of a NAS-focused hard drive. 
There’s no rebooting or shutting down, and 
up time is everything. What’s more, the 
IronWolf Pro series is designed to go even 
further, which makes its five-year warranty 
worth the price premium. The hardware on 
the IronWolf Pro is also made to both last 
and endure punishing workloads. Seagate 
rates the drive at an average of 300TB of I/O 
per year, and the firmware on the drive is 
tuned for multiple simultaneous users.
In terms of raw speed, the IronWolf Pro 
is as fast as any 12TB spinning disk can get,  
with a 250MB/s transfer rate. Although 
this isn’t as fast as a SATA SSD, it’s fast 
when it’s set up as a RAID in a 12-drive 
configuration, and piped through a 10-gigabit 
Ethernet 
connection. 
Raw 
random 
access rates aren’t 
important, 
just 
total 
sustained 
throughput. 
Yes, 
for me, only the 
most 
ridiculous 
hardware 
will 
ever suffice.

Christmas is a-coming, 
and that means gifts. 
Now, 
call 
me 
old-
fashioned, but I like to 
put a little thought into 
the presents I give to the people who are 
closest to me. I rarely ask people for their 
lists, because I’m not that kinda guy. Don’t 
get me wrong, Amazon and lists have their 
place, but when it comes to my old pops and 
ma, nothing beats something handcrafted 
and tailor-made.
Which is why I do a lot of my Christmas 
shopping 
at 
Etsy. 
With 
small-scale 
businesses selling handmade goods, Etsy 
is a marketplace not too dissimilar from 
Amazon, but it’s the differences that make 
it infinitely more valuable in my eyes. 
Firstly, it’s a global marketplace—you can 
buy from and ship to anywhere the seller 
accommodates—and, more importantly, 
most of the merchandise is handcrafted by 
folks who care about it. You’ll struggle to 
find any of the big brands selling on Etsy, 
because it’s designed for handmade and 
unique goods. For example, to celebrate 
old Papa Storey’s 50th Christmas, I’ve gone 
ahead and invested in a custom-made Viking 
mead horn, with his initials engraved on the 
side of it. It should fit the bill nicely, I reckon. 
I’m kinda jealous.

SSDs have dropped in price,  
but HDDs are still ahead.
Stingy Storage
SSD prices are stuck at 
a stubbornly high level, 
typically four to five times 
that of a traditional hard 
drive of the same capacity. 
Why is it taking so long for 
prices to come down? And 
when do you see prices 
becoming more competitive 
with HDDs? –Steve Hartjes
ExEcutivE EDitor AlAn 
DExtEr rESponDS: SSDs 
have actually dropped in 
price significantly since 
they first hit our machines, 
sliding from around $3 
per GB in 2010 to just 
less than $0.5 per GB 
today. We are not saying 
they’re cheap, but they’re 
much cheaper than they 
were. Unfortunately, hard 
drives have also dropped 
in price, and continue to do 
so—for comparison, you’re 
looking at less than $0.04 
per GB now. Very roughly 
speaking, $50 will get you a 
128GB SSD or a 1TB HDD. 
Will we ever get to a 
point where we see parity 
between HDD and SSD 
pricing? I doubt it, because 
you’re not comparing like 
for like. Sure, they’re both 
used for storing data, but 
they work in very different 
ways, and rely on completely 
different technologies. 
The price hike this year is 
down to a general demand 
for flash storage, while 
hard drive pricing has been 
stable for a long time now.
There’s a key factor that 
I haven’t mentioned so far, 
and that’s performance. If 
you’re only interested in 
raw storage, hard drives 
are still your best option, 
and they’re not going 
to go anywhere soon. 
However, if you care about 
how quickly you access 
that data, the value (and 
price) of SSDs increases 
significantly. We’ve been 
banging the performance 
drum for years, and if 
you’re not convinced by 
the benchmarks, it’s worth 
trying an SSD first-hand. I 
wouldn’t consider building 
a machine without an SSD 
these days. And for serious 
storage, I’d still have a hard 
drive spinning alongside it.
Total Coverage
I’m curious why you chose to 
use an AIO that doesn’t have 
100 percent coverage? The 
Enermax TR240 and TR360 
both cover 100 percent. 
Using the 240 in pull mode, 
I have yet to see my temps 
go above 60 C, and that’s the 
temps AMD is reporting, so 
depending on which offset 
you go by, my 1920x stays 
insanely cool under 100 
percent load. I know they are 
hard to find in stock, but if 
you want to get the max out 
of the chip, you shouldn’t 
skimp on the cooling just 
because AMD included a 
free bracket. 
–Scags
DEputy EDitor ZAk StorEy 
rESponDS: Threadripper is 
a big chip, but in reality, the 
die under the IHS isn’t the 
entire size of the IHS. 100 
percent coverage, in our 
testing at least, makes little 
difference with regard to 
overall temps. We decided 
to use the Kraken because, 
at the time of writing, there 
were very few full-cover 
coolers out there, and the 
Kraken was the staple AIO 
for all our test benches.
Also, Threadripper 
behaves very much like its 
top-end mainstream Ryzen 
counterpart, the 1800X. In 
short, it’s not temperature 
that limits overclocks, but 
silicon stability. If you can 
get over 4.1GHz on your chip, 
you’re exceptionally lucky.
All that aside, our 
Threadripper sample isn't 
a hot chip. We have a single 
Noctua tower cooler (the 
NH-U14S TR4) currently

sitting happily chilling our 
4GHz (@ 1.35V) overclocked 
1950X, and it’s only hitting 
75 C max under load.
Stuttering Ryzen
I’ve seen Maximum PC 
mention multiple times 
now how Ryzen can cause 
stuttering in some games. 
As a gamer, that sounds like 
a nightmare scenario, and 
makes me want to avoid the 
platform like the plague. I 
was wondering if you might 
be able to give this more 
in-depth coverage. Some 
examples of games that have 
this problem, how much 
measured stutter there is, 
reach out to AMD for any 
response, and so on. While 
it sounds like a great CPU 
performer overall, the last 
thing any gamer wants is 
stuttering performance from 
new hardware! –Ross Scott
DEputy EDitor ZAk StorEy 
rESponDS: We have noticed 
some micro-stuttering 
in one of our major 
benchmarks—Total War: 
Attila. But it’s not a good 
example of an optimized 
game (partly why we include 
it in our benchmarking 
suite), so don't expect it to 
be the case for most games. 
As Ryzen is still a fairly new 
architecture in terms of 
resource allocation, there 
were a few hiccups early on 
with some games that were 
no longer being supported, 
Attila being one of them. 
In all modern titles, the 
stuttering is non-existent, 
although you do lose out 
on a few fps at 1080p with 
most games, due to the 
competition’s superior 
single-core performance.
I’ve been running a 
Ryzen 7 1700 at home, and 
have had little in the way of 
issues so far. The only game 
that does come to mind 
outside of Total War: Attila 
(all the other Total War 
games are fine) is the first 
Dishonored, stuttering with 
SLI enabled, but running 
fine with it disabled.
Unfortunately, this is a 
case by case basis, which 
ultimately lies on the side 
of the game developers, 
rather than that of the chip 
manufacturer. And as these 
games inevitably get older, 
and we advance into newer 
OSes, it becomes ever more 
likely that older titles will 
stop running entirely due to 
software issues, more so 
than any particular change 
to hardware.
Dead on Arrival
In the June 2017 issue of 
Maximum PC, on page 92, 
in the last paragraph, you 
write that one motherboard 
was dead on arrival (DOA), 
but you do not specifically 
state which motherboard 
it was. Which motherboard 
was DOA? How come it was 
not mentioned in any of the 
reviews? 
–Scott Finly
DEputy EDitor ZAk StorEy 
rESponDS: The motherboard 
in question was the MSI 
B350M Mortar. It was never 
mentioned in any of the 
reviews because it was 
never actually reviewed. 
Under closer inspection 
from MSI, the board had 
suffered damage to the 
VRMs during transit, and 
unfortunately we just didn’t 
have enough time to get 
it into the group test or a 
separate review. To be fair 
to MSI, we do see plenty of 
dead gear, and having seen 
how hardware is handled 
by couriers, this doesn’t 
surprise us in the least.
Positive Switch
After reading the console 
head to head, I now know 
true review bias. I don’t 
know where those price 
figures are coming from, 
but the Nintendo Switch I 
got has an MSRP $299, so 
where did $369 come from? 
And the round-up is very 
biased already, since the 
Switch AFAIK isn’t a media 
playback device. And to call 
the Joy-Con’s grip “plastic” 
is ridiculous, as the same 
can be said of the Xbox and 
PS4 plastic controllers. I am 
beginning to see fanboy bias 
from the start. 
Now, if this were a proper 
review that rated gaming 
enjoyment, that would be 
different, but it reads as 
though it’s a poor review just 
to satisfy your disdain for 
the Nintendo Switch and how 
popular it is. Your article 
forgets that it’s currently 
selling better than the Xbox 
and PS4. Nintendo isn’t 
there to cater to outdated 
thinking, but to innovate 
when others are afraid to 
take the leap in console 
portability or next-gen 
gaming innovations.
For all the nitpicks about 
Switch hardware, neither 
the Xbox nor PS4 has come 
up with anything to rival 
the Switch in terms of 
innovation, other than “Hey, 
look, it’s 4K!” I say meh to 
that. How much enjoyment 
are you getting, from just 
a fun-to-play perspective? 
That’s something this article 
omits. And there are third 
parties making products 
to make the Switch easier 
to take on the road as well. 
That’s what it’s all about for 
me: the “fun-to-play” factor.
 
–Robert Schnider
ExEcutivE EDitor AlAn 
DExtEr rESponDS: The 
pricing was taken at the 
time of writing, and because 
of the high demand for the 
console, it was the best 
price we could find (even 
now, many sites are out 
of stock). As to your other 
points, Alex Cox, who wrote 
the piece in question, is a big 
fan of his Nintendo Switch, 
and heartily recommends 
it, but the point of the piece 
was not to simply sing the 
praises of any one console 
because of one single 
reason, but to give readers 
an overview of the consoles 
that are currently available. 
As for your accusation of 
bias: We are biased here 
on Maximum PC, but just 
toward PCs (naturally). We 
have no preference when it 
comes to this latest batch 
of consoles; they are just 
playthings, after all.

Microsoft's latest console makes for a much better HDR Blu-
ray player than your PC. What else is there to like about it?
The Xbox One X is the closest any console’s come to the 
power and functionality of a gaming PC. It runs on a custom 
version of Windows, and has components that roughly 
compare to a $500 gaming PC, with enough GPU power 
and memory to run games at 4K, but a relatively weak CPU 
compared to a Core i5 or i7. We’ve been using the Xbox One 
X in the living room as an alternative to Steam's Big Picture 
mode, trying to get a feel for how this console compares to 
Microsoft's first stab at the Xbox One, which was big, ugly, 
and had a borderline-unusable OS. The Xbox One X is an 
impressively powerful and compact box, by comparison.

There’s noT a huge amounT of change this month for our mid-range 
build. Last issue, we touched on the notion of swapping out to an 
Intel Core i5-8400 solution; however, due to high demand and the 
lack of availability reported from Intel, we simply can’t recommend 
a system that may not be in stock until February at the earliest, so 
Ryzen it is. Don’t get us wrong, Intel’s latest Core i5-8400 series 
chip is a stomper, but if it’s not available, it’s not available. That said, 
the Ryzen 5 1600 is hardly a wet fish, and still a good solution at this 
price point. We did have to change the memory out to a lower specced 
G.Skills Ripjaws solution, instead of the classier Trident Z, but that 
aside, there’s little else to complain about here. The GTX 1070 is also 
still a solid solution for 1080 and 1440p gaming, and we haven’t been 
hands-on enough with the GTX 1070 Ti just yet to suggest swapping 
out to that overclocking king.
guys, guys! That’s a $3 price drop on memory. Stop the press! OK, 
joking aside, we’re finally getting confirmation that DRAM production 
is being upped at the start of next year, with Samsung committing 
one of its production facilities and an additional floor elsewhere to 
manufacturing memory. On top of that, SK Hynix and Toshiba are 
also upping their production lines at the end of 2018, so perhaps, at 
last, we’ll see those prices drop. Anyhow, that aside, we’ve finally 
jumped the gun, and swapped across to Ryzen 3 for our budget 
build. The Ryzen 3 1200 is a perfect little quad-core, ready for any 
gaming or general-use task you can throw at it. Couple it with some 
good memory, a decent GPU, and ASRock’s AB350, and you’ll have 
the perfect base rig for anything you set your mind to. Rendering? 
Upgrade to a Ryzen 7 1700 and 16GB of DDR4. Gaming more your 
jam? Throw in a GTX 1070 Ti instead.

It felt odd for us to keep recommending the trusty Pentium 
G4560, so this issue we decided to swap it out in favor of a 
budget offering from AMD. The Ryzen 3 1200 stomps the 
field when it comes to multithreaded applications, and its 
single-threaded performance isn’t bad either for the money. 
On top of that, if you’ve got a suitable cooling solution behind 
it, you can throw some extra volts into that bad boy, and 
get even more performance out of it for free, unlike the 
Pentium. If you’re looking for the perfect budget-busting 
processor to start out a new build or upgrade an aging one, 
the Ryzen 3 1200 fits right in, like Bill Murray fits into comedy. 
$110, www.amd.com 
so, we’ve dropped down to a slightly lower spec memory kit this issue, 
and it’s still costing us $10 more than last month. On the plus side, 
it’s RGB…. So, that’s a thing. Apart from that, we haven’t changed a 
great deal. The 1920X is a fantastic 12-core part, capable of delivering 
some incredible rendering performance. Combine that with 32GB of 
high-spec DDR4 and the GTX 1080 Ti, and you have yourself a machine 
that can be put to any task without fear. A batch of Noctua air coolers 
have recently arrived in the office, which are perfect for Threadripper, 
but unfortunately not yet available on Newegg. So, for the time being, 
we’re sticking with the Kraken X62, as its block is more than enough to 
cool all four of those Ryzen dies, and ramp up the overclock to 4GHz, 
ensuring you can game just as well as you can render. Don’t believe 
us? We currently have the 1950X running off a single Noctua air cooler, 
with two fans, clocked at 4GHz, registering 75 C under load. 
As far as storage goes, it may well be that in the future we jump up 
to one of Intel’s latest Optane-powered SSDs, but until they’re on the 
market, and we’ve had more time to test just how well they perform in 
real-world benchmarks, we’ll stick with what we’ve got.
The one place we would like to make a change is that chassis. The 
Eclipse P400S is a well-equipped ATX-supporting beast, but swapping 
out to a newer NZXT H700i would spruce up this build, and add some 
smart features through AI-controlled fan curves and more, which 
would be perfect for this kind of system.
