PREFACE
THE heroic age of non-euclidean geometry is passed.
It is long since the days when Lobatchewsky timidly
referred to his system
as an
* imaginary geometry',
and the new subject appeared
as a dangerous lapse
from the orthodox doctrine of Euclid.
The attempt to
prove the parallel axiom by means of the other usual
assumptions is now seldom undertaken, and those who
do
undertake
it,
are
considered
in
the
class with
circle-squarers and searchers for perpetual motion
sad
by-products of the creative activity of modern science.
In this, as in all other changes, there is subject both
for rejoicing and regret.
It is a satisfaction to a writer
on
non-euclidean geometry that he may proceed
at
once to his subject, without feeling any need to justify
himself,
or,
at
least, any more need than any other
who adds to our supply of books.
On the other hand,
he will miss the stimulus that comes to one who feels
that he
is bringing out something entirely new and
strange.
The subject of non-euclidean geometry is, to
the mathematician,
quite as well established
as any
other branch of mathematical science
; and, in fact,
it
may lay claim to a decidedly more
solid basis than
some branches, such as the theory of assemblages, or
the analysis situs.
Recent books dealing with non-euclidean geometry
fall naturally into two
classes.
In the one we find
the works of Killing, Liebmann, and Manning,* who

PREFACE
wish to build up certain clearly conceived geometrical
systems, and are careless of the details of the founda-
tions on which all
is to
rest.
In the other category
are
Hilbert, Vahlen,
Veronese, and
the
authors of
a goodly number
of
articles on
the
foundations
of
geometry.
These
writers
deal
at
length
with
the
consistency, significance, and logical independence of
their assumptions, but do not go very
far towards
raising a superstructure on any one of the foundations
suggested.
The present work
is, in a measure, an attempt to
unite the two tendencies.
The author's own
interest,
be
it stated
at the
outset,
lies mainly in the
fruits,
rather than in the roots
; but the day is past when the
matter of axioms may be dismissed with the remark
that we
' make all of Euclid's assumptions except the
one about
parallels'.
A
subject
like ours
must be
built up from explicitly stated assumptions, and nothing
else.
The author would have preferred, in the
first
chapters, to start from some system of axioms already
published, had he been familiar with any that seemed to
him suitable to establish simultaneously the euclidean
and the principal noii-euclideaii systems in the way that
he wished. The system of axioms here used is decidedly
more cumbersome than some others, but leads to the
desired goal.
There are three natural approaches to non-euclidean
geometry.
(1) The elementary geometry of point, line,
and distance.
This method is developed in the open-
ing chapters and
is the most obvious.
(2) Projcctive
geometry, and the theory
of transformation groups.
This method is not taken up until Chapter XVIII, not
because it is one whit less important than the first, but

PREFACE
5
because
it seemed better not to interrupt the natural
course of the narrative by interpolating an alternative
beginning.
(3)
Differential geometry, with the con-
cepts of distance-element, extremal, and space constant.
This method is explained in the last chapter, XIX.
The author has imposed upon himself one or two
very definite limitations.
To begin with, he has not
gone beyond three dimensions.
This is because of his
feeling that, at any rate in a first study of the subject, the
gain in generality obtained by studying the geometry
of ^-dimensions
is more than
offset by the
loss of
clearness and naturalness.
Secondly, he has confined
himself, almost exclusively, to what may be called the
' classical
'
non-euclidean
systems.
These
are much
more closely allied
to the euclidean system than
are
any others, and have by far the most historical impor-
tance.
It
is also evident that a system which gives
a simple and clear interpretation of ternary and qua-
ternary orthogonal substitutions, has a totally different
sort of mathematical significance from, let us say, one
whose points are determined by numerical values
in
a non-archimedian number system.
Or again, a non-
euclidean plane which may be interpreted as a surface
of constant
total
curvature, has a more
lasting geo-
metrical importance than a non-desarguian plane that
cannot form part of a three-dimensional space.
The majority
of material in
the present work
is,
naturally, old. A reader, new to the subject, may find
it wiser at the first reading to omit Chapters X, XV,
XVI, XVIII, and XIX.
On the other hand, a reader
already somewhat
familiar with
non-euclidean
geo-
metry, may find his greatest interest in Chapters X
and XVI, which contain the substance of a number of

6
PREFACE
recent papers on the extraordinary line geometry of
rion-euclidean
space.
Mention may
also
be made
of Chapter XIV which
contains
a number
of
neat
formulae
relative
to
areas
and
volumes
published
many years ago by Professor d'Ovidio, which are not,
perhaps,
very
familiar
to
English-speaking
readers,
and Chapter XIII, where Staude's string construction
of the
ellipsoid
is
extended
to
non-euclidean space.
It
is hoped
that
the
introduction
to
non-euclidean
differential geometry
in Chapter XV may prove
to
be more comprehensive
than
that
of Darboux, and
more comprehensible than that of Bianchi.
The
author
takes
this
opportunity
to
thank
his
colleague,
Assistant-Professor Whittemore, who
has
read in manuscript Chapters XV and XIX.
He would
also
offer affectionate thanks to his former teachers,
Professor Eduard Study of Bonn and Professor Corrado
Segre
of Turin, and
all others who have aided and
encouraged
(or
shall we
say
abetted?) him
in
the
present work.

CHAPTER
I
FOUNDATION FOR METRICAL GEOMETRY
IN A LIMITED REGION
IN any system of geometry we must begin by assuming
the existence of certain fundamental objects, the raw material
with which we
are
to work.
What
names we
choose
to
attach
to these objects
is
obviously a
question quite apart
from the nature of the logical connexions which
arise from
the various relations assumed to
exist among them, and
in
choosing these names we are guided principally by tradition,
and by a desire
to make
our
mathematical
edifice as well
adapted as
possible to the
needs of
practical
life.
In
the
present work we
shall
assume
the
existence
of two
sorts
of
objects,
called
respectively points and
distances.*
Our
explicit assumptions shall be as follows
:
* There is no logical or mathematical reason why the point should be taken
as undefined rather than the line or plane.
This in, however, the invariable
custom
in works on
the
foundations of geometry,
and,
considering
the
weight
of historical and psychological tradition
in
its
favour,
the
point,
will probably continue to stand among the fundamental indefinables.
With
regard
to the others, there is no such unanimity.
Veronese, Fondamenti di
geometria, Padua, 1891, takes the line, segment, and congruence of segments.
Schur,
t Ueber die Grundlagen dcr Geometrie,' Mathematische Annalen,
vol.
Iv, 1902, uses segment and motion.
Hilbert,
Die
Grundlagen
der
Geometric,
Leipzig,
1899, uses practically the same indefinables
as Veronese.
Moore,
' The projective Axioms of Geometry,* Transactions of the American Mathematical
Society, vol.
iii, 1902, and Veblen,
* A System of Axioms for Geometry/ sanio
Journal,
vol.

1904,
use
segment and
order.
Fieri,
* Bella
geometria
elementare come sistema ipotetico deduttivo,' Memorie della E. Accadcmia dcllc
Scienze
di
Torino, Serie
2, vol. xlix,
1899, introduces motion
alone, as does
Padoa,
* Uii nuovo sistema di definizioni per la geometria euclidea,' Periodico
di niatcmatica, Serie 3, vol.
i, 1903.
Vahlen, Abstrakte Geometric, Leipzig, 1905,
uses line and separation.
Peano,

Levy,
' I

1
Memorie
Accad.
Torino, Serie 2, vol. liv, 1904, use distance.
I have made the same choice as
the last-named authors, as it seemed to me to give the best approach to the
problem
in hand.
I cannot but feel that the choice of segment or order
would be a mistake for our present purpose, in spite of the very condensed
system
of axioms which Veblen has set up
therefor.
For
to reach con-
gruence and measurement by this means, one
is
obliged to introduce the
six-parameter group
of motions
(as in Ch. XVIII of this work),
i. o. base
metrical geometry on projective.
It is, on the other hand, an inelegance to
base projective geometry on a non-projective conception such as
' between-

I.
There
exists a
class of
objects, containing at
least two members, called points.
It
will be convenient
to indicate points by
large Roman
letters as A,
B,
G.
AXIOM
II.
The existence of any two points implies the
existence of a unique object called their distance.
If the points be A and B it will be convenient to indicate
their distance by AB or BA.
We
shall speak of
this also
as the distance
betiveen the two
points, or from one to the
other.
We next assume
that between two
distances
there may
exist a relation expressed by saying that the one is congruent
to the
other.
In place of the words

shall write the symbol

The following assumptions shall

:
AXIOM III.
AB = AB.
AXIOM IV.
AA = KB.
AXIOM V.
If AB = CD and CD = EF, then AB = EF.
These might have
been put into
purely logical form by
saying that we assumed that every distance was congruent
to
itself,
that
the
distances
of any two
pairs
of
identical
points
are
congruent,
and
that
the
congruent
relation
is
transitive.
Let us next assume that there may exist a triadic relation
connecting
three
distances which
is expressed by a saying
that the first AB
is congruent to the sum of the second CD
and the third PQ.
This shall be written AB = CD + PQ.
AXIOM VI. If AB = CD + PQ, then AB = PQ + CD.
VII. If AB = CD + PQ and PQ = M, then
AS = CD + MS.
AXIOM VIII.
If AB = CD + PQ and A'B* = AB, then

AB = AB + CO.

The
distance of two identical points

Definition.
If AB and CD be two such distances that there
exists a not null distance PQ fulfilling the condition that AB
is congruent to the sum of CD and PQ, then AB shall be said
to be greater than CD.
This is written AB > CD.
Definition.
If AB > CD} then CD shall be said to be
less
than AB.
This is written CD < AB.
AXIOM X.
Between any two distances AB and CD there
exists one, and only one, of the three relations
= CD\ AB>CD, AB < CD.
Theorem
1.
If AB = CD, then CD = AB.
_
For we
could
not
have ABCD + PQ
where PQ was
not
null.
Nor could we have CD = AB -f PQ
for then, by
VIII, AB = AB + PQ contrary to X.
Theorem 2.
If AB = CD + PQ and <77/ = CD, then
The proof is immediate.
AXIOM XI.
If A and C be any two points
there
exists
such a point B distinct from either that
This
axiom
is
highly
significant.
In
the
first
place
it
clearly involves the existence of an infinite number of points.
In the second
it removes the possibility of a maximum
dis-
tance.
In other words, there
is no distance which may not
be extended in either direction.
It is, however, fundamentally
important
to
notice
that we
have made no assumption
as
to the magnitude
of the amount by which a distance may
be
so extended; we have merely premised
the existence
of
such
extension.
We
shall make
the
concept
of
extension
more
explicit by the following definitions.
Definition. The assemblage of all points C possessing the
property that AB == AC+CB shall be called the segment of
A and B, or of B and A, and written (AB) or (BA).
The
points A and B shall be called the extremities of the segment,
all other points thereof shall be said to be within it.
Definition.
The assemblage of all points 5 different from
A and C such that AB = AC + CB shall be called the extension
of (AC) beyond C.

OIL
AXIOM XII.
If AB = AC+ CB where AC = AD + DC,
then
AB = AD + DB where DB = DC + CB.
The effect t)f this axiom is to establish a serial order among
the points
of a segment and
its extensions, as will be seen
from the following theorems.
We shall also be able to show
that our distances are scalar magnitudes, and that addition of
distances is associative.
AXIOM XIII. If AB
PQ + RS
there
is
a single point
(7 of (AB) such that AC = PQ 9 CB = Bflf.
Theorem 3.
If AB > CD and CD > EF9 then AB>JEF.
To begin with AB = EF is impossible._If then EF>A #,
let us put E~F=EG + GF, where EG = AB.
Then
CD = CH + Hb', CH=EF.
Then
CD-CK + KD-, OR = AB
which is against our hypothesis.
We see as a corollary, to this, that if C and D be_any two
points of (AB) 9 one at least being within it, AB > CD.
It
will
follow
from XIII
that two
distinct points
of
a
segment cannot determine congruent distances from either end
thereof.
We also see from XII that if C be a point of (AB),
and D a point of (AC), it
is likewise a point
of (AB).
Let
the reader show further that every point of a segment, whose
extremities belong to a given segment,
is,
itself, a point of
that segment.
Theorem
4.
If C be a point of (AB), then every point D of
(AB) is^either_a point of (AC) or of (CB).
_
If AC = Ip we have C and J) identical.
If AC > AD wo
may find a point of (AC) [and so of (A JS)] whose distance from
A is congruent to AD, and this will be identical with D.
If
AC < AD we find C as a point of (AD), and hence, by XII,
D is a point of (CB).

Definition. The assemblage of all points of a segment and
its extensions shall be called a line.
Definition. Two lines having in common a single point are
said to cut or intersect in that point.
Notice that we have not as yet assumed the existence of
two such lines. We shall soon, however, make this assumption
explicitly.
AXIOM XIV. Two lines having two common distinct points
are identical.
The line determined by two points A and B shall be written
AB or BA.
Theorem

If C be a point of
the

of (AB)
beyond B and D another point of this same extension, then D
is a point of (BO)

C = TH) or EC >
/)
; otherwise G
is
a point of (BD).
AXIOM XV. All points do not lie in one line.
AXIOM XVI.
If B be a point of (CD) and E a point of
(AB) where A is not a point of the line BO, then the line DE
contains a point F of (AC).
The first of these axioms is clearly nothing but an existence
theorem.
The second specifies certain conditions under which
two lines, not given by means of common points, must, never-
theless,
intersect.
It
is clear that some such assumption
is
necessary in order to proceed beyond the geometry of a single
straight line.

Theorem 11.
If two distinct points A and B be given, there
is an infinite number of distinct points which belong to their
segment.
This theorem is an immediate consequence of the last two
axioms.
It may be interpreted otherwise by saying that there
is no minimum distance, other than the null distance.
Theorem 12. The mainfold
of
all points
of a segment
is
dense.
Theorem 13.
If A,
B,
(7, D, E form the
configuration
of
points described in Axiom XVI, the point E is a point of (DF).
Suppose that
this were not the
case.
We
should
either
have -Fas a point of (DE) or D as a point of (EF).
But then,
in the first case, G would be a point of (DE) and in the second
D would be a point of (BC), both of which are inconsistent
with our data.
Definition.
Points which belong to the same line shall be
said to be on
it or to be collinear.
Lines which contain the
same point
shall be
said to pass through
it, or to be con-
current.
Theorem 14,
If A, B, C be three non-collinear points, andD
a point within (AB) while E is a point of the extension of
(BC) beyond
C, then
the
line DE
will contain a point F
of (AC).
Take
(?, a point of (ED), different from E and D.
Then AG
will contain a point L of (BE), while G belongs to (AL).
If L
and G be
identical, G
will be the point required.
If L be
a
point
of (CE) then EG goes through F within (AG) as
required.
If L be within (BC), then EG goes through 11 of
(AC) and K of (AE) y so
that, by
13, G and H are
points
of (BK). H must then, by 4, either be a point of (BG) or of
(GK).
But
if // be a point of (BG), C
is a point of (BL),
which
is
untrue.
Hence H
IB a
point of (GK\ and (AH)
contains F of (EG).
We see also that it is impossible that C
should
belong
to
(AF)
or A
to
(FC).
Hence F belongs
to (AC).
Theorem 15.
If A, B, G be
three non-collinear points, no
three
points,
one within
each of
their
three
segments,
are
collinear.
The proof is left to the reader.
Definition. If three non-collinear points be given, the locus
of all points of all segments determined by each of these, and
all
points
of the segment
of the other two,
shall be called
a Triangle.
The points originally chosen shall be called the

vertices, their segments the
sides.
Any point of the triangle,
not on one of its sides, shall be said to be within it.
If the
three given points be A, J3, C their triangle shall be written
A ABC.
Let the reader show that this triangle
is completely
determined by
all
points of
all segments having A
as one
extremity, while the other belongs to (BO).
It
is interesting to notice that XVI, and 13 and 14, may be
summed up as follows *
:
Theorem
16.
If a
line
contain a point
of one
side
of a
triangle and one of either extension of a second side, it will
contain a point of the third side.
Definition. The assemblage of all points of all lines deter-
mined
by
the
vertices
of a
triangle and
all
points of the
opposite sides shall be called a plane.
It should be noticed that in defining a plane in this manner,
the vertices of the triangle play a special rdle.
It is our next
task
to show
that
this
specialization
of
function
is
only
apparent, and that any other three non-collinear points of the
plane might equally well have been chosen to define it.f
Theorem 17.
If a plane be determined by the vertices of a
triangle, the following points lie therein
:
(a) All points
of every
line determined by a vertex, and
a point of the line of the other two vertices.
(b)
All points of every line which contains a point of each
of two sides of the triangle.
(c) All points of every line containing a point of one side
of the triangle and a point of the line of another side.
(d) All points of every line which contains a point of the
line of each of two sides.
The proof will come at once from
16, and from the con-
Jiideration that
if we know two points of a line, every other
point thereof is either a point of their segment, or of one of its
extensions.
The plane determined by three points as A, B, G
shall be
written
the
plane ABC.
We are thus led
to
the
following theorem.
Theorem 18. The plane determined by three vertices of a
triangle
is
identical with
that determined by two of their
number
and any
other
point
of the
line
of
either
of
the
remaining
sides.
* Some writers, as Pasch, Neuere Geometric, Leipzig, 1882, p. 21, give Axiom
XVI in this form.
I have followed Veblen, loc. cit., p. 351, in weakening the
axiom to the form given.
f The treatment of the plane and space which constitute the rest of this
chapter are taken largely from Schur,
loc.
cit.
He
in turn
confesses his
indebtedness to Peano.

Theorem 19. Any one of the three points determining a plane
may be replaced by any other point of the plane, not collinear
with the two remaining determining points.
Theorem 20. A plane may be determined by any three of
its points which are not collinear.
Theorem 21. Two planes having three non-collinear points
in common are identical.
Theorem 22.
If two points of a line lie in a plane, all points
thereof lie in that plane.
AXIOM XVII. All points do not lie in one plane.
Definition. Points or lines which lie in the same plane shall
be called coplanar.
Planes which include the same line shall
be
called coaxal.
Planes, like
lines, which include the same
point,
shall be called concurrent.
Definition,
If four non-coplanar points be given, the assem-
blage of all points of all segments having for one extremity
one of these points, and for the other, a point of the triangle
of the other three,
shall be called a tetrahedron.
The four
given points shall be called its vertices, their six segments
its
edges, and the
four
triangles
its
faces.
Edges
having
no
common vertex shall be called opposite.
Let the reader show
that, as a matter of fact, the tetrahedron will be determined
completely by
means
of
segments,
all
having
a common
extremity at one vertex, while the other extremity is in the
face of the other three vertices.
A vertex may also be said
to be opposite to a face, if it do not lie in that face.
Definition. The assemblage of all points of all lines which
contain either a vertex of a tetrahedron, and a point of the
opposite
face, or two points of two opposite edges, shall be
called a
space.
It will be seen that a space, as so defined,
is made up of
fifteen regions, described as follows
:
(a) The tetrahedron itself.
(h) Four regions composed of the extensions beyond each
vertex of segments having one extremity there, and the other
extremity in the opposite face.
(c) Four
regions composed of the other extensions of the
segments mentioned in
(6).
(d) Six
regions
composed
of the
extensions
of segments
whose extremities are points of opposite edges.
Theorem 23.
All points

lie
in
the
space
defined by
the
vertices
of a
given
tetrahedron.
(a) A plane containing an edge, and a point of the opposite
edge.
(6) A line containing a vertex, and a point of the plane
of the opposite
face.
(c) A line containing a point of one edge, and a point of the
line of the opposite edge.
(d) A
line containing a point
of the
line of each
of two
opposite
edges.
(e) A line containing a point of one edge, and a point of the
plane of a face not containing that edge.
(/) A line containing a point of the lino of one edge, and
a point of the plane of a face not containing that edge.
The proof will come
directly
if we take the steps in the
order
indicated, and hold
fast to
16, and the
definitions of
line, plane, and
space.
Theorem 24. In determining a space, any vertex of a tetra-
hedron may be replaced by any other point, not a vertex, on
the line of an edge through the given vertex.
Theorem 25. In determining a space, any vertex of a tetra-
hedron may be
replaced
by any point
of that
space,
not
coplanar with the
other three
vertices.
Theorem 26. A space may be determined by any four of its
points which are not coplanar.
Theorem
27. Two
spaces which
have
four
non-coplanar
points in common are identical.
Theorem 28. A space contains wholly every line whereof it
contains two distinct points.
Theorem 29. A space contains wholly every plane whereof
it contains three non-collinear points.
PRACTICAL LIMITATION.
Points belonging to different spaces
shall not be considered simultaneously in the present work.*
Suppose that we have a plane containing the point E of the
segment
(AB) but no point of the segment (BC ).

three dimensions.

;
or, more specifically, it must lie in a plane con-
taining one edge, and a point of the opposite edge.
Every
such plane will contain a line of the plane EFG> as may be
immediately proved, and 16 will show that in every case this
plane must contain either a point of (AC) or one of (BC).
Theorem 30.
If a plane contain a point of one
side of a
triangle, but no point of a second side, it must contain a point
of the third.
Theorem 31.
If a line in the plane of a triangle contain
a point of one side of the triangle and no point of a second
side, it must contain a point of the third side.
Definition.
If a
point within
the segment
of two given
points be in a given plane, those points shall be
said to be
on opposite sides of the plane
; otherwise, they shall be said to
be on the same side of the plane.
Similarly, we may define
opposite sides of a line.
Theorem 32.
If two points be on the same side of a plane,
a point opposite to one
is on the same side as the other
; and
if two points be on the same
side, a point opposite to one
is
opposite to both.
The proof comes at once from 30.
Theorem 33.
If two planes have a common point they have
a common line.
Let P be the common point.
In the first plane take a line
through P.
If this be
also a
line of the second
plane, the
theorem
is proved.
If not, we may take two points
of this
line on opposite sides of the second plane.
Now any other
point of the
first plane, not
collinear with the three already
chosen, will be opposite to one of the last two points, and thus
determine another line of the first plane which intersects the
second
one.
We hereby
reach
a second
point common
to
the two planes, and the line connecting the two
is common
to both.
It
is immediately evident that
all points common to the
two planes
lie in
this
line.

CHAPTER
II
CONGRUENT TRANSFORMATIONS
IN Chapter I we laid the foundation for the present work.
We made a number of
explicit assumptions, and, building
thereon,
we
constructed
that
three-dimensional
type
of
space wherewith we
shall, from now
on, be occupied.
An
essential point in our system of axioms
is
this.
We have
taken as a fundamental indefinable, distance, and this, being
subject to the
categories
greater and
less,
is a magnitude.
In other words, we have laid the basis for a metrical geometry.
Yet, the principal use that we have made of these metrical
assumptions,
has
been
to
prove
a number
of
descriptive
theorems.
In order to complete our metrical system properly
we shall need two more assumptions, the one to give us the
concept of continuity, the other to establish the possibility of
congruent transformations.
AXIOM
XVIII.
If
all
points
of
a
segment
(AB)
be
divided
into two such
classes
that no
point
of the
first
shall
be
at
a greater
distance from A
than
is any point
of the second;
then
there
exists
such a
point C
of the
segment, that no point of the
first class
is within (OS) and
none of the second within (AC).
It is manifest that A will belong to the first class, and B to
the
second, while C may
be
ascribed
to
either.
It
is the
presence
of
this
point
common
to
both,
that
makes
it
advisable to describe
the two
classes in a
negative, rather
than in a positive manner.
Theorem 1.
If AB and PQ be any two distances whereof
the second
is not
null, there will exist in the segment (AB)
a finite or null number n of points P
Jc possessing the following
properties
:
Suppose,
firstly, that AB < PQ then,
clearly, n = 0.
If,
however, AB == PQ then
11 = 1 and Px
is identical with B.
There remains the third case where AB > PQ.
Imagine the
theorem to be untrue.
We shall arrive at a contradiction as
follows.
Let
us
divide
all
points of the segment into two

24
CONGRUENT TRANSFORMATIONS

classes.
A point // shall belong to the
first class
if we may
find such a positive integer n that
the succession of points P& being taken as above.
All other
points of the segment shall be assigned to the second class.
It
is
clear that neither
class will be empty.
If H be a point
of the
first
class, and K one of the second, we cannot have
Ajmthin_(,4#), for then we should find AK = APn -}-PnK',
PnK < PQ
contrary
to
the
rule
of dichotomy.
We
have
therefore a cut of the type demanded by Axiom XVIII, and
a point of division 0.
Let D be such a point of (AC) that
l)d< PQ.
Then, as we may find n so large that PnD < PQ,
we
shall
either have PnC < PQ
or
else we
shall be able to
insert a point Pn+l
within (AC) making PTO+1 6
f < PQ.
If,
then, in the
first case we construct PM+1 , or in the second
Pw+2 3 ^ w^^ be a P ^ within (OB), as PnB > PQ, and this
involves a contradiction, for
it would require Pn+ i or Pn+2
to
belong
to
both
classes
at
once.
The
theorem
is
thus
proved.
It will be seen that this theorem
is merely a variation of
the axiom ofArchimedes,* which says, in non-technical language,
that
if a
sufficient number of equal lengths be laid off on a
line, any point of that line may be
surpassed.
We arc not
able to
state the principle in exactly this form, however, for
we cannot be sure that our space shall include points of the
type Pn in the extension of (AB) beyond B.
Theorem
2.
In any segment there
is a
single point whose
distances from the extremities are congruent.
The proof is left to the reader.
The point so found shall be called the middle point of the
* A good deal of attention has been given in recent years to this axiom.
For an account of the connexion
of Archimedes' axiom with the continuity
of the
scale, see
Stolz, 'Ueber das Axiom
des Archimedes,' Mathematiscfie
Annalen,
vol. xxxix, 1891.
Halsted, Rational Geometry (New York, 1904), has
shown
that a good deal of the subject of elementary geometry can be built
up without the Archimedian
assumption, which
accounts
for
the other-
wise somewhat obscure
title of his book.
Hilbert,
loc.
cit.,
Ch. IV, was
the
first writer to set up the theory
of area
independent
of continuity,
and Vahlen has shown,
loc.
cit., pp. 297-8, that volumes may be similarly
handled.
These questions are of primary importance in any work that deals
principally with the significance and independence of the axioms.
In our
present work we shall leave non-archimedian or discontinuous geometries
entirely aside, and that for the reason that their analytic treatment involves
either a mutilation
of the number
scale, or an adjunction of transfinite
elements thereto.
We shall, in
fact, make use of our axiom of continuity

If the distance ^L^ be null, the theorem
is trivial.
Other-
wise, suppose
it to be untrue.
Let us divide the
points of
(AB)
into
two
classes
according
to
the following scheme.
A point P1 shall belong to the first class if we may construct
a
congruent
distances
according
to
the
method
already
illustrated, reaching such a point Pn of (AB) that PnB> APl
;
all other points of (AB) shall be assigned to the second class.
B will clearly be a point of the second class, but every point
of (AB) at a lesser distance from A than a point of the first
class, will itself be a point of the
first
class.
We have thus
once more a cut as demanded by Axiom XVIII, and a point
of division Dl
; and this point is different from A.
Let us next assume that the number of successive distances
congruent to AD l which, by 1, may be marked in (AB) y is &,
and
let Dk be the
last extremity of the resulting segments,
so that DkB < ADj_.
Let D^-i be the other extremity of this
last
segment.
Suppose,
first, that k < n.
Let PQ bo such
a distance that ADl >7Q > D-k B.__^AiP^ be such a point of

Ph such a point of (ADk) that

is a contradiction, for
7c

and as P3 is a point of the first class, there should be at least
one more point of division Pk+r
Hence k^.n.
But k > n
leads to a similar contradiction.
For we might then find Q l
of the second class so that
(A

Then mark

successive
congruent
distances, reaching Q&_ 2 such a
point of (ADj^) that Q&_ 2-^-i >

and we may find a (&l)th point Qk _i.
But
i
1^ n and
this leads us
to
a
contradiction with
the
assumption that
Ql should be a point of the second class
;
i. e. k = n.
Lastly,
we shall find
that Dk and B
are
identical.
For otherwise
we might find Q l of the second class
so that nD^ < DnB
and marking n successive congruent distances reach Qn within
(DnB), impossible when Q l belongs to class two.
Our theorem
is thus entirely proved, and Dv is the point sought.
It will be convenient to write

We
are
at
last
in a
position
to introduce the concept of
number into our scale of distance magnitudes.

Suppose,
conversely, that

there exists such a distance AB' that qABf > pPQ.
Then in

will exist a distance having the measure - in terms of PQ.

let r be any irrational number, and let there be such a number
ry\ J ... 1
in
the
corresponding
upper
division
of
the
rational
number system that a distance qAB' > ((p+l)PQ) may be
found.
Then the cut in the number system will give us a cut
in the segment (AB'), as demanded by XVIII, and a point of
division B.
The numerical measure
of AB in terms of PQ
will clearly be r.
Theorem 6. If two distances, whereof the second is not null,
be given, there exists a unique numerical measure for the first
in terms of the second, and
if a distance be given, and there
exist a distance having a given numerical measure in terms

CONGRUENT TRANSFORMATIONS

thereof, there will exist a distance having any chosen smaller
numerical measure.
Theorem 7.
If two distances be congruent, their measures
in terms of any third distance are equal.
It will occasionally be convenient to write the measure of PQ
in the form MPQ.
Theorem 8.
If r > n and if distances rPQ and nPQ
exist,
then rPQ > nPQ.
When m and n are both rational, this comes immediately by
reducing
to a common denominator.
When one or both
of
these numbers
is
irrational, we may
find
a number in the
lower class of the larger which is larger than one in the upper
class of the smaller, and then apply I, 3.
Theorem 9.
If AB > CD, the measure of AB in terms of
any chosen not null distance
is greater than that of CD in
terms of the same distance.
This comes at once by reduction ad absurdum.
It
will
hereafter be
convenient
to
apply
the
categories,
congruent
greater and
less,
to
segments, when these apply
respectively
to
the distances of their extremities.
We may
similarly
speak
of
the
measure
of a segment
in terms
of
another
one.
Let us
notice that in combining segments or
distances, the associative, commutative, and distributive laws
of multiplication hold good
;
e. g.
r
- nPQ = n
- rPQ = rnPQ, n(AB + CD) = nAJt + nOD.
Notice, in particular, that the measure of a sum is the sum of
the measures.
Definition. The assemblage of all points of a segment, or of
all possible extensions beyond one extremity, shall be called
a
half-line.
The
other extremity
of the segment
shall
be
called the bound of the half-line.
A half-line bounded by A
and including a point B shall be written
| AB.
Notice that
every point of a line is the bound of two half-lines thereof.
Definition. A relation between two
sets of points (P) and
(Q) such that there is a one to one correspondence of distinct
points, and the distances of corresponding pairs of points are
in every case congruent, while the sum of two distances
is
carried
into a congruent sum,
is
called a congruent trans-
formation.
Notice that, by V, the assemblage of all congruent
transformations
form
a
group.
If,
further,
a
congruent
transformation be possible (P) to (Q), and there be two sets
of points (P
/
) and (Q') such that a congruent transformation

ii
CONGRUENT TRANSFORMATIONS
29
is possible from the
set (P) (P') to the set (Q) (Q') 9 then we
shall say that the congruent transformation from (P) to (Q)
has been enlarged to include the sets (P') and (Q').
It
is
evident
that a congruent transformation will carry
points of a segment, line, or half-line, into points of a segment,
line,
or
half-line
respectively.
It
will
also
carry coplanar
points
into
coplanar
points, and
be, in
fact, a collineation,
or
linear
transformation
as
defined
geometrically.
In
the
eighteenth chapter of the present work we shall see how the
properties of congruent figures may be
reached by defining
congruent transformations as a certain six-parameter collinea-
tion group.
AXIOM XIX. If a congruent transformation exist between
two
sets
of points,
to each half-line bounded by a point
of one set may be made to correspond a half-line bounded
by the corresponding point of the other set, in such wise that
the transformation may be enlarged
to include
all points
of these two
half-lines
at congruent distances from their
respective bounds.*
Theorem 10.
If a congruent transformation carry two chosen
points
into two other chosen points,
it may be enlarged to
include
all points
of their segments.
Theorem 11.
If
a
congruent
transformation
carry
three
non-collinear points into three other such points,
it may be
enlarged to include all points of their respective triangles.
Theorem 12.
If a congruent transformation carry four non-
coplanar points into four other such points, it may be enlarged
to include all points of their respective tetrahedra.
Definition. Two figures which
correspond in a congruent
transformation shall be
said to be congruent.
We shall assume hereafter that every congruent transforma-
tion with which we deal has been
enlarged to
the
greatest
possible extent.
Under these circumstances
:
Theorem 13.
If two
distinct points be
invariant under a
congruent
transformation,
the same
is
true of
all points of
their
line.
Theorem
14.
If
three
non-collinear
points
be
invariant
* The idea of enlarging a congruent transformation to include additional
points
is due to Pasch,
loc.
cit.
He merely assumes that
if any point be
adjoined to the one set, a corresponding point may be adjoined to the other.
We have to make a much clumsier assumption, and proceed more circum-
spectly, for fear of passing out of our limited region.

under a congruent
transformation, the same
is true
of
all
points of their plane.
Theorem 15. If four non-coplanar points be invariant under
a congruent transformation the
same
is true
of
all
points
of space.
Definition. The assemblage of all points of a plane on one
side
of a given
line, or on that given
line, shall be
called
a half-plane.
The
given
line
shall be
called the bound of
the half-plane.
Each line in a plane is thus the bound of two
half-planes thereof.
Suppose
that we have two
non- col linear
half-lines with
a common bound A.
Let B and C be two other points of
one-half-line, and B' and
(7' two points of the
other.
Then
by
Ch.
I,
16,
a
half-line bounded
by A
which
contains
a point of (BB') will also contain a point of (0(7'), and vice
versa.
We may
thus
divide
all
half-lines
of
this
plane,
bounded by
this
point,
into two
classes.
The assemblage
of
all
half-lines
which
contain
points
of segments
whose
extremities
lie
severally on
the two given
half-lines
shall
be called the interior angle
of, or between, the given half-
lines.
The
half-lines
themselves
shall be
called
the
sides
of the angle.
If the
half-lines be
| AB, \AC,
their
interior
angle may be indicated by %-.]BAC or $_ CAB.
The point A
shall be called the vertex of the angle.
Definition. The assemblage of all half-lines coplanar with
two
given
non-coil inear
half- lines,
and
bounded
by
the
common bound
of
the
latter,
but
not
belonging
to
their
interior angle, shall be
called the exterior angle of the two
half-lines.
The
definitions
for
sides and vertex
shall be as
before.
If no mention
be made
of
the words
interior
or
exterior we
shall
understand by
the word
angle,
interior
angle.
Notice that, by our definitions, the sides are a part of
the interior, but not of the exterior angle.
Let the reader also
show that
if a half-line
of an interior angle be taken, the
other half-line, collinear therewith, and having the same bound
belongs to the exterior angle.
Definition. The assemblage of all half-lines identical with
two
identical
half-lines,
shall be called their interior angle.
The given bound shall be the vertex, and the given half-lines
the sides of the angle.
This angle shall also be called a null
angle.
The assemblage of all half-lines with this bound, and
lying in any chosen plane through the identical
half-lines,
shall be called their exterior angle in this plane.
The defini-
tion of sides and vertex shall be as before.

CONGRUENT TRANSFORMATIONS

Definition. Two
collinear, but not
identical, half-lines of
common bound shall be said to be opposite.
Definition. The assemblage of all half-lines having as bound
the common bound of two opposite half-lines, and lying in
any
half-plane bounded by
the
line
of the
latter, shall be
called an angle
of the two
half-lines
in
that
plane.
The
definitions of sides and vertex shall be as usual.
We notice
that two
opposite
half-lines determine two angles in every
plane through their
line.
We have thus defined the angles of any two half-lines of
common bound.
The
exterior
angle of any two such half-
lines, when there
is one, shall be
called a re-entrant angle.
Any angle determined by two
opposite
half-lines
shall
be
called a straight angle.
As, by definition, two half-lines form
an angle when, and only when, they have a common bound,
we
shall
in future cease to mention this
fact.
Two angles
will
be
congruent, by
our
definition
of congruent
figures,
if there exist a congruent transformation of the sides of one
into the sides of the other, in so far as corresponding distances
actually
exist on
the corresponding
half-lines.
Every
half-
line of the interior or exterior angle will similarly be carried
into a corresponding half-line, or as much thereof as actually
exists and contains corresponding distances.
Definition.
The angles
of a
triangle
shall be those non-
re-entrant angles whose vertices are the vertices of the triangle,
and whose sides include the sides of the triangle.
Definition.
The
angle between a
half-line
including one
side
of a
triangle, and bounded at a chosen vertex, and the
opposite of the other half-line which goes to make the angle
of the triangle at that vertex, shall be called an exterior angle
of the
triangle.
Notice that there are
six of these, and that
they are not to be confused with the exterior angles of their
respective
sides.
Theorem 16.
If two triangles be so related that the sides of
one are congruent to those of the other, the same holds for the
angles.
This is an immediate result of 11.
The meanings of the words opposite and adjacent as applied
to sides and angles of a triangle are immediately evident, and
need not
be
defined.
There
can
also
be no ambiguity
in
speaking of sides including an angle.
Theorem 17. Two triangles are congruent
if two sides and
the included angle of one be respectively congruent to two
sides and the included angle of the
other.

The truth
of this
is at once evident when we
recall the
definition of congruent angles, and
12.
Theorem 18.
If two
sides of a triangle be congruent, the
opposite angles are congruent.
Such a triangle shall, naturally, be called isosceles.
Theorem 19.
If three half-lines
lie in the same half-plane
and have their common bound on
the
bound
of
this half-
plane;
then one belongs
to the interior angle of the other
two.
Let the half-lines be
| AB,
\ AC,
\ AD.
Connect B with H
and K, points of the opposite half-lines bounding this
half-
plane.
If
| -4(7,
AD contain points
of the same two
sides
of the
triangle BHK
the
theorem
is
at
once
evident;
if
one contain a point of (BH) and the other a point of (BK)<
then B belongs to
_ GAD.
Theorem 20.
If
| AB be a half-line of the interior 4^0AD,
then
| AC does not belong to the interior 4- BAD.
Definition. Two non-re-entrant angles
of the same
plane
with a common side, but no other common half-lines, shall be
said to be adjacent.
The angle bounded by their remaining
sides, which includes the common
side, shall be
called
their
sum.
It
is
clear
that
this
is,
in
fact,
their
logical
sum,
containing all common points.
Definition. An angle shall be said to be congruent to the
sum of two non-re-entrant angles, when it is congruent to the
sum of two adjacent angles, respectively congruent to them.
Definition.
Two angles congruent to two adjacent angles
whose sum
is a
straight angle
shall be
said
to be supple-
mentary.
Each shall be called the supplement of the other.
Definition. An angle which is congruent to its supplement
shall be called a right angle.
Definition. A triangle, one of whose angles is a right angle,
shall be called a right triangle.
Definition.
The
interior
angle formed by two
half-lines,
opposite
to
the
half-lines which
are
the
sides
of a given
interior angle, shall be called the vertical of that angle.
The
vertical
of a
straight
angle
will
be
the
other
half-plane,
coplanar therewith, and having the same bound.
Theorem 21.
If two points be at congruent distances from
two points coplanar with them, all points of the line of the
first two are at congruent distances from the latter two.

CONGRUENT TRANSFORMATIONS

For we may find a congruent transformation keeping the
former points invariant, while the latter are interchanged.
Theorem
22.
If
AA{
be
a
half-line
of
the
interior
$ BAA l9 then we cannot have a
congruent transformation
keeping
| AB invariant and carrying
| AA l into
| AA^.
We may suppose that A l and A
are at congruent distances
from A.
Let H be the point of the segment (A-^^A^)
equi-
distant from
A-, and
J./.
We may find a congruent trans-
formation carrying AA 1HA
}
/ into AA l'HA l
.
Let this take
the half-line
| AB into
| AC
(in the same
plane).
Then
if
1 AA
and
| AA{
be
taken
sufficiently
small, AA{
will
meet AB or AC as we see by
I.
16.
This will
involve a
contradiction, however, for
if D be the intersection, it is easy
to see that we
shall have
simultaneously DA l == ZM/ and
/)A l > DA^ or J^^i < -O^i'j for D
is unaltered by the con-
gruent transformation, while A l goes into A-[.
There
is one case whore this reasoning has to be modified,
namely, when
| AC and
| AB are opposite
half-lines, for here
I. 16 does not hold.
Let us notice, however, that we may
enlarge
our
transformation
to
include
the
4- BAA l
and
4-BAA^ respectively.
If
| ABl and
j ACl be two
half-lines
of the first angle, ACl being in the interior angle of 4- BAB^
,
to them will correspond
| AB^ and
| AC^ the latter being in
the
interior
angle
of 4-BAB^
while by
definition, corre-
sponding half-lines always determine congruent angles with
| AB.
If, then, we choose any half-line
| AL of the interior
4-BAA},
it
may
be
shown
that
we
may
find
two
corresponding
half-lines
| ALV
\ AL
{
' so situated that
| AL l
belongs to the interior ^b^BAL^ and 4~L^AL
is congruent
to
. LALV
The
proof
is
tedious,
and
depends
on
showing
that
as
a
result
of
our Axiom XVIII,
if in any
segment
the
points
be
paired
in
such
a way
that
the
extremities correspond, and the greater of two distances from
an extremity correspond to the greater of the two correspond-
ing
distances from
the
other
extremity,
then
there
is
one
self-corresponding
point.*
These
corresponding
half-lines
being found, we may apply the first part of our proof without
fear of mishap.
Theorem 23.

it

Theorem 24. An angle is congruent to its vertical.
We have merely to look at the congruent transformation
interchanging a side of one with a side of the other.
We see as a result of 24 that if a half-line
| AB make right
angles with the opposite half-lines
| -4(7,
| AC', the verticals
obtained by extending (AB) beyond A will be right angles
congruent
to the other two.
We
thus have four mutually
congruent right angles at the point A.
Under these circum-
stances we
shall
say that they are mutually perpendicular
there.
Theorem 25.
If two angles of a triangle be congruent, the
triangle is isosceles.
This is an immediate result of 18.
Given two non-re-entrant angles.
The first shall be said to
be greater than the second, when it
is congruent to the sum
of the second, and a not null angle.
The second shall under
these circumstances, and these alone, be said
to be
less than
the first.
As the assemblage of all congruent transformations
is a group, we see that the relations greater than, less than,
and congruent when applied to angles are mutually exclusive.
For
if we had two angles whereof the
first was both greater
than and less than the second, then we should have an angle
that would
be both
greater than and
less than
itself,
an
absurd result, as we see from 23.
We shall write > in place
of greater than, and <
for
less than, = means congruence.
Two angles between which there
exists one
of
these
three
relations shall be said to be comparable.
We shall later see
that any two angles
are
comparable.
The reason why we
cannot
at once
proceed
to
prove
this
fact,
is
that, so
far,
we are not very clear as to just what can be done with our
congruent transformations.
As for the a priori question of
comparableness, we have perfectly clear definitions of greater
than, less than, and equal as applied to infinite assemblages,
but are entirely in the dark as to whether when two such
assemblages are given, one of these relations must necessarily
hold.*
Theorem
26. An exterior angle of a triangle is comparable
with either of the opposite interior angles.
Let us take the triangle ABG, while D lies on the extension
of (BC) beyond
C,
Let E be the middle point of
(AG) and
let Df^meet^AB) in F.
If ~DE > RF
find
of (DE) so
that FE = EG.
Then we have
BAG congruent to 4-ECG

and
less
than
4-ECD.
If RE < EF we
have
&.BAC
greater than an angle congruent to 4- EGD.
Theorem 27. Two angles of a triangle are comparable.
For they are comparable to the same exterior angle.
Theorem
28.
If in any triangle one angle be greater than
a
second,
the
side
opposite
the
first
is
greater
than
that
opposite the second.
Evidently these
sides cannot be
congruent.
Let us then
have the triangle ABG where
. BAG >
2|L EGA.
We may,
by the definition of congruence, find such a point G
1 of (BG)
that %-Cj^AG
is congruent to %-C-^GA and hence (\A EE C^Cr.
It thus remains to show that AB < AG + G1 B.
Were such
not the
case, we might find Dl of (AB) so that AD 1 = AGV
and the problem reduces to comparing BCl and BJ\.
Now
in A BD1 C1 we have ^.BD^O^ the supplement
of ^AD1C1
which is congruent to 4^AG1D1 whose supplement is greater
than 4- B@iA
We have therefore returned to our original
problem,
this time, however, with a smaller triangle.
Now
this reduction process may be continued indefinitely, and
if
our original assumption be false, the inequalities must always
lie the same way.
Next notice
that, by our axiom of con-
tinuity, the points G^ of (BG) must tend to approach a point
G of that segment as a
limit, and similarly the points D$ of
(AB) tend to approach a limiting point, D.
If two points of
(AB) be taken indefinitely close to D the angle which they
determine
at any point of (BG)
other than B will become
indefinitely
small.
On the other hand
as Ct
- approaches C
f
,
2f_ APC$ will tend to increase, where P is any point of (AB)
other than
J5,
in which
case
the
angle
is
constant
This
shows that
(7, and by the same reasoning D, cannot be other
than B
; so that the difference between BGt and BDi can be
made as small as we please.
But, on the other hand
(BA ~~BG) =
Our theorem comes at once from this contradiction,
Theorem 29.
If two
sides of a triangle be not congruent,
the angle opposite the greater side is greater than that opposite
the lesser.
Theorem 30. One side of a triangle cannot be greater than
the sum of the other two.
Tfieorem 31.
The difference between two sides of a triangle
is less than the third side.
The proofs of these theorems are left to the reader.

Theorem 32.
Two
distinct
lines cannot
be coplanar with
a third, and perpendicular to
it at the same point.
Suppose, in fact, that we have AC and AD perpendicular to
BR at A.
We may assume AB = AB* so that by
I. 31 AD
will contain a single point E either of (CB) or of (CB').
For
definiteness,
let E belong
to
(Off).
Then take F on (BO),
which
is
congruent
to
(-#'(7),
so that
BF==~JE.
Hence
4~BB?F is congruent to %-B'BE and therefore congruent to
%-BffE\ which contradicts 23.*
Theorem 33.
The locus
of points in a plane at congruent
distances from two points thereof is the line through the middle
point of their segment perpendicular to their line.
Theorem 34. Two triangles are congruent if a side and two
adjacent angles of one be respectively congruent to a side and
two adjacent angles of the other.
Theorem 35.
Through any point of a given
line will pass
one line perpendicular to
it lying in any given plane through
that line.
Let A be the chosen point, and C a point in the plane, not
on the chosen line.
Let us take two such points B, B' on the
given line, that A
is the middle point of (Bff) and 11B' < OB,
Bff< Off.
If then CB =777?, AC
is the
line
required.
If
not,
lot us
suppose
that CB > CB'.
We may make a
cut
in
the
points
of (CB)
according
to the following principle.
A point P shall belong to the
first class
if no point of the
segment (PB) is at a distance from B greater than its distance
from
B',
all other points of (OB) shall belong to the second
class.
It
is clear that the requirements of Axiom XVIII are
fulfilled, and we have a point of division D.
We could not
have J)B < DB' t
for then we might, by
31, take E a point
of (DC)
so
very
near
to D
that
for
all
points P
of DE
PB < PB\ and this would be contrary to the law of the
cut.
In the same way we could not have DB > Dff.
Hence AD

the perpendicular required.

It
is
truly
astonishing how much geometers, ancient and modern, have worried over
this theorem.
Euclid puts
it as his eleventh axiom that
all right angles
are equal.
Many modern textbooks prove that all straight angles are equal ,
hence right angles are equal, as halves of equal things.
This
is not usually
sound, for
it is not clear by definition why a right angle
is half a straight
angle.
Others observe the angle of a fixed and a rotating line, and either
appeal explicitly to intuition, or to a vague continuity axiom.

of
intersection,
it
is perpendicular to every line
in their plane through that
point.
The proof given in the usual textbooks will hold.
Theorem 37.
All
lines
perpendicular
to a
given
line
at
a given point are coplanar.
Definition. The plane of all
perpendiculars
to a
line at a
point, shall be said
to be perpendicular
to that line at that
point.
Theorem 38. A congruent
transformation which keeps
all
points of a line invariant, will transform into itself every plane
perpendicular to that line.
It
is
also
clear
that
the locus of all
points
at congruent
distances from two points
is a plane.
Theorem 39. If P be a point within the triangle ABC and
there exist a distance congruent to AB + AC, then
To prove
this
let BP pass through D of (AC).
Then
as
AC > AD
a

AB + A~D>BP + PD.
As AS + AD > PJD there exists a dis-
tance

hence PD + DC > PC,

1 > RP + PC.
Theorem 40. Any two right angles are congruent.
Let
these
right
angles
be 4-AOC
and
.4'0'G".
We
may assume

of (AB) and
0' the
middle
point
of
(A'B') y
where OA=0'A'._WQ may
also
suppose
that
distances
exist congruent
to AC+CB and
to
AW + CFW.
Then^lC
Y > AO and AC/ > A*0'.
Lastly,_we
may assume that AC = AC/.
For if we had say, AC > A'C',
we might use our cut proceeding in (0(7).
A point P shall
belong to the first class, if no point of (OP) determines with A
a distance greater then A'C', otherwise
it shall belong to the
second class.
We find a point of division D, and see at once
that AD = A'C'.
Replacing
the
letter D by C

have
AC^AW, A ABC

ing any segment (AB) into any congruent segment (A'B') and

Theorem 42.
If
J. be a given
half-line, there will
exist
in any chosen half-plane bounded by OA a unique half-line
OS making the ^.AOB congruent to any chosen angle.
The proof of this theorem depends immediately upon the
preceding one.
Several
results
follo^ from
the
last
four
theorems.
To
begin with, any two angles are comparable, as we see at once
from 42.
We see also that our Axioms III-XIII and XVIII,
may
be
at once
translated into
the geometry
of the angle
if straight and re-entrant angles be excluded.
We may then
apply
to
angles system
of measurement
entirely analogous
to that applied to
distances.
An angle may be represented
unequivocally by a
single number,
in terms of any chosen
not null angle.
We may extend our system of comparison to
include straight and re-entrant angles as follows.
A straight
angle shall be looked upon as greater than every non-re-entrant
angle, and less than every re-entrant one.
Of two re-entrant
angles,
that one
shall
be
considered
the
less, whose corre-
sponding interior
angle
is the
greater.
A re-entrant angle
will be the logical sum of two non-re-entrant angles, and shall
have as a measure, the sum of their measures.
We have also found out a good deal about the congruent
group.
The principal facts are as follows
:
(a) A congruent transformation may be found to carry any
point into any other point.
(ft) A congruent transformation may be found to leave any
chosen point invariant, and carry any chosen
lino
through
this point, into any other such line.
(c) A
congruent
transformation may
be
found
to
leave
invariant any point, and any line through
it, but to carry
any plane through this line, into any other such plane.
(d)
If a point, a line through
it, and a plane through the
line
be
invariant, no further
infinitesimal congruent
trans-
formations are possible.
The
last assertion has
not been proved
in
full;
let the
reader show that if a point and a line through it be invariant,
there is only one congruent transformation of the line possible,
besides
the
identical
one, and
so
on.
The
essential
thing
is this.
We shall demonstrate at length in Ch. XVIII that
the congruent group
is completely determined by the require-
ment that
it shall be an analytic collineation group, satisfying
these four requirements.

that we have two
half-planes on
opposite
aides
of a plane a which contains
their common bound
I.
Every
segment whose extremities are one in each of these half-planes
will have a point in a, and, in
fact, all such points will
lie
in one half-plane of a bounded by
I, as may easily be shown
from the
special
case where two segments have a common
extremity.
Definition. Given two non-coplanar half-planes of common
bound.
The assemblage
of all half-planes with
this bound,
containing points of segments whose extremities lie severally
in
the two given
half-planes,
shall
be called their interior
dihedral angle,
or, more simply, their dihedral
angle.
The
assemblage
of all other half-planes with this bound shall be
called their exterior dihedral angle.
The two given half-planes
shall
be
called
the faces, and
their bound
the edge
of the
dihedral angle.
We may, by following the analogy of the plane, define null,
straight, and re-entrant dihedral angles.
The definition of the
dihedral
angles
of a tetrahedron
will
also be immediately
evident.
A plane perpendicular to the edge of a dihedral angle will
cut
the
faces
in two
half-lines
perpendicular
to
the
edge.
The
interior
(exterior) angle of these two shall be called a
plane angle of the interior (exterior) dihedral angle.
Theorem 43. Two plane angles of a dihedral angle are con-
gruent.
We
have
merely
to
take
the
congruent
transformation
which keeps invariant
all points of the plane whose points
are equidistant from the vertices of the plane angles.
Such
a transformation may properly be called a reflection in that
plane.
Theorem 44.
If two dihedral angles be congruent, any two
of their plane angles will be congruent, and conversely.
The proof is immediate.
Let us next notice that we may
measure any dihedral angle in terms of any other not null one,
and that
its measure
is
the measure
of
its
plane angle in
terms of the plane angle of the
latter.
Definition.
If the plane angle of a dihedral angle be a right
angle, the dihedral angle itself shall be called right, and the
planes
shall be said
to be mutually perpendicular.
Theorem, 45.
If a plane be perpendicular to each of two
other
planes, and
the three
be
concurrent,
then
the
first
plane
is
also perpendicular to the line of intersection of the
other two.

CHAPTER
III
THE THREE HYPOTHESES
IN the last chapter we discussed at some length the problem
of
comparing
distances
and
angles,
and
of
giving
them
numerical measures
in terms of known
units.
We did not
take up the question of the sum of the angles of a triangle,
and that shall be our next task.
The axioms so
far set up
are insufficient to determine whether this sum
shall, or shall
not, be congruent to the sum of two right angles, as we shall
amply
see by
elaborating
consistent
systems
of geometry
where
this sum
is
greater
than, equal
to, or
less than two
right
angles.
We
must
first,
however,
give
one
or two
theorems concerning the continuous change of distances and
angles.
Theorem
1.
If a point P of a segment (AB) may be taken
at as small a distance from A as desired, and G be any other
point, the it^ACP may be made less than any given angle.
If C be a point of AB the theorem
is trivial.
If not, we
may, by
III. 4,
find
| CD in the half-plane bounded by CA
which contains B, so that i-AQD
is congruent to the given
angle.
If then
| AB belong to the internal l(^.AGD, we have
4-.ACB
less than 4_ACD 9 and, a fortiori, 4_AGP<4-AGD.
If AD belong
to the internal %-ACB,
\ AD must contain a
point E of CAB, and if we take P within (AE), once more
4-AGP < 4_ACD.
Theorem
2.
If, in any triangle, one side and an adjacent
angle remain fixed, while the other side including this angle
may be diminished at will, then the external angle opposite
to the fixed side will take and retain a value differing from
that of the fixed angle by less than any assigned value.
Let the fixed
side be (AB), while G
is the variable vertex
within a fixed segment (BD).
We wish to show that
if BG
be taken sufficiently small, tfLACD will necessarily differ from
4-ABD by less than any chosen angle.
Let Bl be
the middle
point of (AB), and B2 the middle
point of
(Bj^B), while B3 is a point of the extension of (AB)
beyond B.
Through each of the points
JS1 , 52 , J53 construct
a
half-line bounded
thereby, and
lying
in that
half-plane.

bounded
by AB which
contains D, and
let
the angles
so
formed at
J315 J?2 , J53
all be congruent to i^ABD.
We may
certainly take EG so small that AC contains a point of each
of these half-lines, say
(715 (72 , C.6 respectively.
We may more-
over take BO
so
tiny
that^it
is
possible
to
extend (B^)
beyond C^ to Dl so that J^C^ CjjDr
AD^ will surely meet
B2
2 in a point
7)2
, when B^L\
is very
small, and as AG^
differs
infinitesimally from AB%, and hence exceeds AB by
FIG. 1.
a
finite amount,
it
is
greater than 2AGl which
differs
in-
finitesimally from 2AB19 or AB.
We may thus
find C" on
the extension of (ACJ beyond C^ so that AC^ = G^T'.
G' will
be at a small distance from
(7, and hence on the other side of
J?2D2 from A and jD
Let D^C' meet B2 D<2 at H2 .
We now
see that, with regard to the AAB1D 1
:> the external angle at
I)l
(i.e.
one
of
the
mutually
vertical
external
angles)
is
Dt congruent to (S1 l)1 C' + 4LC'i>1 l)s ), and

42
THE THREE HYPOTHESES
OH,
is congruent to 4-ABlDl , and, hence congruent to ^ABD.
The
^LC"jf)1 J?2 is the difference between ^S^D^ and %-B^H^
and
as H2 and D2 approach B2 as a limiting position, the
angles
determined by
J52 , D2 and D2 , //2 at every point in
space
decrease
together
towards
a
null
angle
as
a
limit.
Hence 1^-C'D^^
becomes
infinitesimal,
and
the
difference
between
.B1D1D2 and ^.ABD becomes
and
remains
in-
finitesimal.
But as ABl = B^B, and 4-AB^ and 4-B^BD
are congruent, we see similarly that the difference between
^B^D and ^LJ.JSZ) will become, and remain infinitesimal.
Lastly, the difference between 4-B^D and ^AGI) is 4-B^A
which
will, by our previous reasoning, become
infinitesimal
with B&.
The difference between ^.ABD and 4-ACD will
therefore become and remain less than any assigned angle.
Several corollaries follow immediately from this theorem.
Theorems.
If in any
triangle one
side and an adjacent
angle remain fixed, while the other side including this angle
becomes
infinitesimal, the sum
of the angles of this triangle
will differ infinitesimally from a straight angle.
Theorem 4.
If in any triangle
one
side and an
adjacent
angle remain fixed, while the other side including this angle
varies, then the measures of the third side, and of the variable
angles
will be continuous
functions of
tho measure
of the
variable side
first mentioned.
Of course a constant
is here included
as a special
case of
a continuous function.
Theorem 5.
If two lines AB,AG be perpendicular to HG9 then
all lines which contain .4 and points of BO are perpendicular
to BC\ and all points of BC are at congruent distances from A.
To prove this let us first notice that our A A BC is isosceles,
and AB
will
be
congruent
to
every
other
perpendicular
distance from A to BC.
Such a distance will be the distance
from A
to the middle point of (BC) and, in
fact, to every
point of BC whose distance from B may be expressed in the
77L
..
form ~ BG where m and n are
integers.
Now such points
will
lie as
close
as we
please
to every point of BC, hence
by
II.
31, no distance from A can
differ from ABy and no
angle so formed can, by III. 2, differ from a right angle.
Theorem 6.
If a set of lines perpendicular to a line I, meet
a line m, the distances of these points from a fixed point of m ,
and the angles so formed with m, will vary continuously with

in
THE THREE HYPOTHESES
43
the distances from a fixed point of
I to the intersections with
these perpendiculars.
The proof comes easily from 2 and 5.
Definition. Given four coplanar points A, B, (7, 1) so situated
that no
segment may
contain
points
within
three
of
the
segments (AB), (BO), (CD), (DA).
The assemblage of all points
of all segments whose extremities lie on these segments shall
be called a quadrilateral.
The given points
shall be
called
its
vertices, and
the
given
segments
its
sides.
The
foul-
internal
angles
4- DAB,
4_ ABC, 4- BCD,
4- CDA
shall
be
called
its
angles.
The
definitions
of
opposite
sides
and
opposite
vertices
are
obvious,
as
are
the
definitions
for
adjacent sides and
vertices.
Definition.
A
quadrilateral
with
right
angles
at
two
adjacent vertices
shall be
called
birectangular.
If
it have
three right angles
it shall be called trirectangular, and four
right angles
it shall be
called
a
rectangle.
Let
the reader
convince
himself
that, under our hypotheses, birectangular
and trirectangular quadrilaterals necessarily e^dst.
Definition. A birectangular quadrilateral whose
opposite
sides adjacent to the right angles are congruent, shall be said
to be isosceles.
Theorem 7.
Saccheri's.*
In an isosceles birectangular quad-
rilateral a line through the middle point of the side adjacent
to both
right
angles, which
is perpendicular to the
line of
that
side, will be perpendicular to the
line
of the opposite
side and pass through its middle point.
The other two angles
of the quadrilateral are mutually congruent.
Let
the quadrilateral
be ABCD, the
right angles having
their vertices at A and
B.
Then
the
perpendicular to Att
at E the middle point of (AB) will surely contain F point of
(CD).
It
will
be
easy
to
pass a
plane through
this
line
perpendicular to the plane of the quadrilateral, and by taking
a
reflection
in
this
latter
plane,
the
quadrilateral
will
be
transformed into itself, the opposite sides being interchanged.
This theorem may be more briefly stated by saying that

The theorem given above covers Sacckeri's theorems 1 and 2 on p. 50
of the last-named work.
Saccheri's
is the first systematic attempt of which
we have a record to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, and proceeds according
to the modern method of assuming the postulate untrue.
He builded better
than he knew, however, for the system so constructed is self-consistent, and
not inconsistent, as he attempted to show.

THE THREE HYPOTHESES
OH.
this line divides the quadrilateral into two mutually congruent
trirectangular ones.
Theorem 8. In a rectangle the opposite sides are mutually
congruent, and any isosceles birectangular quadrilateral whose
opposite sides are mutually congruent is necessarily a rectangle.
TJteorewi 9.
If there exist a single rectangle, every isosceles
birectangular quadrilateral is a rectangle.
Let ABCD
be
the
rectangle.
The
line
perpendicular
to
AB
at
the
middle
point
of (AB)
will
divide
it
into two
smaller rectangles.
Continuing this process we see that we
can construct a rectangle whose adjacent sides may have any
_
__
-
measures that can be indicated in the form
AB,
~
t
- AC,
i
<
*
provided,
of
course, that
the
distances
so
called
for
exist
simultaneously
on
the
sides
of
a
birectangular
isosceles
quadrilateral.
Distances
so
indicated
will
be
everywhere
dense on any line, hence, by 6 we may construct a rectangle
having as one of
its
sides one of the congruent sides of any
isosceles birectangular quadrilateral, and hence, by a repetition
of the .same
process, a rectangle which
is identical with this
quadrilateral.
All isosceles birectangular quadrilaterals, and
all trirectangular quadrilaterals are under the present circum-
stances rectangles.
Be it noticed that, under the present hypothesis, Theorem 5
is superfluous.
Theorem 10.
If there exist a single right triangle the sum
of whose angles
is congruent to a straight angle, the same is
true of every right triangle.
Let A ABC be
the given
triangle, the
right
angle being
2jL ACB so that the sum of the other two angles is congruent
to a right angle.
Let A A'B'G' be any other right triangle,
the right angle being
^.^I'C'JB'.
We have to prove that the
sum of its remaining angles also is congruent to a right angle.
We see that
both it^ABC and ll^BAG are
less than
right
angles, hence there will exist such a point E of (AB) that
. EAC and 4. EGA
are congruent.
Then
. EBC =
. ECU
since 4- ACB
is congruent to the sum of i^EAG and 4- EBC.
If D and F be the middle points of (BC) and (AC) respec-
tively,
as &EAG and AEBC
are
isosceles, we have,
in
the
quadrilateral EDGF right angles at D, 0, and F.
The angle
at E is also a right angle, for it is one half the straight angle,
4-AEB, hence 4-EDGF is a rectangle.
Passing now to the
we
see
that
the
perpendicular
to A'C' at F'
the

in
THE THREE HYPOTHESES
45
middle point of (A'C'), will meet (A'B') in E\ and the per-
pendicular
to ETF' at E'
will meet
(_S'C")
in
D'.
But, by
an easy modification of
9, as there
exists one
rectangle, the
trirectangular quadrilateral E'F'D'C'
is
also a rectangle.
It
is
clear that 4-D'E
fB
f = 4-D'E'C' since 4-F'E'D'
is a right
angle and 4-F'R'A' = j-FE'C'.
Then kC'E'R
is isosceles
like &A'EC
f
.
From
this
conies immediately that
the sum
of i^E'R'C' and i^E'A
fC
r
is congruent
to a right angle, as
we wished to show.
Thewem 11.
If there exist any right triangle where the
sum of the angles
is
less than a straight angle, the same
is
true of all right triangles.
We see the truth of this by continuity.
For we may pass
from any right triangle to any other by means of a continuous
change of first the one, and then the other of the sides which
include the right angle.
In this change, by 2, the sum of the
angles
will
either remain
constant,
or change
continuously,
but may never become congruent to the sum
of two
right
angles, hence it must always remain less than that sum.
Theorem 12.
If there exist a right triangle where the sum
of the angles
is greater than two right angles, the same
is
true of every right triangle.
This comes immediately by reductlo ad absurditm.
Theorem 13.
If there exist any triangle where the sum of
the angles is less than (congruent to) a straight angle, then in
every triangle the sum of the angles
is less than (congruent
to) a straight angle.
Let
us
notice,
to
begin
with,
that
our
given AABd
must have at least two angles, say 4-ABC and ^.BAO which
are less than right angles.
At each point of (AB) there will
be a perpendicular
to AB
(in the plane
BO).
If two
of
these
perpendiculars
intersect,
all
will, by
5, pass through
this point, and a line hence to C will surely be perpendicular
to AB.
If no
two
of
the
perpendiculars
intersect,
then,
clearly, some will meet (AC)
and
some (BG).
A cut
will
thus be determined among the points of (AB), and, by XVIII,
we
shall find a point of division D.
It
is at once evident
that the perpendicular to AB at D will pass through 0.
In
every
case we may, therefore, divide our
19 triangle into two
right triangles.
In one of these the sum of the angles must
surely be
less than (congruent to) a straight
angle, and the
same will hold
for every right triangle.
Next observe that
there can, under our present circumstances, exist no triangle
with two angles congruent
to, or greater than right angles.

46
THE THREE HYPOTHESES
CH.
Hence every triangle can be divided into two right triangles
as we have just done.
In each of these triangles, the sum of
the angles
is less than (congruent to) a straight angle, hence
in
the triangle chosen, the sum
of the
angles
is
less than
(congruent to) a straight angle.
Theorem
14.
If
there
exist any triangle where
the sum
of the angles is greater than a straight angle, the same will
be true of every triangle.
This comes at once by reductio ad absurdum.
We have now reached the fundamental fact that the sum of
the
angles
of a
single
triangle
will
determine
the
nature
of the sum of the angles
of every
triangle.
Let us
set the
various possible assumptions in evidence.
The assumption that there exists a single triangle, the sum
of whose angles is congruent to a straight angle is called the
Euclidean or Parabolic hypothesis.*
The assumption that there
exists
a
triangle,
the sum
of
whose
angles
is
less
than
a
straight
angle
is
called
the
Lobatcheiuskian or hyperbolic, hypothesis, f
The assumption that there
exists a
triangle,
the sum
of
whose angles
is greater than a straight angle,
is
called the
Riemannian or elliptic hypothesis.^
Only under
the
elliptic hypothesis
can
two
intersecting
lines be perpendicular to a third line coplanar with them.
Definition.
The difference between the sum of the angles of
a triangle, and a straight angle shall be called the discrepancy
of the triangle.
Theorem 15.
If in any triangle a line be drawn from one
vertex
to a
point of the
opposite
side, the sum of the
dis-
crepancies
of
the
resulting
triangles
is
congruent
to
the
discrepancy of the given triangle.
* There will exist, of course, numerous geometries, other than those which
we give in the following pages, where the sum of the angles of a triangle is
still congruent
to a straight angle,
e. g. those lacking our strong axiom of
continuity.

who speaks of it in a letter to Bolyai written in 1799.

THE THKEE HYPOTHESES
47
The
proof
is
immediate.
Notice,
hence,
that
if
in any
triangle, one angle remain constant, while one or both of the
other vertices tend to approach the vertex of the fixed angle,
along fixed
lines, the discrepancy of the
triangle, when not
zero, will diminish towards zero as a limit.
We shall make
this more clear by saying
Theorem 16.
If, in any
triangle, one vertex remain fixed,
the other
vertices lying on
fixed lines through
it, and
if a
second vertex may be made to come as near to the fixed vertex
as may be
desired, while the
third vertex does not tend to
recede indefinitely, then the discrepancy may be made less
than any assigned angle.
Theorem 17.
If in any triangle one side may be made less
than any assigned segment, while neither of the other sides
becomes indefinitely large, the discrepancy may be made less
than any assigned angle.
If neither angle adjacent to the diminishing side tend to
approach a straight angle as a limit,
it will remain less than
some non-re-entrant
angle, and 16
will
apply to
all
such
angles simultaneously.
If it do tend to approach a straight
angle, let the diminishing side be (AB), while
.#4(7 tends
to approach a straight angle.
Then, as neither BO nor AC
becomes indefinitely great, we see that A must be very close
to some
point
of the extension of (AB) beyond A, or to A
itself.
If C do not approach A, we may apply 1 to show that
^AGB becomes infinitesimal.
If C do aroach
pproach A we may
take I) the middle point of (AC) and extend (BD) to E beyond
D
so
that DE == EB.
Then we may apply
Euclid's own
proof* that the
exterior angle of a triangle
is greater than
either opposite interior one, so that the
exterior angle at A
which is infinitesimal, is yet greater than 4-ACB.
Theorem 18.
If, in any system of triangles, one side of each
may
be made
less
than
any
assigned
segment,
all
thus
diminishing
together,
while
no
side
becomes
indefinitely
great, the geometry of these triangles may be made to differ
from the geometry of the euclidean hypothesis by as little as
may be desired.
A specious, if loose, way of stating this theorem
is to say
that in the infinitesimal domain, we have euclidean geometry.f
* Euclid, Book I, Proposition 16.
( This theorem, loosely proved, is taken as the basis of a number of works
on non-euclidean geometry, which start in the infinitesimal domain, and
work to the finite by integration.

CHAPTER [V
THE INTRODUCTION OF TRIGONOMETRIC
FORMULAE
THE
first fundamental question with which we shall have
to
deal
in
this
chapter
is the
following.
Suppose that we
have an
isosceles, birectangular
quadrilateral A BCD, whose
right angles are
at A and
B.
Suppose,
further,
that AB
becomes infinitesimally small, AD remaining constant
; what
will be the limit of the fraction
J^ where M XT means the
MAB
measure of XY in terms of some convenient unit.*
But, first
of all, we must convince ourselves, that, when AD
is given
we may always construct a suitable quadrilateral
; secondly,
and most important, we must show that a definite limit does
necessarily exist
for this ratio, as AB decreases towards the
null distance.
Theorem 1.
If AD and AX be two mutually perpendicular
lines we may find such a point B on either half of AX bounded
by A, that, a line being drawn perpendicular to AB at any
point P of (AB) we may find on the half thereof bounded by
P, which lies in the same half-plane bounded by AB as does D,
a point whose distance from P is greater than AD.
Let E be a point of the extension of (A D) beyond D.
Draw
a
line there perpendicular to AD.
If B be a point of AX
very
close
to
-4, and
if a
line
perpendicular
to AB at P
of (AB), meet the perpendicular at E at a point Q, PQ differs
but little from AE> and, hence, is greater than AD.
* The general treatment, and several of the actual proofs in this chapter
are taken directly from G<3rard ? La geometric non-cuclidienne, Paris, 1892.
It has
been possible to shorten some of his work by the consideration that we have
euclidean geometry in the infinitesimal domain.
On the other hand, several
important points are omitted by him.
There
is no proof that the required
limit does actually exist, and worse still, he gives no proof that the resulting
function of M AD is necessarily continuous, thereby rendering valueless his
solution of its functional equation.

OH. iv
TRIGONOMETRIC FORMULAE
49
The net result of theorem
1
is
this.
If AD be given, and
the right 2jLDAXy any point of AX very near to A may be
taken as the vertex of a second
right angle of an
isosceles
birectangular
quadrilateral, having A
as
the vertex
of one
right angle, and (AD) as one of the congruent sides.
Definition. We
v shall
say that
a
distance may
be made
infinitesimal compared with a
second
distance,
if the
ratio
of the measure of the first to that of the second may be made
less than any assigned value.
Theorem 2.
If in a triangle whereof one angle
is constant,
a second
angle may be made as small
as
desired,
the
side
opposite this angle will be infinitesimal compared to the other
sides of the triangle.
Suppose that we have, in fact, A PQR with ^LPQjR fixed,
while 4-PRQ becomes
infinitesimal.
It
is
clear
that
one
of the angles &.PQR or 2(L QPR must be greater than a right
angle.
Suppose
it
be ^QPR.
Then,
by
hypothesis,
no
matter how large a positive integer n may be, I may find such
positions for P and R, that n points Qi may be found on
j PQ
so that $-PRQ~4-QRQi = 4-QkRQk+i> yet t-QRQn
is
less
than any chosen angle.
Now if RQ remain constantly greater
than
a
given
not
null
distance,
the
theorem
is
perfectly
evident.
If, on the other hand, RQ decrease indefinitely, we
may find S on
| PQ but not in (PQ), so that QR = QS.
Then,
as geometry in the infinitesimal domain obeys the euclidean
hypothesis, tf^QRS will
differ
infinitesimally from
one
half
4-PQR.
If, then, we require 4-QRQn ^
^e ^css ^nan
named amount, Qn
will be within
(Q$), and PQ <
__
^
__
and PQ < - QR.
A
similar
proof
holds when $~PQR
is
greater than a right angle.
It will follow, as a corollary, that
if in any triangle, one
angle become infinitesimal, and
neither
of the other
angles
approaches a straight angle as a limit, then the side opposite
the
infinitesimal
angle
becomes
infinitesimal
as
compared
with either of the other
sides.
Theorem 3.
If in an
isosceles
birectangular
quadrilateral,
the congruent sides remain constant in value, while the side
adjacent
to
the two
right angles
decreases
indefinitely,
the
ratio of the measures of this and the opposite side approaches
a definite limit.
It will save circumlocution and involve no serious confusion
if, during the rest of this chapter, we speak of the ratio of two

write
such a

simply

Let us
then
take
the
isosceles

birectangular quadrilateral A'ABB', the right angles having
their vertices at A and B.
Let us imagine that A and A' are
fixed points, while B is on a fixed line at a very small distance
from A.
Let G be the middle point of (AB), and
let
the
perpendicular
to AB
at G meet
(A'B')
at
C",
which, by
Saccheri's theorem,
is the middle point of (AB).
Now, by

as AC

In the other cases it
is a variable depending on the measure
of AA'.
If this measure be

Let us next show that the function

Take

We

its
functional

Let x be the measure of AC,
(x

and
(x + y) that of AG^

where
(7 and
(7T are points within
(AC2).
Take a corresponding set of distances upon a line near
by, BD = AC; SS1 = Z^; BD., = AL\ while
| J.C and
| J5D
are in the same half-plane bounded by AB and perpendicular
thereto.
We know, by
1, that this construction
is
possible.
We
shall
presently
suppose AB
to
be
infinitesimal.
The
perpendicular to CD at C will meet CZD2 and G^D^ in P and R
respectively, while the perpendicular to CD at D will meet
these lines at Q and & ;
the four last-named points wilJ surely
exist,
if AB be very tiny.
4-CC2P and ^LC^jR

differ

find
that
it
gives
the
radius
of
a
sphere
(in
our
usual
euclidean
geometry)
upon
which
the
non-euclidean

may be developed.
We
shall,
therefore,
define the constant

as
the Medsure

little or no gain

to calculate another limit, that of the
ratio
of

simultaneously

a

Let
us,
then,
suppose
that
we

a

constant.

if & be the measure of the

the

that

of

us

Take JF on

these points will
certainly exist if OF be very small.
Connect F and B by a line

pendicular to

points also are sure to exist, if OF be small enough.
C will

TRIGONOMETRIC FORMULAE
55
Let us not fail to notice that since ^L-4jB(7 is a right angle
we have, by III. 17,
lim. = = cos (~
6 ) = sin 9.
(3)
The extension of these functions to angles whose measures
are greater than ~ will afford no
difficulty,
for, on the one
hand, the
defining
series
remains
convergent,
and, on
the
other,
the
geometric
extension may be
effected
as
in
the
elementary books.
Our next task
is a most serious and fundamental one, to
find the relations which connect the measures and sides and
angles
of a
right
triangle.
Let
this
be
the A ABC
with
-ABC as
its right angle.
Let the measure of ^.BAG be
\(r
while that of 4-BGA
is 0.
We shall assume that both ^ and
are
less than
~,
an obvious
necessity under the
euclidean
or hyperbolic hypothesis, while under the
elliptic, such
will
still be the case
if the sides of the triangle be not large, and
the
case where
the
inequalities do not hold may be easily
treated from the cases where they do.
Let us also call a, b, c
the measures of BC, GA, AB respectively.
We now make rather an elaborate construction.*
Take B1
in (AB)
as
near
to B as desired, and J^ on the extension
of
(AB)
beyond
A,
so
that
A^A = B^B,
and
construct
AA 1 B1 GI = AABC, G1 lying not far from
(7;
a construction
which, by 1, is surely possible
if BB1 be small enough.
Let
BlCl meet (AC)
at
<72
.
4-C&C will
differ but
little from
$-.BCA, and we may draw G1C3 perpendicular to CC%, where
Ca is a point of (CG^).
Let us next find A2 on the extension
of (AC) beyond A so that A%A = GZC and B2 on the extension
of (Cj^Bt) beyond B% so that B^2 = CjC/g, which
is certainly
possible
as 6^6^
is very small.
Draw A^B2
.
We saw that
^_(71 (72 (7 will differ from i^EGA by an infinitesimal (as BtB
decreases) and &-CClBl will approach a right angle as a limit.
We thus get two approximate
expressions
for
sin# whose
comparison yields

a

CHAPTER V
ANALYTIC FORMULAE
AT the beginning
of Chapter I we posited the existence
of two undefined objects, points and distances.
Between the
two
existed the
relation
that
the
existence
of two
points
implied
the existence
of a single
object, their distance.
In
this relation the two points entered symmetrically.
These
concepts
may
be
further
sharpened
as
follows.
Leaving
aside
the
trivial
case of
the
null
distance,
let us
imagine that a distinction
is made between the two points,
the one being called the
initial and the other the terminal
point.
The concept distance, where this distinction
is made
between the two points shall be called a directed distance,
or, more
specifically, the
directed
distance from
the
initial
to the
terminal
point.
Any
not
null
distance
will,
thus,
determine two directed distances.
The directed distance from
A
to 5
shall be
written AB.
The
relations
congruent
to
greater than, and
less
than, when
applied
to
directed
dis-
tances, shall mean that the corresponding distances have these
relations.
Suppose that we have two congruent segments (AB) and
(A'B') of the same line.
It may be that a congruent trans-
formation which carries the
line
into
itself, and transforms
A and B into A' and B', also transforms A
f into A.
In this
case
the middle
point of (AA
f
)
will remain
invariant, the
extremities of every segment having this middle point will
be
interchanged.
Such a
transformation
shall
be
called
a
reflection
in
this
middle
point.
Conversely, we
easily
see
that a congruent transformation whereby A
goes
into A',
and one other point of (A A') also goes into a point of that
segment, is a reflection in the middle point of the segment.
There are, however, other congruent transformations of the
line into
itself besides reflections.
For
if A go into A\ and
any point of (AA
f
) go into a point not of (AA')> then A will
be the only point of (AA') which goes into a point thereof,
there
will be no invariant
point on the
line, and we have
a different form of congruent transformation called a transla-
tion.
It is at once evident that every congruent transformation

CH.V
ANALYTIC FORMULAE
63
of the
line into
itself
is either a
reflection or a translation.
The inverse of a translation is another translation
; the inverse
of a reflection is the reflection itself.
Theorem 1. The product of two translations is a translation.
The assemblage of all translations is a group.
We see, to begin with, that every congruent transformation
has
an
inverse.
This
premised,
suppose
that we
have
a
translation whereby A goes into A', and a second whereby
A' goes
into
A".
We
wish
to show
that
the product
of
these two
is not a reflection.
Suppose, in fact, that it were.
A point Pl of (AA'
f
)
close
to A must then go into another
point P3 of (AA") close to A".
If A' be a point of (A A"), the
first translation
will carry Pl into P3 a point of (A'A") y and
as P3
is
also a point
of (A'A") the second transformation
would
be
a
reflection, and
not a
translation.
If A
were
a point
of (A'A"), P2 would be a point of (AA'), and hence
of (A'A")> leading to the same fallacy.
If A" were a point of
(AA') i P2 would belong to the extension of (A'A") beyond A',
and P3 would belong to (A'A") and not to (AA").
Let
the reader show that the product of a
reflection and
a translation
is
a
reflection, and
that the product of two
reflections
is a translation.
Definition. Two congruent directed distances of the same
line shall be
said
to have the same
sense,
if the congruent
transformation which carries the
initial and terminal points
of the one into the initial and terminal points of the other be
a
translation.
They
shall be
said
to have
opposite
senses
if this transformation be a reflection.
The following theorem
is obvious
Theorem 2.
The two
directed
distances
determined by a
given distance have opposite
senses.
Suppose, next, that we have two non-congruent directed
distances AB, A'C' upon the same
line,
so that A'C' > AB.
There will then (XIII) be a single such point ff of (A'C') that
AB = A'B
f
.
If then, AB and A B' have the same sense, we
shall
also say
that AB and A'C' have
the same
sense,
or
like
senses.
Otherwise, they
shall
be
said to have opposite
senses.
The group theorem for translations gives at once
Theorem 3.
Two
directed
distances
which
have
like
or
opposite senses to a third, have
like senses to one another,
and
if two directed distances have
like senses, a sense
like
(opposite) to that of one
is like (opposite) to that of the other,

64
ANALYTIC FORMULAE
OH.
while
if they have
opposite
senses, a
sense
like
(opposite)
to that of one is opposite (like) to that of the other.
Let us now make suitable conventions for the measurement
of directed
distances.
We
shall take for the absolute value
of the measure
of a
directed
distance,
the measure
of the
corresponding
distance.
Opposite
directed
distances of the
same
line shall have measures with opposite algebraic signs.
If, then, we assign the measure for a single directed distance
of a
line,
that
of every
other
directed
distance
thereof
is
uniquely determined.
If, further, we choose a fixed origin D
upon
a
line and a
fixed
unit
for
directed
distances, every
point P of the line will be completely determined by a single
coordinate
>
.
MOP
x = sin

In an entirely similar spirit we may enlarge our concepts of
angle, and dihedral
angle,
to directed angle.
We choose an
initial and
a
terminal
side
or
face, and define as
rotations
a certain one parameter, group
of congruent transformation
which keep
the vertex
or edge
invariant.
We thus
arrive
at the concept for sense of an angle, and set up a coordinate
system for half-lines or half-planes of common bound.
If in
the %~ABO, AH be taken as initial side, the resulting directed
angle shall be written 4-ABC.
We have at last elaborated all of the machinery necessary
to set up a coordinate system in the plane, and nearly all that
is necessary to set up coordinates in space.
Let us begin with
the plane, and choose two half-lines
| OJT,
| OF making a right
angle.
Their
lines
shall naturally
be called the coordinate
axes, while
is the origin.
Let P be any point of the plane,
the measure of OP being p, while those of

are a and
ft respectively.

What
shall we say as
to the signs to be attached to the
radicals appearing in these denominators ?
In the hyperbolic
case
co is essentially positive, so that the radical must have the
same sign as XQ
.
In the elliptic case it is not possible to have
two points, one with the coordinates
,
?;,
co and the other with
the coordinates
,

-co, for their distance would be
/CTT,
and the opposite angle of every triangle containing them both
would
be
straight,
i.e.
they might
be
connected by many
straight
lines.
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
not
possible
that
7;,
co and
f,
77, -co should refer to the same point, for
then
that
point would
determine
with
itself two
distinct
distances, which
is contrary
to Axiom
II.
Hence, in every
case, the radical must have a well-defined sign in order that
equations should give a point of our space.

Should we seek the measures of directed

Wo

These angles are
not directed, but this will cause no inconvenience, as we shall
introduce them merely through the
expressions
cos a,
cos/3,
cos y.
These shall be called the direction cosines of the half-
line,
shall be the
origin, and OX, OF, OZ the coordinate
axes, while the planes determined by them are the coordinate
planes.
Take a second half-line

cos a', cos /3', cos y'.
We shall imagine that OP and OP' are

Here, as in the case of the plane, there is no ambiguity arising
from the double sign of the radical.
There
is, however, one
modification which we
shall
occasionally make.
We
see,
in fact, that in the hyperbolic case, since &2 <

,
?/,
a> are
real, we must have (xx) < 0, and x
is a pure imaginary.
To
remedy this let us write

X^ = &15 X% = #2 J

A point will now have
real
coordinates.
This
distinction
between
coordinates
(x) and
coordinates
(x)
shall
be con-
sistently maintained in the hyperbolic case.
The cosine of the measure of distance of two points (x) and
(y) is easily found.
We see at once that we shall have

Let us now see what effect a congruent transformation will
have upon our coordinates.
First take
a congruent
trans-
formation keeping the origin invariant.
We see at once that
the new direction cosines, and so the new coordinates
(x'), will
be linear functions of the old ones
;
for a plane through the
origin will be characterized by a linear relation connecting
the direction cosines of the half-lines with that bound.
The
variables
,
17, f are thus linearly transformed in such a way
that
2 4- 77
2 -f f
2 has a constant value, while
o>
is unaltered,
Hence xQ9 xl
,
oc2 , #3 are linearly transformed so that (xx) is an
invariant
(relative),
i.e. they are subjected to an orthogonal
substitution.
Let us next suppose that we have a congruent transforma-
tion which carries the planes
=
and
r; =
into themselves,
and
every
half-plane with
this
axis
as
bound
into
itself.
The assemblage of all such transformations will form a one-
parameter group, and this group may be represented by

We
see,

that by
this
transformation every point
receives
just
the
coordinates
that
it would
obtain
by
a
translation of the axis OZ into
itself through a distance
d,
so enlarged as to carry into
itself every half-plane through
that
axis.
Once more wo
find
that, in the coordinates

this will be an orthogonal substitution.
Now,
lastly, every
congruent
transformation of space may be compounded out
of transformations of these two types.
Hence
:
Theorem
5.
Every congruent
transformation
of
space
is
represented by an orthogonal substitution in the homogeneous
variables #
: xl
: x2
: x3
.
In Chapter VIII we shall make a detailed study of these
congruent transformations.
For the present, lot us begin by
noticing that the coordinate planes have linear equations, and
as we may pass from
one
of these
to any other plane by
linear transformations,
so
the
equation
of any
plane may
be written
We
see
that
(xy),
(ux),
(uv)
are
concomitants
of every
congruent
transformation, and we
shall
use
them
to
find
expressions for the distance from a point to a plane and the
angle between two
planes.
The
existence
of the former of
these
quantities
is contingent upon the existence of a point
in the plane determining with the given point a line perpen-
dicular to the plane.
Let the plane (u) be that which connects the axis xl = x2 =
with
the
point
(y).
Its
equation
is
y2 xi
2/1^2 = 0.
The
cosines of the angles which this makes with the plane v1 x1=
are the x% direction
cosines
of the two
half-lines
of OP.
If
then, the measure of the angle be
0, we have
COS
= -fJiL== =
^
= -JL^.
But both sides of this equation are absolute invariants for all
congruent transformations.
Hence, we may write, in general
:
~~
V(uu) V(yv)
'
We find the distance from a point to a plane in the same
way.
Let the point be
(x) and d the distance thence to the
point where a perpendicular to the plane ul x1 =
meets
it,
this
being, by definition, the distance from
the point
to the

The sign of </(xx) is determined.
As for that of
-v/(uu), by
reversing it, we get opposite directed distances of the same line.
We have now reached
the end
of the
first stage of our
journey.
Our system of axioms has given us a large body
of elementary
doctrine,
a
system
of
trigonometry, and
a
system of analytic geometry wherein the fundamental metrical
invariants are easily expressed.
All of these things will be of
use
later.
At present our task is
different.
We must show
that the system of axioms which has carried us safely so far,
will not break down later;
i.e. that these axioms are essen-
tially compatible. We must also grapple with a disadvantage
which has weighed heavily upon us from the start, rendering
trebly difficult many a proof and definition.
In Axiom XI we
assumed that any segment might be extended beyond either
extremity.
Yes, but how far may it be so extended ?
This
question we have not attempted to answer, but have
dealt
with the geometry of such a region as the inside of a sphere,
not including the surface.
In fact, had we assumed that every
segment might be extended a given amount, we should have
run into a difficulty, for in elliptic space no distance may have
a measure kir under our axioms.
The matter may
be
otherwise
stated.
Every
point
will
have a set of coordinates in our system.
What is the extreme
limit of possibility for making points correspond to coordinate
sets, and what meaning
shall we attach
to
coordinates
to
which no point corresponds?
We must also adjoin the com-
plex domain for coordinates, and give a new interpretation to
our fundamental formulae
(12),
(13), (14) covering the most
general
case.
Then only
shall we be
able to continue our
subject in the broadest and most
scientific
spirit.

CHAPTER VI
CONSISTENCY A SIGNIFICANCE OF THE AXIOMS
THE
first fundamental question
suggested
at the close of
the
last
chapter was
this.
How
shall we show that those
assumptions
which we
made
at
the
outset
are,
in
truth,
mutually consistent ?
We need not here go into that elusive
question which
bothers
the modern
student
of pure
logic,
namely, whether any set of assumptions can ever be shown
to
be
consistent,
All that we
shall undertake to do
is
to
point to familiar sets of objects which do actually
fulfil our
fundamental laws.
Let us begin with the geometry of the euclidean hypothesis,
and take as points any class of objects which may be put into
one
to one correspondence with
all triads of values of three
real independent variables
x,
y>
z.
By the distance
of two
points we shall mean the positive value of the expression
The sum of two distances shall be defined in the arithmetical
sense.
It
is a perfectly straightforward piece of algebra to
bhow that such a system of objects will obey all of our axioms
and the euclidean hypothesis
;
hence the consistency of our
axioms
rests upon the
consistency
of
the number
system,
and
that we may take
as
indubitable.
Be
it noticed that
we have another system
of objects which obey
all
of our
axioms
if we make the further assumption that
The net result, so far, is this.
If we take our fundamental
assumptions and
the
euclidean
hypothesis, points and
dis-
tances may
be
put
into
one
to
one
correspondence
with
expressions of the above types
; and, conversely, any system
of geometry corresponding to these formulae
will be of the
euclidean
type.
The elementary geometry of Euclid
fulfils
these
conditions.
In what
immediately
follows we
shall
assume this geometry as known, and employ its terminology.
Let us now exhibit the existence of a system of geometry
obeying the
hyperbolic
hypothesis.
We
shall take
as our

CH. vi
AXIOMS
73
class of points the assemblage of all points in euclidean space
which
lie
within, but not upon, a sphere
of
radius
unity.
We
shall mean by the distance of two points one half the
real logarithm of the numerically larger of the two cross ratios
which they make with
the
intersections
of their
line with
the
sphere.
The
reader
familiar with
projective
geometry
will see that the segment of two points in the non-euclidean
sense will be coextensive with their segment in the euclidean
sense, and the congruent group will be the group of collinea-
tions which carry this sphere into
itself.
Lastly, we see that
we must
be under the
hyperbolic hypothesis,
for a
line
is
infinitely long, yet there is an infinite number of lines through
a given point, coplanar with a given
line, which yet do not
meet
it.
The
elliptic case
is treated similarly.
We take as points
the assemblage
of
all
points within
a
euclidean sphere of
small radius, and as the distance of two points
. times, the
x5
'I/
natural logarithm of a cross ratio which they determine with
the intersection of their line with the imaginary surface
By
a
proper
choice
of
the
cross
ratio and logarithm,
this
expression may be made positive, as
before.
The congruent
group
will bo
so much
of
the
orthogonal group as
carries
at least one point within our sphere into another such point.
The
elliptic hypothesis
will
prevail,
for two coplanar
lines
perpendicular to a third will tend to approach one another.
We may obtain a simultaneous bird's-eye view of our three
systems in two dimensions as follows.
Let us take
for
out-
class
of points
the assemblage
of
all
points
of a euclidean
sphere which
are south
of the equatorial
circle.
We
shall
define the distance of two points in three successive different
ways
:
(a) The
distance
of two
points
shall
be
defined
as
the
distance which the lines connecting them with the north pole
cut on the equatorial plane.
A
line will be a
circle which
passes through the north pole.
If we interpret the equatorial
plane as the Gauss plane, we
see that the congruent group
will be
^=as + /3,
aa=l,
or
rather so much of this group as
will carry at least one
Eoint
of the
southern hemisphere
into another such
point.
b is evident from the conforinal nature of the transformation
from
sphere
to
equatorial
plane,
that
we
are
under
the
euclidean hypothesis.

74,
CONSISTENCY A SIGNIFICANCE
CH.
(6) The distance of two points shall be defined as one half
the logarithm of the
cross
ratio on the
circle through them
in
a
vertical
plane
which
they
determine
with
the two
intersections of this circle and the equator.
A line here will
be
the
arc
of such a
circle.
The congruent group will be
that
group
of
(euclidean)
collineations
which
carries
into
itself
the
southern
hemisphere.
A
line
will
be
infinitely

infinite number of others through

chosen
point
failing
to
meet
it

i. e. we
are
under
the hyperbolic hypothesis.
(c) The distance of two points shall be defined as the length
of the arc of their great
circle.
Non-euclidean lines will be
arcs
of great
circles.
Congruent
transformations
will
be
rotations
of the* sphere, and
it
is
easy
to see that the sum
of the angles
of a triangle
is greater than a straight angle
;
we are under the elliptic hypothesis.
We have now shown that our system of axioms is sufficient,
for we have been able to introduce coordinates for our points,
and analytic expressions for distances and angles.
The axioms
are also
compatible,
for we have found
actual
systems
of
objects obeying them.
Compared with these virtues, all other
qualities of a system of axioms are of small import.
It will,
however, throw considerable
light upon the
significance of
these
our
axioms,
if we
examine
in
part,
their
mutual
independence, by examining the nature of those
geometrical
systems where first one, and then another of our assumptions
is supposed not to hold.
Axiom XIX
is
popularly known
as
the axiom
of
free
mobility, or rather, it
is the residue of that axiom when we
are
confined
to a limited space.
It puts into precise shape
the statement that figures may be moved about freely without
suffering an alteration either in size or form.
We have defined
congruent transformations by means of the relation congruent
which
is
itself
defined
in
the
logical
sense,
but
not
de-
scriptively.
We
might,
of
course,
have
proceeded
in
the
reverse
order.*
The ordinary conception in the elementary
textbooks seems to be that two figures are congruent if they
may
be superposed
;
superposed
means
that
they may
be
carried from place to place without losing size or shape, and
this in turn
implies that throughout the
transference, each
remains congruent to
itself, f
With regard to the independence of this axiom, we have but

to look at any system where the measure of distance in one
piano is double that of all the rest of space.
A triangle having
two vertices in this plane, and one elsewhere, could not be
congruently transformed into a triangle of a different sort.
Axiom XVIII
is the axiom of continuity.
We have
laid
special
stress on
it in the course of our work, although the
subject
of elementary
geometry may
be
pushed
very
far
without
its
aid.*
We
are
not
here
concerned
with
the
question
of the wisdom
of such
attempts,
considered from
the didactic point of view.
Systems of geometry where this
axiom
does
not hold
will
occur
to every
reader;
e.g. the
Cartesian euclidean system where all points whose coordinates
are non-algebraic are omitted.
It
is interesting to note that
whereas the omission of XIX
runs directly counter to
our
sense
experience, no amount
of
observation could
tell
us
whether or no our geometry were continuous, f
Axiom XVII
is an existence
theorem, not holding where
the geometry of the plane
is alone considered.
It is a very
curious fact that the projective geometry of the plane
is not
entirely independent of that of space, for Desargues' theorem
that
copolar
triangles
are
also
coaxal
cannot
be
proved
without the aid
either of a third dimension, or of the con-
gruent group. J
Axiom XVI gives a criterion for circumstances under which
two
lines must
necessarily
intersect.
It
is
evident
that
without
some
such
criterion we should
have
difficulty
in
proceeding any
distance
at
all among the
descriptive
pro-
perties of a plane.
It
is
difficult to show the independence
of this axiom.
The only dense system of geometry known
to the writer where it is untrue is the following.
Let us denote by R the class of all rational numbers whose
denominators are of the form
where
a. and
b+ are integers
or one may be
zero.
Let us
take as points the assemblage of all points of the euclidean
plane
whose
Cartesian
coordinates
are
rational
numbers
of
the
class

will not

There
are,
also, plenty
of geometries
of a
finite number
of points where
this axiom does not hold.*
Axiom XV is, of course, an existence theorem, untrue in the
geometry of a single lino.
Axiom XIV gives
the
fundamental
property
of
straight
lines.
As an example of a geometry where it does not hold,
let us consider the assemblage of all points within a sphere
of radius
one, and
define as the distance of two points the
length of an arc of a circle of radius two which connects them.
The
segment
of two
points
is thus
a
cigar-shaped
region
connecting them.
We see that the extensions of such a seg-
ment and
the segment
itself do
not
comprise
the
segment
of two points within the
original, and the extensions of the
latter.
Axioms XII and XIII are also in abeyance, and
ifc
seems
possible
that
these
three
axioms
are
not
mutually
independent.
The present writer
is
unable
to
answer
this
question.
Axiom XI implies that space has no boundary, and will be
untrue of the geometry within and on a sphere.
The first ten axioms amount to saying that distances are
magnitudes among which subtraction is always possible, but
addition only under restriction.

CHAPTER VII
THE GEOMETRIC AND ANALYTIC EXTENSION
OF SPACE
WE are now in a position to take up the second of those
fundamental
questions which we
proposed
at
the
close
of
Chapter
V, namely,
to determine what
degree
of precision
may
be
given
to Axiom
XI.
This axiom
tells
us
that,
popularly speaking, any segment may be extended beyond
either end.
How far may
it be so extended?
Are we able
to
state
that
there
exists a system
of geometry,
consistent
with
our axioms, where any segment may be extended by
any chosen amount?
Or,
in more
precise
language,
if AB
and PQ be given, can we always find C so that
We are already able to answer this question in the euclidean
case, and answer
it affirmatively.
We have seen that there
is no inconsistency in that system of geometry, where points
are in one to one correspondence with all triads of (real and
finite) values of three coordinates #, y, 0, and where distances
are given by the positive values of expressions of the form
Here,
if, as we have
said, we restrict the values of x, y, z
merely
to
be
real
and
finite, we have a
space
under
the
euclidean
hypothesis, where any segment may be extended
beyond
either
extremity by any
desired amount.
Such
a
space
shall be called euclidean space.
The same result will hold in the hyperbolic case.
We shall
have a consistent geometrical system
if we assume that our
points are in one to one correspondence with values
XQ'.^-.X^IX^
&2 <0,
Wxf + xf + xf + x* <0.
Here,
also, there
will
exist on every
line
distances whose
measures will be as large as we please.
The space under the

78
THE GEOMETRIC AND ANALYTIC
OH.
hyperbolic hypothesis, where any segment may be extended
by any chosen amount shall be called hyperbolic space.
To
put the matter otherwise, we
shall have euclidean or hyper-
bolic geometry if we replace Axiom XII by
:
AXIOM Xir.
If the parabolic or hyperbolic hypothesis be
true, and
if AB and PQ be any two distances, then there
will exist a single point
(7, such that
When we
turn
to
the
elliptic
case, we
find
a
decidedly
different state of affairs.
Suppose, in fact, that there
is a one
to one correspondence between the assemblage of all points,
and all sets of real values XQ
: xl
: &2
: x.r
The distance of two
points will depend upon the periodic function
cos
_
.
V(xx) V(yy)
If, to avoid ambiguity, we assume that the minimum positive
value should be taken
for
this expression, we should
easily
find two not null distances, whose sum was a null distance,
which would be in disagreement with Axiom X.
The
desideratum
is
this.
To
find a system
of geometry
where each point belongs to a sub-class subject to Axioms I-XIX,
and the elliptic hypothesis, and where each segment may still
be extended by any chosen amount, beyond either end.
AXIOM I.
There
exists a
class
of objects,
containing
at
least two members,
called points.
AXIOM
II'.
Every point
belongs
to a
sub-class obeying
Axioms I-XIX.
Definition. Any such sub-class shall be called a consistent
region.
AXIOM
III'. Any two
consistent
regions
which
have
a
common point, have a common consistent region including
this point and all others determining therewith a sufficiently
small, not null, distance.
AXIOM IV.
If P
and Pn+l be any two points there may
be found a finite number n of points Plf P2 , P3
.
. .Pn possessing
the property that each set of three successive ones belong to
a consistent region, and P^ is within the segment (Pjc ~i JPfc+i)
Definition. The assemblage of all points of such segments,
and all possible successive extensions thereof shall be called
a
line.

vii
EXTENSION OF SPACE
79
An important implication of the last axiom is that any two
points may
be connected
(conceivably
in many
ways)
by
a
chain
of
consistent
regions, where
each
successive
pair
have a
consistent sub-region in common.
This shows that
if we
set up a coordinate system like that of Chapter V in
any consistent region, we may, by a process of analytic ex-
tension, reach a set of coordinates
for every point in space.
We may also compare any two distances.
We have merely
to take
as unit of measure for one, a distance so small, that
a distance congruent therewith shall exist in the
first three
overlapping
consistent
regions
;
a
distance
congruent
with
this in the second three and so on to the last region, and then
compare the measures of the two
distances in terms
of the
first unit of measure, and the unit obtained from this by the
series of congruent transformations.
Let the reader show that
>
if once we find AB == PQ the same relation will hold
if wo
<
proceed by any other string of overlapping regions.
Having
thus
defined
the congruence
of any two
distances, we may
state our axiom for the extension of a segment, as follows
:
AXIOM V.
If AB and PQ be any two
distances,
there
exists
a
single
point G such
that EC = PQ, while B
is
within
a
segment whose
extremities
are C and a
point
of(AB).
An
important
corollary from
this
axiom
is
that
there
must exist in the elliptic case a point having any chosen set
of homogeneous coordinates
(x) not all zero.
For, let
(y) be
the
coordinates
of any
known
point.
Consider
the
line
through
it
whose
points
have
coordinates
of
the
form
\(y)+(ji(x).
As we proceed along this
line, the
ratio - will
always change in the same
sense, for such will be the case
in any particular
consistent
region.
Moreover we may, by
our last axiom, find a number of successive points such that
the sum
of
the
measures
of
their
distances
shall
be
kir.
Between the
first and last of these points the value of - will
M
have run continuously through
all values from
-co
to
oo
,
and hence have passed through the value
0, giving a point
with the required coordinates.
The preceding paragraph suggests two interesting questions.
Is
it
possible that, by varying
the method
of analytic ex-
tension, we might give
to any
point two
different
sets
of

80
THE GEOMETRIC AND ANALYTIC
en.
homogeneous coordinates in the same system ?
Is it possible
that two different points should have the same homogeneous
coordinates'?
With regard
to the
first of these questions,
it
is a fact that under our hypotheses a point may have several
different sets of coordinates, as we
shall
see at more length
in Chapter XVII.
For the present it is, however, wiser to limit
ourselves to the classical non-euclidean systems, where a point
has
a
unique
set
of
coordinates.
We
reach
the
desired
limitation by means of the following considerations.
A sufficiently small congruent transformation of any con-
sistent region
will
effect a congruent transformation of any
chosen sub-region, and so of any consistent region including
this
latter.
It thus
appears
that
if two
consistent regions
have
a common
sub-region, a
sufficiently
small
congruent
transformation of the one may be enlarged to be a congruent
transformation of the other.
Proceeding thus, if we take any
two consistent regions of space, and connect them by a series
of overlapping
consistent
regions, then
a
small
congruent
transformation
of the one may be
analytically extended
to
operate a congruent transformation in the other.
Will the
original transformation give
rise
to the same transformation
in the second space,
if the connexion be made by means of
a
different succession of overlapping consistent regions ?
It
is impossible to answer this question a priori
; we therefore
make the following
explicit assumption
:
AXIOM VI'. A congruent transformation of any consistent
region may be enlarged in a single way to be a congruent
transformation of every point.
Evidently, as a result of this, a congruent transformation
of one
consistent region can be
enlarged
in only
one way
to be a congruent transformation of any other.
Let us next
observe
that
it
is
impossible
that two
points
of the same
consistent region
should have
the same
coordinates
in any
system.
Suppose, on the contrary, that P and Q of a con-
sistent region have
the
coordinates
(x).
There
will be
no
limitation involved in assuming that the coordinate axes were
set up in this consistent region, and the coordinates of P found
directly as inChapter V, while those of Q are found by an analytic
extension through a chain of overlapping consistent regions.
Now
it
is not
possible
that
every
infinitesimal
congruent
transformation which
keeps P invariant
shall
also keep Q
invariant, so that a transformation of this sort may be found
transforming each overlapping consistent region infinitesiinally,
and carrying Q to an
infinitesiinally near point
Q'.
But in

vii
EXTENSION OF SPACE
81
the analytic expression
of
this
transformation,
in the form
of an orthogonal
substitution
(in
the
non-euclidean
cases)
the
values
(x)
will be
invariant,
so that Q"
will
also have
the coordinates
(x), and by the same chain of extensions as
gave these coordinates to Q.
Hence, reversing the order
of
extensions, when we
set up a coordinate system in the
last
consistent region, that which includes Q and
(/,
these two
points will have the same coordinates.
But this is impossible
for the coordinate system explained in Chapter V, for a con-
sistent
region
gives
distinct
coordinates
to
distinct
points.
This proof is independent
of Axiom
VI'.
Our
desired
uniqueness
of coordinate
sets
will
follow
at
once from the foregoing.
For, suppose that a point P have
two
sets
of coordinate values
(x) and
(a/), not
proportional
to
one another.
Every
infinitesimal
transformation
which
keeps the values (x) invariant, will either keep
(x') invariant,
or
transform
them
infinitesimally,
let
us
say,
to
a
set
of
values (#").
But there is a point distinct from P and close to
it which has the coordinates
(x"), and this gives two points
of a consistent region with these coordinates, which we have
just seen to be impossible.
Hence, the ratios of the coordinates
(XQ) must
be
unaltered
by
every
infinitesimal
orthogonal
substitution which
leaves
(x)
invariant,
i.e.
ir '= px$.
It
is
evident, conversely, that
if each
point have but one
set
of
coordinates, Axiom VI' must surely
hold.
It
is time
to
attack
the
other
question
proposed
above,
by
supposing
that two
distinct points
shall have the same
homogeneous
coordinates.
They may
not
lie
in
the
same
consistent region, and every congruent transformation which
leaves
one
invariant,
will
leave
the
other unmoved
also.
Let us call two such points equivalent.
Every line through
one
of
these
points
will pass through
the
other.
For
let
a point Q on a
line through one of the points have
coor-
dinates
(y).
We may connect
it with
the
other by a
line,
and
the two
lines
through
(Q)
lie
in
part
in
a
consistent
region,
the coordinates
of points on each being represented
in the form \yi + fjLXi
.
The two lines are identical.
Let
us consider the assemblage of all points whose
coor-
dinates are linearly dependent on those of three non-collinear
points.
This assemblage
of points may properly be
called
a plane, for those points thereof which
lie in any consistent
region will
lie
in a plane as
defined in Chapter
II.
It
is
clearly a connex
assemblage,
and
will
contain
every
line
whereof it contains two non-equivalent points.
Let (?/), (s), (t)
be
the
coordinates
of
three
points, no two
of which
are

82
THE GEOMETRIC AND ANALYTIC
CH.
equivalent.
Let us consider the point
(x) whose coordinates
are
(ux) = \uyzt\.
In the
elliptic
case,
as we have
seen, such a
point
surely
exists.
In the hyperbolic or parabolic cases, there might not
be any such point.
It
is clear, however, that in these cases,
there can be no equivalent points.
Suppose, in fact, P
and
Pn+l were equivalent.
Connect them by a line whereon are
Pj, P2 ...PW
.
Move this line slightly so that the connecting
string of points are P/, P/
.
. . Pw', very near to the former
points.
We
have
constructed
two
triangles,
and
(n
1)
quadrilaterals, and as we are under the hyperbolic or euclidean
hypothesis, the sum
of the measures of the angles of all the
triangles and
quadrilaterals
will be
less
than,
or
equal
to
TT -t- (71
1 ) 2 TT -f- TT.
But
clearly the sum
of the measures of
the angles at points P^ and P/ is 2nir, so that the sum of the
two angles which the two lines make at P and Pw+1
is null
or negative
; an absurd
result.
Equivalent points can then
occur only under the elliptic hypothesis, and there will surely
be a point P with the coordinates (x) above.
Let us next make a congruent transformation whereby P
goes into an equivalent point P ', the plane of (y)
(z)
(t) goes
into itself congruently, for it constitutes the assemblage of all
points
satisfying
the condition
(xX)
0, and (xX)
is
an
invariant under every orthogonal substitution.
After P has
been carried to P', each point of the plane may be returned
to
its
original
position by means
of a
series
of congruent
transformations, each too small to change P' to an equivalent
point, yet keeping the values
(x)
invariant, coupled,
at the
end, with a reflection in a plane perpendicular to the given
one,
in
case
the
determinant
of
the
original
orthogonal
substitution is negative, and this too will leave P' unchanged.
We may therefore pass from P to any equivalent point by
a transformation which leaves in place every point of a plane.
But
there
is
only
one
congruent
transformation
of
space
which
leaves
every point
of a
plane
invariant,
besides,
of
course, the
identical
one.
Hence every point in
space can
have but one equivalent at most.
Our results are, then, as follows.
Under the euclidean and
hyperbolic
hypotheses, there
is but one point
for each
set
of
coordinates, and
our new Axioms
I-VI'
will
yield
us
nothing more than euclidean or hyperbolic space.
Under the
elliptic hypothesis there are two possibilities
:
Elliptic space.
This
is a space obeying Axioms I-VI', and
the
elliptic
hypothesis.
If n
successive
segments
whose

measures are -

n

last
extremity
of the

segment

with
the
first extremity of the first.
Two lines of the same plane
will have one and only one common point, so that no point
has an equivalent.
We may take as a consistent region the
assemblage of all points whose distances from a given point
are
of measure
less than
-
.
If two
points be of such a
4
nature that the expression
for the cosine of the measure of
the
fcth part of their distance vanishes, we shall say that the
measure
of their
distance
is ~.
Two
points
will always
have a determinate distance and a single segment, unless the
measure of their distance is
, in which case they determine
&
two segments with
the same
extremities.
These
last
two
segments may also, with propriety, be called half-lines.
The
definition of an
interior angle given
in Chapter II may be
retained, but the concept of half-plane
is
illusory, for a line
will not
divide
the
plane.
It may, however, be
modified
much as we have modified the
definition of a
half-line, and
from
it a definition built up for a dihedral angle.
We leave
the details to the
reader.

equivalent points will have a well-defined segment.
We may
find a
definition
for a
half-line analogous
to
that given in
the
elliptic
case, and
so
for
half-plane, internal angle, and
dihedral angle.
An example of spherical geometry will be furnished by the
geometry
of
a hypersphere
in
four
dimensional
eucHdean
space, meaning by the distance
of two
points,
the
length
of the shorter arc of a great
circle connecting them.
A simple example of a two dimensional
elliptic geometry
is offered by the euclidean hemisphere, where opposite points
of the limiting great circle are considered as identical.
A two
dimensional
spherical
geometry
is
clearly
offered
by
the
euclidean sphere.
The elliptic and
spherical spaces which we have thus built
up
are,
in one
respect, more
complete
than
euclidean
or
hyperbolic space, in that there is in the first two cases always
a point to correspond with every
set of real values, not
all
zero,
that may be attached to our four homogeneous coor-
dinates #, while in the latter cases
this
is not so.
We bring
our
euclidean and hyperbolic geometries up to an
equality
with the others by extending our concept paint.
Let us begin
with the euclidean case where there
is a point corresponding
to every
real
set of homogeneous
values
a?
: xl
: #2
: #3
,
pro-
vided that x
() 9^ 0.
Now a
set
of values
: yl
: y2
: ?/3
will
determine
at
each
real
point
(x)
a
line, the
coordinates
of
whose points are of the form Xy^ + ^x^ and
if
(x) be varied
off of this
line, we get a second line coplanar with the
first.
Our
coordinates
: y^
: y%
: ?/3
will
thus
serve
to
determine
a
bundle
of
lines, and
this
will
have
exactly
the
same
descriptive properties as
a bundle of concurrent
lines.
We
may therefore
call the bundle an ideal point, and assign to
it
the
coordinates
(y).
Two
ideal
points
will
determine a
pencil
of planes
having the same
descriptive
properties
as
a pencil of planes through a common line.
We shall there-
fore say that they determine, or have in common, an ideal
line.
Two
lines
whose
intersection
is
ideal
shall be
said
to be parallel, as
also, two planes which meet
in an ideal
line.
These
definitions
of
parallel
are
for
euclidean
space
only.
The assemblage of all ideal points will be characterized
by the equation
t
___ n
&
u.
This we
shall
call the equation of the ideal plane which
is
supposed
to
consist
of the assemblage
of
all
ideal
points.
Ideal points and lines shall also be called infinitely distant,
while the ideal plane is called the plane at infinity.
We shall

EXTENSION OF SPACE
85
in future use the words point, line, and plane to cover both
ideal elements and those previously denned, which latter may
be
called, in
distinction, actual.
Actual and ideal elements
stand
on
exactly
the
same
footing
with
regard
to purely
descriptive
properties.
No
congruent
transformation
can
interchange actual and ideal elements.
We shall later return
to the meaning of such words as distance where ideal elements
enter.
In the hyperbolic case we may apply the same principles
with
slight modification.
There will be a real point corre-
sponding to each set of real homogeneous coordinates (x) for
Which
J2^2 + ^2 +^ + ^2 < 0>
A
set
of real homogeneous values
for
(#),
for which
this
inequality does not
hold,
will determine a bundle of
lines,
one
through
every
actual
point,
any
two
of
which
are
coplanar;
a bundle with the same descriptive properties as
a bundle
of concurrent
lines.
We
shall
therefore say that
this bundle determines an ideal point having the coordinates
(4
If
k2 x* +^ + x? + x* = 0,
the ideal point shall be said to be infinitely distant.
If
the ideal point shall be said to be ultra-infinite.
Two lines
having an infinitely distant point in common shall be called
parallel.
Through
each
actual
point
will
pass two
lines
parallel to a given line.
An equation of the type
(ux)
0,
7^ u
2 + u? + u^ + ?V > 0,
will give a plane.
If the inequality be not fulfilled, the assem-
blage of all ideal points whose coordinates
fulfil the equation
(and there can be no actual points which meet the requirement)
shall
be
called an ideal plane, the
coefficients
(in) being
its
coordinates.
There
will
thus be
a plane
corresponding
to
each
set
of real homogeneous
coordinates
(u)
not
all
zero.
An ideal
line
shall be defined as
in the euclidean case, and
the
distinction between actual and
ideal
shall be the same
as
there given.
No congruent transformation, as defined so
far, can interchange actual and ideal elements.
Let us take account of stock.
By the introduction of ideal
elements we "have made
each
of our spaces a
real
analytic
continuum.
In
all but the spherical case there
is a one
to
one
correspondence
between
points and
sets
of real homo-
geneous values not all zero, in spherical space there
is a one

to one correspondence of coordinate set and pair of equivalent
points.
Each
of
our
spaces
will
fulfil
the
fundamental
postulates of project!ve geometry, as we
shall develop them
in Chapter XVIII,
or as they have already been developed
elsewhere.*
Let
us show
hurriedly, how
to
find figures
to
correspond
to imaginary coordinate
values.
Four
distinct
points
will determine
six numbers called their cross
ratios,
which have a
geometrical
significance quite
apart from
all
concepts of distance
or measurement.f
An
involution will
arise when the points of a line are paired in such a reciprocal
manner that the
cross
ratios of any four
are equal
to the
corresponding cross
ratios
of their four mates.
If there be
no
self-corresponding
points,
the
involution
is
said
to
be
elliptic.
If
the
points
of
a
line
be
located by means
of
homogeneous
coordinates
A
:
ju,
it may be shown that every
involution may be expressed in the form
AM + B (A// + XV) + Vw'= 0.
In particular if
(?/) arid
(2) be the coordinates of two points,
there will exist an involution on their line determined by the
equations
(a .) = X (j,) + M (*),
()'= M (y)-A(*),
and by a proper choice of running coordinates any
elliptic
involution may be put
into
this
form.
Did we
seek
the
coordinates
of self-corresponding
points
in
this
involution,
we should get
(x) = (y)i(z).
Conversely, every set of homogeneous complex values (y) + i(z)
will
lead us
in
this way
to
a
definite
elliptic
involution.
The involution may be
taken
to
represent the two
sets of
conjugate imaginary homogeneous values.
We may separate
the conjugate values by the following device.
It is not difficult
to show
that
if a
directed distance
be
determined by two
points,
it
will
have
the
same
sense
as
the
corresponding
directed
distance
determined by
their
mates
in an
elliptic
involution.
To an
elliptic involution may thus be assigned
either one
of two senses of description, and we shall
define
as an imaginary point an
elliptic involution to which such
a sense has been attached.
Had we taken the other
sense,
we should have
said that we had the conjugate imaginary

An imaginary plane may similarly be defined as an
elliptic
involution among
the
planes
of
a
pencil,
with
a
particular
sense
of
description;
an imaginary
line
as
the
intersection
of two
imaginary
planes.
It may
be
shown
geometrically that by introducing imaginary elements under
these definitions we have a system of points, lines, and planes,
obeying the same descriptive laws of combination as do the
real
points
of
lines and
planes
of
protective
geometry,
or
the assemblage of all real homogeneous coordinate sets, which
do not vanish simultaneously.*
Introducing these imaginary
expressions, and the corresponding complex values
for their
homogeneous coordinates, we extend our space to be a perfect
analytic continuum.
We must now
see what
extension must be given to the
concept
distance,
in order
to
fit
the
extended
space
with
which we
are, henceforth, to
deal.
To begin with, we shall
from
this time forth identify the two concepts distance and
measure of distance.
In other words, as the concept distance
comes into our work effectively only in terms of its measure,
i. e. as a number, so we shall save circumlocution by replacing
the words measure of distance by distance throughout.
The
distance of two points is thus dependent upon the two points,
and on the
unit.
In any
particular investigation, however,
we assume that the unit
is well known from the
start, and
disregard
its existence.
We therefore give as the
definition
of the distance of two points under the euclidean hypothesis
d =
>
This
is,
at
worst,
a two
valued
function.
When
it
takes
a real value, we give the positive root as the distance, when
it
is imaginary we may make any
one
of
several
simple
conventions as to which root to take.
If one or both of the
points considered be ideal, the expression for distance becomes
infinite, unless also the radical vanishes when no distance
is
determined.
Under
these circumstances we
shall
leave the
concept
of distance
undefined,
thus getting
pairs
of points
disobeying Axiom II'.
Notice also that whenever the radical
vanishes
for
non-ideal
points we
have
points
which
are
distinct,
yet
have
a
null
distance, and when
such
points
are included, Axiom XIII may
fail.
We
shall
in like manner identify the concepts angle and

We may proceed in a similar manner in the non-euclidean
cases.

define as
their distance

This
equation
in d
has,
of course, an
infinite number of
solutions.
Before taking up the question of which shall be
called
the
distance
of the two
points,
let
us approach the
matter
in a
different, and highly interesting fashion due to
Cayley.*
This theory
is
of absolutely fundamental impor-
tance in
all that
follows.
The assemblage
of points
whose
coordinates
satisfy
the
equation
/
\ __ A
/Q\
(CC>^)
vJ.
V
/
shall be called the Absolute.
This
is a quadric
surface, real
in the hyperbolic
case, surrounding, so to speak, the actual
domain
; imaginary in the elliptic and spherical cases
;
in the
last-named, it is the locus of points which coincide with their
equivalents.
Every congruent transformation is an orthogonal
substitution, i.e. a linear transformation carrying the Absolute
into itself.
Let us, by definition, enlarge our congruent group
so that every such transformation shall be called congruent;
certainly it carries a point into a point, and leaves distances
unaltered.
In
the
euclidean
case we
take
as
Absolute the
conic
a; = 0,
x* + x* + x.*=Q,
(4)
and define as congruent transformations a certain six-parameter
sub-group
of
the
seven-parameter
collineation group which
carries
it
into
itself.
We
shall
return
to the study of the
congruent group in the next chapter.
Returning
to
the
non-euclidean
cases,
let
us
take
two
points Pj, P2 with coordinates
(x) and
(y), and let the
line
connecting them meet the Absolute in two points Q19 Q2
.
We
obtain
the
coordinates
of these by putting \(x) + ^(y)
into
the equation of the Absolute.
The ratio of the roots of this
equation
will give
one
of the two cross
ratios formed by
the pair
of points PXP2 and the
pair Q^o',
interchanging

89
the
roots we get the
other
cross
ratio of the two pairs
of
points *.
The value of such a cross ratio will thus be
(xy) +
*~(xx) (yy)
By interchanging the
signs
of the
radicals we change this
cross
ratio
into
its
reciprocal, and
this
amounts
to
inter-
changing the members of one of the two point pairs.
Let us

If we write the cross ratios of the pair of points P
3 P2 and
the
pair QT Q^
as (PjP2 > QiQ^> we may
re-define our non-
euclidean distance by the following theorem
:
Theorem.
If d be the
distance of two
points I\
and
P.,
whose line meets the Absolute in Q 1 and Q2 ,
The great beauty of this
definition
is that
it brings into
clear relief the connexion between distance and the congruent
group, for the cross ratio in question
is, of course, invariant
under
all
linear
transformation
which
carry
the Absolute
into itself,
i.e. under ail congruent transformations.
Let the
reader show that a corresponding protective
definition may
be given
for an
angle.
Our
distances,
as
so
far
defined,
are
infinitely
multiple
valued
functions.
There
is
no
great
practical
utility
in
rendering them
single valued by definition.
It
is, however,
perhaps worth while to carry
it through in one
case.
If we
have
two
real
points
of
the
actual
domain,
the
expression
(1\P*,
QiQ2 )
will have two
values,
real
in the
hyperbolic, pure imaginary in the elliptic and spherical case,
and these two are reciprocals, so that the resulting expressions
for d will
differ only in sign, for each determination of the
logarithm.
We may therefore take the distance as positive.
* For the geometrical interpretation of a
cross ratio when some of the
elements are imaginary, see Vori Staudt, loc. cit.,
28, and Luroth, loc. cit.

THE GEOMETRIC AND ANALYTIC
OH.
Did we seek, not for a distance, but a directed distance, then
it would
be
necessary
to
distinguish
once
for
all between
Ql and Q% and in each particular case between the pair PXP2 ,
and the pair P2Pi 5 ^ e directed distance will have a definite
value sometimes positive, sometimes negative.
Let us specialize by confining ourselves to the hyperbolic
case.
We
have
defined
the distance
of two
actual
points.
Still restricting
ourselves
to the
real
domain, suppose
that
we have an actual and an ultra-infinite point.
Let us choose
such a unit of measure that
A:2 =
1.
Our cross ratio is here
negative, with an absolute value r let us say, so that the distance
expression takes the form ^[log?*
(2m + !)TT
].
Let us choose
in particular
Next
consider two
ultra-infinite
points.
If the
line con-
necting them meet the Absolute in real points, we shall have
a real cross ratio as before, and hence a real positive distance.
If, however,
this
real
line meet the Absolute
in
conjugate
imaginary points, the expression for the cross ratio becomes
imaginary, and the simplest expression for their distance
is
pure imaginary.
The absolute value of this expression will
run between
and
,
for the
roots of ^logA = X
differ
by
7i i.
We may, hence, represent
all of these cross ratios in
the Gauss
plane by points
of the
axis
of pure imaginaries
between
and
9
If the line connecting two
ultra-infinite points be tangent
to the Absolute, the cross ratio
is unity, and we may take
the
distance
as
zero.
The
distance
from
a
point
of
the
Absolute
to
a
point
not
on
its
tangent
will
be
infinite
;
the
distance
to a point on
the tangent
is
absolutely inde-
terminate,
for
the
cross
ratio
is
indeterminate.
We may,
in
fact, consider
the
cross
ratios of three
coincident points
and a fourth,
as the limiting case of any cross ratio which
we
please.
Leaving aside the indeterminate case, we are thus able to
represent the distance of any two
real points of hyperbolic
space
in the Gauss plane by a point on
the
positive
half
of the axis of reals, by a point of the segment of the origin
and
- i y or by a point of the horizontal half-line

;

EXTENSION OF SPACE
91
and as two points move continuously in the real domain of the
hyperbolic
plane, the points which
represent
their
distance
will move continuously on the
lines described.
Let us now take two points of the hyperbolic plane, real or
imaginary.
We
see that the roots of ^ log A = X
differ by
multiples of iri,
so that we may assign to
(/ an imaginary
part whose Absolute
value
-
Moreover, by
choosing
properly between the two reciprocal values of the cross ratio,
we may ensure that the real part of d
shall not be negative.
If two points be conjugate imaginaries, while their line cuts
the Absolute in real points, the cross ratio
is imaginary, and
the expression for distance
is pure imaginary, which we may
represent by
a
point
of
the
segment
of
the
origin
and
i.
If both pairs of points be conjugate imaginaries, the
2>
^
cross ratio
is
real and
negative,
so
that
the
distance may
be represented in the form X
-i.
We shall define as the
distance of two points that value of the logarithm
of a cross
ratio which they form with
the intersection of their line and
the
Absolute, which
in the Gauss
plane
is
represented by
a point of the infinite triangle whose vertices are cc
,
+
~
I >
-
i.
The
possible ambiguities for points on the sides of
this triangle have already been removed by
definition.
We have already seen that when euclidean space has been
enlarged to be a perfect analytic continuum, imaginary points
and distances come in which do not obey all of our axioms.
In the hyperbolic case we shall find real, though ultra-infinite,
points which
do
not
at
all obey
the
principles
laid down
for a
consistent
region.*
Let us take
three
points of the
ultra-infinite
region
of the actual hyperbolic
plane
x% = 0,
say
(x), (2;), (%)
As these points are supposed to
be real we
may assume that xl9 x% are real, while x
is a pure imaginary,
and that a like
state
of affairs
exists
for
(y) and
(z).
We
shall
further
assume
that
the
lines
connecting them
shall
intersect the Absolute in real, distinct points.
We have then

To see what region of the ultra-infinite domain
is determined
by (9), let us sketch the Absolute as a conic, and draw tangents
thereunto from
(y) and
(z). X must
lie within the quadri-
lateral
of these tangents or the
vertical angle at
(y)
or
(z).
The conic and tangents determine four quasi-triangles
with
two rectilinear and one curvilinear side each.
Since (yy) >
our inequality (9) will hold within the quasi-triangles whose
vertices
are
(y)

the

of
these

CHAPTER VIII
THE GROUPS OF CONGRUENT TRANSFORMATIONS
THE most
significant idea
introduced
in
the
last chapter
was that of the Absolute, and
its connexion with the concept
of distance.
Every collineation of non-euclidean space which
keeps
the
Absolute
in
place was
defined
as
a congruent
transformation
; we had already seen in Chapter V that every
congruent transformation was such a
collineation.
We may
go one step further, and say that every analytic transforma-
tion which carries the Absolute into itself alone is a congruent
transformation.
Suppose that we have
V= /o (Xoxi x2) <,
xi = fi (Vi^A)> <= /a (^1^3),
#3 r= JT3 (Xg ij X%$3 J ,
(xfx') = P (xx).
P must
be a
constant,
for were
it
a
function
of
(x)
the
Absolute would be
carried
into
itself, and into some other
surface P = 0, which
is contrary to
hypothesis.
Replacing
(x) by A (.?;) 4- & (y) we see that we shall also have
(x'y') = P(xy),
whence we may
easily show that
the
transformation
is
a
collineation.
It
is, of course, evident, that in the complex domain,
the
congruent groups of elliptic and hyperbolic space are identical,
as
they
are merely
the
quaternary
orthogonal
group.
In
the real domain, however, the
structure
of the two
is quite
different, and our present task
shall be the actual formation
of those groups, pointing out besides certain interesting sub-
groups.
We shall incidentally treat the euclidean group as
a limiting case where j^ = 0.

As the Absolute must be projectively transformed into

we may put

+ 2(au a 22 + a 21 a 12)i2
.
If we view the matter geometrically, we see that there are
three distinct possibilities.
First the two fixed points of the
Absolute conic are conjugate imaginaries.
The real line con-
necting them
is
ultra-infinite, and has an
actual
pole with
regard to the Absolute.
This will give a rotation about this
point, and we shall have
(a il + a 22)
2 - 4A =
(ail- a 22)
2 + 4c( l2 a 21 <
0*
If the fixed points of the Absolute conic be
real,
the trans-
formation, in the actual domain, will appear as a sliding along
a real line, if A > 0, or a sliding combined with a reflection
in a perpendicular plane through
this line
if A < 0.
In the
third
case
the two
fixed
points
of the Absolute
conic
fall
together, and the
third
fixed point of the plane
falls
there
too.
The transformation carries a pencil of parallel lines into
itself.

the theory of functions.
Suppose, in
fact, that we have the
euclidean sphere

The geometry thereof will be exactly our spherical geometry,
and we wish
for the group of congruent transformations
of
this
sphere
into
itself.

us

the

graphically from the north

take

the others by a simple change of variables.

The distinction between motions and symmetry transforma-
tions stands out in clear
relief when we consider the
effect
upon the Absolute.
The sub-group of motions includes the
identical transformation, and any motion may be reached by
a continuous change in the six essential parameters from the
values which give the identical transformation, without ever
causing the modulus to vanish.
This shows that
as, under
the
identical transformation, each generator of the Absolute
stays in place, so, under the most general motion, the generators
of each
set are permuted among one another.
On the con-
trary, the most general symmetry transformation
will arise
from
the
combination
of
the most general motion with
a
reflection, and
it
is easy to
see that a
reflection will
inter-
change
the two
sets of generators.
In
the
elliptic
case we
shall have
the group
of
all
real
quaternary orthogonal
substitutions.
An extremely elegant
way
of
expressing
these
is
offered
by
the
calculus
of
quaternions.
Let us, following the Hamiltonian notation, assume three
new symbols
i, j, k
:
i2 =/ = /*= ijlc= -1.
We assume that they obey the associative and commutative
laws
of
addition,
the
associative and
distributive
laws
of
multiplication.
An expression of the type
is called a quaternion, whereof
is called the Tensor.
It
is easy to show that the tensor of
the product of two quaternions is the product of their tensors.
Let us next write
where P and Q are quaternions.
Multiplying out the right-
hand side, and identifying the real parts and the coefficients
of i,j, k, we have x^x^x^x^ expressed as linear homogeneous
functions
of x^x^x^
The
modulus
of the transformation
will be different from zero, and we shall have

the distinction between motions and symmetry transformations
being as in the hyperbolic case.
Our group of motions
is half-simple, being made up of two
invariant sub-groups G3 G3

severally by assuming
that Q
or P reduces

real
number.
We
obtain
their
geometrical
significance as follows
:
The

be
divided
into
two
in-
variant three-parameter sub-groups
r/3 <j.^ by resolving
it into
the two groups which keep invariant
all generators
of the
one or the other set on the Absolute.
Now were
it possible
to

in
two
different ways,
the

?t would be an
invariant
sub-group,
not only
of G 6
but of
(f/3
.
This may not be, for
f/a is nothing but the binary
projective group which has no invariant sub-groups.
Hence
the groups
//3 <// are identical with G
:] G.J, arid the latter keep
the one or the other set of generators all in place.
It
is
well worth our while
to look more deeply into the
properties
of these sub-groups.
Let
us
distinguish the two
sots
of generators
of the
Absolute by
calling the one
left,
and
the
other
rlyld.
This may be
done
analytically
by
adjoining a number
I to our domain of rationals.
Two lines
which cut
the same
left
(right)
generators of the Absolute
shall
be
called
Left
(right) paratactic.*
As
the
conjugate
imaginary to each generator of the Absolute belongs to the
same
set
as
itself, we
see that through each
real point
will
pass a real left and real right paratactic to each real line
; and
the same will hold
for each real plane.
Of course there are
possible
complications
in
the imaginary
domain, but
these
need not concern us here.
Let us now look at a real congruent transformation which
keeps all right generators invariant.
Two conjugate imaginary
left generators will also be invariant, and every line meeting these

We
have already donned
parallels
as lines intersecting on the Absolute, and
although in the present case such lines cannot both be real, yet it is better to
be consistent in our terminology, especially since we shall find in Chapter XVI
a transformation carrying parallelism into parataxy.

two will be carried into itself, every other line will be carried
into a line right paratactic to
itself.
Such a transformation
shall be called a
left translation, since the path curves of all
points will
be a congruence of left paratactic
lines.
In fact
this congruence
will give the path curves
for a whole one-
parameter family of left
translations.
Let the reader show
that under a translation, any two points will
be transported
through congruent distances.
Before leaving the
elliptic
case,
let us notice that in the
elliptic plane a reflection in a line is identical with a reflection
in a point, or a rotation through an angle
ir, in a spherical
plane they are different, and a reflection in a line
is the same
as a rotation through an angle
TT coupled with an interchange
of each point with
its equivalent.
In three dimensions, there
is never any identity between a rotation and a reflection, on
the other hand nothing new
is brought in by interchanging
each point with
its equivalent,
for as each plane
is hereby
transformed
into
self, we may
split up
the
transformation
into a
reflection
in a
plane, a reflection in a second plane
perpendicular to the
first, and a rotation through an angle

CHAPTER IX
POINT, LINE, AND PLANE TREATED
ANALYTICALLY
THE object of the present chapter is to return, as promised
in Chapter VI, to the problems of elementary non-euclidean
geometry, from the higher point of view gained by extending
space
to be a perfect analytic continuum.
We shall find
in
the Absolute a Dens ex Mdchina to relieve us from many an
embarrassment.
We
shall
leave
aside
the
euclidean
case,
and, for the most part, handle all of our non-euclidean cases
together, leaving to
the
reader
the
simple task
of making
the
distinction between the
elliptic and the
spherical cases.
Otherwise
stated, our present task
is to express the funda-
mental metrical theorems of point,
line, and plane,
in terms
of the invariants of the congruent group.
Let us
notice,
at the
outset, that the principle
of duality
plays
a fundamental
role.
The
distance
of two
points
is
. x logarithm
of
the
cross
ratio
that they form with the
points where
their line meets the Absolute, the angle of two
planes
is
-
. x logarithm of the cross ratio which they form
&
'i/
with two
pianos
through
their
intersection, tangent to tho
Absolute
; the distance from a point to a plane is
minus its
distance to the pole of that plane with regard to the Absolute.
Two
intersecting
lines
or
planes which are conjugate with
regard
to
the
Absolute
are
mutually
perpendicular.
Two
points which are conjugate with regard to the Absolute shall
be
said
to be mutually orthogonal.
In the
real domain
of
hyperbolic space, if one of two such points be actual, the other
must be ideal
; the converse is not necessarily true.
Let us begin in the non-euclidean plane, say x3
0.
Let
us take two points A, B with coordinates
(x) and (y) respec-
tively, and
find
the two
points
of their
line which are
at

102

congruent
distances from
them.
These
shall be called
the
centres of gravity of the two points, and are, in fact, the two
points which divide harmonically the given
points, and the
intersections of their line with the Absolute.
We purposely
exclude the spherical
case, where the centres of gravity will
be equivalent points.
The
necessary and
sufficient
condition
that
the
point
A. (.r) + n (y) should
be
at
congruent
distances from

It

clear that such

threes, in four
points which may be called the centres of gravity of the three
given
points.
On the other hand the
centres of gravity of
our pairs of points are collinear in threes.
Lastly, notice that
a dual theorem might be reached by interchanging the objects,
point and line, distance and angle
; by taking, in fact, a polar
reciprocation in the Absolute:

It would be quite erroneous to suppose that either of these

The centres of gravity will form with the given
points a desmic configuration*
The meaning of this phrase
is
as follows.
Let us indicate the centres of gravity by the
signs
prefixed
to
their
radicals, giving always
to
the

divide
our

We see that a line connecting a point of one
lot, with any
point of a second, will pass through a point of the third.
The

lie by threes on sixteen
lines, four

each.
In like manner we shall find that if
we take the twelve planes obtained by omitting in turn one
point of each lot, two planes of different lots are always coaxal
with one of the third.
Let the reader who is unfamiliar with
the desmic configuration, study the particular case (in euclidean
space) of the vertices of a cube, its centre, and the ideal points
of concurrence of its parallel edges.

The square of the moment of the two lines is negative, so that

In

CHAPTER X
THE HIGHER LINE-GEOMETRY
IN Chapter IX we took some
first steps in non-euclidean
line-geometry.
The
object
of
the
present
chapter
is
to
continue
the
subject
in
the
special
direction
where
the
fundamental
element
is
not,
in
general, a
line, but a pair
of lines invariantly connected.*
Let us
start
in the
real domain of hyperbolic space and
consider a linear complex whose equation
is
<&!$ =
<>.

i, j, k = 1, 2, 3,
and the congruence, whose equations are

will be composed of all lines of our complex and its absolute
polar, or common to all complexes of the pencil
(ldol w

.
.
. (Zdjja -f m&01).
These complexes shall be said to form a coaxal pencil, and
the two mutually absolute polar lines, which are the directrices
of the congruence, shall be called axes of the pencil.
We get
their pllickerian
coordinates by giving to
I
: m such values
that the complex shall be special.
Let us now write

A complex coaxal with the given line will be obtained by
multiplying the numbers (X) by
(i + mi).
A pair of
real
lines which
are mutually absolute
polar,
neither of which
is tangent to the Absolute, shall be called
a
proper
cross.
They
will
determine
a
pencil
of
coaxal
complexes.
If either of the lines have the pllickerian coor-
dinates (a), then the three numbers (X) given by equations (1)
may be taken to represent the cross.
These coordinates (X)
are homogeneous in the complex (i.e. imaginary) domain, for
the
result
of multiplying
them through by
(l + mi)
is
to
replace the complex
(a) by a coaxal complex, and therefore
to leave the axes of the pencil unaltered.
Conversely, suppose that we have a triad of coordinates (X)
which are homogeneous in the imaginary domain.
The coor-
dinates of the
lines of the corresponding cross will be found
from (1) by assigning to
p such a value that the coordinates
(a)
shall
satisfy the fundamental
pluckerian
identity.
For
this
it
is necessary and sufficient that the imaginary part of
P
2 (XX) should vanish, i.e.
X,
X,
To
get
the
other
line of the
cross,
i.e. the Absolute polar
of the line
(d), we merely have to reverse the sign of one
of our radicals.
There
is one, and only one
case, where our equations
(2)
become illusory, namely where
(XX) = 0.
This will arise when
(aW^ZaJ-Zatf^Q,
i.e. when the directrices of the congruence are tangent to the
Absolute.
All complexes of the pencil will here be special,
and
will be determined severally by
lines intersecting the
various tangents to the Absolute at this point.
Any mutually
polar lines of the pencil of tangents, will, conversely, serve to
determine the coaxal system.
We may then represent such
a pencil of tangent lines by a set of homogeneous values (X )
where (XX) = 0,
and, conversely, every such
set
of homo-
geneous
values
will
determine a pencil
of tangents to the
Absolute.
We shall therefore define such a pencil of tangents
as an improper cross.

Theorem 1. There exists a perfect one to one correspondence
between the assemblage of all crosses in hyperbolic space, and
the assemblage of all points of the complex plane of elliptic
space.
Improper
crosses
will
correspond
to
points
of
the
elliptic Absolute.
We shall say that two crosses intersect
if their lines inter-
sect.
The N. S. condition for this in the case of two proper
crosses will be
(XY)
(XY)
*
Geometrically a line may
intersect either member of a cross.
This ambiguity disappears in the case of perpendicular inter-
section.
Theorem 2. Two
intersecting
crosses
will
correspond
to
points, the cosine of whose distance is real, or pure imaginary
;
crosses intersecting orthogonally will correspond to orthogonal
points of the elliptic plane.
The assemblage
of
crosses which
intersect a given
cross
orthogonally
will be given by means of a linear equation.
A linear equation will be transformed linearly into another
linear
equation,
if the variables and
coefficients be treated
contragrediently.
Geometrically we
shall imagine that our
assemblage of
crosses, cross space let us say, is doubly over-
laid, the crosses of one layer being represented by points and
those of the other by lines in the complex plane, we have then
Theorem 3. The necessary and sufficient condition that two
crosses of different layers should intersect orthogonally is that
the corresponding line and point of the complex plane should
be in united position.
If a cross be improper, the assemblage of all crosses cutting
it orthogonally will be made up of all lines through the point
of contact, and all lines in the plane of contact.
This assem-
blage, reducible in point space, is irreducible in cross space.
The collineation group of cross space, is the general group
depending on eight complex, or sixteen real parameters

When will this indicate a transformation of point space?
It is certainly necessary that improper crosses should go into
improper crosses, hence the substitution must be of the ortho-,

THE HIGHER LINE-GEOMETRY
119
gonal type.
Moreover, the Absolute of hyperbolic space
be transformed into itself, so that our transformation of point
space must be a congruent one.
Conversely, it is immediately
evident that a congruent transformation will transform cross
space linearly into itself.
Also, an orthogonal substitution in
cross
coordinates
will
carry an improper cross into an im-
proper
cross, and
will
carry intersecting crosses into other
intersecting
crosses.
The
corresponding
transformation
in
point space is not completely determined, for a polar recipro-
cation in the Absolute of point space appears as the identical
transformation
of
cross
space.
A
transformation
which
carries intersecting crosses into intersecting crosses may thus
be interpreted
either
as a
collineation,
or a
correlation
of
point space.
Theorem 4. Every collineation or correlation of hyperbolic
space which leaves the Absolute invariant will be equivalent
to an orthogonal substitution in cross space, and every such
orthogonal
substitution may be interpreted either as a con-
gruent
transformation
of
hyperbolic
space,
or a congruent
transformation
coupled
with
a
polar
reciprocation
in
the
Absolute;
Let us now inquire as to what are the simplest figures of
cross space.
The simplest one dimensional figure is the chain
composed of all crosses whose coordinates are linearly depen-
dent, by means
of
real
coefficients,
on those
of two given
crosses,
pX{ = aY^ bZt ,
i = 1, 2, 3.
(4)
Interpreting these equations in the complex plane we see
that we have oo 1 points of a line so related that the cross ratio
of any four is real.
If this line be repre&ented in the Gauss
plane, the chain will be represented by a
circle.
If the line
be imaginary, the
real
lines, one through each point of the
chain, will generate a linear pencil or a regulus.*
The crosses of the chain will cut orthogonally another cross
(of the other
layer)
called the axis of the chain.
The axis
being proper, the
chain will contain two improper
crosses,
namely,
the
pencils
of tangents to
the
Absolute where
it
meets the actual line of the chain.
There is a theorem of very great generality connected with
chains, which we
shall now give.
Suppose that we have a

The common perpendiculars to a

we have two real and two imaginary linear pencils

ditions
for this in cross coordinates will be invariant under
the orthogonal, but not under the general group.
The general

is a ruled quartic, having a strong simi-
larity to the euclidean cylindroid.
The simplest two dimensional system of crosses is the chain

It is generated by common perpendiculars to the pairs of lines
of a regulus.
Those lines of the congruence which meet a line

surface, those which meet such a
line obliquely generate a
regulus whose conjugate belongs to the reciprocal congruence.
The two congruences have the same focal surface of order and

related that each cross of one is a cross of striction of a cross
of
the
other, and
all
its
adjacent
crosses.
We may
reach
a still clearer idea of these congruences by anticipating some
of the
results of differential geometry to be proved in
later"
chapters.
For,
if we
look
upon
the
congruence
of
lines
generated by our
crosses, we
see that the two
focal points
on each
are orthogonal and the two
focal planes mutually
perpendicular.
From
this we
shall conclude
that our
line-
congruence
is one of normals, and the
characteristics of the
developable
surfaces of the congruence
will be geodesies of
the focal surface, to which the lines of the other congruence
are binormals.
We
shall, moreover, show in a later chapter
that if rx and r2 be the radii of curvature of normal sections of
a surface in planes of curvature, then the Gaussian expression
for the curvature of the surface at that point will be

Our congruence is made up of normals to surfaces of Gaussian

of a curve of the complex plane.
It will be made up of crosses
whose
lines are normals to a
series of surfaces of Gaussian
curvature zero.
The characteristics of the developable surfaces
are geodesies of the focal surfaces.
Their orthogonal trajec-
tories
are
a

set
of
geodesies
whose

let us emphasize
the
distinction between
these
congruences and

where
the

Did we wish to
represent the imaginary
as
well
as
the
real members of a synectic or non-synectic congruence, we
should be obliged to introduce into our representing plane,
points with hypercomplex
coordinates.

the subject
lies merely in this, namely, to give a real inter-
pretation for the geometry of the complex plane.
As we
identify
the geometry
of the
cross
in
hyperbolic
space with that of a point of the complex plane, so we may
relate a cross of elliptic
(or spherical) space to a pair of real
points of two plane.
The modus operandi is as follows
:
We start, as before, with a pencil of coaxal linear complexes
defined by
,

a01
a23 =
<r rA l ,
If we replace our complex by another coaxal therewith, we
shall merely multiply dX)
(rX) by two
different constants.
Conversely, when we wish to move back from the indepen-
dently
homogeneous
sets
of
coordinates
(}X)
(rX)
to
the
degenerate complexes of the
pencil,
i.e.
to the
lines
of the
cross defined thereby, we have to take for p and a such values
that the fundamental pliickerian identity is satisfied,
raoi =
v()+ 7
.
iv,
The two separately homogeneous coordinate triads faX) (rX)
may be taken to represent this proper cross, and, conversely,
as all quantities involved so far are supposed to be real, every
real pair of triads will correspond to a single cross.
Tfoorem 10. The assemblage of all real crosses of elliptic
or spherical space may be put into one to one correspondence
with the assemblage of all pairs of points one in each of two
real planes.
Our doubly homogeneous coordinates have a second inter-
pretation which is of the highest interest.
Let us write the
coordinates of a point of the Absolute in terms of two inde-
pendent parameters,
i.e. of the parameters determining
the
one and the other set of linear generators

The pliickerian coordinates of a generator of the left or right
system will thus be

We thus
get as a necessary and
sufficient condition that
two lines should be right (left) paratactic, that the differences
(sums) of complementary pairs of pllickerian coordinates in
the one shall be proportional to the corresponding differences
(sums) in the other.
If the lines be (p) and
(p'), the first of
these conditions will be
[(P
I P') + IPijPijT-S Pij* Spy* = 0,
while the second is
[(pM-SpijPijT-Spif Zpij'

If
these
equations be
multiplied
together, we
get

of
Chapter IX.
If a line pass through the point
(1,
0,
0, 0)
its last three
pliickerian coordinates
will vanish, while the
first three are
proportional to those of its intersections with x = 0.
It thus
appears that in (11) the coordinates dX) and
(rX) are nothing
more nor
less than the coordinates of the points, where the
plane # =
is met
respectively by the
left and the right
paratactic through the point
(1, 0, 0, 0) to the two lines of the
cross,
for a line
paratactic
to
the one
is also paratactic
to
the other.
It
will, however, be more convenient to consider
(lX) and
(rX) as standing for points in two different planes,
called,
respectively, the
left and rigfit
representing
planes.
We shall speak of two crosses as being paratactic, when their
lines are so, and the necessary and
sufficient condition there-
fore,
invariant under the group
of cross space,
is that they
should be represented by identical
points
in the one or the
other plane.*
As in the hyperbolic case, so here, we shall look upon cross
space as doubly overlaid, and assign a cross to the upper layer
if it be determined by two points in the representing planes,
while it shall be assigned to the lower layer if it be determined
by two lines.
Under these circumstances we may say
:

crosses of different

it

that they should be represented by line elements in the two
planes.
We may go
still further in this same direction.
We shall
mean by the right and left Clifford angles of two crosses, the
angles of right and loft paratactics to them through any chosen
point.
Let the reader show that the magnitude of these angles
is independent of the choice of the last-named point.
If, thus,
we
choose

of the

The ambiguity can be removed by establishing certain con-

We may, however, state the following
theorem
:
Theorem 12. The Clifford angles of two lines have the same-
measures as the sums and differences of the kth parts of their
distances, or the sums and differences of their angles.
The
necessary and sufficient condition that two lines should inter-
sect
is that their Clifford angles should be equal or supple-
mentary.

When we
adjoin the imaginary domain to
the

serious complications will
arise which can only bo removed
by
careful
definition.

complete
dis-
cussion, wo merely give the
facts.*
If dXfi) = 0,
(rXrX) ^ 0, we
shall
say
that we
have
a
left improper
cross, and denote
thereby a
left generator
of
the
Absolute,
conjoined
to
a
non-parabolic
involution
among the right generators.
There will be co 3 such improper
crosses, and
oo 3 right improper
crosses, whose
definition
is
obvious.
Left and right improper crosses together will con-
stitute what shall be called ivnproper crosses of the first sort.
Improper
crosses
of the second
sort shall be
defined, as
in
hyperbolic
space, as
pencils
of
tangents
to
the
Absolute,
corresponding to sets of values for which (jX }X) = (rX rX) = 0.
The definitions of parataxy and orthogonal intersection may
be extended
to
all
cases, their analytic expression being as
in the real domain.
The general group of linear transformations of cross space
will depend upon
sixteen
essential parameters.
It
will be
made up of the sixteen-parameter sub-group

formations of the type

and the sixteen-parameter assemblage J/16 of all transforma-
tions of the type
Notice that under G1Q
left and right parataxy of crosses of
the same layer are invariant, while under H1Q the two sorts
of parataxy are interchanged.
The group
Cr16 will contain, as a sub-group, the group of all
motions, while Hu includes the assemblage of all symmetry
transformations.
Let the reader show that there can be no
collineations of point space under G16 , except congruent trans-
formations, and that
the
necessary and
sufficient
condition
that
(14) should represent a motion
of point space
is that
the transformations
of
the two
representing
planes should
be of the orthogonal type.
The group

is half-simple, being composed entirely of
two
invariant sub-groups

The highest common
factors of the group of motions with

be

The simplest assemblages of crosses in
elliptic space bear
a
close analogy to those of hyperbolic
space, although
pos-
sessing more variety in the real domain.
Let
The assemblage of crosses so defined shall be called a chain.
The properties of these chains are entirely analogous to those
in the hyperbolic
case.
For instance, take a congruence of
crosses whose coordinates are analytic functions of two essential
parameters
(u),
(v).
Let
us further assume that

The meaning of this restriction
is that neither (jF) nor
(rF)
can be expressed as functions of a single parameter, so that
the crosses of the congruence cannot be assembled into the
generators of
oo 1 surfaces,
those of each surface being para-
tactic.
Let
the
reader
then
show
that
for
every
such
congruence,
the common
perpendiculars
to
a
line
in
the
general position, and its immediate neighbours, will generate
a chain.
The chains of elliptic cross space will have the same sub-
classifications under the congruent group, as in the hyperbolic
plane.
Let the reader show that the general chain may be
represented by means of a homographic relation between the
points of two
linear ranges in the representing planes, and
that the special chain, composed of two pencils, arises, when
the relation is a congruent one.
Suppose, next, that we have
This
is a new one-parameter family of crosses called a strip,
or, more exactly, a
left
strip.
The common
perpendiculars
to pairs of crosses of the left strip will generate a right strip
(whereof the definition is obvious), and each strip shall be said
to be reciprocal to the other.
A left strip of the upper layer

left plane, and a linear
range of the right plane.
The reciprocal
strip in the lower
layer will
be
represented by
the
pencil through the point
in the left plane, and the line of the range in the right.
In
point
space, the
lines
of a
strip
are generators
of a
quadric, whose other generators belong to the reciprocal strip.
Owing to the parataxy of the generators
of such a quadric,
it will intersect the Absolute in two generators of each
set.
We
shall
call our quadric a
Clifford surface, when we wish
to
refer to
it as a figure of point space.
We shall show in
Chapter XV, that these surfaces have Gaussian curvature zero,
since they are generated by paratactic lines, and are minimal
surfaces,
since

an

system.*
The simplest two dimensional system of crosses will be, as

The reciprocal congruence will be given by
lU{ =a irU{

There are various sub-classes under the congruent group.
If the squares of no two of our quantities a^ in (16) be equal,
we have the general congruence, if we have one such equality,
the
congruence
will
be
transformed
into
itself by
a
one-
parameter group of rotations.
If all three squares be equal,
we have a bundle of crosses through a point.
The general

THE CIRCLE AND THE SPHERE
THE simplest curvilinear figures in non-euclidean geometry
are circles, and it is now time to study their properties.*
Definition. The locus of all points of a plane at a constant
distance from a given point which
is not on the Absolute
is called a
circle.
The given point shall be called the centre
of the
circle,
its absolute polar, which will also turn out to
be its polar with regard to the circle, shall be called the axis
of the circle.
A line through the centre of the circle shall be
called a diameter.
Let the
reader show
that
all points of
a
circle are at constant distances from the
axis, a distance
whose measure becomes infinite in the limiting euclidean case.
To get the equation of the circle whose centre
is
(a) and
whose radius is r, i.e. this shall be the measure of the distance
of all points from the centre, we have

THE CIRCLE AND THE SPHERE
CH.
Restricting
ourselves, for the moment, to the
real domain
of the hyperbolic plane, we
see that
if the centre be
ideal,
the axis will be actual, and the curve will appear in the actual
domain as the locus of points at a constant distance from the
axis, an
actual
line.
In
this
case
the
circle
is sometimes
called an equidistant curve.
If the centre be actual we shall
have
what may be
more
properly
called
a
proper
circle.
Notice that to a dweller in a small region of the hyperbolic
space, a proper circle would appear much as does a euclidean
circle to a euclidean dweller, while an equidistant curve would
appear
like
two
parallel
lines.
These
distinctions
will,
naturally, disappear in the elliptic case
; in the spherical, the
circle will have two centres, which are equivalent points.
If the point (a) tend to approach the Absolute (analytically
speaking)
the
equation
(1)
will tend
to approach an inde-
terminate
form.
The
limiting form
for
the
curve
will
bo
a conic having four-point contact with the Absolute.
Such a
curve shall be called a horocycle^ the point of contact being
called the centre, and the common tangent the axis.
If (u) be
the coordinates of the axis, we have
(uu) = 0,
and the equation of the horocycle takes the form
(V + u2
2
) (xx) + C (uxf = 0.
Theorem

Theorem
2'. A point on a
a circle is perpendicular to the
circle
is
orthogonal
to
the
diameter through the point of
point where the tangent there-
contact,
at meets the axis.
These simple theorems may be proved in a variety of ways.
For instance every circle will be transformed into
itself by
a
reflection
in any diameter, hence
the tangent where the
diameter meets the curve must be perpendicular to the diameter.
Or, again, if AB == AC, a line from A to one centre of gravity
of B, G will be perpendicular to BG'; then let B and G close
up on this centre of gravity.
Or, lastly, the equation of the
tangent to the circle (1) at a point (y) will be
(xy) (aa)
N(ax) (ay) = 0.
The diameter through (y) will have the equation
| xya
| = 0.
If we indicate these two lines by (u) and (v), then
(uv) = (aa)
| yay
\ -N (ay) \aya\.
Let the reader show that these theorems hold also in the
case of the horocycle.

We shall subsequently define this expression as the curva-
ture of the circle at the point (P).
We see that, as we should
expect, it is constant.
We shall next take up simple systems of circles.
We leave
to the reader the task of making the slight modifications in
what follows necessary to adapt
it to the case of spherical
geometry.
In the general case two
circles, neither of which
is a line, will intersect in four points,
real, or imaginary, in
pairs.
If two circles lie completely without one another they
will have four real common tangents, the absolute polars of
such
circles will intersect in four real points.
The difficulty
of visualization disappears in the hyperbolic case where we
take one at least of the circles as an equidistant curve.
If we
identify the euclidean hemisphere, where opposite points of
the equator are considered identical, with the
elliptic plane,
we see how two circles
there also can intersect in four real
points.
In the spherical case, by Chapter VIII, the Absolute is
the locus of all points which are identical with their equiva-
lents.
A
point
will
have
one
absolute
polar,
a
line two
equivalent absolute poles.
The absolute polar of a
circle
is
two equivalent circles, which are also the absolute polars of
the equivalent
circle.
Two
real
circles cannot intersect in
more than two
real
points.
Two circles which intersect in four points will have three

The problem of finding the common
secants of two conies will, in general, lead to an irreducible
equation of the third degree.
When, however, the two conies
have double contact with a third, the equation is reducible,
and one pair of secants appears which intersect on the chords
of contact, and are harmonically separated by them.*

of two

Note that a plane and point are special cases of the sphere.
The fixed point shall be called the centre, the plane of conical
contact the axial plane of the sphere.
A line connecting any
point with the centre of a sphere is perpendicular to the polar
plane of the point, a tangent plane is perpendicular to the line
from the point of contact to the centre, to the diameter through
the point of contact let us say.

We
shall terminate
this chapter by giving an unusually
elegant transformation from euclidean to non-euclidean space.*
Let us assume that we have a euclidean space where a point
has the homogeneous coordinates
#, y, 0,
t and a hyperbolic
space for which k* =
1, a point being given by our usual (x)
coordinates.
Let us then write
px
x^
py = &2 ,
pz
Vx*~x*--x*'-x*,
p = #
&J.
(8)
To
each
point
of
hyperbolic
space
will
correspond two
points of euclidean space.
Let us choose that
for which the
real part of Vx^x^
x^
x^
is greater than zero.
When
the real part vanishes, we may, by adjoining to our domain of
rationality a square root of minus one, distinguish between the
imaginary
roots, and so choose one in particular.
We may
thus say that to every point of hyperbolic space, not on the
Absolute, will correspond a point of euclidean space above
the
plane
z = 0, and
to
each
points
of the
Absolute will
correspond points of this plane.
The transformation
is real,
so that real and actual points
will correspond to real ones.
Conversely, we get from (8)
<T#O = x* + y
2 4-

-r
2
,
a&i = 2xt,
crx2 = 2yt,
*xz = a* + y* + z*-t* 9
(9)
and to each point of euclidean space, above, or on the z plane,
will correspond a point of hyperbolic space, not on, or on the
Absolute.
Suppose that we have a euclidean sphere of centre (a, b, c, d)
and radius r.
If we write for short
((6
2 + &2 + c2 -cZ2r2)=p
2
,
the equation of this sphere may be written
= 0.
(10)
* This transformation seems to have been first given in the second edition
of Wissenschaft und ffypothese, by Poincare, translated by F. and L. Lindemann,
Leipzig, 1906, p. 258.
This
is fruitfully used in the dissertation of Munich,
' Nicht-euklidische Cykliden/ Munich, 1906. We have adapted the notation
to conform to our own usage.

We have here two spheres which differ merely in the
coor-
dinate of their
centre,
i.e. two spheres which are
reflections
of one another in the
plane.
If the hyperbolic sphere were
real and actual, one of th6 euclidean spheres would lie wholly
above the o plane, and the other wholly below
it.
We may
say that (leaving aside special cases) a hyperbolic sphere will
correspond
to so much of a euclidean sphere as
is above or
in the
plane, and to the reflection in the
plane of so much
of the sphere as is below it.
A
euclidean sphere
for which
c = 0, that
is,
one whose
centre is in the
plane will correspond to a plane in hyperbolic
space, a hyperbolic sphere for which
that
is, one whose centre
is in the plane which corresponds
to the euclidean piano at
infinity, will correspond to a plane
in euclidean space.
A euclidean
circle perpendicular
to the
s plane will correspond to a hyperbolic line, a hyperbolic circle
which is perpendicular to the plane
(i
<i3= 0, will correspond
to a euclidean line.
We may go a step further in this direction.
Suppose that
we have two euclidean spheres given by an equation of the

gonal is that

But this gives immediately that the corresponding hyperbolic
spheres are
also mutually orthogonal; and
conversely.
We
thus have a correspondence of orthogonal spheres to orthogonal
spheres.
We
see
next
that
the
lines
of
curvature of any
surface will go into any lines of curvature of the corresponding
surface, and hence the Darboux-Dupin theorem must hold in
hyperbolic
space, namely,
in any
triply orthogonal system
of surfaces, the intersections are lines of curvature.
Were we willing to
sacrifice the real domain, we might in
a similar manner establish a correspondence between spheres
of euclidean and of elliptic space.

CHAPTER XII
CONIC
SECTIONS
THE study of the metrical properties of conies in the non-
euclidean plane, is, in the last analysis, nothing more nor less
than a study of the invariants and covariants of two conies.
We shall not, however, go into general questions of invariant
theory here, but rather try
to pick out those
metrical pro-
perties of non-euclidean conies which bear the closest analogy
to the corresponding euclidean properties.*
First of
all,
let us
classify our conies under the real con-
gruent group
; that
is, in relation to their intersections with
the Absolute.
This may be done
analytically by means of
Weierstrass's elementary divisors, but the geometric question
is so easy that we give the results merely.
We shall begin
with the real conies in the actual domain of hyperbolic space.
(1) Convex hyperbolas.
Four real absolute points, no real
absolute tangents.
Jl)
Concave
hyperbolas.
Four
real
absolute
points,
four
absolute tangents.
(3) Semi-hyperbolas.
Two real and two imaginary absolute
points and tangents.
(4)
Ellipses.
Four imaginary absolute points and tangents.
(5) Concave
hyperbolic
parabolas.
Two
coincident,
and
two real and distinct absolute points and tangents.
(6) Convex hyperbolic parabolas.
Two coincident, and two
real and
distinct absolute
points.
Two
coincident, and two
conjugate imaginary absolute tangents.
(7)
Elliptic parabolas.
Two coincident, and two conjugate
imaginary absolute points and tangents.
(8) Osculating parabolas.
Three
real
coincident, and one
real distinct absolute point, and the same for absolute tangents.
* The treatment of conies in the present chapter
is in close accord with
three articles by D'Ovidio, 'Le proprieta focali delle coniche,'
' Sulle coniche
confocali,' and 'Teoremi sulle coniche*, all in the Atti deUa R. Accademia

A
real central conic in the actual domain of the hyperbolic
plane
will have a common self-conjugate
triangle with the
Absolute which
is real, except in the case of the semi-hyper-
bola.
In the elliptic case
it will surely be real.
Taking this
as the coordinate triangle we may write the equation of the
Absolute in typical form, while that of the conic

CHAPTER XIII
QUADRIC SURFACES
THE discussion
of non-euclidean quadric surfaces may be
carried on in the same spirit as that of conic sections in the
preceding chapter.
There
is not, however, the same wealth
of easy and interesting theorems, owing to the greater com-
plication
in
the
formation
of
the
simultaneous
covariants
of two quadrics.
Let us begin by
classifying non-euclidean quadrics under
the group
of
real
congruent
transformations.*"
We begin
in the actual domain of hyperbolic space, giving only those
surfaces which have a real part in that domain and a non-
vanishing discriminant.
The names adopted are intended to
give a certain idea
of
the shape of the
surface.
We
shall
mean by

intersection of the surface and

It
is worth mentioning that the Clifford surface of elliptic
space has real linear generators, while that in hyperbolic space
has not.
Let
us next turn our attention to that
class of quadrics
which we have termed central, and which are distinguished
by the
existence
of
a
non- degenerate
tetrahedron
(in
the
protective vsense) self-conjugate with regard both to the surface
and the Absolute.
The vertices of this tetrahedron shall be
called the centres of the surface, and its planes the axial planes.
When this tetrahedron is chosen as the basis of the coordinate
system,
the
Absolute may
be
written
in
the
typical form
while the equation of the surface involves none but squared
terms.

which meet in a line of this
axial plane.
We
obtain a good
deal
of information about our central
quadrics by enumerating the Cayleyan characteristics of their
curves of intersection with the Absolute, and the corresponding
developables.
The
curve
is a
twisted quartic of deficiency
one.
Its
osculating developable
is of order eight and class
twelve.
It has sixteen stationary tangent planes, thirty-eight
lines in every plane lie in two osculating planes, two secants,
i.e. two lines meeting the curve twice, pass every point not on
the curve, sixteen points in every plane are the intersection of
two tangents, eight double tangent planes pass through every
point.
The
developable
will,
of
course,
possess
the
dual
characteristics.

an actual point, and that only two of those will cut the surface
in proper circles.*

if we have in mind that
our coordinate system

which are

It
is now
necessary
to
look more
closely
into the
signs
of the radicals in (15).
We know that, at least in a restricted
domain, three confocal quadrics will pass through each point.
In elliptic space one of these will be ruled, and the other two
not ruled
; assuming, of course, that we are dealing with the
case of central quadrics.
In hyperbolic space, two
possible
cases can arise in the actual domain.
If the developable be

xiii
QUADRIC SURFACES
167
real, two
ruled, and
one
non-ruled
hyperboloid
will
pass
through
each
point.
If
it be imaginary we
shall have an
ellipsoid, a
ruled, and
a
not-ruled
hyperboloid.*
Let
us
confine ourselves to this
case, taking A3 as the parameter of
the non-ruled hyperboloid, A2 as that of the ruled one, while Aj
gives the ellipsoid.
The elliptic case will follow immediately
if we suppress the word
hyperboloid substituting
ellipsoid,
In
(15)
let
us assume that A
refers
to an
ellipsoid, and
A'
to a ruled
hyperboloid.
In two of the
three
actual
axial
planes we shall have real focal conies.
There will be a real
focal
ellipse which, looked upon as an envelope, constitutes
the transition between the ellipsoid and the ruled hyperboloid.
It will be surrounded by all ellipsoids, and surround all ruled
hyperboloids.
If we take a point in this axial plane, without
the focal ellipse, the ellipsoid and non-ruled hyperboloid will
subsist, the ruled hyperboloid, looked upon as a point locus,
will shrink into the plane counted doubly.
The other real
focal conic will be a hyperbola, and will serve as a transition
between
the
two
sorts
of
hyperboloids,
looked
upon
as
envelopes.
It will surround the non-ruled hyperboloids, but
be surrounded by the ruled ones.
The plane counted doubly,
will replace a non-ruled hyperboloid for each point without
the hyperbola.
If a point be taken in the remaining axial
plane,
this
plane,
counted
doubly, will
replace a non-ruled
hyperboloid
for each
of
its
points.
Similar
considerations
will hold in the elliptic case.
Once more, let us look at the signs of the terms in
(15).
d\ i will change sign as a point passes through an axial plane
that counts doubly in the A
?: family, or when passing along
a tangent
to
one
of these
surfaces, the point of contact
is
traversed.
On the other hand we see from (14) that when
d\i changes sign, the radical associated with it in (15) changes
sign
also, and
vice
versa.
The radical associated with d\
?t
will change sign, as we pass through a point of the axial plane
with an imaginary focal conic (which we shall call
7r3), and
for a point of the axial plane
7r2 of the focal hyperbola, which
is without this hyperbola.
The radical with d\% will change
sign for points of
TT
I the plane of the focal ellipse without this
curve, or points of ?r2 within the focal hyperbola.
The radical
with d!A,
will change sign for points of
TTI within the focal
ellipse.
We next suppose that a loop of inextensible thread is slung
about an ellipsoid A, and a confocal, ruled, one-sheeted hyper-
boloid A', and pulled taut at a point P.
The loop is supposed
* See the Author's
l Quadric Surfaces', p. 1C5.

168
QUADRIC SURFACES
CH.
to surround the ellipsoid, so that it winds partly on each of
the portions of the hyperboloid, which, in a restricted domain,
are separated by the
ellipsoid.
The form for the element of
length throughout the whole string will be that given by (15).
For when we pass from the
ellipsoid to the hyperboloid we
pass along a
geodesic whose tangent touches both surfaces,
and
this
will be true throughout the
continuation of
that
geodesic, for a geodesic is traced by a line rolling on a quadric,
and
touching
a
confocal
one.
The same form of distance
element will hold
for the rectilinear parts of the loop.
We
see, moreover, that two, and only two surfaces, of a confocal
system will touch any line
; hence A and A' are the only two
which
will touch
the
rectilinear parts of the loop.
Lastly,
Jet us limit ourselves to those regions of the plane where the
various portions of the loop may be named in order
:
straight,
hyperboloidal, ellipsoidal, hyperboloidal, ellipsoidal, straight.
The constant length of the thread may be written
p

p*2

JA2
We see that F3 can never vanish, for A and X
7 are the para-
meters
of an
ellipsoid and
ruled hyperboloid
respectively,
while A3 refers to a non-ruled hyperboloid.
It will become
infinite four times, twice when the loop passes
7r2 the plane
of the focal hyperbola, and twice when it passes 7r3
.
We may,
however, integrate right up to these limits, and, as we have
seen, cZA3 changes sign with the radical.
We thus have

of the focal ellipse

It will vanish throughout those two
portions of the loop that lie on the ruled hyperboloid A2 = A',
and these two are separated by an intersection with

We must, in conclusion, consider the first integral.
It will
never become infinite, but will vanish along those two portions
of
the

lie

We have therefore,
since the
first two integrals and the
sum are constant,

and the locus of the moving point is an ellipsoid.
Lastly, let
the ellipsoid and hyperboloid shrink down to the focal ellipse
and focal hyperbola respectively, we have in the limiting case
:
Theorem 9.
If an ellipse and hyperbola in mutually perpen-
dicular planes pass each through two
foci of the other, and
if a loop
of inextensible thread be slung around the
ellipse
and
pulled taut at a point P in such a way that
it meets
the two curves
alternately, then the locus of P will be an
ellipsoid confocal with the given ellipse and hyperbola.

CHAPTER XIV
AREAS AND VOLUMES
THE
subjects
urea
and volume
offer
some
of
the
most
striking
points
of
disparity
between
euclidean and
non-
euclidean geometry.*
A
first notable
difference arises from
the fact that, in the non-euclidean cases, two different func-
tions of a triangle appear to play the role of the euclidean
area.
The
first
is present in the analoga of those formulae
which give the area in terms of the
sides and angles
;
the
second
appears when the
area
is
defined as the limit of a
sum,
i. e. as a
definite
integral.
We shall reserve the name
area
for the second
of these, giving
to
the
first the name
amplitude.^
Let
us, as
in elementary geometry, use the
letters A, B, C
to indicate, either the vertices of a
triangle, or the measures
of
its
angles.
We assume that these
points are
real,
and,
in the hyperbolic case,
situated
in the actual domain.
We
shall
define
triangle
as
in
Chapter
II.
We
might
carry
through
the same
sort
of work
for any
three
points,
but.
as we saw in the
closing pages of Chapter VII, we should
thereby be
compelled,
in the
hyperbolic
case
at
least,
to
introduce certain very delicate considerations as to algebraic
sign, not only in our analytic expressions, but even in the
trigonometric formulae first introduced in Chapter IV.

We
shall
define as
the area
of an
infinitesimal
triangle
the common value of k2 times
its excess,
its half-amplitude,
and the euclidean expression for its area.
Theorem
2.
If
the
opposite
sides
of
an
infinitesimal
quadrilateral do not intersect in points
infinitesimally near
the vertices, the limit of the ratio of the areas of the triangles
into which it is divided by a diagonal is unity.
The sum of these two infinitesimal
areas
shall be called
the area of the
infinitesimal quadrilateral
;
it will be equal
(always
neglecting
infinitesimals
of
higher
order)
to
the
product of two adjacent sides multiplied into the sine of the
included angle.
Suppose now that we have a region of the plane, connex
right up to the boundary, which
is limited by one or more
closed curves, and
let this be covered by a network
of
in-
finitesimal quadrilaterals of the sort just described.
Let the
area of each of these be multiplied by the value
for a point
therein
of a continuous function
of the
coordinates
of the
point.
The
limit of this sum as
the
individual
areas tend
uniformly toward zero shall be called the surface integral of
the
given
function
for the
given
area.
The
proof
of the
existence of such a
limit, and
its independence of network
employed will be identical with that used
in the correspond-
ing euclidean case, and need not detain us here.*
Definition. When the
surface
integral
of the
function
1
exists over a region of the plane, that integral shall be defined
as the area of the region.
Theorem 3. The area of a region of a plane
is the sum of
the areas of any two regions into which
it may be divided
provided that these two have no common area.
This follows immediately from the definition given above.
As an application of these principles
let us determine the

area of a triangle*
It
is the limit of the sum of the areas of
a
network
of
infinitesimal
triangles,
or by
(1)
the
limit
of the sum of k2 times
their excesses.
Now
it
is perfectly
clear that if a triangle be divided in two by a segment whose
extremities are a vertex and a point of the opposite
side, the
excess of the original triangle
is the sum of the excesses of
the
parts, and we may establish our network by a repetition
of this process or division, hence *
Theorem
4,
The area of a triangle
is the quotient of the
excess divided by the measure of curvature of space,
Let us
give a second demonstration of this fundamental
theorem with the aid of integration.
It will be sufficient to
do so in the case of a right triangle, and we shall take a right
triangle with one angle at C the intersection of xl = 0, x% = 0,
the right angle being at B a point of the axis x2 = 0.

cit. Manning,

is
scarcely disguised.
In Clebsch-Lendemann, Vorlesungen iiber Geometrie, Leipzig,
1891, vol. ii, p. 49, is a proof by integration, but the analysis
is unnecessarily
complicated owing to the fact that, apparently, the author overlooked the
consideration that it is sufficient to prove the theorem for a right triangle.

Two regions with the same area may, naturally, have very

There

however,
three
simple
cases
where the equivalence of area
is immediately evident.
First,
where the two figures are congruent
; second, when they are
composed of the same number of non-overlapping sub-regions
(i. e. sub-regions no two of which have
in common a region
which has an area) congruent in pairs
;
third, where by the
adjunction
of
pairs
of mutually congruent non-overlapping
sub-regions to them, they may be transformed into congruent
regions.
In this latter case they may be said to be equivalent
by completion.*

convex polygon or, more simply, a polygon.
The definition
of sides, vertices, and angles is immediate.
If one vertex, say
A 19
be connected with
all
the
others,
the polygon
will be
divided into 71
2 triangles, no two of which have in common
any area.
The area of the polygon will thus be the sum of
the areas of these
triangles.
We may convince ourselves of
the compatibility of these statements as follows.
A triangle
is certainly a polygon, and
if a polygon of n
1 sides exist,
we may easily enlarge
it to have n sides by taking an addi-
tional vertex near one side.
On the other hand, if a polygon
of ?i-~l
sides may be divided up in the manner suggested,
it
is immediately evident
that one
of n
sides may
be
so
divided also.

the excess of the sum of its angles over (71

Following our previous analogy, suppose that we have
six
planes, no three coaxal, passing by fours through four actual
or
ideal, but not collinear points.
Let the remaining inter-
sections be at a finite distance from the three chosen points,
but
infinitesimally
near
one
another.
An
infinitesimal
region
will thus be formed, on the analogy of a euclidean
parallelepiped, which may be divided into
six
tctrahedra of
such sort that the limit 01 the ratio of the sine amplitudes, or
of the euclidean volumes, of any two is unity.
Six times the
euclidean volume of any one of these tetrahedra may be defined
as the euclidean volume of the region.
So far the analogy between two and three dimensions has
been
sufficiently good.
Each time we have had a function
called sine amplitude corresponding in many particulars
to
a simple multiple of the euclidean area or volume, and ap
proaching
a
multiple
of
the
area
or volume
as
a
limit,
when the figure becomes infinitesimal.
In
the plane
there
appeared, besides half the
sine amplitude and the euclidean
area, a third expression, namely, the
discrepancy or
excess.
In three dimensions this function
is, sad to
relate,
entirely
lacking
;
that
is to
say, there
is no
simple function of the
measures of a tetrahedron which possesses the property that
when one tetrahedron
is the
logical sum of two
others, the
function of the sum
is the sum of the functions.
It
is the
lack
of
this
function
that
renders
the
problem
of
non-
euclidean volumes difficult.*
Suppose,
in
general, that we
have
a three
dimensional
region connex up
to
the boundary, and
that we divide
it
* It is highly interesting that in four dimensions a function playing the
role of the discrepancy appears once more.

into a number of extremely tiny tetrahedra.
The limit of
the sum of the euclidean volume
of each, multiplied by the
value
for
a
point
therein of a continuous
function
of
the
coordinates
of that point, as
all the volumes approach zero
uniformly, shall be called the volume integral for that region
of that function.
The proofs for the existence of that volume
integral, and
its independence of the method of subdivision,
are analogous
to
those already
referred
to
for
the
surface
integral.
In particular, the volume integral of the function
unity shall be called the volume of the region.
Two regions
will have the same volume
if they be congruent, made up
of the same number
of
parts, mutually congruent in
pairs,
or if by the adjunction of such pairs they may be completed
to be congruent.
If the limiting surface of a region be made up of a series of
plane surfaces, and
if no
line, not lying in a plane
of the
surface, can contain more than two points of the surface, then
it
is easy to show that the region may be divided up into a
number of tetrahedra, and the problem of finding the volume of
any such region reduces to the problem of finding the volume
of a
tetrahedron.
This problem may, in
turn,
be reduced
to that of finding the volume of a tetrahedron of particularly
simple structure.
To begin with, we may assume that there
is one face which makes with the three others dihedral angles
whose
measures
are
less
than
->
for
the
bisectors
of
the
dihedral angles of the original tetrahedron will always divide
it into smaller tetrahedra possessing this property.
The per-
pendicular on the plane of this face, from the opposite vertex,
will, then, pass through a point within the face, and, with the
help
of
this
perpendicular, we may
subdivide
into
three
smaller tetrahedra, for each of which the line of one edge
is
perpendicular to the plane of one face.
Consider,
next, a tetrahedron where the line of one edge
is indeed perpendicular to
the plane
of a
face.
There are
two
possibilities.
First, in the plane of this face neither of
the
face
angles
whose
vertex
is
not
at
the
foot
of the
perpendicular
is
obtuse
;
secondly, one
of
these
angles
is
obtuse.
(The case where both were obtuse could not occur
in a small region.)
In the
first case we might draw a line
from the foot of the perpendicular to a point of the opposite
edge
in
this
particular
face,
perpendicular
to
the
line
of
that
edge, and
thus, by a
familiar theorem
in elementary
geometry,
which
holds
equally
in
the
non-euclidean
case,
divide the tetrahedron into two others, each of which possesses

xiv
AREAS AND VOLUMES
183
the
property
that the
lines
of two opposite edges are per-
pendicular to two of the faces.
These we shall for the moment
all simplest type.
In the second case, from the vertex of the
obtuse angle mentioned, draw a line perpendicular to the line
of
the
opposite
edge
in
this
particular
face
(and passing
through a point within this edge), and connect the intersection
with the vertex opposite this
face.
The tetrahedron will be
divided up into a tetrahedron of the simplest type, and one
of the sort considered in case
1.
We have, then, merely to
consider the volume of a tetrahedron of the simplest type.
Let the vertices of the tetrahedron be J., J5, (7, 7), where AB
is perpendicular to BCD and DC perpendicular to ABC.
Let a
plane perpendicular to AB contain a point Bl of (AB) whose
distance from A shall have the measure x
; while this plane
meets (AC) and (AD) in Cl and Dl respectively.
The volume
of the region bounded by this plane, and an adjacent one of
the same type and the three faces through J., will be dx, mul-
tiplied by the surface integral over the A Bl Cl Dl of the cosine
of the
fcth part of the distance of a point from Blt
(Cf. Ch.
IV.
(2).)
This integral takes a striking form.*
Let
the
distance from Bl

; it was originally
written in 1855, when the science of non-euciidean geometry had not reached
*
its present recognition.
It
is very general, extremely difficult reading, and
hampered by a fearful and wonderful terminology, e. g. our tetrahedron of the
simplest type is a special case of an Artiothoscheme.
It
is, however, a striking
piece of geometrical work.

CHAPTER XV
INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY
THE task which we shall undertake in the present chapter
is to develop the differential geometry of curves and surfaces
in non-euclidean space.*
We shall introduce a notable sim-
plification
in our work by abandoning homogeneous
coor-
dinates, and assuming that
(xx) = W.
(1)
In the elliptic case we shall take XQ ^
; in the hyperbolic,
X Q =
, XQ j>
for all real points.
Of course in exceptional cases, where we wish to include
points
of
the Absolute
or beyond,
this
proceeding
is not
legitimate
; we shall therefore assume, unless we specifically
state the contrary, that we are limiting ourselves to a real
region, where no absolute or ultra infinite points are included
in
the
hyperbolic
case.
We
shall,
further,
have

the
distance of two points (#), (#').

shall assume from here on that when we

Let us imagine that at a chosen point of a curve, say P, a
tangent is drawn.
We shall take two near points P' and P"
on the curve and tangent respectively, so situated near P and
on the same side of the normal plane that PP' = PP".

2.
The square of the curvature of a curve
is the
square of its curvature treated as a curve in a four-dimensional
euclidean space, minus the measure of curvature of the non-
euclidean space.
It
will be convenient to
consider,
besides our point
(x),
three other points allied to
it.
(t) shall be orthogonal to (x)
and on the
tangent,
(0) orthogonal
to
(x) on
the
principal
normal, and ()
orthogonal
to
(x) on the binormal.
These
three will replace the direction cosines of tangent, principal
normal, and
binormal, which
figure
so prominently in the
euclidean theory.
In hyperbolic space these points lie without
the actual domain to which we suppose (x) confined.

Theorem
3.
The torsion at a general point of a curve
is
positive when the relative moment of a ray thence to a point
on the positive part of the curve, and a ray from a point on
the positive part of the tangent to one on the positive part of
the principal normal
is negative
; when the latter product
is
positive, the torsion is negative.
Intuitively stated
this means that
the torsion
is
positive
when
the
curve
resembles
a

otherwise
negative.

that
the

of
the

arc, the tangent plane may be

At any general point of the surface,

tangents
is made up
of mutually

tangents,
there will be just two tangents which are mutually conjugate
and
mutually

these
give
the
elements

easily be
put on a sound analytical basis.

The vanishing of D' and ^ proves our theorem.
Our state-
ment in Chapter XIII that confocal quadrics intersect in lines
of curvature is hereby justified.
A surface
all of whose curves are lines of curvature must
be a sphere.
The normal at any point P will determine, with
any other point Q of the surface, a plane.
The normals to
the surface along this curve, will, by hypothesis, generate an
evolute, and hence, by (7) make a fixed angle with the plane
;
and this angle must be null,
since, by hypothesis, one normal
lies in the plane.
Hence the normals at P and Q intersect, or
all normals must
pass
through one
point.
Evidently the
orthogonal surface to a bundle of concurrent lines is a sphere.
Let us suppose that we have a conformal transformation of
space.
It
will carry a triply orthogonal system of surfaces
into another such system, hence a line of curvature into a line
of
curvature.
It
will,
therefore,
carry any
surface
all
of
whose curves are lines of curvature into another such surface,
hence
Theorem
11.
Every
conformal
transformation
of
space
carries a sphere into a sphere.
Of course a plane
is here regarded as a
special case of a
sphere.

Theorem
15.
The two asymptotic
lines at a
point, when
real,
have
torsions
equal
to
the
two
square
roots
of
the
negative of the total relative curvature of the surface.
Theorem
16.
In any
surface
of
constant
total
relative
curvature,
the
torsion of every asymptotic
line
is constant
and equal to a square root of the total relative curvature, and
the necessary and
sufficient condition that a surface should
have constant total relative curvature
is that the asymptotic
lines of one set should have constant
torsion.
Under these
circumstances the asymptotic lines of the other set will have a
constant torsion equal to the negative of that already given,
and
the
square
of either torsion
will be the
total
relative
curvature.
In speaking
of the
total curvature
of a
surface we have
used the word relative.
It
is now time to explain why that
adjective
is chosen.
Let us try to express our total relative
curvature in terms of E, F, G and their derivatives. We have

The total relative curvature of a surface is

and the measure of curvature of space.
The

Theorem 19.* The horocyclic surface of hyperbolic space
is
developable on the euclidean plane.
In
elliptic
space
there
is
a
peculiarly
notable
class
of
surfaces of Gaussian curvature zero, ruled surfaces.
We have
already seen one example, the Clifford Surface of Chapter X.
This
quadric,
be
it remembered,
cuts the
Absolute
in two
generators
of each
set, and
its own generators form an
or-
thogonal
system.
Now Dupin's
indicatrix shows
that
the
normal
sections
of
greatest and
of
least curvature will
be
determined
by
tangents
bisecting
the
angles
of
the
two
generators, and the planes of these normal sections will cut
the surface in two circles whose axes are the axes of revolution
of the
surface, and whose
centres
lie on
these
axes.
The
centres are thus mutually orthogonal points, hence the
total
relative curvature is
7 2

This statement was given without proof in Chapter X.
We
notice also that the generators of either
set
are
paratactic,
and the
question
arises, will not
this
fact alone
constitute
a
sufficient
condition
that
a
surface should have Gaussian
curvature zero ?

INTRODUCTION TO
CH.
Let us imagine that we have a
surface
generated by
co 1
paratactic lines.*
The parameter v shall give the actual dis-
tance measured on each line from an orthogonal trajectory
v = const.
We have for our distance element
We know, moreover, by Chapter IX that
if two
lines be
paratactic
they have
an
infinite number
of common
per-
pendiculars
on which
they
determine
congruent
distances.
Hence E is a function of u alone, and we may choose
11 so
that it shall be equal to unity
ds2 =du2 + dv*,
(27)
and the Gaussian curvature is zero.
Conversely,
suppose
that we
have
a
ruled
surface
of
Gaussian curvature
zero.
The square of the element of arc
may be written
Since the Gaussian curvature is zero
On the other hand we may write our surface parametrically
in the form

and this shows that two adjacent generators determine equal
distances

so
are

Theorem
20.
The necessary and
sufficient condition that
a ruled surface in elliptic space should have Gaussian curva-
ture zero is that its generators should be paratactic.

; the

If we compare
theorems 16 and 21, we get

Theorem 22.
The necessary and
sufficient condition that
it should be possible to assemble the normals to a surface into
one parameter families of left (right) paratactics,
is that the
given surface should have Gaussian curvature
zero.
It will,
then,
be
possible
to assemble
the normals
into
families
of
right
(left) paratactics
also.
The intersections of the given
surface with the
various families of paratactics will be the
asymptotic lines of the former.
We
shall,
as
in
euclidean
space,
define as
the
geodesic
curvature at any point of a curve on our surface, the curvature
of its orthogonal projection on the tangent plane at that point.

Theorem
23.
The curve of shortest
length between two
points of a surface is a geodesic line.
Remembering 21, we have further
Theorem
24.
The orthogonal
trajectories
of a
family
of
paratactic
lines
are
geodesies
of
the
surface
generated by
these
lines.
If we consider the two planes through
the normal
to
a
surface and
the two tangents to the
lines of curvature, we
see
that
they
are
mutually
perpendicular,
and
that
each
touches the focal
surface of the congruence of normals at the
point of intersection of the two adjacent normals in the other
plane.*
Theorem
25.
In any congruence of normals, the edges of
regression
of the developable
surfaces
are
geodesies
of the
focal surfaces of the congruence.
The osculating plane to any straight line
is indeterminate
;
the line
is, therefore, a geodesic for
all space
; a
result also
evident from
Chapter
II.
30.
It
is
also
clear that as
the
expressions for the geodesic curvature of a parameter line
in
terms of E, F, G and their derivatives are the same in cuclidean
and in non-euclidean space, and the formula for the distance
element
is written in the same shape, so will the formula for
the geodesic curvature of any curve be the same.
We might,
for instance, have given this formula in terms of the Beltrami
invariants.
We have, however, purposely avoided the intro-
duction
of these
into
the
present work, and will
therefore
merely refer the reader to the current textbooks in differential
geometry, f
As a
last problem in the differential geometry of surfaces
let us take up that of minimal surfaces.
To begin with, what
will be the element of area ?
It
is perfectly clear that the
expression for this will be the same as that in the euclidean
case.
The
sine of the angle formed by the parameter lines
will be, by (15)

If wo
define
as
a
minimal
surface
one where
the
first
variation of the area
is
zero, certainly a necessary condition,
we have
Theorem 26. The necessary and
sufficient condition that a
surface should be minimal
is that the mean relative curvature
should be zero.
We see from (23) that the numerator of the expression for
the
relative mean
curvature
is
the
simultaneous
invariant
of
(13) and
(20), and
vanishes when,
and only when,
the
tangents to
the asymptotic
lines are harmonically separated
by those to the isotropic ones, hence
Theorem 27. The necessary and sufficient condition that a
surface should be minimal is that the asymptotic lines should
form an orthogonal system.
This theorem justifies our statement in Chapter X that a
Clifford surface
is a minimal surface.
It is very interesting
that
in
non-euclidean
space we
should
have
an
algebraic
minimal surface (other than the plane) whose order
is as low
as two.
We may go one long step further towards the
solution of
the problem
of minimal surfaces, namely,
exhibit the
differ-
ential equations on which they depend.*
We
shall once more take as parameter lines the isotropic
ones.
These will form a
conjugate
system,
since they are
harmonically separated by the asymptotic lines, hence

CHAPTER XVI

IN Chapter IX we gave the foundations of the Pluckerian
line-geometry, and the fundamental invariants of a metrical
character
; in Chapter X we saw what advantages arose from
taking the
cross
instead of the line
as element, and
intro-
ducing suitable coordinates.
Chapter XV was given to the
differential geometry of curves and surfaces.
It is the object
of the present chapter to draw all of these threads together
into a theory of differential line-geometry, and, in particular,
a theory of two-parameter line systems or congruences.*
We shall define as an analytic
line-congruence a
system
whose
Pluckerian coordinates are analytic functions
of two
independent parameters, say u and v.
This
is equivalent to
supposing that our lines are determined by two points, which
we may assume mutually orthogonal, whose coordinates aro
analytic
functions
of
the two
independent
parameters
in
question.

We remember from Chapter IX, that two lines which are
not paratactic have two common perpendiculars meeting them
in
pairs
of mutually orthogonal
points.
Let
us,
as a
first
problem,
find where the common perpendicular to a line of
our congruence and an adjacent
line meets
the given
line.
The
coordinates
of an arbitrary point
of our
line may be
written (#cos- + y sin -

arbitrary
point
of an
adjacent line will be X(x + dx) + ^(y + dy).

We shall now abandon the general congruence and assume
that, contrary to
There are two sharply
distinct sub- cases which must not
be confused
:
In either case,
as we readily see,
(11) is illusory, and there
is no ruled quartic determined by the common perpendiculars
to a line and its neighbours
;
these perpendiculars will either
all meet
the given
line at one
of two mutually orthogonal

common perpendiculars.
Our condition for focal points expressed in (23) was inde-
pendent of
(12), and
this shows that our two sub-cases just
mentioned differ in this, that the first
is a normal congruence,
while the second
is
not.

(x) be a point where our

set of perpendiculars,
(y) being thus the other such
point.
Then under our first hypothesis, we shall have

We see that the focal points will fall into (x) and (y) likewise.
These are mutually orthogonal, and so by equation (26) of the
last Chapter, that the total relative curvature of the surface
will be

We see also by
k
theorem (22) of that chapter that it is possible to assemble the
lines of our congruence into families of left or right paratactics
according as we assemble them by means of the one or the
other set of asymptotic lines of the given surface.
Conversely,

226

if we have given a congruence

Conversely, when such
is the case, we must have (dxdy) = 0.

to a surface of Gaussian curvature zero, is that it should consist

In elliptic (or spherical) space, there is advantage in study-
ing our

We saw in Chapter X that, interpreted in cross coordinates,
those are the equations which characterize an improper cross
of the second
sort, which
is made up of a pencil of tangents
to the Absolute.
Such a pencil we may also call an improper
ray of the second sort.
Let us see under what circumstances
such a ray (uz) will intersect a proper ray (uV) orthogonally.
Geometrically, we see that either the proper ray must
pass
through the vertex of the pencil, or lie in the plane thereof,
and analytically we shall have
Uji62 4- 1 = %iZ2 + 1=0.
There are four solutions to these equations.

Theorem 16.*
The necessary and
sufficient condition that
the opposite of a
real ray of an isotropic congruence should
also belong thereunto is that the ray should be coplanar with
an improper ray
of the
second
sort belonging
to
the con-
gruence.
When the latter are present in infinite number in an
irreducible congruence, the congruence contains the opposite
of each of its rays.
The two cases here given may be
still more sharply
dis-
tinguished by geometrical considerations.
The focal surface
of an isotropic congruence
is a developable circumscribed to
the Absolute, and will have a real equation when the con-
gruence is real.
There are two distinct possibilities
;
first, the
equation of this surface
is reducible in the rational domain
;
second,
it
is not.
In the first case the surface
is made up of
two conjugate imaginary portions
; in the second there
is one
portion which
is
its own conjugate imaginary.
In the
first
case there will be a
finite number of planes which touch the
Absolute and also each of the two portions of the focal surface
at the same point, namely, those which touch the Absolute
at the points of intersection of the two curves of contact with
the two portions
of the
focal
surface.
In these planes only
shall we have improper rays of the second sort belonging to
the congruence.
If, on the other hand, the focal surface be
irreducible, every point of the curve of contact may bo looked
upon
as being
in
the
intersection
of two
adjacent
planes
tangent
to the Absolute, and the
focal
surface which
is
its
own
conjugate
imaginary.
The
tangents
at each
of
these
points will be improper rays of the second
sort
of the con-
gruence.
Theorem 17 may now be given in a better form.
Theorem
17.
The
necessary and
sufficient
condition
that
an
isotropic congruence should contain the opposite of each
of its rays is that the focal surface should be irreducible.
It
is very easy to observe
the distinction between the two
cases in the case of the linear function

it will be seen that if we write

is
well known * that a congruence of the second order and fourth
class has no focal surface, but a focal curve composed
of two
conies,
so
our present congruence
has
as
focal surface two
conjugate imaginary quadric cones which are circumscribed
to the Absolute.
When their conjugate imaginary centres fall
together in a real point, we revert to the previous case.
When
(u)
and
(z)
are
connected by the
vanishing
of a
polynomial of order m in i^ and order n in zv
in the general
case where
(31)
does
not hold
identically, we
shall
have
a line-congruence of order (m-f w)
2
.
When, however, (31) does
hold, we must subtract from
this
the
order of the curve of
contact of the focal surface and Absolute, and then divide by
2 to allow for the
fact that there are two opposite rays on
each line.
If tt-j be a function of ^
l
that possesses an
essential singu-
larity corresponding to a certain value of zl} we see that as u^
takes all possible values (except at most two) in the immediate
neighbourhood, there will be a whole bundle of right paratactic
lines in the congruence.
If % be
periodic, there will be an
infinite number of lines of the congruence
left paratactic
to
each line thereof.
If it 1 be one of the functions of the regular
bodies, we have a congruence which
is transformed into
itself
by a group of orthogonal substitutions in
( rA
r
),
i. e. by a group
of left translations.
We have
still
to consider the congruence of normals
to a
surface of Gaussian curvature zero in ray coordinates.
Here
there
will be
oo 1
paratactics of each
sort
to each
line.
We
may therefore express faX) and
( rX) each as functions of one
independent variable, or merely write
tdX^XJ = t(,XlrXtrX.J = 0.
(32)
All our work here developed for the elliptic case may be
brought into immediate relation with the hyperbolic case, and
in so doing we
shall get
to the inmost kernel of the whole
matter.
The parameters u l v 2
will determine
generators of
the
left representing
sphere.
They
have,
however,
a more
direct significance.
For if it2 remain constant while t^ varies,
the left paratactics to the ray in question passing through the
point (1, 0, 0, 0) will trace a pencil, and this pencil will
lie in

a plane tangent to the Absolute, for there
is only one value
for Uj, namely, --
, which will make the moving ray tangent
'1^2
to the Absolute.
When, therefore, u2 is
fixed, one of the
left
generators of the Absolute met by the ray in question is fixed,
and this shows that u lu2 are the parameters determining the
left generators which
the ray intersects, while
zl z2 in
like
manner determine the right generators.
If two rays meet the same two generators of one set they
are paratactic,
i. e. their lines are.
If they meet the same two
generators of different sets, they are either parallel or pseudo-
parallel.
The conditions for parallelism or pseudo-parallelism
will be that two rays shall have the same value
for one (u)
and for one (z).
Let
us,
in
fact, assume that the subscripts
are assigned to the
letters u^u^ z^2 in such a way that a
direct conformal
transformation,
or
isotropic congruence,
is
given by equations (29).
Such a congruence will contain cc 1
rays pseudo-parallel to a given ray, but only a
finite number
parallel
to
it.
The
conditions
for
pseudo-parallelism
will
thus be
On the other hand
a
pseudo-isotropic congruence
will be
given by (30), and the conditions for parallelism will be

To
pass
to
the hyperbolic
case,
let
us now assume
that
(lX) (rX) are two points of the hyperbolic Absolute, and that,
taken in order, they give a ray from dX) to
(rX).
Two rays
will be parallel if
(,Z) = OZ') or
(rX]
i =
(rX').
Equations (33) will give the conditions for parataxy, while
(34) give those for pseudo-parallelism.
We might push the
matter
still further by
distinguishing between syntaxy and
anti-taxy,
synparallelism and anti-parallelism, but we
shall
not enter into such questions
here.
Equations (29) will give
a congruence whose rays can be assembled into surfaces with
paratactic generators,
i. e. a congruence of normals to a surface
of Gaussian curvature zero
;
(30) will give an isotropic con-
gruence, while
(32) will give a pseudo-isotropic congruence.
We may tabulate our results as follows.*

CHAPTEK XVII
MULTIPLY CONNECTED SPACES
IN Chapters
I and II we
laid down a system of axioms
for our fundamental objects points and distances, and showed
how, thereby, we might build up the geometry of a restricted
region.
We also saw that with the addition of an assumption
concerning
the sum
of the angles
of a
single
triangle, we
were in a position to develop fully the
elliptic, hyperbolic,
or
euclidean geometry
of the
restricted region in question.
Our
spaces
so
defined were
not, however,
perfect
analytic
continua, even in the real domain.
To reach such continua
it was necessary to assume that any chosen segment might
be extended beyond
either extremity by a chosen amount.
We saw
in
the beginning of Chapter VII that this assump-
tion, though allowable in the euclidean and hyperbolic cases,
will involve a contradiction when added to the assumptions
already made for elliptic space.
The difficulty was overcome
by assuming
the existence
of a space
which
contained
as
sub-regions
(called
c,onsisteut
reyious)
spaces
where
our
previous axioms held good.
For this new type of space we
set up our Axioms
I'-VI'.
Our next task was to show that under Axioms I'-V each
point will surely have one set of homogeneous coordinates (#),
and conversely, to each set of real coordinates subject to the
restriction that in hyperbolic space
IPx* + x^ -f x./ H-
3
2 < 0,
in elliptic space
(,cx) > 0,
and in euclidean space
x ^ 0,
there
will
surely
correspond
one
real
point.
Under
the
euclidean
or
hyperbolic
hypotheses
each
set
of
real
coor-
dinates can correspond to one real point, at most
; under the
elliptic hypothesis, on
the
contrary, we found
it necessary
to
distinguish between
elliptic
space where but
one point
goes with each coordinate
set, and the spherical case where
two equivalent points necessarily have the same coordinates.
One further point was established in connexion with these
developments
; to each point there will correspond but a single
set of homogeneous coordinates (x).
The proof of this depended

OH. xvii
MULTIPLY CONNECTED SPACES
237
upon Axiom VI', which required that a congruent transforma-
tion
of one
consistent
region
should
produce one
definite
transformation
of
space
as
a
whole.
Of course
such
an
assumption, when
applied
to
our
space
of
experience,
can
neither be proved nor disproved empirically.
In the present
chapter we shall set ourselves the task of examining whether,
under Axioms I'-V of Chapter VII,
it be possible to have
a space where each point shall correspond to several sets of
coordinate values.*
For simplicity we shall assume that no
two different points can have the same coordinates.
What will be the meaning of the statement that under our
net of axioms two
sets of coordinate values
(#),
(x
f
) belong
to the same point?
Let a coordinate system be
set up, as
in Chapter V, in some consistent region;
let
this region be
connected with the given point by two different sets of over-
lapping
consistent
regions
;
then
(x) and
(x')
shall be two
different sets of coordinate values for this point, obtained by
two different sets of analytic extension of the original coor-
dinate system.
Let us first assume that there is a consistent region which
is reached by each chain of overlapping consistent regions,
a statement which will always hold true when there is a single
point
so reached.
We may
set up a
coordinate system
in
this region, and then make successive analytic extensions for
the change of axes from one
to another of the overlapping
consistent
regions,
until we
have
run
through
the
whole
circuit, and come back to the
region
in which we
started.
If, then, one point of the region have different values for
its
coordinates from what
it had at the
start, the same will be
true of all, or all but a finite number of points of the region,
and the new coordinate values will be obtained from the old
ones (in the non-euclidean cases) by means of an orthogonal
substitution.
If
(x) and
(x} be two
sets of coordinates
for
one point we
shall have
0..3
Conversely, if these equations hold for any point, they will
represent an identical transformation of the region, and give
two sets of coordinate values for every point of the region.

is in close accord with Killing, Die Orundlagen der
Geometric, Paderborn, 1898, Part iv.

'Forms of Non-Euclidean-Space', published in Lectures on Mathematics, Woods,
Van Vlock, and White, New York, 1905.

238
MULTIPLY CONNECTED SPACES
CH.
We see also by analytic extension that these equations
will
give two sets of coordinate values for every point in space.
There
is one possible variation in our axioms which should
be mentioned at this point.
It is entirely
possible to build
up a geometrical system where IV holds in general only,
and there are
special
points,
called singular points, which
can
lie in two consistent regions which have no sub-region
in common.
In two dimensions we have a simple example
in
the
case
of
the
geometry
of
the
euclidean
cone
with
a singular
line.
We
shall, however, exclude this possibility
by sticking closely to our axioms.
Let us suppose that we have two overlapping systems of
consistent regions going from the one wherein our coordinate
axes were set up to a chosen point P.
We may connect P
with a chosen point A
of the original
region by two con-
tinuous curves, thus making,
in
all, a continuous
loop.
If
now, PJ
be a point which
will have two
different
sets
of
coordinate
values, according
as we arrive
at
it by the one
or the other set of extensions, we see that our loop is of a sort
which cannot be reduced
in
size beyond a
definite amount
without losing
its characteristic property.
This shows
that,
in the sense of analysis situs, our space is multiply connected.
In speaking of spaces which obey Axioms I'-V, but where
each
point can
have
several
sets
of coordinate
values, we
shall use the term 'multiply connected spaces.
Suppose that we have a third set of coordinate values for
a
point
of our
consistent region.
These
will
be connected
with the second
set by a relation
0..3
t
We see that (x") and
(x) are also connected by a relation
of this type, hence
Theorem 1. The assemblage of all coordinate transformations
which
represent the

xvn
MULTIPLY CONNECTED SPACES
239
consistent region with the same coordinate values, which we
have seen is impossible (Chapter VII).
For
the sake
of clearness in our subsequent work
let us
introduce, besides our multiply connected space $, a space 2,
having the same
value
for the
constant k
as our
space
S,
and giving to each point one set of coordinate values only.
The
group
of
identical
transformations
of 8
will
appear
in 2 as a group of congruent transformations, a group which
has the property that none of
its transformations can leave
a real point of the actual domain invariant, nor produce an
infinitesimal transformation
of that domain.
We lay stress
upon the actual domain of 2, for in 8 we are interested in
actual
points
only.
Let us further
define
as fundamental
such a region of 2, that every point of 2 has an equivalent
in this region under the congruent sub-group which we are
now considering, yet no two points of a fundamental region
are
equivalent
to
one
another.
The
points
of 8 may
be
put
into one to one correspondence with those of a funda-
mental
region
of
this
sort
or
of
a
portion
thereof,
and,
conversely, such a fundamental region will furnish an example
of a multiply connected space obeying Axioms I'-V.
Theorem 2. Every real group of congruent transformations
of euclidean, hyperbolic, or elliptic space, which
carries the
actual domain into
itself, and none of whose members leave
an
actual
point
invariant, nor
transport
such a point an
infinitesimal amount, may be taken as the group of identical
transformations of a multiply connected space whose points
may be put into one to one correspondence with the points
of a portion of any fundamental domain of the given space
for that group.
Our interest will, from now on, centre in the space 2.
We
shall also find it advisable to treat the euclidean and the two
non-euclidean cases separately.
We shall begin by asking what groups of congruent trans-
formations of the euclidean plane
fulfil the requirements
of
Theorem 2.
Every congruent transformation of the euclidean
plane
is either a translation or a rotation, but the latter type
is inadmissible for our present purpose.
What then are the
groups of translations of the euclidean plane ?
The simplest
is evidently composed of the repetitions of a single translation.
If the amplitude of the translation be
I, while n is an integer,
positive or negative, this group may be expressed in the form
x'~x + nlt
2/=2/.
The
fundamental
regions
will be

240
MULTIPLY CONNECTED SPACES
CH.
parallel to the y axis, each strip including one of the bounding
lines. A corresponding space 8 will be furnished by a euclidean
cylinder of circumference
I.
What translation groups can be compounded from two given
translations ?
It
is clear that the lines of motion of the two
should not be parallel.
For
if, in that case, their amplitudes
were commensurable, we should
fall back upon the preceding
system;
but
if
the amplitudes were incommensurable,
the
group would contain infinitesimal transformations
; and these
we must exclude.
On the other hand, the group compounded
from repetitions of two non-parallel translations will suit our
purpose very well.
If the amplitudes of the two be
I and A,
while m and n are integers, we may write our group in the
form
tf=x + nl,
2/=7/-fmA.
The fundamental regions are parallelograms, each including
two adjacent sides, excepting two
extremities.
The Clifford
surface discussed in Chapters X and XV
offers an excellent
example
of a multiply connected surface of this type.
It
is
interesting
to notice that with
these two examples
we exhaust the possibilities of the euclidean plane.
Suppose,
in
fact,
that P
is any
point of
this
plane, that
is
to
say,
any point in the
finite domain.
The points equivalent
to it
under the congruent group in question may not cluster any-
where, hence there
is one equivalent, or a
finite number of
such, nearer to it than any other.
If these nearest equivalents
do not all lie on a line with P, we may pick out two of them,
non-collinear with P, thus determining one-half of a funda-
mental parallelogram.
If the nearest equivalents are collinear
with P (and, hence, two only in number), we may pick out
one of them and one of the next nearest (which will be
oft*
that
line, unless we are under our previous
first
case), and
thus
construct
a
parallelogram
within
which
there
is
no
equivalent to P, for every point within such a parallelogram
is
nearer
to one
vortex than any two
vertices are
to
one
another.
This parallelogram, including two
adjacent
sides,
except the
vertices which are
not common, will
constitute
a fundamental region, and we are back on the second previous
case.
Let the reader notice an exactly similar line of reasoning
will show that there cannot exist any single valued continuous
function of the complex variable which possesses more than
two independent periods.
In a three-dimensional euclidean space we shall find suitable
groups compounded of one, two, or three independent trans-
lations.
The fundamental regions will be respectively layers

xvn
MULTIPLY CONNECTED SPACES
241
between
parallel
planes,
four-faced
prismatic
spaces,
and
parallelepipeds.
It
is
easy
to determine how much of the
bounding surface should be included in each case.
It is also
evident
that
there
can
be
no
other
groups
composed
of
translations
only, which
fulfil the requirements.
Let us glance for a moment at the various forms of straight
line which will exist in a multiply connected euclidean space
/S',
which corresponds
to a euclidean parallelepiped in
2.
The
corresponding
lines
in 2
shall
all pass through
one vertex
of the fundamental parallelepiped.
If the
line
in 2 be one
edge of the parallelepiped, the line in 8 will be a simple loop
of length equal to one period.
If the
line in 2 connect the
vertex with any other equivalent point, the line in 8 will still
be a loop, but of greater length.
If, lastly, the line in 2 do
not contain any other point equivalent to the vertex, the line
in S will be open, but, if followed
sufficiently far, will pass
again as close as desired to the chosen point.
There
are
other
groups
of motions
of
euclidean
space,
besides
translations which
give
rise
to
multiply
connected
spaces.
An obvious example
is furnished by the repetitions
of a single screw motion.
This may be expressed,
-n being
an
integer, in the form
x' = x cos nO
y sin nd,
y' = x&mnO + yeosnO,
z'= z + nd.
The fundamental regions in 2
will be layers bounded by
parallel planes.
In S we shall have various types of straight
lines.
The Z axis
will be a simple closed loop of length
d.
Will there be any other closed lines in $ 1
The corresponding
lines in 2 must be parallel to the axis, there being an infinite
number of points of each at the same distance from that axis.
When 6 and 2 IT are commensurable, we see that every parallel
to the Z axis will go into a closed lino of the typo required,
when
and
2?r are incommensurable, the Z axis
is the only
closed
line.
Let us now take two points of 2 separated by a distance r
= # -frees a,
f = z -f T cos y.
The necessary and sufficient condition that they should be
equivalent is
x cos n Q __ y s [n n Q _. x + r cos a?
x sin nO + y cos n6 =
?/ + rcos/3,
nd = T cos y.
The
last
of these equations shows that a

pendicular to the Z axis
(i.e.
parallel
to
a
line meeting
it
perpendicularly) cannot return to itself.
On the other hand, if
cos a = cos ft =
;
nO = 2 7/177,
and we have a
closed
loop
of the type just
discussed.
If
a,
/3, y, n be given, r may be determined by the last equation,
and
x, y from
the two preceding,
since
the
determinant
of
the coefficients will not, in general, vanish.
We thus see that
in S the
lines with
direction angles
a,
/3,
y, and
possessing
double points, will form an infinite discontinuous assemblage.
If, on
the other hand,
x, y y
0,
-ti be given, a,
/3, y, r may be
determined from the given equations, coupled with the
fact
that the sum of the squares of the direction cosines is unity
;
through each point in $, not on the Z axis, will pass an infinite
number of straight lines, having this as a double point.
The planes
in & will be of three
sorts.
Those which are
perpendicular to the Z axis will contain open lines only, those
whose equations lack the Z term will contain
till sorts of lines.
Other planes will contain no lines which are simple loops.
Another type
of multiply connected
space will
be
deter-
mined by
x'=~l

The

regions

Lines in 2 parallel to the Z axis will appear in $

This

has,
therefore, the general form of a

When we
turn
from
the
euclidean
to
the
hyperbolic
hypothesis, we find a
less satisfactory state of affairs.
The
real congruent group of the hyperbolic plane was shown in
Chapter VIII
to depend upon the
real binary group
the
homogeneous
coordinates
(t)
being
.supposed
to
define
a
point
of the
absolute
conic.
The two
fixed points must
be
real, in order that the
line joining them
shall be actual,
and its pole, the fixed point, ideal.
In other words, we wish
for
groups
of
binary
linear
substitutions
which
contain
members
of
the
hyperbolic
type
exclusively.
Apparently
such groups have
not,
as
yet, been found.
It might seem,
at
first, that parabolic transformations where the two
fixed
points
of
the
conic
fall
together, would
also
answer,
but
such
is not the
case.
We may show,
in
fact,
that in such
a substitution
there
will
be points
of the plane which
are
transformed by as small a distance as wo please.
The path
curves are horocycles touching the absolute conic at the fixed
point
: having in fact, four-point contact with it.
It is merely
necessary to show that a horocycle of the family may be found
which cuts two
lines through the fixed point in two points
as near together as we please.
Let this fixed point be (0, 0, 1)
while the absolute conic has an equation of the form
xf + x^ = 0.
The general type
for the equation of a horocycle tangent
at

a
limit, as -

P
The group of hyperbolic motions in three dimensions will,
as we saw in Chapter VIII, depend upon the linear function
of the complex variable
a ? -f #
The group which we
require must
not contain rotations
about a line tangent to the Absolute,
for the reason which
we have just seen, hence the complex substitution must not
be parabolic.
Again, we may not have rotations about actual
lines, hence the path curves on the Absolute may not be conies
in planes through an ideal line (the absolute polar of the axis
of rotation)
; the substitutions may not be elliptic.
The only
allowable motions of hyperbolic
space
are
rotations
about
ideal
lines, which
give hyperbolic
substitutions, and
screw
motions, which give loxodromic
ones.
There does not seem
to be any general theory of groups of linear transformations
of
the complex
variable, which
include
merely hyperbolic
and loxodromic members only.*
The group of repetitions of a single rotation about an ideal
line may be put into the form
(IcP =

x '= XQ cosh n
XA sin n 0,
x,^= x sinh
-f- &3 cosh 0.
The fundamental regions
in 2 will
be bounded by pairs
of planes through the
line
a; = x,t = 0.
The orthogonal
trajectories of planes through
this
line will
be equidistant curves whose centres lie thereon.
A line in E
connecting two points which are equivalent under the group
will appear in $ as a lino crossing itself once.

in
like manner, write the group

In
elliptic space we obtain rather more satisfactory results.
Every congruent transformation of the
real elliptic plane
is
a rotation about an actual point, there being no ideal points.
Hence,
there
are
no
two-dimensional
multiply
connected
elliptic spaces.
In three dimensions the case is different.
Let
us assume that k = 1, and consider the group of repetitions
of a
single screw motion.
The angle of rotation about one
axis
is equal to the distance of translation along the other,
and
the two distances or angles
of rotation must be of the
form
>
T in
order that
there
shall
be
no
infinitesimal
v
v
transformations in the group.
Moreover, these two fractions
must have
the same denominator,
for
otherwise
the group
would contain rotations.
We may therefore write the general
equations

where
A,

It will be found that the cosine of the distance of the points
(x), (x'] will be equal to unity only when n is divisible by v,
i.e. we have the identical transformation, so that there are no
real fixed pointy nor points moved an infinitesimal distance.
If A =

a

(cf. Chapter
VIII),
for our
transformation may be written in the quaternion form

The path-curves in 2 will be lines paratactic to either axis

of length -

Notice
the
close
analogy
of
this
case
to
the
simplest case in cuclidean
space.
* Killing, Grundlagen, cit. p. 342, erroneously states that these translations
are the only motions along one fixed line yielding a group
of the desired
type.
The mistake is corrected by Woods, loc.
cit., p. 68.

There
is another translation group of elliptic space giving
rise to a multiply connected space of a simple and interesting
description.
Let
A a
: A 2 be homogeneous parameters, locating
the generators of one set on the Absolute.
Each linear trans-
formation of these will determine a translation.
In particular,
if we put
Jr +/,r1 = \
1
,
x,-ix,^\^
then the translation
(jcj -f a?/ i + a'2'j + s^k) == (a + bi + cj + dk) (XQ + xi 4- xj + #3 &),
may also be written
A
t'=
(
+ hi) A! - (c + di) A2
,
A2
' = (c -
rfi) A! + (a - bi) A, .
Now
this
is precisely the formula
for the rotation
of the
euclidean
sphere.
The
cosine
of
the distance
traversed by
the point
(x)
will
be
which
becomes equal to unity only when
6 = c =
rf = 0, i.e.
when we have the identical transformation.
The groups of
elliptic
translations
which
contain
no
iniinitesimal
trans-
formations,
are
therefore
identical with
those
of
euclidean
rotations about a fixed point which contain no infinitesimal
members, whence
Theorem
3.*
If a
multiply
connected
elliptic
space
be
transformed identically by a group of translations, that group
is
isomorphic with one of the groups of the regular
solids.
Conversely each group
of the regular
solids gives
rise to a
group of right or
left
elliptic translations, suitable to define
a multiply connected space of elliptic type.
Of course the inner reason for
thi.s identity
is that a real
line meets the elliptic Absolute in conjugate imaginary points,
corresponding to diametral imaginary values of the parameter
for
either
set of generators, and a real point of a euclidean
sphere
is given by the value
of its coordinate as a point of
the Gauss sphere, while diametrically opposite points will be
given
by
diametral
values
of the
complex
variable.
The
problem of finding elliptic translations, or euclidean rotations,
depend
therefore, merely on
the
problem
of
finding linear
transformations
of
the
complex
variable
which
transport
diametral
values
into diametral values.

CHAPTER XVIII
THE PROJECTIVE BASIS OF NON-EUCLIDEAN
GEOMETRY
OUR
non-euelidean
system
of
metrics,
as
developed
in
Chapter VII and
subsequently,
rests
in
the
last
analysis,
upon a projective concept, namely, the cross ratio.
The group
of congruent
transformations
appeared
in Chapter
VII
as
a
six-parameter
collineation group, which
left
invariant
a
certain quadric called the Absolute.
An exception must be
made
in the cuclidcan case where the congruent group was
a six-parameter sub-group of the seven-parameter group which
left a conic
in
place.
We thus come naturally
to the idea
that a basis
for our whole edifice may be found in project!ve
geometry, and that non-euclidean metrical geometry may be
built up by positing the Absolute, and defining distance as
in Chapter
VII.
It
is the object of the present chapter to
show
precisely how
this may
be
done,
starting once more
at the very beginning.*
AXIOM
I.
There
exists
a
class
of objects, containing
at
least two distinct members, called points.
AXIOM II. Each pair of distinct points belongs to a single
sub -class called a line.
The
points
shall
also
be said
to be on the
line, the
line
to
pass through the
points.
A
point common to two
lines
shall be called their intersection.
It is evident from Axiom II
that two
lines with two common points are
identical.
We
have thus ruled out the possibility of building up
spherical
geometry upon the present
basis.
AXIOM
III.
Two
distinct
points
determine among
the
remaining points of their line two mutually exclusive sub-
classes, neither of which is empty.
If the given points be A and
.#, two points belonging to

said to be
separated by
them,
two
belonging
to
the
same
class
not
separated*
We
shall
call such
classes separation
classes.
AXIOM IV.
If P and Q be separated by A and
2?, then
Q and P are separated by A and B.
AXIOM V.
If P and Q be
separated by A and
J?, then
A and B are separated by P and
Q.
We shall write this relation PQ fAB or 4B fpQ.
If PQ
J
J
be not separated by A and B, though on a line, or collinear,
with them, we
shall write PQ^AB.
AXIOM VI.
If four distinct collinear points be given there
is a
single way in which they may be
divided
into two
mutually separating pairs.

1. AB fCD and AE

For C and D determine but two separation classes on the
line, and both B and E belong to that class which does not
include A.
Theorem 2.
If five collinear points be given, a chosen pair
of them will either separate two of the pairs formed by the
other three or none
of them.
Let the five points be A, B, C, D, E.
Let AC \DE.

As a result, since BE^AD and AB^ED, we must
have AE\BD.
It will be clear that this theorem includes as a special case
Theorem 3 of Chapter I.
We have but to take A at a great
distance.
Theorem 4
If PA fcD, PB fcD, PQ ^AB, then PQ fC7).
The proof is left to the reader.
It will follow from the fact that neither of our separation
classes
is empty that the assemblage of all
points of a line
is infinite and dense.
We have but to choose one point of
the
line, and say that a point
is between two others when
it be separated thereby from the chosen
point.
AXIOM VII.
If all points of either separation class deter-
mined by two points A, B, be so divided into two sub- classes
that no point
of the
first
is separated from A by B and
a point of the second, there will exist a single point C of
this separation class of such a nature that no point of the
first sub-class
is separated from A by B and
C, and none
of the second
is separated from B by A and
C.
It
is clear that C may be reckoned as belonging
to
either
sub-class,
but
that
no
other
point
enjoys
this
property.
This axiom is one of continuity, let the reader make a careful
comparison with XVIII of Chapter II.
AXIOM VIII.
All points do not belong to one line.
Definition. The assemblage of all points of all lines deter-
mined by a given point and all points of a line not containing
the
first shall be called a plane.
Points or lines in the same
plane shall be called coplaixcr.
AXIOM IX. A
line intersecting in distinct points two of
the
three
lines determined by three non-collinear
points,
intersects the third
line.
Let the reader compare this with the weaker Axiom XVI
of Chapter
I.
Theorem
5. A plane
will
contain completely
every
line
whereof
it contains two
points.
Let the plane be determined by the point A and the line
BG.
If the two given points of the given line belong to BC
or be A and a point of BC, the theorem is immediate.
If not,

let
the
line
contain
the
points
B' and
C'
of AB and AC
respectively.
Let P be any other
point of the given
line.
Then BP will intersect AC, hence AP will intersect BC or
will
lie in the given
plane.
Theorem
6.
If A, By C be three non-collinear
points, then
the planes determined by A and
J?(7, by B and CA, and by
C and AB are
identical.
We have but to notice that the lines generating each plane
lie wholly in each of the others.
Theorem 7.
If A'',
,6', C' be three non-collinear points of the
plane
determined by ABC, then
the planes determined by
A'E'C' and ABC are
identical.
This will come immediately from the two preceding.
Theorem 8. Two lines in the same plane always intersect.
Let B and C be two points of the one line, and A a point
of the other,
If A be also a point of BG the theorem is proved.
If not, we may use the point A and the line BC to determine
the plane, and our second line must be identical with a line
through A meeting EC.
AXIOM X. All points do not lie in one plane.
Definition. The assemblage of all points of all lines which
arc determined by a chosen point, and
all points of a plane
not containing the first point shall be called a space.
We
leave
to
the
reader
the proofs of the following very
simple theorems.
Theorem 9. A space contains completely every line whereof
it contains two points.
Theorem
10. A
space
contains
completely
every
plane
whereof
it contains three non-collinear points.
Theorem 11. The space determined by a point A and the
plane BCD
is identical with that determined by B and the
plane CDA.
Theorem 12.
If A', B',
C', D' be four non-coplanar points of
the space determined by A, B, C, D, then the two spaces deter-
mined by the two sets of four points are identical.
With regard to the last theorem it is clear that all points of
the space determined by A', B\ 0', D
f lie in that determined by
A, B, (7, D.
Let us assume that $', C', D' are points of AB, AC,
AD respectively.
The planes BCD and B'C/D' have a common

line
I, which naturally belongs to both
spaces.
Let us
first
assume that AA' does not intersect this line.
Let A" be the
intersection of AA' with BCD.
Then A"R meets both A
f E
r
and
Z, hence, has two points in each space,
or
lies in
each.
Then the plane BCD lies in both spaces, as do the line A'A"
and the point A
;
the two spaces are
identical.
If, on
the
other hand, AA' meet
I in A" , then A
lies in both
spaces.
Furthermore A
fB will meet A"B' in a point of both spaces,
so that B will
lie in both, and, by similar reasoning, C and D
lie in both.
Theorem 13. Two planes in the same space have a common
line.
Theorem 14. Three planes in the same space have a common
line or a common point.
Practical limitation.
All
points,
lines, and planes herein-
after considered are supposed to belong to one space.
Theorem-
15.
If three
lines A A', BB\ 0(7 be
concurrent,
then the intersections of AB and A'B', of SO and B'G', of CA
and C' A' are collinear, and conversely.
This is Desargues' theorem of two triangles.
The following
is the usual proof.
To begin with,
let us suppose that the
planes ABC and A'B'C'
are
distinct.
The
lines AA', BB\
and CC' will be concurrent in
outside of both planes.
Then
as AB and A'B' arc coplanar, they intersect in a point which
must
lie
011 the line
I of intersection of the two planes ABO
and A'B'C' , and a similar remark applies to the intersections
of BC and B'G\
of CA and G'A' .
Conversely, when these
last-named three
pairs
of
lines
intersect,
the
intersections
must be on L
Considering the lines AA', BB'', and CO', we
see
that each two are coplanar, and must intersect, but
all
three
are
not
coplanar.
Hence
the
three
are
concurrent.
The second case occurs where A
fB'C
f are three non-col linear
points
of the plane determined by ABC.
Let V and V be
two points without this plane collinear with
the point of
concurrence of AA
f
, BB, CO'.
Then VA will meet VA' in
A", VB will meet V ff in JT, and VC will meet V'V in C".
The planes ABC and A"R"G"
will meet
in
a
line
I, and
J3"<7" will meet both BO and B
fC/
in a point of
/.
In the
same way CA
will meet G'A' on
I, and AB will meet A'J3'
on L
Conversely, if the last-named three pairs of lines meet
in
points
of a line
I
in their plane, we may find A"Bf'C"
non-collinear points in another plane through
I, so that R"C'
r
meets BC and B'G' in a point of
I, and similarly
for C"A",

f and
for A"B" , AB, A'B'.
Then by the converse
of the
first
part
of our
theorem AA"\ BB", CC"
will
be
concurrent
in F, and A'A" 9
B'B", C'C"
concurrent
in V.
Lastly, the three coaxal planes VV'A", VV'B", VV'C" will
meet the plane ABC in three concurrent lines A A', BB', CO'.
We have already remarked in Chapter VI on the dependence
of this theorem for the plane either on the assumption of the
existence of a third dimension, or of a congruent group.
Definition.
If four coplanar points, no three of which are
collinear, be given, the figure formed by the three pairs of
lines determined by them
is
called a
complete quadrangle.
The original points are called the vertices, the pairs of lines
the
sides.
Two sides which do not contain a common vertex
shall
be
said
to be
opposite.
The
intersections of pairs
of
opposite
sides
shall be
called diagonal points.
Theorem 16.
If two complete
quadrangles
be
so
situated
that five sides of one meet
five
sides of the other
in points
of a line, the sixth side of the first meets the sixth side of the
second in a point of that line.
The figure formed by four coplanar lines, no three of which
are
concurrent,
shall
be
called
a
complete
quadrilateral.
Their six intersections shall be called the vertices
; two vertices
being said to be opposite when they are not on the same side.
The three lines which connect opposite pairs of vertices shall
be called diagonals.
Definition.
If A and C be two opposite vertices of a com-
plete
quadrilateral, while the diagonal which connects them
meets the other two in B and 7), then A and E shall be said
to be harmonically separated by C and
/).
Theorem 17.
If A
and C
be harmonically
separated
by
B and D, then B and D are harmonically separated by A
and
C.
The proof will come immediately from
15,
after drawing
two or three
lines; we leave the
details to the reader.
Definition.
If A
and C
be
harmonically
separated
by
B and D, each
is said to be the harmonic conjugate of the
other with regard to these two points
;
the four points may
also be said to form a harmonic
set.
Theorem 18. A given point has a unique harmonic conjugate
with regard to any two points collinear with
it.
This is an immediate result of 16.

A, B,
C', D not collincar with it by lines OA, OB, 0(7, OD, and
if these lines meet another line in A\ B
f
, C", D' respectively,
and, lastly, if A and C be harmonic conjugates with regard
to B and
J5, then A' and C' are harmonic conjugates with
regard to B
f and
D'.
We may
legitimately assume
that the
quadrilateral
con-
struction which yielded A, B,
(7, D was in a plane which did
not contain 0,
for
this construction may be
effected in any
plane which contains AD.
Then radiating lines through
will
transfer
this
quadrilateral
construction
into
another
giving A', B\ C', D'.
Definition.
If a, 6,
c, d be four concurrent lines which pass
through A

separated by B and

c may properly be said
to

d, and
6
and d
harmonically separated by a and
c.
We may also speak of
a and
c as harmonic conjugates with regard
to
6 and d, or
say that the four
lines form a harmonic
set.

if A and C be harmonically

by B and D, then A
f and
C'

It is sufficient to draw the line AD

Definition.
If four coaxal planes a,
/3, y, 6 pass respectively
through four points A, B> C, D where A and C are harmonically
separated by B and

then we may speak of a and y as
harmonically separated by ft and 8, or
/3 and 5 as harmonically
separated by a and
y.
We
shall also say that
a and y are
harmonic conjugates with regard to
ft and
<5, or that the four
planes form a harmonic set.
We
shall
understand
by
projection
the
transformation
(recently used) whereby coplanar points and lines are carried,
by means of concurrent
lines, into other coplanar points and
lines.
With this in mind, we have the theorem.

of projections and

sections will carry a harmonic set into a harmonic set.

A
complete justification
for
this terminology will be found
in Axiom XI and in the two theorems which now follow.
Theorem 22. The laws of separation
laid down
for points
in Axioms III-VII hold equally for coplaiiar concurrent lines,
and coaxal planes.
We have merely to bring the four lines or planes to intersect
another line in distinct points, and apply XI.
Theorem 23. The relation of separation is unaltered by any
finite number of projections and intersections.
Theorem 24.
If J., B, C, D be four collinear points, and A

We have

that

Hence our theorem.
Before proceeding further, let us glance for a moment at the
question of the independence of our axioms.
The author
is not familiar with any system of projective
geometry where XI
is lacking.
X naturally
fails
in plane
geometry.
Here IX must be suitably modified, and Desargues'
theorem, our 15, must be assumed as an axiom.
IX is lack-
ing
in
the
projective
euclidean
geometry
where
the
ideal
plane
is excluded.
VIII fails in the geometry of the single
line,
while VII
is untrue
in the system of all points with
rational Cartesian coordinates.
Ill, IV, V, VI may be shown
to be serially independent.*
II
is lacking
in the geometry
of four points,
Besides being independent, our axioms possess the far more
important
characteristic of being
consistent.

ratio.

A similar proof may be found
for the case where negative subscripts are involved.

Let us divide all points of the separation class determined
by 7^7^ which include P1 and P the positive separation class
let us say, into two sub-classes as follows.
A point A shall
be assigned to the
first class
if we may find such a positive

otherwise
it
shall be assigned
to the second
class,
i.e.
for every point of the second
class
and every positive integral value of
7?., ^7? \Pn+ iP^^
Then,
by
3,
as
long
as A
and B
are
distinct we
shall
have
PQ B\AP^
y giving
a
dichotomy
of
the
sort
demanded
by
Axiom VII, and a point of division D.
Let us further assume
that OD meets ^ in T)y and VD meets
l
{} in
(7.
We know that
Hence
lines
from
P
{}
to V and D
are
not
i
separated by those to
and P^
.
Hence lines from
7) to
7^
and
V,
are
not
separated by those
to
and
J^,
so
that
or G
is a point of the
first
sub-class.
We may,
then, find n
so great that PQ PU \C2^
,. hence Q^^ADP^
and P^+JW;.
But PQ P^DP^
; hence PQPn+lJDPw
.
This,
however,
is absurd,
for a point separated from
]^ by D and
l
j
n+1 would have
to belong
to
both
classes.
Our
theorem
results from
this contradiction.
We might treat the case where P P P^P^ in exactly the
same way.
Our net result
is that if P be any point of the
line lQt it is either a point of the system we have constructed,

xvin
NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY
257
or else we may find two such successive integers (calling
an
integer) n, n + 1 that Pn Pn+l
PP^
.
Our next care shall be to find points of the line to which we
may properly assign fractional subscripts.
Let lk be the line
from P^
to
the
intersection of OPk with VP .
Then
I say
that VPm and OPm+k meet on lk
.
This is certainly true when
k =
1.
Let us assume
it
to be true in the
case of
lk^ 9
so
that VP^ and OPk meet on
lk _v
Then
lk is constructed with
regard to
lk_ l as was l
with regard to Z
, for we take a point
of
lk_u connect
it with
and find where
that
line meets
V!Q.
In
like manner VP2 meets OPk+l on
lk^ and
OJF^. +2
on
lk and so on; VPm meets OPm+k on
lk , which was to be
proved.
As an
application
of this we observe
that
ln
meets VPn
on the
line OP% n , hence we
easily
see
that Pn and
P^
are
harmonically
separated by
T^J and
P% n
.
Secondly, find
the
points into which the points P^,Pk ,Pl are projected from
on
the line VPm
.
These points
lie on the lines I^m9 ^-m> h-m*
Find the intersections of the latter with VPn and project back
from
on
; we
get the
points Pn+h _m , Pn+k . m , Pn+ i-m
.
A particular result of thia will be that Pk Pk+n Pk+2n^>
f rm
a harmonic
set.
Let us now draw a line from JJ to the intersection of VPQ
and
ln , and let this meet P^ V in Vt
.
Then if 7J , Pk , P
t
, Pa be
n
projected from
upon TjjV and then projected back from V\
upon Z
, we get points which we may call JP,P^,Pj, Jf^, where
Pn
P^
Connect P^ with the intersection of VPQ and OPl by

a line
lr
We may use this
line to find Pk
as formerly we
'71
ti
used ^ to find Pk
.
We shall thus find
that
P^ and P2n are
harmonically
separated
by Pn and
7^,
or
P^ n
is
identical
w.
IT
with ^, and similarly
Jfjlw
is identical with 7^.
Subdividing
IT
still further we
shall
find that Pr is identical with Pl or 7Jm
rn
n
~r7t
identical with
7^.
We have
thus
found
a
single
definite
n
point
to
correspond
to
each
positive
rational
subscript.
Negative
rational
subscripts might be treated in
the same
way, and eventually we shall find a single point whose sub-

script
is any chosen rational number.
We
shall
also
find,
by reducing to a common denominator, that
if
^ Poo>
with a similar rule for negative numbers.
It remains to take up the irrational
case.
Let P be any
point of the positive separation class determined by P^ and P^
.
Then either
it
is a point with a rational subscript, according
to our scheme, or
else, however great soever n may
be, we
may
find m
so
that J^P f^Z., P,Pm^{PP^.
We
thus
I

have a dichotomy
of
the
positive
rational number
system
of
such
a
nature
that
a number
of the
lower
class
will
correspond
to a point separated from P^ by P
{] and P while
one of the upper
class
will
correspond to a point separated
from PQ by P and P^.
There
will be no largest number in
the lower
class.
We know, in
fact,
that wherever R may
be in the positive
separation
class
of P^P^ we may
find
/*/
r
so great
that PQIn,\RP^.
We may express
this by saying
that Pn,
approaches
P^
as
a
limit
as
n'
increases.
Hence,
as separation is invariant under projection, ln, approaches QO
as a limit and PL approaches P
as a limit, or Pm
j approaches
w
n + w/
Pnti as a limit.
We can thus find
?&' so large that Ptn
l is also
n

a number of the
first class, and surely
- H
7 >
In the
7i
ll>
'tb
same way we show
that
there can be no smallest number
in
the upper
class.
Finally
each number of
the
upper
is
greater than each of the lower.
Hence a perfect dichotomy
is effected in the system of positive rationals defining a precise
irrational number, and
this may be assigned as a subscript
to P.
A similar proceeding will assign a definite subscript to
each point of the other negative separation class of I^P^.
Conversely, suppose that we have given a positive irrational
number.
This will be given by a dichotomy in the system of
positive rationals, and corresponding thereto we may establish
<a
classification among the
points
of the positive separation
class
of P P^
according
to
the
requirement
of Axiom VII.
We
shall, in
fact,
assign a point A
of this separation
class
to the lower sub-class
if we may find such a number in the
lower number
class
that the point with
the
corresponding

xvin
NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY
259
subscript is separated from PQ by P^ and A
;
otherwise a point
shall be assigned to the upper Hub-class.
If thus A and B
be any two points of the lower and upper sub-classes respec-
tively, we can
find
in
the lower number
class
so
that
P Pm \AP^
whereas P B fPw P^

J
n
J
This shows
that
all
of the requirements
of Axiom VII are
fulfilled, we may assign
as
subscript
to the resulting point
of division the irrational in question.
In the same way we
may assign a
definite point to any negative irrational.
The
one to one correspondence between points of a line and the real
number system including oo is thus complete.
Definition.
If A, 5, G, D be four collinear points, whereof
the
first three
are
necessarily
distinct, the
subscript which
should be attached
to
D, when A,
B, G are made to play
respectively the roles of P^
, P
, Pl in the preceding discussion,
shall be
called
a
cross
ratio
of the four given points, and
indicated by the symbol (AB, CD).
Four points which are
distinct would thus seem to have twenty-four different
cross
ratios, as a matter of fact they have but six.
We know that the harmonic relation
is unaltered by any
finite number of projections and intersections. We may there-
fore define the cross ratios of four concurrent coplanar lines,
or four
coaxal
planes, by the
corresponding
cross
ratios
of
the points where they meet any other
line.
Theorem
27.
Cross
ratios
are
unaltered
by
any
finite
number of projections and intersections.
Definition.
The
range
of
all
collinear
points,
the
pencil
of
all

the
pencil
of

Definition. Two fundamental one-dimensional forms
shall
be said to \>e protective if they may be put into such a one to one
correspondence that corresponding cross ratios are equal.
Theorem
28.
If in two
project!ve
one-dimensional
forms
three elements of one
lie
in
the
corresponding elements of
the
other, then every element of the
first
lies in the
corre-
sponding element of the second.
For we may use these three elements in each case as GO, 0, 1,
and then, remembering the definition of cross ratio, make use
of the
fact that the construction of the harmonic conjugate

THE PROJECTIVE BASIS OF

of a point with regard to two others is unique.
This theorem
is known as the fundamental one of projective geometry.*
Theorem 29.
If two fundamental one-dimensional forms be
connected by a finite number of projections and intersections
they are projective.
This comes immediately from 27.
Theorem 30.
If two fundamental one-dimensional forms be
projective, they may
be
connected
by
a
finite number
of
projections and
intersections.
It is, in fact, easy to connect them with two other projective
forms whereof one contains three, and hence all corresponding
members of the other.
Let us now turn back for a moment to our cross ratio scale.
We have already seen that in the case of integers, and, hence,
by reducing
to
least common
denominator,
in
the
case
of
all
rational numbers

I, m, n.
By letting k,
I, m, n become irrational, one at a time, and
applying
a
limiting
process, we
see
that
this equation
is
always
true.
In like manner we see that P , Pq

set, as do Pu , Pq + k , ^ q + /. , P^

the line from

hence, when it takes any real value.

If three

homogeneous coordinates whose ratio

To demonstrate this we have merely to point out that surely
this transformation

dispose of our arbitrary constants as to carry any three distinct
points into any other three, the maximum amount of freedom
for
any
protective
transformation
of
a
fundamental
one-
dimensional
form.
Let
the reader show
that the necessary
and
sufficient
condition that there
should be two
real
self-
corresponding points which separate each pair of corresponding
points is
! a;
_
, <
Two
projective
sets on the same fundamental one-dimen-
sional form whose elements correspond interchangeably, are
said
to
form
an
involution.
By
this
is meant
that
each
element
of
the
form
has
the
same
corresponding element
whether
it
be
assigned
to
the
first
or
to the
second
set.
It will be found
that the necessary and
sufficient condition
for an involution in the case of equation (3) will be
When
the determinant
| a^
\ > 0,
there
will
be no
self-
corresponding points, and the involution is said to be elliptic.
Let the reader show that under these circumstances each pair
of the involution separates each other pair.
Our
next task
shall
be
to
set
up
a
suitable
coordinate
system for the plane and for space.
Let us take in the plane
four points A, B, C\ D, no three being
collinear.
We
shall
assign to these respectively the coordinates
(1, 0, 0),
(0, 1, 0),
(0, 0,
1),
(1,
1,
1).
Let AD meet BG in A^ BD meet GA
in .Sp and CD meet AB in Cr
The intersections of AB, A l
l ,
of BC, 5j6\, and of CA, OlA ly are, by 15, on a line d.
Now
let P be any other point in the plane
(ABAC, ADAP) = (P(\PC, PDPA) = (PCPC,, PAPD)
(BCBA, BDBP) = (PCPCv PDPB)
(CACB, CDCP) = (POlP0 9 PAPB) =
From this
it
is clear that the product of the three is equal
to unity, and we may represent them by three numbers of the

One

will vanish for a point lying on one of the lines AB, SO, CA.
Let
the
reader
convince
himself
that
the
usual
cartesian
system
is but a special cane of this homogeneous coordinate
system where two of the four given points are ideal, and

If (y) and
(z) be two points, not collinear with A, B y or G,
while P
is a variable point with coordinates \(y)-f /x(0), the
lines connecting
it with A

will meet BG and (CA)
respectively
in the points

(A?/ + ^0

It is easy to HOC that the expressions for corresponding cross
ratios in these two ranges are identical, hence the ranges are
projective.
The
pencils which they determine at A and B
are therefore projective, and have the line AB self-correspond-
ing, for this will correspond to the parameter value
\:/* = V-2fe-
But
it will follow immediately from 28, that if two pencils
be coplanar and
projective, with
a
self-corresponding
line,
the locus of the intersection of their corresponding members
is
also a
line.
Hence
the
locus
of the point P with
the
coordinates
A(y) + ^(s)
is
the
line
connecting
(y) and
(z).
Conversely,
it
is evident that every point
of the
line from
(y)
to
(z)
will have coordinates
linearly dependent on those
of (y) and (z).
If, then, we put
and eliminate X
: p, we have as equation of the line
| xyz
| = (ux) = 0.
Conversely, it is evident that such an equation will always
represent a
line, except, of course, in the
trivial case where
the u's are all zero.
Let the reader show that the coefficients

264
THE PROJECTIVE BASIS OF

have
a
geometrical
interpretation
dual
to
that
of
the
coordinates ^ ;
for this purpose the line which we have above
called d will be found useful.
Our system of homogeneous coordinates may be extended
with great ease to
space.
Suppose that we have given
five
points A,
J3,
(7, D,
no four being coplanar.
Let P be any
other point in space.
We may write
(ABCABD, ABOABP) = ^

(ACDACB, ACOACP) = ^,
(ADBADC, ADOADP) = --2 .

We shall then be able to write also
(CDA CDS, CDO CDP) = X *

(DBA DEC, DBO DBF) = ^

XQ
XQ
(BCD BOA, SCO BCP) = X*
In other words, we may give to a point four homogeneous
coordinates x
:xl :xz :xz
.
Two
points
collinear with A, B,
C, or D will differ (or may be made to differ) in one coordinate
only.
An equation of the
first
degree
in three coordinates
will
represent
a
plane
through
one
of
these
four
points.
Every line will be the intersection of two such planes, and
will be represented by the combination of two linear equations
one
of which lacks
x.i while the other lacks x>.
The coor-
dinates of all points of a line may therefore be expressed as
a
linear combination
of the
coordinates of any two points
thereof.
A plane may
be represented
as
the assemblage of
all points whose coordinates are linearly dependent on those
of three non-collinear points.
Eliminating the variable para-
meters from the four equations for the coordinates of a point
in a plane, we
see
that a plane may
also
be given by an
equation of the type
/

Conversely, the assemblage of all points whose coordinates
satisfy an equation such as
(5) will be of such a nature that
it
will contain
all points of a line whereof it contains two
distinct
points, yet
will meet a chosen
line, not in
it, but
once.
Let the
reader show that such an assemblage must
be a plane.
The homogeneous parameters (u) which, naturally,
may not
all vanish together, may be called the coordinates

plane.
They
will have
a
significance

to
that
of the coordinates of a point.*
If we have four collinear points

one cross ratio will be
A//
The
proof
will
consist
in
finding
the points where
four
coaxal planes through these four points meet the line
and then applying (2).
Suppose that we have a transformation of the type
0..3
3
This
shall
be
called
a
collineation.
We
shall
restrict
ourselves to those
collineations for which
The
transformation
is,
clearly,
one
to
one, with no
ex-
ceptional points.
It will carry a plane into a plane, a line
into a line, a complete quadrilateral into a complete quadri-
lateral, and
a
harmonic
set
into a harmonic
set.
It
will
therefore leave cross ratios invariant.
Moreover, every point
to
point
and
plane
to
plane
transformation
will
be
a
collineation.
For every such
transformation
will enjoy
all
of the properties which we have mentioned with regard to
a
collineation, and will, therefore, be completely determined
when once we know the fate of five points, no four of which
are coplanar.
But we easily see that we may dispose of the
arbitrary constants in (6), to carry any such five points into
any other
five.
It
is worth while to pause for a moment at this point in
order to
see what geometrical meaning may be attached to
coordinate sets which have imaginary values.
This question
* The treatment of cross ratios in the present chapter is based on that of
Pasch, loc. cit.
The development of the coordinate system is also taken from
the same source, though it has been possible to introduce notable simplifica-
tion, especially in three dimensions.

THE PROJECTIVE BASIS OF

has
already been
discussed
in Chapter
VII.
Every
set
of
complex coordinates
/
\
^/z \
may be taken to define the elliptic involution
0.
(7)
To verify this statement we have merely to notice that an
involution
will, by
definition, be carried into an involution
by any number of
projections and
intersections, and
that
equations such as (7) will go into other such equations.
But
in the case of the line
__
,
__ n
M/O

*')
these
equations
will
give
an
involution,
for
the
relation
between (x) and
(#') may readily be reduced to the type of (3)
and
(4).
Did we seek the analytic expression for the coor-
dinates
of a
self-corresponding point
in
(7) we
should
get
the values
(y) + i(s)-
Conversely,
it is
eas}^ to show that any elliptic involution
may be reduced to the type of (7).
There is, therefore, a one
to one correspondence between the assemblage of all
elliptic
point involutions, and all sets of pairs of conjugate imaginary
coordinate values.
The
correspondence between
coordinate
sets and
elliptic
involutions may be made more precise in the following fashion.
Two
triads of collinear points ABC, A'R'G' shall be
said to
have the same sense when the projective transformation which
carries the one set, taken in order, into the other, has a positive
determinant
; when the determinant
is negative they shall be
said to have opposite senses.
In this latter case alone, as we
have already seen,
will
there
be two real self-corresponding
points which
separate
each
distinct
pair
of
corresponding
points.
Two
triads which have
like
or
opposite
senses
to
a third, have like senses to one
another,
for the determinant
of the product of two projective transformations of the line
into itself is the product of the determinants.
We
shall also
find that the triads ABC, BGA^ GAB have like senses, while
each
has
the
sense opposite
to
that of either
of the triads
ACB) GBA) BAG.
We may thus say that three points given
in order will determine a sense of description for the whole
range
of points on the
line, in that the cyclic order of any
other three points which are to have the same sense as the
first
three
is
completely
determined.
It
is
immediately
evident
that
any
triad
of
points
and
their
mates
in
an
elliptic involution have the same sense.
We may
therefore

xviii
NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY
267
attach
to such an
elliptic involution either the one
or
the
other sense of description for the whole range of points.
Definition. An
elliptic
involution
of points
to which
is
attached a particular sense of description of the line on which
they are
situated

The same involution considered in connexion with the other
sense shall be called the conjugate imaginary point.
Starting with
this, we may define an imaginary plane as
an
elliptic involution in an axial pencil, in connexion with
a sense of description
for the pencil; when the other sense
is taken in connexion with this involution we shall say that
we have the conjugate imaginary plane.
An imaginary point
shall be said to be in an imaginary plane
if the pairs of the
involution which determine the point
lie in pairs of planes
of the involution determining the plane, and
if the sense of
description of the
line associated with the point engenders
among
the planes the same sense as
is associated with the
imaginary
plane.
Analytically
let
us
assume
that
besides
the involution of points given by (7) we have the following
involution of planes.
(u) =
I (v) + m (w),
(u)
V (v) + m' (w),
IV 4- mm'= 0,
(vy) =- (wz) = 0.
(8)
The plane
(u)
will contain the point
I (vz) (y)
m (ivy) (2)
while its mate in the involution contains the point
These points will be mates in the point involution,
if
and these equations tell us that the imaginary plane (v) -f i (w)
will contain either the point (y) + i (z), or the point (y)
i(z).
An imaginary line may be defined as the assemblage of
all
points common to two imaginary planes.
Imaginary points,
lines, and planes obey
the same laws
of
connexion
as
do
real ones.
A geometric proof may be found based upon the
definitions given, but it is immediately evident analytically.*

minant of the two linear homogeneous equations in #

The assemblage of all points whose coordinates
satisfy an
equation of the type
shall be called a quadrie.
We should find no
difficulty in
proving all of the well-known theorems of a descriptive sort
connected with quadrics in terms of our present coordinates.
We have now, at length, reached the point where we may
profitably introduce metrical concepts.
Let us recall that the
group of congruent transformations which we considered in
Chapter II, and, more
fully,
in Chapter VIII,
is a group of
collineations which
leaves
invariant
either
a quadric
or
a
conic, and depends upon
six
parameters.
We
also saw
in
Chapter
II, that the congruent group may be characterized
as follows
(cf.
p. 38)
:
(a) Any real point of a certain domain may be carried into
any other such point.
(b) Any chosen
real point may be
left invariant, and any
chosen real line through it carried into any other such line.
(c) Any real point and line through it may be left invariant,
and any real plane through this line may be carried into any
other such plane.
(d)
If a real point, a line through
it, and a plane through
the
line
be
invariant,
no
further
infinitesimal
congruent
transformations are
possible.
It shall be our present task to show that these assumptions,
or rather the
last three, joined to the ones already made in
the present chapter, will
serve
to
define hyperbolic
elliptic
and euclidean geometry.
It is assumed that there exists an assemblage of transforma-
tions, called congruent transformations, obeying the following
laws:
AXIOM XII. The assemblage of all congruent transforma-
tions
is a group of collineations, including the inverse of
each member.*
*
It is highly remarkable that this axiom
is superfluous.
Cf. Lie-Engcl,
Theorie der Transformationsgrupptn, Leipzig, 1888-93, vol.
iii, Ch. XXII,
98.
The assumption that our congruent transformations are collineations, does,
however, save an incredible amount of labour, and,
lor that reason,
is in-
cluded here.

AXIOM XIII. The group of congruent transformations may
be
expressed by means
of analytic
relations among
the
parameters of the general collineation group.
Definition.
The assemblage
of
all
real points whose
co-
ordinates
satisfy three inequalities of the type
& < "' < X{ ,
i = I, 2, 3,
^0
shall be called a restricted region.
AXIOM XIV. A congruent transformation may be found
leaving
invariant
any point
of
a
restricted
region,
and
transforming any real line through that point into any other
such line.
AXIOM XV. A congruent
transformation may be found
leaving invariant any point of a restricted region, and any
real line through that
point;
yet carrying any real plane
through that line into any other such plane.
AXIOM XVI.
There
exists no continuous assemblage of
congruent transformations which leave invariant a point of
a restricted region, a real line through that point, and a real
plane through that line.
Theorem 33. The congruent group
is transitive for a suffi-
ciently small restricted region.
This comes
at once by reductio ad absurdum.
For
the
tangents
to
all
possible paths which a chosen point might
follow would,
if 33 were
untrue, generate a surface
or
set
of surfaces, or a line or
set of lines, and this assemblage of
surfaces
or
lines would be carried into
itself by every con-
gruent transformation which
left this point invariant.
The
tangent planes to the surfaces, or the lines in question, could
not, then,
be freely interchanged with other planes
or
lines
through the point.
Theorem 34. The congruent group depends on six essential
parameters.
The number
of parameters
is
certainly
finite
since
the
congruent group
arises
from
analytic
relations among
the
fifteen essential parameters of the general collineation group.
Tho
transference
from
a
point
to
a
point
imposes
three
restrictions, necessarily
distinct, as
three independent para-
meters are needed to determine a point.
A fixed point being
chosen, two more
independent
restrictions
are imposed by

270
THE PROJECTIVE BASIS OF

determining
the
fate
of any chosen
real
line
through
it.
When
a
point
and
line
through
it
are
chosen, one more
restriction
is imposed by determining what
shall become of
any assigned plane through the line.
When, however, a real
plane, a real
line
therein, and a real point in the
line
are
fixed, there can be no independent parameter remaining, as no
further infinitesimal transformations are
possible.
Let us now look more closely at the one-parameter family
of
project!ve
transformations
of
the
axial
pencil
through
a fixed
line of the chosen
restricted region.*
Let us
deter-
mine
any
plane
through
this
line
by two
homogeneous
parameters
A1 :A 2 , and
take an
infinitesimal
transformation
of the group
The product of two such infinitesimal transformations will
belong to our group, hence also, as none but analytic functions
are involved, the limit of the product of an
infinite number
of such transformations as dt approaches zero
; that
is to say,
the
transformation
obtained by
integrating
this
equation
belongs
to
the
group.
Now
this
integral will involve one
arbitrary constant, which may be used to make the transfor-
mation
transitive, and
for
all
transformations
obtained by
this integration, that pair of planes will be invariant which
was
invariant
for
the
infinitesimal
transformation.
Our
one-parameter group has thus a transitive one-parameter sub-
group with a single pair of planes
invariant.
These planes
are
surely
conjugate
imaginary,
for
otherwise
there would
be infinitesimal congruent transformations which left a point,
line, and
real plane invariant;
contrary
to our
last axiom.
The question
of whether our whole one-parameter group
is
generated by this integration or not, need not detain us here.
What is essential is that this pair of planes will be invariant
for the whole group.
For suppose that S^ indicate a generic
transformation of the sub-group which leaves invariant the
two planes
a,
a', and the transformation T carries the two
planes a, a' into two planes
/3,
j3'.
Then
all transformations
of the type
TS-T~^
will belong to our group, and leave the planes
/3,
/3' invariant,
and combining
these
with
the
transformations
$^ we have
a two-parameter sub-group of our one-parameter group
; an
absurd result.

NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY

Let us next consider the three-parameter congruent group
composed
of
all transformations which have a fixed
point.
If a real line
I bo carried into a real
line
l\ then the two
planes which were invariant with
I will go into those which
are invariant with
V.
To prove this we have but to repeat
the reasoning which lately showed that the two planes which
were invariant
for a
sub-group, are
invariant
for the
total
one-parameter group.
The
envelope
of
all
these
invariant
planes which pass through a point
will thus depend upon
one
parameter,
for
if
it depended on two
it would include
real planes, and
this
is not the case.
It is well known that
this system of planes must envelope lines or a quadric cone.*
The
first case
is
surely excluded
for such lines would have
to appear
in conjugate imaginary
pairs,
giving
rise
to
in-
variant real planes through this point, and there are no such
in
the
three-parameter
group.
The
envelope
is
therefore
a cone with no real tangent planes.
Each pair of conjugate
imaginary tangent planes must touch
it along two conjugate
imaginary
lines
;
the
plane
connecting
these
is
real, and
invariant
for the one-parameter congruent group associated
with
the
line
of intersection
of the two imaginary
planes.
Let us
fix our attention upon one such one-parameter group
and
choose our
coordinate
system
in such a way that the
non-homogeneous coordinates u, v, 1 of our three fixed planes
are proportional respectively to
(0,
0,
1),
(1,
i,
0),
(1,
-i,
0).
The
general
linear
transformation
keeping
these
three
invariant
is
yf = r cos Ou
r sin Ov,
v' = r sin Ou + r cos Ov.
Here r must be a constant, as otherwise we should have
congruent transformations of the type
u'= ru,
v
f'= TV,
which kept a point, a
line, and
all planes through that line
invariant, yet depended on an arbitrary parameter.
In order
to see what sort of cones are carried into themselves by this
group, the cone we are seeking for being necessarily of the
number,
let us take an infinitesimal transformation
Au =
vdO,
Ai? = udO.
Integrating
u* + v2 ^C.
The cone we seek is therefore a quadric cone.
*

272
THE PROJECTIVE BASIS OF
CH.
We see by a repetition of the sort of reasoning given above
that
if we
take
a
congruent
transformation
that
carries
a point P into a point P', it will carry the invariant quadric
cone whose vertex
is P into that whose vertex
is P
.
The
envelope of these quadric cones
is, thus, invariant under the
whole congruent group.
The envelope of these cones must
be a quadric
or conic.
This theorem
is simpler when put
into the dual form,
i.e. a surface which meets
every plane
in a conic
is a quadric or quadric cone.
For
it has just the
same points in every plane as the quadric or cone through
two of its conies and one other of its points.
In our present
case our quadric must have a real equation, since
it touches
the conjugate to each imaginary plane tangent thereto.
There
are, hence, three possibilities
:
(a) The quadric is real, but the restricted region in question
is within it.
(6) The quadric is imaginary.
(c) The quadric is an imaginary conic in a real plane.
Theorem 35. The congruent group is a six-parameter colli-
neation group which leaves invariant a quadric or a conic.
It remains for us to find the expression for distance.
We
make the following assumptions.
AXIOM XVII. The distance of two points of a restricted
region
is
a
real
value
of
an
analytic
function
of
their
coordinates.
AXIOM XVIII.
If ABC be three collinear real points, and
if B be separated by A and G from a point of their line not
belonging to this restricted region ; then the distance from
A
to O
is
the sum of the distance from A
to B and the
distance from B to
G.
Let the reader show that this definition is legitimate as all
points separated from A by B and
(7, or from
by A and B
will belong to the restricted region.
Let us
first take cases
(a) and
(6) together.
The distance
must be a continuous function of each cross ratio determined by
the two points and the
intersections of
their
line with the
quadric.
If we call a distance d, and the corresponding cross
ratio of this type
c, we must have
e=f(d).
Moreover, from equation (1) and Axiom XIII,

xvin
NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY
273
Now this functional equation
is well known, and the only
continuous solution is *
d
c = e^.
d
1
.
If,
in
particular,
the two points be J^P2 while
their line
meets the quadric in Q^ 2 , we
shall have
for our
distance,
equation
(5)
of Chapter VII
From
this we may
easily work back
to
the familiar ex-
pressions for the cosine of the fcth part of the distance.
The
case
of
an
invariant
conic
is
handled
somewhat
differently.
Let the equations of the invariant conic be
# = 0,
or^ + x^ + x^ = 0.
These are unaltered by a seven-parameter group
where
|| axl a2
.2 a:i3
1|
is
the
matrix
of a
ternary
orthogonal
substitution.
For our
congruent group we must
have the
six-parameter sub-group where the determinant of this ortho-
gonal substitution has the value a^
3
, for then only will there
be
no
further
infinitesimal
transformations
possible when
a point, a line through
it, and a plane through the
line are
fixed.
We
shall
find
that, under the present circumstances
the expression
is an absolute invariant.
If the distance of two points (x),
(>])
be
rf, we shall have
^ _ f (])\
This
function
is
continuous
and
real,
and
satisfies
the
functional equation
f(D)+f(D')=f(D + V).

CHAPTER XIX
THE DIFFERENTIAL BASIS FOR EUCLIDEAN
AND NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY
WE saw
in Chapter XV, Theorem
17, that the
Gaussian
curvature of a surface is equal to the sum of the total relative
curvature, and the measure
of curvature of space.
A
noii-
euclidean plane is thus a surface of Gaussian curvature equal
to

This fact was also brought out in Chapter V, Theorem 3,
A/"
1
and we
there promised
to return in the
present chapter to
a more
extensive examination
of
this
aspect
of
our
non-
euclidean geometry.
In Chapter
II, Theorem
30, we saw that the sum of the
distances from a point to any other two, not collinear with
it, when such a sum
exists,
is
greater than the distance
of
these latter.
We thus come naturally to look upon a straight
line as a geodesic, or curve of minimum length between two
points.
A plane may be generated by a pencil of geodesies
through a point
; the geometrical simplicity of the plane may
be said to arise from the
fact that
it
is capable of
oo 2 such
generations.
The
task
which
we
now
undertake
is
as
follows
:
to
determine
the
nature
of
a
three-dimensiona]
point-manifold which possesses the property that every sur-
face generated by a pencil of geodesies has constant Gaussian
curvature.
We must
begin,
as
in
previous
chapters, with
a
sufficient
set of axioms.*
Definition. Any
set of objects which may be put into one
to one correspondence with sets of real values of three inde-
pendent coordinates z^ z^ z% shall be called points.
Definition. An assemblage of points shall be said to form
a restricted region^ when their coordinates are limited merely
by inequalities of the type
6 <,<<,
= 1,2,8.

first writer to approach the subject from this point of view was
Riomann, loc. cit.

and in a space of n-dimensions, will be fcmnd in Schur,

restricted region.
Limitation. We
shall restrict ourselves
to such a portion
of the original restricted region that for no point thereof shall
the discriminant of our quadratic form be zero.
This amounts
to confining ourselves to the original region, or to a smaller
restricted region within the original one.
Definition. The expression
shall be called the didaive element.
Definition. The assemblage of all points whose coordinates
are analytic functions of a single parameter shall be called an
analytic curve, or, more simply, a curve.
As we have defined
only those points whose coordinates are real, it is evident that
the functions involved in the
definition of a curve must be
real
also.
The
definite
integral
of
the
distance
element
between two chosen points along a curve shall be called the
length of the corresponding portion or arc of the curve.
If
the curve pass many times
through the chosen points,
the
expression length must be applied to that portion along which
the integration was performed.
Definition. An
arc
of
a curve between two
fixed
points
which
possesses
the property that the
first variation of
its
length is zero, shall be called geodesic arc.
The curve whereon
this
arc
lies
shall
be
called a
geodesic connecting
the two
points.

Hence two points of the region may be con-
nected by a single geodesic arc lying entirely therein.*
Theorem
1. Two points of a restricted region whose coor-
dinates differ by a sufficiently small amount may be connected
by a single geodesic arc lying wholly in a sufficiently small
restricted region which includes the two points.

on, suppose
that we

ourselves

such
a

region
that any two
points may be so connected by a single geodesic

When it vanishes, the geodesies

In

It will
also transform a
geodesic
surface
into
a
geodesic
surface,
for
it
is immediately evident that
we might have
defined a geodesic surface as generated by
those geodesies through a point which are perpendicular to
a chosen geodesic through that point.
It is now necessary to choose a particular coordinate system,
and we
shall make
use
of one which
will turn out
to be
identical
with
the
polar
coordinate
system
of
elementary
geometry.
Let
us
choose
a
fixed
point
(z) 9 and a
fixed
geodesic through
it with direction cosines ().
Finally, we
choose a geodesic surface determined by our given geodesic,
and another through (z).
Let $ be the angle which a geodesic
through (0) makes with the geodesic (f), while 6 is the angle
which
a geodesic
perpendicular to
the
last chosen
geodesic
and to (C) makes with a geodesic perpendicular to the given
geodesic
surface,
i.e.
perpendicular
to
the geodesies of the
generating pencil.
Let r be the length of the geodesic arc of
() from (2) to a chosen point.
We may take <, 0, r as coor-
dinates
of
this
point.
The square
of
the

We see, in fact, that there will be no term in drd<t> or drdO.
For
if we take
= const, we have a geodesic
surface, and
the geodesic lines of space radiating from (z) and lying in
this
surface
will
be geodesies
of the
surface.
The curves
r = const, will be orthogonal
to these
radiating geodesies.*
The
surfaces
<f> = const,
are not geodesic
surfaces, but
the
curves
= const, and r = const, form an orthogonal system for
the same reason as before.
The coefficients E, F,
are indepen-
dent of

from one surface

The coefficient

arc lying
therein.
Theorem
2.
The geodesic connecting two
near
points
of
a geodesic surface lies wholly in that surface, and is identical
with the
geodesic of the
surface which connects those two
points.
Theorem, 3. There
is a group of
oc3 congruent transforma-
tions which carry a geodesic surface transitively into itself.
Theorem, 4.
All
geodesic surfaces have the same constant
Gaussian curvature.
These theorems enable us to solve completely our differential
equations
(6).
The
Gaussian
curvature
of
each
geodesic
surface
is an
invariant
of
space which we may
call
its
measure of curvature.
We shall denote this constant by p

and distinguish with care the two following cases
p*0,

are
compatible
with
the
euclidean hyperbolic and elliptic hypotheses, and with these
alone.
Our
task
is now
completed.
At
bottom,
the
essential
feature of a geometrical system where the elements are points
is
the
expression
for
distance,
for
the
protective
theory
is
the same for a limited domain in all restricted regions.
We
have
established
our
distance formulae
three
several
times,
each time approaching the subject from a new point of view.
In Chapters I-IV we took as fundamental the concepts point,
distance, and sum
of distances.
We
reached
our
analytic
formulae by proceeding from elementary geometry to trigono-
metry, and then introducing a simple coordinate system, such
as we do when we
first take up
the study of elementary
analytic geometry.
The Chapters VI-XVII were devoted to
erecting a superstructure upon the foundation which we had
established.
In Chapter XVIII we took a fresh
start,
laid
down point line and separation as fundamental, constructed
the common project!ve geometry for all of our systems (except
the spherical, which would involve slight modifications), and
established the system
of projective
coordinates.
We then
introduced certain collineations called conyruent transforma-
tions, and worked around to our previous distance formulae
through group-theory.
In
the
present
chapter we took
as
fundamental the concepts point and correspondence of point
and coordinate
set.
The essentials in our development were
the distance element, the geodesic curve, and the space con-

stant,
or
measure
of
curvature.
We
reached
our
familiar
formulae
by means
of surface
theory,
integration, and
the
calculus of variations.
Which of the three methods of approach
is the best ?
To
this question no definite answer may be given, for that method
which
is best
for one purpose
is
not,
necessarily,
best
for
another.
The
first method depended upon the simplest and
most
natural
fundamental
conceptions, and
presupposed
a
minimum of mathematical knowledge.
It also corresponded
most closely to
the line of historical development.
On the
other hand
it
is the longest, even after cutting out a number
of theorems,
interesting
in themselves,
but not essential as
steps towards the ultimate goal.
The second method possessed
the advantage of beginning with the assumptions which serve
as a basis for the important subject of projective geometry
;
metrical
ideas
were
grafted upon
this
stem
as
a
natural
development.
Moreover, the fundamental importance of the
six-parameter
collineation
group
which
keeps
a
conic
or
quaclric invariant was brought
into the
clearest
light.
On
the
other
hand, we were
obliged
to
develop
a
coordinate
system, which to some readers might seem a trifle unnatural
or
forced, and exposed ourselves to being put down among
those whom the late Professor Tait has stigmatized as
' That
section
of mathematicians
for whom
transversals and
an-
harmonic pencils have a, to us, incomprehensible charm
3
.*
Our
third and last method is, beyond a peradventure, the quickest
and most direct
; and has the advantage of bringing out the
full
significance
of
the
space
constant.
It may,
however,
be urged with some justice, that too high a price has been
paid lor this directness, by assuming at the outset that space
is something whose elements depend in a definite manner on
three independent parameters.
The modern tendency
is
to
take a more abstract view,
to look upon
space,
in the
last
analysis, as a set of objects which can be arranged in multiple
series.f
The
battle
is more than half over when the coor-
dinate system has been
set
up.
No, there
is no answer to the question which method of
approach
is
the
best.
The
determining
choice among
the
three,
will,
in
the
end,
be
a
matter
of
personal
aesthetic
preference.
And
this
is
well.
Let
us not
forget
that,
in
large
measure, we
study
pure
mathematics
to
satisfy an
aesthetic need. We are fortunate when, as in the present case,
we are free at the outset to choose our line of approach.
