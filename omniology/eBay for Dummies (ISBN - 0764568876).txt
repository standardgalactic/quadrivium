About the Author
Marsha Collier spends a good deal of time on eBay. She loves
buying and selling (she’s a Power Seller), as well as meeting eBay
users from around the world. As a columnist, author of two best-
selling books on eBay, and guest lecturer at eBay University,
Marsha shares her knowledge of eBay with millions of online
shoppers.
Out of college, Marsha worked in fashion advertising for the Miami
Herald; then she worked as Special Projects Coordinator for the
Los Angeles Daily News. Upon the birth of her daughter in 1984,
she founded a home-based advertising and marketing business.
Her successful business, the Collier Company, Inc., was featured
by Entrepreneur magazine in 1985, and in 1990, Marsha’s company
received the Small Business of the Year award from her California
State Assemblyman and the Northridge Chamber of Commerce.
More than anything, Marsha loves to get a great deal — that’s what
drew her to eBay in 1996 —  and that’s what keeps her busy at
the site now. She buys everything from replacement toothbrush
heads to parts for pool equipment to designer dresses. Marsha
knows how to work eBay, and in this book she shares that knowl-
edge with you.


Dedication
For my Mother, Claire Berg, who taught me how to shop for quality
on a budget, and who I miss every day.
For my daughter Susan Dickman, who continues to help me perfect
that talent.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to my husband, Beryl Lockhart, and my daughter Susan, for
putting up with the fact that eBay has taken over my life. I promise
to take a day off soon. Also, thanks to the gang at Wiley: Andy
Cummings (my unpretentious publisher); Steve Hayes, who’s
always there for me, and Nicole Haims, a darn good editor; without
her expertise, this book wouldn’t be as good.
Also, a big thanks to the eBay sellers that put up with my phone
calls and inquiries; Patti “Louise” Ruby (aunt*patti), Steve
Lindhorst (greenfuz), Wendy Warren (mrswarren), Shelly from
Shoetime, and Rosalinda from the Auction Guild.

eBay Bargain Shopping For Dummies 
xviii

Introduction
R
ecently I called a store to find out if it had a specific item in
stock. “Oh yes,” the sales clerk replied, “We have it, but we
can’t quote the price over the phone — you’ll have to come into
the store to find out the price.”
So I went to the store. Not only didn’t the store have what I was
looking for, but the sales clerk tried to sell me a completely differ-
ent product than the one I came in for. There is nothing worse than
knowing that your time is being wasted.
I went back to my office, ran a search at eBay, ordered exactly
what I needed — at 40 percent off the retail price — and it arrived
in the mail three days later. I should have tried eBay first. eBay
has become the world’s online marketplace. It’s mine now and it
should be yours.
eBay found its way onto my computer in 1996, very early on. My
daughter’s hobby at the time was replacing her She-Ra Princess of
Power action figures, which I had long previously sold at a garage
sale. eBay saved my reputation as the mother who got rid of her
collection. We replaced every figure with action figures that were
MOC (that is, mint on card). I wasn’t the only one shopping for
action figures at eBay. In fact, the company attributes its initial
growth to the Beanie Baby craze!
But as the eBay user base grew, savvy sellers tried to merchandise
more than just collectibles. Today, eBay has gone past its status as
an online auction house — it’s now an international marketplace
for everything, new and old. Famous manufacturers have their own
outlets on the site, side by side the small mom-and-pop specialty
boutiques.
I won’t bore you with my entire shopping list, but as you can see,
I’ve found a store that’s open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You
can afford to purchase things at eBay that you wouldn’t ordinarily
have the time to seek out or even afford in the bricks-and-mortar
world.

About This Book
I’ve written this book so that you, too, can learn to take advantage
of the megastore that is eBay. This book shows you how to get the
bargains and stay safe in every major category of merchandise
eBay offers.
Keep this book in your hands to help you feel at ease at eBay. I’d like
to call it eBay For Dummies Light, but my publisher won’t let me
mess with the trademark. And really, it’s not an accurate name. This
book is just as packed with information as my larger For Dummies
books, eBay For Dummies, 3rd Edition, and Starting an eBay Business
For Dummies. The information in this book is simply targeted toward
your interest in hunting for bargains.
There are great bargains to find, and down the road there’s always
the chance for you to sell some of the knick knacks that are collect-
ing dust in your own closet. But the goal of this book is to help you
reach your comfort zone to buy the things you want and need in
your life, without dragging yourself all over town or spending wads
of cash.
In this book, you’ll find out
 How the eBay megastore (Web site) is laid out
 How to browse for your item by category and theme
 How to set up the search engine to sniff out the best deals
 What to look for when shopping for a particular item
 How to stay safe and protect your hard-earned money
Foolish Assumptions
If you’ve been intimidated by eBay in the past, your buying this
book tells me a few things about you. First, I assume that you’d
like to spend less time and money shopping for things that
you’d like to own; second, I assume that you’d like to get in
on all those bargains your neighbor keeps telling you he gets at
eBay — but you don’t want to make a career of buying and selling
at eBay.
eBay Bargain Shopping For Dummies 
2

Here are some additional assumptions I’ve made:
 You have a computer with an Internet connection, or plan on
getting one in the very near future.
 You are short on time and don’t want to struggle through
pages of techno-babble or dig around at the eBay Web site get-
ting up to speed.
 You want to take your time and read this book at your leisure.
 You’re nervous about possible fraud and want to know about
the dangers of online shopping (without the hype) so that you
can stay safe. To be forewarned is to be forearmed.
 You don’t want to pay retail prices.
If you can say a resounding yes! to most of these assumptions, then
this is the book for you. Read on!
How to Use This Book
This book is written so that you can read it in the fashion most
comfortable to you. You can pick it up and read a bit, then put it
down and pick it up again later. If you have a specific need or ques-
tion, use the index or the Table of Contents to narrow down to just
what you’re looking for and go there.
This book is not written in linear style, which means that my editor
double-checks to see that each chapter carries its own message;
and you don’t have to jump around; but if you want to, you can read
Chapter 7, move on to Chapter 4, and skip ahead to Chapter 19,
depending on your interests.
I do recommend that you read Chapter 1 before you get too far
along so that you can find out what you need to know to become a
registered eBay user.
How This Book Is Organized
Each part of this book covers an individual area of eBay. You should
be able to find just what you’re looking for in the specific chapters.
If any task requires prior knowledge, I will point to the particular
chapter where you will find the nuggets you need to know.
Introduction
3

Part I: Opening Up the 
Bargain-Filled World of eBay
In this part, I explain the basic layout of eBay — where to find what
and how, and how to blast through the registration and bidding
process. I also show you how to use eBay’s online tools to keep
your shopping organized. 
You can find how to make your way through the site — and when
you’re through with this part, you should be comfortable with
shopping at eBay.
Part II: Staying Safe While
Shopping at eBay
Perhaps the reason you haven’t added eBay to your shopping
repertoire is because you’ve thought of eBay as a big scary place.
You’ve read enough stories in the media about online transaction
problems and you certainly don’t want to become a victim of some
notorious scammer. In this part, I show you how to stay safe and
tell you what to do if you think you’ve got a problem.
In this part I also show you the safest ways to pay for your eBay
purchases and protect your identity online.
Part III: Searching eBay
This section hones in on how eBay organizes the items for sale,
and shows you how to cruise eBay’s categories for something you
didn’t know you needed.
I’ll teach you some special tricks (previously known only to geeks
and eBay pros) to tweak eBay’s search engine so you can locate
the exact item you’re looking for.
Part IV: Shopping for Specific Items
By wending your way through the eBay categories, you can do
most of your shopping from the privacy of your own home. You
won’t believe some of the fun and unusual items that I’ve found at
eBay. The chapters in this part reveal what a great place eBay is to
eBay Bargain Shopping For Dummies 
4

shop; I guarantee that you will discover an item or two you never
would have expected were for sale at eBay.
Part V: Specialty Shopping
One of the wonderful things about eBay is that it lets you shop
your way. First, there are the specialty sites, such as Sothebys.com,
which allow you to bid (or simply watch the auction action from
the sidelines) in more high-stakes auctions. Also, if you like the
products sold by a particular seller, find out whether the seller has
his or her own store.
One of the best ways to shop your own way is to stay close to home.
Of course, you could always buy that piano from 2,000 miles away
(and pay for the shipping), but you might also check the Regional
page to find out if there’s a Steinway available in the next town over.
If you like browsing aisle after aisle of closeouts, then the online
version of the bricks-and-mortar liquidation stores, provided by
eBay, is right up your alley. Have fun, but be sure you read the fine
print. I tell you everything you need to know in Chapter 17.
Part VI: Going for the Gold
eBay is far more than a collectibles auction venue these days. High-
dollar items make up a large part of the daily transactions at eBay.
Did you know that more cars are sold at eBay than almost any-
where else? Think about it. If you’re looking for a special vintage
car, or even a good reliable car to take you to work, you’ve got
everything from certified pre-owned cars to brand-new cars
straight from the dealers’ lots to the cars that were only driven to
church on Sundays by the little old lady down the way.
There’s also a tremendous market in real estate — open land in
Colorado; homes in North Carolina; timeshares in Florida. 
Own your own piece of America from your armchair — right here
at eBay. This part gives you tips on what to look for and tells you
what questions to ask.
Fine jewelry has become de rigueur at eBay for the cognoscenti.
(That means the smart folks are getting the good stuff at eBay for
bargain basement prices!) I’ll show you how to join them and know
just how to find the deals.

Part VII: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is the most-fun part of an already very fun book.
I’ve listed my ten favorite reasons that shopping at eBay is fun.
And I asked several eBay sellers to advise new eBay bidders on the
things they need to know to be savvy bargain hunters at eBay.
Icons Used in This Book
When you see this icon, check for information that shortens your
learning cycle. These tips enable you to bypass some of the more
onerous tasks and complete your goal in a more direct manner.
Remember when Mom would wag her finger at you, while repeating
an oft-heard phrase, just to drive home an important truism? Same
thing here. Although I try not to be a nag, the important nuggets
you find in these icons are things you should not forget.
This small icon signifies some piece of information that, ignored,
could get you into a bit of trouble. By following this warning
symbol, you’ll stay on the side of safety.
Graphics and Screen Images
eBay is a graphically driven Web site. eBay programmers and prod-
uct people work night and day tweaking and improving the site for
eBay users. In other words, sometimes what you see on-screen
may not match the screen images in the printed book. As hard as
my editor and I try, no printed book can ever keep up with the
sharp minds of this nimble crew. 
Pages at eBay may change, but the philosophies in this book will
remain intact. Once you master the information in this book, no
matter what changes are made to the site, you will be able to
follow what’s going on on-screen.
We’ve also made this book a convenient size so that you can tuck it
discreetly into your meeting notes or into your purse. That calls
for some creativity on our part so that we can show you only
what’s worth seeing. I trimmed all evidence of the Internet browser
out of the on-screen images. You all know what your browser looks
like, so I won’t bore you with details that aren’t needed.

Where to Go from Here
The beginning is a very good place to start. If you’re already regis-
tered at eBay, and are ready to jump in, find a spot in the book that
covers something new to you and start there. 
Once you’ve got some of the basics under your belt, take your Web
browser to www.ebay.com and poke around. I highly recommend
poking around before actually buying something — you won’t miss
the best bargain to come along in the century — there’s always
another up at eBay!
Please visit my Web site, www.coolebaytools.com. (Cool eBay
Tools, get it?) See if there’s some additional information there that
can help you. I always enjoy readers’ comments and suggestions,
so you can also send e-mail to me from my site.
Happy shopping!

eBay Bargain Shopping For Dummies

Part I
Opening Up the
Bargain-Filled
World of eBay

In this part. . . 
P
art I of this book shows you how to use eBay tools to
your best advantage. After reading these chapters,
you’ll no longer be intimidated by the eBay forms and
pages. You’ll also learn my deepest, darkest eBay shop-
ping secrets. Apply these secrets to all the other tips in
this book, and you may never have to drag yourself from
store to store to buy something again.

Chapter 1
Getting Started at eBay
In This Chapter
 Discovering the eBay community
 Understanding community values
 Finding everything your heart desires for sale
 Getting comfortable online
 Knowing what you need to get started
P
erhaps you’ve actually visited the eBay Web site once or twice
with the idea that you might buy something. Did you look for
something simple like a golf club? Did eBay come up with several
thousand listings? Or maybe you figured you’d get smart and
narrow it down to a search for a 3 iron, and you still got over a
thousand listings? Yes, I understand, dear reader. The eBay site
can be pretty daunting.
Maybe you started looking at listings and then got so scared that
you’d get ripped off that you just left the site. Don’t feel alone.
When you’re done reading this book, you’ll have the information
you need to be able to zip onto the site and find just what you’re
looking for, and to select the right seller to buy it from (at the best
price, of course).
I like to shop from home, and eBay works much better for me than
any quasi-convenient TV shopping channel because there’s no
overly-made-up huckster telling me how great I’d look in the outfit
on the screen (worn by a size 4 model). On the eBay site, I have the
opportunity to leisurely look the items over, read the descriptions
and terms (in my own time), and click a link to ask the seller a
question before I bid or buy. Using eBay is as simple as that. If
I don’t like the way a seller responds to my question, I can just
go on to the next one. That’s the great thing about eBay: There’s
always another seller and always another item for sale.

Nope, eBay Isn’t a Store
If you speak to any of the employees at eBay, they will clearly tell
you that eBay isn’t a store; it’s a venue. In the same way your high
school gym was a venue when you went to dances, eBay is a venue
for buyers and sellers. You had to follow the rules of the gym (and
the school) or you were booted out without ceremony. It’s the
same way at eBay. Everyone has to follow the rules, or you can
become a NARU (Not A Registered User) and banned from the site.
(Yes, eBay really does ban users — for life.)
In reality, eBay is the world’s largest online marketplace of goods
and services, used by the world’s largest community of individuals
and businesses.
In the beginning days of eBay, people used to refer to the site as a
giant online flea market or garage sale. But you can’t call it that
anymore. When you have mom-and-pop home operations (like
mine) successfully doing business head to head with Martha
Stewart, Sharper Image, and Ritz Camera (just to name a few),
you’ve got something really unique. The coolest part for buyers is
that anyone — from Martha Stewart to your next-door neighbor —
has an equal chance to buy the same quality goods at a bargain
price. It doesn’t matter who you are when you shop at eBay —
what matters is how you bid.
The eBay site really just gives sellers a great online home, a commu-
nity, to sell their goods, and supplies them necessary tools for online
trading in the auction-style and fixed-price selling formats. These
sellers can reach all over the world and offer buyers things that they
may never have been able to buy in their part of the country.
Community Values
When eBay originally came on to the Internet as Auction Web on
Labor Day 1995, its founder, Pierre Omidyar, set up ethical guide-
lines for users of the system to follow. To this day, eBay follows an
important credo of community values. Community values are so
important to the company that every eBay employee is issued a
copy of the values with his or her company ID security badge.
The eBay community is guided by these five fundamental values,
which are posted on the Web site:
 We believe people are basically good.
 We believe everyone has something to contribute.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
12

 We believe that an honest, open environment can bring out
the best in people.
 We recognize and respect everyone as a unique individual.
 We encourage you to treat others the way you want to be
treated.
When you register to bid or buy at eBay, you become a member of
the eBay community and agree to follow these rules.
Okay, I can see you scoffers out there in the back row. We all know
there are bad apples in every basket, and Part II of this book tells
you how to steer clear of them and what to do if you ever cross
paths with any of them. These are still good tenets to follow. 
Find Just about Anything to Buy
Most of the first items sold at eBay were collectibles. Word of the
early Web site spread like wildfire through Internet chat rooms and
newsgroups. To be perfectly honest, many people really weren’t
quite convinced that selling online would become anything more
than a hobby.
During the early days, I was selling Star Trek memorabilia at Auction
Web, and doing quite well. I remember running into William Shatner
(Captain Kirk of Star Trek fame) at a marketing meeting in mid-1997.
Anxious to let him know how well I was doing with my merchandise
online, I tried to explain Auction Web. Shatner scoffed, “No one will
ever make any money on the Internet.” (Really, I have witnesses —
remember this is the future Mr. Priceline.com.) Ah, well.
Today, you can buy everything at eBay — and I mean almost any-
thing you can imagine. eBay has over 18,000 categories and sub-
categories of items. (When I wrote the first edition of eBay For
Dummies in 1999, there were only 4,000 categories — and that
seemed like a lot of categories back then!) You can buy brand new
items, direct from a manufacturer or one of eBay’s stores or you
can buy slightly used goods. (Ever buy something at a sale, try it
on once, and decide it didn’t work for you?)
And there are always antiques, wholesale items, and unclaimed
freight! Many stores sell their returns at eBay, perfectly good items
in brand new condition that can’t legally be sold again as new.
Everything is here from fine art (Sotheby’s is currently auctioning
an original Rubens oil lamp with a starting bid of $1,000,000), a
Gulfstream jet (sold for $4.9 million), land (your own private island
in the Caribbean), to authentic antique furnishings, and more.
Chapter 1: Getting Started at eBay 13

In this book, I take you all over the eBay site, and you’ll be surprised
at some of the things you’ll find for sale! If you want to see some of
the truly amazing items, browse the big ticket items area (Figure 1-1)
at http://pages.eBay.com/buy/bigticket/index.html.
Things You Won’t Find at eBay
Scruples are alive and well at eBay. You’re forbidden from buying or
selling certain things. Here’s a list of some of the things you won’t
find on the site (you can find the entire list at http://pages.
ebay.com/help/community/png-items.html):
 Alcohol: Unless the alcohol is in a collectible container,
making the value of the container worth more than the con-
tents, you can’t buy hooch at the eBay site. But you may be
able to purchase wine from a licensed wine broker who has
been approved by eBay to sell spirits on the site. Oh yes, you
still have to be 21 to purchase it.
Wine can only be sold by dealers who have been vetted by
eBay as legally able to sell wine.
 Animals: No live animals may be sold, nor may any stuffed
migratory birds. Pelts and parts of any animal that’s an endan-
gered species are also forbidden.
Figure 1-1: Better bring your credit card, or maybe a T-bill, when you shop here.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
14

 Fireworks: The category of forbidden fireworks includes aerial
bombs, booby traps (pull string), bottle rockets, chasers,
daygo bombs, firecrackers, fountains, nitro poppers, party
poppers, roman candles, skyrockets, smoke balls, smoke
bombs, snap caps, snappers, sparklers, sparks, and torpedoes.
 Human Parts and Remains: Nope, you can’t buy a kidney,
sperm, or eggs at eBay. But if you’d like to purchase a real skull
or skeleton for educational purposes, it’s well within the rules.
 Weapons: No firearms, period. Not even if they are antique or
collectible. No hand weapons, nunchaku, throwing stars,
switchblades, or disguised knives.
 Miscellaneous no-no’s: No counterfeit currency, credit cards,
drugs and drug paraphernalia, or tobacco.
eBay understands that the community is made up of a diverse
group of people. Offensive material is not tolerated on the site. If
you’re into auctions that promote hatred, violence, or intolerance,
you’re out of luck. Such items are “judiciously disallowed.” You’re
also out of luck if you’re interested in items that promote organiza-
tions (such as the KKK, Nazis, neo-Nazis, and Aryan Nation) with
such views.
Please realize that I can’t possibly give you a complete list of forbid-
den or questionable items. If you really want to investigate this sub-
ject thoroughly, for a current listing go to http://pages.ebay.
com/help/community/png-items.html.
The eBay venue offers, of course, a very active Mature Audience
category. You’ll have to find it yourself because I don’t have the
space to cover it in the book. To enter the adult area (when you
find it in the Everything Else category), you have to be a registered
user of eBay with a valid credit card number on file — to verify
that you’re over 18 — and confirm agreement to the Mature
Audience category Terms of Use.
Feeling at Home Online
Do you use your computer often? Do you visit Web sites on a regu-
lar basis? If so, I don’t have to worry about you feeling at home
online. If you only use your computer for e-mail, you’re missing a
whole world of exciting information.
Chapter 1: Getting Started at eBay 15

Using search sites to find information
about auction items
You can use the Internet to research and establish prices for all
kinds of items, as well as keep you up on today’s trends and fash-
ions. Search engines, such as www.google.com, allow you to enter
almost any search phrase or a group of keywords. After you enter
the words that you would like more information on, a page appears
with a long list of relevant Web sites that can answer questions
about collectibles — and anything else you may have a question
about.
If you’re looking for price information about new items, check my
Web site, www.coolebaytools.com, for links to some street price
comparison sites for new items.
I also highly recommend John Levine, Carol Baroudi, and Margaret
Levine Young’s The Internet For Dummies, 8th Edition (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.). I discovered quite a few tricks for successfully
using Internet search engines in this well-written, funny, and
enlightening book.
Getting set up
You’re going to need several things to get started at eBay. The first
is the need to acquire items. (Somehow I don’t think this is going
to be a problem.) In order of importance, here’s the list:
 Credit card or bank account: Very important, as many sellers
are kind of picky when it comes to getting paid for the items
they sell to you. (For more information about paying for your
purchases safely, see Chapter 8.)
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
16
How fast is Google?
After running a search on one of my book titles, Google comes up with 22,700 ref-
erences that can be accessed with a click of my mouse. How long did this search
take? Only .05 seconds.
Google is so fast and convenient that I hardly ever look at my recipe books any-
more. When I want to know how to make something, I just type in the name of the
recipe on Google, and I’m usually presented with a choice of many versions of the
same item. I print it out (and save the recipe on my computer) and now I’m making
my own recipe books!

 Internet access: A home Internet connection through a local
ISP (Internet service provider) is the best, although many
people only log on to the Internet from work. (If your com-
pany has policies against such frivolities, beware.)
 Internet browser: On your home computer, you will have an
Internet browser. This is the software that enables you to
browse the Internet. In this book (and on my home com-
puter), I use Microsoft’s Internet Explorer.
 E-mail software: When you browse eBay and find items that
interest you, you may have questions for the seller. The seller
will respond via e-mail. To read the responses, along with
e-mail messages that eBay and other associated services like
PayPal send you, you need e-mail software. Luckily, this also
comes with your computer or is supplied by your ISP. I use
Microsoft Outlook, which is part of the Office suite, but
Outlook Express comes with almost every PC and does a great
job for everyday e-mail. (If you use Web-based e-mail, see the
sidebar titled, “Using Yahoo! or Hotmail? Grab your credit
card,” elsewhere in this chapter.)
 eBay User ID: Your ID is very important ! You’ve got to figure
out a name to use for your user identification name at eBay.
Think of a clever name that describes you or your hobbies. My
User ID is marsha_c. It’s not very creative (but then, I started at
eBay in 1996, and it worked fine for me then). I’m afraid to
change my ID now because no one would ever find me again!
Your eBay User ID has some rules. Your User ID must be at
least two characters long, can’t contain any spaces (but you
can use the underscore (_) or the dash (-) within the name), it
can’t be obscene or profane, and it can’t be a Web site or
e-mail address. You also can’t use “eBay” in your ID unless
you are an employee of eBay. eBay doesn’t allow the use of
the symbols @, <, >, and &, and it also doesn’t allow the use of
the letter “e” followed by numbers. By the way, eBay User IDs
can’t be traded or sold.
Registering to Do Business at eBay
You can browse eBay all you want without registering, but before
you transact any sort of business at eBay, you must register.
I recommend registering while you’re reading this book. The
moment you’re armed with all this information, you’ll be ready to
go shopping and you won’t want to miss even one bargain!
Chapter 1: Getting Started at eBay 17

You can browse eBay without a User ID, but you can’t place
a single bid without being a registered member of the eBay 
community.
Here’s what you need to do:
1. Get yourself to the eBay home page at www.ebay.com
(shown in Figure 1-2).
You see an area that says Welcome New Users. Within that
area is a hyperlink box that beckons to you: Register Now.
2. Ready? Go ahead, click that box!
After you click the Register Now hyperlink box, you’ll come
to the first of the registration pages, as shown in Figure 1-3.
Notice two things when you get to this page:
• At the top of the page, eBay tells you that by regis-
tering here you are also registering at Half.com
(very convenient — for more about Half.com, flip
to Chapter 17).
• At the bottom of your browser window in the status bar
on either the left- or right-side lower-right corner is a
small padlock icon or a solid key icon that didn’t
appear before.
Figure 1-2: Where the magic begins.
Click here to register.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
18

Figure 1-3: The first Secure Registration page.
The padlock icon means that eBay has moved you to a
secure place on its site where no one else can see or
receive your personal information. Your information is
treated with the highest security, and you can fill out
these forms with the utmost level of confidence.
3. Type your name, address, and telephone number.
Press the Tab key (or using the mouse to relocate your
cursor) to move between text entry boxes.
This information is important if eBay ever needs to get in
touch with you. Also, if you’re involved in a transaction
with another eBay member and he or she needs to get in
touch with you, the other member can request your phone
number as well as your city and state.
Don’t fool around, like I did with my address in Figure 1-3.
eBay’s computers match zip codes and area codes and will
catch errors!
4. Further down the page, you need to enter your e-mail
address.
In fact, you have to type your e-mail address in two sepa-
rate boxes so that eBay can be sure that you didn’t mistype
the address. It’s critical to your registration. eBay will send
you an e-mail with information you need to complete the
process when you finish this page.
Chapter 1: Getting Started at eBay 19

It is safe to use your personal e-mail address for eBay regis-
tration. You will not be put on any e-mail lists.
5. Enter your desired User ID.
Don’t strain your brain too much right now over your
choice of User ID. If your chosen ID is taken, eBay has a
cute little tool to help you select one. All you have to do is
enter the information asked for (see Figure 1-4) and click
the Suggest Some User IDs button.
If you find yourself unhappy with your initial choice, you
can change it again next month. In fact, you can change
your User ID once every 30 days if you like.
Figure 1-4: The eBay Instant User ID widget form.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
20
Using Yahoo! or Hotmail?
Grab your credit card
Sellers must register at eBay with a credit or debit card to pay for their eBay fees;
buyers do not. That is, unless they choose to use a free, Web-based e-mail account
like those offered by Yahoo! or Hotmail. Most free e-mail services do not verify their
users, so for the protection of all eBay users, eBay requires people with a free, Web-
based e-mail account to register a credit card for identification purposes. Your credit
card will not be charged.

When you change your User ID at eBay, an icon of a very
suspicious looking pair of sunglasses appears next to your
User ID. These shades stay with you for 30 days. There’s
nothing intrinsically wrong with the shades; however,
double-check when you see a seller with a pair of these
shades next to his or her name because the seller may have
just changed his or her User ID to distract from a bad repu-
tation. The good news is that users who change their IDs
can’t hide their reputations completely. You can find out the
dirt on any eBay user by reading his or her feedback profile.
(You can read more about feedback in Chapter 5.)
6. Pick your password.
The best passwords for eBay (or any Web site, for that
matter) consist of over six characters and are a combina-
tion of letters and numbers. Never use your User ID as a
password, your name, your pet’s name, your address, or
anything that may be easily known by others. C’mon, get
a little cagey, you can do it. Get creative here. 
7. Select a secret question.
The secret question is used to help you remember your
password, should you forget it. There are six choices. I sug-
gest that you select a question other than “What is your
mother’s maiden name?” because this question is often
used by banks and financial institutions for identification
purposes. Guard your mother’s maiden name and don’t
give it out to anyone blithely.
8. Supply your birth date.
The people at eBay want this information for two reasons: 
• They want to be sure that you are of legal age to do busi-
ness at eBay.
• They want to send you e-mail wishing you a happy 
birthday!
9. When you have completely filled out the entire form,
click the Continue button.
On the page that appears, you’re asked to agree to eBay’s
User Agreement. Boil this agreement down to its basics,
and the agreement says that you will play by the rules, that
you know that every bid you place is a legally binding bid
to buy, and so on. 
I recommend you take a look at the rules. If you don’t agree
with them, you can’t join the community. The rules are for
everyone’s protection. 
Chapter 1: Getting Started at eBay 21

You are also presented with the eBay Privacy Policy, which
is one of the most comprehensive privacy policies I’ve ever
seen on the Internet. eBay’s commitment to protecting
your privacy is another part of eBay’s successful formula to
keep its users happy and secure.
10. Click to add a check mark in the box to assure you are
over 18, and then click to add a check mark in the box
that says that you know that you can choose to opt out of
mailings from eBay.
11. After checking the two boxes, click the button that says I
Agree To These Terms.
See Figure 1-5.
After completing the registration, you can go to your My
eBay page and change your notification preferences. (I
show you how to do this in Chapter 4.) 
You’re also notified that an e-mail message has been sent to
the address you supplied during your registration.
12. Open your e-mail program (if it isn’t already open), and
receive your e-mail.
When you open the message from eBay, the e-mail looks
strikingly similar to the e-mail message shown in Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-5: You’re almost done!
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
22

Figure 1-6: Registration e-mail.
13. Follow the instructions on the e-mail. Click the button
that says Complete eBay Registration.
If the link doesn’t work, go to http://pages.eBay.com/
register and enter the confirmation code that appears in
your e-mail.
In the very unlikely event that this e-mail does not reach
you, go to http://pages.eBay.com/services/
registration/reqtemppass.html and enter your e-mail
address.
14. Click the Submit button.
You will receive another e-mail with a special one-time 
confirmation password.
After you reconnect with eBay through the Complete
Registration button or by typing this URL into your Web
browser, and you have submitted your registration code, a
page that says Congratulations, you are registered
appears. Welcome to the world’s largest community of
savvy shoppers! Now the fun begins.

Chapter 2
Bidding, Buying, and Winning
In This Chapter
 Signing in and having fun
 Buying your item
 Correcting mistakes
 Winning and checking out
A
lthough this book is loaded with fun and exciting eBay shop-
ping tips, you don’t have to finish reading it before you decide
to log on and buy something. Here’s the chapter where I take you
through the paces of bidding, buying, winning, and finalizing your
purchase.
Before you buy or bid, you need to understand how the different
types of sales at eBay work, and how to take the best advantage
of them.
Signing In
The first thing you need to do is sign in. I’m telling you this from
personal experience. You can’t do anything worthwhile at eBay
without signing in. Usually, as soon as my browser hits the eBay
site, I get excited about an item, but I can’t bid on it because I’m
not signed in. At times like these, signing in seems like a horren-
dous, tortuous task. So save yourself the trouble — sign in now.
Click the Sign In link above the Navigation bar. The Sign In page,
shown in Figure 2-1, appears.
You see a link on the page (indicated on Figure 2-1 by the hand
shaped cursor) asking if you want to sign in via eBay’s secure server.
If you’re the secure type, click the link, and you’re redirected to
eBay’s secure server. (A small padlock or a key also appears in the
lower-left or right corner of your browser window.)

Figure 2-1: The eBay Sign In page.
Type your User ID, password, and if this computer is at home and
solely for your own use, click in the box that says Keep Me Signed
In on This Computer.
If there is a chance that someone else may use the computer, do
not click in this box. If you do, eBay will keep your User ID and
password active on that computer. This is not a good thing if you
don’t know the other people who might be using the computer;
anyone else can start bidding on your account!
By the way, you also see a Sign In link on the bottom of the page for
Microsoft Passport account holders. If you’re not a Passport
account holder, don’t worry about this link; if you are, you may
sign in here.
After you’ve signed in, you’re presented with links to go to your My
eBay page, the Sell Your Item page, or the Announcement Board.
You’re going shopping, so you can either click the eBay logo to go
to the eBay home page, or on the search box in the Navigation Bar
to start searching for the perfect item.
Getting Into the Action
You’ve just found the item you want. It’s perfect — you want it, and
you want it now. You have checked out the seller’s feedback and
you’re ready to bid.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
26

When this situation arises (and it will) your knowledge of eBay’s
sales formats becomes important. In this section, I go over the var-
ious instances and types of sales, and show you the ways to suc-
cessfully make it through each of them.
Your bid on an eBay item is a legally binding contract. eBay treats
every bid, other than bids on some real estate sales or incorrectly
placed bids, as binding. If you win an auction and do not go through
with your commitment by purchasing the item, the seller will file a
Non-Paying Bidder notice about you. If you establish a history as
a non-paying bidder at eBay (that is, you repeatedly back out of
sales), you have a strong chance of getting suspended.
Understanding the value 
of an auction item
How much an item sells for depends on how many people see the
item, and how badly other bidders want it. You may think of the
retail price or book value as a standard for pricing; yet neither may
be accurate when it comes to shopping at eBay. In fact, I always
say there are three prices for everything:
 The price a retailer charges for an item at the store
 The price everyone says something is worth
 The price an item actually sells for at eBay
All auctions at eBay run from 3 to 10 days, and at the end of the
auction, the highest bidder wins the item. There are a lot on
nuances on how to finesse the bidding process (see Chapter 3),
but before you get into all that, you should understand the basics
of how the system works, so read on.
Getting into the auction
frame of mind
To give you a real-world sense of the auction process, here’s a real-
world example of my chocoholism put to the eBay test. I’ve found
an item that I want, an order of homemade chocolate truffle bars.
After reading the seller’s feedback (and skipping lunch), I want
them even more!
Not one of this seller’s previous buyers was unhappy with the
product. As a matter of fact, no one seems able to say enough
Chapter 2: Bidding, Buying, and Winning 27

about the quality of this candy. Yum! If it’s really good, I can always
buy more later and send them to partners as holiday gifts. (That’ll
make my shopping a tax write-off, no?)
As you look at the auction (shown in Figure 2-2), observe several
things. The starting bid is $9.95, and the auction ends in over four
days.
Figure 2-2: Something I really want to win.
You have several directions you can go in at this point. I have
observed that auctions of this type of merchandise have a very
active bidding pattern, so at this early stage I would suggest bidding
the minimum amount just to get the item to show up as one of the
items I’m bidding and watching from the My eBay page.
Bidding can often be like a game of poker; if you really want to win
a one-of-a-kind item, don’t show your hand to other bidders.
Simply mark the auction to Watch. See Chapter 4 for instructions
on how to watch an auction. However, for an item like this, which
I’m sure will show up at eBay again, I wouldn’t play my cards so
close to my chest.
When it comes to auctions, the highest bid wins. Remember this
please. People are constantly boo-hooing because they’ve been
outbid at the last minute (or sniped, as I explain in Chapter 3). You
can’t be outbid if you are the high bidder!
If you’re interested in an item but you don’t have the time to follow
it closely from the beginning of the auction to its conclusion, you
can place a proxy bid. See the following section, aptly called “Proxy
bidding,” for more information.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
28

Proxy bidding
Bidding at eBay goes up by pre-prescribed increments. But what if
you’re not able to sit in on an auction 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week, upping your bid every time someone bids against you? (You
mean you have a life?)
You do receive e-mail messages from eBay to let you know that
you’ve been outbid, but experienced eBay buyers will tell you that
waiting for an outbid notice (especially on an item you really want)
is courting danger. The computers at eBay are often busy doing
other things, and you might not get the notice in time to place a
new competitive bid.
Enter eBay’s proxy bidding system. Proxy bidding is the perfect
way to place your bid for the highest amount you are willing to pay
for an item — without wasting your valuable time.
Before you place your proxy bid, you should give serious thought
to how much you want to pay for the item. Look at Table 2-1 for
eBay’s actual bidding increments.
Table 2-1
eBay’s Bidding Increments
Current High Bid
Next Bid Increased By
$.01 to 0.99
$.05
$1.00 to 4.99
$.25
$5.00 to 24.99
$.50
$25.00 to 99.99

$1,000 to $2,499.99
$25
$2,500 to 4,999.99
$50
$5,000 and up
$100
When you place a proxy bid at eBay, eBay’s bidding engine submits
a bid that’s high enough to barely outbid the current high bidder. If
Chapter 2: Bidding, Buying, and Winning 29

the auction has no other bidders, your bid will appear as the mini-
mum auction bid until someone bids against you, and is increased
incrementally in response to other bids against yours.
No other eBay members know how much your proxy bid is.
Placing a bid
To place a proxy bid in an auction, scroll to the bottom of the page,
and type in your maximum bid, and click the Place Bid button, as
shown in Figure 2-3.
If the seller has set a Buy It Now price, and you’re too impatient to
wait until the end of the auction to win, click Buy It Now.
Figure 2-3: Enter your high bid or click Buy It Now.
A confirmation page appears, as shown in Figure 2-4.
You have one last chance to back out. If everything is in order, click
either Buy It Now or Confirm Bid (depending on the type of trans-
action). Your transaction is not placed until you do this. If you get
cold feet, click Back to Item. To find out more about the Buy It Now
option, see “Buying Your Item Outright,” later in this chapter.
The next page, shown in Figure 2-5, lets you know whether you’re
the high bidder (or whether your purchase has been confirmed if
you decided to Buy It Now).
If you’re not the high bidder in an auction, just scroll down
the acknowledgement page to the rebidding square and place
another bid.

30

Figure 2-4: Confirm your bid.
Figure 2-5: You just bought it now!
Understanding reserve prices
You’ll often come across auctions, like the one in Figure 2-6, that
have the words Reserve has not been met next to the bid
amount. This means that the seller has protected his outlay in the
item by placing a reserve on the bidding. By placing a reserve on
the auction, the seller ensures that the item will not sell until the
bidding reaches the mysterious reserve figure.
To save yourself time and trouble, if you’re really interested in an
item with a reserve, e-mail the seller and politely ask him (or her)
how much the reserve is. Some sellers guard the reserve amount
like the crown jewels, and other sellers will graciously reveal the
figure. The point of the reserve is to protect their investment and
get qualified bidders, not waste your time.
Chapter 2: Bidding, Buying, and Winning 31

Figure 2-6: A reserve price auction for a lovely purse.
Private auctions
Private auctions are handled exactly the same way as plain-vanilla
auctions, except for the fact that no one other than the buyer and
the seller knows who the winner is. As a matter of fact, all bidders’
names are hidden from investigation from anyone not bidding in
the transaction.
After you’ve been at eBay a while, you’ll see the same group of 
bidders bidding in the same auctions as you, you’ll have similar
tastes. Private auctions are very handy for snaring items secretly
without your regular competitor knowing that you’re bidding on
the item (see Chapter 3 for bidding strategies).
Dutch auctions
A Dutch auction allows a seller to auction off multiple identical
items (see Figure 2-7). You can bid on one or as many of the items
as you wish. When the total number of items has been bid upon at
the opening price, the next bids will have to beat the previous bids
by one bidding increment.
When the auction is over, all winning bidders (those with the 
highest bids) win their items at the lowest bid price. I know that
sounds ridiculous, but that’s the way it works. I’m only reporting
this — it must have taken a very creative mind to come up with
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
32

this theory of auctions. If you want a more in-depth description of
the Dutch process, go to http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/
buyer-multiple.html.
Figure 2-7: A Dutch auction for some really hard-to-find batteries 
for my alarm system.
To place a bid in a Dutch auction, you must input the amount of
items you want to bid on and the amount you wish to bid per item,
as shown in Figure 2-8.

Chapter 2: Bidding, Buying, and Winning 33

Buying Your Item Outright
Although eBay’s success was built on auctions, the eBay company
philosophy is that for everyone to grow and prosper, the auction
venue ought to branch out and allow sellers to handle outright
sales. There are three ways to buy outright at eBay. You can make
a direct purchase
 In one of eBay’s stores (as I discuss in Chapter 16). Stores
offer exclusive items that aren’t on the auction block. All
items in stores are for sale at a posted price.
 In fixed price sales on the auction site.
 Using the Buy It Now feature.
Buy It Now
You may have already looked at auctions and sees a Buy It Now
price next to the minimum or starting bid amount. That little indi-
cator means that if you want the item badly enough, and the Buy It
Now price is within your budget for the item, you can end the auc-
tion right then and there by buying the item for that amount. Take
a look at Figure 2-9 to see what I mean.
Figure 2-9: An auction offering the Buy It Now option.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
34

Before using the Buy It Now option (because you think you’ve hit
upon a bargain) be sure to check the seller’s shipping charges.
Many sellers set a low Buy It Now price, but place a high shipping
amount on the item to make up their missing profits. If the shipping
amount isn’t listed, be sure to e-mail the seller and ask for the ship-
ping amount. A Buy It Now transaction is final, and you can’t with-
draw your bid to buy.
If you decide that you want to buy, scroll down to the bottom of
the page and click the Buy It Now button. An eBay confirmation
page appears, and if you still want to make the purchase, you can
confirm the purchase price. Then all you have to do is go through
the checkout process and pay the seller.
If you come across an auction with the Buy It Now option, you can
still place a bid. When a bid is placed on a Buy It Now item that has
no reserve, the option to immediately buy disappears, and the
item goes into strict auction mode. If the item has a reserve, the
Buy It Now option disappears when the reserve is met.
Fixed-price sales
You may often come across items for sale at eBay without the
option to bid. These are fixed-price listings and may be for a single
item or for multiple items. You can buy as many as you like.
Yikes! I Made a Mistake!
We’re all human and we make mistakes. Luckily for everyone,
eBay members are allowed to retract bids under certain extreme
circumstances.
You may retract your bid if you meet one of the following criteria:
 You accidentally typed in the wrong bid amount: Say you
typed $900 and you meant $9.00. Oops. In a case like this, you
can retract the bid, but you’d better rebid the proper amount
(that original $9.00) immediately, or you may be in violation of
eBay’s policies.
 The seller has added information to the item description
that changes the value of the item considerably: The bull
that was let loose in the seller’s shop has changed the mint
condition of the Ming vase you just bid on? No problem.
Chapter 2: Bidding, Buying, and Winning 35

 You can’t reach the seller through eBay’s e-mail or through
the telephone number you got from eBay’s find members
area: Seller gone AWOL and you have a question about an
item you’ve bid on? You can use eBay’s e-mail system by click-
ing the Ask the Seller a Question link in the seller’s box on the
auction page.
Every time you retract a bid, it will appear on your eBay ID
card on your feedback area.
Here are a couple of additional bid retraction restrictions:
 You can only retract a bid if it was placed prior to the last
12 hours of an auction: If you bid more than once in the last
12 hours of the same auction, only your last bid will be
retracted.
 When you retract a bid because of a bidding error, you
wipe out any and all of your previous bids in the auction
and you must bid again immediately to reinstate yourself as
a bidder: If you must retract your bid within the last 12 hours,
you must send an e-mail to the seller asking him or her to
cancel your bid. It is totally up to the seller whether to cancel
your bid. 
 A bid retraction isn’t a guarantee that you will get out of
purchasing the item: Sometimes, sellers simply don’t have
the opportunity or time to cancel a bid. That means you have
to buy the item.
eBay vigorously investigates members who abuse bid retractions.
Too many bid retractions and you may find yourself suspended
from the system.
You’ll probably never need this link, but to retract your bid (or
find more information), go to http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/
eBayISAPI.dll?RetractBidShow.

Got a question? Let your fingers
do the, um, typing
To get the seller’s telephone number go to the Search area, click Find Members,
and input your transaction number and the seller’s User ID. The good people at eBay
will check to be sure that you’ve begun a transaction with this person, you’ll get the
seller’s telephone number via e-mail to your registered e-mail address. Your phone
number will also be e-mailed to the seller.

Winning the Auction and
Checking Out
After you win the auction, or buy an item in a Buy It Now or fixed-
price transaction, it’s convenient to be able to pay directly and
immediately. If it’s after you’ve won, you can go back to the item
and see a Check Out link on the item page.
Many sellers use off-site services to process payments like
AuctionWorks or Channel Advisor. These services are very
common and safe. Check out Chapter 8 for information on how to
pay safely.

Chapter 3
Bargain Shopping Secrets
Exposed!
In This Chapter
 Timing your bid
 Shopping the competition’s cart
 Winning bidding strategies
 Knowing what you’re buying
I
f everyone likes a bargain, then I’m not like everyone — I love
bargains! When I was teaching classes at eBay’s own eBay
University (yes, there really is one), my favorite class to teach was
Buying and Browsing, because I love the thrill of the chase and the
acquisition of a good deal without all the haggling.
Often, the first thing that people ask me is how they can stop
getting outbid at the last minute of an auction. I always say the
same thing — become an expert sniper and bid higher than the
other guy!
Okay, but how? In this chapter I give you all my tips — including
a few I picked up from other wise shoppers along the way.
The Secret’s in the Timing
A bricks-and-mortar auction (remember those?), such as those
held by Sotheby’s or Christie’s, ends when the bidding ends. No
auctioneer is going to cut off the bidding for that one-of-a-kind Van
Gogh, right? As long as someone is bidding, all systems are go. The
last bidder standing wins.

But at eBay, things are different. Timing is important. The auctions
at eBay close at a pre-prescribed time. Because of this fundamental
difference in the way eBay runs its auctions, you need to do some
special work to make sure that you can make the most strategically
timed bid possible.
You can find out what time an auction ends by simply looking at
the auction page.
Setting Your Computer
to eBay Time
One of the first things you need to know is that eBay runs on
Pacific Standard Time and that uses a 24-hour clock (it runs in mili-
tary mode — 0:00 to 24:00 versus the more familiar 1:00 to 12:00).
To get the serious deals, you need to synchronize your computer’s
clock with eBay’s. To find out what eBay’s official time is, go to
http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?TimeShow.
When you know eBay’s official time, you need to compare it to
your own computer’s clock. On most Windows-based computers,
the time is in the lower-right corner of the screen on the task bar.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay

Playing “Going, Going, Gone”
Although many people list their auctions to end at all hours of the day and night, it’s
only fair to say that the amount of bidders out in cyberspace is higher during cer-
tain hours. Between the hours of 23:00 (that’s 11 p.m., Pacific Standard Time) and
03:00 (that’s 3 a.m., Pacific Standard Time), things run a bit slowly at eBay. If you’re
online at that time, you may be able to take advantage of some very serious bar-
gains. So swallow a shot of espresso and have fun if you’re a night owl.
Going, Going, Gone is the name of the game my daughter and I used to play when
we wanted to go shopping for fun at eBay. Visit your favorite eBay category and
have fun. (If you’re unfamiliar with categories, skip over to Chapter 11.)
You can choose to view the auctions that are going to end in the next five hours.
This category sorting method is called, not coincidentally, Going, Going, Gone. Here
you can cruise the auction closing while the world is asleep, and bid to your heart’s
content to get some great bargains.

To change the time on your computer’s clock, follow these steps:
1. Open your Internet browser and visit http://cgi3.
ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?TimeShow.
The official clock at the eBay Mother Ship appears, in the
form of the Official Time page. Keep the browser open.
2. Right-click on your computer’s taskbar.
A context menu appears.
3. Select Adjust Date/Time.
The Date/Time Properties window appears.
4. Click the Internet browser to activate it, and then click
the browser’s Refresh button.
The page refreshes.
5. Type the official eBay time into your computer’s clock
and click OK.
Shopping Your Neighbor’s Cart
When you have shopped eBay for a while, you will know the User
IDs of many of the people you bid against in auctions. Don’t be sur-
prised that there are other people in the eBay universe that have
the same quirky interests as you. You may even come to dislike
them if they outbid you often enough. It’s a wretched feeling, being
outbid — especially when it happens at the last minute.
I remember once hearing a comedy routine about how much
quicker it is to shop in a supermarket from other people’s 
carts — and eBay is no different. When you’ve gotten to know
the IDs of your bidding competition, you can run bidder searches
on them.
For example, say oldmeany123 outbids you in an auction for rare
antique glockenspiels, you can run a bidder search on the bidder
and find out what else he or she has been bidding on lately.
You can find out the following information when you run a bidder
search:
 The items the bidder tends to be interested in: Let your 
competition do the legwork of finding the items you like.
Chapter 3: Bargain Shopping Secrets Exposed! 41

 What time of day the bidder likes to make bids: You can get
a sense of whether the bidder is in another part of the country
(or the world) and use the time difference to your advantage.
 Other bidding habits: Some bidders like to place an initial bid
at the beginning of the auction and then swoop in at the end
and snipe. Or they never bid until the end of the auction. Or,
they never snipe. No matter what strategy your competition
chooses, you can come up with a counter strategy to improve
your likelihood of winning.
 How high the bidder tends to like to bid: This is a key to
winning the auction by as few pennies as possible. Does the
bidder end his or her bids with .27? End yours with .32. Also,
if the other bidder is accumulating several similar items one
at a time, you really have a good picture of exactly how much
he or she will bid in this auction. Information is power!
This is not snooping! It’s totally legal and acceptable. When you’ve
checked out your competition’s shopping cart, you can swoop in
and bid or snipe back if you like the other items this bidder is
interested in. Isn’t it easier to let someone else do the legwork and
find the bargains for you?
You can run a bidder search by doing the following:
1. On the eBay Navigation Bar, click Search.
2. Click the By Bidder tab.
3. Enter the User ID of the bidder you want to check out.
4. Click the Search button.
5. To check the bidder’s previous auctions, click in the
Include Completed Items box.
You can see how high the bidder is willing to bid on certain
items. This is invaluable information if you want to get a drift
of how high you have to bid to win the next auction where
you come into competition with your bidding nemesis.
You’ll also see whether the bidder tends to snipe, or likes to bid at
the beginning of the auction. Check the times of day the bidder
likes to place bids; if the bidder is on the East coast and you’re on
the west, you may win some items while he or she is sleeping.
You may find that relying on the bidder search can give you a false
sense of knowledge and confidence. Others may use the bidder
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
42

search to become familiar with your habits, too. And many savvy
buyers have two eBay User IDs and alternate back and forth to
confuse those who try to follow their bidding patterns. Sniping can
help because last-minute bidding doesn’t reveal your hand until it’s
too late for other bidders to respond. No one will know you’re
interested in that giant teddy bear until you win it. Mix your bid-
ding patterns up a bit — keep the competition wondering!
My Favorite Bidding Strategies
There used to be a time when I would tell beginning eBay members
my favorite methods of bidding and winning, and if there was an
eBay employee in earshot, you could see him or her wince as in
pain. Things are considerably different these days.
For example, eBay used to officially oppose the use of third-party
payment options — until eBay purchased PayPal. And sniping.
Don’t get me started. When sniping swept the online auction 
community, the eBay Powers That Be couldn’t endorse the prac-
tice. Finally, after some agonizing, the eBay insiders admit that
sniping does work in winning auctions.
As a matter of fact, eBay’s instructors are now pitching many of
the strategies that I’ve been pitching for years — because they
work! While editing this book, my editor even reminisced about
how much the official eBay party line has changed since we first
worked together in 1999.
Hunting for errors
I have gotten some of my best buys at eBay by searching for mis-
spellings. As a matter of fact, I keep a couple of searches for mis-
spelled items on my own My eBay page. Many sellers are often in
a hurry when they set up their auction listings, and to err is human.
(To win, divine). Of course, there are also a good many sellers who
just don’t pay attention. I am more than willing to forgive sellers
for their mistakes because the payoff for bargain hunters is, well,
a bargain.
Think of alternate spellings when you search for an item. A favorite
of mine is Van Furstenberg for Von Furstenburg (Diane, the designer,
Chapter 3: Bargain Shopping Secrets Exposed! 43

that is). Usually, I search for the correct spelling and find a bunch
of items where the bidding can get steep. But when I search for the
misspelled version of her name, I may find identical items, except
the misspelled items don’t have any bids, because I’m the only one
who has found the listing. 
You can be sure to cover a complete version of your search by
searching using the tricks I outline in Chapter 10, looking for either
word in a search (furstenberg, furstenburg).
I was also very successful during the holiday season of 2002, when
those computer-animated cats were popular (and going for
extremely high prices at eBay, because they were sold out every-
where across the country). The brand name was FurReal. So I
searched for spellings like fur real and furreal. You can find many
bargains by searching for misspelled brand names.
Use asterisks as wild cards in your search, as well, especially if
you’re not sure of the spelling of a word. You can also find some
nuggets when searching for the plural of an item. (Looking for a
truckload of glockenspiels? Tack an s at the end of glockenspiel!)
Check out Chapter 10.
Checking out the high bidder
Take a look at the high bidder in an auction that interests you.
Does he or she have a lot of positive feedback? If he or she does,
you can bet the farm that the bidder knows the ropes and may
jump back in at the last minute with a winning bid.
A little sleuthing can go a long way when trying to beat the compe-
tition for a very special item. Open a bidder’s feedback file and
click the links to the auctions. Read the specific feedback mes-
sages for these auctions to get clues about the bidder’s bidding
style. When you get to the auction, double-click the bidding histo-
ries to get an idea of the time of day that the bidder wins. (If she is
also a seller, you can look at her current and past auctions to get
an idea of her time zone, too.)
Researching your item
Sometimes we (we, that’s me and you) find what we think is an
incredible deal at eBay. It well may be, especially if we know that
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
44

the retail price is, say, $80, and we’re seeing a Buy It Now, or an
auction closing at $40. If a low, low price works for you — just go
ahead and buy the item if you want it right away. To find the best
price for any item at eBay, do your homework to find out what sim-
ilar items at eBay tend to sell for.
When you conduct your eBay research, the best strategy is to look
at the prices achieved in previous sales. Do a search for completed
auctions and check these auctions’ bid history. Click the Bid
History link on the auction item page. (The link appears just next
to the number of bids), and you’ll be presented with the screen
pictured in Figure 3-1.
Quick bidding tips
You can get your tips from many places, but when you get a tip —
double-check who it’s coming from. Visit eBay’s Community boards
and chats, and listen to what the others have to say. Before taking
anything to heart, and changing the way you do things, check the
tip-giver’s experience. Is Miss Busy Body really experienced at
eBay or is she just touting the current company line? Or even pass-
ing on the latest misinformation/gossip on the site? I often say I
love buying from eBay sellers who are also buyers because they
respect and understand what it’s like to be a buyer at eBay!
Figure 3-1: The bidding history lets you know what time bidders
place their bids, and what the highest losing bid was.
Chapter 3: Bargain Shopping Secrets Exposed! 45

Here are a few short tips that I know really work:
 Shop eBay.ca, eh? That’s right. If you’re in the United States,
why not bid on auctions at the eBay Canada Web site? In fact,
if you’re an international bidder, and you’re willing to pay
shipping from the United States, then you’ll have no problem
handling Canadian shipping charges.
If you’re an American resident, all you have to do is think
about the conversion between the U.S. dollar and the
Canadian, and oh, oh yes — there are bargains to be had.
From the eBay home page, scroll down the left side of the
page and click the Canada link. Or you can visit www.eBay.ca.
Be sure the seller has reasonable shipping to the United
States before you bid.
 Place your bids in odd figures. Many eBay bidders place
their bids in the round numbers that match eBay’s proxy
system. You can win by a few cents if you place your bids in
odd numbers like $10.97 or $103.01.
If two people bid the exact same amount at the end of an auc-
tion, the earliest bid (according to eBay’s clock) wins. But if
you and another bidder bid at just about the same time, you
could win by a couple of pennies. I’ve done it many times. For
example, a bid of $23.78 beats a bid of $23.75.
 Don’t get carried away in a bidding war. Unless the item is
extremely rare, odds are that a similar item will show up at
eBay again someday soon. Don’t let your ego get in the way
of smart bidding. Let your opposition pay too much!
 Watch for item re-listings. If you see an item that you want,
but it has too high an opening bid (or too high a reserve) for
you to justify placing a bid, there’s a good chance that no one
else will bid on the item either. Put that auction into your
Watch area of My eBay, and every so often after the auction
ends, double-check the seller’s auctions to see if the seller has
re-listed the item with a lower starting bid and a lower (or no)
reserve.
 Combine shipping when possible. When you purchase an
item, double-check the seller’s other auctions and see whether
you’re interested in making a second purchase. If you see
something else that appeals to you, e-mail the seller to see if
he will combine the items in shipping. That way you can make
two purchases for a smaller single shipping bill. See Chapter
21 for more information about making multiple purchases.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
46

 Never bid early, but if you do, bid high. The only time this
bidding early works is if no one else is interested in the auc-
tion. Usually, though, the tactic will gear up another eBay user
to outbid you because suddenly the item is valuable to at
least one person. If you must bid before the auction’s close,
bid high. As a matter of fact, bid a couple of dollars more than
you might want to pay. (I mean literally a couple, not a couple
hundred.)
 Try for a Second Chance offer. If you get outbid and miss the
chance to increase your bid on an auction item, you’d be
smart to e-mail the seller and ask if he or she has any more.
You may get lucky, and the seller can send you a Second
Chance offer for your high bid.
A seller may send a Second Chance offer to any bidder who
isn’t the winning bidder under two circumstances:
• The winner does not go through with the winning bid.
• The seller has more than one of the item that was sold.
It is eBay-legal to purchase in this way. Any purchase you
make in this manner will be covered under eBay’s insurance,
and you will have the opportunity to leave feedback.
Succeeding by Sniping
Sniping is my number one favorite way to win an auction at eBay.
Sniping is the fine art of outbidding your competition in the very
last seconds of the auction — without leaving them enough time
to place a defensive bid. When I first touted this method in 1999, it
was a fairly new idea. Now everyone knows about sniping, and it’s
pretty much an accepted bidding method.
Bidders (that is, losing bidders) whine and moan when they lose
to a sniper — but there is one thing to remember. eBay uses
proxy bidding. If you’re going to snipe, always assume that the
current bidder has a very high dollar proxy bid in the works. The
high bidder always wins!
Sniping techniques for the beginner
Before you start sniping, be sure you know how fast your Internet
connection will react. Figure out how long it takes to get your bid
Chapter 3: Bargain Shopping Secrets Exposed! 47

confirmed at eBay. Test it a few times until you know how many
seconds you have to spare when placing a bid.
Also be sure you’re signed in first, before you attempt a snipe.
Follow these steps to snipe at the end of the auction:
1. In the last couple of minutes of the auction, locate the
item you want to win and press the Ctrl key and the N
key together to open a second window on your Internet
browser. 
Keep one window open for bidding.
2. Continuously click the Reload or Refresh button in the
browser toolbar.
By reloading the item continually, you’ll be aware when
you’re in the last 60 seconds of bidding. You also can see
instantly whether anyone else is doing any last-minute
bidding.
3. Type your maximum bid in the bid box of the second
browser.
This is the highest amount you will consider paying for
the item.
4. Click the Place Bid button.
When you click the Confirm Bid button that appears on the
next page, your bid is finalized.
5. Do not press the Confirm Bid button yet.
6. Continuously refresh your first browser.
7. As the auction nears its end, confirm your final bid by
clicking the Confirm Bid button.
The longer you can hold off to bid before the auction ends,
the better.
The three-screen approach to sniping
If you really want an item badly enough, try setting up a back-up
sniping setup. Try my three-screen system (see Figure 3-2). With
the triple-screen system, you can place a back-up high bid in case
you catch another sniper swooping in on your item immediately
after your first snipe.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
48

Figure 3-2: My three-browser sniping system in action.
Obviously, if you win with the first snipe — the second window is
unnecessary. But if you lose the first one, that second window feels
like a real life-saver! If you’re outbid after two snipes, don’t cry. The
winner paid way more than you were willing to pay. It’s not much
consolation, but rarely is an item so rare that you only see it come
on the auction block once in a lifetime. You’ll have your chance
again, I promise.
Mechanizing the Sniping Process
My daughter says that I can make almost anything I do high main-
tenance, and that very well may be true. When it comes to eBay
bidding and winning, there are a bunch of software programs and
Web sites that can help automate your shopping and feedback
process.
Auto-sniping your auctions
There are many reasons for not wanting to snipe your own auc-
tions. You might not have the time to be there for the closing of
Chapter 3: Bargain Shopping Secrets Exposed! 49

each one, you may have a slow Internet connection, or you may
just not want to bother. All are very valid reasons!
There are many companies out there who can help you in your
sniping needs. Just remember that if you use software downloaded
to your computer, your computer has to be online at the time of
the auction.
Here are a few that I have used both of these programs successfully:
 BidRobot: BidRobot, shown in Figure 3-3, deftly places sniping
bids for you from its servers. I admit to using BidRobot, and
it’s won many an auction for me while I’ve been on the road or
busy writing. The service is one of the least expensive ones
out there. It charges a low flat rate for all the snipes you could
use. Get a free trial at www.bidrobot.com. Just enter the code
cool in the registration box.
 eSnipe: Another very popular sniping server is eSnipe, shown
in Figure 3-4. This service charges a fee of approximately 1
percent of the final winning price, with a maximum of $10 (you
pay only if you win). You can purchase Bid Points to place in
your account to pay for upcoming snipes. For 14 days of free
sniping, use this link www.esnipe.com/marshacollier.
Figure 3-3: Easily place snipes in advance by using the BidRobot Web site.

50

Figure 3-4: A snipe ready to go at eSnipe.
Bidder’s research software
Research software is the kind of software that is going to help you
dig deep into a seller’s feedback or check out a competitive bidder.
Most software out there is for sellers, but you can find a couple of
programs strictly for buyers. If you plan on spending any serious
money at eBay, using a feedback evaluation software program
might be worth the cost. Here is what’s out there:
 BayCheck Pro: With this software, you can find out all about
another eBay user. You can see his or her selling and bidding
history, feedback received (isolating the neutrals and nega-
tives to read without going through all the seller’s e-mail) and
the feedback the user has left for others. For a special free
trial and a discount price of $14.99 for the software go to www.
hammertap.com/coolebaytools/bargainhunter.html.
 Safe2Bid: This simple little program explores the feedback of
any particular eBay user. It also separates the negatives and
neutrals and works the percentages for you. More information
is available at www.cricketsniper.com.
Chapter 3: Bargain Shopping Secrets Exposed! 51

Knowing What You’re Buying
Be sure that you know the actual street price of an item before you
place a bid. The street price is the price that people actually pay —
not the MSRP (manufacturer’s suggested retail price).
You may be comfortable paying slightly more than the street price
because eBay is so easy to use — after all, the item is delivered to
your door, and you don’t have to go to a bricks-and-mortar store to
shop for the item. But it’s good to know how much you can get the
item for so you don’t bid too much.
You can use the Internet to check prices for many items. In fact,
several consumer Web sites are dedicated to serving savvy con-
sumers by offering this information.
You can find computer item pricing at www.pricewatch.com.
Prices for almost everything else can be found at a new site from
Google, www.froogle.com.

wide search tools for all types of items on the Internet.

Discovering Your My
eBay Page
In This Chapter
 Watching, bidding and winning
 Storing your favorites
 Visiting feedback central
 Setting your preferences
O
ne of the super tools that eBay gives all its users is the My
eBay page. I call it a page, but it’s really an area — a group of
several pages tagged together with tabs. The My eBay page gives
you complete control of everything you are doing (or would like to
do) at eBay. For example, sellers use this page to keep track of
sales.
In this chapter, I show you how to take this tool and personalize it
to keep all your eBay shopping organized — you can even make
note of how much you spend (so you can stay within your shop-
ping budget).
You can find a link to your My eBay pages immediately when you
go to the eBay site. It is available from the top of the eBay Web
page Navigation Bar, by clicking the link that points to My eBay.
If you haven’t signed in, you can access your My eBay page by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. On the top of any eBay page, click the My eBay link
above the Navigation Bar.
You’re sent to the My eBay sign in page.

2. Type your User ID and password.
You can type in your registered e-mail address or your
eBay User ID. Your User ID and e-mail address are inter-
changeable on the site.
3. Alternatively, you can sign in with Microsoft Passport.
If you sign in with Passport, you go directly to your My
eBay.
If you ever forget your eBay password, go to http://pages.
ebay.com/services/registration/reqpass.html. If you
remember the answer to the question you were asked during
the eBay registration process, you can create a new password
immediately. (For registration information, see Chapter 1.)
4. Click the Sign In button.
When you arrive at the target page (see Figure 4-1), you’re
presented with a page of links. You can choose
Figure 4-1: Signed in and ready to shop.
• The My eBay Preferences tab: In this area, you can cus-
tomize how eBay will work for you based on your per-
sonal preferences. Keep reading this chapter for help on

• Item I Last Looked At: If you were looking at an item at
eBay, and realized you weren’t signed, this link takes you
back to that item.
• My eBay: Click this link to catch up on your eBay shop-
ping. (See Figure 4-2.)

All these options in one (very long) scrollable page.
You may change the order in which these items appear on the page
by clicking the up or down arrows in the right-hand corner of the
boxes. Click the up arrow once, and the selected box moves up one
space on the page. Click the down arrow, and the box will move
down one space.
Watching, Bidding, and Winning
The Bidding/Watching tab of the My eBay page helps you keep con-
trol of everything you’re currently shopping for on the site. This is
the page I check several times a day to see the progress of items
I’m interested in.
This tab can be very handy because you can monitor the best
deals and bargains that are closing within the next few hours. You
can even set the downloadable eBay Toolbar so that an alarm goes
off a few minutes before one of the auctions you’re watching ends.
See Chapter 3 for more on how to set-up this automated system.
Keeping track of items you’ve bid on
Every time you bid on an item at eBay, a record of your bidding
action is posted in the Items I’m Bidding On area of your My eBay
page (see Figure 4-3).
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
56

Figure 4-3: Items I’m bidding on.
In fact, the Items I’m Bidding On area displays a clickable link to
the item; the amount of your maximum bid, the current price, the
auction’s end date (as well as a counter style Time Left column). If
you are the leading bidder, your price appears in green, and if
you’re not, it appears in red. (If you’re participating in a Dutch auc-
tion, your current bid isn’t color coded.)
The dollar values for all your active bids are totaled automatically
at the bottom of the Items I’m Bidding On area. This is an invalu-
able tool so that you can know just how much you’re spending at
one time or another.
Watching the progress of the auction from here can be very strate-
gic. You can observe how much bidding action there is on an item
before you decide to jump back in and bid again. If an item’s price
is getting too high for your liking, you might just want to search
eBay for another one of the item so that you can get in on a bargain
instead.
Counting the items you’ve won
After you win an item, the information you need automatically goes
to the Items I’ve Won area of the My eBay page, shown in Figure 4-4.
From here, you can pay for the item via PayPal (or see if your
payment has already gone through) and go back to the auction 
Chapter 4: Discovering Your My eBay Page 57

Figure 4-4: Counting my goodies in the Items I’ve Won area.
item page to print it out. You also can check out from here (if you
haven’t paid). But wait, there’s more. There’s also a link that allows
you to leave feedback for the seller once you’ve received your item.
You can change the number of days you’d like to see reflected (up
to 30 days) in the chart below. Notice that there is a box with a
small push-pin icon with the words Save This Setting. Click in the
box if you want the My eBay page to remember the number of days
you’ve input that you want as your default. eBay’s basic default for
the display is two days.
Watching the items you want
Your Bidding/Watching page has an area where you can watch
some items. From this area you can observe the bidding action
on items that interest you without showing your hand to the
competition — that you’re interested in the item. You can see the
number of bids that were placed on the item and see how fast
the price is rising (or not).
You have a limited number of items that you can watch — just 30
and then eBay cuts you off. Silly eBay would rather have you bid on
items rather than watch them!
When you’ve found an auction that you want to keep track of, look
for the teeny pair of binoculars in the right column at the top of
the auction. That’s the Watch This Item link. Click the link, and the
item listing becomes active in your Items I’m Watching area.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
58

At the bottom of the My eBay page is a group of links that can take
you to related areas at eBay. Before you freak out because you
have a question about something at eBay, double-check the bottom
of the page. These links link to eBay’s basic help information.
Knowing the items you lost
The My eBay page has a section letting you know when you’ve
been outbid and lost an item, as shown in Figure 4-5. This option
isn’t there just to rub your nose in all the auctions you’ve lost —
it’s actually a very handy tool that lets you search the seller’s
items for a similar item, or search the category for a similar item
with a click of the mouse.
Figure 4-5: Items I (sniff) didn’t win.
Keeping Track of Your Favorites
The best part of cruising eBay for bargains is finding items you
never knew you wanted or needed. (I just saw a great deal on a
1950s candy dish — who’d have guessed that I needed it?) People
have so many varied interests that the Favorites page is the
perfect way to keep up with the many things you want to look
for regularly.
You can list 4 of your favorite categories for browsing, 15 of your
favorite searches and 15 of your favorite sellers (or eBay stores).
Chapter 4: Discovering Your My eBay Page 59

By listing your favorites, you can build your own personal eBay
mall, populated with only the types of items you’re interested in.
Setting up your favorite searches
There may be certain things that you are always looking for at
eBay. Say you plan to search frequently for a Callaway Seven
Heaven Wood — whatever — add it to your list of favorite searches
(see Figure 4-6), and you won’t have to retype Callaway Seven
Heaven Wood more than once. (Now there’s a blessing!) By organiz-
ing your favorite searches, you can search for your favorite items
with a click of your mouse on the Search Now link.
Be sure to use all the search trick shortcuts I show you in the table
in Chapter 10 because these searches are not performed in the
search box. These are single-line searches that you normally would
perform from the small search boxes on the eBay pages.
Figure 4-6: My favorite searches.
To set up a favorite search, follow these steps:
1. Click the Add New Search link on the Favorites page.
The eBay Search page appears.
2. Type your key search words and perform your search.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
60

3. When the results come up, scroll to the bottom of the
page and click the Save This Search link.
You can select three of your favorite searches to be
e-mailed to you daily (or whenever new items appear). For
example, there are some lesser-known artists who I like;
I’ve set up my favorite searches so that I’ll get an e-mail
message whenever one of the artist’s items shows up for
sale at eBay.
Choosing your favorite categories
The Favorite categories area has got to be eBay’s cruel joke. For
some reason, you’re only allowed to select four categories on your
Favorites page! Certainly that’s not enough for an inveterate shop-
per! But four it is, and you must select your four. Click the link on
the top-right of this box to change or set your categories through
eBay’s drop-down boxes.
To set up your favorite categories, follow these steps:
1. Select the main category you’re interested in.
If the category is divided into subcategories, an arrow
appears at the end of the category name.
2. Click the subcategory you’re interested in.
If you see another arrow, yet another subcategory box
opens.
3. Click the subcategory that you like.
And so on, until you reach a category that doesn’t end in
an arrow. 
You must perform this clickfest four times so that you can
select all four categories (see Figure 4-7).
If you want to link to fewer than four categories, just select as
many as you want to monitor, then click Submit. Only the cate-
gories you selected are listed.
You can’t choose a big category — you have to choose a
subcategory.
Chapter 4: Discovering Your My eBay Page 61

Figure 4-7: Selecting your favorite categories.
The items at eBay are all organized in a cornucopia of categories
(see Chapter 2 for more information). If you click a category, you
see a category number. If you know the number of your favorite
category, you can just type it into the category number box when
you set up your favorite categories, and not go through the drop-
down menu selection process.
When you’ve gone through the process and selected your four cat-
egories, your favorite categories area will look like the one in
Figure 4-8.
Figure 4-8: My favorite categories (this week).
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
62

To browse your favorite categories, you have to select one of the
four links offered:
 Current: By clicking on this link you’ll see every item cur-
rently being auctioned in the category, with the most recent
listings shown first.
With this search, you may end up with thousands of items to
wade through.
 New Today: This option shows all items put up for sale within
the prior 24 hours, with the newest listings shown first.
 Ending Today: Shows you every auction that is closing within
the next 24 hours, in the order of ending time. The ending
time is printed in red if the auction closes within five hours,
and those ending first are shown first.
A more efficient search, especially in a category with tens of
thousands of items, would be in the New Today or Ending
Today link. These links trim the number of listed items to a
controllable number.
 Going, Going, Gone: Shows auctions in this category that are
ending in the next five hours. This link offers a fun way to find
items you can snipe. (See Chapter 3 for the lowdown on the
fine art of getting bargains through sniping.)
Choosing your favorite
sellers and stores
When you’ve been shopping eBay for awhile, you will find that cer-
tain sellers carry a type of merchandise that interests you. By
saving their User IDs in this area, you’ll be able to revisit their cur-
rent auctions without having to run a seller search from the search
area. (See Chapter 10 for more details on searches.) 
The purpose of the My eBay page is to have all your controls in
one area. Figure 4-9 shows a favorite sellers area.
You may add a new seller by clicking the Add New Seller/Store link
in the upper-right corner of the box.
Chapter 4: Discovering Your My eBay Page 63

Figure 4-9: Your My eBay Favorite Sellers area.
Feedback Central
In Chapter 5, I talk all about the importance of feedback to the
eBay community. In the Feedback area of the My eBay page (see
Figure 4-10), you can keep track of all your feedback duties.
When you click the Feedback tab, you can see your current eBay
User ID card on the right, and on the left is an area that directs you
on how to leave feedback to other eBay members.
Figure 4-10: The Feedback tab on the My eBay page.
Part I: Opening Up the Bargain-Filled World of eBay 
64

The Leaving Feedback Links area gives you an all-in-one place to a
link to all feedback duties. Here you can find places to
 Find all item listings from the last 90 days that you haven’t left
feedback for. (For shame!)
 Review and respond to feedback left for you. Responding to
feedback is especially important, especially if the feedback is
less than stellar. (Every story has two sides.)
 See all Feedback you have left for others. If you want to re-
examine feedback that you’ve left, this is the place.
Below these boxes is a listing of all your feedback dating back to
your first transaction at eBay.
Setting Your eBay Preferences
Visit the Preferences tab to change the way eBay reacts to your
sign in information. You can set eBay to require your password
every time you bid or perform eBay tasks or not. It’s up to you. You
can also set up your viewing preferences, like how many items
come up on one page when you perform a search.
But the most important part of this area is the important links at
the bottom of the page. These links lead you to locations where
you can change your e-mail address (without losing your feed-
back), change your User ID, or change your password. There’s also
a link to change your home address on record.
Keeping all your contact information up-to-date at eBay is very
important. If eBay ever finds that any of the contact information is
wrong, you may have your membership suspended.
You also see a link that allows you to input your text messaging
number for your mobile phone. That way, eBay can notify you on
your mobile phone when you get outbid in an auction and when
you win an item (if your mobile service offers this option, of
course). (Select these options by clicking the Change My
Notification Preferences link.)

Chapter 5
Feedback: The Heart
of Safe Trading
In This Chapter
 Understanding feedback basics
 Scrutinizing a seller’s reputation
 Doling out feedback responsibly
O
ne of eBay’s strong suits has been the formation of a sense of
community through its use of message boards, topical chats,
and feedback. Many experts say the reason that eBay has suc-
ceeded where dozens of other dot com auction sites have failed is
that eBay has always paid close attention to the needs of its users.
In its first few months of existence, the fledgling eBay (then called
Auction Web) was marred with a few simple misunderstandings
between some buyers and sellers. If an item arrived damaged or a
little too late, for example, buyers would jump to conclusions and
complain to eBay about sellers. And sellers had plenty of com-
plaints, as well, especially about payments.
It soon became clear to eBay’s three employees that they did not
have time to adjudicate member disputes. And thus, the feedback
system was born. I discuss the feedback system in this chapter.
Self-Policing: The eBay Way
Even in the early days, the concept was clear. Pierre and his
employees figured that if users complained openly (for all other
members to see), feedback would be more genuine — not so much
flaming as constructive. The “do unto others” philosophy prevailed,

and above all else, Pierre tried to encourage buyers and sellers to
give each other the benefit of the doubt and to conduct themselves
professionally. But the piece de resistance of the feedback policy,
the part that really makes eBay work, is the fact that Pierre and his
staff encouraged users to give positive feedback as often as they
give negative or neutral feedback.
The benefits of the feedback policy are immediately clear. Before
even placing a bid, a buyer (that’s you) can check on the experi-
ence other eBay buyers have had doing business with this seller.
For example, you can see whether
 Items in a seller’s previous auctions shipped quickly.
 Items were packed carefully.
 Communication was clear and frequent.
You can have more information about an eBay seller in two min-
utes than you have when you walk into a new store in your own
neighborhood.
Every eBay member has a feedback rating. Buyers rate sellers; sell-
ers rate buyers — no one is immune. A seller might comment on
how quickly you pay for an item, and how well you communicated
or how you reacted to a problem.
Introducing your feedback rating
After every member’s User ID there is a number. This number is a
net figure of the positive comments that were left for that eBay
user. What that means is if you get 50 positive comments and 49
negative comments, your feedback rating is 1.
For every positive comment you receive, you get a plus one (+1).
For every negative comment, you get a minus one (-1). Theoreti-
cally, if you play nice, your feedback rating grows as you spend
more time buying (and selling) at eBay.
The number, as it grows, shows not only how good a customer
(and seller, if you go that route) you are, but also how experienced
you are at doing business on the site. If your rating sinks to nega-
tive four (-4), you’re suspended from using the eBay system.
Forever.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
70

You may also get a neutral comment. A neutral comment is neither
negative nor positive and doesn’t change the number that appears
after your User ID. Neutral comments are used most often when
someone is not completely happy with a transaction, but not so
unhappy that he or she chooses to destroy someone else’s reputa-
tion over the situation.
Getting your star
When you first join eBay, it seems like everyone at eBay has a star
except for you. It’s so unfair isn’t it? Well, not really. The stars of
many colors are awarded based on the amount of positive feed-
back that you have. When you receive a feedback rating of 10, you
will get a gold star (just like in school).
You may notice stars of other colors — even shooting stars; Table 5-1
gives you the lowdown on what each star color represents.
Table 5-1
Star Colors and Your Feedback Rating

50,000 to 99,999

100,000 and higher
When you reach a higher level, I assure you that you will get a silly
tingly feeling of accomplishment. It’s all part of being a member of
the eBay community.
Chapter 5: Feedback: The Heart of Safe Trading 71

Scrutinizing a Seller’s Reputation
You’ve finally found an item you’d like to buy. Don’t place that bid
just yet! Studying the seller’s feedback will supply you with a good
deal of information about the reputation of your potential trading
partner.
The more expensive your transaction, the more intense your inves-
tigation may need to be. An unblemished feedback rating may not
be as significant on a $9 purchase as it is for a $200 purchase.
I want you to be thoroughly educated in how the feedback system
works. I’m not trying to be bossy. I’m just saying that buyers and
sellers (especially those of us who have been using eBay for sev-
eral years) take this stuff very seriously.
Still, if you’re just a dabbler, I can understand why you might want
to learn the light version of the eBay feedback system and save the
high-octane rendition of a feedback investigation for when you
decide to buy a yacht, or the British Crown Jewels.
Conducting light seller scrutiny
As you look at the items for sale at eBay (both in auctions and in
fixed-price sales), you’ll notice that along with every auction listing
you can find information about the seller. This is eBay’s Seller
Information box. (Figure 5-1 shows you a composite of three
unique Seller Information boxes.)
Figure 5-1: Seller Information boxes from three different sellers, 
including me.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
72

Consider a quick glance at the Seller Information box to be the
light version of a feedback investigation. If your potential purchase
is for an item that’s worth a few dollars to you, and the Seller
Information box shows a 99-100 percent positive feedback percent-
age, as in the first example in Figure 5-1, you’re probably safe.
However, if the Seller Information box looks closer to the second
example, and you’re looking at a pricier item, it’s time for a more
thorough analysis.
The Seller Information box gives you a condensed version of the
seller’s feedback reputation. It always includes the seller’s User ID
and feedback rating, including his or her star award level. But the
Seller Information box also contains some other important infor-
mation, including the following:
 Whether the seller is a Power Seller (I discuss Power Selling in
Chapter 6).
 Whether the seller has an About Me page (see more about the
About Me page later in this chapter).
 Whether the seller has an eBay Store (see Chapter16 for
details). If so, a small price tag appears.
 A pair of sunglasses (known as shades in the eBay vernacular)
to show if the user is new or has changed his or her User ID in
the past 30 days.
 The seller’s positive feedback percentage. This percentage is
calculated by dividing the total of the seller’s unique positive
feedback comments by the total of the unique positive and
negative feedback comments (see “Getting a comprehensive
sense of a seller’s feedback” for more on how eBay defines
unique positive feedback comments).
 How long the seller has been a member of the eBay community.
 The seller’s home country.
 Links to read the seller’s feedback reviews, to view his or her
other auctions (see Chapter 3 for why this is an important
link), ask the seller a question (see Chapter 2), and a Safe
Trading Tips link.
Even though the seller in the second example has an overall higher
feedback rating, the percentage of positive comments is a little
lower, and suggests further examination.
Chapter 5: Feedback: The Heart of Safe Trading 73

Checking the seller’s About Me page
If you notice that Joe Seller has a small Me icon next to his or her
User ID, click the icon to learn more about him.
Every eBay member may have his or her own home page at eBay
called the About Me page (you can have one, too). The About Me
page is where members talk about themselves, their businesses,
and their collections. (You can find my About Me page at: http://
members.ebay.com/aboutme/marsha_c).
I came across the About Me page shown in Figure 5-2 when I was
looking at an auction for a Limoge plate. This page is a great exam-
ple of how eBay members show their personalities and build trust-
worthy person-to-person (rather than computer-to-computer)
relationships with other members of the eBay community.
If a new seller (without a lot of feedback) smartly puts up an About
Me page and talks about his or her eBay goals and business, you
may feel more comfortable about doing business with the seller.
Figure 5-2: An example About Me page.

Getting a comprehensive sense
of a seller’s feedback
When you consider buying a more expensive item, be sure to click
the seller’s feedback number when you visit the auction item page.
Clicking on the number shows you the member’s feedback sum-
mary and ID card, shown in Figure 5-3.
After you click the feedback number, there are several things you
should examine if you’re a savvy, security-minded shopper.
Figure 5-3: Member feedback summary and ID card.
Feedback summary
On the left side of the page you see the feedback summary and on
the right, the seller’s ID card. Here there are significant things to
note:
 Positive feedback comments: You may notice that the actual
number of positive comments is higher then the net positive
figure. This is because every eBay community member can
comment about another member as often as he or she wants,
but the comment only counts once in the feedback rating. The
rating is called a net rating because it’s based on comments
from unique users.
For example, if you buy an item from me, and we leave each
other feedback (glowingly positive, I’m sure), and then next
month I buy something from you, the feedback we leave on
Chapter 5: Feedback: The Heart of Safe Trading 75

the second transaction (again, glowingly positive) doesn’t
count toward our total feedback rating. However, the feedback
does appear on the feedback summary page. You can only
affect each other’s feedback rating by 1.
 Neutral comments: Neutral comments are usually left when 
a party wasn’t thrilled with the transaction, but nothing 
happened that was really bad enough to leave a dreaded, 
reputation-ruining negative comment. You may also notice
that some long-time eBay users have neutral comments that
were converted from users no longer registered.
For a very short while eBay had a policy that when a member
was suspended (yes, members do get suspended) or the
member chose to cancel his or her eBay membership, eBay
turned all the feedback it member ever left or received
(whether it was positive or negative) into neutral feedback.
This policy didn’t last for very long because the eBay mem-
bers put up such a fuss that the eBay Powers That Be listened
and stopped the practice. Unfortunately, eBay didn’t rescind
the neutrals that had been put into place.
 Negative comments: The number of negative comments may
also vary, just like the positives, because only one comment
is allowed per “unique user.” (Information on when to leave
what kind of feedback appears later in this chapter.)
Member ID card
On the right side of this comprehensive feedback is the eBay
Member ID card, which carries historic information about the
member:
 Identification information: Click the User ID to see an e-mail
form so that you can send an e-mail to the member through
eBay’s e-mail system.
 Summary of most recent reviews: In a snapshot, you can see
the seller’s recent eBay history for the past week, month, and
six-month period. This data is very useful because often the
last couple of month’s transactions tell the tale. If a previously
reliable eBay seller has decided to join the Dark Side, this is
where the evidence shows up first. New negative comments
from different buyers are signs of danger, even if the seller has
an overall high rating.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
76

If the last few transactions are negative in the recent reviews,
think twice about doing business with the seller, but that
doesn’t mean that you should count the seller out completely.
If the item is really a must-have, click the ID of the person (or
persons) who left the negative feedback, and ask politely for
details so that you can make your own decisions. Sadly, many
buyers leave negative feedback for a seller before giving the
seller an opportunity to make things right, so by getting the
details you can make your own decisions.
 Bid retractions: A history of bidding on items and then chang-
ing one’s mind is a signal more for a seller to note than a
buyer. As a buyer, you may, under certain circumstances,
retract your bid (see Chapter 2). Each time you retract your
bid from an auction, the retraction shows up in this area.
Sellers often check this area to determine a bidder’s reliability.
 Member links: In this location, you can find links that can give
you more information about the member, such as links to the
member’s eBay Store, (if the seller has one, of course), his or
her other auctions (where you can see if the seller is experi-
enced in selling the type of item you are looking to buy), his
or her ID history (where you can view the seller’s past User
IDs, if any) and feedback the seller may have left about others.
Checking the type of feedback someone leaves about others can
give you a real insight into his or her personality. When consider-
ing making a big purchase, I always check this area; it really helps
me know the type of person I’m dealing with.
When you read feedback that makes nasty slams at the other
person, or if the person uses rude words or phrases when leaving
feedback, you may be dealing with a loose cannon.
Reading feedback reviews
Scrolling down the feedback history page, you’ll be able to read
the actual reviews left by other eBay members. In Figure 5-4, you’ll
see a sample of my current feedback. You see each the member’s
User ID, along with his or her feedback and comment. 
Chapter 5: Feedback: The Heart of Safe Trading 77

Figure 5-4: Feedback review page.
Here’s what else you see:
 The date the feedback was left, along with a clickable link to
the transaction. You can click the link to the item, as long as it
was for a relatively recent transaction (items generally remain
in the eBay database for about 90 days).
 Either see an S or a B on the far right side of each comment.
S stands for the seller in the transaction, and B stands for the
buyer.
Many independent eBay sellers are experienced buyers as
well as sellers — they have an excellent grasp of how eBay
feels from a customer’s point of view and expertly know how
to handle any of your concerns.
Here are some tips for assessing feedback, depending on the
situation:
 When buying from a seller that sells the same item repeti-
tively, use the clickable links to the past transactions to check
if other buyers were pleased with their purchases.
 When you come across neutral or negative feedback, as
shown in Figure 5-5, look for the seller’s response. A seller or
a buyer may respond to the feedback by clicking the Respond
to Comments link (refer to Figure 5-4).
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
78

The feedback system relies on the expectation that members
give each other the benefit of the doubt. When you come
across negative (or neutral) feedback about a seller, look for
the seller’s response and see whether the problem was
resolved before making your final judgment. You may even see
a follow-up feedback comment from the buyer saying that
everything has been settled.
At eBay, feedback cannot be removed, unless both parties go
through mediation (see Chapter 6).
Figure 5-5: A seller’s response to feedback.
Leaving Responsible Feedback
Almost any eBay seller will tell you that one of his or her pet
peeves about the eBay feedback system is that new community
members tend to leave neutral, or, even worse, negative feedback
the moment a shipment arrives and something is wrong.
Here’s what you need to know to avoid getting a bad rap for being
too hard on sellers.
Missing or damaged shipments
When the package leaves the seller’s hands, it is literally (and com-
pletely) out of his hands. If UPS, Federal Express Ground, or
Federal Express Air ships your package, the tracking number can
track the item. Tracking offered by the U.S. Post Office can be
casual (at best), and is often not scanned until the package is deliv-
ered to your door, thus negating the trackability (for lack of a
better term) of the package. Here are a few things to remember:
 Be sure you know when the seller plans to ship the merchan-
dise, so there is less question about when it will probably
arrive. If this information isn’t stated in the auction descrip-
tion, use the Ask the Seller a Question link to find out before
you buy to see if the shipping schedule matches your needs.
Chapter 5: Feedback: The Heart of Safe Trading 79

 If you do not pay the seller extra money to purchase insur-
ance before your item is shipped, it is unfair to hold the
seller responsible for damaged or lost shipments. Period.
End of story.
 Open your packages immediately upon receipt. A seller
can’t make a claim on an item that you report damaged in
shipping a month after it arrives, so leaving negative feedback
at that point is unfair. Most shippers insist that any and all
damage must be reported within five days of receipt. Also, if
damage has occurred, keep all packing materials for inspec-
tion by the carrier. If you fail to save these materials, the car-
rier may not accept your claim, and you will have no further
recourse.
 There is not much that a seller can do about a missing 
package. Sellers can’t even make a claim on a postal
shipment until 30 days have passed since mailing.
 If the item never arrives, only the sender can file a claim
with the shipping company and must produce all shipping
receipts. It’s only fair to notify the seller immediately upon
receiving a damaged shipment, either by e-mail or telephone.
Leaving negative feedback before contacting the seller to help
you make the claim is just plain unjust.
You shouldn’t notify the seller of conditions using feedback.
Use e-mail.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
80
USPS information you can use
To file a claim with the U.S. Postal Service, visit the USPS Web site (http://pe.
usps.gov/text/dmm/s010.htm#Rgf16915).
Only the sender can file a claim for the complete loss of a registered, insured, COD,
or Express Mail item (including merchandise return service parcels to which
special.
Either the sender of the recipient can file a claim for damage or if some or all of the
contents of an article are missing.

Item doesn’t meet your expectations
If the item arrives and it isn’t as described in the item description,
e-mail the seller. Communication is a good thing. Give the seller the
opportunity to work things out with you. 
Most sellers feel that customers are important (essential!) to their
eBay business and want to preserve their reputation. If you don’t
give a seller a chance, he or she can’t make things right. Keep in
mind these facts:
 If an item arrives damaged and is brand new and sent in the
manufacturer’s sealed box, the damage could have happened
at the manufacturer, and the seller might never have known
about it.
 A seller may not be as experienced in a particular area of 
collecting as you are. If you didn’t ask all the necessary 
questions before bidding, you may have just gotten what the
seller assumed was a collectible. It’s up to the buyer to ask
questions before placing a bid at eBay — which is a legally
binding contract to purchase.
 Don’t jump to leave negative feedback if you receive the
wrong item. The seller might have mixed up the labels during
shipping. Just notify the seller. He or she will no doubt work
out the mistake with you.
Most importantly, the seller should be given the chance to prove
he or she cares. If you can’t come to terms with the seller, try con-
tacting SquareTrade (see Chapter 6) for online dispute resolution.
If you feel you’re a victim of fraud, you can apply for eBay’s fraud
insurance (see Chapter 7).
Leaving Feedback
Remember that feedback cannot be retracted. You are responsible
for your words. They will remain on the eBay site forever with your
User ID next to them for all to see. Be sure to leave a simple, fac-
tual, and unemotional statement. 
Chapter 5: Feedback: The Heart of Safe Trading 81

Important things to mention in your feedback are
 How satisfied you were with your purchase
 The quality of the packaging
 The promptness of shipping
 The seller’s professionalism
 The level of communication
If you must leave a negative feedback comment, know that you will
probably get one in return because if you couldn’t resolve things
without a problem, chances are the seller wasn’t very happy with
the trading experience either. Try to work things out first!

I
am a big proponent of taking responsibility for my own actions.
When I mess up, I admit it (only to myself, of course, and then
I immediately destroy all evidence of the debacle) and try not to
make that same mistake again. 
Maybe one reason I like eBay so much is because its sense of
community revolves around the concept of personal responsibility
(check out Chapter 5 for more information). So, what I’m about
to tell you shouldn’t be too surprising: You are responsible for
your actions when you shop online. Be careful. Remember all the
caveats I mention in this book. The feedback information in
Chapter 5 is important, but not more so than the information
I give you in this chapter.
As in life, if a deal at eBay looks too good to be true, it very well
may be!
In this chapter, I show you a few solid things to consider in your
eBay dealings.

First Warnings That Something’s
Not Right
Although feedback is your number one tool for assessing the legiti-
macy of a seller before you place a bid, the following information is
essential for your protection, as well. Think twice if you see these
items when you’re shopping:
 Pre-sale listings: eBay permits sellers to list items for sale
that are not currently in their possession, provided that the
seller guarantees that the item can be shipped within 30 days
from the end of the listing. However, the seller must state that
the item is a pre-sale.
Unless you really, really need the item, or the seller has really
outstanding feedback, 30 days is a long time to be without
your money or an item — and it is no guarantee that the item
will ever arrive. Before you bid, click the Ask the Seller a
Question link to get a firm shipping date from the seller. If you
can’t get a hold of the seller, take it as a sign to move on. By
the way, if you intend to pay for a pre-sale item using PayPal,
take note — allows sellers only 20 days advance payment.
 An impossible-to-find item: Double-check a seller’s feedback,
if he or she is selling large quantities of hard-to-find items,
especially during the holidays when the hot ticket is an item
that’s selling for double or triple the suggested retail price.
People tend to throw caution to the wind when they see an
item they want desperately that’s sold out everywhere else in
the known universe. Read the seller’s feedback to see if
people who have ordered this item in recent auctions have
actually received the item.
 Professional photos: Is the seller using the same photos in
multiple auctions? Does the photo look like it has been taken
from the manufacturer’s Web site? A computer-savvy person
can easily take a picture from the manufacturer and claim it as
his or her own. The more a photograph looks as if it was taken
by the seller, the better the chance that the seller actually has
the item.
 E-mail solicitations: You may receive solicitations from sellers
offering to sell you an item you recently bid on for a lower
price. Although the seller may be earnest, you will not be pro-
tected by eBay in any transaction that doesn’t happen on the
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
84

eBay site. In other words, just because you’re doing business
with an eBay member doesn’t mean you’re doing a transac-
tion at eBay. The fact is that hucksters will do anything they
can to get around eBay’s policies.
Using ID Verify
ID Verify is a tool that is available to both buyers and sellers.
Members who are new to the site, and members who choose not to
provide credit card information when registering to become eBay
sellers, tend to use it most frequently.
The ID Verify icon (shown in Figure 6-1) appears next to an eBay
member’s User ID if he or she has applied for, and passed the veri-
fication process.
The process is simple, and it allows new users of eBay to show
other members that they are earnest in their desire to become a
responsible member of the community. It means that your identifi-
cation has been verified by the trusted organization, VeriSign.
Figure 6-1: The ID Verify icon.
If you’re thinking about bidding in a new seller’s auction (one that
has little or low feedback — but, so far, all positive), the ID Verify
icon shows that the seller has put some serious effort into estab-
lishing credibility. At least you know right off the bat that members
who use ID Verify are who they say they are.
You might also like to use ID Verify, as well. There are benefits for
buyers as well. Again, if you didn’t provide a credit card number
when you became a registered eBay member, ID Verify allows
you to
 Bid on items at Sothebys.com through the eBay site
 Bid above $15,000 (lucky you!)
 Access the Mature Audiences Category
Chapter 6: Shopping Safely 85

If you want these benefits, the cost is $5, and you’ll be asked per-
sonal information such as your name, date of birth, social security
number or driver’s license number, and to identify credit card
account information. Your ID Verify icon is valid until your home
address or phone number changes. You submit all information
using an encrypted, secure connection.
Introducing SquareTrade
Many sellers who are serious about their eBay business apply for a
SquareTrade seal. SquareTrade was founded in 1999 to provide a
way for online traders to ensure safer online transactions. To date,
SquareTrade has resolved over 100,000 disputes, totaling $50 mil-
lion in transactions. SquareTrade provides several services to the
eBay community.
The SquareTrade seal program
Sellers who meet SquareTrade’s stringent standards may subscribe
to the SquareTrade seal (see Figure 6-2) and display it (proudly) in
their auctions. A SquareTrade-reviewed seller meets the following
criteria:
 Identity verification: SquareTrade has verified the seller’s
identity, contact information, or both the identity and the con-
tact information.
 Mediation commitment: Should the need arise, the seal certi-
fies that the seller agrees to enter mediation to resolve trans-
action-related issues, as well as to abide by any agreements
that are the result of mediation processes.
 Fraud protection: By displaying the seal, the seller may be
demonstrating that an additional layer of fraud protection
(above and beyond that offered by eBay) is available for pur-
chases. The additional fraud protection goes $200 over that
offered by eBay’s policy.
 Selling standards: To be sealed SquareTrade members, sell-
ers must explicitly define their selling policies and maintain
high customer service standards.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
86

Figure 6-2: The SquareTrade seal is updated daily with 
a check on the seller’s reputation.
Online dispute resolution
If you have a problem in a transaction, you may file your case with
SquareTrade. SquareTrade will contact the other party, and the
two of you may attempt to work things out through SquareTrade’s
automated, Web-based direct negotiation tool. The negotiation is
done through a secure page and often works things out to both
parties’ satisfaction. There is no extra charge for this service for
the SquareTrade member, and no charge at all for the other party.
If things don’t work out, the next step is to involve an online medi-
ator. The mediator works as a facilitator to produce solution-
oriented discussion between the parties. Online mediators aren’t
judges or arbitrators, and will only recommend a resolution if the
parties request it.
The party who files the case pays $20 for the mediator. This type of
mediation costs a good deal more, but eBay subsidizes the major-
ity of the costs involved.
If you ever get negative feedback (arghhh!) and both you and the
other party come to terms to resolve the issue after the feedback is
left, there is only one way that you can get that feedback removed.
If you apply for SquareTrade mediation and the opposing party
tells the mediator that he or she has agreed to its removal, the
offending feedback will be expunged from your soon-to-be unblem-
ished record.
Buying Internationally
Please be careful when doing business overseas. Especially watch
out for counterfeit brand-name items. Even if you’re in the right, if
you’ve paid for an item, getting a refund may be impossible.
Chapter 6: Shopping Safely 87

Sometimes the risk of shopping with an overseas seller is neces-
sary. I have done it, and many buyers at eBay do it all the time.
Keep in mind a couple of tips to avoid getting duped in your inter-
national transactions:
 International shipping costs will be considerably higher.
 You may be on the hook for customs fees when the item
arrives in your home country.
 For safety’s sake, pay only through a third-party service like
PayPal. Sending a money order to a foreign country is like
mailing away cash.
PayPal will only send your payment to certain countries. The
service keeps track of which countries are ravaged by fraud,
and flatly refuses to do business where the risk is too great.
PayPal maintains a page of countries that it does business
with. When you check this page, be sure to read it closely. 
In some cases, PayPal won’t send your money to certain coun-
tries, but will let users send money to sellers. For a current
list of the countries that PayPal will transact business in, go
to http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/
approved_countries-outside.

Bidding verification
If you decide to shoot the works and get involved in one of eBay’s high-dollar (or
high-profile) auctions, you will become familiar with a service called Transrow, an
eBay preferred provider.
Transrow is a service that protects the seller from those who enjoy making spuri-
ous bids on items for fun. Before bidding on a very expensive item, you may see a
link that says you must call the Transrow 1-800 number to prequalify, to be sure that
your bid is in earnest. Once on the phone, Transrow verifies that you are who you
say you are, and how you intend to pay for the item. 
To see more information on Transrow (and to see a list of the auctions the business
is currently working with at eBay), go to www.transrow.com.

Protecting Yourself from
Having a Bad Transaction
In This Chapter
 Protecting yourself against fraud
 Introducing the Verified Rights Owner Program
 What eBay will (and won’t) investigate
 Finding additional protection
I
n Chapter 6, I talked about things you can do to protect yourself
when shopping at eBay. 
You mustn’t forget that eBay is a venue. When you bid, win, and
pay for an item, you’re doing business with another person using
the eBay site. Technically, eBay’s only function is that it created
the online environment in which you and the seller could meet,
shake hands, and do business. In other words, eBay has nothing
to do with your transactions. That said, of course, eBay has a
vested interest in making sure that your transactions go well, so
that you’ll come back and buy and sell more stuff. So eBay put
policies into place for everyone’s protection.
In this chapter, I go over what eBay has to offer in the way of
protection.
Identifying What Makes a
Transaction Fraudulent
At the outset, I’d like to get one thing straight: It’s about fraud.
What is fraud? Is it fraud when you get an item that isn’t what you
“thought” it would look like? Is it fraud when your item doesn’t
arrive and you neglected to pay additional for shipping insurance?

Is it fraud when you buy a diamond ring and a stunning cubic zirco-
nium model arrives? Well, no, absolutely no — and yes.
According to the National Consumers League (www.fraud.org),
online auctions top the online fraud list for 2002. Well, maybe. I
think that if all the people who screamed “Fraud!” when their item
arrived in cerise cherry instead of raging red were weeded out of
the statistic, the online auction venue might have been lower on
the list.
The fine line between caveat emptor (buyer beware) and fraud has
to do with the questions you choose to ask. It is your responsibility
to ask all possible questions before you buy; the seller doesn’t
have to tell you anything. That said, of course, the seller isn’t
allowed to lie to you.
Say you bid on a piece of bone china and when you pull the item
out of the box you realize that it has a chip in it. Before you bid,
did you ask whether there were any chips? If not, then you really
weren’t defrauded.
Well, okay. But it’s not even that simple. You may have been
defrauded if you didn’t ask the seller about the condition because
the seller listed the item as chip free or even as being in mint con-
dition. Notice, I said may have been.
If the seller did advertise the bone china as mint, flawless, free of
chips, or something like that, be sure to e-mail the seller and see if
he or she was even aware of the flaw before you yell fraud. Maybe
you can get your money back.
Communication and cooperation are central to being a successful
eBay member. If you have a difference of opinion with another
user, write a polite e-mail outlining your issues and offer to settle
any dispute by phone. See Chapter 5 for tips on communicating
after the auction ends and solving disputes before they turn aggres-
sive, belligerent, or offensive. And don’t forget to write fair, unemo-
tional feedback about your transaction experiences.
Fraud Protection Program
Most transactions go off without a hitch. Sometimes, things go
wrong. But of all the bad things that can happen (packages getting
lost in the mail, items arriving that don’t match the item descrip-
tion, and so on) less than 1/100th of 1 percent of eBay transactions
turn out to be fraudulent. Even so, eBay has gone the distance by
providing an insurance policy of sorts for eBay shoppers.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
90

Even though I am very careful about who I am willing to do busi-
ness with in the first place, I’m also always careful that my transac-
tions are covered by eBay insurance. The way I figure it, the more
business you do, the more likely that you’ll eventually need insur-
ance. That’s just the way the law of averages works.
There are several types of insurance available to eBay buyers, as
shown in Table 7-1.
Table 7-1
eBay Shopper’s Insurance
Type of Insurance
Who Pays
Explanation
Shipping insurance
Buyer
As the buyer, you must pay the
seller the additional charge for
package insurance. This will
cover your purchase up to the
insured amount while in transit
through the U.S. Postal Service,
UPS, or Federal Express.
eBay fraud protection
No charge
Buyer is automatically covered
up to $200 when a purchase is
made at eBay from an eBay
seller.
PayPal insurance
No charge
If eBay agrees that you’ve been
defrauded, and you’ve paid for
your purchase through PayPal to
a PayPal-verified seller (see
Chapter 8) you’re covered for an
additional $200.
SquareTrade buyer 
No charge
SquareTrade will pay up to $500
protection program
(above and beyond any other
insurance coverage you may
have) if you have been defrauded
by a SquareTrade seal member.
Getting eBay fraud insurance
The Fraud Protection Program provided by eBay covers the cost of
purchase for an item that never makes it to your door. This cover-
age is only doled out if the package doesn’t arrive because of a
fraudulent transaction — it doesn’t cover shipping errors or other
mishaps.
Chapter 7: Protecting Yourself from Having a Bad Transaction 91

You’re also covered if you get the item and you find it to be mate-
rially different from the item in the auction’s description.
(Remember the definition of fraud? If not, see “Identifying What
Makes a Transaction Fraudulent” earlier in this chapter.)
eBay insurance covers you to a maximum of $200 coverage per
transaction; minus a $25 deductible. So if you file a $50 claim, you
get $25. If you file a $5,000 claim, you get only $175. (But I hope
that if you’re going to spend that kind of scratch at eBay, you pro-
tect yourself by dealing with a PayPal- or SquareTrade-verified
seller.)
To file a claim, you must file a Fraud Alert at eBay’s Fraud Reporting
System within 30 (and no later than 60) days after the auction
ends. I doubt you’ll ever need the link, but if you ever need to file
a Fraud Alert, go to http://crs.ebay.com/aw-cgi/ebayisapi.
dll?crsstartpage.
After you file the alert, eBay e-mails you a link to the final online
protection claim form. You fill it out, return it to eBay, and you
should have results in a maximum of 90 days.
PayPal buyer insurance
In addition to filing a claim at eBay, if you’ve paid for an item
through PayPal and you feel a fraud is in the air, rush to file a com-
plaint with the PayPal Buyer Complaint form.
It’s crucial that you go through PayPal (rather than going directly
to your credit card company). As I discuss in Chapter 8, PayPal
handles claims made against sellers.
If you feel your situation is a case of fraud, and eBay agrees
with you, you are also covered by PayPal’s $200 additional cov-
erage. Visit www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/
protections-buyer-outside for more information.
You can also click the Security Center link on the bottom of any
page on the PayPal site.
SquareTrade buyer protection
program
SquareTrade has a buyer protection program that provides fraud
coverage in addition to the $200 provided by eBay and PayPal.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
92

That means the entire group of programs may protect you, if you
meet the eligibility guidelines.
Your coverage depends on the level of coverage each SquareTrade
seal member applies for within his or her membership; the max
is $550.
One caveat: It’s quite unlikely that a SquareTrade seal holder is
going to defraud you. SquareTrade checks sellers’ feedback and
reports on a daily basis to be sure they’re playing within the eBay
rules. SquareTrade yanks back its seal of approval if anything fishy
appears to be going on.
Verified Rights Owner Program
Another reminder: eBay is a venue. It is a place where sellers sell
their wares to smart shoppers like you. No one at eBay owns the
items, and no one at eBay can guarantee that items are as
described in auction listings.
That means that you could, theoretically, buy a “genuine” Kate
Spade purse at eBay for $24, and immediately realize when it
arrives that the purse is counterfeit . . . and that’s not eBay’s fault.
It’s not that eBay doesn’t care, that’s why the eBay Powers That Be
instituted the VERO (Verified Rights Owner) program.
Shame on you for thinking you could get that kind of deal on a
new Kate Spade purse (but if you can, e-mail me and let me know
where).
Just because, technically, eBay doesn’t take the blame for its fraud-
ulent sellers’ handiwork, doesn’t mean that eBay doesn’t care if
you get duped. Seriously, the VERO program connects eBay with
companies or persons that care to protect their intellectual prop-
erty rights (such as a copyright, trademark, or patent), which
could possibly be infringed by an eBay listing.
If the Kate Spade people register at eBay as a VERO member, they
give eBay the right to end auctions that they find on the site to be
questionable.
VERO members send proof to eBay that they own the specified
intellectual property. In return, they can report infringements to
eBay, and eBay’s listing police will end the counterfeit listings. This
is not an automatic service, and the property owners are responsi-
ble to find their own infringements on the site.
Chapter 7: Protecting Yourself from Having a Bad Transaction 93

Many of the VERO members have their own About Me pages. To
see a list of links to their pages go to http://pages.ebay.com/
help/community/vero-aboutme.html.
Knowing What eBay Investigates
Although eBay encourages the community to police the site, it
also does its own investigations. You’re a beginner, so I’m going to
stress the buying violations. Some of them are very easy to fall
into — and I don’t want you getting in trouble on your first transac-
tion. For now, here’s the short list of things that eBay will look into. 
There are rules for buyers as well as sellers. If you are reported
and found responsible for any of the below offenses, you may be
subject to disciplinary action. Violations may result in the indefi-
nite suspension of a user’s account, temporary suspension, or a
formal warning. (Brrrrr . . .)
Buyer violations
Here’s the skinny on the kinds of buyer violations eBay looks into.
Many of these violations go both ways. For example, if a seller
e-mails you and offers to do a deal with you off the site, that’s a
violation from the seller’s side. If another eBay member pulls any
of these kinds of tricks with you, feel obliged to report him or her
to eBay:
 Transaction interference: If anyone sends an e-mail to other
buyers warning them away from a particular seller or mer-
chandise, eBay will investigate.
 Off-site purchases: Contacting the seller and offering to buy
(or sell) the item outside of eBay.
 Invalid bid retractions: Misuse of the bid retraction process
is a serious eBay violation.
Every bid you place is a binding contract to buy. Even if eBay
somehow didn’t investigate you for retracting bids, the rest of
the community would ostracize you — eBay members show
no pity for serial bid retractors. (That’s why bid retractions
are listed on your ID card — see Chapter 5.)
 Non-payment after winning an item: If you bid or use the Buy
It Now option, you must pay for your item. Again, not only
does refusing to pay for items get you a scarlet letter, but it
could result in your complete and total suspension from the
eBay service. Forever. Period.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
94

 Unwelcome buyer: If you bid or shop from a seller who
clearly states terms that you do not fulfill, you’ll be investi-
gated. For example, Susie Seller can state in her item descrip-
tion that she refuses to sell to someone with negative
feedback. If you have any negatives, then you shouldn’t bid. If
you do, and you win, you may be investigated.
If you really want the item, I suggest that you e-mail the seller
and ask if you may bid on the item, even if you don’t fulfill his
or her terms — it never hurts to ask.
Another common example has to do with international ship-
ping. Say Steve Seller says that he will only ship within the
United States, and you live in another country. If you bid and
win the auction, you may be investigated.
 Bid shielding or shill bidding: Using a secondary ID to ille-
gally manipulate the price of an item, without any intention of
ever paying for it, is verboten and will be investigated.
Chapter 7: Protecting Yourself from Having a Bad Transaction 95
Finding the eBay life raft
Sometimes things happen, and you just don’t know what to do about it. Maybe you
have made a heinous mistake (who, me?), or you’ve seen something on the site that
seems fishy. Who can you go to? Who’s there to listen?
The Rules and Safety area of the eBay site has a support page where you may
describe the problem using a series of drop-down menus. After using this system
to explain your situation, you will usually get a response within 24-48 hours. The
magic Web address for eBay’s Rules and Safety support form is: http://pages.
ebay.com/help/basics/select-RS.html.

Where Else You Can Go for Support
I certainly think that eBay and the like give us plenty of places to
go. But if things really get out of hand, you can go further to punish
fraudulent sellers on your own.
Here’s the list:
 United States postal inspector: If your deal involved the
United States Post Office in any way, you can file a mail fraud
complaint through the Postal Inspector’s office. Your deal
would involve the post office if you sent the seller payment
through the mail and the seller sends you merchandise (or
doesn’t send at all) that is not what you ordered. To see the
actual laws involved in mail fraud, go to www.usps.com/
websites/depart/inspect/usc18.
Call (800) 275-8777 or your local post office for the required
forms and information. After you file a fraud report, the USPS
contacts the alleged bad guy on your behalf.
 National Fraud Information Center: The National Fraud
Information Center is based in Washington, D.C. This organiza-
tion collects reports of fraud and transmits the information to
the National Fraud Database, maintained by the Federal Trade
Commission and the National Association of Attorneys General.
You can file your report online at www.fraud.org/info/
repoform.htm or you can call (800) 876-7060.
The information you provide by filing a complaint with the
NFIC informs federal and state regulators of potential illegal
activities. It will not, on the other hand, get you your money
back. By just reporting fraud, you can help prevent wrong-
doers from victimizing others.
 Local law enforcement agencies: Contact the District Attorney
or state Attorney General’s office in the seller’s city and supply
as much information as these officers will take. You may also
want to try the state’s consumer affairs department — just
run a Web search with the state’s name and consumer affairs.
Again, this option probably won’t get you your money back,
but may make you feel better.
 FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection: The Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) Bureau of Consumer Protection runs a
very popular Web site that takes complaints on fraud of all
kinds. To file a complaint, go to https://rn.ftc.gov/
dod/wsolcq$.startup?Z_ORG_CODE=PU01.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
96

The FTC, in turn, works with many other leading crime pre-
vention organizations. The FTC will send your information to
all interested law enforcement organizations through its Web
site: www.consumer.gov/sentinel/.
There’s a good deal of solid information (some pretty scary infor-
mation, as well) on this site. Check it out and help the good guys!
Internet service provider
As you know, every e-mail address ends with a @something.com or
@something.net (or something like that). That something is the
name of the person’s ISP, or Internet service provider.
ISPs get very peeved when their users do illegal stuff online. Check
out the ISP’s Web site for fraud links, or try to report your issue to
an e-mail address (usually, the address is something like fraud@
ISPname.com). Let the ISP know that you have filed a complaint
against one of its customers, explain the nature of the problem, and
list the other agencies that you’ve contacted. They will usually take
notice and may suspend the account of the company in question.
A very thin line separates alerting other members to a particular
member’s poor behavior and breaking an eBay cardinal rule by
interfering with an auction. Feel free to hunt for facts, but don’t
point fingers on public message boards or chat rooms. If it turns
out that you’re wrong, you can be sued for libel.

Ways to Pay for Your Stuff
In This Chapter
 Making PayPal payments
 Using your credit card safely
 Sending money orders in the mail
 Buying cashier’s checks
W
hen I talk to people about why they don’t buy at eBay, one
of the most popular answers is that they are afraid of giving
out their credit card information. The second-most common
reason is that they don’t want to send money to strangers. In addi-
tion to all the eBay safeguards that I mentioned in previous chap-
ters, here’s the inside scoop on how to stay safe when sending
your payment to the sellers. You’ll be surprised to know that there
are distinct levels of safety in how you can send payment to a
seller.
I’m not going to discuss this at length. Just take my word for it. Do
not send cash through the mail to anyone. Ever.
Paying with PayPal
PayPal is my preferred method of payment at eBay. I’ve been hap-
pily using PayPal since the company was first introduced to eBay,
and I have always had positive results. Well, okay, not always. No
service can make a slow or lazy seller into the picture of efficiency.
The advantage of PayPal, though, is that you don’t have to get your
hands dirty.
For example, once, I had a problem with a slow-shipping seller and
luckily I had paid him through PayPal. I filed a complaint through
PayPal and I got my merchandise delivered within a day!

The fine people at eBay know a good thing when they see it, and
the company acquired PayPal late in 2002; now PayPal payments
are directly integrated it into eBay’s checkout process.
Registering your data
First things first. It might be more convenient to register at PayPal,
before you want to buy something. It’s free and easy — and more
convenient. Follow these steps:
1. Go to the PayPal home page at www.PayPal.com.
2. Look for a link in the upper-right corner of the page that
says Sign Up. Yep, that’s right, click there.
Signing up for a PayPal personal account is a very simple
procedure — one single page.
3. Give your name, address, phone number, and e-mail
address. You also have to make up a password.
Make your password more than six characters, and use
numbers and letters! — revisit Chapter 1 for more informa-
tion on registration security.
4. Select a security question.
The safest is your pet’s name, city of birth, or the last four
digits of your Social Security number.
Then you’ll come to a security test. This is a special tech-
nology that prevents people from making continuous auto-
mated registrations on the site.
5. Type the characters in the yellow box, as you see them
(without any spaces).
Next, you’ll be asked if you want a Premier Account. This
may be something you want at a later date, but for now,
unless you intend to sell, pass it by.
6. Click in the box that says No.
You also have to click in the check box that indicates that
you have read and agree to PayPal’s User Agreement and
Privacy Policy.
7. When you’re convinced that you understand what
PayPal’s all about and what it expects of you, click the
button that says Sign Up.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
100

There are links so you can read all about PayPal. Feel free
to click them.
PayPal sends you an e-mail confirming your registration.
The e-mail arrives almost instantaneously to the e-mail
address you used at registration, and it contains a link.
8. When you receive the e-mail, click the link to visit the
PayPal site.
9. Enter the password that was used to create your account.
Bingo — you’re in.
Giving PayPal credit card (or
checking account) information
After you become a member of PayPal, you’ll be asked to input a
credit card to cover your purchases. That is, if you want to pay for
anything with a credit card. It can be your choice — anything you
wish from MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover. 
If you don’t have a credit card or would like to occasionally pay for
things directly from your bank account, you’ll have to register your
checking account. Once you do, you can purchase things and debit
your checking account for payment.
How your credit card company
handles PayPal transactions
To be a good consumer, you need to take responsibility for your
transactions; be sure you understand your credit cards terms and
conditions when it comes to third-party payment services. Each
credit card company has its own agreement with PayPal and each
company has a different view on how to handle PayPal transac-
tions. For example, Visa and MasterCard treat PayPal as the
“Merchant of Record” in your transactions, meaning that PayPal
ends up as the responsible party if you don’t receive the merchan-
dise or if you dispute the transaction. If you make a complaint
about a charge made on your Visa or MasterCard, the credit card
company just yanks the money from PayPal, and it’s up to PayPal
to settle things with the seller.
Chapter 8: Ways to Pay for Your Stuff 101

Because of the way credit cards deal with this kind situation, it is
of utmost importance that if you have an issue with a seller, you
report the seller first to PayPal! Do not go to your credit card com-
pany before contacting PayPal. PayPal will do its utmost to protect
itself — and you — from being ripped off.
At the time of this writing, Discover and American Express treat
PayPal transactions somewhat like a cash advance — a money
transfer of sorts. I just checked a couple of my past Discover and
American Express bills, and the PayPal charges look like any other
charges. You can’t tell the difference. The only difference is how
these credit card companies handle their level of liability in third-
party payment services.
This is the main reason PayPal backs up eBay’s insurance (see
Chapter 7) with $200 additional coverage (see “Giving PayPal
credit card (or checking account) information” earlier in this chap-
ter). This coverage is good for purchases up to $400.
I can see you beginning to squirm from here, you’re not terribly
comfortable giving that type of information to anyone, much less
putting it out on the Internet. I’m very glad you feel that way, but
relax. PayPal uses military-strength encryption technology to keep
your account information safe, so don’t be afraid to give up your
data.
To register your credit card, you’ll have to input the name on the
card (the last name is already filled in with the name you regis-
tered on the account), the expiration date and the Card Verification
number. The Card Verification number is the three-digit number on
the back of the card, imprinted next to the card number in the area
where you sign. PayPal also asks you to supply a billing address.
On an American Express card, the Card Verification number is the
four-digit number on the right side of the face of the card.
When you enter all the information PayPal needs, click the Add
button.
PayPal submits your information to your credit card company for
confirmation. This process may take a minute or so, but eventually,
your credit card company says that you are who you say you are;
the card is added to your PayPal account. You can register four
active credit cards.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
102

Registering your checking account is just as easy. You supply the
information from the bottom of one of your checks as shown in
Figure 8-1.
Figure 8-1: Provide your bank routing 
number and your account number.
Getting verified
When PayPal has the information it needs, it makes two small
deposits into that account. (When I say small, I mean small!). This
is so that PayPal can verify that the bank account is yours. When
you opened your account at your bank, you had to provide certain
levels of identification. By verifying you with your bank, PayPal can
check your identity as well. After a week or so, call your bank and
find out the amount of these two deposits. When you have the
amounts, sign in to the PayPal Web site, with your password, and
type the amounts in the appropriate place and voila, your account
is registered — and, not coincidentally, you’re verified!
PayPal has confirmed that you hold an active account with your
bank. All banks are required to screen their account holders, and
verification authenticates your identity to anyone who does busi-
ness with you.
Here are some benefits of being PayPal-verified:
 Verification increases your spending limit from $2,000 to
unlimited!
(Uh-Oh!)
 Now you can register eight active credit cards instead of four.
(So you can reach unlimited $$ faster?)
 You’re covered by PayPal’s additional $200 fraud insurance.
(That’s worth the trouble!)
Chapter 8: Ways to Pay for Your Stuff 103

If your eBay purchase qualifies for coverage under eBay’s fraud
protection plan (which I describe in Chapter 7) you are also cov-
ered for an additional $200 from PayPal when you purchase your
item from a PayPal Verified seller. This is, provided that you are a
verified buyer. (To see if a seller is verified by PayPal, look for a
PayPal Verified icon in his or her eBay auction, as shown in
Figure 8-2.)
Figure 8-2: Look for the PayPal Verified 
icon when selecting a PayPal seller.
Ways to pay through PayPal
The easiest and most efficient way to pay for eBay purchases is by
credit card. If you are not a PayPal-verified buyer, you still have
your credit card’s fraud protection guarantee behind you.
You may also send money directly from your bank account (either
savings or checking) through instant transfers or eChecks — as
long as you have check writing privileges for the account.
 Instant transfer: An instant transfer is immediately debited
from your bank account and deposited into the seller’s
account — so you’d best be sure you have the funds in your
account to back up the purchase now (not tomorrow, not next
week). PayPal requires you to back up an instant transfer with
a credit card, just in case you’ve miscalculated your account
balance.
Find help for this type of transaction at www.paypal.com/
cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_help-ext&eloc=230&unique_id=
01718&source_page=_home.
 eCheck: PayPal also lets you pay for your purchases with an
eCheck, which is just like writing a check, only you don’t write
it with a pen. Like regular, plain-vanilla paper checks, eChecks
take three to four days to clear, and do not post to the seller’s
account as paid until then.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
104

Sellers will not ship your item until the eCheck clears, so if
you’re in a hurry, don’t use this option.
Using PayPal’s AuctionFinder
PayPal also has a service called AuctionFinder. Here’s how it
works. Say you’ve just won a bunch of auctions by different sellers,
and you want to pay for them all at once. Okay, so visit the PayPal
site and sign in.
After you sign in you’re taken to your main account page. In the
center of the page, you see your recent account activity. There will
also be links to All Activity, Auctions Won, and Auctions Sold.
Click the Auctions Won link. PayPal searches the eBay site and
finds all the auctions you’ve won at eBay that haven’t been paid for
by PayPal. See Figure 8-3 for a glance at the AuctionFinder.
You must click the link for every auction to be sure that the seller
accepts PayPal because all current auctions you’ve won at eBay
(until you pay them on PayPal or remove them from the Finder)
show up on AuctionFinder.
On the PayPal AuctionFinder page, just click the Pay button and go
through the payment process. Click the Remove button to exclude
sellers who don’t accept PayPal.
Figure 8-3: AuctionFinder on PayPal.
Chapter 8: Ways to Pay for Your Stuff 105

Making a PayPal Payment
After you win an auction, buy an item in a Buy It Now transaction,
or purchase an item from an eBay store, it’s time to pay. If the
seller has a clickable link to PayPal, you can pay immediately by
clicking the Pay Now icon, as in Figure 8-4, on the item page.
Figure 8-4: Pay now by clicking here when you want to pay 
for your item through PayPal.
After clicking the Pay Now icon, a second browser window opens,
as shown in Figure 8-5. Double-check that all the purchase informa-
tion is correct. If insurance is optional, and you don’t want ship-
ping insurance, just delete the amount.
Figure 8-5: Signing in to make your payment with PayPal.
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
106

Assuming that you’ve already become a registered (verified)
PayPal user, you see a place at the very bottom of the page to
input your e-mail address and password. Fill in this info, and then
click the Continue button.
A page appears, and you must decide whether you want to pay by
credit card or bank transfer. Finalize all the details of your transac-
tion, by selecting your payment method in the Source of Funds
area. The default (if you have no money from sales in your
account) is an instant transfer of funds from your bank. If you
prefer to use your credit card, be sure to click the More Funding
Options link to change the payment method to your credit card.
You can even send a note to the seller along with your payment.
Within moments of your payment, PayPal sends sellers an e-mail
saying that it has received your payment. Although there is a place
for you to leave a note for the seller, the note is buried in this much
longer e-mail message that PayPal sends, and it’s hard to find. If
you want some information to go to the seller regarding your trans-
action, send the information in a separate e-mail message. 
All important messages should be sent separately. Put the eBay
item number in the Subject line.
Using Your Credit Card Safely
The safest way to shop at eBay is to use a credit card either
directly through a secure site or through an online service such as
PayPal. In most cases, your credit card company (or online pay-
ment service) will stand behind you (and refund your payment) if
you encounter problems using your card online.
Debit cards and credit cards are two entirely different things.
Companies will back your purchases on a credit card (remember
that the credit card company gets a small percentage for its trou-
ble) versus a debit card, which is actually a direct withdrawal from
your checking account.
Knowing your credit card
company’s policy
First (before you start bidding), find out how your credit card han-
dles fraud claims. (Check out Chapter 7 for more on avoiding and
Chapter 8: Ways to Pay for Your Stuff 107

reporting fraud.) The major credit card companies — American
Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa — all have different poli-
cies as to how they will stand behind you when it comes to online
purchases:
 American Express: American Express offers “ironclad protec-
tion” for online shoppers. The company claims that there’s “no
fine print and no deductible” if you need to rely on American
Express to help you fight a fraudulent transaction. Visit www.
americanexpress.com/cards/online_guarantee.
 Discover: Discover offers 100 percent fraud protection. The
company even offers free, downloadable software that gener-
ates a single-use card number. With this program, each time
you shop online, your account number is never actually trans-
ferred over the Internet. Visit www2.discovercard.com/
simple_secure/fraudprotection.shtml.
 MasterCard: The program offered by MasterCard is called
Zero Liability, and is offered if MasterCard deems your
account in good standing, you haven’t broadcast personal
account information online frivolously, and that you limit the
number of unauthorized events you report each last year.
I believe it appears that MasterCard is the final judge when it
comes to fraud, not you, so be careful. Be sure you document
all your purchases by printing out the auction and all e-mails
during and after the transaction. Visit www.mastercard.com/
general/zero_liability.html.
 Visa: Visa seems to like the phrase zero liability, as well. Your
liability for unauthorized transactions is $0. A new program,
called Verified by Visa, lets you set up your own private pass-
word that you use with your Visa card any time you use it
online, adding another layer of security to your transaction.
Visit www.usa.visa.com/personal/secure_with_visa/
zero_liability.html.
In addition to double-checking your statement every month,
check your credit card company’s Web site or call the credit
card company’s customer service department every once and
a while to verify its current fraud protection policy for online
purchases.
Never — really, I mean never ever — send your credit card
information to anyone through e-mail. E-mail is the most inse-
cure way to send information. As your e-mail makes its way
from your computer to the recipient’s desktop, it wends its
Part II: Staying Safe While Shopping at eBay 
108

way across the country making micro stops hither and yon
along the way. These stops may take just nanoseconds, but
your information is open for reading by outside parties (at
least those who have the right expertise) at any stop along
the journey.
Adding a layer of protection with
an online checkout service
Many eBay sellers use an independent online checkout service that
allows them to process shipping information, combine purchases,
give an exact shipping total, and receive credit card payments. If
the seller uses such a service, when you win the auction, you’ll
probably see a clickable link in the e-mail that’s sent to you at the
end of the auction. The link leads you to an online checkout page.
There are many of these services on the site such as
AuctionWorks, Channel Advisor and Zoovy. (See Chapter 2 for a
demonstration of the third-party checkout process.)
Chapter 8: Ways to Pay for Your Stuff 109
Beware the money order
For the same reason that eBay sellers love money orders, you really have to be
excruciatingly careful to whom you send money orders. The bottom line is that you
are sending cash. A seller can cash a money order and “forget” to send you the
merchandise you paid for. How could a seller possibly forget to send you something
you paid for with your hard-earned money? Cash payment = no receipt. No receipt
= no paper trail. No paper trail = no proof. No proof = seller amnesia. I’m not saying
that sellers are dishonest. Most are very honest, especially the ones with a high
feedback rating! 
The only paper trail is the cashed money order, and unless it was cashed at a place
where they actually know the payee (like the bank), the money order could have
been stolen and cashed by someone else. For example, if you pay by money order,
you have no recourse other than reporting problems to some federal agency about
mail fraud. I’m sure that some nice government employee will happily take a report
and sound very interested and sympathetic, but bottom line — you’ll be out your
money. Plus, you don’t get the extra muscle that you get when a credit card com-
pany backs you up.
If your transaction falls within eBay’s fraud protection policy, you’ll be covered up
to $200, but if not, you could be kissing your money goodbye. Caveat emptor!

Checking for sure signs of security
When you come to the point at any checkout online that requires
that you input your credit card information, (see Figure 8-6) there
are a couple of very important things to look for:
 Be sure that the site that hosts the checkout is secure: Look
for icons in the lower-right corner in the status bar of your
Internet browser (either a small closed padlock or a key).
 Check for an s: The URL (address of the Web site) may
change from a prefix of http:// to https:// (the s stands
for secure).
 Look for an SSL: You may also see the initials SSL in the Web
site’s address or somewhere on the page. SSL stands for
Secure Socket Layer.
Any, some, or all of the above items indicate that the Web
site uses security encryption methods. Translation? No one
but you and the merchant can read or view your payment
information.

Sending Money Orders
Money orders are beloved by all eBay sellers! Even though PayPal
is usually their first choice — because payment arrives almost
instantaneously and sellers avoid having to track payments they’re
waiting for — money orders are a close second because they are
just like cash.
Many hobbyist sellers just cash their money orders, or bring
postal money orders with them to the post office to pay for
postage. No fuss, no muss — no need to deposit the money order
in the bank. Get it? (Wink, wink.)
You can purchase money orders at the post office in amounts up to
$500, but, of course you have to pay a 90-cent fee. If you don’t want
to wait in line, convenience stores and supermarkets sell them for
around $1. Don’t waste your money and get a money order at your
bank; money orders are a big profit item for bankers. The banks
usually charge around $5 for the privilege of purchasing a money
order!
There’s an online service called BidPay (www.bidpay.com) that’s
owned by Western Union (the venerable telegram people have
come of age). BidPay can sell you a money order (charged to your
credit or debit card) and mail it to the seller for you. BidPay
charges $2.95 for money orders up to $30, and $5 for money orders
up to $100. Amounts over $100 are 2.25% + $5.00. (This may seem
like a pricey option, but you might find it useful if you’re glued to
your computer.)
Personal Checks
Personal checks are not a preferred method of payment by veteran
sellers at eBay for many reasons. Let me explain why using an
illustration:
I sold a beautiful brand new Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress
(retail price $350 — an eBay bargain at $139!) to a lovely lady
in the east. She sent me a check, which I immediately deposited.
I waited 10 business days, which was my policy, and sent the
dress on the 11th day. On the 12th day, the bank returned the
check to me. Certainly this lady knew her check had bounced.
Chapter 8: Ways to Pay for Your Stuff 111

She could have e-mailed me to let me know, but she didn’t. I
called the buyer, and she sent a money order that covered
both the check and my bounced check fees my bank charged
me. But I didn’t need the aggravation, and I was very lucky.
Many sellers never get their money. Bounced checks can be
a real problem for eBay sellers.
I’ll give you a very important reason never to send a check to
anyone when you shop at eBay. As a matter of fact, when you read
my warning, you may never want to write a check in a store again.
Take a glance again at Figure 8-1 in this chapter.
Remember that information on your check? Think about what
someone might be able to do with that information and your home
address. If someone really wants to, he or she also can get your
phone number. And if you have your Social Security number on
your check, (which you shouldn’t) someone can practically set up
shop as you!
Save yourself the trouble. Don’t send out personal checks.

In this part. . . 
T
he only way to get the best deals on the right items is
to make sure that you ﬁnd exactly what you’re looking
for before you bid. Part III shows you all the tricks to ﬁnd-
ing an item at eBay. Memorize a couple of tricks in these
chapters, and you’ll be shopping with savvy in a ﬂash. And
eventually, the search bug will hit you with such regularity
that you won’t even realize it. A case in point: While I was
writing this introduction, I realized I was running out of a
nutritional supplement that I use. I did a search for the
product at eBay and bought it using the Buy It Now
option. Before I ﬁnished typing the sentence you’re read-
ing, the product was ordered, the shipping was paid, and I
had spent less money than I would have if I’d gone to the
neighborhood health food store!

In This Chapter
 Finding home page specials

 Introducing the Navigation Bar
T
he best (and most sensible place) to begin your hunt for that
special bargain is at the eBay home page. I like to think of the
home page as an entrance to the future of shopping — no crowds
to jostle you around, no lines to stand in, and no foolish clerks.
No one looking over your shoulder, judging what you’re browsing
around for; no one saying, “Those golf clubs are for pros, we have
beginner’s clubs over here.”
The eBay home page is neatly divided up into compartments that
contain links to other parts of the eBay site. From here you can go
anywhere, and until you are familiar with navigating the site, it’s
best to make this your point of entry. 
There is an eBay logo on the upper-left corner of every eBay page.
If you ever find yourself lost on the site and want to return to the
home page, just click the word eBay to be transported back home.
Home Page Specials
The home page is sprinkled with small pictures that link to bar-
gains and seasonal specials that are being featured throughout the
site. Smack-dab in the center of the top of the page, eBay displays
some special or timely sale items.

For example, at around Grammy time, the home page featured a
charity auction that was tied in with the awards show (as shown
in Figure 9-1). The organizers of the specials area want to make
sure that eBay reflects what’s going on in the world at the moment.
It also wants to keep up with the trends so that members can find
the deals of the day.
Featured auctions
One special area of the home page is the teaser for eBay’s featured
auctions (see Figure 9-2).
Featured auctions are fun to browse if you have the time. Sellers
pay extra to have their auctions featured and linked to the home
page for the extra exposure, but the auctions are also listed in
eBay’s categories. If you perform a search as described in Chap-
ter 10, or browse the categories, as in Chapter 11, you won’t miss
these gems. eBay changes the links on a timed basis.

Seasonal promotions
Further down the page, eBay lists seasonal specials that tie in
with just what’s hot — and what’s selling that time of year (see
Figure 9-3). Other times — say during ski season — eBay displays
colorful graphics in this spot with links to bargains on ski equip-
ment and deals on everything you’ll need to make your ski vaca-
tion complete.

Chapter 9: Home: A Good Place to Start 117

Sidebar Links
Along the left side of the home page, eBay displays links to major
shopping areas of the eBay site. These are important links that
don’t change very often. The top section leads to eBay’s specialty
sites:
 eBay Motors (see Chapter 18)
 eBay Stores (see Chapter 15)
 Half.com (see Chapter 15)
 PayPal, eBay’s payment service (see Chapter 8)
 Sothebys.com (see Chapter 15)
Below the specialties listings is a very abridged list of eBay’s main
categories. The home page has no room for the 18,000 or so cate-
gory listings, so eBay lists the most popular main categories on the
front page.
If you don’t find the category you’d like to browse, you can go to
the bottom of the list and click the link to See All eBay Categories.
I give you more information on the categories in Chapter 11.
Below the listing of eBay top-level categories are links to some of
eBay’s special areas. You’ll see a quick link to the Charity area (see
Chapter 22) where sellers raise money for major charities. You’ll
also see the link to eBay’s Live Auctions, a similar site to Sothebys.
com. Unlike Sothebys.com, however, Live Auctions has live auc-
tions from a large variety of bricks-and-mortar auction houses.
You’ll also see links to professional services so you can find out-
side contractors for your business and wholesalers (where you can
find lots of great goods) if you ever decide to become a seller
at eBay (see Chapter 17).
At the very bottom of the list is a list of links to eBay sites around
the world. If you’re a U.S. citizen, you have 12 million or so listings
to choose from, but maybe that’s just not enough. Good news —
you can visit the 20 international sites. By the way, the international
sites are a great place to practice your high school French — or
Portuguese, Japanese, German — you get the idea.

Using the Navigation Bar
Because you enter eBay from the home page, I’d like to introduce
you to something you will see consistently throughout the eBay
site. There’s a very handy item on the top of the home page (and
every eBay page) that gives you links to navigate the eBay site. It’s
the Navigation Bar. This handy little tool is always there to help
you out. I find that even though I’m very familiar with where eBay
puts everything, I still use the Navigation Bar as a shortcut to get
where I want to go on the site.
First, there’s the line on the top of the Navigation Bar, which is the
part I use the most:
 Click Home to get back to the home page.
 Click My eBay to get to your very own My eBay page, where
you can track all your auctions and eBay transactions. (Read
more about it in Chapter 4.)
 Click Site Map to see a page that has links to just about any
place you need to go on the eBay site — without confusing,
extraneous illustrations and text. 
 Click Sign In to get to the sign in page, discussed in Chapter 2.
The eBay Navigation Bar doesn’t stop there. When you click the
individual boxes of the Navigation Bar, context-sensitive drop-
down links to other places at eBay appear.
When you click the Browse button, a new page appears, and the
Navigation Bar drops down with four additional boxes:
 Categories (that’s the page you’re on)
 Regions (see Chapter 15)
 Themes (see Chapter 13)
 Stores (see Chapter 15)
 Links to the Featured Auctions and Categories (see Chapter 11)
Clicking the Services button opens up one of six target pages. The
most important pages for beginners are the Buying and Selling box
and Rules and Safety pages. Everything else you need for now is
accessible from Your My eBay page, which I cover in Chapter 4.
Chapter 9: Home: A Good Place to Start 119

The Buying and Selling box links to a page that has answers to
many questions, and the Rules and Safety area is eBay’s hub for
SafeHarbor, which I cover in Chapter 7.
The Search button brings you to the Search area, which I explore
in Chapter 10. You can also get the contact information of other
members who you do business with by clicking the Find Members
button.
Click Help to visit eBay’s pop-up help system. If you have a press-
ing question, try finding the answer there.
If you’re looking for eBay’s chat boards or member posting areas,
click the Community button to see where all the warm and fuzzy
stuff goes on.

Chapter 10
Taking Advantage of eBay’s
Search Functions
In This Chapter
 Using eBay’s Search hub to find your item
 Shortcuts to search in half the time
 Finding a seller who meets your needs
A
nyone can find an auction at eBay. Finding bargains, on the
other hand, requires some finesse. The key is learning how to
search the site for the hidden deals. Just as understanding the cat-
egories is important, knowing how to work the search engine will
help you find your item for the lowest price.
When you perform a search at eBay, the search engine looks
through every one of the 10 million or so items up for sale on the
site to find the exact keywords you’re looking for.
It’s very important that you know about the item you are trying to
find. Using extra keywords can turn a search that yields very little
into a search that’s spot on.
Ace Tips to Keep in Mind
before You Start
When searching at eBay don’t forget the following:
 Ignore capitalization of proper names: eBay simply doesn’t
care whether you capitalize or leave words lowercased. eBay’s
search engine doesn’t distinguish between caps and non-caps.

 Don’t use noise words: and, a, an, or, or the are called noise
words. In searches, these words are interpreted as part of your
search unless you enclose them in quotes. Let’s say we want
to find items from the 1939 classic film, Gone with the Wind. If
you type in the proper title, you won’t get as many hits.
I got 1,592 hits from Gone with the Wind, and then 1,699, with a
search for gone wind. Many sellers drop the noise words from
their titles, so use as few keywords as you can to narrow your
search.
 Don’t search just within specific categories: Although a cate-
gory-specific search further narrows down your results, nar-
rowing your search means that you will miss a great deal of
items. Take a look at the chapter on categories, Chapter 11 for
more info.
Using the Item Search Hub
There are several ways to perform an eBay search. The easiest way
for beginners (that’s you, for now) is to go to the eBay search area.
Go to the top of any eBay page and find the Navigation Bar, shown
in Figure 10-1. Click Search.
Figure 10-1: eBay’s Navigation Bar.
Use eBay’s Search button on the Navigation Bar to perform three
types of searches. You can
 Find items
 Find members
 Set up your favorite searches
Doing a basic search
When you click Search, you’re faced with three options — you can
search for items, members, or favorite items. You’re probably look-
ing for stuff, so click Find Items. A page like the one shown in
Figure 10-2 appears.
Part III: Searching eBay 
122

Figure 10-2: Start here to do a basic search.
This is the basic search form. You’ll see the following areas in this
form. You can fill out some or all of them. The more information
you type into this form, the more narrow your search can be.
If you make your search too narrow, you may miss out on some real
bargains. If you’re looking for real bargains, incorporate the search
tips from Chapter 3.
Stumped on what words to use in your search? Think of the item
you are trying to find. Look at it and determine which words best
describe it.
For example, select the brand name, color and descriptive words.
Say your favorite china pattern has been discontinued; to search
eBay for missing pieces in the set, follow this process: 
1. Determine the manufacturer’s name. 
I’m looking for Dansk.
If you don’t have all the information you need, check out
the manufacturer’s Web site, or a Web site that specializes
in the collectible you’re looking for.
2. Specify the series, collection, pattern, or design, as well.
Sometimes there is more than one. For example, I am
searching for Bistro (the name of the collection) and
Maribo (the pattern name).
3. Narrow your search even further, if possible or necessary.
For example, I need to replace a salad plate.
4. Enter the words for your search.
Chapter 10: Taking Advantage of eBay’s Search Functions 123

For example, type Dansk Bistro Maribo salad.
If someone has listed some items with all those words in
the title, we’ll be lucky and pull up some winners.
It’s likely that the words in your initial search are buried in
the description.
5. Click in the box that says Search Title and Description.
This makes sure that information in the description is also
lassoed by your search.
If that search pulls up too many auctions, you can always
redo the search and search through the item titles only.
You see some tools to narrow down my search even fur-
ther. For example, next to the typed in keywords, there is a
drop-down box that allows you to tell the search engine to
interpret your entry. The search engine can search the title
and description for
• All the words
• Any of the words
• The exact phrase in the order it is written
6. When you’re ready, click Search.
A list of auctions, in the order of when they close (soonest
at the top) appears.
Refining even the most basic search
The search engine at eBay has become more sophisticated than
ever. If you know an item number, you can type it in to any of
eBay’s search boxes throughout the site, and eBay’s search takes
you directly to that auction item.
In addition, you can choose other criteria:
 Words to exclude: If you’re looking for some silver flatware,
and you want it to be solid, not plated, at this point, you could
type in plated so that your search would exclude an item list-
ing that has the word plated in it.
 Price range: Here’s where you can narrow down your search
to a specific price range. You can type in a low and a high
maximum amount that you’re willing to spend. 
Personally, I rarely use this option, and I don’t recommend
using it because you never know what you might miss. Just
leave the boxes blank.
Part III: Searching eBay 
124

 View results: You can choose whether you want to see All
Items with Item Number, or Gallery Items Only. Why? I’m not
sure, I always want to see all the results I can, so I leave this
on the default — All items.
 Payment method: Here you can check a box to find only items
that accept PayPal. This sort of search would exclude any
items that are selling for half or a quarter of the going price,
and only take money orders. Thanks, eBay. But no thanks —
show all the results if you want the best deal you can get.
 Search in categories: Here you can narrow your search to one
of eBay’s top-level categories. Nice idea if you know for sure
where the item is listed. But that’s a rarity because categories
cross over so much. For example, dishware could be listed in
Home & Garden, Pottery & Glass, or Antiques. 
I suggest leaving this option alone so your search encom-
passes all categories.
 Item location: You can narrow the search so that the engine
only looks at eBay’s Local Trading regions. Great idea if you’re
looking for something too bulky to ship.
 Sort by: You can also sort the order you want your results to
appear in. For example, if you want to check out auctions in
order of how soon they’re closing, choose Items Ending First. 
This is my favorite option — who knows if you’ll miss the deal
of the century while you’re sifting through hundreds of list-
ings in another order.
If you conduct the same kind of search rather regularly, and
are familiar with most of what is currently up for sale, you can
sort by Newly Listed Items First.
Lowest Prices First and Highest Prices First list the results
just as you guess they do.
Understanding the icons
When you are presented with your Search results, you may notice
there are tiny icons next to some of the items. Here’s a key to what
those little pictures mean:
 Golden yellow rising sun picture means the listing is brand
new — the icon stays on for the first 24 hours an item is
listed.
 A small camera means the seller has included a picture along
with the item description, and you must open the item listing
to see the picture.
Chapter 10: Taking Advantage of eBay’s Search Functions 125

 Flaming match means the item is hot! hot! hot! and has over
30 bids on it.
 Small blue gift box means that the seller may perform gift
services for that item, such as wrapping and shipping to
another address.
 A golden picture frame may show up in a category search,
indicating that the item is listed with a Gallery photo. Gallery
photos are the small pictures of the item that you see next to
a listing when you run a search.
 Small powder blue paddle indicates the item is being sold
through a live auction. Click the item for more details.
Performing an advanced search
An advanced search (see Figure 10-3) brings your search into
closer focus — it will narrow your search down even further than
the basic search functions. All the same options are available here,
plus a few extra.
Figure 10-3: The second tab, eBay’s Advanced Search.
Part III: Searching eBay 
126

They include
 Completed items: By selecting the completed option, you can
research how often the type of item you’re interested in has
sold for within the past two weeks. This is a very handy tool,
if you’re not quite sure how much to bid for an item.
Gone are the days of being able to really research an item by
studying completed auctions with a title and description
search. eBay now limits completed auction searches to title
only. This can severely hinder your research ability.
 Buy It Now items only: This option comes in handy when you
simply must purchase something immediately. The Buy It Now
option would work well for the pair of tickets you’ve found to
“The Producers” (when it hits your town). It could also be a
great option when you’re about to run out of your favorite
moisturizer, and you don’t have time to make it to the store
within the next week to pick some up.
When you look at your Search results, all Buy It Now items are
very clearly marked, and can also be isolated by clicking the
Buy It Now tab, as illustrated in Figure 10-4.
 Gift items only: Yee-ha! If you need an item that comes gift
wrapped (and you don’t want to see any other results),
choose this option.
Figure 10-4: The Buy It Now tab on the Search results page.
Chapter 10: Taking Advantage of eBay’s Search Functions 127

If you want an item gift wrapped and sent to another party,
always e-mail a seller ahead of time and make a request. If you
have good feedback, most sellers will be more than happy to
accommodate your gifting needs.
 Quantity Greater than 1: This can be a handy option if you’re
looking for multiples of a particular item. If you want more
than one, it never hurts to ask a seller if he or she has more of
an item. Very often sellers put additional items up for sale
upon request.
 International Searches: You may also now narrow your
search to items available to foreign countries.
Tricks to speed up your search
Item searches can be performed directly from any of the small
search boxes that dot the eBay site. There’s one on almost every
page! In Table 10-1, there are a few abbreviations that I use to
narrow down my eBay searches.
To speed up a search from pages other than the main Search page,
I recommend memorizing the shortcuts in Table 10-1. You’ll rarely,
if ever, have to go to the eBay Search area to find an item again!

Searching for items by seller
After spending time at eBay, you’ll find that you have favorite sell-
ers. You can always access a seller’s other items for sale by click-
ing the View Seller’s Other Items link on the auction page. 
The best place to keep track of your favorite sellers is on your My
eBay Favorites page (see Chapter 4).
If you’d like to see if a seller has sold an item in the past that’s simi-
lar to one you’re interested in, the seller’s search will come in very
handy (see Figure 10-5).
To search for a seller’s items, you merely have to type his or her
e-mail address or User ID in the Single Seller box.
You can choose to see the seller’s current auctions or the com-
pleted sales along with the current auctions. Just check the appro-
priate box before you conduct the search. You can also select the
display order of the items and the number of items you’d like to
see on the results.
If you have a group of sellers who you like to shop with who carry a
similar group of items, you can always use the multiple seller search.
Chapter 10: Taking Advantage of eBay’s Search Functions 129

Figure 10-5: eBay Seller’s search page.
You can use the multiple seller search to exclude up to 10 sellers
from your search results. Click in the Find Items Excluding These
Sellers option box. This function can come in handy if you’ve done
business with someone in the past who you don’t want to do busi-
ness with again. Why repeat an uncomfortable situation?
Doing a bidder search
You may wonder, “Why would I want to run a bidder search?” Well,
when you’ve been outbid by the same person several times, you
might not need to ask that question. 
If you want an item badly enough, you’ll become very interested in
the bidding patterns of others. (See Chapter 3 for more bargain
shopping secrets.) Figure 10-6 shows eBay’s Bidder Search page.
When researching your competition, always check out the bidder’s
completed auctions as well as the times he or she has been outbid.
This will give you a complete grasp of his or her bidding modus
operandi.
Part III: Searching eBay 
130

Figure 10-6: eBay’s Bidder Search.
Searching the stores
The last tab of the eBay search area is the Search stores tab. It
works exactly in the same way as the eBay Search tab. Remember
that the inventory at eBay stores is not accessible from the eBay
search engine, and you must search stores separately to find all the
items that may interest you.
At the bottom of the Stores search is a Search by Store name box.
If you can remember a portion of a previously visited eBay store
name — you may be able to find it here. For the lowdown at eBay
stores, visit Chapter 15.
Finding Other Members
The second drop-down box from the eBay Navigation Bar allows
you to find information about eBay members. When you click
the Find Members box, you can check out the User ID history of
another member, as well as get his or her contact information.
To get contact information on another eBay member, you must be
in (or have previously been in) a transaction with that member.
You’ll have to input the transaction number and the User ID of the
other member. If eBay’s computer sees that the two of you are
involved in a transaction, your name and phone number will be
sent to the other party, and you will be sent theirs. Getting this
information is very helpful if you’ve run into a snag while closing
an eBay transaction.

Chapter 11
Understanding eBay’s
Category Hierarchy
In This Chapter
 Introducing the category system
 Finding items in categories
U
nderstanding eBay’s categories was a lot easier when there
were just a few. I remember thinking that the quantity of cate-
gories was daunting when the site boosted the number up to the
unthinkable 4,000. Now that the total number of categories is
approaching the 20,000 mark, the time has come to either abandon
all hope of understanding them, or to take things in hand and
appreciate the elegance and organization of a system that’s just
beyond the realm of comprehension. You may never totally under-
stand the category structure, but that’s okay — what’s important is
knowing which categories sellers use most frequently.
As I write this book, eBay is adding, combining, and subtracting
categories every two weeks to simplify the category structure.
eBay works very hard to keep the site in an organized fashion;
however, the constant reorganizing that’s necessary can be a little
daunting for new users. Don’t worry.
How the Structure Works
Go ahead; ask me what I’m interested in. Let’s see, I like art, golf,
photography, fashion — I won’t bore you with the rest, but it
sounds like a fairly benign list, doesn’t it? I’m sure your list of inter-
ests is the same. Straightforward, right?

Well, not quite. Say you like golf as much as I do. You might just
click on the Sports category link on the home page, figuring you’ll
find Golf on the next page as a link.
Surprise! The Sports category is made up of approximately 2,700
sub, sub-sub, and sub-sub-sub categories of everything from golf
balls to Pittsburgh Penguins jerseys. This organization wasn’t cre-
ated to confuse you. It’s just that there are so many areas that your
sports interest might take you. To accommodate the countless auc-
tions that sports aficionados, collectors, and participants, list,
eBay had to create a lot of small areas.
To keep your eyes from glazing over in awe, I’ve selected one of
the smaller categories, Art. I only say small because the number
of sub-categories can fit on one page — quite a feat these days.
Figure 11-1 shows you how Art is divided up at eBay.
Figure 11-1: Art category listings.
Part III: Searching eBay 
134
So many categories!
Argh! Why so many? The bottom line is that the system was devised to make things
easier for eBay members. The auction site started with some basic categories. Trust
me; if eBay doesn’t open up new categories to accommodate listings, you’d be com-
plaining that the listings are impossible to browse.

Figure 11-1 shows you the organized form of the main category,
Art. The numbers in parentheses next to the sub-categories is the
number of items that were up for sale in that category at the time
I made the chart — I thought you’d find that interesting, and
meaningful.
Drilling Down to Your Item
Depending on what you’re looking for, things can get confusing.
For example, say you want to find a category with items relating
to your dog (maybe even a somewhat obscure breed, like a
Schipperke) you might think you’ve got it made. I mean, how
could a category for such an esoteric breed of dog be anything
but very simple?
Schipperkes have their own category in the main category of
Collectibles at eBay. (eBay has categories for over 80 breeds of
dogs in Collectibles.) Currently there are three Schipperke items
listed in the breed’s own category. 
But there are more auctions. When I ran a title search on Schipperke,
I came up with 101 items. When I checked the little box to include
descriptions, I got 124 listings. When I followed my own advice (see
Chapter 10) and entered a search for schipperk*, I found 129 items.
When I searched for shipperke (misspelled), I found two more.
Items for Schipperke (and its misspellings) were listed in all these

I hope you realize where I’m going with all this. Even though I
picked a rather arcane item to search for, searching only through
its designated category would have impacted your search signifi-
cantly. You would have missed some of the more interesting items.
Sellers make the decision as to where they think their items should
be listed. If you ever meet me, ask me how I managed to (success-
fully, I might add) list an alcohol breath-tester key chain in the
Barbie category.
If you’re looking for a specific item, use eBay’s search. Browsing
through categories can be fun — if you have nothing special
in mind.

I
used to think (as maybe you do, too) that eBay was great for all
kinds of hand-me-downs for the family (okay, for the kids). Since
I’ve made it my own personal shopping emporium, I’ve found unbe-
lievable ways for a family to save money.
Of course, there are the obvious items. eBay allows you to get your
hands on more used merchandise than you can possibly use, and
there’s no sin in getting used merchandise for certain occasions.
But running a family provides innumerable less-obvious ways to
spend money. In this chapter I show you how to be creative and
save money at eBay.
Bringing Up Baby at eBay
Does it always seem that there’s a baby shower when you have the
least amount of time to go out and buy a present? And if you have
a lot of friends (or a lot of kids), the amount of money you can
spend on baby stuff can be astronomical.
Okay, perhaps the way I look at buying stuff for the kids at eBay
doesn’t reflect everyone’s, but there was a time when my outlook
was different. When my daughter was born, I certainly would have
loved getting a brand new crib and mattress for half the retail price

(including shipping). Actually, I think I would have gone for one of
the used, expensive Italian designer cribs at eBay — they cost up
to $700 in the real world (new), but at eBay they can be had for a
couple hundred dollars.
Cribs aren’t all you can get — just check out Figure 12-1. Here’s just
a sample of baby stuff you can find at eBay and have delivered to
your door:
 Bassinets (search the misspelling bassinete for more items!)
 Diaper bags (see Chapter 14 for diaper coupons)
 Nursery furnishings — both new and used
 Carriages and strollers
 Clothes
The truth is that adorable designer baby clothes get worn for
one picture (if you’re lucky) before being outgrown and given
away. (Or they get sold at eBay!) This fact also holds for those
basically useless but lovely silver items that we like to give as
baby gifts! You can find them brand new (in the box) selling
for about half what you’d pay in the store. 
 Baby seats
I’ve bought four top-of-the-line baby seats as gifts, and I
haven’t ever set foot in a baby store. I also had them mailed
directly to the recipients so I didn’t have to drag the big box
to the party.

Helping the Kids Through School
Whether children are in a public school, private school, or being
home schooled, they always need stuff for school. Lots and lots of
stuff! When you’re buying things, it seems like the list is endless.
The older they get, the more expensive the stuff kids need
becomes. Table 12-1 gives you an idea of just a few of the things my
daughter needed for school.
These prices do not include shipping — so be sure to check how
much the seller is charging for shipping before you bid.

chance and search!
Textbooks for home school,
high school, and college
Textbooks are the most expensive items parents purchase. Many
schools across the country have been faced with budget cuts, and
parents must buy supplemental books for their children — even if
the children attend public schools. Home schooling is becoming
increasingly popular, and of course, parents need the appropriate
books. Last of all? My daughter is in college; some of her used
books cost more than $100 each — I don’t even want to discuss the
prices of the new books!
School and college bookstores buy back students’ books at the end
of the term — maybe. Maybe, because professors may decide to
change books, or a new edition may be published. Then you’re
stuck with an expensive doorstop — er, textbook. But even if the
bookstore does buy back copies of books at the end of the term,
Chapter 12: One-Stop Shopping for Family Fun 141

the bookstore only pays you a fraction of what you paid for the
book in the first place.
Half.com
eBay acquired Half.com in July 2000. Half.com started as a person-
to-person book sale site. In true eBay style, the site began to carry
all types of items (other than books).
If you’re lazy like me, you like to do all your shopping all in one
place. Currently, you have to leave the eBay site in order to shop
for stuff from Half.com. However, eBay just announced that
Half.com will be fully integrated into the eBay platform by 2004.
When the transition is complete, the Half.com site will disappear
completely, and all the functions will be available within eBay.
I’m hoping that Half.com will remain a great way to buy books. In
the meantime, if you go to Half.com (www.half.com or click the
Half.com by eBay link under Specialty Sites on the eBay home
page) you’ll arrive at the page in Figure 12-2.
Turn over this book and look at the number above the bar code on
the back cover. That’s the ISBN (International Standard Book
Number). Every book has an ISBN number, and if you type the ISBN
number in the search box on the Half.com home page, listings for
the book appear.
Figure 12-2: The Half.com home page with an ISBN ready to search
in the book area.
Part IV: Shopping for Specific Items 
142

Get your student’s booklist and run the ISBN numbers through
Half.com (or search the title through eBay). You’ll save a bundle
on books.
The cheapest way to ship books is using Media Mail rate. Using
this method can take as long as two to four weeks to get across the
country so do your online book shopping as early as possible.
That is, unless you’re saving enough money at eBay to pay for
Priority Mail shipping!
For the junior musician
Way back in the olden days, when I was in high school, schools
supplied musical instruments for the kids in band or orchestra to
play. This is not so common an occurrence these days. Okay. I’ll be
honest: It never happens. Parents usually have to cough up an
instrument for junior to play.
I didn’t believe it myself, but eBay’s musical instruments are
cheaper (ahem, less expensive) than anywhere else on the planet.
You see, if you buy a used instrument, you don’t have to pay the
middle man. Just like books, when parents sell the old instruments
back to stores, the parents get pennies, and the stores polish up
the instruments and sell them to another customer for just below
the retail price.
Bricks-and-mortar-based music stores, like Musiqueweb (whose
saxophone is featured in Figure 12-3), have found an excellent
niche at eBay for their special instruments. Other sellers have
opened eBay stores listing hundreds of beginner’s instruments
for sale.
The eBay site is also loaded with the miscellaneous accessories
that playing an instrument requires. From sheet music and reeds to
rosin, strings, and mouthpieces, eBay is the place to look for acces-
sories, all at a discount.
I played violin in school, and I really miss it. So I recently bought a
stunning, cherry red Yamaha electric violin at eBay for 40 percent
less than I could have bought it for at the local music shop. I also
bought sheet music with CDs that play the rest of the orchestra so
that I’m not the only instrument playing. I can’t wait till I have the
time to really enjoy it!
Chapter 12: One-Stop Shopping for Family Fun 143

Figure 12-3: A saxophone even Lisa Simpson would
love to play.
Don’t forget to check out eBay Stores for your musical needs.
Simply conduct a search (see Chapters 9 and 10) and look in the
lower-left corner of the Search Results page that appears to see
related eBay stores. Search stores also from the Search page on
the Search Stores tab.
My Big, Bloated eBay Wedding
There’s not a more bloated, high-maintenance event than a wed-
ding. Where else do you face spending $1,200 for the cake alone?
The expenses for a wedding never end. Just when you think you’ve
got it all covered, you get the bill for 4 pounds of Jordan almonds
(for some reason you can’t have a wedding without ’em). When
parents face a wedding (very often just after recovering from the
college tuition nightmare) they will be very happy to know there
are major savings to be had at eBay.
Searching the Everything

Perhaps your eBay wedding can be original! When putting together
a wedding, eBay’s Wedding theme page can be a great help. You go

When I ran my wedding gown search, I was shocked to see brand
new, $1,200 wedding gowns selling at eBay for $200. That certainly
leaves plenty of your budget to have the dress altered to fit the
bride like a glove.
Wedding auction categories
You can find more than a couple of useful wedding categories at
eBay to do your shopping. Remember that the first category listed
is the main category, and it sifts down to the sub-categories:
 Clothing & Accessories➪Wedding Apparel: This category
includes shoes, accessories, bridesmaid dresses, and gowns.
 Everything Else➪Gifts & Occasions➪Wedding Supplies: This
category covers wedding cake toppers, candles, favors, flow-

It looks like an eBay wedding
I found a lot of 10 bridal gowns at eBay that were being auctioned by the Making
Memories Breast Cancer Foundation. I won all 10 gowns at a very reasonable price,
with the idea of reselling them at some point (for a healthy profit — I do have a
daughter in college, you know). These beautiful new gowns were donated to the
charity by bridal shops and manufacturers around the country — so that it could
resell them for cash. See Chapter 22 for more on great bargains that help charities.
My stepdaughter called a few weeks ago to announce that she’s getting married.
For a couple of weekends, she and her mother went from bridal shop to bridal shop
and were very frustrated — until I told her about the gowns I bought at eBay. Well,
no more worries about a bridal gown. Not only did she love one of the dresses I
picked up, but it fit her perfectly.

all-inclusive trips. These can be last-minute bargains from travel
agents (make sure that the travel agency is registered with the
(International Air Transport Association), or even from airlines.
Finding air travel bargains
You can also get bargains on air travel at eBay. Many people sell
their transferable upgrades and reward tickets. I’ve found that a
search for fare upgrade within titles and descriptions always nets a
great deal of these certificates for sale at eBay. Also, a search for
airline ticket yields lots of bargains.
Be sure if you buy an airline ticket at eBay that you ask all ques-
tions first. Are there restrictions on the ticket? An expiration date?
Blackout dates? Also, if you know which airline your ticket is for,
the deal may be safer because you can find all the airline’s rules
and regulations before placing a bid.
Many airlines say that vouchers, bonus discounts, and the like may
be transferred, but not sold. To get these items at eBay, sellers get
a bit creative. For example, the actual auction may be for an enve-
lope, but the winner will also get the airline tickets for free (see
Figure 12-5).

roundtrip ticket).

Reining in restaurant bargains
I love finding restaurant deals at eBay. I tried the idea last year for
the first time when I was planning a trip to Miami Beach. Just play-
ing around, I searched restaurant miami beach (including titles
and descriptions) and I came up with a bunch of restaurant gift
certificates. I should say off the bat that I am not a big fan of
coupons, and I always wonder about those restaurant discount
booklets, but these auctions were going so cheaply I decided that
making a bid was worth the risk.
I was going to Miami Beach for a week, so I bought six $25 gift cer-
tificates to various restaurants in the area that I was staying in. The
winning bid price for these auctions was between $4 and $8. Let
me say this again, for emphasis: I spent $4–$8 per $25 gift certifi-
cate. Basically, the way I think of it, I was being paid to eat out.
Well, I’m a believer now. Son of a gun, when I presented the certifi-
cates, each restaurant was happy and pleased to redeem them (even
the very ritziest). Restaurants.com was the seller in all my Miami
Beach restaurant coupon experiments. Currently, this eBay seller
has close to 9,000 restaurant gift certificates for sale. The certifi-
cates are wonderful for everyday use and make great gifts, as well!
Getting Disability Resources
Many families deal with the hardships that accompany a family
member’s disability or decreased mobility. Whether the disability
is the result of illness or injury, the loss of freedom can be difficult
for everyone. And items that increase mobility and quality of life
are expensive, hard to find, and, often, not covered by insurance.
eBay offers a worldwide marketplace for special items for different
disabilities.
My mother had macular degeneration. I only wish I’d had access to
the glasses sold by the seller annlarr@sympatico.ca in Figure 12-6. I
made a couple of searches to find it: “legally blind” (in titles and
descriptions) and macular before I came across this auction.

 Finding cooking supplies

 Meeting your holiday decorating needs
S
hopping at eBay for almost everything else makes sense. But
after all, how can a Web site really help organize your home?
When it’s spring time, everyone likes to go outside, and no one
wants to waste time inside on the computer! But what if you could
go out and enjoy the crisp spring air while the mailman delivers
all your spring home needs to your door?
This convenience makes even more sense in the winter. Why drive
through snow and ice from store to store to find everything you
need to make your home a more comfortable refuge?
Get Cooking!
What would eBay possibly have to share for your home life in the
cooking area? Sure, you can get some great deals on pots and pans,
but that’s just scratching the surface! I bet you’ve flipped through
a high-price kitchen appliance catalog or two in your day, and slob-
bered over some expensive must-have kitchen implement that you
figured you wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else.

Here’s a great example: I have been coveting some elegant
18/10 stainless steel professional dish racks in catalogs. These
babies sell for between $100 and $150 (not including shipping).
While writing this book, I bought one of those very fancy-looking
racks (brand new!) from an eBay seller for approximately $50 —
including shipping! (Yay!)
Well, you can find just about anything at eBay if you look hard
enough, and everything is available at a great savings. Just do a
little search at eBay for Pottery Barn or Williams Sonoma. One
recent search of mine (a simple title search for Williams Sonoma)
netted a total of 709 items. You can find everything from new com-
mercial baking pans to half-price, new hem-stitched napkins.
Items are marketed differently in different sections of the coun-
try. What goes on sale in Dallas may not go on sale in Oklahoma
City. The Dallas eBay seller may buy a bunch of an item at a deep
discount and put this sparkling new merchandise up for sale
at eBay.
Getting hard-to-find recipes
Not only is finding unique recipes a no-brainer at eBay, but if
you’re not wealthy (or not a gourmand), many recipes are inexpen-
sive and easy to prepare. 
If you search for recipes, you’ll come up with the expected number
of recipe books, but as you skim the listings you may be surprised
by what you’ll find. For example, I did a little search for recipes
grandma and came up with 355 unique items. Many were home-
made compilations of original recipes that had been passed down
through the generations.
Many sellers who use eBay as a venue put together their recipes in
an eBook format that installs easily on your computer, or type in
their recipes in a Microsoft Word file that they send electronically
(upon payment, of course) via e-mail.
I’m not talking about one or two recipes here. I’m talking about
hundreds of home cooking recipes for just a couple of dollars.
(So much for granny’s “secret” fried chicken recipe — I just bought
it at eBay for $3 along with 299 other down-home southern
recipes.)
Part IV: Shopping for Specific Items 
152

Toss the word charity into your recipe search, and you’ll be sur-
prised at the amount of cookbooks that are available from Junior
League, community organizations, and charitable organizations.
Also, finding some of the more, er, esoteric recipes is a snap. I ran a
search for French Normandy recipes. I turned up with 22 items that
varied from videos to books to eBooks. Now I know how to cook
snails. Super.
I put together a small eBook of 23 original French Normandy
recipes from a cookbook written (and published) by my great aunt
in England. Buyers just get the file via e-mail, and it installs on their
computer. Twenty-three great recipes delivered to your mailbox for
only $5 — not too shabby! (Check out Figure 13-1.)
Finding foodie faves fast
As part of my research for this chapter, I ordered two 18-inch New
York–style pizzas from an eBay seller. (The sacrifices I make for my
readers!) The seller was auctionsflyingpizzas. This seller just opened
an eBay store, and it already has impeccable feedback. The pizzas
were packaged uniquely and arrived within a day. When put in
the oven and resuscitated, they were admittedly, the best cheese
pizzas my family had tasted. What a fun thing to send someone
as a gift!
Figure 13-1: Aunt Maureen’s abridged cookbook at eBay — 
sans escargots.
Chapter 13: Finding Home and Garden Bargains 153

The pizzas I got from auctionsflyingpizzas weren’t the first food
items I got through eBay. I’m absolutely hooked on the chocolate
truffle bars sold by seller rejinsf (see Figure 13-2). These babies
are absolutely delicious and fresh. I’ve sent these truffles as gifts
to friends (and gobbled them up with my family at home).
Figure 13-2: Custom chocolate truffle bars for $9.95.
Many gourmet cooks who also happen to be computer-savvy 
entrepreneurs have begun to sell their specialties at eBay. With the
advent of overnight and second-day shipping, many home-made,
gourmet items can arrive at your door fresh and delicious. The
best part is that you can read the feedback about what the food
item tastes like before you order — I never would have tried the
cabernet-wine soaked fruit cake last Christmas if I hadn’t!
Also, if you know anyone who is a cookie freak — try searching
your favorite cookies at eBay! I love snicker doodles (light, crisp
cinnamon cookies) and found some at eBay by a blue-ribbon chef,
wsenterprises. I checked the feedback and ordered (see Figure 13-3)
some incredible cookies! The dee-lish cookies arrived in a day or
so, and were packed beautifully — not one was broken. (The seller
used air-popped popcorn in the box!) Think of these food items for
birthday and special occasion gifts as well as for yourself!
Part IV: Shopping for Specific Items 
154

Figure 13-3: Yummy, fresh cookies, baked to order.
If you travel and discover some regional or international food that
you love, check eBay when you’re back stateside. I came back from
Jamaica and was hooked on Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee. Much
to my chagrin, this coffee retails for about $30 a pound! After a
quick search, I found that I can easily purchase the same coffee at
eBay for half that amount!
Finding food coupons
Do you go through the Sunday newspaper looking for coupons so
that you can save on your weekly groceries? Of course you do —
you love a bargain or you wouldn’t be reading this book. Well,
you’re not alone — coupons are used every day to save money in
the bricks-and-mortar grocery stores.
Wouldn’t it be great to have as many coupons as you want for expen-
sive items that you frequently use? See figure 13-4. A small number
of knowledgeable eBay sellers buy multiple copies of local newspa-
pers, cut out the original manufacturer’s coupons, and put them
up for sale on the site. Note that I used the search engine trick, by
searching for (coupon, coupons).
Chapter 13: Finding Home and Garden Bargains 155

Figure 13-4: Over 6,000 sales for coupons — if you use 
’em — here they are!
As Seen on TV
If you see a super kitchen item on TV (it slices, it dices, but wait,
there’s more), and you think you’d like to purchase it at a savings,
run a search at eBay.
When you purchase from a seller at eBay — you may not only be
saving money, you’ll be protected by eBay’s fraud protection pro-
gram. Something you’re not likely to have when you call a 1-800
number you see in an ad at 2:00 a.m. on TV.
I just ran a search for popeil (Ron Popeil is the self-appointed king
of stuff nobody needs, and the inventor of the Pocket Fisherman,
Ronco PastaMaker, the Showtime Rotisserie, Hair-in-a-Can, and
hundreds more “must-have” items) at eBay and discovered 
two things:
 Some eBay sellers can’t spell: I found 81 items while search-
ing for popeil and 8 while searching for popiel.
 Misspellings aren’t all bad: Nobody was bidding on the mis-
spelled items, and savvy shoppers can get some incredible
deals.
Part IV: Shopping for Specific Items 
156

A search for ronco (the name of the company he founded)
netted another 121 items that never mentioned Popeil.
If you’re looking for a new item that is currently being advertised
through commercials and infomercials, add TV to your search
phrase. That way you can weed out similar items that are made by
different manufacturers. A search for as seen on tv currently
returns 1,724 items. When looking for these items, beware of low
Buy It Now prices — they usually go hand in hand with high ship-
ping charges.
Finding Outdoor Supplies
on the Cheap
Getting your summer happening is a cinch at eBay. You can always
find great bargains on pool supplies, patio furniture, and (espe-
cially in the winter) patio heaters. When I’ve searched for such
items at eBay, I’ve found prices that (even including shipping
costs) can beat my prices at the local discount store.
Keeping your green thumb happy
You no longer have to find a special nursery to find rare and
unique plants. Just read your landscaping book and run a search at
eBay for the plants you want. You can find almost every exotic
plant you desire. Here’s a lay of the land:
 Horticulturists from the Pacific Northwest are selling seeds
and flats of their cherished lavender and herbs.
 A nursery in Indiana, rosemeadownursery, specializes in minia-
ture roses, and is selling them by the dozen for spring. I ordered
five, and they arrived packed so carefully it was amazing.
 Sellers from Hawaii are selling cuttings and seeds from those
luscious Hawaiian plants.
I have bought some unique plants at eBay, including a dwarf
Cavendish banana, a dwarf pomegranate and a plumeria (frangipani)
cutting from Hawaii. Last year, I grew Atlantic giant pumpkins (to the
delight of the kids in the neighborhood at Halloween time) and now
can find the seeds for this very special pumpkin at eBay this year!
Chapter 13: Finding Home and Garden Bargains 157

There are rules for nurseries that ship to different states. Some
states require bare root shipping. The seller removes all dirt from
the plant roots and ships the plant in a moisture-laden container.
California, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah and Arizona have
special plant rules. More information can be found on the eBay
help page: http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/plantsand

The Green Dragon Chair Company
To me, few things are more comfortable than sitting outside on a spring day on one
of those incredibly comfortable Adirondack chairs. You can find lots of those chairs
at eBay, but the Green Dragon Chair Company (represented by seller, jrousch00) is
special. It sells a pre-sanded, partially assembled pine chair kit. All you need to do
is use simple hand tools to put the chair together, and when you’re done you can
paint or stain the chair according to your preference. The Green Dragon also gives
you a lovely color coffee cup to commemorate your purchase.
The Green Dragon is the mascot for Lake Placid High School in Florida, and the
chairs are the brainchild of instructor John Rousch to raise funds for the school
shop program. Putting together the chair kits gives students the opportunity to use
power tools and shop machines, use layout and design techniques, do shop math,
learn craftsmanship, and develop teamwork. 
Mr Rousch teaches more than woodcraft production; the students get a taste for
marketing, distribution, price points, and everything else you can think of that is
associated with running a business. Mr. Rousch doesn’t believe in working his stu-
dents without rewarding them, either. Every time the kids sell 50 chairs, he throws
a pizza party.

Swimming pool equipment
Yes, eBay has its share of 6-foot inflatable alligators, water wings,
underwater exercisers, and swimming-pool basketball sets. But
eBay is also an excellent place to save money on swimming pool
equipment and parts.
Anyone who has ever used a mechanical pool sweep knows that
they are pretty temperamental items, and you need to work on
them from time to time. There are sellers at eBay who sell brand
new replacement parts for these pool monsters at a major savings
from your local pool store.
Pool equipment of all kinds, including test equipment and supplies,
can be found at lower-than-discount prices.
Calling all sports
One of the best aspects of getting involved in a sport is buying all
the stuff you need to perform the sport looking your best. You can,
of course, find individual sellers devoted to all your sporting
needs, but eBay also has complete stores devoted to sports, as
well. eBay covers everything you need, whether you are a partici-
pant or merely a fan. You won’t find better bargains anywhere.
You can look for everything from camping equipment, to paintball
supplies, and even curling. (Yes, curling.) When it comes to golf, I
know that my lousy game isn’t half as lousy when I look good, and I
can find lots of things that I need at eBay.
You may want to rent (or buy) a timeshare for your vacation. If you
want to practice your game, you might want books and videos or
get practice nets and putting greens for your home or office. See
how a theme is put together? You also might want golf memorabilia
(a Tiger Woods 1996 Rookie card, PSA 10, is worth $37,000), auto-
graphs, perhaps even a pair of tickets to the Ryder Cup or the
Masters.
Themes can be a very valuable way to get what you want at eBay.
See how we use themes in Chapter 12 to put together a wedding!
I was totally blown away when I saw pool tables for sale at eBay!
zBilliards has been selling full-size billiard tables at eBay for a few
years. He originally got interested in using eBay in his business
when he saw his mother’s collectible business turn from pretty
good to a pretty big money maker with a little help from eBay. 
Chapter 13: Finding Home and Garden Bargains 159

Adam Ginsberg is the man behind zBilliards. (Check out one of his
auctions in Figure 13-5.) He contracted directly with overseas fac-
tories to produce the tables according to his own exacting specifi-
cations (talk about branding!). He imports the tables directly and
keeps them in his Los Angeles warehouse.
I’ve seen tables sell at eBay for as low as $710, and a quick glance
at the feedback rating tells me that Ginsberg has plenty of happy
customers. Many of the feedbacks also reflect comments by the
installers that the tables bought from Ginsberg were half (or even
one-third) the local purchase price.
Figure 13-5: An auction from zBilliards begins at $1, and many 
tables sell with no reserve.

Shopping themes for golf
eBay goes the distance to use related items to put together themes. The categories
can get fairly narrow. But themes are put together with items from many categories
with a related theme. Like when you’re looking for things for golf, many things go into
that theme. Find the eBay Golf theme page at http://pages.ebay.com/promo/
golf. On this page, eBay gives close to a hundred links related to the world of golf.
You can buy golf clubs (like woods, irons, and putters), balls, and other equipment
(like bags, carts, stands, umbrellas, and divot tools). You can also buy clothing to
wear while you play golf (gloves, shirts, and shoes), and you can bid to book tee
times at golf courses around the country.

Holiday Fun and Decor
It doesn’t take a whole lot of creative thinking to realize that eBay
has to be the home for tons of ultra-cool holiday chic. Where else
do you think you can find old-fashioned electric revolving color
wheels for sale? There’s quite a market for early-1960s aluminum
Christmas trees! The eBay venue is one of the few places where
you can actually have your pick of 6-foot pom-pom aluminum trees!
There may be a great market for ornaments and holiday col-
lectibles, but what about the more common decorations, like
wreaths and trees. Yes, Virginia, you can buy your Christmas tree
at eBay (see Figure 13-6).
Finally, Christmas tree farmers have a venue of their own. No
longer do they have to hack down their best trees and sell them to
wholesalers that truck the trees across the country. Farmers are
keeping their Grade #1 trees (according to National Christmas Tree
Association standards) and selling them at eBay. Your tree will be
hand-picked and babied all year, and cut just for you when you
place your order at eBay.

plus shipping (shipping $25)? Check out auctions from jbeffel.
My Christmas tree is coming from eBay from now on. I’m tired of
walking through lots and seeing trees that are already semi-crispy.
I want a fresh tree and wreath straight from the farm!

Chapter 14
Finding Digital and
Industrial Bargains
In This Chapter
 Getting a steal on electronics
 Getting DVDs, videos, and CDs for less
 Getting industrial equipment
O
ne of the first things sold at eBay was founder Pierre
Omidyar’s broken down laser pointer. I guess that qualifies
as the first “electronic” item sold on the site. Today electronics —
for home and business use — are some of the most popular items
on the site. Here’s a chapter about everything you knew you could
get at eBay — I’m sure that you had no idea how much there
really is.
I can’t possibly go through every interesting type of item sold in this
category, so go visit the Electronics hub page (see Figure 14-1). You
can get there from the link on the eBay home page or go directly to
http://pages.ebay.com/catindex/catelectronics.html)
where eBay has links to all the varied electronics subcategories.
You will also find loads of factory-refurbished items here among
the new and used. For more information on refurbished items,
check out Chapter 17.

Figure 14-1: The eBay Electronics hub.
Finding Home Electronics at eBay
Home electronics encompasses a wide amount of merchandise
that eBay puts in the category of Electronics and Computers. The
subcategories in Electronics and Computers are varied, and they
include many of my favorites.
An important caveat here: If you’re not familiar with certain brands
or technologies, I suggest you study up before you jump in to shop
for higher-end electronics such as computers and peripherals.
Know what you want, know what options are important to you, and
know what you want to do with the electronics you’re thinking
about bidding on. Here are some additional tips to keep in mind:
 Check current street prices at www.dealtime.com.
 Get reviews on how other people judged the items you’re
looking at from www.epinions.com.
 Read reviews from the pros at www.beststuff.com (see
Figure 14-2).
If you’re anything like me, this category covers the gear you use,
and always want to upgrade. eBay sellers sell these items at such a

to toys.
discount that you can afford an extra serving of the special niceties
of life! Heck, you’re not alone — $10 million a day gets spent on
electronics alone at eBay. Below are some of the main subcate-
gories of merchandise in this category.
PDAs
PDA stands for personal digital assistant. These devices are the
ever-popular Palms and Windows Pocket PC devices. But wait,
there’s more: eBay is loaded with (currently over 25,000) the latest
and greatest PDAs, with auctions for Compaq iPaq, Sony Clie,
Hewlett Packard Jornada, and more.
The best part about this category is that if you can’t afford to be
the absolutely cutting edge. If you can’t get the top-of-the-line,
latest designs, you can get super deals on last year’s technology.
(Last year’s technology is just fine with me!)
I got my PDA at eBay and I got my daughter’s last two PDAs at
eBay. (My husband still has an address book and is proud of it!) We
got all the accessories we needed; extra styli, cleaners, and even a
keyboard. I purchased elegant leather Dooney & Burke (very high-
style) cases for the Palm PDAs for under $10 each.
Chapter 14: Finding Digital and Industrial Bargains 165

Phones and wireless devices
You’re no longer at the mercy of your cellular company when it
comes to buying accessories for your phones. At eBay the items
are a good deal cheaper than the mall kiosks and retailers. You can
afford to get all the chargers and faceplates you want for your
phones at lower-than-low prices.
Portable audio
Here you will find the newest items, and many that are factory
refurbished. This is a great category to go to for holiday gifts as
the savings are amazing here, especially in the new MP3 players!
Computers and Office Gear
When it comes to computers and computer accessories — eBay is
number one. New and used units can be found at low, low discount
prices. The big computer stores may be able to buy at lower prices,
but they pay a higher overhead, so the discounts rarely get passed
down to consumers. (Even though a few of the name-brand com-
puter companies have their own stores at eBay.)
There are top-of-the-line computers at eBay (sold by sellers with
excellent feedback) for hundreds of dollars less than retail stores.
Many include warranties and provide telephone tech support from
the manufacturer.
Even if you don’t get your computers here, you’d be foolish not
to get your ink cartridges and computer accessories here. Small
businesses are doing land office business at eBay selling inkjet
and laser printer consumables and specialty papers. You just can’t
find these items anywhere else at these prices! Check out the deal
in Figure 14-3. This is a high-quality printer that’s been refurbished
(and includes a warranty) and could run a small business for 
years!
Here’s a list of other home computing supplies you can find great
deals on:
 Blank CDs: I’ll bet you need blank CDs for backing up your
files and for making musical compilations for, um, personal
use. Match the prices you find at eBay with the local super-
store, and you’ll be having them delivered to your door.
Part IV: Shopping for Specific Items 
166

 Software: New software comes out, and the prices seem to get
more expensive every year. Stock of old versions of the soft-
ware may end up with the liquidators — and liquidators can
unload perfectly good, unregistered software at eBay for a
fraction of the price you’d pay for new programs. 
Older software versions may not have all the bells and whis-
tles of the new software, but it may just handle what you need.
See more of what eBay has for business later in this chapter.
Home audio, video, and 
photo equipment
In addition to small sellers, you’ll find many major retailers selling
their excess inventory here. You’ll find home theater systems, VCRs,
DVDs, and everything else you need and never have to leave home
again.
If you know where to look, the bargains in this area can be signifi-
cant; a friend of mine just bought an outdated Bose home theater
sound system for a fraction of the original retail price. Kind of like
a Rolls Royce, the old Bose is better than many of the new, less-
expensive systems that are for sale nowadays!
Figure 14-3: This Hewlett Packard printer sold from Prefixtech at 
eBay for only $305!
Chapter 14: Finding Digital and Industrial Bargains 167

You can also get some sweet deals on digital still and digital video
cameras. You can always find new and refurbished merchandise
from business sellers, of course. But you can also find auctions for
used (and perfectly good) cameras from people who are upgrading
to new technology. If you don’t mind staying one step behind, you
can get some great deals!
Recorded Home Entertainment
If having a library of all the great movies is your goal, eBay is the
place to go, and buying used can offer amazing savings. In 
Chapter 13, I told you about buying textbooks from the eBay-
owned Half.com. You can do the same with CDs, DVDs and videos.
At Half.com, just search for your media by title or keywords.

Be protected with an eBay warranty
If you worry about buying electronics at eBay — don’t! You can purchase a war-
ranty for almost any new, used, or refurbished electronic product you buy for per-
sonal use. (If the product is used or refurbished, it must be less than 5 years old.)
The warranty is supplied by the NEW (National Electronics Warranty Corporation)
Service group exclusively through eBay and covers
 One year of product protection 
 100 percent coverage on parts and labor costs (and no deductible) 
 24/7 toll-free customer service
 “No Lemon” coverage — if the item requires more than three repairs, it’s
replaced
 Protection against power surges 
You can extend a manufacturer’s warranty that comes with a new product or buy a
warranty for an item you buy. The warranty begins 30 days after the end date of the
sale. Offers like this usually sound too good to be true, but this one isn’t. The cost 
of the warranty is very reasonable and is based on what you pay for the item. 
For example, you can extend the warranty on a $4,000 plasma TV for only $299.99.
For more details, visit http://pages.ebay.com/help/warranty/
buyer_overview.html.

To find the listings at eBay, click Movies & DVDs in the category
list on the eBay home page, or go to http://pages.ebay.com/
catindex/movies.html.
Don’t assume all you are going to find here are used disks — you’ll
find brand new, shrink wrapped disks and videos at low prices —
and the selection is better than at most stores. 
If you’re looking for family-oriented videos, you can snap up
libraries of discontinued videos from parents whose children have
outgrown them!
Buying Goods for Business 
Aside from all the bargains you can find in the computer and soft-
ware areas, there’s an amazing wealth of business products at
eBay. eBay “officially” opened its business area in January 2003,
but savvy business buyers have successfully used the site as a
venue for this type of transaction for years.
The category started small and grew under eBay’s radar, reaching
today’s 500,000 listings a week. Now you can not only get there
from eBay’s home page, but it has its own address: 
http://pages.ebay.com/catindex/business.html
You’ll find the “official” eBay Business hub at www.ebay
business.com (see Figure 14-4).

Chapter 14: Finding Digital and Industrial Bargains 169

If you think that the cost of shipping furniture will negate any sav-
ings you might get from buying at eBay, think again. The wildly
popular Aeron chair by Herman Miller is often sold at eBay. You
can buy it new for about a third of its retail value (and that
includes shipping); you can buy a used Aeron chair for even less.
Here’s a list of typical items I found when I took a look:
 A two-ton “12 SEER” (whatever that means) brand-name air
conditioner sold for $202.50 (repossessed, never used)
 A pallet of 27,000 #000 Bubble Mailers from the eBay store,
GraMur Supply Co (those had a nice Buy It Now price of
$2,686.90)
 A new, royal 600SC cash register with a bar code scanner —
what a bargain at $225
 A 6-foot-long refrigerated deli display case sold for $499
Finding Goods by Industry
The eBay community has established true vertical industry mar-
ketplaces. Don’t believe me? Examine the site, and you will see
equipment and supplies for the following industries:
 Construction
 Medical
 Commercial printing
 Restaurant and food service
 Test and measurement
I think you get the picture. . . .
My point? Sellers at eBay are filling the needs of traditional bricks-
and-mortar businesses. eBay has come full circle from a personal
shopping site to a professional supply site.
I have many friends in varied lines of commerce who ask me to
help them buy very specialized items that are used in their indus-
try. This isn’t a PR spin. It’s a real movement in fulfillment for
industrial needs. Take a look at some of the eBay stores that sell
industrial goods. See Figure 14-5 for the Reliable Tools store.

How eBay buyers get lower prices
Early in 2000, I took a bet that I couldn’t sell a concrete pump at eBay. For those of
you who aren’t familiar with this piece of equipment, it is the gizmo that concrete
goes through when it comes out of that big truck and goes into the hose. Concrete
pumps are expensive items, and I would assume it’s fairly expensive to keep them
in stock. 
I went to the manufacturer’s representative and found out how much the pumps
usually sell for. I asked the rep if he could help me estimate shipping costs, and he
said fine. I had to list the concrete pump twice (the first time it didn’t sell), but with
the second listing it sold. Best of all, the buyer lived near the factory and also saved
by picking up the pump!
Realize that any seller can do this — be it selling cars, concrete pumps, or com-
puters. Much of the expense that retailers bear in selling high-ticket items is in keep-
ing the merchandise around (and waiting to recoup their money). Many eBay sellers
sell items in this very same manner. The manufacturer gets the price and because
the seller has very little overhead, he or she can be happier with a lower profit per-
centage than a retailer that sells the items.
By the way, the winner paid $4,000 below retail, and I made a cool $1,500 for 
my efforts.

When the eBay business site was launched, eBay let me know
about a machine shop in Gainesville, Georgia. The shop, called
DDTI, was a small business that got the bulk of its start-up
equipment at eBay. DDTI’s president purchased welders, drill
presses, laboratory equipment, sensors, electrical enclosure
valves and fittings, computer systems and a 10-ton, roof-mounted
air conditioner.
The burgeoning business owner spent $100,000 on equipment for
his business startup — a saving of approximately $750,000 off of
manufacturers’ list prices. What a great way to begin a business
with top equipment and not ending up in debt.

T
he great thing about eBay is that it lets you shop for
whatever you want, whenever you want, and however
you want. No other auction venue offers the versatility of
specialty sites like Half.com and Sotheby’s.com, the
immense selection of eBay stores (which allow sellers to
sell items in a more traditional online retail format), the
convenience of shopping regionally, and the value of shop-
ping for closeouts. The chapters here show you what you
need to know to shop smart while exploring eBay’s nooks
and crannies.

E
ven though each and every one of eBay’s categories (and
themes as well) is its own specialty site, eBay runs a few bona
fide specialty sites — that is, sites that are actually separate. You
can miss a bunch of great deals if you ignore these side sites of
eBay.
Half.com is a very successful specialty site of eBay. You can pur-
chase anything and everything there, but it does a great job for
buying media: books, CDs, DVDs and videos. It will become part
of the eBay site in 2004. Learn more about shopping there in
Chapter 13.
eBay’s site search may not reveal all the bargains listed in these
nooks ’n’ crannies, so read on and get the goodies.
Shopping eBay Stores
eBay stores are the secret weapon for knowledgeable eBay shop-
pers. First, of course, you can consistently find great deals. But you
can also help small businesses make it against larger behemoths.
Sellers open eBay stores to make searching merchandise easier for
buyers; stores also help save sellers money because sellers don’t
need to set up private e-commerce Web sites. Translation? Sellers
can list items in their eBay stores for even lower fees, thereby
passing their savings on to you, the savvy bargain hunter.

Before you buy any item from a sale at eBay, check to see if the
seller has the small, red stores icon next to his or her User ID. If so,
be sure to click the icon before you bid on the item. Most sellers
run auctions for items to draw people into their eBay stores, where
you may be able to purchase the exact same item you’re about to
bid on — for a lower amount.
You can find the eBay Stores hub from the eBay home page by
clicking the eBay Stores link under the Specialty Sites heading.
You can also get there by typing in the Web address, www.ebay
stores.com. The eBay Stores hub is shown in Figure 15-1.
On the eBay Stores hub you’ll see a small group of six store logos
in the center of the page. These store logos change every few min-
utes as eBay rotates its anchor stores through the area. Store owners
pay a considerable amount to have their stores listed as anchor
stores. (If you’re unfamiliar with the anchor store concept, think of
it as the high-rent district of eBay stores. When you go to the mall,
the big department stores like Macy’s or Bloomingdale’s are the
anchor stores.)
Below the store logos is a list of clickable links to stores. These are
featured stores. You guessed it; this place has a higher real estate
value than a regular eBay store.

You can find more stores, including the smallest ones — the cot-
tage industry sellers — by clicking one of the stores’ categories
links on the left side of the page.
Searching the stores
eBay stores cannot be searched through the same search engine
you use to search for eBay auction items, but that doesn’t mean
your search options are limited. In fact, you can find your items in
eBay stores through several methods. One way is by clicking the
Sales icon next to a seller’s User ID. The following sections offer
you a couple more search options.
A clue in regular eBay Search
When you run a regular search for an item at eBay, you’ll see a
column of yellow boxes of links on the left side of the results page.
If you scroll down to the bottom of the More at eBay area, you see
links to eBay stores that may carry the item you are looking for, as
shown in Figure 15-2.
Figure 15-2: Look for this heading 
to find related stores when you do 
a typical search for auction items.
The links that are listed may not show all the stores that carry
your item, but if you’re lucky, they’ll get you started.
Searching through eBay’s Search page
When you click the box in eBay’s Navigation Bar that takes you
to the Search area, you see a Search Stores tab. Click this tab to
visit the Search Stores page (see Figure 15-3).
Chapter 15: Getting Particular with Specialty Sites 177

Figure 15-3: Searching stores from the eBay Search page.
If you want details on how each of the search modifiers on this
page work, take a look at Chapter 10. Just remember that when you
search stores from the Search Stores tab of the eBay search, you’ll
be searching stores alone. You must search eBay separately from
the Advanced Search or the Search tab of this area.
On the Search Stores tab, you can search stores in the exact area
you would perform the auction search, from the Search tab. Also
added is the option (in case you remember all or part of a seller’s
store name) is a Search for Stores by Store Name box. (This option
also lets you search the store description.) Just type as much as
you can remember of the store name (in the case of my store, just
enter my last name, collier and a word from my store description,
dummies), click Search Stores, and you’ll be presented with a list
of store names that match your search.
Searching from the eBay Stores hub page
If you look back at Figure 15-1, you’ll see a Search Stores box on
the left-hand side of the page. You have a couple of options when
you search from this page:
Part V: Specialty Shopping 
178

 Click in the Search Buy It Now Items box: The search engine
goes through all the items listed in all the eBay stores to find
your selected keywords in the item title. (Searching eBay
stores from the eBay search page allows you to search both
item titles and item descriptions in stores.)
 Click the Search Store Name and Description button: The
store search engine will search only the store names, and the
brief store description posted by the seller.
Browsing eBay stores
Looking back on Figure 15-1, below the search box, you’ll see a cat-
egory listing that’s similar to the one on the eBay home page. The
only difference is that when you click these categories, you’re
browsing eBay stores by category — and not the rest of the eBay
auction categories. Each category has a home page very similar to
the Stores hub page (see Figure 15-4).
The main category of the eBay Stores page shown in Figure 15-4 is
Clothing & Accessories. When you look at the left side of this page,
you can view the store’s subcategories.
When you click a subcategory (such as Women) you are able to
view the subcategory pages. Figure 15-5 shows the Women subcat-
egory of the Clothing & Accessories category. 
Figure 15-4: The eBay Stores Clothing & Accessories category.

You’ll note that on the left side, even more subcategories are listed.
Right down the center of the page is a listing of all stores in the
Women subcategory. The stores are listed in descending order; the
stores with the most items are at the top of the list, and the stores
with the fewest are at the end.
Checking Out an eBay Store
When you finally arrive at the eBay store of your choice, you’ll see
a page that looks similar to the one in Figure 15-6. An eBay store
not only lists the items that the seller has listed in the store, but
also every active auction or Buy It Now item the seller has placed
on the eBay site. 
All eBay stores have four clickable tabs: 
 Store items: The home page of the store. 
 Feedback: The seller’s feedback.
 Store policies: The terms and conditions of the seller’s 
auctions.
 About the store: The seller’s About Me page (see Chapter 5
for more on About Me pages).

corner, you’ll see the eBay Stores logo. A click here brings you
to the eBay stores home page.
 eBay Navigation Bar: I told you that you can’t get rid of this;
the eBay Navigation Bar also appears at the top of every eBay
store page.
 The store name: The name the store owner has chosen for
the store. The store name helps you remember the Web
address. Each eBay store has its own address that ends in the
eBay store’s name, like this: www.stores.ebay.com/insert
storename. For example, my store’s URL is www.stores.
ebay.com/marshacolliersfabulousfinds.com.
 Seller’s User ID and feedback rating: Below the store name,
next to Maintained by is the seller’s User ID. And of course,
the ubiquitous feedback rating.
 Add to my Favorite Stores: If you click this link, the store is
added to your My eBay Favorites page on your My eBay area.

when you search Stores by Store Name and Description.)
 Store categories: eBay store owners may assign their own
custom categories to the items they sell to better organize
things within the store. You may click on individual categories
to see items in that classification for that seller.
eBay Live Auctions and
Sothebys.com
When it comes to special items, this is the place to go. From the
eBay home page, take a look at the links on the right. At the very top
of the column of links is a link to Sothebys.com. At the very bottom
of the category link is a link to Live Auctions.
Ladies, you don’t have to put on diamond jewelry and get all
dressed up to attend these auctions. And gentlemen, black tie is
not necessary. As a matter of fact, you can now bid against the
Vanderbilts from your home in your jammies and fuzzy slippers.
Champagne and caviar hors d’oeuvres are optional.
In these areas, you and I can bid on the most high-profile auctions
from around the world at the world’s most famous auction houses.
If you don’t want to bid, you can use the viewing function where
you can watch the bidding on your screen in real time with the
auction house floor, by indicating (during or just before the live
auction) on the site that you’d like to just watch the action. All the
software is in your browser — you need nothing special.
When you bid in live auctions, whether on Sothebys.com or at
eBay Live Auctions, you will no doubt be required to pay a buyer’s
premium. A buyer’s premium is an amount, added to the winner’s
final bid, which goes to the auction house. The premium usually
runs between 15 and 20 percent of the final sale price. Before you
sign up for the auction, be sure to read all the terms and condi-
tions of the auctioneer and factor this extra charge into your high-
est bidding price before you even consider placing a bid.
When you come to the home page of the individual live auctions,
be sure to click the link to View All Lots. That way you can see all
of the items up for sale in the individual auctions. That’s how you’ll
find the unseen gem.

You don’t have to be at your computer at the time of the auction to
participate. You can place an absentee bid for the item on the auc-
tion page, and the bid is placed in your name by the auction house
when the item comes up for bidding. Sometimes you may think you
can’t afford these great items, but many times items do go for low
bids. You can’t win if you don’t play, so if you see something you
really want bid. You just might win it.
eBay Live Auctions
The Live Auctions area of the eBay site is one of the most exciting
places to visit, especially during an auction. If you look in this area,
you’ll have the opportunity to bid or watch an auction in live
action (as shown in Figure 15-7) on some of the finest and most
unique items in the world. I have personally spent many a fun
afternoon with the smallest dream that I might be able to bid with
the big boys on some of these special auctions. 
Major auction houses from around the world run online auctions
here at eBay, and every item up for sale is covered by traditional
live auction guarantees. On the Live Auctions home page

I
think by now you’re probably convinced that eBay’s a great
place to shop for almost anything. Picture this: You’re at home
or at work, and suddenly you remember that the day after tomor-
row is one of the following:
a) Your boss’s birthday
b) Your sister-in-law’s anniversary
c) Your nephew’s graduation
There isn’t a moment in your schedule for an extended shopping
trip, and you don’t dare call your spouse because she pulled you
out of the last disaster. eBay can come to the rescue — without
exorbitant express shipping charges!
Even items that you wouldn’t think you could buy at eBay because
their size would cause prohibitive shipping charges (anyone look-
ing for a piano?) are available at eBay. If you’re worried about the
shipping costs, don’t be. eBay is one step ahead of you.
If you click on the Browse box on the eBay Navigation Bar, a drop-
down sub-menu appears (see Figure 16-1). Click Regions for a
pleasant surprise.

Figure 16-1: The eBay Regions page.
eBay’s Local Trading Zones
Here’s the place where eBay brings the world’s marketplace closer
to your hometown. The geography whizzes at eBay narrowed down
the United States into 60 shopping regions. Whenever a seller posts
an item at eBay, he or she is asked to indicate the regional trading
area that’s closest to home. This marks the auction for the eBay
computers.
When you arrive at the local trading page, scroll down the page
and find the metropolitan area closest to your home, it draws that
piece of information from the item listing. Find the city of your
choice and click it, and you’ll find your own mini, local eBay!
Regional is just a means of displaying auction results.
Shopping for large items
The eBay Web site is not just the best place to look for small easily
shippable items, but it’s also great for bigger items. By shopping
the region near your home, you’ll be able to get some real bargains
Part V: Specialty Shopping 
188

on large items that you’d probably never find any other way. No
newspaper or penny-shopper can show you beautiful color pic-
tures like you can see at eBay.
Recently there have been a group of sellers who sell large items
like furniture — and even pool tables on the site — that offer ship-
ping at no extra charge. Be sure to use the search term free ship-
ping to see what kinds of results you come up with.
Home furnishings online
If you’re looking for exquisite collectible antique furniture, this is the
place. There’s everything from Rococo to Chippendale to Eames,
and I’ll bet you can find something special close to your home.
You can find new furniture, too. In fact, I’ve seen furniture stores
selling samples at eBay. You never know what will be up for sale on
any given day.
You can find lots of lower-end and used furniture, too. Handy
people can find vintage upholstered goods ready for refurbishing.
Young people starting out can decorate an entire apartment or
home right from eBay at bargain basement prices — and they can
do their shopping together from their computer! 
The average eBay auction lasts for seven days. You may not find
just what you’re looking for the moment you look for it. Check back
once or twice a week to find your treasure. Better yet, set up a
recurring search on your My eBay Favorites page, and arrange for
eBay to e-mail you when it finds the item up for sale. For details on
how to set this up, see Chapter 4. 
Major appliances
One of the most amazing things that I’ve found at eBay is in the
category of home appliances. As I’m writing, I just browsed
through the category. If you want to get a gently used (but func-
tioning) refrigerator, stove, washing machine, or dryer you have
many to choose from. It’s a perfect place to find items for people
staring out.
For a collector, there was an absolutely immaculate 1950s
Fridgidaire stove that looked like the one from the I Love Lucy TV
series. I can just see Lucy serving Ricky a plate of eggs from it. It
was selling for $175 to someone in Texas. I don’t know what I
would do with it, but it was sure beautiful. But, I digress . . .
Chapter 16: Shopping Close to Home 189

Try conducting a search on top-quality, brand-name items like
Wolf, Sub-Zero, Gaggenau, and Viking. You may discover that all
these brands are available on the site, but maybe not in your area.
Keep checking. You’ll find new items, old items, all in various con-
ditions ranging from slightly used to very used.
Finding Events, Tickets,
and Experiences
I am very glad that I discovered the Tickets & Experiences area of
eBay. I’m always the one who forgets to buy tickets to the hot play
or concert in town until two weeks before it opens. Of course, by
that time, the event is either sold out or the only seats available
are single seats at different ends of the nose-bleed section. Once
more, eBay saved my bacon.
Many people I know have a queasy feeling about buying tickets
from someone who lists tickets for sale in the newspaper — are
the tickets stolen? You have to meet these strangers somewhere,
and they only want cash. Then there are always ticket brokers,
who mark the price of their tickets up so high that they are unaf-
fordable for the average person (that’s me).
At eBay, regular people (with feedback ratings) in your area are
selling tickets all the time. Some may have bought tickets way in
advance and realize now that they’re not able to go to the event.
Others may have bought tickets for friends who didn’t come up
with the money. Or perhaps they may have stood in the line when
the tickets went on sale to make a little profit; they’re true eBay
entrepreneurs.
If you go to the category list on the left side of eBay’s home page
and click the Tickets link, the Tickets hub appears, as shown in
Figure 16-2. You can also go directly to http://pages.ebay.com/
catindex/ticketsexperience.html.
On the Ticket Hub page, the first thing you’ll find is the convenient
Product Finder. It’s a quick and easy way to find special events in
your area. You can customize your search through drop-down
boxes. Table 16-1 shows you the product finder selection options.

Of course, you should select the state where you want to attend
the event; doing so changes the drop-down box next to the state’s
name so that it contains the major cities (regions) in the state you
chose. Select the city in which you would like to attend the event.
Below, select the month, year, number of tickets and minimum and
maximum ticket price (I suggest giving a wide range of prices here)
you are looking for; click Find.
Chapter 16: Shopping Close to Home 191

If you’re just looking for a good time, you can leave out any of the
specifications in your search. Let’s say you have no idea what’s
going on in town — you’d just like to go out and do something. Just
leave the event selection as Any, put in your city, month and year
and see what pops up! Instant fun. Who knew Phish was in town?
Ticket sales are regulated by state laws. eBay follows the specific
rules, so if you live in Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island or
South Carolina, you’ll have to observe certain restrictions. To see all
the legalese, go to http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/
png-tickets.html.
Below the Product finder, you’ll find the subcategories that also
include Experiences. Experiences are often packages that include
travel, or can be “one-of-a-kind” events. Some of the current one-of-
a-kind items include hot air balloon rides, tours of old mines, and
trips to go mining for gold. You can also find Disney travel pack-
ages, Iditarod race lodging, meals, and other activities. You get the
idea. Experiences are unique.
Part V: Specialty Shopping 
192
Gifting for out-of-town friends
Next to many items at eBay you may see a small gift box icon. The gift box icon
means that the seller may gift wrap the item and ship it as a gift to another person
and address. As you have learned, the seller isn’t protected when they ship to an
address other than your registered address, so sellers consider this a special con-
cession to a buyer.
If you find an item that interests you as a gift, and the seller isn’t showing the gift
icon, don’t be afraid to ask the seller (before you bid) if he or she would perform this
service for you. Many a seller will respond positively to a nicely written note.

In This Chapter
 Discovering eBay’s own outlet mall
 Getting the skinny on refurbished goods
 Defining liquidations
O
ne of the reasons I originally gravitated toward eBay is that I
dearly love getting a bargain. Getting merchandise of quality
and saving money at the same time is right up there on my top ten
list of favorite things to do.
I used to have the time to spend a day at an outlet mall and shop.
But as life got busier, I would only go to outlet malls at sale time to
get merchandise to sell at eBay. Now, alas, I don’t even have time
for that — but luckily, eBay has plenty of sellers who work just like
the outlets you love in the bricks-and-mortar world. The trick is
knowing how to find them!
Wandering Around eBay’s
Outlet Mall
I like to think of eBay’s stores as a quick and easy outlet mall.
Although I give you the straight scoop at eBay stores in Chapter 16,
I’d like to give you a little close up of the types of retailers who have
their outlets here at eBay. Search eBay’s store names and descrip-
tions from the main eBay Store page (see Figure 17-1) and you’ll
discover your favorite brands and stores. 

To get to the search box shown in Figure 17-1, you have a choice.
Go to www.ebaystores.com or click the eBay Stores in the
Specialty sites area link on the eBay home page. When you get the
eBay stores home page, the search box is in the upper-right corner,
below the Navigation Bar.
Figure 17-1: Searching for brand- 
name outlets in eBay stores.
Major retailers who’ve set up shop here include Sears, Kodak,
Samsonite, Sharper Image, Motorola, Ritz Camera, Dell, Amtrak (for
selected routes), and more.
Do a search of eBay stores using words like outlet and liquidation,
and you’ll find some excellent buys.
Getting the Skinny on
Refurbished Goods
You can find great deals on refurbished electronic merchandise at
eBay. Unfortunately, refurbished merchandise gets an unnecessar-
ily bad rap. Very smart people may tell you to be wary of refur-
bished merchandise. Great advice . . . I guess. I tell people to be
wary of all merchandise.
The way I figure it, refurbished merchandised has been gone over
by the manufacturer twice — new merchandise has only been gone
over once! I buy refurbished merchandise all the time.
Let me explain what refurbished merchandise is, and why it can be
such a bargain. Refurbished merchandise can fall into one of these
categories:
Part V: Specialty Shopping 
194

 Canceled orders: This is merchandise that’s in perfectly good
shape. When a customer makes a special order and then
changes his or her mind, or the order is somehow mucked up
(“I ordered a PC. You sent me a Mac!”), something has to be
done with the merchandise. Enter you, the savvy shopper.
 Evaluation units: An evaluation unit is a piece of equipment
that is sent to a member of the media or to a corporation for
testing or review purposes. Evaluation units must be returned
to the manufacturer, and the manufacturer may decide to
unload it for a couple of extra bucks.
 Store returns: This is probably pretty obvious to you, right?
Joe Customer buys something in a store, takes it home, and
opens it, only to decide that he doesn’t really want it so much.
By law, as soon as the box is opened, a piece of merchandise
can never be sold as new again, even if the merchandise was
never used.
 Defective units: A piece of merchandise that is deemed defec-
tive, either by the store or by the user, is returned to the 
manufacturer.
 Overstocks: When a manufacturer comes out with a new
model, it may take back the older models from retailers in an
effort to encourage them to stock more of the newer, faster,
cooler model.
Whenever an item is returned to the manufacturer for any reason
and the original box has been opened, the item (whether it is a tel-
evision, a computer, a camera, or some other technical device),
must be reconditioned to the manufacturer’s original quality stan-
dards. Any parts that are non-functioning are replaced with func-
tioning components, and the item is repackaged. The manufacturer
usually gives refurbished items a 90-day warranty.
You can purchase an extended warranty that completely covers
(yep, 100 percent) parts and labor on refurbished electronics you
buy at eBay (with no deductibles). To find out more about eBay
Warranty Services, check out Chapter 14. After your purchase, go
to http://smart.newcorp.com/ebay/jsp/EBAY-NewStep1.jsp.
You can also check out http://pages.ebay.com/help/warranty/
buyer_overview.html.
Even after purchasing an extended warranty, the savings on refur-
bished name-brand merchandise can be substantial.
Chapter 17: Shopping eBay’s Bargain Basement 195

When buying refurbished goods, be sure the original manufacturer
was the one doing the reconditioning. I’m sure that some technical
geek can fix things just fine in his or her garage, but you don’t have
the same level of protection (as in, you don’t have a warranty from
a reliable source at all) if you buy a piece of equipment that wasn’t
fixed by the manufacturer.
Defining Liquidations
Liquidations could be about my favorite kind of bargain hunting.
Merchandise can be new, used, or trashed. Searching through liq-
uidators’ auctions is like digging through the “Final Sale” bin at a
store, where prices are marked down to absurd levels. 
Liquidators buy merchandise from companies that are in financial
distress and need to raise cash quickly. The kinds of issues compa-
nies face can vary — the why isn’t important. All you need to know
is that you can get access to some astonishing deals because some
of it is sold piece by piece to the public at eBay.
Liquidators buy by the truckload (I’m talking 18-wheeler, not
pickup). From there the merchandise is unloaded, inspected, and
sorted — and then the fun begins. Some of the merchandise can be
put together in wholesale lots (the goods are grouped together by
the pallet or by the case and sold to wholesalers or retailers), and
some of the merchandise may be put aside to be sold one by one
to individual buyers at eBay.
Buying items from liquidators can be a risky enterprise. There’s no
warranty, and no one you can complain to if something is wrong
with the item. All items are always sold as is and where is.
Essentially, what you see is what you get, if it works, it’s a bonus.
Here are some tips for buying this type of item:
 Look for a sealed box: Look at the picture and read the
description carefully. If it is stated that the item is sealed in
the manufacturer’s packaging, you’ve got a pretty good
chance that the item is in new condition.
 Don’t spend a bundle: This kind of goes without saying,
right? It’s supposed to be a bargain. Don’t go crazy.
Part V: Specialty Shopping 
196

One of my favorite liquidators at eBay sells under two names,
Bargainland-Media for DVDs and videos and Bargainland-
Liquidation for literally everything else. This liquidator operates
out of a 100,000-square-foot facility in Phoenix, and it has hundreds
of loyal customers at eBay.
Bargainland does take hits with negative feedback as well. People
are often unhappy when their dice shoot turns up snake eyes. I’ve
bought from this liquidator as well, and have carefully steered
clear of anything that wasn’t a fairly safe bet. I also follow my own
advice and rarely buy an item from Bargainland that isn’t new in
the manufacturer’s box — or cheap enough to gamble with. 
Table 17-1 shows a very short list of a few typical liquidation auc-
tions and their final bids.

Looks like fun doesn’t it? But remember, there’s always a risk. On
Bargainland-Liquidation’s About Me page, the company’s policy is
clearly stated. A portion of which is below:
We are not able to compensate customers for any discrepancies in
product. We will, however, assure customers that they will get the
EXACT merchandise that they see in the photo regardless of the
description. Please keep in mind that liquidation is not for everyone.
Bargainland does not offer any refunds, warranties or returns of any
kind for any reason. The only reason you will ever be given a refund
by our company is if you did not receive the product shown in the
photograph. Please consider this carefully before you buy.
Buyer beware — but have lots of fun!

I
f there’s one purchase that I don’t enjoy making it’s buying a car.
Please don’t misunderstand. I love cars, and I have a personal
attachment to every car I’ve ever owned. It’s just that each time
I’m approached by a car salesman, I get intimidated. The minute
the salesman says, “I’ve got to check with my sales manager to see
if I can do that,” I just know I’m a goner.
And when I’ve finally decided on the car model I want, I still have
to face the deal, when Mr. Sales Guy calls in the finance manager
to try to sell me warranties, alarms, ups, and extras that I never
wanted or needed. I guess I’m not a good car buyer. I feel the need
to run out of the dealership — and I usually do.
If this feeling is familiar to you, I would like to introduce my fellow
car buyers to the sweetest deal of the 21st century, eBay Motors.
In 2003, eBay projects sales of over $2 billion in the eBay Motors
venue alone. I’d say that makes eBay the largest auto mall in the
universe. 
On the down-to-earth side, Jupiter Media Metrix, the premier
analyst of the Internet, recently ranked eBay Motors (shown in
Figure 18-1) the number one automotive site on the Web. 

Figure 18-1: The eBay Motors home page.
Introducing Motors
For some of us, eBay Motors is a magnificent fantasy site. I have a
friend who browses the Volkswagen Bus category; his eyes glaze
over with hope and awe as he reads each listing. I’m sure he’s reliv-
ing his hippy days of the late ’60s. Another friend reads the Ferrari
and Lamborghini listings, he knows every color combination and
variation; he pooh-poohs all the aftermarket changes to the clas-
sics. My best friend checks out the vintage Thunderbirds and pic-
tures herself as Suzanne Sommers flirting with the guys in
American Graffiti. Then of course there’s my fantasy car; the butter-
cup yellow Rolls Royce Corniche driven by Teensy in The Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. (I’ve yet to find one at eBay in that
color combination — but then again, I couldn’t afford one if I did
find it!)
I’ve known several people who have successfully purchased cars
at eBay Motors. They couldn’t have found deals like these at their
home dealerships and are very, very happy with their purchases.
Many of the cars at eBay Motors are private party sales, bank
cars (repossessions), and cars that have been cherry-picked by
wholesalers and dealer overstocks. There are also the professional
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
202

car dealers selling their rare, hard-to-find cars to a marketplace
that draws between 4 to 5 million visitors per month. You can’t get
that many people through the door at a local dealership! Dealers
put up the rare colors and limited-edition vehicles because this is
an auction site, and the rarer an item the more likely bidders are to
get excited. The more excited bidders are, the more they lose their
heads — and the higher the price goes.
Yes, this is an auction, and the bidding goes hot and heavy, an
average of seven to eight bids per auction. It’s a very competitive
environment for the most desirable cars. Dealers can sell cars for
less at eBay, because it costs them less to sell. (They don’t have to
pay the finance manager to twist your arm to buy the ups and
extras.) Cars sell quickly at eBay, and they’re making money on
volume, not by picking your pockets.
Enter the eBay Motors site in two ways, go to www.ebaymotors.
com or click the eBay Motors link in the top-left corner of the eBay
home page.
Finding More Than Cars
The truly amazing part about eBay Motors is that it has more than
just the usual cars and vans. In fact, the rule seems to be that if it
has an engine, you’ll find it right here. You can find just about any-
thing to get you from one place to another. Here’s a description of
the Other Vehicles categories:
 ATVs: Within the ATV category you’ll find a wide selection of new
and used 4-x-4s and 2-x-4s; You can find 3 wheelers and 4 wheel-
ers. I even found a few six-wheel amphibious vehicle! Bidding in
this category is very active, and the items move quickly.
 Aircraft: Anything that flies can be found here: hot air bal-
loons to military trainer jets. Browsing this category is amaz-
ing, who could imagine that with a click of your mouse (and
enough money), you could own your own Bell helicopter or
Gulfstream jet. If you’ve ever even dreamt of taking up flying,
this just might be the category to get your hobby started!
 Boats & Watercraft: This category was so full that I got sea-
sick just browsing! It has its own subcategories of Fishing
Boats, Personal Watercraft (Sea-Doo, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and
so on.), Powerboats, Sailboats, and others (kayaks, canoes,
pontoons, tenders and dinghies). I know boats, and I saw
Chapter 18: Driving a Deal at eBay Motors 203

some incredible deals in this category. There were some beau-
tiful Bass boats and Boston Whalers at incredible prices.
There were also a dozen or so Bayliners that caught my eye,
especially the 47-foot Pilot House Motoryacht with a starting
bid of $290,000 (sigh). It was also nice to see a wide selection
(pricewise) for sailboats. With some time spent shopping in
the category, you can find just about anything you want;
within your price range.
 Buses, Motorcoaches: No kidding. You want to start your own
bus line? Here’s the place to find the busses — and it seems
that plenty of people are interested in them! There’s active
bidding on old school busses and coaches in this category
(and I thought the American family was getting smaller).
 Commercial Trucks: Since commercial trucks are something I
know jack about, I went to some experts who browsed the site
and examined the deals. Here’s their review for those in the
know. The items are good quality, and the type they’d like to
find at good commercial truck auctions. The prices are good
bargains, and they say they will be visiting the site regularly
from now on — sounds like a good recommendation to me!
 Scooters & Minibikes: Aside from what you’d expect to find
here, this is the home for beautiful vintage and new Vespa
motor scooters.
 Snowmobiles: Since I’ve never really lived in a snow part of
the country, I can only imagine how much fun these bad boys
are! The bidding for snowmobiles is very active, right now
averaging 15 bids each! Again, you’ll see everything from top-
of-the-line new ones to gently used, private party sales.
 Miscellaneous: Now this is some great stuff! How about a 1947
Coca-Cola vending truck — complete with fountain, cotton
candy machine and propane-powered hot dog cooker! Sounds
like a carnival on wheels! Well, okay, it doesn’t run, buy hey —
it’s only $3,000! There’s also a Shelby Cobra kit, no motor or
tranny — but you need a hobby, don’t you? I also found a
Think Neighbor electric vehicle; a sandrail dunebuggy four-
seater; go-carts and car haulers. There’s nothing you can’t
find at eBay!
Getting the Deals
Depends what you call a deal. If you consider it a deal to even have
the opportunity to buy the 2003 Ford Thunderbird Limited Edition
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
204

(only 700 made), James Bond 007 Roadster for $45,995 — hey —
this is the place to find the deals! If that’s not enough room, there’s
also a 1999 Bentley Continental SC (only 1 of 14) with a Targa top;
Buy It Now for only $220,000!
Collectors can find the best of the best at eBay. You’re not limited
to the lag time of a published magazine or by what’s available
when you’re at a dealership. You’ve got the world at your finger-
tips (or at your mouse-clicks). Now, for the rest of us. Sigh. When I
was growing up, I heard the words “reliable transportation” quite a
bit when it came to buying a car. When I was in college, reliable
transportation was important, but it faded just a bit; the “cool
factor” slid into first place on my list of what was important when
buying a car.
eBay Motors offers thousands of good reliable cars every day on
the site — some of them are loaded with cool.
Finding your dream car
eBay Motors is laid out in a very matter-of-fact, organized manner.
From the home page, click Cars, to see another page of subcate-
gories that lists about every car manufacturer you have ever heard
of, and even one or two you probably haven’t thought of in a while
(like DeLorean and Avanti). 
If you don’t have a particular car in mind; you might at least have a
manufacturer you’re interested in. You can just click the name and
browse the category.
Chapter 18: Driving a Deal at eBay Motors 205
How much cash should you spend?
Of course budget is a personal thing. But there are a couple of sites on the Internet
that can give you a very good idea of what you should expect to spend on a new or
used vehicle.
The venerable Kelley Blue Book has a site, www.kbb.com, which will give you
basic vehicle pricing information. 
Another site, NADA Appraisal Guides, gives more in-depth pricing on new and
used cars. NADA Guides also gives pricing on classic cars; used motorcycles,
boats, recreational vehicles, aircraft and mobile homes. You’ll find it at www.nada
guides.com.

If you have an idea of what kind of car you want, I highly recom-
mend the eBay Motors Search. It’s a search engine just for eBay
Motors. Click Search on the top of the eBay Motors page, just
below the logo. Then click the tab, Passenger Vehicles, as shown in
Figure 18-2.
Using the drop-down menus, click the arrow to select your automo-
bile manufacturer name. This will change the options in the Vehicle
Models drop-down menu. Click the arrow to select the model that
you are interested in. If you have a preference as to vehicle year, fill
in the four-digit year span that you will accept in your search. I
suggest that you leave the rest blank so that you get the best idea
of what is on the market for your car. Click the Search button, and
you’ll see all the vehicles up for sale at the time.
Studying the listings
Each listing reflects the personality and the style of the seller.
That’s one of the fun things about eBay. When you’re through read-
ing a listing, you know about the item and about the seller (at least
if you’re lucky). A brusquely written description may mean you’re
doing business with someone who won’t follow through with the
important details.

206

The listing in Figure 18-3 is from the seller, e-vehicles. Note that all
eBay Motors listings have an area below the standard feature
photo that gives you the Cliffs Notes version on facts of the car. 
If the car isn’t what you’re looking for, click the Back button on
your browser and look at the next car. eBay has very craftily put
the meat of the car details near the top of the listing page, so it
won’t take forever to work your way through the many car listings.
If the snapshot information passes muster, scroll down to read
more. Below the snapshot you’ll find the seller’s description, and
some detailed and clear photographs. Here are the well-written
details of e-vehicles’ description for a Camaro for sale:
2000 Chevrolet Camaro Coupe
Gold Check Certified one-owner local trade
This Gold Check Certified one-owner local trade was purchased
and maintained at our area’s largest Chevrolet dealership until it
was traded in last week. This Medium Red Camaro is equipped
with the 200-hp 3.8-liter ohv V6 with automatic overdrive trans-
mission. It also has tilt wheel, AM/FM cassette premium sound,
AC, premium wheel covers, ABS, dual airbags, intermittent
wipers, rear spoiler, power steering, and dual remote mirrors.
There is a full compliment of factory books and a few records in
the glove box.

Gold Check Certified Pre-Owned Vehicles undergo a 70 item qual-
ity-assurance inspection by trained technicians. Gold Check
Certified Vehicles are reconditioned in preparation for resale to
ensure your satisfaction. It’s the next best thing to owning a new
vehicle. In addition, I purchased a brand new set of Bridgestone
Potenza radials at the time of service. All service is current on
this beautiful Camaro.
The car has surprising power and really runs and drives great.
The motor, transmission, brakes, and components perform like
new. This car has been gently driven and retains that snappy,
new-car feel.
The exterior and interior are in fine condition as well. Expect
only a few very minor dings and scratches on this awesome
Chevy. The interior looks great, but is missing the mat set. The
carpets, seats and trim are in excellent condition. This car was
previously owned by a non-smoker from McDavid, Florida.
This Chevrolet Camaro has a clean, one-owner background his-
tory with no accidents, damage, or discrepancies. The winning
bidder will be given a clean title at the time of delivery. The
mileage is actual and confirmed.
This seller also runs 12 beautiful photos of the car. He publishes
the results of the Carfax title report, reporting a clean title history,
and his business philosophy:
My Business Philosophy
My dealership is entirely focused on the sales of vehicles via the
eBay format. I make all purchasing and sales decisions and am
100 percent responsible for the content of my auctions. I person-
ally answer every email and conduct all business regarding the
sale of this vehicle.
I am a SquareTrade member, which means I have been recog-
nized for my outstanding efforts at attaining customer satisfac-
tion. In addition, eBay recognizes me as a Platinum Level Power
Seller.
I buy and list approximately 15-20 units per month.
I look at hundreds of vehicles each week that do not make the
cut. . .
This is my living.
I do this full time. I do not have a “car lot.” eBay has been my
dealership for years, and all operations are focused towards
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
208

bringing you the best vehicle possible at the best price you will
find. I am committed to this format and take your vehicle pur-
chase very seriously. You are dealing with a secure seller.
The seller then goes on to give the terms of sale, more information
on the transaction and an e-mail address and phone number for
questions. As a buyer, I feel comfortable with this sort of thorough
information.
Seller’s terms
Be sure that the seller’s terms match your own agenda. If you can’t
pick up the car within the next two weeks, and the seller needs it
off his or her property in seven days and won’t budge — don’t
make the purchase. (Unless you can arrange shipping — or have
someone pick up the car for you — see “Using Motorists Aid for
Purchases,” later in this chapter.)
Also, if you want to pay via PayPal, be sure the seller accepts that
form of payment. As always, be sure you read the terms and can
comply.
I know that my constant harangue about feedback ratings can get
mind numbing, but the bigger the purchase the more important
the seller’s reputation becomes. How many times can you pur-
chase a car, and get comments from the last 30 or so people
they’ve done business with? (Be sure, when you’re examining the
seller’s feedback, to click on the auction number link to be sure the
seller didn’t get all the positive feedback for selling He-Man VHS
tapes.)
On a purchase as important as this, ask lots of question before you
place your bid. If the seller posts a phone number, be sure to call.
See how you feel about doing business with this person. Once you
place your bid, if you win, it’s a binding contract to buy.
Knowing the additional costs
Don’t forget that there will be additional costs when you buy your
new car. Your insurance company will be one of the first to jump in
with additional fees, and of course there are license fees.
Chapter 18: Driving a Deal at eBay Motors 209

DMV fees
There is a super page online with links to Web sites for the
Department of Motor Vehicles for all 50 states (and Washington,
D.C.). From your state’s home page, you can find out all the required
fees, how to get the licenses, and whether personalized plates are
available. You’ll find the links at http://dmvwebsites.com/.
If you are a member of a local chapter of AAA, check out its Web
site before going to the DMV. The Auto Club here in southern
California has a direct computer line to the DMV. I went online and
got all my information from the DMV and brought it into the auto
club; the good people there processed everything I needed, and I
never had to stand in the dreaded DMV lines. Check out http://
www.aaa.com/scripts/WebObjects.dll/ZipCode.
Finding financing
If you have to get your vehicle financed, eBay has a relationship
with eLoan that can approve you if you live in the state of
California. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/ebaymotors/
services/eLoan-financing.html.
For everyone else in the country, I found PeopleFirst.com online,
an online finance company that finances person-to-person transac-
tions for used car loans. I’ve used PeopleFirst myself and found its
service quick and uncomplicated. You can find out more about
obtaining a loan from PeopleFirst at www.peoplefirst.com.

Need a one-way ticket?
We all know that airlines charge bundles for one-way airfares, and it seems such
a waste to buy a round-trip ticket and fly one way. I’ve got a deal for you! Search
eBay for Southwest Airlines one way. Frequent flyers who get free flight awards
from Southwest don’t always use them, and the awards are transferable, but it’s
not legal to sell them. Crafty eBay sellers sell the drink coupons that come with the
free flight coupons and give the air ticket for free! You can get a one-way ticket to
anywhere in the country for around $140 — and get a free drink to boot! See

alliance with Dependable Auto Shippers. Dependable is, um,
dependable, and has decades of experience in auto shipping.
Shipping your vehicle can add hundreds of dollars to the cost of
your purchase. Isn’t it more fun to take a day or two off work and
pick up your car? If you must have your car shipped, here’s a link
to its online quote form https://www.dasautoshippers.com/
ebay/irate.asp.
Using your My eBay Watch tab
On a purchase such as this, unless you’ve found the perfect car
right off the bat, you might want to “watch” the bidding on some
similar cars. Study when the high bids come in. See what’s hot on
the eBay market, and what’s not. You might just find that your My
eBay page can give you the edge, when it comes to buying.
In Chapter 4, I gave you the tour of the My eBay page. On your
Bidding/Watching page, you have an area of Items I’m Watching.
Figure 18-4 is a section from my Items I’m Watching, featuring some
cars that I want to keep an eye on.
Make a note of something very special here. Sellers at eBay Motors
have the privilege of lowering their reserves, or Buy It Now prices
during the auction. This is great for buyers, especially if you’re
keeping an eye on the bidding. A seller may decide to lower the
price, and you can jump right in and catch the deal before anyone
else notices!

Chapter 18: Driving a Deal at eBay Motors 211

Picking Up Parts
When I travel around the country teaching at eBay University, I
often learn about different ways to make a living by using the eBay
venue. The legal chop shop is a recurring theme. Entrepreneurial
young (some not so young) men and women around the country
attend auto auctions and pick up cars that have been in the worst
of car wrecks. These cars are only good for one thing — parts.
So the entrepreneurial shade-tree mechanics bring the cars home,
expertly take them apart, screw by screw, and catalog and bag
each and every part. Whether you’re a collector, home hobbyist, or
mechanic, you can take advantage of the low, low prices at eBay,
when you’re restoring or repairing a car.
When I wanted to bring my 1985 Corvette back to her former glory,
I was appalled at the prices I was quoted for parts and labor. I
made a list of everything I needed, and approached eBay with cau-
tion. Little by little, piece by piece, I purchased almost all the parts
I needed from eBay sellers: the interior halo, all the exterior
emblems, weather stripping and interior carpeting. I ended up
paying about one-third of what it would have cost me locally. I
loaded up the car with all the parts (okay, it took several runs) to
my trusted mechanic, and he installed all the parts for a low hourly
rate. Thanks to the money I saved buying at eBay, I was able to get
a beautiful paint job!
When searching for parts at eBay Motors use this search trick,
based on the lessons in Chapter 10 to make sure you get the right
year for the make and model you’re looking for. If you’re looking for
parts for a 1985 Corvette, for example, type (85,1985) Corvette in
the Search box.
Some sellers use the entire year in their title, and others will not.
Using Motorists Aid for Purchases
eBay has gone the distance when it comes to assuring a smooth
transaction at eBay Motors. The venue has added features and pro-
tection to assure that prudent shoppers have safe transactions. I
say prudent because if you are reckless and bid without caution,
no one can save you from your own foolishness.
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
212

Welcome to the eBay 
Assurance program
The eBay Assurance program is made up of several parts:
 Limited warranty: A limited warranty is provided to eBay
Motors buyers for free on eligible used cars under 10 years
old with fewer than 125,000 miles. This limited warranty
covers the car for the first month or 1,000 miles (whichever
comes first). The warranty covers up to $10,000 in damages,
and there is a $500 deductible per visit. For more details and
to see which cars are eligible, go to http://pages.ebay.
com/ebaymotors/services/warranty.html.
 Purchase insurance: Purchase insurance protects against
material fraud or misrepresentation. That’s legalese for the
big problems, like the odometer being different from the
description in the auction, or undisclosed mechanical defects,
or perhaps there isn’t a clear title to the car; you know —
major headaches! The maximum coverage provided is $20,000
with a $500 deductible. The fine print can be found at http://
pages.ebay.com/ebaymotors/services/insurance.html.
 Vehicle inspection services: This would be number one on
my list when buying a car from a seller who is miles away
from my home. You can schedule a bumper-to-bumper inspec-
tion of the car at the seller’s location for under $100. Certainly,
this could be the best money you’ll spend if you can’t send
your own mechanic to take a look at the car. Pricing and an
application are located at http://pages.ebay.com/ebay
motors/services/inspection/inspection.html.
 Secure Pay by Escrow.com: A traditional escrow service,
where you submit payment to the escrow company, who in
turn then tells the seller to ship the vehicle. Once the vehicle
arrives at your location and you are satisfied that it is what
you purchased, you accept the vehicle, and the escrow com-
pany releases the money to the seller. If you want to partici-
pate in an escrow, the seller must agree to this type of
transaction in advance before you place your bid. The minu-
tiae are at http://pages.ebay.com/ebaymotors/services/
securepay.html.
Chapter 18: Driving a Deal at eBay Motors 213

Protecting yourself
There are a few things you can do to protect yourself before pur-
chasing a vehicle. If the seller hasn’t run a Lemon Check on the car,
you should. By the way, Lemon Check has become somewhat of a
misnomer. The traditional Lemon Check used to merely check to
see if the car was identified as a “Lemon” under a stated Lemon
Law. Now, a service, CarFax, runs a complete car history check,
which has become known as a Lemon Check.
Get the car’s VIN number from the top of the eBay auction. Just so
you know, the vehicle identification number appears on every car.
It’s a metal strip, visible on the driver’s side through the wind-
shield. Each car has a different number, identifying the characteris-
tics of the vehicle, including manufacturer, year, model, body,
engine specifications and serial number. It is assigned at the fac-
tory when the car is made.
It is worth the $14.99 to know whether the car has been in any
major accidents, or the odometer reading is correct, if it has been
salvaged and more. This report will give you the complete car his-
tory. If the seller doesn’t provide one, go to http://pages.ebay.
com/ebaymotors/services/carfax_lemoncheck.html.

 Vacationing in your own resort timeshare
 Getting commercial property
 Finding bargain foreclosures, homes, and condos
 Completing the transaction
S
ince the founding of our country, land has been valued as a
great commodity; passed from generation to generation. As
Gerald O’Hara so eloquently put it, “it’s the only thing that lasts.”
(Remember that scene from Gone with the Wind?) American farm-
land sprawls across the country, and there’s plenty of open space.
But because of urbanization and many other factors, large areas of
land have had to be subdivided and sold.
People buy land for investment, vacations, or retirement. It’s no
longer common for a family to spend their entire life in one home.
We move and often live in many different places. Real estate,
although a major purchase, is becoming more and more an every-
day transaction.
The smart people at eBay are sly trend-spotters, so they opened
an official category for real estate transactions in fall 2000. You can
access eBay’s Real Estate category through the category link on
the left side of the home page or by going directly to http://www.
ebayrealestate.com (see Figure 19-1).

Figure 19-1: Your home for real estate deals.
Because substantial legal restrictions are involved in real estate
transactions, sellers can choose to list their properties as an auc-
tion or list the property at eBay in the form of an advertisement.
When you participate in a listing that is listed in ad format, you do
not place bids. At the bottom of the item’s description page, there
is a form for you to fill out that sends your information to the
seller. Once the seller receives this information, he or she can con-
tact you, and the two of you may negotiate privately. Take a look at
Figure 19-2, and you’ll see that if we browse the “Residential Homes
for sale” category; a small ad icon in the Bids column indicates
items that are listed as advertisements.
Most residential home sales are handled in this manner. Land and
timeshares are typically sold in the auction format.
Because of a wide variety of laws governing the intricacies and
legalities in real estate transactions, the auction may be non-
binding. Before getting involved in any real estate transactions at
eBay, I suggest you read the official rules; they can be found at
http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/re_agreement.html.
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
216

Figure 19-2: Residential homes can be listed in either the 
Auction or the Ad format.
Getting Your Piece of America
To own a piece of land outright is a great feeling. Whether you plan
to live on it or not, just standing on it and knowing that you own it
is a great feeling. More and more eBay buyers are getting that feel-
ing. Plenty of virgin land is showing up at eBay in lots and acres on
a daily basis.
When shopping for land, as in any real estate transaction, do your
research and due diligence. Because most land transactions at
eBay are auctions (rather than an ad that is closed by a real estate
professional), be sure to read the auction description. Here are
some questions you should ask before placing a bid:
 Are you bidding on a down payment or is it a straight sale?
A straight sale is one in which the final bid amount is the total
price of the property. If you’re bidding a down payment, find
out whether the seller will finance the sale, and how much the
payments are, what the interest rate will be, and what the
other financing terms are.
Chapter 19: Joining the eBay Land Rush 217

 Is the property buildable? Is the land level, forested, or
rocky? Is there a zoning regulation requiring you to build on
the property within so many years? Will it allow motor homes
(if you’re choosing it as a camping location)?
 Are there utilities on or nearby the property? Find out if
there’s a well. If you need to drill, what is the well depth? Is
there a septic tank? Are there paved roads?
 How much are the taxes? Are there any association fees? Are
the taxes (and any fees) current?
 Is the title guaranteed clear? What is the legal description
(lot number, tract, block)?
 How far away is it from civilization? (Hello? Hello? Hello?)
When you’ve found a piece of land that you like, do even more
research (no matter how nice the seller seems). Say you find some
acreage in Billings, Montana. Go to an Internet search engine and
type a search for Billings Montana Assessor.
When I did this search, the second link that came up in my search
gave me the information I was looking for: the Billings, Montana,
tax assessor’s office. One click and I had the phone number of the
assessor’s office to check that all property taxes were current. You
might also be able to ask the clerk if there is a site that will show
you the exact location of the land on a map.
If you want the real lowdown on the area, type the following URL in
your browser. Make sure that the last five numbers of this link are
the zip code of the area you are interested in, rather than my exam-
ple of 10022:
http://houseandhome.msn.com/pickaplace/nf_details.asp
x?search=1&zip=10022
The page that pops up offers demographic information on the
area you’re interested in. You also see some links on the page to
Neighborhood Types, which reveal interesting demographics
about the people in the area — even down to the magazines they
read!
I confess to having bought land at eBay. Most of it was bought
during book research (that’s my story, and I’m sticking to it). A
look at my diverse real estate holdings gives you a sense of the
variety of bargains you can find at eBay:
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
218

 A postage stamp–size lot in Bakersfield, California (a 26-x-26
foot plot of land, to be exact — but hey, it’s mine)
 Five acres about 500 feet from the Colorado River in southern
Colorado
 A 50 foot-x-142 foot lot in Beryl, Utah (because my husband’s
name is Beryl)
 A timeshare in Miami Beach (we already owned another week
at the same resort and loved it)
Building a Getaway Home
When you’ve bought your own little acre, (maybe it’s just big
enough for a mobile home — but you don’t have one of those
either) wouldn’t you like to be able to visit it — maybe even spend
time on it (without having to pitch a tent)?
But you aren’t rich enough to be spending money on a second
home? Build it yourself! If you’re the ambitious type (hey, don’t
look at me), I’ve found a very successful seller at eBay who sells
some beautiful log cabin homes. No, not like the one ol’ Abe
Lincoln was born in, but truly beautiful kit homes that are very liv-
able. Log_Cabin_Home sells you just about everything you need,
and I’ve seen his prices starting as low as $5,600 (see Figure 19-3).
Figure 19-3: Build your dream home for less money.
Chapter 19: Joining the eBay Land Rush 219

You have to install the plumbing, electrical and anything else that
is required to abide by your local building codes, but the starter kit
is the perfect solution for your getaway home on the piece of land
you’ve just bought at eBay!
Finding Commercial Property
Have you ever thought of just chucking it all, selling everything
and starting somewhere else new? If you’ve never thought of it,
just looking over eBay’s commercial property (Figure 19-4) might
tempt you to do just that.
On the other hand, if you’re looking for a great opportunity — a
place to start out, this is the place to view your options. Just today,
I’ve found
 A coffee shop in Homer, Alaska (the Halibut fishing capital of
the world)
 An RV park in Colorado
 A very lucrative gas station in Kansas (owner has no other
choice but to sell)
Figure 19-4: Some of the amazing commercial property 
for sale at eBay.

220

 A boat yard and marina in upstate New York (owner retiring
after 26 years)
 A profitable turnkey USDA sausage manufacturing plant
(owner retiring and will train)
 Much, much more
If you have the time, be sure to browse this category; it’s a lot of
fun, and you just might find your dream business — and new life.
Of course, there’s even more due diligence involved when you’re
buying a business than when you’re bidding on a plot of land. An
accountant and a lawyer should be involved in transactions such
as these. Most of the transactions in this category are listed in the
ad format; you send your information to the seller and negotiate
offline. If the business is an auction, be sure to contact the seller to
get all questions asked before bidding.
Buying Residential Property
Residential real estate is divided into several categories. You can
buy homes and condos for sale by private parties, and get a bar-
gain in the process by saving the large percentage that is tradition-
ally charged by full-service brokers. 
I spoke to my local broker, and he unquestionably agreed about
the savings. Real estate brokers spend lots of time marketing prop-
erties that may never sell because sellers may have unrealistic
expectations of how much they can get for their properties.
Putting a property up for sale at eBay gives sellers a good idea of
how much work is involved in selling their property. eBay’s a win-
win venue for both the buyer and the seller. A professional broker
does need to step in, of course, when it comes to closing the deal.
Disclosure statements, title searches and those sticky legalities are
best left to professionals, but these services will come at a much
lower price — once the deal has been struck at eBay.
Finding new and custom homes
Who’d have thought that new home developers would have turned
to eBay to sell their homes? They always have those fancy furnished
Chapter 19: Joining the eBay Land Rush 221

models, well-dressed sales people and fine brochures. Who would
even believe they’d think that little old eBay could help them sell
their homes. Ha! Those guys and gals at eBay have always been
smart like foxes, and they also know a good thing when they see it.
How else can they expose their homes to 49 million people for a
few hundred dollars in listing fees?
In this subcategory of real estate, you’ll find listings by developers
whose homes are in the planning, building and selling stages. You’ll
be able to look at the plans and contact the builders. Browsing this
category is just like viewing model homes.
Finding Foreclosures
Finding foreclosures at eBay isn’t difficult, but it is certainly not a mis-
sion for the amateur. You will find several types of foreclosures. Some
are sold by the lender (an individual or a bank) and some are being
sold by HUD (no, not Paul Newman), the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development; or the VA (Veterans Administration). To
make an offer on a foreclosed property, you must have a licensed
real estate agent make the offer for you. If you currently don’t work
with a broker, eBay has a page that will help you find a broker
experienced in these types of transactions. You will find it at
www.ebayrealestate.net/find_agent_f.htm.
HUD and VA homes, contrary to urban legend, cannot be pur-
chased for a dollar. They can be quite a bargain, and generally are
sold at market value, but in an “as-is” state, without warranty. The
agencies realize that repairs may have to be made to these proper-
ties, and the asking price reflects this fact.
In many states, HUD or the VA may pay all, or a portion of, closing
or financing costs as well as sales commission. It is up to the agent
to negotiate this for the buyer.
These homes should be professionally inspected so that all needed
repairs will be known prior to making an offer on the property. 
Foreclosed homes are sold in an offer period. At the end of the
period, all bids are opened, and the property is sold to the highest
reasonable bid. If the home isn’t sold within the initial period, bids
may be submitted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and will be opened
the next business day. When HUD or the VA finally accepts a bid,
the submitting broker is notified within approximately 48 hours.
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
222

If you’re hooked on the idea of foreclosures and you’d like to get
the listings the minute eBay receives them, you can sign up for
e-mail notification by going to www.ebayrealestate.net/
prop_email_f.htm.
Bidding on Vacation Timeshares
Ok, here’s where you can sign me up. I like the idea of knowing that
I’m forced to go to a beautiful condo on the beach for the same
week every year. No matter what. It’s my week, my week in the sun.
Owning my timeshare guarantees that I get at least one weekend
away each year. True, I often have to take my laptop and complete
a few chapters, but heck, I do them from a lounge chair (with piña
colada in hand) on the beach in Miami! I know, I know. It’s no fun
living the life of a starving writer (see Figure 19-5).
Some people like to buy timeshares for their trading power. There
are organizations like RCI (Resort Condominiums International)
that will take your week at your timeshare in trade for a different
week at another timeshare at any of its inventory of close to 4,000
resorts worldwide! Some of my friends have never even visited
their home timeshare; they just keep trading!
Figure 19-5: This piece of the tropics sold for around
$2,800 at eBay.
Chapter 19: Joining the eBay Land Rush 223

I think we’ve all heard of someone who has attended a high-pressure
timeshare presentation for a new timeshare. They not only had
high pressure but high prices. Sadly, the person who first buys a
new timeshare pays the highest price — he or she is covering the
resort developer’s marketing and advertising costs. Once the unit
goes up for resale at eBay, the bargain is yours. Here are a few
things to check on when you consider buying a timeshare at eBay:
 Find out if the timeshare is fixed week or floating: The year
is broken up into 52 numbered weeks, and the weeks usually
start on a Saturday. In a fixed-week arrangement, you pur-
chase a particular week, and that week’s reserved for you
each year. To find out when, say, week 22 lands in the more-
typical monthly calendar, go to a search engine such as
Yahoo! or Google and search for timeshare calendar.
A floating week usually starts on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday
and goes on a first come, first served basis. The week you
spend in the timeshare may vary from year to year; what your
purchase price is based on is size and quality of the unit
rather than time of year. If you want a specific week during
high season, you’d best book it with the resort far in advance.
 Find out if the timeshare is certificate or deeded: Ownership
within the United States is typically deeded or fee simple. This
means that you own your interest in the resort. You get a deed
and you can pass it on to your heirs. A certificate or leased
timeshare gives you the right to use the timeshare for a pre-
scribed amount of years, usually 25 to 30. These are common
outside the United States.
 Find out the occupancy and how private the timeshare is:
Maximum is the number of guests the resort will accommodate,
private occupancy is the number of guests that can be accom-
modated (based on two adults) with a private bathroom.
 Find out what the maintenance fees are like: There are
annual maintenance fees paid to the resort. Somebody has to
pay for the upkeep, the utility bills, the taxes, insurance, cable
TV, and so on. Just like home.

Chapter 20
Getting Glitzy
In This Chapter 
 Finding great savings on jewelry
 Shopping that’s more convenient than a mall
 Finding men’s basics without the hassle
You wouldn’t know it by what I’m wearing now — but I adore
fashion. I love wearing new clothes and accessories — there’s
very little that feels better than going somewhere in a brand new
outfit. Wait a minute, yes there is, it’s when you pay less than half
of retail for your clothes and accessories.
I don’t earn enough money to support my fashion habit in the way
I’d truly like, but once more, eBay gives us the opportunity to get
on the glitz — without breaking the bank. In Chapter 13, I show you
how eBay helps you purchase wedding gowns at a sixth of the
retail price — and yes, this same kind of savings extends into all
areas of fashion — for both men and women.
Finding Sparkling Savings
on Jewelry
When I talk about shopping (or even selling) at eBay, I always tell
people to buy (or sell) what they know. If you know nothing about
what you’re looking for, there’s a far better chance of you spending
way too much for an item. 

Finding fine jewelry
If you’re looking for a specific type of piece, like an engagement
ring, I suggest you go to some retail stores before you browse eBay.
Get an idea of what you like. What catch phrases does the jeweler
use to describe your ring? Understand cut and clarity before you
go bidding up a ring at eBay.
Once you know what you’re looking for, spend time going through
the eBay listings. Odds are you will find exactly what you want —
for considerably less than Ms. Jeweler wanted to sell it to you for. 
When you plan to buy a special piece of jewelry at eBay, there are a
few things to keep in mind:
 E-mail the seller: More likely than not, some of your ques-
tions won’t be answered in the item description. Ask the
seller. You have the right to expect a quick and respectful
reply. A good seller will treat you as a good customer, and will
respond to your e-mail quickly. 
 Check the seller’s feedback: Is the seller an established jew-
elry seller? Or does his or her background refer to selling hun-
dreds of low-cost items? If you’re dealing with an established
seller who sells an occasional piece of jewelry, or an estab-
lished jewelry seller, you can probably trust the feedback
rating. If not, try another auction. (Check on the auction links
to see what the sellers have been selling.)
 Look for a warranty or a legitimate appraisal: Once the
seller has passed your feedback inspection, see if he or she
offers a guarantee that the description is correct. Also deter-
mine whether the seller will refund your money upon return
of the product if you discover a problem with the item.
 Ask for additional pictures: If you’re spending hundreds (or
even thousands) of dollars, you have the right to have clear
pictures of the item. If the auction does not have enough pic-
tures, ask the seller to e-mail you some more.
Figure 20-1 shows an auction from the eBay store One Source Gems
for some stunning diamond and platinum stud earrings at eBay. 
Note the way the seller gave a complete and thorough description
of the item for sale, and guaranteed the purchase.
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
226

Figure 20-1: These earrings from seller quality@onesourcegems.
com were appraised for $1,999 and sold for $600.
If you’re looking for lower-price “fun” (but real) jewelry, know how
much you’d spend for that item in a retail store. Then go online
and have fun. Just know your budget before you bid.
eBay has a very active Discussion Board about jewelry. You can
ask questions there and you may get an expert answer — or not.
Realize that just because people sell a type of item, it doesn’t make
them true experts. I have sold jewelry in the past (and know quite
a deal about it), but am certainly not an expert! Visit the Jewelry
discussion board for ideas at: http://forums.ebay.com/db0/
forum.jsp?forum=32.
Finding classic and new watches
There is virtually no better place on earth to buy watches than
eBay! The prices are really discounted, and you can compare
brand and model to original retail. When you research your buying
in this manner, you know exactly what you’re getting.
Watches are also something that you should be careful about when
you buy. Check the seller’s feedback and follow all the caveats
listed above for fine jewelry.
Chapter 20: Getting Glitzy 227

There is also a fantastic market for classic fine watches at eBay.
But then again, if you don’t know anything about classic watches,
there is a chance you can pay more than you need to. If you’re
looking for a classic watch, there are several very thorough refer-
ence books (that are sold at eBay) that will teach you the back-
ground and history of the watch you’ve got your eye on. These
books also give you the key to the serial numbers and models, so
that when you see an auction you’ll have a better idea of what
you’re looking at, and know what questions to ask the seller. Check
out Figure 20-2 to see what kinds of steals you can find.
Bidding on vintage and
new costume jewelry
These days, costume jewelry is as collectible (if not more) as fine
jewelry. A few years ago, the famous designer (and very rich lady)
Gloria Vanderbilt had her “garage sale” of her extra costume jew-
elry at eBay. She’d collected many famous items throughout the
years and sold them to regular folks like you and me. It was from
her auctions that I learned about the classic jewelry designers.
Check out Figure 20-3 for a beautiful costume jewelry find.
Figure 20-2: I searched for Rolex and netted close to 
2,000 watches.
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
228

Figure 20-3: Stunning new necklace from seller superpriceonline.
Famous brands, jewelry designed by Miriam Haskell, Kenneth J.
Lane, Dior, Weiss, and Lisner all command high prices at eBay.
Today’s designers of elegant costume jewelry, like Joan Rivers,
Judith Mack, and Nolan Miller are appearing on the site and are
quickly growing in value.
Chapter 20: Getting Glitzy 229
The watch that didn’t come in
My husband visited our “family” jeweler. You know, the guy who you trust and go
over to when you want something special and you don’t want to get ripped off; the
jeweler you trust. Interestingly, both my husband and I treated this same jeweler as
our “family” jeweler before we even met each other — so we both really trust him.
Anyway, my husband went into the store and found a super-looking watch — and
bought it. It was one of those new Citizen Eco-Drive watches (the kind where the
crystal is a solar cell, and you don’t have to replace batteries). The jeweler showed
my husband a picture of a stunning ladies watch of the same type, in gold with dia-
mond accents.
My husband didn’t order it (luckily) and came home to tell me about it. I searched
eBay and found the exact watch — brand new, still in the box — for half the dis-
counted off-retail price our jeweler would have sold it to my husband for when it
came in. I don’t dare wear the watch when I visit our “family” jeweler, but I’m darn
proud that I got such a deal!

Finding Mall Fashion
from Your Home
If there is one category that I visit more than any other at eBay, it’s
fashion. Everything you wear, from elegant men’s suits to mink
coats, can be found here at incredible discounts. Not everything
you find online is used stuff either — over 52 percent of items
listed in this category at eBay are brand new.
All you have to know is that an item exists, and you can find it
here. In 2002, there were $420 million dollars in sales in the eBay
apparel category alone. The people who run the eBay apparel
category tell me that:
 A pair of Nike shoes sells every 2 minutes.
 A Coach handbag sells every 4 minutes.
 A pair of Levi’s jeans sells every 1.5 minutes.
Those are some pretty amazing figures. Seems that the fashion
cognoscenti are seriously shopping for their fashion at eBay.
Be sure you know your size in a particular brand when you buy it
at eBay. When I search eBay for certain brands, I know what size I
wear, so there’s no mystery when the item arrives as to whether
it will fit.
Women’s apparel
From top to bottom it’s here at eBay. Here you can find lots (as in
a lot — a single item for several of the same thing) of brand new
lingerie. All things we like to buy in multiples!
Not only that, but clothing and shoes of every make and designer
are here. As a matter of fact, the second most searched search
term at eBay is Gucci!
When you go to the Clothing and Apparel link from the eBay home
page, you’ll end up on the hub page shown in Figure 20-4.
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
230

Figure 20-4: The eBay Clothing, Shoes, and Accessories hub page.
Ladies, there’s lots of stuff you can be buying here:
 Lingerie: Did you know that the waitresses at Hooters wear
special pantyhose that help their gorgeous legs look even
better? Well, they do, and guess what — we can buy them at
eBay! (Without ever having to go into Hooters — shudder).
Speaking of pantyhose, did you know they make pantyhose
without feet (so that you can stay smooth but still wear san-
dals?). Yep, they’re called Spanx, and they cost around $20 in
stores, but you can buy them brand new at eBay for close to
half price.
There are also lots and lots of Victoria’s Secret closeout, new
merchandise on the site. And don’t forget misspellings! I just
ran the search victories secret and got 1,832 items!
 Nightwear: Name brand pajamas like Karen Neuberger, and
Nick and Nora are awfully pricey and hard to find in stores —
at eBay they are plentiful and go at big discounts!
 Casual wear: If Levi’s sell so quickly — you can imagine how
fast the Tommy Bahama or Jam’s World items sell. That is
when you can find just the one you want!
 Designer dresses: If you know the brand, you can find the
designer at eBay. No matter where they are from or what they
Chapter 20: Getting Glitzy 231

sell! Search by manufacturer’s name, as I sit here I’ve searched
a bunch of popular brands; ABS, Due per Due, Moschino,
Banana Republic — you name it. I found items from each one
at eBay!
 Shoes and purses: You can find every major designer’s mer-
chandise at eBay at prices most of us can afford. When it
comes to shoes, be sure you know your size before you buy!
Many shoe auctions are final. Where else can you get a new
pair of Jimmy Choo or Manolo Blahnik shoes for under $100? 
I could keep on listing items, but I think you’ve gotten the idea. You
can find whatever you want from Target’s Mossimo to Neiman’s
Lulu Guinness!
Lots of very popular manufacturers are opening stores at eBay for
overruns and surplus inventory. Lately I’ve seen stores by Clio
(store name: 1010 Direct) and Chadwick’s Outlet, but there are
many more. Be sure to run your favorite designer’s name through
the store search as well as the eBay search so you’ll get all the bar-
gains. See more on stores in Chapter 15.
Once you get your favorite sellers and stores, you can store their
names on your favorites list in your My eBay page. Then, with a
click of the mouse, you can see what’s for sale. Figure 20-5 shows a
tiny section of what I found from one of my favorite stores.
Figure 20-5: Items closing today in the evalueville store.
Part VI: Going for the Gold 
232

Getting men’s basics
without the hassle
If most men are like my husband, they really don’t like to go shop-
ping. If my husband needs shirts, he’ll go to the store and find a
shirt he likes and then buy it in every color. Same thing with shoes.
It doesn’t really make for a fashion-forward look. I’ve found that I
can go onto eBay and select some really great looks for him. I usu-
ally just slip the new stuff — as it arrives from the seller — directly
into his closet!
On the other hand, some men just love to shop — and you guys
will really like eBay. Just plug in your favorite designers or manu-
facturer, and just like the women’s clothes, you’ll find way more
than you need or want! Take a look at Figure 20-6. This item is from
the seller gothamcityonline, who lists hundreds (maybe thousands)
of items for men and women daily. I often shop its stuff for myself,
but it has an awesome selection for men!
Figure 20-6: Gothamcityonline’s great deal on Tommy Hilfiger swim 
shorts.

Chapter 21
Ten Things eBay Sellers
Want You to Know
H
ave you ever had something that you wanted to tell someone
that was so very important that you couldn’t stress it enough?
Something really earthshaking? (Like telling your kids that the sick
they feel after they get drunk is really not worth it.) I wanted to
name this chapter; “Ten Things Sellers Would Like to Tell Buyers
While Grabbing You by the Shoulders and Shaking You Violently.”
So now you know, these are very important tips to being a success-
ful shopper at eBay.
I e-mailed quite a few truly reliable sellers for suggestions for this
chapter. Not necessarily the big sellers, but the sellers who know
what they are doing. The ones with excellent feedback and quality
customer service.
All these sellers want to deal with savvy, smart, and informed
shoppers, and they want you to trust all sellers, which means that
they want you to ask questions, be suspicious, and above all,
remember: If something sounds like it’s too good to be true, it
probably is.
Identify Your Payment
Every eBay seller who has been selling on the site for any length of
time has received payments that they couldn’t possibly identify.
One of the sellers I spoke to about this chapter just received a
money order with no identification information. It was bought for
$16.94 and never signed or filled out, no eBay item number.
Nothing.

That’s why sellers suggest that you print your e-mail exchange or a
copy of the auction and send it with your payment. Be sure that
every payment you send has the following information:
 The item name and number
 Your eBay User ID
 The address the item is to be shipped to
 Remind the seller if you want the item to be sent insured
Without this information, a seller can’t be expected to send your
item to you in a prompt manner.
Also, print your information, deciphering someone’s handwriting is
a very specialized talent. 
Check Feedback Before You Bid
eBay has a great tool, the seller’s box on the item page, which tells
you the percentage of positive feedback a seller has received. But
that box just gives you a summary. To get the complete picture,
you must click the number after the seller’s name or the Read All
Reviews in the line below the seller’s ID.
Check to be sure that the leopard didn’t change his stripes (or was
that the zebra?). Be sure that the last few feedbacks are not nega-
tive, and that the negatives are for dangerous situations. Look for
red flags, such as references to non-shipment of items and non-
response to e-mail after a payment. Read the negatives.
If a seller has some negative feedback, be sure to go through it. See
if the seller isn’t in the clear because the feedback is followed up
with an update that says Oops. Sorry for leaving negative
feedback. The item arrived safely. Thank you. (For more
information on feedback, see Chapter 5.)
Take a Time-Out Before Leaving
Negative Feedback
Has your package not arrived as yet? Did the item arrive and it
wasn’t exactly as you expected it? Was the item damaged in transit,
and is there no clue on the package that the seller purchased insur-
ance for the shipment (as you requested?). Take a deep breath and
count to ten.
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
238

Before you start drafting a short, stinging feedback message, com-
municate with the seller. E-mail the seller immediately. Politely,
please.
Don’t get emotional; just state your case and give the seller the
opportunity to make things right for you.
If e-mail is too slow (even though it’s best not to communicate
while you’re seething), go to eBay’s search page and click the Find
Members link to (from the Navigation Bar at the top of the page).
Scroll down to the contact info area. Input the item number for the
transaction, as well as the seller’s User ID — and click Submit.
eBay e-mails you the seller’s telephone number, and your number
will go to the seller.
Just like for our government, diplomacy will work for you. Most
sellers (you did check their feedback before you bid, right?) will
bend over backwards for their customers so as to protect their
reputation at eBay.
Give the seller the chance to make your transaction a pleasant one.
Don’t permanently ruin his or her online reputation because you
got caught up in the moment. For the first 24 hours after you get an
item, practice your deep breathing techniques and believe only the
best about the seller you’re working with. Give him or her a chance
to respond positively.
About 90 percent of negative feedback is given by newbies. Be in
the top 10 percent of your class!
Check for an eBay Store
When you’ve decided to buy a Buy It Now item, or bid on a seller’s
auction, double-check to see if the seller has an eBay store. Look
for the small red store tag after the seller’s name. If he or she has
an eBay store, click on the red tag, and you’ll be taken to the
seller’s store. Sellers often list the very same items in their eBay
store for a lower Buy It Now price. Why? It costs them consider-
ably less to list items in their store, and they list more items.
Once you’re in the store see if the seller has the items you want
listed in their store as Buy It Now items. (You wouldn’t see these
items listed on an eBay search.) Just type a keyword from the
item title in the search box in the store. You can save money by
clicking your mouse, and taking an extra minute. It’s definitely
worth it.
Chapter 21: Ten Things eBay Sellers Want You to Know 239

Purchase Multiple Items
from a Seller
If you’ve found an item you want to buy, or if you’ve just won an
auction, be sure to click on the link in the seller’s box that says
View Seller’s Other Items. Often, sellers sell other items related to
the one you’ve just won, and you may just find something else that
appeals to you. If the seller had the good taste to sell a certain type
of item, perhaps he or she has other like interests as you do.
If you see another item you want, be sure to e-mail the seller saying
that you would like the items shipped together, and ask the seller
to give you the amount due for combined shipping.
Also, if you intend to pay via PayPal, ask the seller to send you a
combined PayPal invoice. If you pay for each item individually, the
seller will incur extra, unnecessary charges from PayPal for multi-
ple transactions — rather than for one combined sale. 
Be Vigilant When Using Escrow
Most eBay transactions go through without a problem. But sadly,
one of the easiest places for fraud to occur when you’re buying
online is when you are purchasing the most expensive of items.
Buyers and sellers can often save themselves a bunch of grief if
they run their high-dollar transaction through an escrow company.
Here’s the rub. The Internet has been inundated with make-believe
escrow companies. Unscrupulous sellers will set up a Web site
with information copied from a real escrow site, and act as an
escrow company. They take your money and keep the merchandise
(if it ever even belonged to them).
Smart, honest sellers want you to know about the scammers —
better-educated bidders will seek out only the finest sellers, thus
drumming up more business for the good guys.
Because you’re doing business at eBay, double-check on the eBay
site which escrow service they are recommending at the time. Go
to the eBay site http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/
escrow.html. Escrow.com is currently the escrow site of choice
for eBay transactions.
Be especially wary if a seller insists on using an escrow service
because it’s usually the buyer that insists on escrow — not the seller.
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
240

If You Worry About Receiving
Packages
A sad result of the problems in this day and age is that we are often
uncomfortable receiving unmarked packages. Even though you
may be expecting an eBay purchase in the mail, you may look with
worry at a particular package.
Ask the seller to e-mail you when he or she ships the package with
information as to how the package is being shipped. If he or she is
using delivery confirmation, ask for that number to be sent to you
in the shipping confirmation e-mail.
The good ones will not blink. They’ll just do their best to accom-
modate you.
Please, Read the Description
When you are interested in an item, be sure to read the descrip-
tion. Some sellers do have overly long descriptions, and it’s a pain
to read the entire thing. But if you are interested in buying an item,
you must slog through the entire thing to be sure you know about
the item and are comfortable with the shipping and terms of sale.
Many times sellers get e-mails (I am guilty of sending these e-mails,
too!) asking questions that are answered in the item description.
Buyers often miss out on great deals because they were waiting for
an answer that was given in the description.
Also be sure you are comfortable with the shipping amount. If the
shipping amount is not listed, e-mail the seller by clicking the Ask
Seller a Question link. Ask the seller how much shipping would be
to your zip code. Shipping cost is part of the cost of your item and
you have a right to decide whether you feel it is reasonable, before
you place a bid.
If you have more questions about an item’s condition or value (or
that photographs are accurate) be sure to get confirmation from
the seller via the e-mail link before placing your bid.
Know What You’re Bidding On
Educated bidders are more fun (and less time-consuming) for sell-
ers to deal with. And unless you don’t worry about wasting money,
Chapter 21: Ten Things eBay Sellers Want You to Know 241

it’s smart for you to know about the item you want to buy. Here’s
what you should know:
 If it is an item you can currently buy at a local store, but
buying at eBay is more convenient, be sure you’re not
paying too much of a premium for having it delivered to
your door. Call your local store and see if it has it and how
much it is.
 If the item is an article of clothing, be sure it is the size you
require. You can ask the seller if that brand runs large or
small, but it’s best to buy brands with whose sizes you are
familiar. Also, if you don’t like going to the dry cleaner, e-mail
the seller to see if the item is washable. 
 Don’t assume the item is new unless the seller says so.
 If the item is a collectible, be sure that it is as rare as you
think it is. Run an eBay search on completed items to see how
many sold within the last two weeks at eBay, and see how
much other buyers paid.
Beware of Unsolicited Offers
Your bids at eBay are public record, and anyone can tell what you
are bidding on (unless it is a private auction). Sometimes sellers
scour the auctions and contact bidders to sell them a similar —
or exactly the same — item for a lower price. Rather than putting
their items up for sale, and paying eBay fees, these unscrupulous
sellers choose to undercut other reputable seller’s sales.
By participating in this bidder-stealing practice, sellers can avoid
paying fees to eBay. Sadly, if you choose to accept one of these 
off-eBay transactions, you are not protected under the eBay Fraud
Protection Program and cannot use the eBay feedback system. You
are completely on your own.
If you find this form of solicitation annoying, you can report the
user to eBay through the Customer service e-mail reporting link
(http://pages.ebay.com/help/basics/select-RS.html).
The quickest way to contact eBay Customer Support is to click a
feedback star anywhere on the eBay site and scroll to the bottom
of the page that appears. Then click the link.
It is a violation of eBay policy for a seller to solicit sales, and sell-
ers may be suspended for using this tactic.

Chapter 22
Ten Really Great Things
About Shopping at eBay
I
could come up with a bunch of reasons that shopping at eBay
is fun, or special or even sensible. I’m not the average eBay
shopper. Since I’ve begun writing books about eBay in 1999, eBay
has become a big part of my life.
Writing, teaching at eBay University, consulting — yes, eBay defi-
nitely takes up time. I finally gave up a very successful marketing
and advertising business so that I could devote the appropriate
amount of time to eBay — and my readers.
But I really enjoy it. I love the buyers and sellers; I love testing new
marketing ideas on the site; seeing people’s businesses grow. I hear
from people when they are about to start an eBay business — and
I love to hear from them again when they’re successful. That’s hap-
pened more times than I can count.
So I’d like to start off this chapter by saying that the first great
thing (for me) about shopping at eBay is that it changed my life.
It’s done that for many people who have changed careers and are
selling at eBay. Part-time businesses became good sized — even
large. So thank you, eBay.
I contacted some more of my fellow eBay shoppers to find out
what they find is special about shopping on the site. So here are
ten (or so) reasons to shop at eBay.

You Can Find More Choices
Than at the Mall
When you log on to eBay to find something, odds are you’ll think
of something else you want. There are close to 10,000,000 items up
for sale each and every day on the site. New things, old things,
used things and rare things. There are items to drive, vacations to
go to and items to wear. 
You can find something to make anyone happy at eBay — because
it is all there. From welding kits to wedding gowns, signed first edi-
tions to new books hot off the press. You can buy the toy you
always wanted as a kid, that your parents wouldn’t (or couldn’t
afford to) buy. You can buy your child the book you treasured in
school that you could never find again.
If you stretch your imagination, you can come up with (and find)
the most outrageous of items that you never even thought existed.
It’s all for sale; from birth to death; at eBay.
This Mall Never Closes
You can shop at eBay at any hour of any day. If you can’t sleep at
night, you can look for the replacement filter for your air condi-
tioner at 2:30 in the morning.
You Don’t Need to Dress Up
No one cares if you’re in your pajamas or in a tuxedo — although
I know of no eBay shoppers that shop in their tuxedos. (If you do,
please drop me a line.) Most of the buyers and sellers prefer a
more casual look. But then it makes no difference — it’s just you
and the Internet.
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
244

You Don’t Have to Deal with
Pushy Sales People
Okay, I guess if you’ve read enough descriptions at eBay auctions
you do notice that some sellers can be a bit pushy. Maybe not just
some and maybe not just a bit.
But the best part of eBay is that if you don’t like the attitude the
seller projects in his or her text, you can click your mouse and find
a nicer, friendlier seller selling your item.
You Can Shop the World Over
If you’re looking for an item from another country, you might find it
at eBay. But if you go to one of the international sites:
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and
the United Kingdom
You might get closer to finding just what you’re looking for. (I find
my favorite ketchup potato chips at eBay Canada.) You might even
try searching the foreign sites for old recipes and more.
To get to the international sites on the eBay home page, scroll
down the page. The links to the sites are in the lower left-hand
corner of links, just below the categories.
You’re Joining a Community
The eBay community, via the chat rooms and discussion boards,
can become a whole second social life for members who spend
time there. People meet at pre-assigned hours, and discuss eBay
and world events. It’s like a town square — just find one you like
and join in. 
Chapter 22: Ten Really Great Things About Shopping at eBay 245

You can visit international boards as well. I enjoy visiting the
United Kingdom boards. I have family over there, and it’s nice to
meet people from other countries. If you speak foreign languages,
you can join the fun at the international eBay site’s chat rooms.
You won’t find them in every country — but give it a try. eBay is
always adding new features.
You Can Give Back to Non-Profit
Organizations
You can have more fun buying very unique things, and the money
goes to charity. There are many charitable organizations that are
selling their wares at eBay to raise money for their fine work. You
can get some very rare and unusual items here, like the annual
NBC Today Show Green Room autograph book. This one-of-a-kind
book has signatures and notes from the famous guests of the Today
Show. The 2002 edition was sold in January 2003 and had over 500
autographs. It sold for $27,100 and benefited the Boys and Girls
Clubs of America.
eBay recently partnered with the leader in online charitable auc-
tions, MissionFish. Since 2000, MissionFish has helped organiza-
tions turn donations into cash through online auctions.
MissionFish will be working with regular eBay sellers to raise
money for non-profit organizations.
Late in 2003, sellers will begin to be able to pick a benefiting non-
profit from a certified list, and designate a percentage of the pro-
ceeds (from 20 to 100 percent) to donate, when they list an item at
eBay. These items will appear in the search results with a Charity
Auction icon. When you go to the item page, you’ll see the name of
the non-profit and some information about it, and the percentage
of the final bid that the seller is donating. You can search eBay for
your favorite non-profits by name.
You Can Use the eBay Toolbar
If you really get into eBay and want to keep track of items, and
have an instant link to eBay — at any time — you might want to
download the eBay Toolbar. The eBay Toolbar becomes part of
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
246

your Internet browser and allows you to connect to eBay at the
click of your mouse. See Figure 22-1 to see it in action.
Figure 22-1: My eBay Toolbar, revealing my drop-down Watch list.
You search eBay for anything that pops into your mind by typing it
into the small search box and clicking Search eBay. You can click
on any of the blocks to get to your bidding and Watch list.
Figure 22-2 shows the small box that pops up in the corner of your
screen 10 minutes before your watched auction closes to give you
a chance to snipe!
You can download the toolbar for your computer at http://pages.
ebay.com/ebay_toolbar/.

time to click here to snipe.
Chapter 22: Ten Really Great Things About Shopping at eBay 247

You Can Express Yourself
A new hobby has hit the Internet. Not just the one about passing
on wacky, joke e-mails, it’s passing on links to wacky auctions. Has
anyone sent you an e-mail showing you something strange up for
sale at eBay? Well, once you get onboard, and have friends who
also use eBay, you’ll be treated to some gems of madcap auctions.
Most of those auctions that you read about in the newspaper or
hear about on TV are real. Here are a few of the recent auction
titles:
Invisible Gold Fish — Matched Pair
PANCREAS COFFEE MUG . . . IT’S WEIRD & WONDERFUL!
Paper Origami Boulder
Nudist family activities needlepoint. Framed
FOR SALE: 24 SMALL CHILDREN
Fully functional kidney for donation
Young Man’s Virginity. Please look
Of course, some were in violation of eBay policy and ended by the
site; others were just plain funny!
