How the nervous system is organized 

PNS: cranial nerves, spinal nerves 
 
afferent neurons are sensory (transmit information to the CNS)   
efferent neurons “cause” change (transmit information away from the CNS).

Nervous System Organization 

Types of sensory input:  
Sensory systems: Vision, Hearing, Taste, 
Equilibrium, Olfaction, Somatosensation,  
(also visceral stimiuli like pH and O2 content of 
blood, osmolarity, blood glucose) 
 
Somatosensation receptors in skin, muscle 
and bones & visceral receptors (in organs) 
detect pain, temperature, touch, pressure, 
and proprioception  
(joint capsule, tendon, and muscle stretch).

Key Concepts 
 
The nervous system is composed of the brain, spinal 
cord, cranial nerves and spinal nerves. The first two make 
up the CNS, the latter two constitute the PNS.  
 
The CNS and PNS constitute a reflex arc. The CNS (brain 
& spinal cord) integrates sensory input (PNS) and 
provides appropriate output to effectors (PNS).  
 
The efferent portion of the PNS is divided into somatic 
and autonomic nervous systems. Somatic innervates 
skeletal muscle to cause contraction. Autonomic nervous 
system (ANS) is divided into sympathetic, 
parasympathetic and enteric.  Sympathetic (SNS) and 
parasympathetic act reciprocally and in opposition 
(accelerator & brake). Enteric division acts independently 
in the gut but can be modulated by the other divisions of 
the ANS. SNS is “fight or flight”; ParaSNS is “rest or 
digestion”.
