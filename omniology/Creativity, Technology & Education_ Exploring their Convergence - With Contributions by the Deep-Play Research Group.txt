The foundation of who we are today

Foreword
Creativity and technology are to blame for most of the world’s current problems. 
Every new discovery can potentially lead to disaster. Without cars, for example, 
there would be no car accidents, far less pollution, and no deaths in wars over oil. 
Without Twitter and Facebook, there would not be demagogues elected into high 
offices through the use of “alternative facts,” received through the echo chambers of 
carefully crafted social media feeds.
Actually, creativity is the sole source of disasters, disruptions, and damages to 
the environment and humanity, for it is human creativity that has led to the develop-
ment of technology, which led to the disasters, disruptions, and damages that 
humanity suffers from today. Creativity is very bad. It should be banned.
But creativity cannot be easily banned because creativity is what makes humans 
human. It is a gift or a punishment, from either evolution or God (depending on who 
you ask). Every human is born with creativity, so that they learn to survive—just as 
every fish is born with the capacity to swim. So unless we can renegotiate the deal 
with evolution or God, human beings will always be creative. It cannot be banned in 
nature.
Creativity, however, can be suppressed. Though it is part of our nature, creativity 
can be suppressed, like all innate potentials, through nurture. Without water and 
light, an acorn’s potential to become an oak tree is seriously reduced. Suppressing 
creativity in others has always been the goal of a few powerful and wealthy indi-
viduals in order to perpetuate their own power and wealth in human history. A vari-
ety of means, some very creative, have been employed to suppress creativity in the 
populace. Those who refuse to be suppressed can be silenced or exterminated 
through expulsion, jailing, crucifixion, or other extreme measures.
The most effective means to suppress creativity in modern days is schooling. In 
the name of education, which is supposed to help every individual grow their poten-
tial (including the creative potential), modern schools have been tasked with stunt-
ing creativity and reducing individual differences. Frederick the Great let out the 
secret intention of education: “An educated people can be easily governed” (cited in 
Jones, 2012, p. 87).

viii
To effectively stunt creativity, modern societies have developed a sophisticated 
system of schooling that utilizes such features as uniform curricula, standardized 
testing, mechanized teaching, and dehumanized teachers, to ensure that the compli-
ant are rewarded and encouraged and the ones who refuse to conform purged. 
Operating as and for a flawed meritocracy (Zhao, 2016), educational institutions 
reward the obedient with good grades, high scores in tests of prescribed subjects, 
admissions to (elite) colleges, and ultimately employment opportunities. The less 
compliant and perhaps more creative children, those who do not turn in their home-
work exactly the same way as expected by the teacher or those who cannot read by 
third grade, are labeled as students needing remediation, which literally means “the 
correction of something bad or defective” (according to Dictionary.com1).
Technology has often been employed to perfect this vision of suppressing cre-
ativity through schooling. Modern schooling is in essence a web of technology. In 
fact, schooling has continuously and constantly sought to improve itself with tech-
nological advances. With big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and 
globally connected smart devices, technology can now help schools to do their job 
more effectively and efficiently. Uniform curriculum can be more easily imposed on 
all children across the globe. Standardized tests can be more efficiently scored for 
single correct answers and processed so children can be more easily labeled and 
sorted. More precise actions can be taken to spot deviation and deliver remediation 
as early and soon as possible through sophisticated tools such as learning analytics. 
It is becoming harder and harder for creativity to survive in this technology-centered 
educational system.
Ironically, creativity is the only thing human beings have to get out of the mess 
made by creativity. To solve the problems facing humanity today, human beings 
must be creative. The genie of creativity has escaped the lamp and cannot be put 
back. Thus we need more creative geniuses to mitigate the damages—to make cars 
safer, to power them with cleaner fuel, and to discover new ways to repair the envi-
ronment. We also need more creativity to make better Twitters and Facebooks. But 
more importantly, we need more creative education to develop more creative people 
who can think independently and critically.
Human society, at this moment, cannot rely on just a few creative individuals. 
The challenges are too big and daunting. They require all members of the human 
race to be creative. Mass creativity is a necessity.
It is encouraging to see the rapidly growing interest in cultivating creativity for 
all. But it is disappointing to see governments continue to make schools improve its 
capacity for killing creativity, often using the most advanced technologies.
We need to rethink creativity, rethink schooling, and rethink technology in 
schools. This is precisely what Punya Mishra, Danah Henriksen, and their col-
leagues set out to do here. In a collection of beautifully written essays, Mishra, 
Henriksen, and the Deep-Play Research Group challenge myths about technology 
and creativity, debate time-honored instructional practices, and play with new ideas 
for schools to care for and nurture, rather than constrain, creativity. These essays are

If there is one thing that the study of creativity has taught us, it is that diverse per-
spectives, viewpoints, and collaboration are essential to the creative process. This 
book is no exception. There are a wide range of people without whose support, time, 
and creativity this book would not have existed.
First and foremost are the members of the Deep-Play Research Group—an infor-
mal group of faculty members and graduate students which originated at Michigan 
State University and now also include faculty and students at Arizona State 
University and Iowa State University. The chapters in this book are based on articles 
written by members of the group (under the leadership of the two authors) that 
appeared in the journal TechTrends, as part of a series titled Rethinking Technology 
and Creativity in the 21st Century. We have provided the names of specific authors 
of these original articles and a complete citation at the end of each of the chapters. 
For the record, the authors, in alphabetical order, are William Cain, Chris Fahnoe, 
Danah Henriksen, Megan Hoelting, Rohit Mehta, Punya Mishra, Carmen 
Richardson, Sandra Sawaya, Colin Terry, and Aman Yadav.
The editors at TechTrends deserve our gratitude for their support. This series was 
initiated under the editorship of Dr. Abbie Brown and has continued under the edi-
torship of Dr. Dan Surry and Dr. Charles Hodges. We have greatly appreciated the 
freedom and support they have given us to explore and promote our thoughts and 
ideas in the pages of their journal. Thanks also to Dr. J. Michael Spector, Dr. M. J. 
Bishop, and Dr. Dirk Ifenthaler, series editors of the SpringerBriefs in Educational 
Communications and Technology, for agreeing to include this book in this series.
We also owe a debt to Dr. Yong Zhao, longtime friend and thought leader, for 
writing the foreword for this book. Readers of the foreword will immediately see 
why Zhao is so highly regarded for his refreshing independence of thought.

We would be remiss if we did not thank editors and others at Springer Publishing 
for all the work and effort they put into making this book a reality. What we naively 
thought was an easy task—taking our published articles and making them into a 
book—was anything but easy. This book would not have happened without their 
efforts. In particular, we owe a deep debt of gratitude to our project coordinator, 
Brinda Megasyamalan, for her efforts, grace, and perseverance.
A very special thanks to the latest member of the Deep-Play Research Group, 
Melissa Warr. Melissa read (and reread) each and every word of this book and 
brought both a persnickety attention to detail and a sense of the whole, helping con-
vert this collection of articles into a coherent book.
One of the pleasures of academia is the opportunity it provides to work with col-
leagues and friends on ideas, large and small. The debt that the two of us (Punya and 
Danah) owe to each other cannot be put in words. Talking, ideating, writing, and 
editing the ideas that went into these chapters have been some of the best moments 
of our intellectual lives. That said, we, Punya and Danah, would also like to let read-
ers know that any errors that can be found in these pages (and we are sure there are 
more than a few) are the responsibility of the other person.

“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where–” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

What is creativity? Why is it important? What does it look like across different 
­disciplines and contexts? What role does technology play, if any, in the creative 
process? And finally, what do creativity and technology have to do with education? 
These are the questions that underline this collection of articles.
These articles emerged from a series we (the lead authors and other members of 
the Deep-Play group) have been writing for almost 5 years now for the journal 
TechTrends. What this means is that every 2 months, we have aimed to offer some-
thing useful or have something interesting to say (in around 2500–4000 words) 
about creativity, technology, and education. When we first took on this task, this 
seemed an easy enough thing to do. However, as we quickly found, maintaining the 
constant pace of writing was challenging, because we needed to find a fresh and 
interesting angle on creativity to share every couple of months. We needed to be 
creative in our discussions of creativity and to craft these ideas in ways that could 
inform the field and the readers of the journal. Whether or not we succeeded is now 
for you the reader to judge, as we present a compendium of these ideas, reconsid-
ered and offered up in one cohesive volume. We did succeed, for the most part, in 
meeting every 2-month deadline. It has now been almost five years since we have 
been writing these columns, and we are proud to say that over this time period, there 

2
has been just one issue of TechTrends that does not have an article by us, which is 
somewhat compensated by one issue that actually ended up having two!
Once we were a couple of years into the writing of these articles, we realized that 
these articles could work well as a book—though, truth be told, we had not planned 
it that way. So this is the second of two books to emerge from this series, with hope-
fully more to come. The first book titled The 7 Transdisciplinary Cognitive Skills for 
Creative Education (Henriksen & the Deep-Play Research Group, 2017) focused on 
transdisciplinary thinking, and the seven cognitive skills we argue are important for 
creativity. This book has a broader focus. In this, we cast a wide lens hoping to broadly 
scan the landscape of creativity, technology, and their relationship to education.
The chapters in this book break naturally into four key parts: The first part 
(Chaps. 2, 3, and 4) offers a broad frame for thinking about creativity, technology, 
and education. The second part (Chaps. 5, 6, and 7) lays out our ideas on the com-
binatorial and transdisciplinary nature of creativity and then introduces the idea of 
(in)disciplined learning. The third part (Chaps. 8, 9, and 10) engages in a deep dive 
into (in)disciplined learning by providing examples from specific domains (engi-
neering, computational thinking, and mathematics) around transdisciplinary cre-
ativity. Finally, the fourth part focuses on the broader architecture which creativity 
functions within. By architecture, we mean the structures (physical and virtual) that 
contextualize and locate the work that we do.
Part I: Setting the Frame
The first chapter in this part (“Crayons Are the Future”) lays out specific misconcep-
tions that people have around the role of technology in the classroom and its con-
nection to creativity. In some sense, the entire book can be seen as addressing these 
misconceptions, teasing them apart, and offering other alternative and more nuanced 
perspectives to think about these interrelated issues. So chapter one frames much of 
what the book aims to do. The first myth we identify is that the technology tools that 
we have today should drive how we conceptualize teaching and learning in the 
twenty-first century. We suggest that given the rapid rate of change of technology, it 
is naïve to assume that the tools we have today will remain static. Clearly this has 
implications for how we think about deploying these tools in the classrooms and 
how we train teachers to use these tools for pedagogical purposes. This is what 
brings teacher creativity to the forefront, since teachers have to be prepared to uti-
lize tools they may have never experienced before in their classrooms. This idea lies 
at the heart of the TPACK framework as well (Mishra and Koehler, 2006).
The second myth we identify is that creativity can be taught in a content-neutral 
manner. This idea that creativity is a generic way of thinking, or a domain-general 
skill, has been debunked by most creativity research. Creativity is rooted in disciplin-
ary ways of thinking and requires deep foundational knowledge of subject matter. 
The important point for us as educators is that technical skills and knowledge, while 
necessary, are not sufficient, in and of themselves, to engender creative solutions.
1  Intro

The next chapter (“A NEW Definition of Creativity”) seeks to provide a more 
comprehensive and theoretically-practically grounded definition of creativity, than 
the diversity of existing definitions in the field. We then use this definition to provide 
a way of evaluating creative artifacts. We argue (based on existing literature) that to 
be a creative product, an artifact must be novel, effective, and whole. We then use 
this to develop a technique for evaluating creative artifacts, particularly in educa-
tional contexts. This rubric, we believe, would be of great use to educators who aim 
to do more open-ended creative projects with their students.
The last chapter in this part (“A Systems View of Creativity in a YouTube World”) 
seeks to expand the definition of creativity from being embodied in an artifact or 
individual by taking a systems view of the process and then considering how new 
technologies are reshaping the creative landscape. Csikszentmihalyi (1997) argued 
that creativity lies in the interaction between the individual, the domain, and the 
field. Creative work functions between these three areas and is produced and dif-
fused based on the judgments and interactions of people at those levels. The advent 
of new digital technologies, particularly networked technologies and social media, 
has upended the ways these three domains function in relationship to each other. 
New tools provide new ways not just of creating new artifacts but also new ways of 
disseminating these works more quickly and with less restrictions. Thus, they have 
created a new set of creators without gatekeepers, resulting in new issues that 
demand consideration by educators.
Part II: Combinatorial Creativity and (In)Disciplined 
Learning
The first chapter in this part (“On Being (In)Disciplined”) builds on the idea that 
creative ideas, even while rooted in a discipline, often come from the application of 
knowledge from outside the discipline. This is the combinatorial view of creativity, 
i.e., ideas emerge from the collision of ideas from different disciplines. Thus, the 
role of education is not just the acquiring of disciplinary knowledge but also of other 
domains such that they can be brought together in new and interesting ways. We call 
this indisciplined learning, i.e., learning that is grounded in the disciplines but also 
sensitive to other forms of knowledge.
The constructs of indisciplined learning and transdisciplinary skills offer a theory 
about where new ideas come from or the origin of the creative spark. The next two 
chapters in this part (“Twisting Knobs and Connecting Things” and “Revisited and 
Remixed”) expand on the idea that creativity is not a “magical” process but is com-
binatorial in nature in that creative people combine pre-existing ideas and concepts 
in unique and novel ways. We also argue that the advent of new technologies pro-
vides an expanded zone of possibility for putting together ideas, media, and artifacts 
in novel, effective, and whole ways that may not have been as easy to do so before.
Part II: Combinatorial Creativity and (In)Disciplined Learning

4
Part III: Putting in Context
The first chapter in this part (“Square-Peg, Round-Hole, Good Engineering”) focuses 
on the field of engineering and seeks to understand creativity in that domain by look-
ing at two influential innovators, Nikola Tesla and Steve Jobs. In each case, we dem-
onstrate the kinds of cognitive skills and knowledge of outside their domain allowed 
these individuals to demonstrate significant creativity energy in their lifetime.
The second chapter (“Of Art and Algorithms”) focuses on the new field of com-
putational thinking and argues that computing not only extends traditional forms of 
human expression but also allows the creation of new forms of expression. These 
new forms of expression emerging today have significant implications for how we 
engage and interact with machines. In fact, we suggest that machines can take on a 
role in the creative process itself—as partners to humans in a way. We provide 
examples of how computational thinking, combined with knowledge of a discipline, 
can lead to creative solutions that could not have been possible before.
The third chapter in this part (“Creativity in Mathematics and Beyond”) focuses on 
mathematical creativity by studying the lives of four prominent mathematicians, all of 
whom won the Fields Medal (the most prestigious prize in mathematics) in 2014. We 
discuss how each of these individuals used their past experiences, as well as knowledge 
of fields outside of mathematics, to expand and create within their mathematical work.
Part IV: The Architectures of Creativity
The first chapter in this part (“A Room of Their Own”) takes a user-centered view 
of the creative process, suggesting that observing and understanding the manner in 
which educators and learners construct their own (“naturally built”) spaces are 
something we should embrace. Users who question and subvert existing designs, 
and recreate them to reflect their own practices, can be a powerful impetus for cre-
ativity. We ground this discussion within the context of physical architectural spaces 
(the city of Brasilia) and blended/online spaces in classroom contexts.
The second chapter in this part (“The Architecture of Creative Learning Environments”) 
focuses on actual classroom settings to better understand contexts (both technological 
and structural) that support the creative process. We consider the affordances of new 
tools and technologies and the role of the learner. We end by describing an instrument 
that can be used to evaluate creative classroom environments.
The final chapter in this part (“Deep Convergence”) seeks to extrapolate from 
current trends in digital technologies (the idea of digital convergence) to its implica-
tions for learning and society at large. We end the book with an afterword, to ­parallel 
the foreword by Zhao, where we seek to articulate the broad themes that cut across 
the preceding chapters.

Conclusion
The chapters in this book cut across a wide swath of ideas—from engineering to art 
and from poetry to YouTube. This is not surprising since creativity provides value 
both within and across disciplines. It is often described as a key skill essential for 
success in the twenty-first century. What these examples (and chapters) have in 
common, however, is a belief that creativity is not just for the special talented indi-
vidual. Rather it is a skill that is available to everybody. It is not magic but rather the 
result of complex and nuanced processes that can be developed and strengthened, 
with connections both to education and technology. New tools and technologies 
provide contexts and opportunities for greater creativity, but it will not happen just 
through the introduction of new tools. Thoughtful pedagogy considers what creativ-
ity looks like across subject matters and situations—seeing both the idiosyncrasies 
of circumstance or perspective and the commonalities that span the construct. 
Creativity is contextual and grounded in disciplinary knowledge, yet it requires the 
ability to look across disciplines. We hope that the ideas in the book will be of use 
to educators and practitioners as they seek to incorporate more creative work in their 
personal and professional lives.

Crayons Are the Future
Technology is nothing. What’s important is that you have a faith in people, that they’re 
basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they’ll do wonderful things with them.
~ Steve Jobs
Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, 
the teacher is the most important.
~ Bill Gates
The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what 
they want to do. It lets people be creative. It lets people be productive. It lets people learn 
things they didn’t think they could learn before, and so in a sense it is all about potential.
~ Steve Ballmer
Introduction
The past few decades have seen a tremendous burst of creativity and innovation 
fueled by digital technologies. From Google to Facebook and from cloud comput-
ing to tablet devices, new technologies have had an immense impact on how we live, 
work, and communicate. These new tools, devices, and applications, when com-
bined with the economic and social pressures of a global society, are ushering in 
whole new world. Given these issues of creativity and technology, it is not surpris-
ing that educators (particularly those who are technologically inclined) have argued 
that teaching and learning in this emerging world need to emphasize these twin

issues—technology and creativity. Thus, it is important to explore the relationship 
between technology and creativity, particularly in educational contexts.
This relationship is noteworthy because both technology and creativity in educa-
tion are complex areas, which have confounded many legitimate attempts to find 
useful approaches to integrating them into educational settings. Despite these com-
plexities, we do believe that developing a better understanding of the connection 
between them is important. In this paper, we identify some concerns (or misunder-
standings) about how these two issues are typically framed and described. From 
there, we will offer a two-part framework (that of TPACK and transdisciplinary 
creativity) arguing that these two parts make up a larger whole, which provides a 
useful way to think about creativity and technology for teaching and learning. We 
begin by describing a few myths about technology and creativity.
Myth 1: The Technology Tools We Have Today Should Drive 
How We Conceptualize Teaching and Learning in the Twenty-­
First Century
Digital technologies have increasingly become a part of the way we work and play. 
From smartphones to Internet technologies and from YouTube videos to multiplayer 
games like World of Warcraft, technology is center stage in our lives and interac-
tions (Mishra, Koehler, & Henriksen, 2011). Most discussions of educational tech-
nologies and twenty-first-century learning tend to focus on the newest and coolest 
tools around. For instance, Web 2.0 is often mentioned, as are other social media

such as Twitter, Facebook, wikis, and blogs (Yardi & Boyd, 2010). There is a fun-
damental problem with seeing these new technology tools as driving educational 
practice. This involves the assumption that the technologies we have today (the 
second decade of the twenty-first century, when this book was written) should deter-
mine what and how we should be teaching our students. But a century is a long time. 
Imagine if education in the twentieth century was based on tools and technologies 
that emerged early in that century. A quick Google search (or two) later, we have 
Table 2.1, a list of key innovations that occurred between 1901 and 1915 (to parallel 
the first 15 years of the twenty-first century).
There are many examples in this table that we could point to, but we will draw 
attention to the year 1903 which saw the invention of the crayon. The crayon is a 
wonderful educational tool—of value from elementary school onward. However, to 
think of the crayon (or any of the other tools mentioned in the list) as being of foun-
dational significance to twentieth-century education is clearly naïve. Heavy empha-
sis on the tools and technologies of the early twenty-first century (Twitter and wikis 
are two examples) as the basis of education in this century is just as misguided. Do 
we really think that technological innovation is going to stop as of today? Do we 
really believe that our approaches to teaching with technology revolve around what 
we think of as new or cool today?
Technology changes rapidly, and it is not surprising that its integration in educa-
tion still finds disappointing levels of penetration and success (Frank, Zhao, & 
Boreman, 2004; Gülbahar, 2007; Keengwe, Onchwari, & Wachira, 2008). To be 
used productively, teachers must understand the different ways that technology can 
represent content and recognize how this syncs (or doesn’t sync) with possible 
teaching approaches. The technical details of the digital world shift continuously, 
which is part of the problem. Technology over time has always been a moving tar-
get, which we cannot hope to hit if we view it as narrowly as that which is just “digi-
tal” or “modern.”
We argue that technology has been conceived of too narrowly, as being just 
things that are digital, modern, or computer-centric. The field of education has been 
“chrono-centric” in its view of technology (chrono-centric being the view that one’s 
own era or time in history is the most important or the only one that matters). 
Thereby, a major struggle in teaching with technology is that it is envisioned as 
making use of set of new gadgets, fads, devices, or features. But whether it’s a Stone 
Age tool, a Guttenberg printing press, the simple crayon, or a high-tech digital sim-
ulation, any form of technology is a tool for living, working, teaching, and learning. 
Each of these technologies has affordances and constraints, framed within broader 
educational goals. In the field of education, we must eschew the chrono-centric way 
of thinking about technologies and focus on what’s important and useful about any 
technology in the interaction with disciplinary content. Just teaching teachers about 
Web 2.0 or specific software packages is too shortsighted because those websites 
and software packages perpetually change (Mishra & Koehler, 2006). Instead, the 
focus should be on what it is that we want our students to learn and how that learn-
ing is to happen.
Myth 1: The Technology Tools We Have Today Should Drive How We Conceptualize…

12
This is where the TPACK framework comes into play. TPACK suggests that 
expert teachers have a specialized brand of knowledge, i.e., a blend of technological, 
pedagogical, and content knowledge. Thus, it is the interaction between knowing a 
technology, knowing about pedagogy, and understanding a subject matter that makes 
for effective teaching with technology (Mishra & Koehler, 2008). TPACK shatters 
this myth of technology as being “chrono-centric” and asks only that we focus on 
“what can your technology do for your content and what is the best way to do it?” 
The TPACK framework emphasizes the importance of teacher creativity in repurpos-
ing technology tools to make them fit pedagogical and disciplinary-­learning goals.1
This brings us to the second issue we wish to discuss—that of creativity. There 
are many myths associated with creativity, but in this context, we will focus on one.
Myth 2: Creativity Can Be Taught in a Content-Neutral 
Manner
If technology has advanced to the forefront of twenty-first-century learning discus-
sions, then creativity has been its partner in crime. Creative thought processes are 
considered increasingly necessary as criteria for accomplishment in the progres-
sively complex and interdependent twenty-first century (Robinson, 2003). 
Globalization has brought a dramatic increase in knowledge and technology, as well 
as demographic and social changes in our world (Florida, 2002). This has led to 
diverse knowledge bases and complicated issues that demand creative thinkers and 
innovative problem-solvers. Daniel Pink (2005) argues that the skills that were 
important in the information age (the so-called “left-brain” capabilities) are neces-
sary but not sufficient for the current emerging world. He suggests that “the ‘right 
brain’ qualities of inventiveness, empathy, joyfulness, and meaning increasingly 
will determine who flourishes and who flounders” (p. 3) in the future. In trying to 
respond to these creative demands, organizations such as the Partnership for Twenty-­
First Century Skills have aimed resources at infusing creative thinking into educa-
tion for the twenty-first century.
Yet for all its importance, creativity is a concept that has generally been considered 
“ill structured,” a “fuzzy zone” that is not well defined and hard for many people to 
grasp (Spiro, Feltovich, Jacobson, & Coulson, 1995). The role of creativity in educa-
tion has rarely been clear, and it varies greatly depending on schools and programs. We 
argue that this lack of structure and generalizability of creativity in education is partly 
because many have tried to make the concept too generalized, providing only broad, 
generic definitions that lack context or disciplinary differences. In this broad and fuzzy 
state, creative approaches are difficult to integrate. In order for creative endeavors to 
mean something in education, they must be grounded in disciplinary knowledge 
1 The TPACK framework has received a significant level of attention in the recent past, so we will 
not dwell on it. Interested readers can go to TPACK.org to learn more about the framework and its 
impact on scholarship and practice.

(Mishra et al., 2011). And yet, while these disciplinary differences exist and are impor-
tant to creative work, there are commonalities of critical thinking between disciplines. 
This creates a tension between the importance of disciplines and the need to transfer 
ideas between them for creative thinking. As Rotherham and Willingham (2010) 
argue, “Devising a 21st century skills curriculum requires more than paying lip service 
to content knowledge. Outlining the skills in detail and merely urging that content be 
taught, too, is a recipe for failure. We must plan to teach skills in the context of particu-
lar content knowledge and to treat both as equally important.”
Consider the fact that creativity in science or mathematics is essential, as surely 
as it is in art or music; and creative thinking skills between varying disciplines cer-
tainly have similarities (Caper, 1996; Root-Bernstein, 1996; Root-Bernstein & 
Bernstein, 1999). For example, consider the thinking skill of identifying/creating 
patterns: scientists look for, and construct, patterns, as do artists. But creativity in 
the sciences looks quite different from artistic creativity (and perhaps feels different 
in process). This is because differences in disciplinary knowledge, techniques, pro-
cesses, and norms influence creative outcomes in unique ways. So, what we need is 
a new framework for creative thinking. We need a conception of creativity that 
upholds disciplinary knowledge and differences but also uses certain thinking skills 
that look across disciplinary boundaries for creative solutions and outcomes.
Having identified these two myths, we now offer an approach and solution to the 
issue of teaching for creativity using technology. As described, the problem with 
creativity has been too broad a focus (on generic skills divorced from disciplinary 
knowledge), while the problem with technology in education has been a too narrow 
a focus (on today’s tools). We argue that these two problems have a single solution. 
To this end, we offer a realistic, flexible structure for working both within and across 
disciplinary contexts and the role that technology can play in making it happen. If 
we truly believe in the value of disciplinary learning (of deep content knowledge) as 
being essential for creativity, we need to think of technology use as being deeply 
integrated with content. What we need for technology in education is also what we 
need for creativity in education: a new framework for thinking creatively both 
within and across the disciplines—an “(in)disciplined” framework, as it were. We 
offer a broad draft of such an approach below.
Reconnecting Technology and Creativity Through (In)
Disciplined Learning
At the core of our approach is an understanding that even as we value disciplinary 
learning, there are cognitive-creative skills that cut across disciplinary boundaries. 
It stems from scholarship that demonstrates how creative scientists and artists gen-
erally use a key set of thinking tools work with disciplinary knowledge. As Root-­
Bernstein and Bernstein (1999) notes:
… at the level of the creative process, scientists, artists, mathematicians, composers, writ-
ers, and sculptors use… what we call “tools for thinking,” including emotional feelings, 
Reconnecting Technology and Creativity Through (In)Disciplined Learning

14
visual images, bodily sensations, reproducible patterns, and analogies. And all imaginative 
(and effective) thinkers learn to translate ideas generated by these. (p. 11)
It is from here that we derive the notion of (in)disciplined creative work, meaning 
that creative work always happens in a discipline or context, while understanding 
that, at the same time, it is indisciplined, i.e., cutting across the boundaries of disci-
pline to emphasize divergent thinking and creativity (Chap. 5 in this book explores 
this idea in greater detail).
We suggest that transdisciplinary creativity, alongside TPACK, can address cre-
ativity and technology for learning. Taken together, these two frameworks are 
enjoined into an inclusive, practical, and flexible structure for teaching creatively 
and effectively with technology. While the coming columns will delve into this topic 
in detail, we will wrap up here with an in(disciplined) example that draws upon both 
TPACK and transdisciplinary creativity: using the Kinect for teaching math.
The Kinect is a motion sensing input device developed by Microsoft for use with 
the Xbox 360 video game console or a Windows computer. Using a webcam-style 
sensor, users can control and interact with the console through gestures and spoken 
commands.
Embodying Mathematics
While math is ultimately grounded in number, modern mathematics is such a complicated 
creature that understanding its organic workings requires much more than the ability to 
count. There is a great and growing body of linguistic and visual metaphors that constitute 
a healthy understanding of modern math…mastery of these concepts often involves creativ-
ity more readily expected of a poet than of a scientist. (Bahls, 2009, p. 77)
Mathematics has often been seen as problem-solving by manipulating abstract sym-
bol systems. More recently, however, math educators and cognitive scientists have 
emphasized the embodied nature of mathematical thinking. These researchers have 
argued that sensorimotor action is the foundation of mathematical thinking. For 
instance, Lakoff and Núñez (2000) have suggested that abstract mathematical con-
cepts are grounded (through thinking in metaphor) to sensorimotor experiences 
based on perception and action in the physical environment. According to this view, 
mathematical concepts are actually multimodal spatial-dynamic simulations that 
engage different senses and different blends of these senses. Mathematical reason-
ing, procedures, and vocabulary do not emerge from a vacuum but rather build on 
these rich simulations (Abrahamson, 2006; Fuson & Abrahamson, 2005). Evidence 
for this view comes from studies of expert mathematical thinking, historical analy-
sis of mathematical discovery (Root-Bernstein & Bernstein, 1999; Wilensky, 1997), 
as well as studying the kinds of gestures made by teachers and learners as they 
explore mathematical ideas (Alibali & Mitchel, 2011).
This view of mathematics says much about how we should teach and learn math-
ematics. Clearly, traditional curricula where students find rote solutions to arithme-
tic problems (Schoenfeld, 1985) do not help them engage in deep and embodied 
2  Crayons Are the Future

15
mathematical reasoning. As Abrahamson (2006) argues, students should be engaged 
in deep multimodal learning that connects perception and action to deeper abstract 
ideas.
This embodied vision of mathematics is put into play in a research project con-
ducted by Robin Angotti and her team at the University of Washington Bothell. Dr. 
Angotti’s team has created a custom Kinect app to help teach students functions 
(such as distance, acceleration, velocity, etc.) by letting them plot these equations on 
a graph in real time using their bodies rather than merely graphing it with pencil and 
paper. Students move toward and away from the Kinect sensor, and their movement 
maps onto the screen. Essentially the software allows the user to graph using their 
position in relation to the camera. Moving closer makes the graph increase and step-
ping away from it results in the line sinking. The group has also developed a series 
of lesson plans for how this software can be used in the classroom.
Clearly the use of the software and the Kinect brings a new physical dimension 
to the learning of mathematics—aligning it with current scholarly work in the area 
of mathematical knowledge and development (as briefly described above). For 
instance, students in a fifth grade classroom were able to understand concepts such 
as rate of change without any prior instruction on the concept. As Dr. Angotti said, 
“[The students realized that] if a line was steep, then the rate of change was high and 
that means they would have to move faster … All of a sudden, they were talking 
about rate of change—and these are fifth graders; they don’t know rate of change 
yet” (Ureta, 2012).
This is a great example of how technology can powerfully change how and what 
we teach. The work by Dr. Angotti and her team shows TPACK in action: bringing 
together technology, pedagogy, and content in an original, innovative manner. More 
importantly, it allows students to view mathematics as few students have been able 
to do before—as abstraction embodied in physicality. This is an example of (in)
disciplined learning at its very best. It is firmly grounded in the discipline of math-
ematics (students are grappling with serious mathematics ideas) in a very unique 
and physically embodied manner. The kinds of understanding that emerge from this 
truly take advantage of twenty-first-century technologies for deep (in)disciplined 
learning. This is learning that breaks disciplinary boundaries to cross-pollinate 
ideas and thus helps students become creative divergent thinkers.

A NEW Definition of Creativity

ideas, and just like shoots, out of its eyes all kinds of beauty”

Introduction
When attempting to define pornography, Justice Potter Stewart of the Supreme 
Court famously said: “I know it when I see it.” This definition (or acknowledgment 
of the difficulty of constructing a definition) is similar to the way we often think 
about creativity. The idea that creativity defies definition, and yet is recognizable, 
speaks to the ineffable yet self-evident magic that seems to underlie the creative 
spark. As creativity becomes an important part of education, however, it is impera-
tive that we move beyond such generalizations toward a more precise definition. 
Such a definition would provide multiple benefits. First, it would allow us to develop 
a shared understanding of this important construct, and second, we could, given this 
shared understanding, begin to develop more precise evaluations of it. These twin 
goals (of definition and evaluation) are important as we think about the role of cre-
ativity in teaching and learning.
This chapter is edited and derived from the following article, which originally appeared in the 
journal TechTrends (with permission from the publisher and editor). With thanks and credit to the

A Problem of Definition
Creativity has long been recognized as a powerful force in shaping human society and 
driving progress and knowledge. As Victor Hugo once noted, “An invasion of armies 
can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come.” Yet, for all the historical basis 
of valuing creativity (a basis which stretches back to antiquity, with Plato’s concept of 
“the Muse”), the emphasis on creativity has never been as pressing, or as academi-
cally discussed, as it is in present day. Many authors have noted how the complexities 
of knowledge and technology in our modern world have heightened the need for 
creative thinkers (Florida, 2002; Pink, 2005). Educational scholars such as Cropley 
(2003), Sternberg (2007, 2008), Robinson (2003), and Sawyer (2011), among many 
others, have focused on the importance of creative thinking in the field of education. 
We concur with these ideas and, in Chap. 2, suggested that the creative imperative for 
education has never been more important than it is today, both in domains that have 
traditionally been viewed as “creative” such as the arts and just as much in areas such 
as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (Chaps. 8, 9, and 10 explore 
these ideas in greater depth with examples from specific disciplines).
Yet despite this renewed interest in creativity, researchers and theorists alike have 
struggled to concretely define the construct, thus lacking agreement on what it is 
and how it should be defined (Baker, Rudd, & Pomeroy, 2001; Friedel & Rudd, 
2005; Marksberry, 1963). For example, in an investigation of more than 90 articles 
from top peer-reviewed journals, all dealing specifically with the topic of creativity, 
Plucker, Beghetto, and Dow (2004) determined that only 38% of these articles 
offered an actual definition of the term creativity. This lack of a common definition 
of creativity prevents us from having a shared understanding of the construct. Are 
different people even talking about the same thing when they say a certain product, 
idea, or artifact is more or less creative than another? How are we to know?
In order to really understand what creativity means and how it functions within a 
discipline such as teaching, it is important to develop a meaningful definition. We 
offer below a definition by describing three important indicators or dimensions that 
underlie creative products. This definition builds on Besemer’s (1998) three-factor 
model for evaluating design creativity. These three definitional indicators are impor-
tant because they reveal how creativity can connect broadly with, and be judged 
within, multiple domains.
What Lies Within: The Components of Creativity
At the most general level, a creative idea or product is novel—it brings something 
into the world that did not exist before (at least in that particular form or arrange-
ment). These novel objects are often described as being surprising or original. See 
Table 3.1 for other synonyms or words related to this dimension of creativity.
3  A NEW Definition of Creativity

19
Mere novelty, however, does not make something creative. Novelty must be joined 
to “purpose” or usefulness. As noted musician and bassist Charles Mingus once said, 
“Creativity is about more than just being different. Anybody can play weird, that’s 
easy.” A novel idea with no potential use cannot be taken as “creative” (Cropley, 
2003). Novelty does not guarantee that something will be effective (Amabile, 1989, 
1996; Oldham & Cummings, 1996; Zhou & George, 2001). Useful, valuable, and 
understandable are some words that are used in connection with this dimension. See 
Table 3.1 for some other synonyms or words related to effectiveness.
A range of authors (Besemer, 1998; Besemer & O’Quin, 1999; Sternberg & 
O’Hara, 1999) suggested that though these two attributes (novelty and effective-
ness) are necessary, they are not sufficient. According to Sternberg and O’Hara 
(1999), another key characteristic is “task appropriateness,” while according to 
Besemer (1998), it is what they call “style.” Creative products (ideas, artifacts, etc.) 
are inherently sensitive to the context and to the domain they were created in. For 
instance, a creatively constructed mathematical proof and an ingeniously designed 
science experiment both look incredibly different; furthermore, they look different 
from any number of creative acts in fields like music, art, teaching, and so on. So, a 
thoroughgoing definition of creativity must also account for this contextual dimen-
sion, the style of the product, as it were.
As Mishra and Koehler (2008) have noted, “Creative solutions often go beyond 
mere novelty and functionality to include a strong aesthetic quality. Creative prod-
ucts and solutions are deeply bound to the context within which they occur; they are 
integrated, organic and whole.” Thus, Mishra and Koehler suggest wholeness (which 
involves the aesthetic dimensions of work, as situated with that work’s specific con-
text) as being a third dimension of identifying creative artifacts. Other words related 
to this dimension are organic, well crafted, and elegant (see Table 3.1 for more 
related words).
These three independent axes (novel, effective, and whole) provide us with a 
framework for defining creativity. In other words, creative solutions are novel, effec-
tive, and whole. Creative products (be they artifacts or ideas) are not just new or 
interesting, they are useful, and they have a certain aesthetic sensibility which is con-
nected to and evaluated within a specific context—the whole! This, serendipitously 
enough, gives us a new acronym to remember our new definition of creativity. A 
Table 3.1  The three components of a creative solution. From Mishra and Koehler (2008) (adapted 
from Besemer and O’Quin, 1999)

Novel
Fresh, unusual, unique, surprising, startling, astonishing, astounding, germinal, 
trendsetting, radical, revolutionary, influential, pioneering

creative solution is NEW, i.e., it is novel, effective, and whole; creativity is a goal-
driven process of developing solutions that are novel, effective, and whole.
Evaluating Creativity in Teaching, Learning, and Other 
Settings
Evaluations of creative work happen instinctively in the world around us. It is an 
innately subjective and human activity to observe, interact with, and make judg-
ments about objects or ideas in the manmade world of things. It is important, how-
ever, that we go beyond mere subjectivity in evaluating creative artifacts. As Lord 
William Thomson Kelvin once said, not being able to measure what it is that we are 
speaking of is a meager and unsatisfactory kind of knowledge. For this purpose, the 
goal of our research team has been to develop a rubric that would allow educators to 
evaluate the creativity of a given product.
We must distinguish what we are describing here from the more standard psy-
chometric approaches that seek to measure individual creativity. There are numer-
ous psychological measures that attempt to quantify a person’s individual creativity 
(or psychological capacity for creative thought). For example, the Torrance Test of 
creativity is one of the more common creativity tests and is designed as a psycho-
logical measurement of an individual’s divergent thinking. Our approach, however, 
is different in its purpose, in that we focus on the products of creative activity, i.e., 
we seek to evaluate the end products of creative process. These end products may 
include physical objects, concepts and ideas, or artifacts such as poems and theo-
ries. Our focus on artifacts highlights the philosophical proposition that it is what 
we do that matters, not what a test thinks we are.
Our emphasis on the end products of the creative process is driven by two rea-
sons. First, the process of creativity is often invisible to the outsider. What we have, 
at the end of the day, is what the creative process produces. And that is what we seek 
to evaluate. The second reason involves our focus on actual classroom contexts 
where educators must evaluate and pass judgment on student work. Though we 
value the importance of process, as educators we need to develop better measures 
and rubrics to speak coherently and systematically about the creative products that 
students develop. An increased emphasis on open-ended assignments and project-­
based learning makes this task even more important. By putting the spotlight on 
creative production, we are focusing on work that has tangible validity in a class-
room context.
Before we describe the work we have been doing on developing these rubrics, a 
few caveats may be in order. First, it is important to emphasize that, in accordance 
with the flexible nature of creativity, any rubric for evaluating creativity must itself 
be flexible and adaptive. Rubrics or evaluation systems for creativity cannot be nar-
row, rigid, or too standardized, but rather should provide a flexible guiding structure 
for thoughtful judgment on the dimensions of creative “quality.” Second, we must

also understand that creating such rubrics is fraught with risk in that rubrics can 
become too abstract and distant from the actual work under consideration, and we 
may end up with metrics that focus on information that is easily available rather 
than information that is truly important. In other words, we must be careful that we 
keep our focus on measuring what we value rather than valuing what we can easily 
measure.
A NEW Measure of Creative Artifacts
In our work with the Deep-Play Research group, we have been engaged in the 
development of such a “rubric” (Terry, Henriksen, & Mishra, 2013). We developed 
this rubric for research purposes, as part of an empirical examination of student 
creativity in one of our educational technology courses. Student participants in this 
course, “Creativity in Teaching and Learning,” developed their own artifacts for 
teaching subject matter. These artifacts ranged from content-related activities to les-
son plans, often including some creative way of looking at content or providing a 
new and innovative use of digital technologies. The rubric effectively provides eval-
uation guidelines along three key dimensions: novelty, effectiveness, and whole-
ness. Artifacts are given a score between 1 and 5 for each of these dimensions. The 
rubric provides definitions at each score point as well as providing examples (or 
anchor artifacts) to provide a sense of what may be expected at each point.
To develop this rubric, two researchers independently reviewed each project in 
our data set of over 350 student-generated artifacts produced over three iterations of 
the course. Once the researchers developed holistic sense of the data, they conducted 
a preliminary coding of a subset of the projects. This preliminary coding was sup-
ported by a series of back-and-forth discussions to develop a shared and consistent 
understanding of what each score along each of the three NEW dimensions would 
mean. Once consensus had been reached on the scoring guidelines for the projects, 
we performed an inter-rater reliability test by having the two coders independently 
code 10% of the projects. There was 87% agreement between the coders.
The rubric itself provides a definition for each score point and the selection of 
some “anchor projects” to exemplify the scores (i.e., anchor the coding with exam-
ples of what each score might look like). These definitions are relatively brief and 
intended to help any coder or scorer understand both a verbal description of the 
scoring and a more visual description offered by anchor examples. For instance, a 
score of “1” for novelty would offer “Lack of anything unique or novel and lack of 
content or substance to even offer opportunities for novelty,” while a score of “5” for 
novelty would offer “Strong qualities of uniqueness, in ways that could be exciting 
or interesting to learners, are very novel or different from other examples in the data 
set and show a relatively very novel approach to teaching of subject matter (in rela-
tive terms to other teaching artifacts/projects in the course).” We described the 
ongoing research endeavors around this work, rating a whole range of other artifacts

(Henriksen, Mehta, & Mishra, 2015).
Conclusion
In this chapter, we provided a NEW (Novel, Effective, Whole) definition of creativ-
ity as well as introduced a possible way of using this definition to create a contex-
tual, flexible rubric for evaluating creative products. While this is clearly a work in 
progress, it is through the use of such emergent and flexible structures for evaluating 
creativity that we hope to provide a way of measuring creative work in the class-
room. We understand that there always will be an element of subjectivity in this 
process, just as there is subjectivity in any open-ended, complex, artistic, or 
problem-­solving work or thinking. It is, however, important to have a structure to 
guide judgment and give each project or artifact a fair, systematic, consistent, and 
comprehensive assessment. This examination of the meaning and definitional com-
ponents of creativity, along with our current work in the evaluation of the products 
of the creative process, is meant to further the broad understanding of the topic and 
its role in teaching and learning.
Through the development of adaptive creativity evaluation schemas (such as our 
own example described here), we may offer a gauge for creative work that gives it 
an important place at the table of teaching. In this era of accountability, where cre-
ative approaches are slipping from the scene all too quickly, creative teaching needs 
all the support it can get.

Introduction
In 2005, Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox uploaded multiple lip syncs of famous pop 
culture theme songs to YouTube under their new channel name, Smosh. Many of the 
videos, particularly the lip sync of the Pokemon theme song, became some of 
YouTube’s earliest hits. Before being removed, the Pokemon theme was the most-­
viewed video on the site. Over the past 10 years, Padilla and Hecox have grown their 
brand internationally through self-directed videos. They have written and directed 
their own feature-length film and become household names. The two young mil-
lionaires represent a new generation of creative producers who use social media to 
distribute their product. As we have discussed in previous chapters, the ability to 
create new ideas, knowledge, and expressions requires being adaptable to

environment and flexible about tools and content (Chaps. 2, 5, 6, and 7 explore these 
ideas in greater detail).
There have been consistent developments in new technologies throughout human 
society (technologies in the broadest sense of the word as “tools to think with”); 
however, recent years have seen a comparative explosion of digital technologies. 
This rate of change and technological growth is quickly reshaping how we work, 
think, and act in the world (Cuban, 2009; Mishra, Koehler, & Henriksen, 2011; 
Zhao, 2012). Content or knowledge can now be created, shared, and discovered 
much faster and more easily.
As twenty-first-century technologies have contributed to globalization and diver-
sification of knowledge around the world, they have also begun to reshape the shar-
ing of idea, art, culture, and other forms of content. Such technologies offer much 
to the landscape of creative sharing, as we have seen in approaches such as Internet 
crowdsourcing of data or ideas; a constant new stream of applications for creating 
and sharing video, audio, images, and text across contexts; and websites devoted to 
sharing content (e.g., YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, to name a few).
In many ways, this infusion of new technologies for developing and sharing con-
tent has transformed how culture, art, and knowledge emerge within fields of inter-
est. Consider the example of the Smosh channel above, or many other content 
creators and curators in similar venues. Of course, there are still “experts” in tradi-
tional domains that may question the validity of these new creative displays, and 
communities of practice still have “gatekeepers”—those who decide what is and is 
not worthy of inclusion in the field and diffusion more broadly. We argue that new 
technological platforms allow producers to bypass traditional gatekeeping pro-
cesses, providing the opportunity to not only showcase creative skills but also to 
redefine a field’s classification of what is “high”-quality or creative work. We frame 
our discussion within Csikszentmihalyi’s systems view of creativity and how these 
new possibilities for creating and sharing may require us to rethink Csikszentmihalyi’s 
model. We believe that such a rethinking of the systems view of creativity can have 
significant implications for the use of digital technologies in education.
Individual, Field, and Domain: A Systems View of Creativity
To understand how new technologies are reshaping the creative landscape of the 
world, it is important to first consider a fundamental existing model for the ways in 
which creativity emerges and is situated within contexts, systems, and domains. 
Almost 20 years ago, researcher and psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1997) 
espoused his systems model of creativity to provide an understanding of how cre-
ativity operates at different levels in society.
In asserting his framework for creative production, Csikszentmihalyi noted that 
while much discussion on creativity has involved trying to understand what exactly 
creativity is, a more interesting and valuable question may involve asking “Where is 
creativity?”
4  A Systems View of Creativity in a YouTube World

Csikszentmihalyi suggested that to understand creativity in a larger context, “we 
need to abandon the Ptolemaic view of creativity, in which the person is at the center 
of everything, for a more Copernican model in which the person is part of a system 
of mutual influences and information” (1988, p. 336). His model suggests that when 
an individual or team produces something, simply asking whether it is creative or 
not misses the larger point. We must consider how creativity emerges from a 
dynamic interaction of “a system composed of three elements: a culture that con-
tains symbolic rules, a person who brings novelty into the domain, and a field of 
experts who recognize and validate the innovation” (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997, p. 6). 
The field of experts noted here act as gatekeepers who choose what is significant in 
impacting the discipline.
In essence, Csikszentmihalyi asserts that creativity lies in the interaction between 
the individual, the domain, and the field in which the creative work is couched. 
Creative work functions between these three areas and is produced and diffused 
based on the judgments and interactions of members of those levels.
At the level of the individual, individual people (or groups/teams) produce cre-
ative work, ideas, art, or new discovery. But to understand creativity at that level 
alone does not give us a full picture. Creativity also is affected at the level of the 
domain––areas of specialized knowledge (mathematics, biology, physics, art, law, 
and more). Here, the domain is the symbol system that an individual and others 
working in an area use and reference. It includes the tools, rules, conventions, 
knowledge, norms, and systems of techniques, codes, or symbols that one must 
know about in order to create or discover in the domain. This also can include what 
Csikszentmihalyi refers to as having knowledge of “fields of works” or a thorough 
understanding of the preexisting body of work in a domain, to consider how it might 
be used, built on, played with, or altered to create novel variations.
At the level of the field, we see how creative work connects to a broader audience 
or is disseminated to make impact. The field can be seen as the collective organiza-
tion of “experts,” communities of practice, or the hierarchy of people and groups 
who have been afforded the knowledge capital and clout to influence the domain at 
the cultural or social level. In essence, these are the gatekeepers (Csikszentmihalyi, 
1997). As Sawyer (2006) notes, the field involves “a complex network of experts 
with varying expertise, status, and power” (p. 124). The experts in a field make 
judgments and select which creative ideas or products are diffused more broadly 
and thus are potentially impactful on the domain or culture at large. What the field 
looks like varies by situation, context, and domain, but it might mean a Nobel Prize 
committee, journal editors or reviewers, music or movie industry executives, 
Olympic judges, and so on. These gatekeepers have traditionally determined what is 
judged worthy or what works are allowed in to make an impact on the broader area. 
Experts are identified not by how much knowledge they possess about a particular 
subject, but rather how they use that information and adapt to the problem at hand 
(Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1993).
Each of these three components—person, field, and domain—influences and is 
influenced by the others (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). Each component is a necessary

factor in creativity (and even expertise) but not sufficient in itself to produce impact-
ful or valuable novelty.
A Rethink of the Model: Who Are the Gatekeepers 
in a Changing Landscape?
Our description of gatekeepers as noted fits a traditional paradigm (Sawyer, 2006), 
but how are we to consider the model when we look at examples such as Smosh or 
other YouTube superstars such as Grace Helbig, Tyler Oakley, and Joey Graceffa? If 
these examples were anomalies, then we might overlook them or dismiss them as 
errant cases of new media being used to sidestep existing gatekeepers and catapult 
the individual(s) to success in the field. However, they are not alone; there are 
numerous examples across genres and platforms in which individuals operate under 
the assumption that, depending on the context, the old gatekeepers do not always 
determine what is deemed creative.
Let us also consider how new creative producers are transcending their platforms 
of origin. The three other YouTube stars mentioned—Helbig, Oakley, and Graceffa—
have all published books with major distributors recently, transfiguring their loyal 
online fan base into loyal offline consumers. Furthermore, YouTube has launched 
the careers of many popular musicians (e.g., Justin Bieber and Lindsey Stirling) and 
people across creative industries. For example, makeup artists such as Michelle 
Phan, Jaclyn Hill, and the Chapman sisters (under the channel name Pixiwoo) have 
built worldwide careers and received lucrative corporate contracts and international 
collaborations based on their success with multimillion subscriber channels.
YouTube is not the only place where creative producers can share their work and 
be recognized with or without the traditional gatekeepers of their fields. One inter-
esting example is that of Yori Narpati, a fan artist who often creates her own inter-
pretations of popular characters from young adult novels and other media. One of 
her well-received pieces depicted characters from Rick Riordan’s Blood of Olympus 
series and eventually caught the publisher’s attention. Disney Hyperion offered to 
buy the rights to the poster from Narpati and began selling the piece at major retail-
ers (Narpati, 2014). This case is unique in that it not only highlights how major 
companies are recognizing the value of new media creations but also shows the 
potential of remixing original material, a form of creativity sometimes looked down 
upon in traditional artistic paradigms. The popularity of Fifty Shades of Grey, essen-
tially a Twilight remix (Bertrand, 2015), points to this shifting perspective, as well. 
(At this point, we feel compelled to note that the selection of examples in this chap-
ter is not necessarily a personal endorsement of the work in question.)
Once these new creative producers find fame and acceptance of their work in 
more mainstream venues, they do not abandon the original platform but instead 
continue to focus on their connection to their fan base. While Helbig and the Smosh 
duo have created feature-length films, they both still film and upload videos to 
4  A Systems View of Creativity in a YouTube World

29
YouTube on a weekly basis, just as Michelle Phan and others continue to provide 
tutorials (though often now including their own products). Narapati still adds fan art 
to her Tumblr site, where she continues to label herself as “aspiring to be a visual 
development artist or illustrator,” even after a major deal with Disney. These artists 
understand their original sites of distribution as a place where fans still flock to 
consume their creations. These sites also still benefit the producers; recently, Forbes 
listed Phan, Lindsey Stirling, and the Smosh duo as some of YouTube’s top earners, 
all with profits in the millions (Berg, 2015). It might be argued that these producers 
have become a new type of expert.
New Gatekeepers in the Educational Landscape
Many people across industries who are considered “traditional” experts have taken 
notice of these new platforms, and this has been extending into educational territory 
with great success. One of the largest science education channels on YouTube, 
Veritasium, was created by Derek Muller, who received his PhD in physics educa-
tion. To most, Muller would be considered an expert in both physics and education 
because his dissertation, a traditional showcase for expertise, was titled Designing 
Effective Multimedia for Physics Education. However, using Bereiter and 
Scardamalia’s (1993) ideas, it is Muller’s ability to anticipate future technologies, 
communicate and educate in compelling ways, adapt lessons for a new medium, and 
distribute them to a broader audience that truly defines his expertise. In a broader 
sense, what all of these examples suggest is that systems of creative development 
and diffusion are evolving to fit the ways that technology opens up and expands 
society and culture (Bentley, 2009; Zhao, 2012).
Gatekeepers of the Past and Producers of the Future
There are some who are critical of the idea that new media suggests a rethink of 
creative systems. They note that while there is now vast potential for greater amounts 
of new content production, that doesn’t necessarily mean that most of that work will 
be good, or creative, or that the majority will find great success or expertise. There 
are billions of videos on YouTube, with new ones being uploaded every second 
(YouTube Press Statistics, n.d.), and new artwork, new eBooks, blogs, and other 
forms of self-publishing shared via the digital world. Yet the majority of them may 
never find a significant audience or put a dent in their genre or culture. At some 
level, that does not change the fact that there has been a dramatic shift in the land-
scape or that the barriers to creative production and paths to an audience have been 
altered by digital tools.
It is true that much of the work produced on YouTube, Tumblr, or other media 
may not be considered high quality by the standards of the genre or may not find a

big audience, but that is also a norm for almost any field of creative production. We 
might look to the concept of Sturgeon’s law set forth by Theodore Sturgeon, an 
American author of science fiction, who defended the sci-fi genre against critics 
who derided it as a low-quality medium. He noted that the overwhelming majority 
of work in almost any field could be viewed as low quality, and in this way science 
fiction was no different from other art forms. As Sturgeon put it, “Using the same 
standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be 
argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc … is crap. In other words, 
the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, 
because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other art forms” 
(Sturgeon, 1957, p. 78). This idea becomes prevalent in the arena of new media 
where the preexisting barriers (e.g., the whims of “experts” like publishers, movie 
and television executives, and so on) disappear. The ability to explore, create, and 
share content simply makes the “lesser” 90% more publicly visible, perhaps leading 
to the inaccurate idea that such media attracts worse content. In truth, there is sim-
ply more opportunity to create and more work out there to be shared.
While the systems model of creativity still has credence in many ways, it requires 
reconsideration to account for these new avenues of creative production and new 
means of interaction between the individual, the field, and the domain. New tech-
nology is a core reason for this. The ability to create has become easier, putting the 
tools for the creation of new things in more hands more readily (Mishra & Koehler, 
2006). The resources it brings with it, including infrastructures for connecting 
around the world, have made the sharing much easier. For much of the history of 
human creativity, the work of creating and diffusing new innovations was being 
done by the field (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988, 1997), and even in the recent past, the 
field was acting as the gatekeeper, deciding who was and was not an expert.
Digital technologies and connectivity, however, allow individuals to sidestep 
these traditional gatekeepers and communicate directly with a broader audience, 
creating a new nexus of expertise and consumption. In this sense, new media can 
often cut out the “middleman” role by connecting artists with an audience. This can 
remove traditional gatekeeper roles in some contexts or situations (e.g., artists can 
display work online instead of going through a gallery owner where a natural restric-
tion often happens). In that case, it might even be argued that new media sharing can 
strengthen quality in a particular medium because the audience can discern quality 
or worth without having a moderator restrict the relationship with the creator or the 
diffusion of the work. The phenomenon of increased access to the field occurs not 
just in terms of creator to the gatekeeper to the audience, but it also happens in terms 
of how the audience can connect with the creator—sometimes in an immediate 
feedback loop. As such, the role of the “influencer” and the consumer both garner 
more power or more say in the process.
Even once new experts are identified in new media, they rarely become gate-
keepers in the traditional sense with direct power to designate disciplines or power 
over distribution channels simply because the affordances of the technologies do 
not necessarily assign them this role. While those who have been labeled as experts 
can certainly encourage and influence consumers to seek out particular individuals, 
4  A Systems View of Creativity in a YouTube World

31
they cannot stop any new producer from sharing content. In this sense, the field is 
actually very open, and such a role does not have the same veto or limiting controls 
as the traditional award committees or art judges might have. Perhaps this requires 
a shift in terminology away from gatekeeper and toward influencer. The term has 
already gained traction in the marketing industry (Wong, 2014), and we consider 
that it might fit well to depict the role that these new experts of new media assume.
Conclusion: Rethinking Creativity with New Media
We suggest a possible rethinking of aspects of Csikszentmihalyi’s systems model—
not to replace or overturn it, but to update it for new technology and shifts in certain 
contexts and genres. At the level of the individual, if we think of people as either 
consumers or producers of content, there are now more producers than ever. When 
YouTube first started, there were significantly more consumers than producers 
(YouTube Press Statistics, n.d.). While the balance still reflects that more people 
consume than produce, there has been a shift toward an ever-increasing number of 
producers. More importantly, the flood of new media has allowed for a different 
path of entry to finding an audience or achieving creative success. New tools make 
it much more feasible for anyone with access to create and share their work with the 
world. These tools and digital infrastructures have also allowed the work to be 
shared with potentially worldwide audiences.
The examples that we have noted here showcase a few instances, representative 
of many others that exist across genres. Consider again Derek Muller’s Veritasium 
channel. As a producer, he has taken knowledge of the content, with knowledge 
about how to educate for that content, and shared it in a new technology medium. 
More and more such educational channels are popping up, such as Minute Physics 
and ASAP Science (even established organizations like NASA have taken up the 
venue with popular channels). The popularity, as evidenced by subscribers and 
video views, suggests that content creation can intersect with teaching and learning 
in compelling ways.
History reveals that technology usually increases exponentially, altering the 
ways we communicate, teach, and learn. Since we suggest it also revises aspects of 
the creative systems in which new work emerges and is diffused, there are possible 
implications and new questions for education. What those questions are is not nec-
essarily fully known or articulated yet, but we propose that this is a vital and open 
set of emergent issues that demands consideration and discourse. If we rethink or 
amend a systems perspective on creativity, then we must also consider how these 
ideas will affect the classroom. For example, how can the power of new tools for 
creation be harnessed to promote a creative and expansive mindset in students? 
What does the systems model of creativity look like in the classroom, and does it 
affect the teacher’s role as a gatekeeper student work? Rethinking the systems per-
spective on creativity also requires us to consider aspects of our current models of 
education and how well these are suited to the ever-changing times we live in.
Conclusion: Rethinking Creativity with New Media

32
At a broader level, all of this may suggest that students and teachers alike can 
find ways to bypass the traditional “gates” and use technology in new and creative 
ways. We end this piece with more questions than answers—as is appropriate in any 
new wave of thinking, and especially in this emergent and vital area of creativity 
and education.

On Being (In)Disciplined
Dostoyevsky gave me more than any thinker, more than Gauss.
~ Albert Einstein
School systems should base their curriculum not on the idea of separate subjects, but on the 
much more fertile idea of disciplines. . . which makes possible a fluid and dynamic curricu-
lum that is interdisciplinary.
~ Ken Robinson
Introduction
Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) was one of the greatest scientists of his time. His 
work on statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases helps explain and pre-
dict how the properties of atoms (such as charge and mass) determine the physical 
properties of gases (such as viscosity, diffusion, and temperature). Ludwig 
Boltzmann was also an accomplished musician. Boltzmann, however, did not see 
these two interests (science and music) as being independent of each other. In con-
trast, he often described a synchronicity between mathematics and music, seeing 
both as being involved in the creative act of identifying and manipulating underly-
ing rhythms and patterns to create new ones. Moreover, Boltzmann perceived this 
process as being deeply personal, in how an individual’s creative voice was deeply 
connected to the final product. This, of course, is in sharp contrast to the view of 
science as being a coolly dispassionate methodology, disconnected from the

personality of the scientist. Boltzmann’s viewpoint can be seen in how he described 
the experience of reading physicist James Clerk Maxwell’s work on the dynamical 
theory of gases. Note the manner in which Boltzmann connects his reading of math-
ematics to the experience of hearing a musical composition:
The variations of the velocities are, at first, developed majestically: then from one side enter 
the equations of state: and from the other side, the equations of motion in a central field. 
Ever higher soars the chaos of formulae. Suddenly we hear, as from kettle drums, the four 
beats “Put N = 5.” The evil spirit V (relative velocity of molecules) vanishes: and, even as 
in music a hitherto dominating figure in the bass is suddenly silenced, that which had 
seemed insuperable has been overcome as if by a stroke of magic . . . One result after 
another follows in quick succession till at last, as the unexpected climax, we arrive at the 
conditions for thermal equilibrium together with the expressions for the transport coeffi-
cients. The curtain then falls! (Boltzmann quoted in Root-Bernstein, 1989, p. 334)
Boltzmann’s experience of Maxwell’s mathematics has a breathtaking, compulsive, 
dramatic quality to it with a clear feeling of musical affect in his descriptions of the 
equations and formulae. This is not merely analogy, but rather was an explanation 
of what Boltzmann experienced in the connection between music and mathematical 
physics. And he is not alone; great thinkers in the areas of math and science often 
relate their efforts to music or the arts, highlighting the aural and visual experiences 
of their work much more than the logical or formulaic.
William Lipscomb, a Nobel Prize laureate in Chemistry, wrote about the artistic 
and aesthetic aspects of scientific idea generation which he described as “a focusing 
of intellect and emotions which was surely an aesthetic response” (all quotes from 
Lipscomb from Root-Bernstein & Root-Bernstein, 1999, p. 4). Going on to describe 
his experience, he wrote that though the process of testing the ideas followed the 
stringent rules of science, the initial process of coming up with predictions and 
alternatives had an artistic flavor. As he wrote, “Was it science? Our later tests 
showed it was. But the process that I used and the responses I felt were more like 
those of an artist.” It is not that the analytic and the logical are not important, but 
rather that they don’t tell the whole story.
These examples are significant not just because they represent insights on cre-
ative thinking from certain great thinkers but because they represent a pattern of 
insights from most all great thinkers (Root-Bernstein, 2003). Most creative people 
do not view their work as confined to their discipline but rather are inspired and 
elevated by connections within and between other disciplines (Lehrer, 2012). From 
science to art, from music to mathematics or literature, people who work creatively 
within their own discipline do so in ways that cut across disciplines (Catterall, 2002).
We argue that examples such as this (and many others like it) have significant 
implications for how we approach teaching and learning. If we ignore these 
boundary-­breaking ways of thinking—these personal, aesthetic connections to 
knowledge—we deny our students approaches that have worked for great thinkers 
and prevent them from experiencing the true richness of thinking and learning 
(Pink, 2005).
These unbounded ways of thinking stand in contrast to how our education sys-
tem is structured today. Robinson (2003) noted that schools are structured to 
5  On Being (In)Disciplined

37
­maintain rigid disciplinary boundaries, and subject matter is confined to distinct 
classes and allotted time periods. This is not how critical and creative thinking skills 
develop, and it’s not how truly extraordinary thinkers operate (Root-Bernstein, 
2003). This mismatch between what we need and what we are doing is a problem 
because we can never achieve desired outcomes (flexible, creative thinkers and 
learners) without using appropriate means (a flexible, creative framework in teach-
ing and curriculum).
Within and Without Discipline
There is an increased interest in the teaching of creativity in schools today (Florida, 
2002; Williams, 2002). It’s generally agreed that creative thinkers and learners are 
needed in our society and into the future (Freedman, 2007; Partnership for 21st 
Century Skills, 2004). Yet most discussions of creativity tend to focus on generic, 
content-free skills and techniques (Freedman, 2003). This is problematic, since it is 
clear from historical and biographical studies that innovative scientists are deeply 
enmeshed in their fields of study even while being open to other disciplinary ways 
of working and thinking (Root-Bernstein, 2003). Though we agree with these calls 
for a greater emphasis on creativity, we are critical of how these approaches are 
being conceptualized and implemented.
Creativity requires deep knowledge of the discipline that creative work emerges 
within as well as spanning the disciplines. (Chaps. 8, 9, and 10 explore this idea 
through specific case studies of highly creative individuals in engineering, compu-
tational thinking, and mathematics.) Certain creative thinking skills (such as obser-
vation or pattern recognition and creation) are as common to creative scientists and 
mathematicians as they are to artists or musicians (Caper, 1996; Hudson, 1967). 
Such skills reveal continuity in creative work across varied domains, yet creativity 
is clearly not the same across disciplines. The products and processes of creative 
work vary quite a bit between areas like physics and musical composition or biology 
and painting (Eisner, 1998; Starko, 2005). So we’re left with a contradiction, in 
which creativity both requires deep disciplinary knowledge and also the ability to 
break disciplinary boundaries and transfer ideas across other subject matters.
It is to confront this apparent paradox that we introduce the notion of indisci-
plined learning, i.e., creativity happens in a discipline or context; while understand-
ing that at the same time, it is “indisciplined” (cutting across disciplinary limits to 
emphasize divergent thinking and imagination). This view of creativity is analogous 
to how physicists describe light as having a dual nature, being both a wave and a 
particle, behaving like either or both at different times and different contexts (Smoot, 
1994). We suggest that creativity has a similar dual nature in that it is both deeply 
embedded within each discipline and at the same time cuts across disciplinary 
boundaries.
Within and Without Discipline

38
A Transdisciplinary Approach: Creative-Cognitive Skills
While the notion of indisciplined thinking expresses the way that creativity works, 
we are left with the question of how to approach this as a mindset. How do we stay 
within a discipline and still cut across the disciplines? To manage this paradox, we 
need a framework for creative thinking that is broad enough to be used across vary-
ing disciplines, yet flexible enough to work within each discipline. Transdisciplinary 
thinking offers just such a set of meta-level thinking skills which respect the impor-
tance of disciplinary knowledge while allowing for novel connections between dis-
ciplines (Henriksen, 2011; Mishra, Koehler, & Henriksen, 2011; Root-Bernstein, 
1996, 2003; Root-Bernstein & Root-Bernstein, 1999). This is an open yet guiding 
structure that involves a range of specific cognitive skills including perceiving, pat-
terning, abstracting, embodied thinking, modeling, play, and synthesis. These skills 
allow people to transfer information creatively from one domain to another, solving 
problems or developing unique insights by seeing things in a new way. This is par-
ticularly relevant in the context of educational technology because technology also 
allows people to develop these skills in powerful and creative ways.
Echoes of transdisciplinary thinking are already resonating in areas of STEM 
(science, technology, engineering, and math) education. Increasingly, educators and 
researchers have begun to note the need for an infusion of creativity in traditional 
“analytic” curriculum like STEM disciplines (White, 2010). One response has been 
to suggest an artistic component within the traditional STEM curriculum. There has 
recently been much discussion of “STEAM” (science, technology, engineering, 
arts, and mathematics) as a new paradigm.
This STEAM paradigm is an interesting and potentially useful approach as it 
begins to chip away at rigid notions of science and mathematics and considers the 
value of traveling between disciplines. But transdisciplinary thinking can take us 
even farther with a complete, flexible, and useful structure of skills for thinking in 
any discipline. The new ways of experiencing and creating that it provides for are 
potentially even more powerful in the context of technology and all that technology 
allows for and opens up to us.
The Three Ts (Technology, Transdisciplinary Thinking, 
and Teaching)
In other publications, we have described examples of how transdisciplinary think-
ing can allow teaching with technology to happen in interesting and compelling 
ways (Mishra et al., 2011; see also Chaps. 1, 4, and 12 in this book). In this chapter, 
we provide an example of how the transdisciplinary skill of “perceiving” (or finely 
tuned observation) can be used in a master’s level course focusing on design and 
technology. We contextualize this by considering the parallel ideas of déjà vu and 
véjà du. If déjà vu is the process by which something strange becomes abruptly and 
5  On Being (In)Disciplined

39
surprisingly familiar, then véjà du is the very opposite. It is the seeing of a familiar 
situation with “fresh eyes,” as if you have never seen it before. So, if déjà vu is about 
making the strange look familiar, véjà du is all about making the familiar look 
strange! We argue that all learning is about either déjà vu or véjà du. In the sciences, 
for example, the “strange” idea that time actually slows down when something 
approaches the speed of light emerges through the application of straightforward 
equations because the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit (déjà vu). A flip side 
example might be the idea that something as “familiar” as a rainbow is also the 
strange interplay of waves of light with droplets of rain (véjà du).
In our courses, students learn to “see” their world differently by using digital 
cameras to create videos that reveal something—an object, an idea, an incident, 
etc.—in a dramatically new light. The goal is to familiarize the strange or reveal the 
weird qualities of the familiar. For example, by taking a digital picture of an object at 
extended intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, depending on the rate of change in the 
depicted object) and editing these images together using design software, the object 
or scene can be brought to life in unexpected ways. Conversely, slowing a scene down 
can bring out qualities that are usually outside of our awareness (the slow-motion 
view of a raindrop hitting the surface of a glass of puddle of water is an example). 
Other ways to go about this assignment are capturing the organic features of nonliv-
ing things or drawing out stable patterns from moving scenes (as when a busy traffic 
intersection at night turns into a stream of bright lines when shown in quick motion).
The kinds of cameras or software that students use vary a bit, and the kinds of 
videos created or approaches to the assignment vary a lot. But at the heart of this is 
the notion that it’s important to be able to see things in a completely new and differ-
ent way. The transdisciplinary skill of “perceiving” (just one in the range of trans-
disciplinary skills) is highlighted here because this skill focuses on observation or 
attention to incredibly fine detail. In order to see something, really see it in a revo-
lutionary way, one has to observe it more painstakingly than any casual observer 
ever would. Most renowned scientists and artists have commented on the ways that 
their abilities and creative insights transformed when they made the jump from 
“looking” to “seeing” (Root-Bernstein & Root-Bernstein, 1999). Csikszentmihalyi 
(1990) calls this the perception-recognition distinction. So it is important that stu-
dents get these opportunities too, at all grade levels and subject matters, and tech-
nology, with all its unique affordances, give us new ways of doing this. For instance, 
in our example, students learn the design/technology content of the lesson in a way 
that also engages their “perceiving” skills. Innovative scientists and talented artists 
alike require this thinking ability, and weaving it into the content of a technology-­
rich lesson is a way to engage deep and multimodal learning experiences.
Conclusion
In recent years, creativity has become a trait of intense interest in fields such as 
education and psychology (Plucker, Beghetto, & Dow, 2004). Although our educa-
tional policy has veered toward rigid, standardized approaches, there remains a 
Conclusion

40
broad consensus that creativity is essential, and we need to find ways to infuse it into 
classrooms and students’ thought processes (Freedman, 2003; Williams, 2002). But 
even with this recognition of need, most researchers, psychologists, educators, and 
policy makers still talk about creativity in very generic and fuzzy terms. Researchers 
have suggested that this problem of vagueness is due to the abstract and complex 
nature of creativity and the fact that there is not one consistent definition of “what 
creativity is” in teaching or educational research (Baker, Rudd, & Pomeroy, 2001; 
Friedel & Rudd, 2005; Sternberg, 1999). We would argue that the problem has also 
been due to the lack of a workable framework—thinking skills that are broad enough 
to cover a range of disciplines and flexible enough to be used differently in different 
disciplines—such as transdisciplinary thinking.
We need to break away from the current approaches to incorporating creativity in 
the classroom (which are often too generic and do not take the notion of content or 
disciplines into account). Education today requires a more action-oriented view 
where we consider creativity and thinking in ways that great creative minds actually 
do. Our notion of being indisciplined suggests that it is important to work within a 
discipline and also be able to learn and gather ideas by crossing over into others.
We began with a quote from Einstein where he noted how Dostoyevsky had influ-
enced his thinking than Gauss. Consider that fact—a great literary figure had more 
influence on Einstein’s work and thinking than a great mathematician did (Schlain, 
1993). It is this form of transdisciplinary thinking that we need to provide to our 
students. To do that we need a framework of skills, one that can be used for lessons 
and learning experiences that are rich in creativity and technology. That is where 
being “indisciplined”, and using “transdisciplinary” thinking, comes out to play.

Twisting Knobs and Connecting Things
Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating.

Creativity is just connecting things.

Knobs, knobs everywhere, just vary a knob to think.
~ Douglas R. Hofstadter
Introduction
One of the challenges of understanding creativity is to understand its inception: 
where do creative ideas come from? This is an important question, given the resur-
gence of interest in creativity (Eagleman, 2011; Kandel, 2012; Simonton, 2004). In 
this chapter, we consider issues such as where does creativity come from and how 
do creative ideas emerge? In brief, we argue that creativity is not a magical process, 
but rather creative ideas emerge from combining pre-existing ideas and concepts in 
unique and new ways. Though this may appear to be a simplistic formulation, we 
suggest that it is far from that. Creating these novel, effective, and whole combina-
tions is unpredictable and requires people to bring together a wide range of back-
ground knowledge and experience. It is this breadth of knowledge and experience 
that allows creative individuals to see novel connections and act on them.

The Myth of the Creative “Spark”
Creativity has often been thought of as an elusive and mystical force, emerging from 
bursts of insight available only to certain fortunate individuals. During Greco-­
Roman times, creativity was considered a divine trait over which humans had little 
or no control. Creative ability was merely mythic inspiration (or even madness) 
imparted by the gods. Plato, for instance, wrote of the muse as being a kind of fickle 
spirit, whimsically bestowing insights or the gift of creativity to particular individu-
als (Starko, 2005).
Sternberg and Lubart (1991) noted that despite significant progress in the scien-
tific study of creativity, many people still continue to view creativity as being magi-
cal in nature—a process that cannot be studied or understood analytically. While the 
persistence of this myth may be dubious to those of us interested in the empirical 
study of creativity, examples of this view still abound. For instance, consider 
Elizabeth Gilbert’s (2009) TED talk where she asserted the value such ancient 
Greco-Roman views in which creativity didn’t come from human beings but instead 
came to human beings (Starko, 2005). Although she suggested this view, for the 
most part, as a “protective psychological construct,” it does demonstrate the persis-
tence of the popular myth about creativity as being beyond human control.
By Renaissance times, the general understanding of creativity had evolved some-
what. Creative individuals were no longer seen as objects of luck, fate, or mystical 
forces but rather as special or singular people with unique ways of seeing (Kneller, 
1965). Creative people were now understood to have certain inherent, intuitive abili-
ties to see and understand what others could not. It was at this time that the word 
genius began to be used for extraordinary individuals such as Newton or Leonardo 
da Vinci (Starko, 2005).
The fundamental problem with these views was that they either emphasized cre-
ativity as something mysterious and inherent in creative individuals or they viewed 
it as being bestowed by some mystical force—in either case conceiving it as some-
thing beyond the normal and thus not amenable to analysis.
In contrast, contemporary views argue for a more prosaic perspective toward the 
creative process, suggesting that creativity, though it may feel mysterious, is not 
magic and is not out of the reach of our understanding. Creativity is a way of operat-
ing, not merely a given trait. In this view, creativity is the end result of the manner 
in which human cognition works and is available to all people. Finally, as with other 
human cognitive skills, there is a significant level of variability between individuals, 
and creativity can be learned and developed with practice.
The key idea here is that all creativity builds upon things and ideas that already 
exist, i.e., every creative idea is essentially a derivative work. This idea of “combi-
natorial creativity” (Ferguson, 2011) suggests that new ideas emerge from permuta-
tions, combinations, and tweaking of existing ideas. Creativity is pastiche—the 
result of combining old ideas, or fragments of ideas, tweaking, and otherwise modi-
fying them to bring something new into the world.
6  Twisting Knobs and Connecting Things

45
At some level, this notion is not new, and many artists and creative individuals 
throughout history have remarked on it. For instance, in his Sonnet 59, Shakespeare 
doubted the possibility of absolute originality in creative work, writing:
If there be nothing new, but that which is
Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss
The second burden of a former child
(trans. 2003)
Mark Twain echoed a similar idea when he suggested that “substantially all ideas 
are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside 
sources. When a great orator makes a great speech you are listening to ten centuries 
and ten thousand men—but we call it his speech, and really some exceedingly small 
portion of it is his.” (quoted in Popova, 2012a)
So, if (as Shakespeare or Mark Twain suggest) creativity is simply the act of 
drawing from existing sources, or as Steve Jobs said, nothing but “connecting 
things,” it still begs the question of how this kind of appropriation, modification, and 
recombination of existing ideas take place. And furthermore, why are some people 
better at it than others?
Variations on a Theme
One way of thinking about how these combinations or recombinations occur is pro-
posed by cognitive scientist and polymath Douglas Hofstadter. Hofstadter (1985) 
suggested that every concept in our mind comes with a range of other hooks or 
concepts associated with it. In essence, one might consider any particular concept to 
be a device with “knobs” (knobs that reflect different changeable aspects or proper-
ties of the object). A creative person then works with those knobs to figure out pos-
sible variations on the original concept and to incorporate anything that will produce 
something novel, effective and/or aesthetically pleasing. In other words, creativity 
involves “twisting the knobs” on an existing idea or artifact to create new variations 
on an existing theme.
For instance, the idea of the Rubik’s Cube would come associated with the ideas 
(or knobs) of geometric shapes, colors, twisting, puzzles, and so on. It is these 
knobs, or variables, that we can change or manipulate to come with a variation on 
the Rubik’s Cube. In a standard Rubik’s Cube, one of the knobs is that of dimen-
sionality. In the original instantiation of the idea, it happens to be set to three (as the 
standard cube is 3 × 3 × 3), but this does not have to be so. Other new and interesting 
variations on the Rubik’s Cube have incorporated different levels of dimensionality 
(2 × 2 × 2, or 4 × 4 × 4, or, even more interestingly, 2 × 3 × 3, and other variations) 
in order to offer more or less complexity in the art of solving the puzzle. Clearly 
these are nothing but variations on the theme.
Variations on a Theme

46
Creativity, then, is the process of making alterations to, and new combinations 
with, pre-existing ideas and artifacts to create something new. It is essentially a way 
of putting a new spin or twist on that which came before. Of course, there is a great 
variation in the kinds of knobs that people see. Merely twisting the knobs may get 
you something different than what existed before, but that is no guarantee that what 
it produces will be creative. It may merely be different, and anybody can do some-
thing different. The key to creativity is to make something with value and style, 
something novel, effective, and whole, NEW as it were (as described in greater 
detail in Chap. 3). This requires seeing knobs that are not obvious at first glance to 
the uninitiated or untrained.
For instance, a superficial variation on the Rubik’s Cube would be twisting the 
knob labeled “color” and thus changing the colors of the six faces—replacing them 
with other colors, photographs, or other images. This is a different solution, but one 
would loathe to describe it as being creative in the true sense of the word. A deeper 
variation could involve seeing the cube as being an example of a Platonic solid. 
Once this knob is identified, it automatically leads to a range of different twisty 
puzzles based on other Platonic solids—octahedrons, dodecahedrons, icosahedrons, 
and so on. (See twistypuzzles.com to see just how many variations of the Rubik’s 
Cube have been developed—all created by identifying different knobs and varying 
their settings.)
The crucial idea here, of course, is seeing the right knobs. Once these are identi-
fied, creating variations is relatively straightforward. Hofstadter (1985) half face-
tiously writes that creativity is easy, or, as he paraphrased it, “Knobs, knobs 
everywhere, just vary a knob to think!” (p. 251). But the critical factor, or “the crux 
of creativity is not just in twisting knobs, but in spotting them” (p. 251). Clearly, 
they “are not displayed in a nice, neat little control panel, forevermore unchange-
able” (p. 251). And most importantly the ability to spot the right knobs on concepts 
can vary from individual to individual and from context to context.
On Knowing (A Lot of Different Things)
A crucial factor influencing how a concept is understood (and thus how it can be 
changed or reconfigured) is background knowledge. People with a wider range of 
knowledge and experience have richer concepts to build on and hence the potential 
to see more knobs or possibilities than those with narrower foundations. Again, 
consider the example of the Rubik’s Cube above. Only someone with knowledge of 
solid geometry would see the cube as being an example of many different Platonic 
solids. Hence, this particular knob and its possible variations are only available 
given the appropriate knowledge or experience. The same goes for any concepts or 
artifacts and their potential connections across disciplines. Additionally, Hofstadter 
(1985) argued that changing the context can “bring new knobs into play” since it 
can let you see the concept anew “from various angles” where “more and more of 
its knobs are revealed” (p. 239).
6  Twisting Knobs and Connecting Things

47
Simply put, creativity is accessible to those who have a wide range of knowledge 
and experiences, and they use them to guide their observations and ability to see 
“one thing as something else” (Hofstadter, 1985, p. 239). This, we suggest, is where 
both “combinatorial creativity” and a wide array of knowledge and experiences 
(what we have called transdisciplinary knowledge or thinking as described in Chap. 
5 or in Henriksen and The Deep-Play Research Group (2017)) becomes essential to 
creativity. Transdisciplinary knowledge provides individuals with the mental 
resources to spot new knobs and see the possibilities for twisting them (or making 
new connections) that would not be accessible to those without such boundary-­
breaking knowledge. The trick in developing creative thinkers is to provide people 
with a rich range of ways of understanding and experiencing the world, thus enrich-
ing the concepts they have. This is where the bringing together of art and design or 
science and poetry provides multiple hooks and endless new combinations to fuse 
together in acts of creativity.
Thus, we argue that combinatorial creativity requires having diverse mental 
resources to build on. These resources may include personal knowledge bases, 
interests, and experiences which allow creative people to manipulate existing works 
and knowledge to create something new.
It is also important to note that individuals significantly differ from each other in 
their knowledge and experience. This has two implications. First, given this diver-
sity, the connections people make will be idiosyncratic to the individual, i.e., people 
will vary greatly in the kinds of connections they make. Second, given its idiosyn-
cratic nature, it is clear that combinatorial thinking cannot be forced or predicted, it 
must develop organically, determined and constrained by the unique resources that 
the individual brings to the creative process.
Creative thinkers tend to create this optimized cerebral climate for creativity in 
very natural ways—by enriching their mental cache of reserves and by means of 
diverse and eclectic interests, knowledge, and life experiences. In developing inter-
ests and skills across disciplines, creative thinkers have a deeper pool of inspiration 
to dip into. Their existing knowledge and experiences can then fuse together and 
allow them to envisage new combinations and permutations of ideas.
Let History Be the Guide
The history of science and technology show us many examples of such ways of 
thinking. For instance, Charles Darwin is an excellent example of a prepared mind 
whose creative genius was sparked by something he was reading for pleasure.
It was Darwin’s rich observational experience of traveling across the world on 
the HMS Beagle that mentally primed him for coming up with the theory of evolu-
tion. However, a key idea (the idea that species evolved through a process of random 
variation and natural selection as they compete for limited resources) came to him 
while he was engaged in some reading for enjoyment (specifically his reading of 
Let History Be the Guide

48
Malthus’ Essay on the Principle of Population). This is best described by Darwin 
himself, in his autobiography:
In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic inquiry, I happened 
to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the 
struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the 
habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable 
[sic] variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable [sic] ones to be destroyed. 
The results of this would be the formation of a new species. Here, then I had at last got a 
theory by which to work. (Darwin, 1887, p. 68)
Another compelling example comes from the story of the discovery of penicillin 
by Alexander Fleming. Fleming, in addition to being a top-notch scientist, was also 
a lover of art and was himself a pretty good painter. As a member of the Chelsea 
Arts Club, he created his own watercolor paintings, but, more importantly, he also 
enjoyed the unconventional experience of painting with living organisms. He cre-
ated fascinating “paintings” using only bacteria and the colors they developed. He 
painstakingly placed microbes with diverse organic pigments at different locations 
on a petri dish—which, in time, developed into intricate pieces of art—including 
diverse scenes such as ballerinas, soldiers, mothers and children, and much more 
(Dunn, 2010). Such paintings were technically challenging because Fleming had to 
first locate microbes with specific pigments and then figure out how to inoculate 
them so that the different species matured at appropriate times to reveal the right 
colors.
It was a strange anomaly in one of these paintings, an uncharacteristic color and 
growth, which came to his attention and ultimately led to the discovery of penicillin. 
What made this discovery possible was not merely his scientific knowledge (though 
that was certainly important) but also the unique combination of science and art in 
his life and mind. Other scientists had certainly seen penicillin developing in their 
petri dishes before Fleming but had not noted anything significant and had tossed 
them out as failures. But Fleming saw what he did because he had developed an 
“eye for the rare, an artist’s eye” (Dunn, 2010).
Charles Darwin and Alexander Fleming are by no means unique in following a 
path toward successful creativity through the merging of varied knowledge and 
experiences. Many other historical accounts by creative minds in any field follow a 
similar combinatorial path in which great works or ideas arise when inspiration is 
created through ideas fusing from different disciplines and experiences (Root-­
Bernstein, 2003; Root-Bernstein & Root-Bernstein, 1999; Simonton, 2004).
These unique combinations and blending of varied knowledge, experiences, and 
interests are—as history shows us again and again—excellent catalysts for success-
ful creativity. No creative work occurs in a vacuum nor does it take place locked 
within tight disciplinary boundaries. Rather, it occurs through accumulated knowl-
edge and varied inspirations, and one of the best ways to promote such thinking is 
to prepare the mind for it.
6  Twisting Knobs and Connecting Things

Preparing the Mind for Creativity
The creative process has never been, and will never be, an easy or straightforward 
one. Just filling one’s mind or life with knowledge and varied experiences is not 
necessarily sufficient to engender creative ideas, though it may be necessary. 
“Chance,” as Pasteur famously said, “favors the prepared mind.” Thinking and 
learning across and between disciplines is a means to optimize the mind for the 
cross-pollination of knowledge that ultimately leads to creative ideas.
Popova (2012b) notes how great creative thinkers have often asserted the impor-
tance of a “rich personal micro-culture” that allows them to build new combina-
tions. This microculture becomes a way of being in the world. Thus, creative thought 
is not talent that is unique to certain individuals or something given to us from the 
gods. It is, as John Cleese said, not a talent but rather a way of operating. By culti-
vating a matrix of knowledge that draws from different disciplines, and opportunis-
tically or strategically pulling from these diverse ideas, we strengthen our ability to 
think divergently and to make novel connections.
The deeply individual nature of the process suggests that creativity does not fol-
low a straight and narrow path and that it cannot be predicted. But creativity can be 
nurtured (Chaps. 8 and 12 in this book explore this idea in greater detail). It can be 
nurtured by offering learners rich experiences with art and science and with open-­
ended experiences that encourage the making of deeply personal connections across 
knowledge domains. A complex web of possibilities, paths, and unfolding connec-
tions is needed to offer productive grounds for creative work. The varied mental 
resources that are developed in a transdisciplinary way of thinking are a catalyzing 
agent for creativity because they provide opportunities for people to “see” different 
ideas and possible inspirations and bring them together in unique combinations.
Conclusion
We began this chapter with a quote from Steve Jobs’ interview in Wired magazine 
(Wolf, 1995), where he said that, “creativity is just connecting things.” That said, it 
is clear that these connections have to be made by a prepared mind, a mind prepared 
to see the right knobs (a la Hofstadter). Steve Jobs clearly understood this. Note his 
eloquent Stanford commencement address where he spoke of his diverse back-
ground and varied interests and how they prepared him for success at Apple (Chap. 
3 in this book). He struck a similar note in the Wired magazine interview. After say-
ing “Creativity is just connecting things,” he went on to say:
When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they 
didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's 
because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. And 
the reason they were able to do that was that they've had more experiences or they have 
thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that's too rare a 
commodity. (italics added)
Conclusion

50
This emphasis on prior experiences reveals how we see the knobs, possibilities, 
and options in any creative idea. As Hofstadter (1985) said, once we learn to see the 
world in this manner, creativity is as “easy as falling off a log” (p. 251). And it is this 
“learning to see” that is of most importance to us, as educators, as we continue to 
emphasize the value of creativity and seek to nurture it in our students. It is here that 
the new tools we have today, tools that offer new forms of representation, interac-
tion, and visualization become so very important. Speaking of the computer indus-
try, but unfortunately very applicable to education today, Steve Jobs went on to say:
A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have 
enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspec-
tive on the problem.
Our task as educators is to provide learners with these diverse experiences to 
help them develop these broader perspectives that Steve Jobs speaks of. The future 
demands nothing less.

Introduction
Creative people, be they artists or authors, scientists or musicians, are often asked 
where their ideas come from. Stephen King, in his book “On Writing,” replied that 
his ideas came from “a small bloodthirsty elf who lives in a hole under my desk.” 
His son, Joe Hill, an accomplished author in his own right, offers a similar tongue-­
in-­cheek response suggesting that his ideas come from “Schenectady,” specifically 
from a Mom and Pop store on Route 147! As an aside, more of these stories of 
inspiration are found at http://wheredoyougetyourideas.wordpress.com/.
As we have argued in this book, and specifically in the previous chapter, creativity 
is not a “magical” process; rather it emerges from combining pre-existing ideas and 
concepts in unique and novel ways. Creativity builds on that which already exists, 
This chapter is edited and derived from the following article, which originally appeared in the 
journal TechTrends (with permission from the publisher and editor). With thanks and credit to the

i.e., every creative idea is, in some way, derivative of what has come before; it has a 
“combinatorial” nature (Ferguson, 2011; Popova, 2012) emerging from permuta-
tions, combinations, and alterations to existing ideas or artifacts.
This view of creativity as emerging from existing work faces an important chal-
lenge. If creativity is simply variations on a theme, then how do we explain the 
striking originality of a Bach Sonata, or Einstein’s theory of relativity, or a Picasso 
painting? Were these individuals merely “appropriating” ideas and themes from 
others? How do we explain creative work that seems uniquely novel, in which we 
cannot see any traces of the influence it was derived from?
It is one thing to discuss these ideas and another to ground them in actual cases 
of creative practice. This chapter explores the idea of creativity as “variations on a 
theme” further. Here, we ground it by digging deeper into some specific examples 
taken from the world of puzzle and game design that were described, somewhat 
superficially, in the previous chapter.
Double Maze
Let us begin by describing a computer puzzle game called Double Maze. Double 
Maze was designed by Scott Kim, a noted graphic artist, author, dancer, puzzler, and 
game designer. Imagine a simple maze game, in which you must navigate a ball (or 
any other object) through a maze keeping it away from some pitfalls, such as holes, 
to a predetermined location (Fig. 7.1). Now imagine two different mazes that work 
in tandem with each other. A move in one maze is paralleled by a move on the other. 
So, if you shift the ball left in one maze, it shifts to the left in the other maze as well. 
The goal now is to get both the balls to the final predetermined spot simultaneously. 
Fig. 7.1  The Double Maze puzzle game designed by Scott Kim

55
In the version shown below, you have to maneuver two pieces (the balls at the cor-
ners to the star at the opposite end of the board) without falling into the holes (the 
four squares at the center) or off the board. You can take advantage of the strategi-
cally placed walls (indicated by the striped lines) to change the relative location of 
the balls from each other.
Double Maze can be fiendishly difficult to navigate as you have to control not 
just one object but two (and the relative positions of both) in order to get them both 
onto the star at the same time! As puzzles go, this is a new style of puzzle, and we 
would rank it high along the three dimensions of creativity as being novel, effective, 
and whole (see Chap. 3 in this book). How did Scott Kim come up with a game as 
original, unique, and creative as this one? We’ll return to this question with other 
examples of creativity in puzzles and games as we consider the idea of creativity as 
variations on a theme.
Variance in Variations
The variations on a theme concept compares the creative process to “twisting 
knobs,” where “knobs” are the variables on an object or idea which can be altered, 
and the creative person must be able to spot these knobs and see which ones to twist 
Fig. 7.2  Somewhat superficial variations of the Rubik’s Cube

56
and how to generate variations that are creative (or, again, novel, effective, and 
whole).
Consider, for instance, the Rubik’s Cube. Now imagine you are tasked with cre-
ating other puzzles based on the Rubik’s Cube. What are some “knobs” that you can 
tweak to generate variations of the cube? One set of obvious variations is changing 
the colors and shapes of the stickers on the sides of the Rubik’s Cube. Figure 7.2 
gives some examples of variations of this nature—changing the shape of the stick-
ers, using it as a key chain, making them embossed or with jewels so that they can 
be solved by visually impaired individuals, or, the funniest of all, a Rubik’s Cube 
where all the sides are of the same color!
Alternatively, one can look at the Rubik’s Cube and wonder why the cube has to 
be a 3 × 3 × 3 cube? Changing this variable leads to another set of variations. For 
instance, Fig. 7.3 shows a 2 × 2 × 2, a 4 × 4 × 4, and a 5 × 5 × 5, variant of the origi-
nal Rubik’s Cube.
Another set of variations can emerge if the designer looks at the Rubik’s Cube 
and wonders whether it must be seen as n × n × n slices (3 × 3 × 3 in the original and 
other variations as shown in Fig. 7.3) or whether each of these slices needs to be of 
the same size. This leads to another set of variations as shown in Fig. 7.4, where the 
Rubik’s Cube is reenvisioned with dimensions of 2 × 2 × 3 or 3 × 2 × 3, but with 
different sizes, or 3 × 3 × 5 or 3 × 3 × 5 again with different sizes!

n × n × n!

57
Another set of variations can emerge if we notice that a cube is an example of a 
Platonic solid. What is sacrosanct about the Rubik’s Cube being a cube? Could it be 
a tetrahedron? An icosahedron or a dodecahedron? Figure 7.5 shows variations of 
the Rubik’s Cube based on other Platonic solids.
Finally, one can wonder why the Rubik’s Cube even needs to be constrained to 
the three-dimensional world we live in. Figure 7.6 presents the four-dimensional 
Hypercube puzzle. This puzzle of course cannot exist in the real world, but it exists 
in the form of a software program that you can manipulate on your computer! You 
can see a working version at http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm.
We must add that these are just few of the many variations of the Rubik’s Cube 
that have been developed by puzzle designers. An exhaustive list can be found at the 
website http://www.twistypuzzles.com (from which we have taken many of these 
examples).
So, what do these examples demonstrate? First, that one can generate an immense 
range of variations of the Rubik’s Cube by changing one variable at a time. However, 
these variations exist in a continuum from the obvious (changing the shape of the 
Fig. 7.5  Variations of the Rubik’s Cube based on other Platonic solids
Variance in Variations

58
sticker) to the less obvious or deep variations (puzzles that are based on seeing the 
cube as being a Platonic solid, or a three-dimensional object, and so on). But in each 
case, there is nothing magical happening. Even the most “distant” variations are 
based on (a) identifying one aspect of the original design and (b) varying it to create 
new designs.
Second, the kinds of variations generated depend greatly on identifying the right 
variable to tweak. The “deeper” the variable selected, the more novel the emergent 
designs are. Being able to identify deep variables clearly appears to be a function of 
knowledge of the field. Only someone with deep mathematical knowledge would 
know that a Rubik’s Cube is an example of a Platonic solid or that it is possible to 
think of it in four dimensions!
Is this Real Creativity?
Now we come to the heart of the question of creativity. An obvious challenge to the 
argument we have developed so far is that none of these variations of the Rubik’s 
Cube demonstrate real creativity. Real creativity, the critic could argue, belongs to 
Erno Rubik who came up with the Rubik’s Cube in the first place. Surely, his origi-
nal puzzle, so original in appearance, structure, approach, and method of play, was 
Fig. 7.6  A four-dimensional Rubik’s Hypercube puzzle (3 × 3 × 3 × 3) that exists only in software.

59
the true example of creative inspiration. Everyone else was just twisting or copying 
his idea. All the examples we have shown here are variations that depend com-
pletely on the first original work and insight that Rubik had. That was real creativity 
(or so the critic would say), the rest are just piggybacking on his idea.
To address this criticism, let us go back to the game we had described earlier in 
the chapter: Scott Kim’s Double Maze. When you read the description of Double 
Maze, did it occur to you that this was a variation of Rubik’s Cube? We would guess 
that it did not. On the face of it, the Rubik’s Cube and Double Maze are very differ-
ent. What is interesting though is that Scott Kim speaks to how Double Maze was 
actually inspired by the Rubik’s Cube, most specifically by the idea (variable) of 
simultaneity. Simultaneity in the case of the Rubik’s Cube is the fact that any move 
in the puzzle creates a simultaneous shift in the problem space; as you twist a sec-
tion of the cube, there’s a resultant shift in the position of other faces of the cube. 
This is what makes the Rubik’s Cube so difficult to solve—every move you make 
simultaneously changes the orientation and location of other parts of the puzzle.
It was this variable of simultaneity that Scott Kim focused on in constructing 
Double Maze (see Fig. 7.7). In both cases, we have combination puzzles where the 
problem solver must manage several aspects of the problem space simultaneously.
Thus, it was identifying and twisting a deep, or less obvious, variable that led to 
the design of a unique and creative puzzle. Yet the “creative” design is ultimately 
based on a variation on a common theme (combinations and/or simultaneity). The 
other variations on the cube that we initially described (variations in dimensionality, 
materials, colors, etc.) are still creative, but they seem perhaps a bit less novel and 
original, mainly because they twist the more obvious and visible surface themes. 
Many designers can spot the knobs of dimensionality in a Rubik’s cube, but it is the 
deeply knowledgeable creator that takes inspiration from the deeper notion of 
simultaneity and plays with ideas of space.
Scott Kim derived a variation that appears totally novel, because he focused in on 
a more complex variable. In order to see these less obvious variables and create 
highly novel variations, a person must have a wide variety of experiences and 
knowledge (background knowledge of the subject and diversity of knowledge in 
general). This allows them to spot the unusual knobs and twist them in novel, effec-
tive, and whole ways. The kinds of background knowledge people have may lead

them to see deep patterns as opposed to superficial ones, to perceive the less obvious 
themes as opposed to more noticeable ones.
Visualizing the Possibilities, What Matters
Designers create new games or puzzles based on how they think, what they know, 
and, most importantly, what possibilities they see. From here, their individual 
knowledge creativity can produce a wide spectrum of products. This wide spectrum 
may range from a rather commonplace piece of work that resembles what already 
exists to something that feels fresh, unique, beautiful, or cool yet still has clear roots 
in a pre-existing thing to something that feels so wildly different and original that it 
is hard to spot where it takes inspiration from; it feels like “its own thing.”
There is often a range of creative work shown in any medium—a spectrum of 
creative production (Csikszentmihalyi, 1996; Gardner, 1999). As Hofstadter (1985) 
argues, this range extends from very simple variations on a theme (in which a cre-
ator simply tweaks some obvious variables of an existing artifact or idea) to dra-
matic new combinations or twisting of unseen variables (in which a creator produces 
something that feels very original).
So, what accounts for this variability of creativity or the range of differences in 
how creative individuals see knobs and twist them accordingly? Why do some peo-
ple seem more able to see such possibilities and thus are more creative?
Creative work involves being able to look at what already exists and see the 
range of possible variations and how they might be altered to create something new. 
One of the main themes of the chapters in this book (specifically Chaps. 5, 8, and 
10) is that having a wide variety of background knowledge and varied experiences 
is central to the ability to come up with creative possibilities. The most creative 
work seems to arise not from merely tweaking the obvious variables but from work-
ing with variables many people cannot obviously see. Spotting more complex and 
less obvious variables (and seeing how they can be reconfigured) is more amenable 
to people with a wider diversity of experiences and depth of knowledge across dif-
ferent disciplines. This supplies a person with a richer repository of inspiration and 
the potential to see more prospects than people with narrower foundations.
A broad base of knowledge for seeing connections across disciplinary boundar-
ies is a foundation of transdisciplinary thinking (Root-Bernstein and Bernstein, 
1999; Freedman, 2003; Mishra, Koehler, & Henriksen, 2011). These ideas are 
explored in much greater depth in Henriksen & the Deep-Play Research Group 
(2017) and their pedagogical consequences in Chap. 5 in this book. And beyond 
this, it requires the ability to work across these disciplinary boundaries, to see con-
nections and ways of thinking that cut across them. This primes the mind for seeing 
novel connections, spotting unique knobs, and twisting or transforming them cre-
atively (Popova, 2012). It might all be summed up with the simple phrase, “the more 
you know, the more you see.”

Introduction
A dominant theme across current educational discourse, both in the popular media 
and in more academic writing, is that STEM education (science, technology, engi-
neering, and math) in America is in a state of crisis. For every article calling for the 
production of twenty-first century engineers—able and equipped to tackle the prob-
lems of society today—there are numerous others expressing grave concern for the 
field. This concern is twofold. First, it is argued that American STEM education 
does not produce the sheer number of qualified, technically competent professionals 
necessary for our ever-expanding and global economy (Business of Higher 
Education (BHEF), 2011; Maloney, 2007). Second, it is suggested that even those 
who are graduating often lack the quality and competence to meet emerging chal-
lenges (Chen, 2009). The challenges for engineers and other STEM professionals in 
the next decade range from topics of solar energy to urban infrastructure from vir-
tual reality to sustainability. With our growing population, changing climate, and 
mass consumption, there exist very real and daunting problems to be addressed.

And science and technology will have to play a crucial role in coming up with these 
solutions. As Dr. Cherry Murray argues, “This century will call on all fields to 
address the most compelling issues on the planet—call this ‘convergence’—and 
engineering will underpin them all” (Murray, 2011).
Despite this apparent agreement on the existence of a crisis, there is little consen-
sus on how to move forward, in other words, how to create a new educational para-
digm or approach that can best prepare our STEM graduates to meet these challenges. 
To successfully meet these challenges, engineering education must change. It must 
adopt competencies and skills associated not just with standard conventions of the 
discipline but with creativity, flexibility, transference across disciplines, and open-
ness to the new (one of the key themes of this book and described in greater detail in 
Chaps. 3, 5, 6, 7). We argue that one way to better understand how such changes can 
be brought about involves studying successful engineers and inventors and through 
that to identify strategies and approaches that worked for them. In Chap. 3 we high-
lighted mathematicians and scientists who were inspired by music. The two chapters 
following this one explore this connection between music and mathematics and 
computational thinking in greater detail as well. In this chapter we look toward two 
innovative engineers and designers, Nikola Tesla and Steve Jobs, for inspiration.
Tesla and Jobs
Nikola Tesla was one of the most prolific engineers of the early twentieth century. 
Often overshadowed in popular discourse by his contemporary Thomas Edison, 
Tesla played an integral role in the adoption of alternating current (AC) electricity, 
the invention of radio communication, advancements in X-ray technology, and 
countless other advancements of science and technology. At the turn of the twenti-
eth century, at a time was just beginning to understand how electricity, radio waves, 
and energy could each be harnessed, Tesla tinkered with wireless telegraphy and 
electrical currents.
Fast forward to the turn of the twenty-first century, where Steve Jobs and his 
team tinkered with Gorilla Glass and Bluetooth connectivity to develop some of the 
most coveted and iconic technologies of today, from the first generation iPod with 
the click wheel to the sleek screen of the iPad. For these two iconic engineers, both 
the existing technologies and the foreseeable potential for new technologies could 
not have been in more different places. And yet, only 12 years separated their lives. 
Such is the rapid pace of change.
Both Jobs and Tesla were revolutionary thinkers, pushing the boundaries of 
knowledge and experimentation, and few would question their contributions to sci-
ence and technology. But more importantly for us, both Jobs and Tesla demon-
strated a set of skills and abilities not usually associated with that of the conventionally 
proficient engineer or scientist. They displayed an ability to conceptualize, design, 
and think holistically about engineering problems. For Tesla and Jobs, the answers 
weren’t found in a new computational equation or theorem. Instead, the answers 
8  Square Peg, Round Hole, Good Engineering

67
were identified through a completely new approach, rich with not only engineering 
prowess but also broad-minded and cross-disciplinary creative competencies.
For instance, Tesla’s brilliance came not just from his knowledge of engineering, 
though there is no doubt of his skills in that arena, but rather from his unique ability 
to conceptualize and think visually about an apparatus or a problem. As he said:
My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get a new idea, I start at once 
building it up in my imagination, and make improvements and operate the device in my 
mind…When I have gone so far as to embody everything in my invention, every possible 
improvement I can think of, and when I see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete form the 
final product of my brain. (Tesla, 2007, p. 19)
As Miller (1996) notes, the importance of visual imagination in Tesla’s work, 
and in the history of great scientific thought overall, cannot (and should not) be 
ignored. Miller goes on to argue that the most talented people in STEM disciplines 
have developed competencies for creative thinking which they carry out through 
mental and visual imagery (Miller, 1996). For Tesla, great engineering was heavily 
reliant on a strong conceptual understanding, complemented by the ability to imag-
ine things visually, to design and consider the entirety of a concept with imagery 
before ever dealing with equations. Again, quoting Tesla:
Before I put a sketch on paper, the whole idea is worked out mentally. In my mind I change 
the construction, make improvements, and even operate the device. Without ever having 
drawn a sketch I can give the measurements of all parts to workmen, and when completed 
all these parts will fit, just as certainly as though I had made the actual drawings. (Tesla 
quoted in O’Neill, 2007, p. 257)
Tesla was openly critical of fellow engineers who over emphasized equations 
and theorems. Such an approach diminishes an idea’s real-world applicability. He 
explained, “Today’s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and 
they wander off through equation after equation and eventually build a structure 
which has no relation to reality” (Belohlavek & Wagner, 2008, p.81).
Steve Jobs, in contrast to Tesla, was not often regarded as a top-notch engineer. 
He was considered a bit of a showman, more concerned with the aesthetics of the 
objects he designed than being involved with the actual engineering. That said, one 
thing does join these two individuals. Just as Tesla brought his strong unique per-
sonal ability to the engineering design task, Steve Jobs brought his own unique sen-
sibility to the design of devices and technologies, and his contribution to the global 
market, popular culture, and technology is undeniable. While many companies prof-
ited from the technological boom of the late twentieth century and early twenty-first 
century, Apple stood out because of the aesthetic quality of their products which 
became so deeply embedded in the culture and lives of consumers that they have 
developed a tremendous and devoted cult-like following. From the iPad to iPhone to 
iMac, from the Apple store to the Apple website, Apple sought to create a user expe-
rience rich with design, simplicity, intuitiveness, and advanced technology.
For Jobs, engineering a new product wasn’t simply the pursuit of a new additive 
feature (the dreaded “featuritis” that plagues most software and hardware). Instead, 
it was about finding innovation that improved the device as a whole. And while 
Tesla and Jobs

68
Apple products are often described as “beautiful” or “elegant,” design was much 
more intentional for Jobs. As Jobs stated:
Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you 
dig deeper, it’s really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn’t what it looked like, 
although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really 
well, you have to get it. You have to really “grok” what it’s all about. It takes a passionate 
commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swal-
low it. Most people don’t take the time to do that” (Wolf, 1996).
During a Stanford commencement address, Jobs famously detailed how his 
appreciation of design, and through that Apple’s famous aesthetic, emerged from his 
own interest being piqued while sitting in on a calligraphy course in college. 
Ironically, it was a course he attended after having withdrawn from the university 
itself. This primary experience led to others and culminated in the Macintosh being 
the first computer to offer real fonts and typefaces. This concern for type and design 
was not just an add-on but rather integral to the Apple experience—a concern that the 
company emphasizes to this day. The key point here is that Jobs integrated a diverse 
and unique array of competencies and experiences into his own engineering and that 
helped him to design in ways that were unique, creative, and aesthetic. Said differ-
ently and more simply, for Jobs, engineering problems weren’t only solved through 
equations or modifications. He emphasized the value of diverse experiences:
A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have 
enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspec-
tive on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better 
design we will have (Wolf, 1996).
We must add that this focus on cross-disciplinary thinking and creativity is not to 
downplay the technical skills and knowledge that engineers (or Tesla or Jobs for that 
matter) bring to the complex craft of design and engineering. Creativity in engineer-
ing cannot happen without deep knowledge of mathematics, engineering, or other 
technical fields. But the important point for us as educators is to understand that 
technical skills and knowledge, while necessary, are not sufficient, in and of them-
selves, to engender creative solutions.
Tesla and Jobs are not alone in having abilities that spanned disciplines of ways 
of thinking. Countless examples of talented thinkers in science and mathematics 
reveal that creative individuals tend to think this way (Root-Bernstein and Bernstein, 
1999). For example, Mlodinow (2003) points out that the great physicist Richard 
Feynman’s ability to solve problems in physics came not just from knowledge of 
equations but from Feynman’s imaginative approach in which physicists must 
“wave our hands, use analogies with simpler systems, draw pictures, and make 
plausible guesses” (Mlodinow, 2003, p. 61). This was Feynman’s trademark style—
building not just on pure mathematics but through the focused use of a powerful and 
vivid imagination paired with knowledge of the discipline. Feynman also spoke of 
the role of beauty in scientific ideation, suggesting, for instance, that one of the main 
reasons for Descartes seeking to understand the physics of rainbows had as much to 
8  Square Peg, Round Hole, Good Engineering

69
do with the inherent beauty of rainbows as it had to do with the pleasure of figuring 
things out (Mlodinow, 2003).
Of course, any insights that Feynman arrived at needed to be represented math-
ematically just as Tesla’s visualizations and Jobs’ aesthetic concerns needed to lead 
to functional machines and products. All that said, it is important to note that cre-
ation was driven not by an equation but rather by a deeper connection between dif-
ferent disciplinary approaches. Engineering and problem solving for such skilled 
and successful thinkers most notably comes from a wider matrix of imagination, 
abilities, skills, and curiosities or cultivated interests in other disciplines.
We argue such boundary crossing thinking is what needed today. Tesla and Jobs 
demonstrated the kinds of skills, knowledge, and ability to transfer ideas between 
domains that modern engineers, we argue, ought to adopt to meet the demands of 
the present and future. Given the engineering challenges of today, such broad-­
minded cognitive abilities are needed in STEM fields and in STEM education more 
so than ever before. But in order for modern engineers or scientists to develop these 
faculties, STEM educators must intentionally incorporate pedagogy to support this 
shift in engineering education.
Rethinking the Engineering Focus
Herb Simon, in his classic work The Sciences of the Artificial, noted how around 
two or three decades after World War II, engineering education specifically (and 
professional education in general) changed drastically. He argued:
Engineering schools gradually became schools of physics and mathematics; medical 
schools became schools of biological science; business schools became schools of finite 
mathematics. The use of adjectives like “applied” concealed, but did not change, the fact. It 
simply meant that in the professional schools those topics were selected from mathematics 
and the natural sciences for emphasis, which were thought to be most nearly relevant to 
professional practice. (Simon, 1996, p. 111)
According to Simon, this had to do with a range of reasons but most primarily 
because these institutions “hankered after academic responsibility” and chose to go 
with topics that were “intellectually tough, analytic, formalizable and teachable” 
(Simon, 1996, p. 112). This was in contrast to topics and approaches, such as real-­
world design, that were considered to be “intellectually soft, intuitive, informal, and 
cookbooky” (Simon, 1996, p. 112).
These factors are now shifting as engineering and STEM have become sectors of 
education under deep scrutiny. From elementary to secondary and beyond, count-
less articles and op-ed’s call for strengthened interdisciplinary studies, heightened 
humanistic and interpersonal skill development, and greater integration of proper 
technology to fit the curriculum. Creative thought processes and transferrable 
knowledge across disciplines are considered an increased necessity for achievement 
in our multifaceted and interdependent society (Florida, 2002; Freedman, 2007).
Rethinking the Engineering Focus

70
A strong engineering/STEM education must certainly have a focus on pedagogy 
of calculus, thermodynamics, metallurgy, and other traditional engineering disci-
plines. But it is also necessary to heighten and advance skills in the humanities, 
design, and social sciences and promote abilities like creativity and abstract and 
critical thinking. This is analogous to Dr. Murray’s comment, “The engineers of the 
future will likely be ‘T-shaped thinkers,’ deep in one field but able to work across all 
fields and communicate well” (Murray, 2011).
We suggest that the most relevant and applicable framework for blending and 
promoting these needs and goals in STEM disciplines is transdisciplinary thinking 
or what we have called (in)disciplined learning (see Chap. 5 in this book as well as 
Mishra, Koehler & Henriksen, 2011 and Henriksen & the Deep-Play Research 
Group, 2017 for a deeper discussion of transdisciplinary thinking). With a focus on 
creativity and thinking across disciplines, we suggest that this framework offers a 
good fit for promoting divergent and effective thinking abilities.
Our discussion of Tesla and Jobs demonstrates that it is not always possible to 
tell exactly where a talented creative individual’s inspiration and abilities may come 
from, because inspiration varies by individual, their interests, background, skills, 
and talent. For Tesla, it happened to be his own unique interest and ability for visual 
thinking and abstraction and his desire to work in more practical and “real-world” 
settings and applications (unlike some of his solely “equation-focused” contempo-
raries that he bemoaned). Jobs drew inspiration through other varied topics and 
experiences he encountered in life and in the world around him (his calligraphy 
interest was just one of many unique interests). Tesla and Jobs demonstrated excep-
tional brilliance in the content knowledge of their respective disciplines. It was their 
secondary and tertiary skills, however, that distinctly defined their work.
Conclusion
Where and how the creative spark will strike is difficult to predict, but we do know 
that ideas do not usually emerge solely from within their own STEM discipline. In 
contrast, the evidence indicates that they are often created and enhanced through 
outside disciplines, interests, and experiences and then fully worked through and 
realized in the context of strong core disciplinary knowledge. We can also say that 
they will emerge through creative cognition, from divergent and cross-disciplinary 
sources and experiences. Given this, it is important that we provide a range of broad 
and varied educational experiences to students in engineering and STEM fields. It is 
in fact essential that such curricula not be one-sided or solely focused in STEM 
content alone. Rather, we argue that a certain amount of richly varied liberal arts 
learning should be woven into the curricula of such subjects. Engineers, and other 
individuals in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, must be 
able to pull from tertiary subjects, disciplines, skills, and experiences to enhance 
their own problem solving and creative abilities. As we begin to understand the sci-
ence and engineering demands of our world in this twenty-first century, it becomes 
8  Square Peg, Round Hole, Good Engineering

71
clear that students in these fields must have the kinds of thoughtful and varied learn-
ing experiences that enable them to think richly and broadly, both within, outside of, 
and across the disciplines.

Introduction
Learning to use digital technologies in creative ways requires more than merely 
knowing how to use specific software programs. A key aspect of becoming creative 
with computers has to do with knowing how to control computers—to program 
them. Programming, however, is rarely seen as being a creative activity. It is instead 
perceived as being sequential, driven by logic and mathematics, providing little in 
the way of creative opportunity. In this chapter we seek to push against this idea, 
using the lens of computational thinking to look at how working with digital tech-
nologies at the programming level can actually lead to creative output or at the very 
least serve as a creative partner to the designer or the artist.

Introducing Computational Thinking
Computational thinking draws on fundamental computer science concepts but is dis-
tinct from computer science. It focuses on problem-solving through “seeking algorith-
mic approaches to problem domains; a readiness to move between differing levels of 
abstraction and representation; familiarity with decomposition; separation of concerns; 
and modularity” (Barr & Stephenson, 2011, pp. 49–50). In fact, some even argue that 
computational thinking is an approach that does not necessarily need programming of 
computers but rather is an approach to problem-solving that uses strategies such as 
algorithms, abstraction, and debugging (Yadav, Zhou, Mayfield, Hambrusch, & Korb, 
2011). Along the same lines, Bundy (2007) argued that the ability to think computa-
tionally is essential to conceptual understanding in every discipline.
Computational thinking is aided significantly by the ubiquitous availability of 
the digital computer, cheaper hardware, as well as better software for data analysis. 
The fact that computational thinking is not just limited to computer science but is 
also applicable across disciplines has been used to argue that computational think-
ing can be regarded as a fundamental, basic skill that all children need to develop 
(Wing, 2006). As Wing wrote, “To reading, writing, and arithmetic, we should add 
computational thinking to every child’s analytical ability” (p. 33). The National 
Research Council (NRC) further echoed this assertion suggesting that computa-
tional thinking is a cognitive skill which is of use to everybody (NRC, 2010). The 
NRC report also highlighted the connections between computational thinking and 
disciplinary knowledge. It suggested that, “(1) that students can learn thinking strat-
egies such as computational thinking as they study a discipline, (2) that teachers and 
curricula can model these strategies for students, and (3) that appropriate guidance 
can enable students to learn to use these strategies independently” (p. 62).
The pervasiveness of computational thinking underscores the importance of expos-
ing students to these ways of thinking and their application in the real world. 
Hemmendinger (2010) argued that the goal of teaching computational thinking is not 
for everyone to think like a computer scientist but “to teach them how to think like an 
economist, a physicist, an artist, and to understand how to use computation to solve their 
problems, to create, and to discover new questions that can fruitfully be explored” (p. 6).
Computational Thinking and Creativity
Recently, computer science educators have underscored the importance of creativity 
by incorporating creative processes as one of the big ideas of computer science (The 
College Board, 2012). The College Board has argued that computing is a creative 
human activity that facilitates exploration and creation of knowledge, enables inno-
vation, and allows individuals to create personally meaningful artifacts. The 
Computer Science Teacher Association suggested that computational thinking uses 
“a set of concepts, such as abstraction, recursion, and iteration to process and 
9  Of Art and Algorithms

75
analyze data, and to create real and virtual artifacts” (Barr & Stephenson, 2011, 
p. 51). Computational thinking also draws upon a set of transdisciplinary skills that 
we have argued (Mishra, Koehler, & Henriksen, 2011) are essential for creativity.
It has been suggested that computational thinking can foster creativity by allowing 
students to not only be consumers of technology but also designers of technology, 
building tools that can have significant impact on society. This emphasis on creativity 
can be seen in a new computer science course currently being developed and piloted 
by the College Board called CS Principles. The core argument for including creativity 
in this mix is that computing not only extends traditional forms of human expression 
but also allows the creation of new forms of expression (The College Board, 2012).
This idea of new forms of expression is worth exploring further. Though much of 
the emphasis of computational thinking has been on what has been called “big data” 
(the combination of today’s access to immense amounts of human behavior data 
alongside the capabilities of new computational tools for real-time analysis and 
representation), there is more to computational thinking than that. We argue that 
computational thinking goes beyond typical human-computer interactions in which 
humans initiate the actions that are then computed by the machine. The new forms 
of expression that are emerging today have significant implications for how we 
engage and interact with machines. In this brave new world, machines take on a role 
in the creative process itself—partners to humans as it were. Seeing the computer in 
this light has significant implications for how we educate our students for the jobs 
of the future. Looking forward, we see that human initiative must blend with the 
capabilities of software programs in ways that have not been possible.
From Tool to Partner
We are now seeing the rise of a generation of technology enthusiasts and creators 
who are both computationally savvy and deeply knowledgeable about their field of 
interest. Consider for instance data-driven election forecasting from people like 
Nate Silver. Silver (the statistician whose FiveThirtyEight.com blog became an 
online phenomenon of the past few elections), and Sam Wang (a Princeton neuro-
scientist and a “spare time” election forecaster), upended the “seat-of-the-pants,” 
gut-feeling-driven predictions made by most established political prognosticators 
and pundits. A long history of relying on polls or talking heads to predict election 
results has been undermined by a group of self-described “geeks” and number 
crunchers. Armed with computational simulations, data sets, and algorithms, these 
data crunchers appear to be increasingly accurate in their predictions.
This is not to suggest that these prognosticators are infallible. The fact that some 
of the predictions can also go wrong (as the 2016 elections so dramatically showed) 
indicate that there is still an art to the process, as it were. That said it cannot be 
argued that data-driven computational thinking has unquestionably been influential 
in recent campaign strategies, particularly the manner in which the Obama and, 
more recently, the Trump campaigns used data to micro-target voters. Building on

work first conducted during Rick Perry’s gubernatorial campaign in Texas, presi-
dential campaigns today slice and dice polling data, voter information, and hun-
dreds of other variables to pinpoint and customize voter registration, campaign 
mailings, television advertising, and door-to-door drives integrated with social 
media campaigns. This change in thinking about how campaigns operate parallels a 
similar shift toward statistical and computational thinking that occurred in baseball 
a decade or so ago (as documented by Michael Lewis’ in his book Money Ball, 
which was also the basis of the movie with the same name).
Nate Silver, Sam Wang, and the number crunchers in Money Ball are prime 
examples of experts who bring both a deep understanding of computation (numbers 
and statistical techniques) and of the subject matter knowledge (political process or 
sports as the case may be) to their work. It is this combination knowledge of data 
and the domain that makes them successful (at least most of the time).
What this means is that the digital computer is no longer a tool but rather a partner in 
the cognitive process of analyzing data and making predictions. The fact that errors do 
occur support the idea that this is both an art and a science, a partnership between the 
human expert and the computer and its numerical skills. We will end with two examples 
of how computational thinking, in combination with deep knowledge of a discipline, can 
lead to creative solutions, far greater than could have been possible by just the human 
working alone. In this perspective, the creative output is not determined either by only 
the individual or the technology but rather through a “partnership” between the two.
New Forms of Creativity, Two Examples
For our first example, we focus on David Cope, a noted musician and composer, 
who has been experimenting for years with computer programs that create original 
music (Blitstein, 2010). At the beginning, he created a computer program EMI 
(Experiments in Musical Intelligence also known as Emmy) that composed music 
in the style of different historical composers. The music created by Emmy was so 
impressive that scholars of music often failed to identify them as being computer-­
generated. This of course raised some fundamental questions about creativity, such 
as who was the author of the pieces thus generated?
David Cope, however, was not troubled by these concerns since in his opinion Emmy 
was merely a tool. Everything Emmy created, she created because of software he devised. 
He argued that if he had infinite time, he could have written 5000 Bach-style chorales. 
The program just did it much faster. As he said, “All the computer is just an extension of 
me. They’re nothing but wonderfully organized shovels. I wouldn’t give credit to the 
shovel for digging the hole. Would you?” (All the quotes are from Blitstein, 2010).
But as it turns out, Cope eventually got tired of his first program, successful though 
it was, and he began experimenting with a different kind of virtual composer. This time 
he wanted to build something “with its own personality.” This program would be more 
of a collaborator. Underlying the computer program is what he describes as an “asso-
ciation network”—certain musical statements and relationships between notes are

weighted as “good,” others as “bad.” This new program, called Emily Howell, would 
not print out a full score as the previous program Emmy did but rather engaged in a 
conversation with Cope through the keyboard and the mouse. He would ask it what he 
called “a musical question,” a piece of a composition or musical phrase. The program 
would then respond with a composition which Cope would either choose to accept or 
not. He would at times tweak the composition created by the software, feed it back to 
the machine, and ask it to generate a newer piece. Eventually, the exchange would 
result in a composition that was acceptable to him. Cope compares this process to a 
sculptor who chops raw shapes out of a block of marble before he teases out the details. 
Using quick-and-dirty programs as an extension of his brain has made him extraordi-
narily prolific (he has even published recordings with Emily Howell as a co-composer). 
In our context, it also makes this an excellent example of the creativity that emerges 
from combining computational thinking with deep knowledge of a discipline.
Our second example comes from the field of visual design. Christopher Carlson 
handles technical communication and strategy for Wolfram, the creators of 
Mathematica, a powerful computer program used by scientists, engineers, mathe-
maticians, and computer scientists. He also has an interest in graphic design and 
architecture and describes one of his “enduring passions” as “exploring graphic 
design with programmatic and generative systems” (Carlson, 2009a). In other 
words, he explores the world of design using computational tools. In an article titled 
“Exploring Logo Designs with Mathematica,” Christopher shows how one can 
mathematically develop variations on commercial logo designs by the systematic 
tweaking of various parameters (Carlson, 2009a) consistent with the vision of cre-
ativity that we have been developing in this book—that of creativity as seeking 
variations on a theme through the “tweaking of conceptual knobs.” He works with 
corporate logos because of certain inherent features they all share. As he says, logos 
“often distill a single idea into simplified geometric form that is straightforward to 
parameterize in Mathematica. Once a logo is in Mathematica, exploring its param-
eter space quickly leads to the discovery of new graphic phenomena, emergent 
forms, unexpected relationships, and burgeoning lines of inquiry.” (All the quotes 
are from Carlson, 2009a, unless noted otherwise.) For examples, Christopher 
explored the Mercedes-Benz logo with his program. He started by writing some 
Mathematica code to recreate the logo with (in his words) “some obvious parame-
ters controlling the number of points on the star, the sharpness of the star’s points, 
the thickness of the outer circle, and the orientation of the star” (Fig. 9.1). He then 
set about tweaking the parameters, and the program began to spit out lots and lots of 
variations. The range of possibilities that emerged is impressive, many of which 
could be the starting point for the design of other corporate logos (see Fig. 9.2 for a 
sample of the variations that emerged). Christopher expanded his range to include 
other logos and then went forward and started combining them together, leading to 
visual solutions that, as he describes them, led him to a “world inhabited by sea 
creatures and whorled growths, forms with a pleasing balance of rigid symmetry 
and organic irregularity” (Carlson, 2009b). Interestingly Christopher’s description 
of his exploration has a conversational quality quite akin to the dialogue between 
David Cope and his software program.
New Forms of Creativity, Two Examples

78
What is interesting in this example is the partnership that emerged between a soft-
ware program (in this case Mathematica) and the designer. The computer does what it 
is good at, creating, almost instantaneously, a huge number of variations. This does not 
mean that the designer does not have a role in the creative process. We argue that the

79
software is not a replacement of the creator but rather is a great tool to automatically 
generate a range of variations on a theme based on a set of parameters from the designer.
As the research on creativity shows, this phase of open ideation is a critical part 
of the creative process. However, this does not mean that humans are out of the 
picture totally. In fact, the designer has two very critical roles to play here.
The first important task the designer accomplishes is in choosing which param-
eters to include in writing the original code. That is not at all obvious and needs 
careful thought. In the case of the logo, Carlson had to decide whether he needed to 
include the thickness of the outer circle as a parameter. What about color?
In the case of the program written by David Cope, the parameters of the musical 
choice and options that the program could “play with” were put into place by Cope 
himself. This is important since there are volumes of options, and the choices are 
nontrivial. Setting and tweaking different parameters will lead to very different

80
solutions. These parameters can only be determined and set by a person who com-
bines computational thinking with deep knowledge of a domain (music in the case 
of David Cope and graphic design in the case of Chris Carlson).
The second place where humans step in is after all these variations have been cre-
ated (and the computer creates lots of them). In graphic design, for example, human 
insight is needed for selecting one of the solutions for its appropriateness to the orga-
nization for whom the logo is being designed, finding the right aesthetic look, under-
standing the context of use (on a website, on a car dashboard, in a neon sign?), and so 
on. In David Cope’s case, the role of the human is even more complicated since the 
composer can go back and input changes into the first piece developed by the program 
and then feed it back into the program in a continual and ever-evolving feedback loop.
In each of these cases, human creativity is augmented by computational thinking 
and, in particular, the automation of problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. 
Computational thinking allows each individual to become more creative and pro-
ductive. None of this is possible, however, without the designer or composer having 
computational thinking skills. For instance, programming is not something we typi-
cally teach in design school. But as is clear, a designer with a good visual sense and 
a knowledge of programming and mathematics is going to be much more efficient 
and generative (in terms of total ideas) than one with just the former. Similarly, a 
programmer without a good understanding of the domain is less likely to be cre-
ative. The human element is still present, just refracted through the lens of the com-
putational tool. Taking advantage of these new tools requires a new set of 
skills—computational thinking plus—where an awareness and knowledge of the 
technology is combined with the aesthetic sensibility of an artist or designer.
Conclusion
There were three main points we made here. First, for a range of reasons computa-
tional thinking needs to become a key part of our intellectual curriculum. Second, 
the partnership of deep human content knowledge and technology can lead to deeper 
and more profound creative insights. Finally, the addition of computational thinking 
to the creative process does not in any way diminish the role of the human. In fact, 
human intuition and agency play a key role in this process.
At a recent MIT conference on big data, one of the leaders of the conference was asked 
what makes a good data scientist. She noted that while knowledge of computer science and 
mathematics was clearly necessary, just as important were imaginative capacities like innova-
tive thinking and a “deep, wide-ranging curiosity.” The New York Times (Lohr, 2012) article 
reporting on the conference spoke of the consensus emerging among the participants:
Listening to the data is important… but so is experience and intuition. After all, what is 
intuition at its best but large amounts of data of all kinds filtered through a human brain 
rather than a math model?

Nate Silver (one of the creative people who have managed to combine computational 
thinking with a deep understanding of politics to become one of the best election fore-
casters in the business) would agree. In an interview with Fast Company, he said that one 
of the important tasks is to develop, “an intuitive sense—one that is honed and refined 
through experience—for what’s meaningful” (Baer, 2012). It is this appreciation of 
meaning-making, of knowing deeply the domain of work as well as its broader purposes, 
that is key to the thoughtful and creative uses of our increasingly powerful digital tools.

Creativity in Mathematics and Beyond
For mathematicians, mathematics—like music, poetry, or painting—is a creative art. All 
these arts involve—and indeed require—a certain creative fire. They all strive to express 
truths that cannot be expressed in ordinary everyday language. And they all strive towards 
beauty.

Introduction
Every 4 years, the International Mathematical Union recognizes 2 to 4 individuals under the 
age of 40 for their achievements in mathematics. These awards, known as the Fields Medal, 
have often been described as the “mathematician’s Nobel Prize” and serve both a form of 
peer recognition of highly influential and creative mathematical work as well as an encour-
agement of future achievement. In 2014, four individuals received this prestigious award.
The 2014 awardees were also unique in a range of other dimensions as well. For 
instance, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first woman—as well as the first Iranian—
to receive this accolade. And another winner, Artur Avila, was the first Latin 
American. Manjul Bhargava of Indian, Canadian, and American roots and Austrian 
mathematician and Professor Martin Hairer were the other two winners. Each of 
them significantly advanced mathematics through their work in areas as specialized

and diverse as dynamical systems theory, the geometry of numbers, stochastic par-
tial differential equations, and the dynamical geometry of Reimann surfaces.
An award such as the Fields Medal is a recognition of sustained creative effort of the 
highest caliber in a challenging domain, making the recipients worthy of study for 
scholars interested in creativity. In doing so, we continue a long tradition in creativity 
research, going all the way back to Galton in the nineteenth century, of studying highly 
accomplished individuals to better understand the nature of the creative process. We 
must point out that the focus of creativity research has shifted over time, moving from 
an early dominant focus on genius, toward giftedness in the middle of the twentieth 
century, to a more contemporary emphasis on originality of thought and work (Getzels, 
1987). Our work lies firmly in the latter category in that we do not see these individuals 
as having “miraculous” creative powers but rather as having habits of mind that may be 
accessible to most if not all of us. Throughout this book, and specifically in Chaps. 2, 6, 
and 7, we have critiqued a perspective that saw creativity as something mysterious by 
arguing for a more prosaic perspective, where the creativity is a result of normal human 
cognition, and thus available to all, though, as in all human abilities, there can be great 
variability across individuals. This variability is based on the presence of absence of 
certain innate talents as well as skills developed by practice that build on their expertise 
of a particular discipline as well as experiences in domains outside of that discipline.
Thus, studying highly creative individuals, such as the Fields Medal winners, can 
provide useful cases of creative processes that can inform our thinking (even though 
their disciplinary work and knowledge may not be as easily accessible to us). This is 
similar to an early study of the habits and approaches of highly creative teachers that 
led to conclusions that apply more broadly to all teachers (Henriksen & Mishra, 2015).
Creative Avocations
Research has shown that creative individuals often develop their ideas from interests 
outside of their domain of expertise (see Chap. 5 for a more detailed description). For 
instance, one of the important conclusions drawn from our study of highly creative 
teachers was that each of them spoke of their outside interests (their personal avoca-
tions) as being key to their creativity in their professional lives (Henriksen & Mishra, 
2015). Our research highlighted many instances in which accomplished, award-win-
ning teachers used cross-curricular connections in their teaching of the subject matter. 
For example, these teachers frequently incorporated the arts or drama in teaching sci-
ence. These teachers used their personal passions and interests to ignite creativity and 
wonder in their teaching. They also used these personal avocations to shape the subject 
matter. This is consistent with our description of two highly creative engineers (Nikoli 
Tesla and Steve Jobs) and the manner in which their outside interests and creative 
avocations were the foundation of their creative output (see Chap. 8, in this book).
This is where our Fields Medal winners come into the story. These four individu-
als pushed the boundaries of their domain, in valuable and innovative ways as recog-
nized by their peers. It is important to remember that the recognition of their creativity

lies as much in their own work in the domain of mathematics as it does in the gate-
keepers of the field who selected them for the award (a point made first in 
Csikszentmihalyi, 1996 and emphasized in Chap. 4 of this book as well). That said, 
these four mathematicians offer useful case studies of highly creative individuals 
allowing us to see what attributes cut across their very diverse backgrounds and work.
Back to the Fields Medal Winners
Our approach was simple: for each of the four winners, we read and reviewed the 
official press releases, award descriptions, interviews, and biographical sketches 
released alongside the news of their awards. We did this to better understand how 
they both selected and approached the problems they worked on, their personal inter-
ests and avocations outside of mathematics, and the intersection of their work and 
creative thinking. Since Fields Medal winners become mini-celebrities around the 
time they win the awards, we were able to use online resources like Math Union and 
Quanta Magazine to develop insights into their professional and personal lives. We 
were interested in examples where they described the nature of their personal life and 
their hobbies outside of work. Below we present brief profiles of these individuals.
Manjul Bhargava  Creativity and varied interests were quite obvious in Manjul 
Bhargava’s case. The influence of music in his mathematical profession speaks of a 
unique and inspiring relationship. Born in Canada and rooted in India, Bhargava 
lived in the United States most of his life and now works as a professor at Princeton 
University. Although he was born to a mathematician mother, Bhargava shared his 
earliest experiences of learning mathematics through the rhythms of his grandfa-
ther’s teachings of Sanskrit poetry. He finds a lot of similarities in mathematics and 
music, or any art for that matter. He explained these similarities using a common 
concept that drives mathematicians and artists equally, “the concept of trying to 
understand ourselves and the world around us,” or perhaps, the search for truth and 
beauty. In Bhargava’s case, both math and art drive him forward in creative ways.
According to Bhargava, “one key way to solving any mathematical problem…is to 
think of it in a totally different way.” Bhargava’s big revelation came while he was 
playing with a Rubik’s Cube, though this is not the only place where he finds numbers 
and mathematics. According to his interview with Quanta Magazine (2014):
[N]umbers take positions in space—on the corners of a Rubik’s Cube, or the two-­dimensional 
layout of the Sanskrit alphabet, or a pile of oranges brought home from the supermarket. And 
they move through time, in the rhythms of a Sanskrit poem or a tabla drumming sequence. 
Being an expert tabla (an Indian percussion instrument) player helps Manjul 
Bhargava’s understanding of math. Playing the tabla, according to him, is quite simi-
lar to doing math. He often “turns to the tabla when he is stuck on a mathematical 
problem, and vice versa…Indian classical music—like number theory research—is 
largely improvisational” (Klarreich, 2014b). In an interview to Quanta Magazine he 
explained, “There’s some problem-solving, but you’re also trying to say something

86
artistic…It’s similar to math—you have to put together a sequence of ideas that 
enlightens you.” In his interview with the Times of India, Bhargava makes clear 
cross-disciplinary connections to his personal creative avocations:
I always found the three subjects—music, poetry, and mathematics—very similar. In fact, I 
find that I think about them all in very similar ways. In school, mathematics is generally 
grouped in the ‘science’ category. But for mathematicians, mathematics—like music, 
poetry, or painting—is a creative art. All these arts involve—and indeed require—a certain 
creative fire. They all strive to express truths that cannot be expressed in ordinary everyday 
language. And they all strive towards beauty. (Rajghatta, 2014)
As an impressionable child, Bharagava saw mathematics everywhere. For 
instance, he sometimes multiplied large numbers for his mother, who had discov-
ered this way to keep her high-spirited son still, or in another instance, he tried to 
calculate the formula behind piling a pyramid from oranges. In considering such 
background and examples of thinking without rigid disciplinary boundaries, it is 
clear that Manjul Bharagava’s musical and mathematical journey is richly varied 
and cuts across the landscape of domains.
Maryam Mirzakhani  A professor of mathematics at Stanford University, Iranian 
Maryam Mirzakhani did not always want to become a mathematician. She loved 
reading novels and wanted to become a writer. As she got older, she realized she 
actually enjoyed mathematics, especially geometric structures. Unlike many math-
ematicians, she considers herself “slow” in process because she enjoys ruminating 
over complicated and deep problems for years. She prefers solo time when she is not 
working. When she thinks about mathematical problems, she sits and visualizes.
She explained her process of working on a difficult math problem as “You don’t 
want to write down all the details—the process of drawing something helps you 
somehow to stay connected.” Constantly drawing and sketching geometric struc-
tures on large sheets of paper spread across the floor, Mirzakhani manifests a sense 
of wonder and deep play. In her interview describing how she does mathematics 
through creating elaborate stories in her mind, she commented:
There are different characters, and you are getting to know them better…Things evolve, and 
then you look back at a character, and it’s completely different from your first impression. 
(Klarreich, 2014a)
Mirzakhani doodles her ideas on giant sheets of paper. She said this confuses her 
daughter, who thinks her mother is a painter. But this may not be farfetched. Mirzakhani 
noted how she enjoys crossing disciplinary boundaries and making connections:
I like crossing the imaginary boundaries people set up between different fields—it’s very 
refreshing…there are lots of tools, and you don’t know which one would work…It’s about 
being optimistic and trying to connect things. (Klarreich, 2014a)
Mirzakhani’s urge to go beyond the conventional boundaries of her field gives her 
the skill to make connections other mathematicians often miss. This is why even her 
colleagues feel that she tends to devise solutions to problems previously considered 
unapproachable. This skill is an integral part of who she is. Based on her personal 
experience, she does not believe that life is easy, “You have to ignore low-hanging 
10  Creativity in Mathematics and Beyond

87
fruit, which is a little tricky…I’m not sure if it’s the best way of doing things, actu-
ally—you’re torturing yourself along the way…Life isn’t supposed to be easy.”
In defining her most rewarding experiences as a mathematician, Mirzakhani 
alluded to the idea of wonder, just like Bhargava, stating:
The most rewarding part is the ‘Aha’ moment, the excitement of discovery and enjoyment 
of understanding something new—the feeling of being on top of a hill and having a clear 
view. But most of the time, doing mathematics for me is like being on a long hike with no 
trail and no end in sight. (Mirzakhani, 2014)
Martin Hairer  Martin Hairer is a professor of mathematics at The University of 
Warwick, Austria. Although he graduated with a PhD in physics, he told Quanta 
Magazine that he always knew “it was really a PhD in mathematics.” Born to a 
mathematician father, his proclivity toward mathematics shaped how he saw the 
world from the very beginning. Even in his work as a student in physics, he tried to 
understand the math behind ideas. His disciplinary lens strongly influences how he 
perceives the world, as he believes that “no matter what you are doing, if you genu-
inely care about a problem, it is always in the back of your mind.” Like Bhargava 
and Mirzakhani, when he is not working on a mathematical problem, he is still 
mentally working a mathematical problem. He finds math in cooking, in music, and 
in everything he does. This perception led him to find “music in noisy equations,” 
which became the masterpiece that brought him the Fields Medal.
Known for his “speed and creativity” among his colleagues, Hairer uses an 
approach “modeled on mathematical properties of ‘wavelets’,” which are used to 
encode information in JPEG and MP3 files. It is no surprise that Hairer is also the 
creator of an award-winning sound-editing program used by DJs, music producers, 
and gaming companies across the globe. His interviews reveal how he has always 
let music enter his profession and vice versa. The transdisciplinary creativity in 
Hairer’s case is clear and plays a critical role in his professional and personal life. 
In fact, there are no boundaries between personal and professional lives for Hairer. 
This, according to him, stems from a “genuine curiosity” about problems, which is 
why he cannot leave math at work and “carries” it around with him wherever he 
goes. He explained:
I think it is important to do genuinely curiosity-driven type of mathematics…It’s only by 
being genuinely curious about a problem, genuinely interested in a problem, that you would 
be able to keep it in your head for sufficiently long time, or sort of think about it in a…
focused way…to make some real progress. (Wolchover, 2014)
Artur Avila  This “Brazilian wunderkind” and “globe-trotting dual citizen” of 
France and Brazil dislikes complications and wishes to “calm things” down by sim-
plifying them. He once declined an honorarium just to avoid the mental stress that 
is required to go over the complicated paperwork. He is afraid of the chaotic traffic 
in Paris and fears that he will drift into thinking about mathematics while driving.
Although he prefers peace to chaos, he does not run away from chaos; he tries to 
simplify it. This calming attitude, along with the search for beauty akin to Bhargava 
and Mirzakhani, is evident in his interviews. However, unlike Mirzakhani, his calm 
Back to the Fields Medal Winners

88
attitude does not mean that he is “slow” in pace. While Mirzakhani considered herself 
slow in approach and preferred solo activities in her free time, Avila is fast in approach, 
loves working with others, and travels the world in search of “attractive” problems.
Avila’s attitude of finding calm in a chaotic world seeps in his profession as well. 
Concerning the search of attractive problems, Avila explained that “Sometimes beauty 
is found in the mathematical statement and sometimes in the use of mathematical 
tools…When they mix together in an unexpected way, then it is something that I want 
to be working on.” He is not the only one who identifies his search of attractive or 
beautiful yet complicated problems. His colleagues also agree that he can easily demys-
tify complicated ideas and make them look simple. His colleagues reported that work-
ing with him has changed their perception of mathematics (Lin & Klarreich, 2014).
Where most mathematicians connect to previous research to find solutions, Avila 
prefers talking to other people. He quickly visualizes mathematical problems and 
proposes solutions that most people need time to understand. He wants to help peo-
ple and solve problems. According to his colleagues, he treats his mathematical 
genius as a hammer and looks for nails of problems to hammer. Mikhail Lyubich, 
professor of mathematics at Stony Brook, explained that:
Part of Avila’s strength is that he is capable of working in all these different areas and, in a 
sense, unifying them…He selects an area that looks interesting, finds the right fundamental 
problem to work on, then goes after it and is basically unstoppable. (Lin & Klarreich, 2014)
Several examples in these interviews suggested that Avila has a very different 
approach to looking at simplifying complex mathematical problems. This ties back 
to Manjul Bhargava’s concept of search for truth and beauty. Like Bhargava, 
Mirzakhani, and Hairer, Avila also prefers to approach mathematical problems from 
a different perspective. In Avila’s case, however, this perspective is driven by his 
general perspective toward life: the drive to calm chaos.
Three Themes: Personal Pursuits, Aesthetics, and Styles
So, what’s common to these uncommonly impressive and creative mathematicians? 
As we look across their individual profiles and interviews, three things stand out. 
First is the manner in which each of these individuals saw mathematics everywhere. 
They did not define boundaries between their professional and personal lives or 
subject matters. Math is always a part of their lives and often shaped and influenced 
by their personal creative interests. From playing musical instruments to baking 
cookies, to doodling like a child to playing with water on a beach, mathematics con-
nects with everything else. These avocations emphasize the transdisciplinary nature 
of creativity we have emphasized earlier. In other words, “Creativity is not some-
thing that can be put into a box or pulled out only in specific moments when creative 
thinking is needed” (Henriksen, 2011, p. 149). It is an “ongoing mindset” that is 
fostered by “openness to new ideas and willingness to try new things” (Henriksen, 
2011, p.  149). These individuals often find it difficult to “turn off” their 
10  Creativity in Mathematics and Beyond

mathematical mindset, even when they are not at work. They saw their interests, 
hobbies, or avocations as influencing and enriching their thinking within their pro-
fessional disciplines.
Second, it is interesting to see the importance of the aesthetic in how each of 
these individuals approached their work. This was most evident in their use of words 
such as “a search for beauty” or “truth” in describing what they did. Fueled by aes-
thetic experiences, Bhargava and Avila searched for truth, beauty, calm, and peace 
through their work, while Mirzakhani and Hairer were driven by wonder. The 
importance of the aesthetic made them all obsess over problems and solutions.
Third, this interplay between the personal and professional led to the development of 
unique personal styles in their approach to mathematics. Each mathematician here has a 
personal relationship to the domain, often shaped by their background, personal avoca-
tions, and their way of looking at the world, which in turn defined their identity as a math-
ematician. Their creative mindsets persist in their lives and everyday work. This informs 
how they see the world and applies in their approach to mathematics and to other facets of 
life. It then becomes easier to see how things connect—to draw them out in large scale 
doodles or to hear them in music—and see them in equations in their own unique ways.
In addition, these profiles point to the value of Csikszentmihalyi’s framework 
where the individual, the domain, and the field each work together to define the 
creative act. The individual (each of these mathematicians) imbibes the contours of 
the domain even while they seek to transform it. The field (their peers) negotiates 
and demands high-quality work as defined by the domain, which in itself is trans-
formed by the work of these individuals. We believe that the personal creative avo-
cations and aesthetic aspirations drive creative mathematicians like Bhargava, 
Mirzakhani, Hairer, and Avila to a level where they excel creatively as individuals, 
as does their field and the domain they work in. These examples illustrate 
Csikszentmihalyi’s (1996) assertion that creativity is where the individual, the 
domain, and the field operate in harmony.
Consequences for Teaching and Learning Mathematics
The view of mathematics described in the profiles of these four top-tier mathemati-
cians differs greatly from the manner in which mathematics is taught in schools 
today. Mathematics today is akin to the drudgery of a forced march through enemy 
territory, brutal and slow, squeezing out any pleasure in the process (Brown, Brown, 
& Bibby, 2008; Eshun, 2004). There is little space for fun and personal connections 
(Aiken, 1979; Eshun, 2004) or for seeing oneself as being a mathematician outside of 
the pages of the textbook, let alone for a sense of wonder or personal style. Students 
rarely if ever see themselves in the mathematics they are taught and rarely, if ever, get 
a sense of the domain (Lave, 1988). In this context, the teacher becomes an important 
mediator between the domain and the gatekeeping functions played by the field. Of 
course, this view of learning in mathematics is an “artistic” way of approaching the 
domain, but as our profiles have indicated, it is consistent with how some of the best

mathematicians in the field work. These profiles tell us that success in mathematics 
comes with passion and play and from seeking connections across fields and disci-
plines. They provide a very different view of mathematics—as a living, artistic, 
organic structure that mathematicians actively construct to find truth and beauty in 
the world. We believe that this view of mathematics has significant implications for 
how we think of teaching and learning in this domain. It offers a novel and humanistic 
way of thinking about how to engage educators and learners in mathematical ideas.

Introduction
As we seek to better understand the nature of creativity and the creative process, we 
must look at the context within which creative activities occur. It is clear that certain 
contexts and architectures (and we use the word “architectures” loosely to include 
both the physical aspects of the world as well as the structural and conceptual aspects) 
are more conducive to creativity than others. Thus, it becomes important to study and 
better understand the nature of spaces (be they real, virtual, or conceptual) and the 
manner in which people engage and interact with each other and with the creative 
process in these spaces. In this chapter, we focus on one aspect of this process, that of 
learning to listen to users of a pattern or design. Users rarely, if ever, quietly acquiesce 
to engaging with the world as we (designers or creators of spaces) think fit. They ques-
tion, tweak, and subvert existing designs. This, then, can become a source of creative 
ideas since. This suggests that not only do ideas not pop up ab initio from the minds 
of designers or creative individuals (see Chaps. 6 and 7 for a detailed examination of 
this perspective) but also can be developed by learning to listen and observe how

actual people use, redesign, and repurpose existing designs to meet their own goals 
and purposes. We frame this issue of discovering creative opportunity through listen-
ing by describing the use of educational technology in a graduate-level classroom.
Educational Technology
Educational technologists (and we include ourselves among them) often see them-
selves as intrepid explorers, envisioning new frameworks and approaches and 
designing new learning spaces guided by the intelligent application of new tech-
nologies—technologies that are fundamentally different from what has come 
before. They often question the judgment of teachers and students who resist their 
ideas, question their motives, and dispute their decisions. They are also sometimes 
scornful of people who seek to do things “their way” rather than in ways that we 
argue are required by these new technological possibilities. In Chap. 2 of this book, 
we argued that this emphasis on the “new” is a form of “chrono-centrism,” i.e., the 
idea that “one’s own era or time in history is the most important or the only one that 
matters.” Our field sometimes asserts that since our world is on the cusp of signifi-
cant changes driven by twin forces of technological change and globalization, we 
need to continually revamp and rethink our current practices.
Given the chance to introduce new technologies in classrooms or other learning con-
texts, designers of learning environments often ignore what their users are telling them. 
More importantly they may ignore what users actually do—how they think, work, learn, 
or behave. We suggest that undervaluing our users may be to our own detriment as schol-
ars and designers, neglecting as it does the kinds of knowledge and real-world experience 
that “naïve users” (if we may characterize them as such) bring to the process and product 
of design. This gives short shrift to what has gone before, ignoring historical context, 
collective and collected knowledge, and the rich experience of past and current users.
This tension between top-down expert design and more organic user-driven 
design processes (that sometimes even subvert the intentions of the designer) is not 
unique to educational technology. It is a theme that has played out over and over 
again in other design professions, architecture being a good example. In the sections 
below, we will provide two contrasting approaches toward designing physical 
spaces and how this can inform and apply to the design of learning spaces.
We argue that observing and understanding how educators and learners construct 
their own, “naturally built,” learning spaces when provided the opportunity to do so is 
something we should embrace. Users who question and subvert existing designs, and 
recreate them to reflect their own practices, can be a powerful impetus for creativity.
Understanding the Lived Experience: The Case of Brasilia
A classic example of a top-down approach and its concomitant failure is the story of the design 
of the city of Brasilia, where the needs of the users were not factored into the design process.
11  A Room of Their Own

95
Brasilia was one of the first cities to be designed completely from the top down. 
As its architect Oscar Niemeyer said back in the 1950s, Brasilia was designed to be 
an ideal city—its design derived from an elegant modernistic aesthetic. Niemeyer 
wanted to bring breath and life to the barren heartland of Brazil, and within a few 
years, Brasilia became the federal capital of the country. However successful and, in 
the words of architect Norman Foster, “hauntingly beautiful” (Bannerji, 2012) it 
may be, Brasilia, as it turns out, was not a living space. It was built around an 
abstract plan intended to resemble an aircraft with the city divided into sectors (one 
for banking, another for hotels, and so on) connected by large avenues.
The problem was that Brasilia ignored the complex (and often messy realities) of 
how people live. As Ricky Burdett, Professor of Urban Studies at the London School 
of Economics, described, Brasilia “doesn’t have the ingredients of a city: messy 
streets, people living above shops, and offices nearby" (in Bannerji, 2012). For 
example, it has no sidewalks, meaning that the streets of Brasilia discourage human 
interaction, leaving the city with no street life. This made Brasilia a dead city where 
people came in to work then left at the first opportunity they had to do so. In fact, 
week after week, Brasilia’s inhabitants would temporarily flee its boundaries, seek-
ing the more human hustle and buzz of surrounding neighborhoods.
Interestingly, the areas surrounding Brasilia, spaces that were designed by “real people,” 
had a completely different “lived-in” feel. As Burdett said, “All you have to do is to go out 
of central Brasilia and you get completely normal plazas and streets with kids playing, and 
places open every hour of the day and night, selling food and illegal alcohol and everything 
else” (in Bannerji, 2012). Clearly, Niemeyer’s top-down beautiful design failed because it 
did not consider the organic interactions between the living space and its inhabitants.
Christopher Alexander and a New View of Architecture
Architect and scholar Christopher Alexander was strong critic of this top-down approach. 
He believed that most post-World War II architecture had “virtually no ability” to create 
“living structures in the world” (Alexander, 1996). In contrast, Alexander offered a very dif-
ferent vision—a vision of architecture that emerges from the lived experiences of people.
Christopher Alexander is an Austrian architect who has designed over 200 build-
ings that adhere to his idea of “living environments.” Alexander was also a prolific 
advocate of his own approach and wrote about his design philosophy and theories, 
most famously in his book A Pattern Language (Alexander, Ishikawa, & Silverstein, 
1977). In this book, Alexander suggested an organic, rather than constructed, 
approach to building spaces. He claimed that architectural creativity emerged 
through a deep understanding of the naturally occurring interactions that exist 
between the inhabitants of an environment, as contextualized within its topography, 
culture, and society. By explaining these patterns, Alexander seeks to empower users 
and inhabitants of a living space to develop, change, and shape their own environ-
ments around the pre-existing organic interactions in that space. Therefore, he argued 
that instead of allowing architects to impose a structure on a living environment and 
Christopher Alexander and a New View of Architecture

96
having that structure shape interactions, the natural interactions within the living 
environments ought to shape its architectural structure. As such, Alexander sug-
gested that an environment is best shaped by those native to that environment.
From Urban Architecture to High-Tech Learning Spaces
The power of Alexander’s idea goes beyond the architecture of cities and can apply 
to other contexts as well. We describe below a higher education classroom where 
users (i.e., teachers and learners) reconfigured the learning space in a technology-­
rich classroom in ways that made sense to them.
The advent of a new hybrid doctoral program at Michigan State University 
prompted the design of a new and unique kind of classroom geared toward various 
modes of technology-mediated learning. It was purposefully design for synchro-
nous hybrid learning in graduate-level seminars. This type of learning occurs syn-
chronously, often through videoconferencing, with both face-to-face and online 
students and instructors. In other words, some of the students are physically present 
in the room with the course instructor, while the rest are located elsewhere (either in 
a separate face-to-face group or distributed individually across multiple locations).
From the very beginning, this was to be a high-tech space that would allow students 
and instructors, both near and far, to work and learn together. The room had two large 
screens that could be used to project video of the participants at a distance or to share 
a computer screen. There were cameras around the room, some of which could be 
controlled by students at a distance using a web-based interface. The chairs in the room 
were unusual too: they were mobile and equipped with iPads that could be used by 
participants for videoconferencing. The idea was that individual students in class could 
see and interact with the students who were “beaming in” remotely and vice versa.
As it turns out, despite the best intentions of the classroom designers, they could not 
predict how users would actually be using these spaces. Moreover, the design of the space 
reflected one form of pedagogical interaction, while the users had many more in mind.
In the next section, we will show three different instantiations of the same learn-
ing space, as determined by the needs of the instructors, their students, and the 
unique content of three hybrid doctoral courses. The three course models that follow 
arose organically as users (teachers and learners) creatively navigated the emergent 
tensions of designing learning spaces in an unfamiliar hybrid context.
Three Models of User-Driven Learning Space Design
Though the pedagogical spaces (both online and face-to-face) had been designed by 
experienced instructors with the best of intentions, the users of the space did not 
necessarily find these spaces easy to use. They took ownership over the space and, 
11  A Room of Their Own

97
through flexibility, creativity, and ingenuity, came up with solutions that best fit 
their learning and teaching goals and purposes.
Model I, Shared Portal
The first model, which we call the shared portal, emerged in a doctoral seminar. 
Weekly readings and activities were assigned to guide explorations of concepts and 
ideas of the course. The students in the course engaged in individual and small group 
projects and discussions which were entry points into larger discussions on how peo-
ple experience, record, reflect upon, and synthesize complex domain knowledge.
The distinctive challenge of this class was that half the students were physically 
present in the classroom with the instructors, while the rest were spread out individu-
ally across multiple locations. The instructors viewed these whole class discussions as 
central interaction points for the perspectives, opinions, and insights of both the stu-
dents and themselves. Moreover, the instructors wished to support active interaction 
and engagement between both kinds of students (those who were physically present 
as well as those online). That meant using online mediation for all interactions.
Interestingly, the idea of using the iPads on the students’ chairs was dropped 
almost immediately, as was the idea of having multiple classroom cameras that 
could be controlled by students. Both of these solutions, though seemingly feasible, 
were found to be too complicated for a range of reasons. Each student (whether face-
to-face or online) had to keep track of too many video streams, increasing the prob-
ability of dropped video as all these streams stretched the capacity of the Internet 
bandwidth to its limits. Multiple audio streams also proved chaotic in practice with 
multiple feedback loops adding to the ambient noise, and valuable classroom time 
was spent in identifying individuals who had kept their audio unmuted when they 
needed to be muted. Even in cases where the audio was used correctly, individuals 
often forgot to unmute their audio while speaking leading to general confusion.
So, despite the availability of all these technologies, the class reverted back to a 
more standard mode of operation, relying on just one single camera, perched high 
over a SMART board to give remote students a wide-scope view of the classroom. 
The problem with this solution was that this wide-angle view of the class prevented 
the remote students from seeing the face-to-face participants in a more personal and 
individual way. In contrast, the remote students joining in via the use of videocon-
ferencing software could be seen quite clearly on the SMART board since each of 
them used a webcam directly focused on their faces. The remote students were 
completely missing out on the rich nonverbal interactions that occur in face-to-face 
interaction—facial expressions, gestures, eye-level contact, and so on.
This classroom structure and interactions are represented in Fig. 11.1. Figure 11.1 
demonstrates a classroom space where some participants are together face-to-face 
and connected to other individuals located remotely. The groups shared one point of 
contact, namely, the video stream out of the classroom to the remote students and 
from the remote students into the classroom SMART board.
As the teachers and learners began to rework the learning space for their needs, 
things in the classroom were repurposed toward new use. A crucial insight was the 
addition of a mobile classroom camera at the eye level of the students in the classroom. 
Three Models of User-Driven Learning Space Design

98
This camera was jerry-rigged together and consisted of an iPad with videoconferenc-
ing software mounted on a cheap tripod. The improvised contraption (dubbed the 
“TriPad”) could be moved from person to person anytime someone in the room was 
speaking (somewhat like a microphone being shared with multiple speakers). Because 
it was close to the participants, this little iPad video stream gave the remote students a 
close-up view of the speaker, offering the nuances of body language, nonverbal sig-
nals, and all. In a room with myriad technology (each chair was equipped with an 
iPad), it was this small creative solution that made a world of difference. It gave new 
dimension to the interactions—they were dynamic, personal, and access orientated.
For small group discussions, a standard solution might be to tell students exactly 
which online platform they should use. However, the instructors purposefully left 
the technology choice open so that students could negotiate this toward their group’s 
needs. A consequence of this decision was that most of the students did not use the 
tools that had been designed into the space (the iPads on the chairs, etc.), instead 
exploring various tools to find what best worked for them. For example, one group 
chose to work on Skype for a personal discussion of the week’s readings but kept 
their video off so that discussion of the text itself was the main focus. Other groups 
used a variety of technological tools simultaneously (Google Hangouts + Etherpad, 
etc.), while still others made a point of using a different interactive space each class 
session, perhaps to better experience the affordances and constraints of each.
It is important to note that many of the affordances of the designed space were not used at 
all; if they were often used in ways that were not intended by the original classroom designers.
Model II, Personal Portals
The second model, which we call personal portals, was an even clearer reflection of 
modern technological and educational trends where there is a predominance of 
remote learners. The class was composed of two instructors, seven face-to-face and 
twice as many (15) remote students. As a hybrid setting with an uneven balance of

99
students, there was less of a demand for physical space (a technology equipped 
classroom) than there was for online space. Moreover, the instructors wanted the 
students’ small group discussions to be the primary interaction points for learning. 
Any whole class discussions were kept to brief overviews and announcements from 
the instructors. Thus, the situation required a combination of online platforms for 
audio/visual conferencing and a combination of devices for remote students. The 
result involved remote students using two devices simultaneously: a laptop or desk-
top computer for small group interactions on Google Hangouts and an iPad, running 
Skype or some other chat program, for whole class segments.
From an instructional design perspective, we might think of the whole class dis-
cussions as a kind of central “piazza” around which smaller transactions (individual 
and small group projects and activities) are interspersed. To facilitate this in a tradi-
tional face-to-face setting, students would move to the physical edges of the larger 
classroom space to allow smaller personal interactions. But making a place for 
smaller scale interactions in this hybrid/online course meant moving to a different 
online space while staying in contact with the whole class space. This arrangement 
can be visually represented as a classroom space with dotted lines representing 
multiple connections between that space and the remote students (see Fig. 11.2). 
Again, this structure utilized the designed space in ways that were not anticipated. 
The remote-controlled cameras that were part of the original high-tech vision for 
the classroom were never used. However, the chairs with the iPads became an 
important affordance because they allowed small groups to work together as the 
remote students were “beamed in” to the iPad screens. Classroom interaction thus 
became a combination of one large screen showing the entire class and the students 
in remote locations and, when needed, the iPads as an additional resource.
Model III, Linked Classrooms
The third model, linked classrooms, featured a single instructor who taught two dif-
ferent groups of students that were equally spread between two separate locations 
on different campuses and linked through a single online conferencing platform (see 
Fig. 11.3). The instructor had never taught two separate groups split between two 
physical spaces on two different campuses.
While this unique course split (necessitated by logistics) was new to him, the 
instructor quickly identified the presence of a single space that could be used to the 
class’ advantage, i.e., the virtual bridge afforded by online interaction. The confer-
encing platform (an early version of Zoom) allowed for up to six participants to share 
their webcams simultaneously. These webcam streams appear as small frames within 
the conferencing platform, showing whoever has shared their camera with the rest of 
the class. Realizing the group-to-group format used only two of his six possible 
frames, the instructor decided to add the “TriPad” innovation (the mobile in-class 
iPad camera mentioned in the first model) to his classroom. This was an important 
technological pedagogical move. The instructor had realized that the frames in the 
online conferencing platform were his to fill as he thought necessary for the course. 
As a result, he began to add a series of guest lecturers from a host of different geo-
graphic locations, greatly expanding the scope of the content, the discussion, and the

learning and opening the two face-to-face locations to a broader spectrum of profes-
sional community interactions and perspectives.
On Learning from Users
As we look across these three examples, one thing stands clear: the meaning of the 
space, the classroom, emerged as much from the plans of the designers as from the 
practices of the users of that space. Winston Churchill famously said, “We shape our 
buildings; thereafter they shape us.” However, our experience in some sense was the

101
opposite. The architecture of the space did not determine user behavior, but rather 
user behavior determined the architecture of the space.
The tools we use may be new, and the spaces we function in may be ones that 
never existed before. Yet we suggest that there is still a lot that can be learned from 
thinkers and scholars who have thought deeply about how we engage and interact 
with each other. In addition, our users are an important part of the process. By 
engaging with them, knowing their goals and desires, and, most importantly, under-
standing their practices, we can create vibrant intellectual spaces that allow for 
engaging learning. The urge to interact on multiple levels is a powerful and organic 
human impulse. It finds ways of expressing itself, often without the aid of an over-
arching vision or top-down design.
Alexander suggests that the only way to design “lived spaces” is to either have 
the inhabitants of the living space inform the design right from the beginning or to 
have the architects of the space closely observe the organic interactions of inhabit-
ants and then engage in the design process. This facilitates a natural and usable 
design trajectory—one that is aesthetically “whole” in the way that it is seamlessly 
tied to its context (Mishra & Koehler, 2008).
A similar pattern could be seen with all of the instructors of the three courses we 
described here. Some instructors chose to let the “inhabitants” (students) choose 
and negotiate the tools and designs for small group interactions. Other instructors 
closely observed the organic, proven interactions that occur naturally in learning 
environments and structured the collective spaces and technology supports around 
those interactions. In each of these cases, however, the original, deeply thought-out, 
well-intentioned, top-down plans of the original designers of the space were ignored 
or subverted in multiple ways. Some elements that were considered important by 
the designers (such as the controllable cameras) were never used. Other elements 
(the iPads on the mobile chairs) were used by some groups, but not by others. And 
finally, many elements emerged organically as the instructors and students engaged 
in the act of teaching and learning (such as the TriPad). In each case, however, 
Alexander’s dictum of observing users, learning from them, and incorporating their 
natural interactions consistently holds true.
In this paradigm, the task of the architects of learning spaces involves listening 
and facilitating the design rather than dictating or forcing it. Creative and contextual 
approaches to designing learning environments acknowledge the power of episte-
mologies and perspectives that lie in existing knowledge. Repurposing these ideas 
requires knowledge and awareness of this knowledge but also requires designers to 
make basic human interactions the cornerstone of any final design.
Experts in educational technology may have designs in mind for where and how 
interactions ought to take place, but such designs are essentially a plan, or an initial 
vision—a model created by an expert, not the audience or the users. Often, designs are 
not synonymous with the reality of everyday life, learning, or common interactions. 
And in such cases (as in the earlier example of the city of Brasilia), reality has a way 
of intruding to either alter or reject the design, no matter how elegant or desirable it 
may have appeared at the beginning.
On Learning from Users

102
In order to function best, designs must be created flexibly, with sensitivity and 
attention to context. The experiences of real-world interactions and the needs of 
real-time, real-life users must seamlessly become a part of learning design. As 
Michael Crichton (1991) famously notes in his book Jurassic Park, “life finds a 
way” (p. 159). If that is indeed the case, maybe the best thing for us as instructional 
designers is to try to understand the deeper patterns of human interaction, to learn 
from scholars and history, and to listen to what users are saying. But most impor-
tantly, to closely observe what they do—and then get out the way. Sometimes, the 
most creative solution may be to step back and do nothing at all.

Introduction
As we move further into the twenty-first century, the need for twenty-first century skills 
such as creativity, flexibility, and independence among tech-savvy learners is ever 
increasing. At the same time new digital, networked technologies offer unparalleled 
opportunities for creative and independent learning (Pink, 2009). Just a few examples of 
the kinds of rich, immediate, and varied knowledge resources that are widely available 
today include instructional videos on YouTube, free access to rigorous university 
courses, and the development of complex personal learning environments. This blend of 
need and opportunity makes for an exciting time in history for educators and students. 
These technologies allow both novices and experts alike to participate in the creation 
and cultivation of their own learning. The opportunity to support creative, independent 
learning though is not often at the forefront of the design of learning experiences and 
environments. And while twenty-first Century Skills are increasingly lauded as

necessary for the future of our society (Robinson, 2011; Wagner, 2010), there has been 
little practical support for educators to guide the design of these types of environments.
The complexity of this landscape means that students must become skillful, 
independent, and creative learners (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2004). 
They need to be able to successfully navigate these opportunities by seeking, ana-
lyzing, integrating, and redefining what they know. The world we live in is more 
complex, globally integrated, and information-rich than ever. Successful thinkers 
must be able to manage this complexity, think divergently and creatively, solve 
problems with innovative solutions, and network in a diverse global environment 
(Florida, 2002; Pink, 2005). Learners must be able to see connections and synthe-
size information both within a body of knowledge and across disciplines (Freedman, 
2007). These skills are hallmarks of a creative mind, and they take discipline-
breaking and divergent thinking into the realm of the real world (Mishra, Koehler, 
& Henriksen, 2011; Root-Bernstein, 1996; Root-Bernstein, 2003; Root-Bernstein 
& Bernstein, 1999).
Learning environments are highly influential on creative processes and many 
educational psychologists and researchers have suggested that environments have 
the power to make or break the creative potential of students (Amabile, 1996; 
Giroux & Schmidt, 2004; Robinson, 2003). A learning environment designed to 
support creativity offers opportunities for divergent thinking and innovative solu-
tions with an overall atmosphere that fosters communication, collaboration, and 
risk-taking (Chan & Yuen, 2014). In this type of environment, learning is deep and 
learners are connected to each other and to the content in rich and meaningful 
ways.
Creativity from an Indisciplinary Approach
As educational institutions have identified creative thinking as integral for future suc-
cess (Jerald, 2009), providing creative outlets and opportunities for students has 
increasingly become an important goal. Research shows that an emphasis on teaching 
discrete or disconnected creative thinking skills may not be useful. Rather, creativity 
requires a “deep knowledge of the discipline that creative work emerges within” as 
well as that thinking that spans disciplines (Caper, 1996). This “indisciplinary” or 
dual-nature approach better represents how creativity actually works. This has been 
described in greater detail in Chap. 5 and exemplified in case stories of creative indi-
viduals in Chaps. 8, 9, and 10, in this book. Instead of trying to explicitly teach cre-
ativity, the learning environment itself must be designed to support creative thinking.
Students in school do not usually have the opportunity, or even the frame of ref-
erence, to navigate complex exploration or creative thinking (Cropley, 2003). Thus, 
the design of learning environments and experiences for students are highly influ-
enced by broader contextual factors such as tradition, national requirements, 
accountability, teacher evaluations, and high-stakes testing. All in all, these influ-
ences limit the kinds of opportunities students have to dive deeply into disciplinary 
12  The Architecture of Creative Learning Environments

105
(or (in) disciplinary) content and to pursue their inherent interests. The prospects for 
detailed exploration or curiosity are also restricted by tight schedules and the 
demands of assessment. Furthermore, as students build knowledge, they have few 
chances to make connections between disciplines due to the bounded designs of 
academic tasks and institutions. Therefore, most experiences in school are isolated 
to disconnected areas of study, preventing students from looking over the walls of 
different disciplines to develop personalized, creative connections (Giroux & 
Schmidt, 2004). Such limitations, shaped by the demands of rigid educational pol-
icy and school structure (Fusarelli, 2004), directly influence the physical and con-
ceptual design of the learning environment.
To intentionally design possibilities for innovation and creativity we must go 
beyond benchmark achievements to include creative habits of mind. The opportu-
nity and ability to intensely engage in a discipline or to think across disciplines 
requires more than a wide but shallow approach to content. It means that learners 
must be pushed to question, apply previous knowledge, and persist down winding 
paths. Establishing patterns, seeing connections, and synthesizing concepts across 
disciplines requires guidance, real-world thinking, and activities that promote cre-
ative thinking in order to fine-tune independent learning skills. Therefore, the indis-
ciplined learner must have the opportunity for problem-based learning steeped in 
real-world context and guided practice, with time and collaboration for exploration 
and inquiry. This develops the types of skills, habits, and opportunities that support 
the creative process and innovative thinking.
Identifying Architectures That Support Creativity
The development of creative thinkers not only depends on the opportunities they have 
but on the intentional design of learning environments that support their creativity in 
multiple ways. But, it is not always clear how teachers and environments can best sup-
port creativity. This is because creativity can be seen as an elusive concept that is hard to 
define and therefore hard to teach or nurture. This, in turn, raises a range of pragmatic 
and theoretical questions, specifically about how educators can plan for and design these 
types of experiences and environments. How can educators support twenty-first Century 
Skills in an era where high-stakes testing and standardized curricula are still the norm?
The SCALE (support for creativity in a learning environment) was designed to 
offer educators a practical tool to aid in the design of learning environments to support 
creativity. It is briefly described here as one example of the type of work that can result 
from the collaboration of researchers and practitioners to impact classrooms and sup-
port educational change. (For a lengthier discussion on the development of the SCALE 
and a usable version of the instrument see Richardson & Mishra, unpublished manu-
script.) The SCALE was created based on an extensive literature review, classroom 
observations, and administrator/educator/researcher collaborative design and consists 
of 14 items in three categories that were identified as foundational to the support of 
student creativity: learner engagement, physical environment, and learning climate.
Identifying Architectures That Support Creativity

106
Learner engagement refers to the tasks that students are involved in. This section of 
the SCALE consists of six sub items that range from describing the types of tasks that 
students should be involved in to the types of structures teachers can put in place to sup-
port open and flexible learning experiences. It is important that students are involved in 
tasks that are open-ended or involve choice (Eckhoff, 2011). It is also essential that 
learning is an interdisciplinary experience with students able to take on multiple per-
spectives and learn problem finding and solving skills (Peppler & Solomou, 2011). 
Deep learning and time for reflection becomes an important element as well, as students 
engage in experiences that ask them to be complex thinkers, experimenters, and creators 
(Sawyer, 2015).
The learning climate or atmosphere should be one that supports risk taking and 
mistake making (Olivant, 2015). Students should feel that they are a part of a commu-
nity of learners who care for each other and value differing opinions, skills, ideas, and 
experiences. In this climate, the teacher’s role is one of facilitator, co-­learner, and co-
explorer (Cress & Holm, 2016). The collaborative climate of the classroom is central 
to the daily routine as much time is given for discussion and idea development.
Finally, the physical environment itself must be set up for the support of deep 
learning and creative thinking. This includes having a variety of rich resources, 
both analog and digital, that are easily accessible to students. It is a space that 
allows for a variety of configurations so that multiple areas can be created to sup-
port different types of thinking and creating (Forrester & Hui, 2007; Warner & 
Myers, 2009).
The intentional design of learning environments to support creativity provides 
students and teachers an opportunity to move toward a context in which students are 
self-directed and able to navigate through complex content, create their own con-
nections, and become the independent, twenty-first century thinkers that our society 
needs. This self-directedness is an essential outcome of schooling and is increas-
ingly more a viable option for educators who have access to rich technology tools.
Creativity and indisciplined learning requires balancing the forces of order and 
chaos. Learning environments need to provide students a flexible structure within 
which students can experiment, collaborate, and problem solve. These are contexts 
that allow students to learn from both success and failure. Such open-ended envi-
ronments, however, can be challenging to learners as well. They can appear chaotic 
and offer little guidance to students on how to navigate them. Clearly, well devel-
oped self-regulation by the student can help them become better learners—particu-
larly in such open-ended technology-rich contexts.
Conclusion
So, how do institutions and designers develop environments that support deep, cre-
ative, and self-directed learning? Most current research focuses on internal charac-
teristics of self-directed learners. Gradually, we are beginning to understand that 
12  The Architecture of Creative Learning Environments

107
external factors have an impact as well. The SCALE is one attempt at providing 
educators practical guidance on how those external factors can be designed with 
explicit goals to support new types of learning experiences. Guglielmino (1977) 
noted that certain learning contexts are more effective at promoting self-directed 
learning. Learning environments that use technology in meaningful ways may have 
an important impact on self-directed learning as they connect students to resources 
in ways that were not previously available (Candy, 2004).
The SCALE shows that designed elements of the learning environment can influ-
ence the way that students learn and engage in twenty-first century skills. Educational 
stakeholders who seek to encourage self-directed, creativity-supporting learning in 
contemporary learning environments should consider factors such as the alignment 
of technology to learning goals, transdisciplinary learning experiences, real-world 
or problem-based learning, a reevaluation of school structures (length of periods, 
team structure, etc.), and giving students flexible opportunities for learning 
structures.
Environments that foster and support this type of learning could affect the role of 
the teacher, bringing about new conversations on that role and the resulting desired 
skills. Purposefully designed learning environments can provide opportunities for 
students to explore content in-depth and across disciplines by allowing more time 
for problem or project-based learning and collaboration, pervasive access to tech-
nology and other resources, problem-solving or inquiry-based design, a transdisci-
plinary approach, administrative support, and intensive professional development 
for the teachers. As students learn to independently make meaningful connections 
and foster innovative thinking, such learning environments set them on the path 
toward truly twenty-first century learning environments. As Zimmerman (1990), 
one of the leading scholars and researchers in the area of self-directed learning, said, 
“When students understand that they are creative agents, responsible for and capa-
ble of self-development and self-determination of their goals, their self as an agent 
will provide the motivation necessary for self-regulation” (p. 11).
What is clear is that the development of creativity cannot happen (at the very least can-
not happen easily) in the kind of traditional classroom and disciplinary structures we have 
today. Open-ended, technology-rich learning contexts appear to provide opportunities for 
students to be structured in their ways of thinking, even while they are open to pursuing 
questions of personal interest—the crux of creativity. As educators, we need to understand 
that we are architects and designers of learning environments that allow students to 
develop the kinds of mental discipline required to think outside of the disciplines.

Deep Convergence
Invention is the mother of necessity
~ Thorstein Veblen
Information is not knowledge, knowledge is not wisdom, wisdom is not foresight
~ Arthur C. Clarke
Technology is changing in a rapid rate and as the internet moves into every part 
of our lives, it is increasingly clear that every aspect of our day is deeply entwined 
with digital technologies. What this means for us, as individuals and as a society, is 
difficult to predict. The effects, for the most part, will be slow but cumulative, mak-
ing forecasting difficult, if not impossible to get right. Throughout these chapters we 
have emphasized the connections between technology and creativity as entwined 
issues of importance for the twenty-first century—a point explicitly made in Chap. 
2 and implicitly woven throughout every chapter. In this chapter we will cast a 
wider look at this relationship acknowledging the inherent unpredictability of this 
process. Would anybody, for instance, a hundred or so years ago, seeing the creation 
of the first automobiles, predict that this technology would lead to urban sprawl and 
traffic jams, to wars in the Middle East for oil and drive-through movie theaters? 
That said, it is worthwhile reflecting a bit on these possibilities, all the while being 
humble in our prognostications, because as we know from history, forecasting 
around such complex constructs as technology or creativity often overestimates 
short-term effects and underestimates long-term ones. We panic in the immediate 
term about concerns such as, “Is Google making us stupid?” but fail to see that 
Google affords us access to vast stores of information which might improve human 
information processing skills over time; or miss the real possibilities that, while it

may not make us “stupid,” the ways that Google breaks down our privacy boundar-
ies could have long-term effects on human societal values.
A term that comes up quite a bit when we speak of new technologies is conver-
gence, referring to the integration of what were previously discrete and indepen-
dently used technologies and services. Some of it is visible to us (such as the 
availability of maps and apps on our smartphones) and others more invisible, such 
as the manner in which these apps can interact with each other in the background to 
offer more comprehensive services (such as links to local dining establishments 
when using the interactive map on your phone). This convergence is driven by the 
ubiquitous reach of the internet and the fact that we can now access it through a 
range of devices and platforms.
If we look up the word convergence in the dictionary we get a range of meanings. 
Some are funny yet relatively useless, for instance one that says convergence is “the 
act, condition, quality, or fact of converging.” More interesting, and less circular, are 
how the word gets used in other contexts. For instance, in biology, convergent evolu-
tion means the adaptive evolution of superficially similar structures, such as wings in 
birds and insects. In mathematics, convergence is the property of approaching a limit. 
Or as a friend once said, convergence is the way in which infinities can be controlled, 
captured, and understood. In physiology—and this was something that came up 
when researching this piece—it is the coordinated turning of the eyes inward to focus 
on an object at close range (what in other words we would call being cross-eyed). 
And finally, convergence is a meeting place, a site where things come together.
Though digital convergence is often used to indicate the last of these definitions 
where things come together, the other meanings still prevail, making the idea of 
convergence both slippery and richer. This is a good thing, because dictionary defi-
nitions can sometimes be straitjackets, and digital convergence is different things to 
different people.
These different meanings of the term play out in different ways when we speak 
of digital convergence. There are shades of the biological idea of convergence, 
where different media and technologies develop similar features (your cell phone 
includes a camera while your camera may double up as a streaming media player). 
The mathematical idea of convergence, in the sense of a series of events adding up 
to a finite, manageable whole, highlights the manner in which this current talk of 
digital convergence is just the current consequence of media and knowledge coming 
together, which began thousands of years ago when people scribbled on cave walls. 
And of course, while the physiological definition reminds us that despite the won-
ders of technology, we need to focus our eyes inward, to reflect and think about the 
meanings and consequences of technological marvels.
What does this idea of digital convergence mean for us as learners and educa-
tors? What does it mean for us as creative individuals or a creative society? As must 
be clear, in this book we seek to locate our discussion at the intersection of these 
three key ideas, technology, creativity, and education. Thus, we would like to speak 
about three different kinds of convergence which relate to all three constructs and 
their intersection. The first is the technical idea of digital convergence, the second is 
an educator’s perspective on pedagogical convergence, and finally, looking at the 
bigger picture, we discuss the idea of deep convergence.
13  Deep Convergence

113
Digital Convergence
People have argued that this new world of ubiquitous and invisible computing 
through small, relatively inexpensive devices that merge media and communica-
tions technologies will reshape the way individuals and organizations collaborate 
and share information. Convergence in this sense of the term includes content and 
application development for film, video games, music, advertising, and mass media; 
distribution, including wireless, broadband, VoIP, and more; hardware, such as cell 
phones, mobile devices, game consoles, and so on.
This digital convergence is often talked of in technological terms (such as a cell 
phone, digital camera, or gaming console). This emphasis on the technical is not 
surprising because there is still a lot of intricate and difficult work (regarding com-
munication standards, interoperability, hardware handshakes, and software bugs) 
that must be configured and deciphered.
At the same time, this emphasis on the technical should not obscure the psycho-
logical, social, and cultural aspects of these technologies. These technologies are 
reshaping the way individuals and organizations collaborate and share information. 
Digital convergence, in an important sense, removes and, maybe more importantly, 
obscures physical and temporal boundaries that in the past served as impediments 
between individuals and the world.
When communication integrates, maps and borders have less meaning, and bar-
riers of distance begin to dissolve. In some ways, these technologies of “action at a 
distance” simplify our lives, since it allows us to connect with the world in ways that 
we might not otherwise. It becomes the center of our social network and constructs 
a “virtual space” within which we live, learn, and work. Of course, there are nega-
tive aspects of this convergence as well, as simply glancing through the comments 
section of a YouTube video, or watching people drive and play on their phones at the 
same time, can so easily demonstrate.
Pedagogical Convergence
Living in the physical and social world—for both work and play—requires acquiring 
knowledge. To survive and thrive in these new social and physical spaces, we need 
to develop new ways of learning that meet the demands of this new era. As we 
described in Chap. 3, any time that we try to develop something new, and effective, 
we are in the realm of creativity. In some sense, this book is an attempt to map out 
what such a framework could look and feel like. The convergence of our strategies 
and theories of learning to live in this digitally integrated world is the second kind of 
convergence we are alluding to—what we call pedagogical convergence. This con-
vergence deals with how our approaches to teaching and learning need to converge 
with the new trends in digital technologies.
Pedagogical Convergence

114
Learning today can no longer be restricted to 12 + 4 years of schooling. Not only 
do we have more to learn, we need to do it more often and in less time. This puts 
severe stress on our existing pedagogical systems including schools, training work-
shops, colleges, and universities. Neither can learning be limited to rote memoriza-
tion of concepts. Learning today needs to be continuous, just in time, and 
perpetual.
Clearly digitally convergent technologies have an important role to play in this 
change (see Kereluik, Mishra, Fahnoe, & Terry, 2013 for a description of what 
knowledge is of most worth as framed within in a broader discussion of teacher 
education). It must be noted, however, that specific technologies do not force one set 
of actions over others. Technologies can be used for traditional learning as easily as 
for newer, flexible pedagogy. The technology does not care. In some sense it may 
even be easier to use technology to achieve “old style” goals. This is why we often 
see the online course that is merely a set of static Web pages—a textbook moved 
onto the Web, or the naïve drill and practice program, cosmetically enhanced by 
irrelevant and pointless flash and fizz. We must remember that all the technologies 
in the world are of no use if they are to push the same old agenda. The language of 
pedagogy needs to rise up to meet the language of convergence.
Given the fast pace of technological change, it can be challenging to move our 
learning theories and pedagogical approaches beyond a perpetual game of catch up. 
This is not to say that we do not have a sense of what this pedagogical convergence 
will look like. The new pedagogical convergence is informed by thinkers such as 
John Dewey who, early in the twentieth century, urged us to base all educational 
strategies on the impulses of the child—the urge to communicate, inquire, con-
struct, and express.
Some of these new understandings are inspired by the technology itself. Games 
and simulations, with their rich multiplayer, immersive, interactive, social worlds, 
could provide some indications to a new way of learning. This is not to say that 
games and simulations are the only way forward. Not at all. Education is a multidi-
mensional beast, and there is space for various genres and ways of doing—as long 
as they are thoughtfully implemented and we resist being seduced by the shiny, sexy 
surfaces of technology. We must instead prepare to peer deeper into their essences.
Deep Convergence
This brings us to the third and final kind of convergence, which, for want of a better 
term, we call deep convergence. Deep convergence is based on the realization that 
one thing that we humans do is construct new understandings of ourselves and the 
world we live in through different media. What these new effects will be is hard to 
imagine. New technologies allow us to imagine new worlds and to create new selves 
in this world. In some sense, this idea of digital convergence is the first step towards 
an unfolding journey that will spark other convergences, many of which we cannot

even imagine at this moment. As we noted right from the start, both creativity and 
technology are unpredictable realms. Their intersection even more so.
As new media have emerged, have creatively played with their capabilities and 
constraints and then used them to develop new ways of expressing themselves. This 
ideology of creativity and expression is marked all over each chapter of this book 
but most particularly in Chap. 4 in which we described how new networking tech-
nologies change the very nature of gatekeeping of the creative process. These new 
expressions are ways of developing a deeper understanding of who we are as indi-
viduals, as groups (such as organizations or nations), or even who we are as a 
species.
This is a different kind of convergence, and it is somewhat difficult to explain. 
Perhaps the only way to do so is through an example. The beginning of the 20th 
century was a time of immense upheaval in our way of understanding our place in 
the world. In the arena of technology, those years saw a range of inventions that 
forever changed the way we lived. These include the airplane, the radio receiver, 
neon signs, air conditioning, the vacuum diode, color photography, motion pictures, 
crossword puzzles, zippers, tommy guns, insulin, and the precursor to what we now 
call television. There were also revolutions in science and art, from relativity theory 
to cubism, from quantum mechanics to surrealism. Within the space of a few years, 
we moved from a worldview where time and space were absolute to a relativistic, 
fractured, unstable one. This change in zeitgeist was reflected in the sciences as well 
as in the arts.
Consider the year 1922. This was the year that Einstein won the Nobel Prize, 
James Joyce published Ulysses, and T.S. Eliot published The Waste Land. This was 
also the year that Picasso designed the sets for a ballet performed by Diaghilev and 
scored by Stravinsky, the debut of which was attended by the likes of James Joyce 
and Proust.
This kind of a creative convergence is larger, deeper, and more fundamental than 
the other convergences we have discussed so far. In some fundamental way, these 
convergences, developed a century ago, still define the world we live in today.
It would be foolhardy on our part to even attempt to make predictions about the 
nature of deep convergence that will emerge from the technological changes hap-
pening around us today, if only because the effects of technology on society, and of 
society on technology are complex and multi-threaded. Simple cause and effect 
relationships are difficult to trace.
Moreover, thinking of such deep convergences can also be risky. At the heart of 
the word convergence is the word “verge” with its connotations of being on the edge 
(as in the leading, or as others say, the bleeding edge). Being on the verge, or at the 
edge, is to be somewhere unstable and unpredictable, and this instability can be 
nerve-wracking. There is also a sense of excitement, mingled with fear, mystery, 
and anticipation. There is a realization that decisions we make today will have rip-
ple effects and consequences, both intended and unintended, far beyond what we 
can imagine.
It is here, at this edge, that human creativity comes to the forefront. It is at this 
edge of new tools and technologies that we can see new possibilities. The changes 
Deep Convergence

116
we are seeing in the world around us today are key to how the future ahead of us will 
unfold. Clearly human creativity, new tools and technologies, and education are the 
key ideas that will be essential as we move forward.

There is no doubt within the field of education that enhanced creativity and intel-
ligent uses of technology are essential for success in today’s society. Despite that 
acknowledgement, the field of education has struggled to successfully integrate 
them appropriately into educational contexts. A key reason for this, we argue, is that 
we often misunderstand both the nature of creativity and the creative process as well 
as the nature of technology and technological progress.
Creativity comes from the Latin root creo with connotations of “bringing into 
being,” “making,” or “giving birth to.” This idea of bringing something new into 
being was a power only available to the gods. Over the years this mystic sense of 
creativity as being a gift of the gods has never really disappeared. It remains visible 
in the idea that creativity is a special, unique talent that appears ab initio, ex nihilo, 
either by the grace of the gods or catching a lucky break in the genetic game of 
chance. What these approaches rarely recognize is the complex nature of creativity, 
as well as the foundational structures (cognitive, social, disciplinary, technologi-
cal) essential to support creative ideas and their dissemination. It is important to 
understand that creativity is not a magical trick or sleight of hand, but rather is the 
product of understandable processes and components. It is the result of factors 
within our grasp and comprehension. In this way, creativity is not just a special 
talent, but rather it is a way of thinking and working which can be learned, enhanced, 
and developed. Of course, that is not to say that it is simple or straightforward—
indeed, we hope that the chapters, topics, and viewpoints in the book have pointed 
to the richness and complexity of the construct. If anything, supporting creativity 

118
in education means that we need to allow for a more complex and richer view of it. 
We must go beyond simply throwing up our hands and assuming it is an undefin-
able, subjective space of “magic” or conversely assuming that it is linear or that it 
always looks and works the same in all contexts. Understanding the common 
threads of creativity is important. So too is allowing for contextual ways that it 
emerges and considering the factors and environments that help it to flourish.
Similarly, we need to go beyond simplistic ideas of technology. The word tech-
nology comes from the Greek (techne) meaning “art” and “craft.” These words offer 
a different picture from conceptions of technology as being the mere mechanical 
application of scientific principles. This art or craft foundation in the root of tech-
nology is different from the tool-centric, mechanistic ways that technology is often 
systemically taught or presented to teachers and learners. Techne is also the root of 
the word technique—so it has further connotations of learning through doing, of 
approaches learned on the job, and of tacit and subtle knowledge—something that 
may not be easily codified and put into language.
As we noted, our attempt to demystify creativity and technology is not to posi-
tion it as a straightforward process. Clearly creative ideas do not emerge from a 
vacuum; they appear through the collision and cross-pollination of ideas (often from 
disparate disciplines or knowledge frameworks) which must be both embedded in a 
field of knowledge or a discipline. Yet at the same time, as we pointed out in an 
earlier chapter, they must also exist in an (in)disciplined as it were. Understanding 
creativity requires us to move fluidly between multiple poles which coexist—
between common threads and diverse realities, between analysis and intuition, 
between divergent and convergent thinking, both within disciplines and between 
them, and between broad systems and local contexts. It is comprehensible and 
accessible but also nuanced and challenging.
There are no magic tricks to becoming creative—rather it is in placing trust in the 
process. And the process involves developing a foundation of knowledge that is 
both grounded in a discipline even while covering a wide intellectual range across 
the landscape of ideas. It means being willing to take the risk of putting them 
together in new ways and sharing them with the world. It is a participatory process, 
in that the creator or creators do a part of the work, and the world does another part. 
The world has the final say on whether a product or idea or artifact is truly regarded 
as being creative, whether it is novel, effective, and whole.
Bringing these new conceptions of creativity and technology to the field of edu-
cation adds another layer to this complex mix. It requires us to go beyond ideas, into 
the pragmatics of actual classrooms, students, teachers, and practices—to the idea of 
technique. The word technique is related to the Latin root texere, meaning to weave 
or to construct. And “weave” as we know it today means to “interlace, especially to 
form a texture or design: to unite in a coherent whole; to move in a devious, winding, 
or zigzag course especially to avoid obstacles” (Merriam-Webster Dictionary).
A similar sort of weaving can be seen in the chapters of this book, threading 
together ideas of creativity, technology, and education, into a rich complex tapestry. 
Each of these topics is, in and of themselves, complex and rich topics that can and 
do have volumes devoted to them. Covering them together, in one book, in one 
Afterword

119
­collection of interconnected chapters, is a challenging task. Clearly there is much 
more to be said and written about these topics and their interrelationships than can 
be covered here. We hope we have provided ideas, perspectives, and examples that 
contribute to the larger discourse.
Of course, the tapestry we have constructed has many holes, with many sections 
yet to be developed and many details yet to be defined. That said, we believe that 
this book, this collection of articles, allows us to provide a broad overarching scaf-
folding of ideas for further exploration, where themes from creativity, technology, 
and education weave their way through each other. This book is thus an act of syn-
thesis, a first draft, as it were, of a much needed discussion of these ideas. Though 
we do not know (and cannot predict) what the final tapestry will look like, we 
believe that over these chapters lay out the broad contours of an emergent design. 
We look forward to how this design grows and develops in the future and are grate-
ful for this opportunity to be part of this process.
