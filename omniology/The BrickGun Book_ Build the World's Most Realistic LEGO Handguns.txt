Warning
Adult supervision is required. These models are not suitable for children under 
the age of 12. 
The MAC-11 shoots rubber bands. When firing the MAC-11, always wear eye 
protection. For maximum safety, carry the MAC-11 unloaded. A replica may fire 
when dropped or hit. 
Be particularly careful when handling these models in public because they 
have been mistaken for real weapons. If you take your LEGO gun out in public, 
add a bright orange tip to the muzzle to show that it’s not the real thing.

Dedication
To Jeff Jezek, wherever you may be, for putting up 
with my only wanting to play with LEGO every time I 
came to your house.
To my mom for buying my first set after Jeff would 
no longer let me come over.
And to Drac for giving me the 8880 Super Car on my 
28th birthday, without which I never would have found 
my way back to the happiness that came when I first 
clicked two bricks together at age 6.
Acknowledgments
This book would not have been possible without the 
fantastic communities on LDraw and LUGNET. James 
Jessiman and Terry Keller deserve special apprecia-
tion, as they made me realize it’s okay to love LEGO 
as an adult.
I’d like to thank everyone at MOCpages. Hearing their 
praise and seeing other people’s fantastic creations 
always pushed me to make mine better.
I’d also like to thank Fark.com. Their “Cool” link to my 
first posted model in 2001 is what started the ball roll-
ing. I now forgive you guys for melting my server.
And lastly, I’d like to thank everyone who supported 
BrickGun with blog posts, emails, and links over the 
years, especially those of you who purchased build-
ing instructions and models. I didn’t set out to do 
anything special, but all of you have made it just that.

Introduction
Welcome to the official BrickGun book! I created 
BrickGun.com’s first ultra-realistic LEGO handgun 
model back in 1999. Since then, I have designed 10 
models, and I’ve learned an amazing amount about 
how to make designs lifelike, accurate, and strong. In 
this guide, you’ll find the history of how I created and 
refined my first model and how I create models today. 
I’ll also show some building techniques to help ensure 
your models are constructed correctly and as sturdily 
as possible, no matter what you’re creating.
But the bulk of what you’ll find is exactly what you 
came for: detailed, step-by-step instructions for five 
of my most popular models. The instructions are in 
full color and easy to follow, just like the ones you 
find in official LEGO sets. Parts lists in both text and 
graphic formats are provided at the start of every 
model, so you’ll know exactly what you need before 
you start building. 
You’ll start with the basics with the BG22. The com-
ponents, build order, and especially the internal 
mechanical functions carry over to the 92FS, Desert 
Eagle, and 1911, so building the BG22 first will lay 
the groundwork for the other models. You’ll get into 
more complex and detailed models with the 92FS 
and the Desert Eagle. Then, you’ll build the 1911, by 
far the most technical build in this book, where you’ll 
manage to use practically every millimeter of internal 
space to make the model function yet maintain the 
iconic look of the real thing.
Finally, I’ll show you how to create a rubber-band 
shooter that looks identical to a MAC-11 submachine 
gun. You’ll see the complex engineering involved in 
creating a model that can fire rubber bands semi-
automatically while keeping it life-sized with many 
real-world details.
So what are you waiting for? Let’s get building!
Building Tips
The following techniques will make for easier building. 
• 
Whenever possible, work on a solid, flat sur-
face. Being able to press pieces onto the model 
using a fair amount of force (without breaking 
your build) is made significantly easier by working 
on a sturdy tabletop or countertop.
• 
Hang the model off the edge of your work sur-
face. When portions of the model protrude down 
(such as when the trigger is attached), try to work 
with the flat, bottom portion of the model on a flat 
surface and the descending portion hanging off 
the edge.

2 
Introduction
• 
Use a pencil tip to attach rubber bands.
• 
Ensure that pieces are completely and firmly 
attached. This is important with any LEGO model 
but especially with BrickGun designs, as the toler-
ances are very small and we can’t spare any space 
once we incorporate all the working mechanics. If 
you leave gaps between pieces, you may find that 
sections will not fit together properly or move as 
expected when the model is complete.
• 
Connect pieces starting from one end and 
“lean” them together. Rather than trying to 
snap two pieces together directly on top of one 
another, first attach the studs at one end and then 
press along the length of the pieces until they are 
securely connected. Contrary to popular belief, 
LEGO bricks and plates should never “snap” 
together (only Technic pieces do this); instead 
they should glide together quietly and smoothly.
How to Read the Instructions
Each model in the book uses a standard set of con-
ventions for building instructions. 
The Parts Lists
For each step, the parts you’ll need are shown in the 
upper left, next to the step number. Gather all the parts 
shown in the parts list before you place any of them on 
the model so you don’t forget anything.
Callouts
Callouts show small subassemblies that are built sepa-
rately and then attached to the main model. They are 
highlighted in yellow with pointers showing where the 

3
Introduction
subassembly attaches. Unless otherwise noted, 
the subassembly is oriented in exactly the same way 
as it is attached to the main model (see “Flip Arrows” 
below).
Inset Graphics
Inset graphics convey additional information about 
a section of the model. They often show the current 
step from a different angle to clarify how pieces are 
attached.
Flip Arrows
A gray square with two curved blue arrows tells you 
that pieces are reoriented. If the flip arrows are iso-
lated near the model, rotate the entire structure from 
the previous step so that it is oriented as shown. If 
the flip arrows lie on top of an arrow coming from a 
sub­assembly callout, rotate the sub­assembly before 
attaching it to the main model.
Subassemblies
When the assembly changes suddenly from one 
step to the next, you are starting a new section (sub­
assembly) of the model. Simply set aside your work; 
it will be used later.
Rubber Band Sizes
These are the rubber band sizes you will need to com-
plete the models in this book. Rubber bands are used 
to actuate mechanical movements, such as triggers, 
hammers, and slides. Using the correct size ensures

Introduction
the correct amount of tension and that the mecha-
nisms will move as expected. The rubber bands’ sizes 
and quantities are shown in the parts lists for each 
model. These rubber bands are standard in the LEGO 
system, and generic versions are also readily available 
from office supply stores.
Rubber Band Colors
Rubber bands are shown in various colors. These 
colors merely indicate which rubber band is which in 
the model and how they are attached. The actual color 
of the rubber bands you use is not important, as they’ll 
be hidden inside the model.
Mind the Details
Certain pieces have ridges, grooves, or other details 
that are often important. Always pay close attention to 
ensure that you are orienting these pieces exactly as 
they are shown in the instructions.

the LDraw suite (http://www.ldraw.org/ ), which is what 
I used to create the models shown in this book. 
History
The history of BrickGun began one fateful night in 
1999 when, on a whim, I decided to see whether I 
could put together a model of the Beretta 92. For me, 
the 92 has always been the handgun. I am partial to 
Italian design, and the lines of the 92—its iconic barrel 
top, curvy grip, and flowing shape—are unique and 
elegant. It is more like a piece of art than a weapon.
At the time, my only frame of reference was my 
memory. The build was spontaneous and inspired by 
the simple idea that a row of 2×2 round bricks laid 
horizontally between two 1-stud-wide bricks would 
mimic that iconic exposed barrel perfectly. 
This simple combination of pieces was the 
inspiration for my first handgun model.

5
Introduction
The model I created was solid and had no moving 
parts. Looking back on it now, it bears little resem-
blance to the actual handgun, and it wasn’t accurately 
life-sized either. But I was fairly happy with it—mostly 
because I had achieved a pretty good design on noth-
ing more than a lark.
My first version of the Beretta 92 was blocky and had no moving 
parts, but it captured the basic idea.
But over the next few days, the idea grew. What if I 
could make the trigger move? What about the hammer? 
And what if I could make the slide (the top portion of the 
gun that wraps around the barrel) move realistically? I 
started to consider the ways in which I might be able 
to make it all happen, which pieces could be used, and 
how rubber bands might be integrated to automate 
the movement. But I still wanted to keep the model 
life-sized.
Two versions later, I had created a design with a work-
ing trigger, hammer, slide, and slide lock. The model 
was fairly sturdy and approximately life-sized, and it 
looked more or less like the real thing.
The third version of the Beretta 92 with movable trigger, hammer, 
slide, and slide lock
I posted images and CAD files of my final model to 
LUGNET, the LEGO User Group Network community 
site for AFOLs (adult fans of LEGO). As these images 
started to circulate away from LUGNET and made their 
way to high-traffic, cool gadget sites, I was immedi-
ately inundated with requests from all over the world 
for information on how to purchase the model. The 
idea of starting a business had never even occurred 
to me; I just wanted to show my LEGO friends what I 
had created. But after a few weeks of getting requests 
to provide models or instructions, I decided to buy up 
a stock of parts and lay out instructions. And so the 
company that would one day be known as BrickGun 
was unofficially born.

6 
Introduction
As word of the 92 continued to spread, I put together 
the first version of my Heckler & Koch MP5. The MP5 
is my favorite submachine gun, so as with my favorite 
handgun, I decided to see if I could create a worthy 
model for it. Like the rounded barrel of the Beretta, 
the cylindrical body of the MP5 stood out to me, and I 
wanted to try building it with 2×2 round corner bricks.
The 2×2 round corner brick 
(aka “macaroni”) was the start-
ing point for my MP5 model.
This time, I researched the measurements of the 
real MP5 and built my model so that its dimensions 
matched them perfectly. Its removable magazine 
locked into place with a realistic mechanism, held the 
correct number of rounds, and was identical in size to 
the real thing, with the stock collapsed or extended. 
The MP5 was met with an even more avid reaction 
than the 92. The same sites that went wild over my 
realistic pistol were positively ballistic over my even-
more-realistic submachine gun. Unfortunately, due 
to the size and complexity of the model, selling kits 
wasn’t feasible at the time, but the attention it received 
continued to propel word of my designs worldwide. 
In 2003, after numerous requests from fans and cus-
tomers, I decided to try building a model of the Desert 
Eagle. But this time I chose to approach the design 
from a different angle. I had spent enough time with 
my 92 model that I could appreciate how inaccurate 
it was when compared to the real thing, and with the 
MP5, I had started to learn how to incorporate real-
world attributes to increase accuracy. With the Des-
ert Eagle, I wanted a model that was as accurate as 
possible in both size and detail. After all, the Desert 
Eagle’s strongest trait is that it is just plain huge, so 
I had to get that perfect, and the trademark angled 
shape of the barrel is immediately recognizable­—I had 
to get that perfect too.
I now use the process I developed for the Desert Eagle 
for every life-sized model I create. Suffice it to say, 
once the Desert Eagle was completed, I had to go 
back and completely redesign my original Beretta 92.

Introduction
The fourth version of the 92 was built exactly to the 
dimensions of the real gun, with details that made it 
unmistakably recognizable, and I was able retain all 
of the working mechanical functions (trigger, hammer, 
slide, and slide lock) from my original design. The final 
version of the Beretta was deemed the “92FS,” and to 
this day I feel it is the best model I’ve created in terms 
of detail and accuracy.

niques perfected with the MP5 and Desert Eagle
Following the creation of the new 92FS and Desert 
Eagle, BrickGun.com was officially formed as a com-
pany. The website went up with a catalog of models 
that also included my newest creation at the time: the 
BG17, my version of the G17 pistol. 
Next I created a MAC-11 rubber-band shooter, which 
had the notable achievement of semiautomatic firing 
through the use of an escapement mechanism. This 
model was followed by the BG19, which was essen-
tially the BG17 in compact form, just like its real-world 
namesake, the G19.

Introduction
In 2008 I broke new ground with the BG22. Dur-
ing the nine years since I had created the original 
Beretta 92 model, one of the feature requests I most 
often received was for a “working” magazine. I had 
attempted this from the very beginning, but due to 
the thickness of the bricks making up the grip, there 
simply wasn’t enough room to make a magazine that 
could be inserted into the gun and still maintain a 1:1 
scale. But after at least 20 attempts, I succeeded in 
bringing it all together in my BG22 model. I was not 
only able to create a 1:1-scale magazine (with a LEGO 
bullet!), which could be inserted and removed from 
the pistol, but I did it without having to give up any 
of the mechanical functions that already existed in the 
BG line of models. It had a working trigger, (internal) 
hammer, slide, slide lock, and now, finally, a working 
magazine. When you pulled the slide back and looked 
down the ejector port, you could even see the top of 
the magazine holding the LEGO bullet in the breach, 
exactly as with a real gun. The BG22 easily became 
my most successful model to date. 
The BrickGun BG22 with removable magazine
My latest creation is the Colt 1911, the second-most 
requested model by fans and customers. Cramming 
in all the mechanical functions while still keeping 
the scale 1:1 and making it look like the iconic 1911 
turned out to be the most difficult LEGO challenge 
I had ever undertaken. I worked on it for years, 
refining sections until they were just right and then 
encountering another hurdle. I’d put the model aside, 
mull over possible solutions (sometimes for months!) 
until I thought I had it worked out, and then give it a 
try. This routine went on and on until I eventually got 
the design to where I felt it absolutely could not be 
improved upon. This is the most complex model in 
the book.
