Dot 
The 
“dot” 
l has several 
meanings 
in mathematics, 
in- 
cluding 
MULTIPLICATION 
(a 
l b is pronounced 
“a times 
b”), computation 
of a DOT PRODUCT 
(a-b is pronounced 
“a dot b”), 
or computation 
of a time

(h is 
pronounced 
“a dot”).

The 
dot product 
can be defined 
by 
X*Y=

(‘1) 
where 
0 is the 
angle 
between 
the 
vectors. 
It 
follows 
immediately 
that 
X - Y = 0 if X is PERPENDICULAR 
to 
Y. 
The 
dot product 
is also called 
the INNER 
PRODUCT 
and written 
(n, b). By writing 
A, = ACOSBA 
l3, 
= BcosBg

A, = Asir&

Dowker 
Notation 
A simple 
way to describe 
a knot 
projection. 
The advan- 
tage of this notation 
is that 
it enables 
a KNOT DIAGRAM 
to be drawn 
quickly. 
For an oriented 
ALTERNATING 
KNOT 
with 
n crossings, 
begin 
at an arbitrary 
crossing 
and label 
it 1. Now fol- 
low the undergoing 
strand 
to the next 
crossing, 
and de- 
note it 2. Continue 
around 
the knot 
following 
the same 
strand 
until 
each 
crossing 
has been 
numbered 
twice. 
Each 
crossing 
will 
have one even number 
and one odd 
number, 
with 
the numbers 
running 
from 
1 to 2n. 
Now write 
out the ODD NUMBERS 1, 3, . l . , 2n - 1 in 
a row, and underneath 
write 
the even crossing 
number 
corresponding 
to each number. 
The 
Dowker 
NOTATION 
is this bottom 
row of numbers. 
When 
the sequence 
of 
even numbers 
can be broken 
into 
two permutations 
of 
consecutive 
sequences 
(such as {4,6,2} 
{10,12,8}), 
the 
knot 
is composite 
and is not uniquely 
determined 
by the 
Dowker 
notation. 
Otherwise, 
the knot 
is prime 
and the 
NOTATION uniquely 
defines 
a single 
knot 
(for amphichi- 
ral knots) 
or corresponds 
to a single 
knot 
or its MIRROR 
IMAGE (for chiral 
knots). 
For general 
nonalternating 
knots, 
the procedure 
is mod- 
ified 
slightly 
by making 
the 
sign 
of the even numbers

Dragon 
Curve 
Nonintersecting 
curves 
which 
can be iterated 
to yield 
more 
and

sinuosity. 
They 
can be constructed 
by taking 
a path 
around 
a set of dots, 
representing 
a left 
turn 
by 
1 and 
a right 
turn 
by 0. 
The 
first-

curve is then 
denoted 
1. For higher 
order 
curves, 
add 
a 1 to the 
end, 
then 
copy 
the 
string 
of digits 
preceding 
it to the end but 
switching 
its center 
digit. 
For 
example, 
the

curve 
is generated 
as 
follows: 
(1)l 
--+ (1)1(O) 
-+ 
110, 
and 
the 
third 
as: 
(11O)l

By the DUALITY 
PRINCIPLE, for every POLYHEDRON, 
there 
exists 
another 
POLYHEDRON in which 
faces and 
VERTICES occupy 
complementary 
locations. 
This POLY- 
HEDRCIIL' is known 
as the dual, 
or RECIPROCAL. 
The 
dual 
polyhedron 
of a PLATONIC SOLID or ARCHIMED- 
EAN SOLID can be drawn by constructing 
EDGES tangent 
to the RECIPROCATING SPHERE (a.k.a. 
MIDSPHERE and 
INTERSPHERE) which 
are PERPENDICULAR to the origi- 
nal EDGES. 
The dual 
of a general 
solid can be computed 
by connect- 
ing the midpoints 
of the sides surrounding 
each VER- 
TEX, and constructing 
the corresponding 
tangent 
POLY- 
GON. (The 
tangent 
polygon 
is the polygon 
which 
is tan- 
gent to the CIRCUMCIRCLE of the POLYGON produced 
by connecting 
the MIDPOINT 
on the sides surrounding 
the given VERTEX.) 
The process is illustrated 
below for 
the PLATONIC SOLIDS. The POLYHEDRON COMPOUNDS 
consisting 
of a POLYHEDRON and its dual 
are generally 
very 
attractive,

are also illustrated

For p > 0, 
the equation 
represents 
a “hard

and for p < 0, 
it represents 
a “soft spring.” 
If p < 0, the phase portrait

These 
curves appear 
in Diirer’s 
work Instruction 
in Mea- 
surement 
with 
Compasses 
and Straight 
Edge (1525) 
and 
arose in investigations 
of perspective. 
Diirer 
constructed 
the curve by drawing 
lines QRP 
and P’QR 
of length 
16 
units 
through 
Q(q, 0) and R(T, 0), where q+~ 
= 13. The 
locus 
of P and 
P’ 
is the curve, 
although 
Diirer 
found 
only 
one of the two branches 
of the curve. 
The 
ENVELOPE of the 
lines 
QRP 
and 
P'QR is 
a 
PARABOLA, and the curve 
is therefore 
a GLISSETTE of 
a point 
on a line 
segment 
sliding 
between 
a PARABOLA 
and one ofits 
TANGENTS. 
Diirer 
called 
the curve “Muschellini,” 
which means CON- 
CHOID. 
However, 
it is not 
a true 
CONCHOID 
and so is 
sometimes 
called 
D~~RER'S SHELL CURVE. The 
Carte- 
sian equation 
is 
2y2(22 + y2) - 2by2(x 
+ y) + (b2 - 3a2)y2 
- a2x2 
+ 2a2b(x 
+ y) + a2(a2 - b2) = 0. 
The 
above 
curves 
are for (a$) 
= 
(3, l), 
(3,3), 
(3,5). 
There 
are a number 
of interesting 
special 
cases. If b = 0, 
the curve becomes 
two coincident 
straight 
lines 
x = 0. 
For a = 0, the 
curve 
becomes 
the line 
pair 
x = 
b/2, 
x= 
-b/2, 
together 
with 
the CIRCLE x + y = b. 
If 
a = b/2, the curve has a CUSP at (-2a,a).

Dynamical 
System 
A means 
of describing 
how one state 
develops 
into 
an- 
other 
state 
over the course 
of time. 
Technically, 
a dy- 
namical 
system 
is a smooth 
action 
of the reals or the IN- 
TEGERS on another 
object 
(usually 
a MANIFOLD). 
When 
the reals 
are acting, 
the 
system 
is called 
a continuous 
dynamical 
system, 
and when the INTEGERS are acting, 
the system 
is called 
a discrete 
dynamical 
system. 
If f 
is any CONTINUOUS FUNCTION, then 
the evolution 
of a 
variable 
II: can be given 
by the formula 
Xn+l 
= 
f (Xn)* 
(1) 
This equation 
can also be viewed as a difference 
equation 
x,+1 
- xn = f(G) 
- G-L, 
(2) 
so defining 
g(x) 
= f (4 
- x 
(3) 
gives 
X72+1-Xn 
= 
g(GJ

(4) 
which can be read “as 72 changes 
by 1 unit, 
x changes by 
g(z).” 
This

Examples 
of e MNEMONICS 
(Gardner 
1959, 
1991) 
in- 
clude: 
“By omnibus 
I traveled 
to Brooklyn” 
(6 digits). 
“To 
disrupt 
a playroom 
is commonly 
a practice 
of 
children” 
(10 digits). 
“It 
enables 
a numsk 
numerals” 
( 10 digits) 
ull 
to m .emor ,ize a quantity 
of 
“I’m 
forming 
a mnemonic 
to remember 
a function 
in 
analysis” 
(10 digits). 
“He repeats: 
I shouldn’t 
be tippling, 
I shouldn’t 
be 
toppling 
here!” 
(11 digits). 
“In showing 
a painting 
to probably 
a critical 
or ven- 
omous 
lady, 
anger 
dominates. 
0 take 
guard, 
or she 
raves and shouts” 
(21 digits). 
Here, 
the word 
“0” 
stands 
for the number 
0. 
A much 
more 
extensive 
mnemonic 
giving 
40 digits 
is 
“We 
present 
a mnemonic 
to memorize 
a constant 
so exciting 
that 
Euler 
exclaimed: 
‘!’ 
when 
first 
it 
was found, 
yes, loudly 
‘!‘. 
My 
students 
perhaps 
will 
compute 
e, use power or Taylor 
series, an easy sum- 
mation 
formula, 
obvious, 
clear, 
elegant!” 
(Bare1 
1995). 
In the latter, 
OS are represented 
with 
“!“. 
A list of e mnemonics 
in several 
languages 
is maintained 
by A. P. Hatzipolakis. 
Scanning 
the 
decimal 
expansion 
of e until 
all

the last appearing 
is 6, 12, 548,

Given 
a 3 x 3 MATRIX 
A with eigenvectors 
x1, x2, and x3 
and corresponding 
EIGENVALUES 
X1, X2, and &, 
then 
an arbitrary 
VECTOR 
y can be written 
Eigenvector 
Y = bm 
+ b2x2 + b3xs 
Applying 
the MATRIX 
A, 
Ay = blAxl 
+ b2Ax2 + b3Ax3 
(11) 
A right 
eigenvector 
satisfies 
Ax = xx, 
(1) 
where X is a column 
VECTOR. 
The right 
EIGENVALUES 
therefore 
satisfy 
IA - xl/ = o. 
(2) 
A left eigenvector 
satisfies 
Any = x1” 
[blxl 
+ (2)~blxz 
+ ($)nb3x3]. 
(13) 
If X1 > X2, & 
it therefore 
follows 
that 
xA = xx, 
where X is a row VECTOR, 
so 
wvT 
= X&XT 
(3) 
(4) 
so repeated 
application 
of the matrix 
to an arbitrary 
vec- 
tor results 
in a vector 
proportional 
to the EIGENVECTOR 
having 
the largest 
EIGENVALUE.

EIGENFUNCTION,

ATxT 
= XLxT, 
(5) 
where XT 
is the transpose 
of X. 
The left, EIGENVALUES 
satisfy 
IA T - ALlI = IAT - XJTl 
= I(A - XLI)TI 
= I(A - ALI)/, 
(6) 
(since 
IA] = 
IATl) 
where 
IAf is the DETERMINANT 
of 
A. But 
this 
is the same 
equation 
satisfied 
by the right 
EIGENVALUES, 
so the left 
and right, 
EXGENVALUES 
are 
the same. 
Let XR 
be a MATRIX 
formed 
by the columns 
of the right 
eigenvectors 
and XL 
be a MATRIX 
formed 
by the rows of the left eigenvectors.

These 
are the axioms

theory, 
instead 
of requiring 
that 
H(a)

to be a co-functor 
(meaning 
the INDUCED MAP points

With 
that 
modification, 
the axioms

that 
all the induced

point

Elements 
The 
classic 
treatise 
in geometry 
written 
by Euclid 
and 
used as a textbook 
for more 
than 
1,000 years in western 
Europe. 
The Elements, 
which 
went through 
more 
than 
2,000 editions 
and consisted 
of 465 propositions, 
are di- 
vided

The

with

five POSTu- 
LATES, 
and five “common 
notions,” 
and systematically 
built 
the rest of plane 
and solid geometry 
upon this foun- 
dation. 
The five EUCLID'S 
POSTULATES 
are 
1. It is possible 
to draw 
to another 
POINT. 
a straight 
LINE from any POINT 
2. It is possible 
to produce

3. It is possible 
to describe 
a CIRCLE

4. All RIGHT 
ANGLES 
are equal 
to one another. 
5. If a straight 
LINE falling 
on two straight 
LINES makes 
the interior 
ANGLES 
on the same side less than 
two 
RIGHT 
ANGLES, 
the straight 
LINES 
(if extended

definitely) 
meet 
on the 
side on which 
the 
ANGLES 
which 
are less than 
two RIGHT 
ANGLES 
lie. 
(Dunham 
1990). 
Euclid’s 
fifth postulate 
is known 
as the 
PARALLEL 
POSTULATE. 
After 
more 
than 
two millennia 
of study, 
this 
POSTULATE 
was found 
to be independent 
of the others. 
In 
fact, 
equally 
valid 
NON-EUCLIDEAN 
GEOMETRIES 
were found 
to be possible 
by changing 
the 
assumption 
of this POSTULATE. 
Unfortunately, 
Euclid’s 
postulates 
were not rigorously 
complete 
and left a large 
number 
of gaps. 
Hilbert 
needed 
a total 
of 20 postulates 
to construct 
a logically 
complete 
geometry.

Elevator 
Paradox 
A fact noticed 
by physicist 
G. Gamow 
when he had an 
office 
on the second 
floor 
and 
physicist 
M. 
Stern 
had 
stop 
on his floor 
was going 
down, 
whereas 
about 
the 
same 
fraction 
of time, 
the first 
elevator 
to stop on the 
sixth 
floor 
was going 
up. 
This 
actually 
makes 
perfect 
sense, since 5 of the 6 floors 
1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are above the 
second, 
and 5 of the 6 floors 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 are below the 
sixth. 
However, 
the 
situation 
takes 
some 
unexpected 
turns 
if more 
than 
one elevator 
is involved, 
as discussed 
by Gardner 
(1986).

form

The parameter 
b is called 
the SEMIMINOR 
AXIS by anal- 
ogy with 
the parameter 
a, which 
is called 
the SEMIMA- 
JOR 
AXIS. 
The 
fact 
that 
b as defined 
above 
is actu- 
ally 
the SEMIMINOR 
AXIS 
is easily 
shown 
by letting 
~1 
and 
~2 be equal. 
Then 
two RIGHT 
TRIANGLES 
are pro- 
duced, 
each with 
HYPOTENUSE 
a, base c, and height 
b = &F-Z?. 
Since the largest 
distance 
along 
the MI- 
NOR AXIS 
will be achieved 
at this point, 
b is indeed 
the 
SEMIMINOR 
AXIS. 
The 
ellipse 
was first 
studied 
by Menaechmus, 
investi- 
gated 
by Euclid, 
and named 
by Apollonius. 
The FOCUS 
and 
DIRECTRIX 
of an ellipse 
were considered 
by Pap- 
pus. 
In 
1602, 
Kepler 
believed 
that 
the 
orbit 
of Mars 
was OVAL; he later 
discovered 
that 
it was an ellipse 
with 
the Sun at one FOCUS. 
In fact, 
Kepler 
introduced 
the 
word 
‘LF~~~~” 
and published 
his discovery 
in 1609. 
In 
1705 Halley 
showed that 
the comet 
which 
is now named 
after 
him 
moved 
in an elliptical 
orbit 
around 
the Sun 
(MacTutor 
Archive). 
If, instead 
of being 
centered 
at (0, 0), the CENTER 
of 
the ellipse 
is at (20, yo), equation 
(9) becomes 
A ray passing 
through 
a FOCUS 
will 
pass through 
the 
other 
focus after a single bounce. 
Reflections 
not passing 
through 
a FOCUS will be tangent 
to a confocal 
HYPER- 
BOLA or ELLIPSE, 
depending 
on whether 
the ray passes 
between 
the FOCI 
or not. 
Let 
an ellipse 
lie along 
the 
X-AXIS 
and find the equation 
of the figure

In POLAR COORDINATES, the ANGLE 8’ measured

Elliptic 
Curve 
Informally, 
an elliptic 
curve 
is a type 
of CUBIC 
CURVE 
whose solutions 
are confined 
to a region 
of space which 
is topologically 
equivalent 
to a TORUS. 
Formally, 
an 
elliptic 
curve 
over 
a FIELD 
K 
is a nonsingular 
CUBIC 
CURVE 
in two variables, 
f(X, 
Y) = 0, with 
a K-rational 
point 
(which 
may 
be a point 
at infinity). 
The 
FIELD 
Kc is usually 
taken 
to be the 
COMPLEX 
NUMBERS 
c, 
REALS 
Iw, RATIONALS 
Q, algebraic 
extensions 
of Q, p- 
ADIC NUMBERS 
&, 
or a FINITE 
FIELD.

+ Ex2 
+Fxy+Gy2+Hx+Iy+J=0, 
(1) 
where 
A, B, 
. . . , are elements 
of K, 
can be written 
in 
the form 
y2 = x3 + ux + b, 
(2) 
where the right 
side of (2) has no repeated 
factors. 
If K 
has CHARACTERISTIC 
three, 
then 
the best that 
can be 
done is to transform 
the curve into 
y2 = x3 + ax2 + bx + c 
(3)

If the underlying 
FIELD 
of an elliptic 
curve is algebraic- 
ally 
closed, 
then 
a straight 
line 
cuts an elliptic 
curve at 
three 
points 
(counting 
multiple 
roots 
at points 
of tan- 
gency). 
If two are known, 
it is possible 
to compute 
the 
third. 
If two of the intersection 
points 
are K-RATIONAL, 
then 
so is the 
third. 
Let 
(xl, ~1) and 
(22, yz) be two 
points 
on an elliptic 
curve 
E with 
DISCRXMXNANT 
AE = -16(4a3 
+ 27b’)

Then 
the coordinates

point 
are

y3

X(x3

For elliptic 
curves over Q, Mordell 
proved 
that 
there are 
a finite 
number 
of integral 
solutions.

The 
amazing 
TANIYAMA-SHIMURA 
CONJECTURE 
states 
that 
all rational 
elliptic 
curves 
are also modular. 
This 
fact is far from 
obvious, 
and despite 
the fact that 
the 
conjecture 
was proposed 
in 1955, it was not proved 
until 
1995. 
Even so, Wiles’ 
proof 
surprised 
most 
mathemati- 
cians, who had believed 
the conjecture 
unassailable. 
As 
a side benefit, 
Wiles’ 
proof 
of the TANIYAMA-SHIMURA 
CONJECTURE 
also laid 
to rest the famous 
and thorny 
problem 
which had baffled 
mathematicians 
for hundreds 
of years, FERMAT’S

THEOREM.

The 
GROUP 
of an 
ELLIPTIC 
CURVE 
which 
has been 
transformed 
to the form 
y2 = x3 + ax + b 
is the set of K-RATIONAL 
POINTS, 
including 
the single 
POINT 
AT INFINITY. 
The 
group 
law (addition) 
is de- 
fined as follows: 
Take 
2 &RATIONAL 
POINTS 
P and Q. 
Now 
‘draw’ 
a straight 
line 
through 
them 
and compute 
the third 
point 
of intersection 
R (also 
a K-RATIONAL 
POINT). 
Then 
P+Q+R=O 
gives the identity 
point 
at infinity. 
Now find the inverse 
of R, which 
can be done 
by setting 
R = 
(a, b) giving 
-R 
= (a, 4). 
This 
remarkable 
result 
is only 
a special 
case of a more 
general 
procedure. 
Essentially, 
the 
reason 
is that 
this 

Elliptic 
Curve Primality

type 
of ELLIPTIC 
CURVE 
has a single 
point 
at infinity 
which 
is an inflection 
point 
(the 
line 
at infinity 
meets 
the curve 
at a single 
point 
at infinity, 
so it must 
be an 
intersection 
of multiplicity 
three).

The

If this ratio

the function

to a singly

function 
if it is 
rational 
and a constant 
if the ratio 
is irrational 
(Jacobi, 
1835).

The 
number 
of POLES

The 
number 
of ROOTS in a cell is finite. 
The 
sum of RESIDUES 
in any cell is 0. 
LIOUVILLE'S ELLIPTIC FUNCTION THEOREM: Anel- 
liptic 
function 
with 
no POLES 
in a cell is a constant. 
The number 
of zeros of f(z) - c (the “order”) 
equals 
the number 
of POLES 
of f(z). 
The 
simplest 
elliptic 
function 
has order 
two, since a 
function 
of order 
one would 
have 
a simple 
irreducible 
POLE, which would 
need to have a NONZERO residue. 
By property 
(3), this 
is impossible. 
Elliptic 
functions 
with 
a single 
POLE 
of order 
2 with 
RESIDUE 
0 are called WEIERSTRAB ELLIPTIC FUNC- 
TIONS. 
Elliptic 
functions 
with 
two simple 
POLES 
having 
residues 
a0 and 
--a0 
are called 
JACOBI 
EL- 
LIPTIC FUNCTIONS. 
Any 
elliptic 
function 
is expressible 
in terms 
of ei- 
ther 
WEIERSTRAB ELLIPTIC 
FUNCTION or JACOBI 
ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS. 
The 
sum of the AFFIXES of ROOTS 
equals 
the sum 
of the AFFIXES 
of the POLES. 
An algebraic 
relationship 
exists between 
any two el- 
liptic 
functions 
with 
the same periods. 
The elliptic 
functions 
are inversions 
of the ELLIPTIC IN- 
TEGRALS. The 
two standard 
forms 
of these functions 
are known 
as JACOBI ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS and WEIER- 
STRAB ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS. JACOBI ELLIPTIC FUNC-

Elliptic 
integrals 
can be viewed 
as generalizations 
of the 
TRIGONOMETRIC 
FUNCTIONS and provide 
solutions 
to 
a wider 
class of problems. 
For instance, 
while 
the ARC 
LENGTH of a CIRCLE 
is given 
as a simple 
function 
of the 
parameter, 
computing 
the ARC LENGTH 
of an ELLIPSE 
requires 
an elliptic 
integral. 
Similarly, 
the position 
of a 
pendulum 
is given 
by a TRIGONOMETRIC 
FUNCTION 
as 
a function 
of time 
for small 
angle 
oscillations, 
but 
the 
full solution 
for arbitrarily 
large 
displacements 
requires 
the use of elliptic 
integrals. 
Many 
other 
problems 
in 
electromagnetism 
and gravitation 
are solved 
by elliptic 
integrals.

(by 
analogy 
with 
the inverse 
trigonometric

If 4 = r/2,

(Borwein

Now we make 
the further 
substitution 
u E i(t 
- ab/t). 
The 
differential 
becomes 
But 
2ut = t2 - ab 
t2 - 2ut - ab = 0 
t=+(2uf&qzi)=ufJu2+ab, 
(64) 
(65) 
(66) 
du = $(I 
+ ab/t2) 
dt, 
(51) 
but 
2u = t - ab/t, 
so 
so 
t-u=fJu2Sab, 
and (63) becomes 
(67) 
2u/t 
= 1 - abIt 
(52) 
and 
abIt 
= 1 - 221/t 
1-t 
abIt 
= 2 - 2u/t 
= 2(1 - u/t). 
(53) 
(54) 
T(a, 
b) = 
J 
du 
7T -m 
J[4u2 
+ (at- 
b)2](~2

However, 
the left side is always positive, 
so 
(68) 
1 + abIt 
= 2 - 2u/t 
= 211 - u/t1 
(55) 
We have therefore 
demonstrated 
that 
and the differential 
is 
T(a, 
b) = T( +(a + b), Jab). 
(69) 
dt=f+* 
(56) 
We can thus iterate 
ai+ 
= 
i(ai 
+ bi) 
(70) 
We need to take some care with the limits 
of integration. 
Write 
(50) as 
b. a+1 
= 
d 
aA, 
(71) 
as many 
times 
as we wish, without 
changing 
the value of 
the integral. 
E3ut this iteration 
is the same as and there- 
fore converges 
to the ARITHMETIC-GEOMETRIC 
MEAN, 
so the iteration 
terminates 
at a; = bi = M(ao, 
bo), and 
we have 
Jrn J o- 
f(t) dt = 
f 0) dt + f(t) dt- (57) 
-m -m 
Now 
change 
the limits 
to those 
appropriate

so we have picked 
up a factor 
of 2 which 
must 
be in- 
cluded. 
Using 
this 
fact and plugging 
(56) in (50) there- 
fore gives 
T(a, b) = 2 n

(72) 
Now note 
that 
(59) 
Complete 
elliptic 
integrals 
arise in finding 
the arc length 
of an ELLIPSE 
and the period 
of a pendulum. 
They 
also 
arise in a natural 
way from 
the theory 
of THETA 
FUNC- 
TIONS. 
Complete 
elliptic 
integrals 
can be computed 
us- 
ing a procedure 
involving 
the ARITHMETIC-GEOMETRIC

Note 
that 
u2 = t4 - 2abt2 + a2b2

also show that

Elliptic

When 
the MODULUS 
Jz has a singular 
value, 
the complete 
elliptic 
integrals 
may 
be computed 
in analytic 
form 
in 
terms 
of GAMMA FUNCTIONS. 
Abel 
(quoted 
in Whit-. 
taker

1990, p. 525) proved 
that 
whenever 
(1) 
where 
a, b, c, d, and n are INTEGERS, K(k) 
is a com- 
plete 
ELLIPTIC 
INTEGRAL OF THE FIRST KIND, 
and 
K’(k) 
= 
K(q’i=i?) 
is the 
complementary 
complete 
ELLIPTIC 
INTEGRAL 
OF THE FIRST KIND, 
then 
the 
MODULUS 
k is the ROOT of an algebraic 
equation 
with 
INTEGER 
COEFFICIENTS. 
A MODULUS 
k, such that 
(2) 
is called 
a singular 
value 
of the 
elliptic 
integral. 
The 
ELLIPTIC LAMBDA FUNCTION A*(T) 
gives the value 
of 
k,. 
Selberg 
and 
Chowla 
(1967) 
showed 
that 
K@*(r)) 
and E(X* (T)) are expressible 
in terms 
of a finite 
number 
of GAMMA FUNCTIONS. The 
complete 
ELLIPTIC INTE- 
GRALS OF THE SECOND KIND E(k,) 
and E’(k,+) 
canbe 
expressed 
in terms 
of K(kT) 
and K’(k,) 
with 
the aid of 
the ELLIPTIC ALPHA FUNCTION a(r). 
The

Furthermore,

Encoding 
An encoding 
is a way of representing 
a number 
or expres- 
sion in terms 
of another 
(usually 
simpler) 
one. However, 
multiple 
expressions 
can also be encoded 
as a single 
ex- 
pression, 
as in, for example, 
(l&b) 
= $[(u + q2 + 3a + b] 
which 
encodes 
a and b uniquely 
as a single 
number.

Enneper’s 
Surfaces 
The 
Enneper 
surfaces 
are a three-parameter 
family 
of 
surfaces 
with 
constant 
curvature. 
In general, 
they 
are 
described 
by elliptic 
functions. 
However, 
special 
cases 
which 
can be specified 
parametrically 
using 
ELEMEN- 
TARY 
FUNCTION 
include 
the 
KUEN 
SURFACE, 
REMBS’ 
SURFACES, and 
SIEVERT'S 
SURFACE. 
The 
surfaces 
shown above can be generated 
using the ENNEPER-WEI- 
ERSTRAB 
PARAMETERIZATION 
with 
f(5) = 1 
(1) 
g(C) = c* 
(2) 
Letting 
z = rei$ 
and taking 
the REAL PART give 
where 
T E [O,l] 
and 
4 E [-n, 
n). 
Letting 
x = u + iv 
instead 
gives the figure 
on the right, 
(do Carmo 
1986, Gray 
1993, Nordstrand). 
This 
surface 
has a HOLE 
in its middle. 
Nordstrand 
gives the implicit 
form 
(

An epicycloid 
with 
one cusp is called 
a CARDIOID, 
one 
with 
two cusps is called 
a NEPHROID, 
and one with 
five 
cusps is called 
a RANUNCULOID. 
n-epicycloids 
can also be constructed 
by beginning 
with 
the DIAMETER 
of a CIRCLE, 
offsetting 
one end by a se- 
ries of steps while 
at the same time 
offsetting 
the other 
end by steps n times 
as large. 
After 
traveling 
around 
the 
CIRCLE 
once, 
an n-cusped 
epicycloid 
is produced, 
as illustrated 
above 
(Madachy 
1979). 
Epicycloids 
have TORSION 
and satisfy

p is the RADIUS 
OF CURVATURE

Given 
the distances 
of a point 
from 
the three 
corners 
of 
an equilateral 
triangle, 
a, b, and c, the length 
of a side 
s is given 
by 
3(a4 + b4 + c4 + s4) = (2 
+ b2 + c2 + s2)2 
(1) 
(Gardner 
1977, pp. 56-57 
and 63). 
There 
are infinitely 
many 
solutions 
for which 
a, b, and c are INTEGERS. 
In 
these cases, one of a, 6, c, and s is DIVISIBLE 
by 3, one 
by 5, one by 7, and one by 8 (Guy 
1994, p. 183). 
The 
ALTITUDE 
h of an equilateral 
triangle 
is 
h = +&,

where s is the side length, 
so the AREA 
is

Equilic 
Quadrilateral 
A QUADRILATERAL 
in which 
a pair 
of opposite 
sides 
have the same 
length 
and 
are inclined 
at 60” to each 
other 
(or equivalently, 
satisfy 
(A) + (B) = lZO”). 
Some 
interesting 
theorems 
hold 
for such quadrilaterals. 
Let 
ABCD 
be an equilic 
quadrilateral 
with 
AD 
= BC 
and 
(A) + (B) = 120’. 
Then 
1. The MIDPOINTS P, 
Q, and R of the diagonals 
and 
the 
side 
CD 
always 
determine 
an EQUILATERAL 
TRIANGLE. 
2. If EQUILATERAL 
TRIANGLE 
PCD 
is drawn 
out- 
wardly 
on CD, 
then APAB 
is also an EQUILATERAL 
TRIANGLE. 
3. If EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES are drawn 
on AC,DC,

Equinumerous 
Let

be two classes of POSITIVE integers. 
Let

be the number 
of integers 
in A which are less than

to n, and let B(n) 
be the number 
of integers 
in 
B which

Equivalence 
Class 
An equivalence 
class is defined 
as a SUBSET of the form 
{z E X : sRa}, 
where a is an element 
of X and the NO- 
TATION “xRy” 
is used to mean 
that 
there 
is an EQUIV- 
ALENCE RELATION between 
x and y. It can be shown 
that 
any two equivalence 
classes are either 
equal 
or dis- 
joint, 
hence the collection 
of equivalence 
classes forms 
a 
partition 
of X. 
For all a, b E X, we have aRb IFF a and 
b belong 
to the same equivalence 
class. 
A set of CLASS REPRESENTATIVES is a SUBSET of X 
which 
contains 
EXACTLY ONE element 
from 
each equiv- 
alence 
class. 
For n a POSITIVE INTEGER, and ~$INTEGERS, 
consider 
the CONGRUENCE a E b (mod 
n), then 
the equivalence 
classes are the sets {. 
l . , -2n, 
-n, 
0, n, 2n, . . . }, {. 
l . , 
1 - 2n, 1 - n, 1, 1 + n, 1 + 2n, . . l } etc. 
The 
standard 
CLASS REPRESENTATIVES are taken 
to be 0, 1, 2,

Ergodic 
Measure 
An ENDUMORPHISM is called 
ergodic 
if it is true 
that 
TalA 
= A IMPLIES m(A) 
= 0 or 1, where PA 
= {zc E 
X 
: T(z) 
f A}. 
Examples 
of ergodic 
endomorphisms 
include 
the 
MAP 
X 
-+ 2rr: mod 
1 on the unit 
interval 
with LEBESGUE MEASURE, certain 
AUTOMORPHISMS of 
the TORUS, and 
“Bernoulli 
shifts” 
(and more 
generally 
“Markov 
shifts”). 
Given 
a MAP T and a SIGMA ALGEBRA, there 
may 
be 
many 
ergodic 
measures. 
If there 
is only 
one ergodic 
measure, 
then 
T is called 
uniquely 
ergodic. 
An example 
of a uniquely 
ergodic 
transformation 
is the MAP 
EL: H z+ 
a mod 
1 on the uni t interval 
when a is irrational. 
Here, 
the un .ique ergodic 
measure is LEBESGUE MEASU RE. 
Ergodic 
Theory 
Ergodic 
theory 
can be described 
as the statistical 
and 
qualitative 
behavior 
of measurable 
group 
and semigroup 
actionson 
MEASURE SPACES. The GROUP is mostcom- 
monly 
N, Iw, IV, 
and Z. 
Ergodic 
theory 
had its origins 
in the work of Boltzmann 
in statistical 
mechanics. 
Its mathematical 
origins 
are 
due 
to von 
Neumann, 
Birkhoff, 
and 
Koopman 
in the 
1930s. 
It 
has since 
grown 
to be a huge 
subject 
and 
has applications 
not 
only 
to statistical 
mechanics, 
but 
also to number 
theory, 
differential 
geometry, 
functional 
analysis, 
etc. 
There 
are also many 
internal 
problems

Error- Correcting 
Code 
Error Propagation 
Error-Correcting 
Code 
An error-correcting 
code is an algorithm 
for expressing 
a sequence 
of numbers 
such that 
any errors 
which 
are 
introduced 
can be detected 
and 
corrected 
(within 
cer- 
tain 
limitations) 
based on the remaining 
numbers.

as CODING THEORY.

(6) 
Error 
detection 
is much 
simpler 
than 
error 
correction, 
and one or more 
“check” 
digits 
are commonly 
embedded 
The CUMULANTS are 
in credit 
card numbers 
in order to detect 
mistakes. 
Early 
space probes 
like Mariner 
used a type of error-correcting 
Kl = 0 
(7) 
code called 
a block 
code, and more 
recent 
space probes 
use convolution 
codes. 
Error-correcting 
codes are also 
used in CD players, 
high 
speed 
modems, 
and cellular 
phones. 
Modems 
use error detection 
when they compute 
CHECKSUMS, 
which 
are sums 
of the 
digits 
in a given 
transmission 
modulo 
some 
number. 
The 
ISBN 
used to 
identify 
books 
also incorporates 
a check 
DIGIT. 
A powerful 
check for 13 DIGIT numbers 
consists 
of the 
following. 
Write 
the 
number 
as a string 
of DIGITS 
UlU2a3-..Ul3. 
Take al+as+.. 
. + a13 and double. 
Now 
add the number 
of DIGITS in ODD positions 
which 
are 
> 4 to this 
number. 
Now add a2 + a4 + . . . + a12. The 
check number 
is then 
the number 
required 
to bring 
the 
last DIGIT 
to 0. 
This 
scheme 
detects 
all single 
DIGIT 
errors 
and all TRANSPOSITIONS of adject 
DIGITS except 
0 and 9.

An estimate 
is an educated 
guess for an unknown 
quan- 
tity 
or outcome 
based on known 
information. 
The mak- 
ing of estimates 
is an important 
part 
of statistics, 
since 
care is needed 
to provide 
as accurate 
an estimate 
as 
possible 
using 
as little 
input 
data 
as possible. 
Often, 
an 
estimate 
for the uncertainty 
AE 
of an estimate 
E can 
also be determined 
statistically. 
A rule that 
tells how to 
calculate 
an estimate 
based 
on the measurements 
con- 
tained 
in a sample 
is called 
an ESTIMATOR.

Estimator 
An estimator 
is a rule 
that 
tells 
how to calculate 
an 
ESTIMATE based 
on the 
measurements 
contained 
in a 
sample. 
For example, 
the 
“sample 
MEAN" AVERAGE a: 
is an estimator 
for the population 
MEAN p. 
The 
mean 
square 
error 
of an estimator 
8 is defined 
by 
MSE 
= ((8 - 0)“). 
Let B be the BIAS, 
then 
MSE 
= ([(s - (8)) 
+ B@)12) 
= ((8 - (8))2) 
+ B2(8) 
= v(e) 
+ B2(8),

A straight 
LINE 
SEGMENT 
can be drawn joining 
any 
two points. 
Any straight 
LINE SEGMENT can be extended 
indef- 
initely 
in a straight 
LINE. 
Given 
any straight 
LINE SEGMENT, a CIRCLE can 
be drawn 
having 
the 
segment 
as RADIUS 
and 
one 
endpoint 
as center. 
All RIGHT ANGLES are congruent. 
If two lines are drawn 
which 
intersect 
a third 
in such 
a way that 
the sum of the inner 
angles 
on one side 
is less than 
two RIGHT ANGLES, then 
the two lines 
inevitably 
must 
intersect 
each other 
on that 
side if 
extended 
far enough. 
This 
postulate 
is equivalent 
to 
what 
is known 
as the PARALLEL POSTULATE. 
Euclid’s 
fifth 
postulate 
cannot 
be proven 
as a theorem, 
although 
this 
was attempted 
by many 
people. 
Euclid 
himself 
used only 
the first 
four postulates 
(“ABSOLUTE 
GEOMETRY") 
for the 
first 
28 propositions 
of the 
Ele- 
ments, 
but 
was forced 
to invoke 
the PARALLEL POSTU- 
LATE on the 
29th. 
In 
1823, 
Janos 
Bolyai 
and Nicolai 
Lobachevsky 
independently 
realized 
that 
entirely 
self- 
consistent 
WON-EUCLIDEAN 
GEOMETRIES" could 
be 
created 
in which 
the 
parallel 
postulate 
did 
not 
hold. 
(Gauss had also discovered 
but suppressed 
the existence 
of non-Euclidean 
geometries.)

Euclid’s 
Principle 
see EUCLID'S THEOREMS 
Euclid’s 
Theorems 
A theorem 
sometimes 
called 
“Euclid’s 
First 
Theorem” 
or EUCLID'S 
PRINCIPLE states 
that 
if p is a PRIME 
and pjab, 
then p/a or pjb (where 
1 means 
DIVIDES). 
A 
COROLLARY is that 
pIan 
I 
p/a (Conway 
and Guy 1996). 
The FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ARITHMETIC 
is an- 
other 
COROLLARY (Hardy 
and Wright 
1979). 
Euclid’s 
Second 
Theorem 
states 
that 
the 
number 
of 
PRIMES is INFINITE. 
This 
theorem, 
also called 
the IN- 
FINITUDE OF PRIMES theorem, 
was proved 
by Euclid 
in 
Proposition 
IX.20 
of the 
Elements. 
Ribenboim 
(1989) 
gives 
nine 
(and 
a half) 
proofs 
of this 
theorem. 
Eu- 
clid’s 
elegant 
proof 
proceeds 
as follows. 
Given 
a finite 
sequence 
of consecutive 
PRIMES 2, 3, 5, . . . , p, the num- 
ber 
N=2.3.5g**p+l, 
(1) 
known 
as the ith EUCL IDNUMBE R when p = pi is the ith 
PRIME , is either 
a new PRIMERS the pro duct of PRIMES. 

Euclid’s 
Theorems 
Euclidean 
Algorithm 
567 
If 1v is a PRIME, 
then 
it must 
be greater 
than 
the pre- 
vious 
PRIMES, 
since 
one plus 
the 
product 
of PRIMES 
must 
be greater 
than 
each PRIME 
composing 
the prod- 
uct. 
Now, 
if N is a product 
of PRIMES, 
then 
at least 
one of the PRIMES 
must 
be greater 
than 
p. This 
can be 
shown as follows. 
If nT is COMPOSITE 
and not greater 
than 
p, then 
one of its factors 
(say F) must 
be one of 
the PRIMES 
in the sequence, 
2, 3, 5, . . l , p. 
It therefore 
DIVIDES 
the product 
2 
l 3 
l 5 l 
l 9~. However, 
since it is 
a factor 
of N, 
it also DIVIDES 
N. 
But 
a number 
which 
DIVIDES 
two numbers 
a and 
b < a also 
DIVIDES 
their 
difference 
a - b, so F must 
also divide 
N-(2&5* 
9 .p) = (2-3-S 
l l mp+1)-(2*3.5. 
. ‘p) = 1. (2) 
However, 
in order 
to divide 
1, F must 
be 1, which 
is 
contrary 
to the 
assumption 
that 
it is a PRIME 
in the 
sequence 
2, 3, 5, . . . . 
It 
therefore 
follows 
that 
if N 
is composite, 
it has at least 
one factor 
greater 
than 
p. 
Since N is either 
a PRIME 
greater 
than 
p or contains 
a 
factor 
greater 
than 
p, 
a PRIME 
larger 
than 
the largest 
in the finite 
sequence 
can always be found, 
so there 
are 
an infinite 
number 
of PRIMES. 
Hardy 
(1967) 
remarks 
that 
this 
proof 
is “as fresh and 
significant 
as when 
it 
was discovered” 
so that 
“two thousand 
years have not 
written 
a wrinkle” 
on it. 
A similar 
argument 
shows that 
p! & 1 is PRIME, 
and 
must 
be either 
PRIME 
or be divisible 
by a PRIME 
> p. 
Kummer 
used a variation 
of this 
proof, 
which 
is also a 
proof by contradiction. 
It assumes 
that 
there 
exist only 
a finite 
number 
of PRIMES 
N 
= pl, 
132, . . . , pT. 
Now 
consider 
N - 1. It must 
be a product 
of PRIMES, 
so it 
has a PRIME 
divisor 
p; in common 
with 
N. 
Therefore, 
piIN-(N-1) 
= 1 which is nonsense, 
so we have proved 
the initial 
assumption 
is wrong 
by contradiction. 
It is also true 
that 
there 
are runs of COMPOSITE 
NUM- 
BERS which 
are arbitrarily 
long. 
This 
can be seen by 
defining 
where j! 
is a FACTORIAL. 
Then 
the j - 1 consecutive 
numbers 
n + 2, n + 3, . . . , n +j 
are COMPOSITE, 
since 
J 
n E j! = rI 
i, 
-- 
z- 1 
(4) 
n+2=(1~2mmmj)+2=2(1~3~4m~~n+l) 
(5) 
n+3=(1.2...j)+3=3(1-2*4*5*han+l) 
(6) 
n+j=(1*2* 
l *j)+j=j[b2***(j-1)+1]. 
(7) 
Guy 
(1981, 
1988) points 
out that 
while plp2 
+ l yn + 1 is 
not necessarily 
PRIME, 
letting 
q be the next 
PRIME 
after 
plp2 
’ ’ 
l pn + 1, the number 
Q - plp2 . v l p, + 1 is almost 
always 
a PRIME, 
although 
it has not been 
proven 
that 
this must 
alurays be the case.

Euclidean 
Algorithm 
An ALGORITHM 
for finding 
the GREATEST 
COMMUN 
DI- 
VISOR 
of two numbers 
a and b, also called 
Euclid’s 
al- 
gorithm. 
It is an example 
of a P-PROBLEM 
whose time 
complexity 
is bounded 
by a quadratic 
function 
of the 
length 
of the input 
values 
(Banach 
and 
Shallit). 
Let 
a = bq + T, then 
find a number 
u which 
DIVIDES 
both 
a 
and b (so that 
a = su and b = tu), 
then 
u also DIVIDES 
T since 
r=a 
- 
bq 
= 
su 
- 
qtu = (s - q+. 
(1) 
Similarly, 
find 
a number 
w which 
DIVIDES 
b and T (so 
that 
b = s’v and T = t’v), then 
‘u DIVIDES 
a since 
a = bq + r = s’zlq + t’v = (s’q + t’)v. 
(2) 
Therefore, 
every common 
DIVISOR 
of a and b is a com- 
mon DIVISOR 
of b and T, so the procedure 
can be iterated 
as follows 
a = bql + TI

According 
to EULER'S ROTATION THEOREM, any Ro- 
TATION may 
be described 
using 
three ANGLES. If the 
ROTATIONS are written 
in terms 
of ROTATION MATRI- 
CES B, C, and D, then 
a general 
ROTATION A can be 
written 
as 
A = BCD. 
The 
three 
angles 
giving 
the three 
rotation 
matrices 
are 
called 
Euler 
angles. 
There 
are several 
conventions 
for 
Euler 
angles, 
depending 
on the 
axes about 
which 
the 
rotations 
are carried 
out.

Writing

gives 
X’ = AX 
(31) 
X/XT = AXXT, 
(32) 
and solving 
for A gives 
A = X’X’(XX’)-‘. 
(33) 
However, 
we want the angles 
8, 4, and @, not their 
com- 
binations 
contained 
in the MATRIX A. Therefore, 
write 
the 3 x 3 MATRIX 
as a 1 X~VECTOR 
Now set up the matrices 
Using NONLINEAR LEAST S QUARES FITTING then gives

PERMUTATIONS 
and are related 
to GENOC- 
CHINUMBERS. 
Thebaseeofthe

Some

for n = 2, 3, 19, 227, 255, . . . (Sloane’s

Euler Parameters 
Euler’s Polygun 
Division 
Problem 
Euler 
Parameters 
The four parameters 
eo, el, e2, and e3 describing 
a finite 
rotation 
about 
an arbitrary 
axis. 
The Euler 
parameters 
are defined 
by 
(1) 
(2) 
and are a QUATERNION in scalar-vector 
representation 
(eo, e) = e0 
+ 
elz 
+ 
e2j 
+ 
e3k. 
(3) 
Because 
EULER'S ROTATION THEOREM states 
that 
an 
arbitrary 
rotation 
may 
be described 
by only 
three 
pa- 
rameters, 
a relationship 
must 
exist 
between 
these 
four 
quantities 
e02+eae= 
eo2 + e12 + e22 + es2 = 1 
(4) 
(Goldstein 
1980, 
p. 153). 
The 
rotation 
angle 
is then 
related 
to the Euler 
parameters 
by 
cosg5=2e02-1=eo2 
-e.e 
= eo2 
2 
- el 
-ez2 
-ea2 
(5) 
kin4 
= 2eeo. 
(6) 
The Euler 
LERANGL 
may 
be given 
in terms 
of the EIJ- 
parameters 
ES by 
eo = cos[ i&5 + $)] 
COS( 
@) 
el = sin[$(4 
- $)I sin( $0) 
e2 = cos[ $(qb - T/J)] sin( $0) 
e3 = sin[ $ (4 + $)] cos( $0)

For technical 
reasons, 
Eulerian

are easier to study 
mathemat-

than 
are HAMILTONIAN

As a gener-

Euler 
showed 
(without

that 
a CONNECTED

Excision 
Axiom 
One of the EILENBERG-STEENROD AXIOMS whichstates 
that, 
if X is a SPACE with SUBSPACES A and U such that 
the CLOSURE of A is contained 
in the interior 
of U, then 
the INCLUSION MAP 
(X 
U, A U) -+ (X,A) 
induces 
an 
isomorphism 
Hn (X 
U, A U) + I&(X, 
A). 
Excluded 
Middle 
Law 
A law in (2-valued) 
LOGIC 
which states there 
is no third 
alternative 
to TRUTH or FALSEHOOD. In other 
words, 
every statement 
must 
be either 
A or not-A. 
This 
fact no 
longerholdsin 
THREE-VALUED LOGIC or FUZZY LOGIC. 
Excludent 
A method 
which 
can be used to solve any QUADRATIC 
CONGRUENCE. This 
technique 
relies 
on the 
fact that 
solving 
x2 E b (mod 
p) 
is equivalent 
to finding 
a value 
y such that 
b+py=x2. 
Pick 
a few small 
moduli 
m.. If y mod 
nz does not make 
b +py 
a quadratic 
residue 
of m, then 
this value of y may 
be excluded. 
Furthermore, 
values 
of y > p/4 
are never 
necessary. 
Excludent 
Factorization 
Method 
Also 
known 
as the 
difference 
of squares. 
It was first 
used by Fermat 
and improved 
by Gauss. 
Gauss 
looked 
for INTEGERS x and y satisfying 
y2 E x2 - IV (mod 
E) 
for various 
moduli 
E. 
This 
allowed 
the 
exclusion 
of 
many 
potential 
factors. 
This 
method 
works 
best when 
factors 
are of approximately 
the same size, so it is some- 
times 
better 
to attempt 
mlv 
for some 
suitably 
chosen 
value 
of nz.

Exponential 
Map 
On a LIE GROUP, 
exp is a MAP from 
the LIE ALGEBRA 
to its LIE GROUP. If you 
think 
of the LIE ALGEBRA as 
the TANGENT SPACE to the identity 
ofthe 
LIE GROUP, 
exp(w) 
is defined 
to be h(l), 
where 
h is the unique 
LIE 
GROUP HOMEOMORPHISM from the REAL NUMBERS to 
the LIE GROUP such that 
its velocity 
at time 
0 is zt. 
On a RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLD, exp is a MAP from 
the 
TANGENT BUNDLE of the MANIFOLDLY the MANIFOLD, 
and exp(w) is defined 
to be h(l), 
where h is the unique 
GEODESIC traveling 
through 
the base-point 
of w such 
that 
its velocity 
at time 
0 is zt. 
The 
three 
notions 
of exp (exp from 
COMPLEX ANALY- 
SIS, exp from 
LIE GROUPS, and exp from 
Riemannian 
geometry) 
are all linked 
together, 
the strongest 
link 
be- 
ing between 
the LIE GROUPS and Riemannian 
geometry 
definition. 
If G is a compact 
LIE GROUP, it admits 
a left 
and right 
invariant 
RIEMANNIAN METRIC. With 
respect, 
to that 
metric, 
the two exp maps agree on their 
common 
domain. 
In other 
words, 
one-parameter 
subgroups 
are 
geodesics. 
In the 
case of the MANIFOLD sl, the CIR- 
CLE, if we think 
of the tangent 
space to 1 as being 
the 
IMAGINARY axis (y-Ax~s)inthe 
COMPLEX PLANE, then

and so the three

all agree in 
this 
case.

Extreme 
Value 
Theorem 
If a function 
f is continuous 
on a closed 
interval 
[a, b], 
then 
f has both 
a MAXIMUM 
and a MINIMUM 
on [a, b]. 
If f has an extreme 
value 
on an open 
interval 
(a, b), 
then 
the extreme 
value 
occurs 
at a CRITICAL 
POINT. 
This 
theorem 
is sometimes 
also called 
the WEIERSTRAJ~ 
EXTREME 
VALUE 
THEOREM. 
Extremum 
A MAXIMUM 
or MINIMUM. 
An extremum 
may be LO- 
CAL (a.k.a. 
a RELATIVE 
EXTREMUM; 
an extremumin 
a 
given region 
which 
is not the overall 
MAXIMUM 
or MIN- 
IMUM) 
or GLOBAL. 
F’unctions 
with 
many 
extrema 
can 
be very difficult 
to GRAPH. 
Notorious 
examples 
include 
the functions 
cos(l/~) 
and sin(l/x) 
near x = 0 
and sin(e2x+g) 
T lear 0 and 1. 
The latter 
has

Extremum 
Test 
Consider 
a function 
j(z) 
in 1-D. If f(z) 
has a relative 
extremum 
at ~0, 
then 
either 
f’(q)) 
= 
0 or f is not 
DIFFERENTIABLE 
at 20. Either 
the first or second 
DE- 
RIVATIVE tests 
may 
be used to locate 
relative 
extrema 
of the first kind. 
A NECESSARY condition 
(MAXIMUM) 
at x0 is 
for f(z) 
to have 
a MINIMUM 
f’(xo) = 0, 
and 
f”(x0) 
2 0 
(f”(xo> 
I 0). 
A SUFFICIENT condition 
is I’ 
= 0 and f”(zco) 
> 0 
(f”(x0) 
< 
0). 
Let 
f’(x0) 
= 
0, f”(Xo> 
= 
0, 
. . . , 
f(“)(zo) 
= 0, but f@+‘) 
(x0) # 0. Then 
f(x) 
has a REL- 
ATIVE MAXIMUM at ~0 if n is ODD and f(n+l)(xo) 
< 0, 
and f(z) 
has a RELATIVE MINIMUM 
at x0 if n is ODD 
and f(n+l)(xo) 
> 0. Th ere is a SADDLE POINT at 20 if 
n is EVEN.

Factor 
A factor 
is a portion 
of a quantity, 
usually 
an INTE- 
GER or POLYNOMIAL. 
The 
determination 
of factors 
is 
called FACTORIZATION (or sometimes “FACTORING"). 
It 
is usually 
desired 
to break 
factors 
down into the smallest 
possible 
pieces so that 
no factor 
is itself 
factorable. 
For 
INTEGERS, 
the determination 
of factors 
is called 
PRIME 
FACTORIZATION. 
For large 
quantities, 
the determina- 
tion 
of all factors 
is usually 
very difficult 
except 
in ex- 
ceptional 
circumstances. 
As n grows large, 
factorials 
begin 
acquiring 
tails of trail- 
ing ZEROS. To calculate 
the number 
of trailing 
ZEROS 
for n!, use

Fallacy 
A fallacy 
is an incorrect 
result 
arrived 
at by appar- 
ently 
correct, 
though 
actually 
specious 
reasoning. 
The 
most 
common 
example 
of a mathematical 
fallacy 
is the 
“proof” 
that 
1 = 2 as follows. 
Let a = b, then 
ab = 2 
& - b2 = a2 - b2 
b(a - b) = (a + b)(a - b) 
b=a+b 
b = 2b 
1 = 
2. 
The incorrect 
step is division 
by a - b (equal 
to 0), which 
is invalid. 
Ball 
and Coxeter 
(1987) 
give other 
such ex- 
amples 
in the areas of both 
arithmetic 
and geometry.

The 
2-D 
PROJECTIVE 
PLANE 
over 
GF(2) 
(“of 
order 
two”), 
illustrated 
above. 
It is a BLOCK DESIGN with 
Y = 7, k = 3, X = 1, r = 3, and b = 7, and is also the 
STEINER 
TRIPLE 
SYSTEM 
S(7). 
The 
Fano 
plane 
also solves 
the TRANSYLVANIA LOT- 
TERY, 
which 
picks 
three 
numbers 
from 
the INTEGERS 
1-14. 
Using 
two Fano 
planes 
we can guarantee 
match- 
ing two by playing 
just 
14 times 
as follows. 
Label 
the 
VERTICES of one Fano plane 
by the INTEGERS 1-7, the 
other 
plane 
by the INTEGERS 8-14. 
The 
14 tickets 
to 
play 
are the 14 lines of the two planes. 
Then 
if (a, b, c) 
is the winning 
ticket, 
at least two of a, b, c are either 
in 
the interval 
[l, 71 or [8, 141. These 
two numbers 
are on 
exactly 
one line 
of the 
corresponding 
plane, 
so one of 
our tickets 
matches 
them.

There 
is always an ODD 
number 
of terms, 
and the mid- 
dle term 
is always 
l/2. 
Let p/q, p’/q’, 
and p”/q” 
be 
three 
successive 
terms 
in a Farey

Then 
The 
Lehmers 
(1974) 
found 
an application 
of the Fano 
plane 
for factoring 
INTEGERS via QUADRATIC FORMS. 
Here, 
the 
triples 
of forms 
used 
form 
the 
lines 
of 
the PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY on seven 
points, 
whose 
planes 
are Fano configurations 
corresponding 
to pairs of 
residue 
classes mod 
24 (Lehmer 
and Lehmer 
1974, Guy 
1975, 
Shanks 
1985). 
The 
group 
of AUTOMORPHISMS 
(incidence-preserving 
BIJECTIONS) 
of the Fano plane 
is 
the SIMPLE 
GROUP 
of ORDER 
168 (Klein 
1870).

Fast Fourier 
Transform 
The fast Fourier 
transform 
(FFT) 
is a DISCRETE FOUR- 
IER TRANSFORM 
ALGORITHM 
which 
reduces 
the num- 
ber of computations 
needed 
for N points 
from 
2N2 
to 
2Nlg 
N, 
where 
LG is the 
base-2 
LOGARITHM. 
If the 
function 
to be transformed 
is not 
harmonically 
related 
to the sampling 
frequency, 
the response 
of an FFT 
looks 
like a SING FUNCTION (although 
the integrated 
POWER 
is still correct). 
ALIASING (LEAKAGE) can be reduced 
by 
APODIZATION using 
a TAPERING FUNCTION. However, 
ALIASING reduction 
is at the expense 
of broadening 
the 
spectral 
response. 
FFTs 
were first discussed 
by Cooley 
and Tukey 
(1965), 
although 
Gauss 
had actually 
described 
the critical 
fac- 
torization 
step as early 
as 1805 (Gergkand 
1969, Strang 
1993). 
A DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM can 
be 
computed 
using 
an FFT 
by means 
of the DANIELSON- 
LANCZOS 
LEMMA if the number 
of points 
N is a POWER 
of two. 
If the number 
of points 
Iv is not a POWER of 
two, a transform 
can be performed 
on sets of points 
cor- 
responding 
to the prime 
factors 
of N which 
is slightly 
degraded 
in speed. 
An efficient 
real 
Fourier 
transform 
algorithm 
or a fast HARTLEY TRANSFORM (Bracewell 
1965) gives a further 
increase 
in speed by approximately 
a factor 
of two. 
Base-4 
and base-8 
fast Fourier 
trans- 
forms 
use optimized 
code, 
and 
can be 20-30% 
faster 
than 
base-2 
fast Fourier 
transforms. 
PRIME factoriza- 
tion is slow when the factors 
are large, 
but discrete 
Four- 
ier transforms 
can be made 
fast for 1v = 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 
8, 11, 13, and 
16 using 
the WINOGRAD TRANSFORM 
ALGORITHM (Press 
et al. 
1992, pp. 412-413, 
Arndt). 
Fast 
Fourier 
transform 
algorithms 
generally 
fall 
into 
two classes: 
decimation 
in time, 
and decimation 
in fre- 
quency. 
The 
Cooley-Tukey 
FFT 
ALGORITHM first 
re- 
arranges 
the input 
elements 
in bit-reversed 
order, 
then 
builds 
the output 
transform 
(d.ecimation 
in time). 
The 
f n+l 
= 
Xfn 
+ 
yfn-1, 
(1) 
define 
a multiplication 
rule on ordered 
pairs by 
(A, B)(C, 
D) = (AD 
+ BC + xAC, BD 
+ yAC). 
(2) 

Fast Fourier 
lkansform 
Fatou’s Theorems 
basic 
idea 
is to break 
up a transform 
of length 
Iv into 
two transforms 
of length

sometimes 
called 
the 
DANIELSON-LANCZOS 
LEMMA. 
The 
easiest 
way to visualize 
this 
procedure 
is perhaps 
via the FOURIER MATRIX. 
The 
Sande-Tukey 
ALGORITHM 
(Stoer 
and 
Burlisch 
1980) first transforms, 
then rearranges 
the output 
values 
(decimation 
in frequency).

Feigenbaum 
Constant 
A universal 
constant 
for functions 
approaching 
CHAOS 
via period 
doubling. 
It was discovered 
by Feigenbaum 
in 1975 and demonstrated 
rigorously 
by Lanford 
(1982) 
and Collet 
and Eckmann 
(1979, 
1980). 
The Feigenbaum 
constant 
S characterizes 
the geometric 
approach 
of the 
bifurcation 
parameter 
to its limiting 
value. 
Let pk be 
the point 
at which 
a period 
2k cycle becomes 
unstable.

where 
I? is 
for 6 gives 
a constant 
and 6 is a constant 
(Rasband 
1990, p* 23). For the LOGISTIC 
EQUATION, 
6 = 4.669216091..

Amazingly, 
the Feigenbaum 
constant 
S ==: 4.669 is “uni- 
versal” 
(i.e., the same) 
for all 1-D MAPS f(z) if f(z) 
has 
a single 
locally 
quadratic 
MAXIMUM. 
More 
specifically, 
the 
Feigenbaum 
constant 
is universal

Examples 
of maps 
which 
are universal 
in- 
clude 
the H~NON MAP, LOGISTIC MAP, LORENZ SYS- 
TEM, Navier-Stokes 
truncations, 
and sine map 
x=+1 
= 
a sin(;rrx,). 
The 
value 
of the Feigenbaum 
constant 
can 
be computed 
explicitly 
using functional 
group 
renormal- 
ization 
theory. 
The 
universal 
constant 
also occurs 
in 
phase transitions 
in physics 
and, curiously, 
is very nearly 
equal 
to 
7r+tan-l 
(eT) = 4.669201932, 
. . .

The 
CIRCLE 
MAP is not universal, 
and has a Feigenbaum 
constant 
of 6 ==: 2.833.

the 
l?eigenbaum 
constant 
is 6 = 0.7210978..

For a function 
of the form 
f(x) 
= 1 - alxln 
(10) 
with 
a and 72 constant 
and 
n an INTEGER, the Feigen- 
baum 
constant 
for various 
n is given 
in the 
following 
table 
(Briggs 
1991, 
Briggs 
et al. 1991), 
which 
updates 
the values 
in Tabor 
(1989, 
pm 225). 
An additional 
constant 
a, defined 
as the separation 
of 
adjacent 
elements 
of PERIOD DOUBLED ATTRACTORS 
from 
one double 
to the next, 
has a value

(11) 
n+m 
n+l 
for “universal”

renormal-

to the zeroth

by

T6th’s 
Problem 
How can n points 
be distributed 
on a UNIT 
SPHERE 
such 
that 
they 
maximize 
the minimum 
distance 
between 
any 
pair 
of points ? In 1943, 
Fejes T&h 
proved 
that 
for Iv 
points, 
there 
always 
exist 
two points 
whose distance 
d 
I 
d< 
/4-csc2 
[6C;;2,1, 
and that 
the limit 
is exact 
for N = 3, 4, 6, and 12. 
For two points, 
the points 
should 
be at opposite 
ends of 
a DIAMETER. 
For four points, 
they 
should 
be placed 
at 
the VERTICES 
of an inscribed 
TETRAHEDRON. 
There 
is 
no best solution 
for five points 
since the distance 
can- 
not be reduced 
below 
that 
for six points. 
For six points, 
they 
should 
be placed 
at the VERTICES 
of an inscribed 
OCTAHEDRON. 
For seven points, 
the 
best 
solution 
is 
four 
equilateral 
spherical 
triangles 
with 
angles 
of 80’. 
For eight 
points, 
the best dispersal 
is not the VERTICES 
of the inscribed 
CUBE, 
but of a square 
ANTIPRISM 
with 
equal 
EDGES. 
The solution 
for nine points 
is eight 
equi- 
lateral 
spherical 
triangles 
with angles of cos-1 (l/4). 
For 
12 points, 
the solution 
is an inscribed 
ICOSAHEDRON.

problem

Fermat’s 
Last Theorem 
Fermat’s 
Factorization 
Method 
Given 
a number 
n, look 
for INTEGERS II= and y such that 
n =x2-y2. 
Then 
n = (x - Y>(X + Y> 
(1) 
and n is factored. 
Any ODD NUMBER can be represented 
in this 
form 
since then 
n = ab, a and b are ODD, 
and 
x $ ky 
(mod 
n). 
It turns 
out that 
if n is ODD and DI- 
VISIBLE by at least two different 
PRIMES, then 
at least 
half of the solutions 
to x2 E y2 (mod 
n) with 
xy CO- 
PRIME 
to n are interesting. 
For such solutions, 
(n, x - y) 
is neither 
n nor 1 and is therefore 
a nontrivial 
factor 
of 
n (Pomerance 
1996). 
This ALGORITHM can be used to 
prove 
primality, 
but 
is not practical. 
In 
1931, Lehmer 
and Powers discovered 
how to search for such pairs using 
CONTINUED FRACTIONS. 
This 
method

Fermat’s 
Last 
Theorem 
A theorem 
first 
proposed 
by Fermat 
in the 
form 
of a 
note 
scribbled 
in the margin 
of his copy of the ancient 
Greek 
text 
Arithmetica 
by Diophantus. 
The 
scribbled 
note 
was discovered 
posthumously, 
and 
the original 
is 
now lost. 
However, 
a copy was preserved 
in a book 
pub- 
lished 
by Fermat’s 
son. In the note, 
Fermat 
claimed 
to 
have discovered 
a proof 
that 
the DIOPHANTINE EQUA-

Continue 
with

that 
the restriction

since there are a number

of PYTHAGOREAN

(x, y, z) satisfying 
the equation 
for rz = 2,

A first 
attempt 
to solve the equation 
can be made 
by 
attempting 
to factor 
the equation, 
giving 
( z 42 + yn/2)(2n/2

= 2n*

However, 
since solutions 
to these equations 
in RATIONAL 
NUMBERS 
are no easier 
to find 
than 
solutions 
to the 
original 
equation, 
this approach 
unfortunately 
does not 
provide 
any additional 
insight. 
It is sufficient

The 
so-called 
“first

of the 
theorem 
is for expo- 
nents 
which 
are RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to 2, y, and 
z 
(fix, 
y, x) and was considered 
by Wieferich. 
Sophie 
Ger- 
main 
proved 
the first case of Fermat’s 
Last Theorem 
for 
any ODD PRIME 
p when 2p+ 
1 is also a PRIME. 
Legen- 
dre subsequently 
proved 
that 
if p is a PRIME 
such that 
4p + 1, 8p + 1, 10~ + 1, 14~ + 1, or 16~ + 1 is also a 
PRIME, 
then 
the first 
case of Fermat’s 
Last 
Theorem 
holds for p. This 
established 
Fermat’s 
Last Theorem 
for 
p < 100. 
In 1849, Kummer 
proved 
it for all REGULAR 
PRIMES 
and 
COMPOSITE 
NUMBERS 
of which 
they 
are 
factors 
(Vandiver 
1929, Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
Kummer’s 
attack 
led to the theory 
of IDEALS, 
and Van- 
diver 
developed 
VANDIVER'S 
CRITERIA 
for deciding 
if 
a given 
IRREGULAR 
PRXME 
satisfies 
the theorem. 
Gen- 
occhi 
(1852) 
proved 
that 
the first 
case is true 
for p if 
(p,p 
- 3) is not an IRREGULAR 
PAIR. 
In 
1858, Kum- 
mer showed that 
the first case is true 
if either 
(p,p - 3) 
or CP,P--5) 
is an IRREGULAR 
PAIR, 
which 
was subse- 
quently 
extended 
to include 
(p, p - 7) and 
(p, p - 9) by 
Mirimanoff 
(1905). 
Wieferich 
(1909) 
proved 
that 
if the 
equation 
is solved 
in integers 
RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to an 
ODD PRIME 
p, then 
2’-l 
= 1 (mod 
p”) . 
- 
(9) 
(Ball 
and 
Coxeter 
1987). 
Such 
numbers 
are called 
WIEFERICH 
PRIMES. 
Mirimanoff 
(1909) 
subsequently 
showed that 
3’4 
- - - 
1 (mod 
p”) 
(10) 
must 
also hold 
for solutions 
RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to an 
ODD PRIME 
p, which 
excludes 
the first two WIEFERICH 
PRIMES 
1093 and 3511. 
Vandiver 
(1914) 
showed 
5’-l

extended 
this 
to

G 1 (modp2), 
(13) 
which raised 
the smallest 
possible 
p in the “first 
case” to 
253,747,889 
by 1941 (Rosser 
1941). 
Granville 
and Mon- 
agan (1988) 
showed 
if there 
exists a PRIME 
p satisfying 
Fermat’s 
Last 
Theorem, 
then 
p-l 
- 
Q 
= 1 (mod 
p”) 
(14) 
for 
q 
= 
5, 7, 
11, 
l , . , 71. 
This 
establishes 
that 
the 
first 
case is true 
for 
all 
PRIME 
exponents 
up to 
714,591,416,091,398 
(Vardi 
1991). 
The 
“second 
case” 
of Fermat’s 
Last 
Theorem 
(for 
plx, y, z) proved 
harder 
than 
the first case. 
Euler 
proved 
the general 
case of the theorem 
for n = 3, 
Fermat 
n = 4, Dirichlet 
and Lagrange 
n = 5. In 1832, 
Dirichlet 
established 
the case n = 14. 
The 
n = 7 case 
was proved 
by Lam6 
(1839), 
using 
the identity 
(X+Y+z)7-(X7+Y7+27) 
= 7(X 
+ Y)(X 
+ Z)(Y 
+ 2) 
x[(x2+Y2+z2+xY+xz+Y~)2 
+ XYZ(X 
+ Y + Z)]. 
(15) 
Although 
some 
errors 
were present 
in this 
proof, 
these 
were subsequently 
fixed 
by Lebesgue 
(1840). 
Much 
ad- 
ditional 
progress 
was made 
over the next 
150 years, but 

Fermat ‘s Last 
Theorem 
Fermat ‘s Last 
Theorem 
619 
no completely 
general 
result 
had been obtained. 
Buoyed 
by false confidence 
after his proof 
that 
PI is TRANSCEN- 
DENTAL, the 
mathematician 
Lindemann 
proceeded 
to 
publish 
several 
proofs 
of Fermat’s 
Last 
Theorem, 
all of 
them 
invalid 
(Bell 
1937, pp. 464-465). 
A prize of 100,000 
German 
marks 
(known 
as the Wolfskel 
Prize) 
was also 
offered 
for the first valid 
proof 
(Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987, 
p* 72). 
A recent 
false alarm 
for a general 
proof 
was raised 
by 
Y. Miyaoka 
(Cipra 
1988) 
whose proof, 
however, 
turned 
out 
to be flawed. 
Other 
attempted 
proofs 
among 
both 
professional 
and amateur 
mathematicians 
are discussed 
by vos Savant 
(1993), 
although 
vos Savant 
erroneously 
claims 
that 
work 
on the problem 
by Wiles 
(discussed 
below) 
is invalid. 
By the time 
1993 rolled 
around, 
the 
general 
case of Fermat’s 
Last Theorem 
had been shown 
to be true 
for all exponents 
up to 4 x lo6 (Cipra 
1993). 
However, 
given 
that 
a proof 
of Fermat’s 
Last 
Theo- 
rem 
requires 
truth 
for all exponents, 
proof 
for any fi- 
nite 
number 
of exponents 
does not 
constitute 
any sig- 
nificant 
progress 
towards 
a proof 
of the general 
theorem 
(although 
the fact that 
no counterexamples 
were found 
for this many 
cases is highly 
suggestive). 
In 
1993, 
a bombshell 
was dropped. 
In 
that 
year, 
the 
general 
theorem 
was partially 
proven 
by Andrew 
Wiles 
(Cipra 
1993, 
Stewart 
1993) 
by 
proving 
the 
SEMISTABLE case ofthe 
TANIYAMA-SHIMURA 
C~NJEC- 
TURE. Unfortunately, 
several 
holes 
were discovered 
in 
the proof 
shortly 
thereafter 
when Wiles’ 
approach 
via 
the TANIYAMA-SHIMURA 
CONJECTURE became 
hung 
up 
on properties 
of the 
SELMER 
GROUP 
using 
a tool called 
an “Euler 
system.” 
However, 
the difficulty 
was circum- 
vented 
by Wiles 
and R. Taylor 
in late 
1994 (Cipra 
1994, 
1995ab) 
and published 
in Taylor 
and Wiles 
(1995) 
and 
Wiles 
(1995). 
Wiles’ 
proof 
succeeds 
by (1) replacing 
ELLIPTIC 
CURVES 
with 
Galois 
representations, 
(2) re- 
ducing 
the problem 
to a CLASS NUMBER 
FORMULA, 
(3) 
proving 
that 
FORMULA, 
and (4) tying 
up loose ends that 
arise because 
the formalisms 
fail in the simplest 
degen- 
erate 
cases (Cipra 
1995a). 
The proof 
of Fermat’s 
Last Theorem 
marks 
the end of a 
mathematical 
era. Since virtually 
all of the tools which 
were eventually 
brought 
to bear on the problem 
had yet 
to be invented 
in the time 
of Fermat, 
it is interesting 
to 
speculate 
about 
whether 
he actually 
was in possession 
of an elementary 
proof 
of the theorem. 
Judging 
by the 
temerity 
with 
which 
the problem 
resisted 
attack 
for so 
long, 
Fer-mat ‘s alleged 
proof 
seems likely 
to have been 
illusionary.

‘s Lesser 
Theorem 
see FERMAT'S LITTLE THEOREM 
Fermat’s 
Little 
Theorem 
Ifp 
is a PRIME number 
and a a NATURAL NUMBER, 
then 
up E a (mod p) . 
(1) 
Furthermore, 
if ~$a 
(p 
does not 
divide 
a), then 
there 
exists some smallest 
exponent 
d such that 
ud -1~0 
(modp) 
and d divides 
p - 
1. Hence, 
(2) 
g--l 
- 1 - = 0 (mod p) . 
(3) 
This 
is a generalization 
of the CHINESE HYPOTHESIS 
and a special 
case of EULER'S THEOREM. It is sometimes 
called 
FERMAT'S PRIMALITY TEST andisa 
NECESSARY 
but 
not SUFFICIENT test for primality. 
Although 
it was 
presumably 
proved 
(but suppressed) 
by Fermat, 
the first 
proof 
was published 
by Euler 
in 1749. 
The 
theorem 
is easily 
proved 
using 
mathematical 
IN- 
DUC TION. Suppose 
plap - a. Then 
examine 
Fermat ‘s Lit tie Theorem 
(a + 1)” - (a + I)* 
From 
the BINOMIAL THEOREM, 
(u+l)P=up+($f-~+(;)up-~+... 
Rewriting, 
+ 
. . 
(4 
P ( > 
p-1 
u+lm 
(5) 
.+ 
p 
( 
> 
p-l 
a. 
(6) 
But p divides 
the right 
side, 
so it also divides 
the left 
side. 
Combining 
with 
the induction 
hypothesis 
gives 
that p divides 
the sum 
[(a + 1)” - up - l] + (UP - a) = (a + 1)” - (CL + l), 
(7) 
as assumed, 
so the hypothesis 
is true 
for any a. 
The 
theorem 
is sometimes 
called 
FERMAT'S SIMPLE THEO- 
REM. WILSON'S THEOREM follows 
as a COROLLARY of 
Fermat’s 
Little 
Theorem. 
Fermat’s 
little 
theorem 
shows that, 
if p is PRIME, there 
does not exists 
a base a < p with 
(a,~) = 1 such that 
up--l - I possesses a nonzero 
residue 
modulo 
p. If such 
base a exists, 
p is therefore 
guaranteed 
to be compos- 
ite. 
However, 
the lack 
of a nonzero 
residue 
in Fermat’s 
little 
theorem 
does not guarantee 
that p is PRIME. The 
property 
of unambiguously 
certifying 
composite 
num- 
bers while 
passing 
some 
PRIMES make 
Fermat’s 
little 
theorem 
a COMPOSITENESS TEST which 
is sometimes 
calledthe 
FERMAT COMPOSITENESS TEST. COMPOSITE 
NUMBERS knownas 
FERMAT PSEUDOPRIMES (orsome- 
times 
simply 
"PSEUDOPRIMES") have 
zero residue 
for 
some 
as and so are not 
identified 
as composite. 
Worse 
still, 
there 
exist 
numbers 
known 
as CARMICHAEL NUM- 
BERS (the 
smallest 
of which 
is 561) 
which 
give 
zero 
residue 
for any choice 
of the base a RELATIVELY PRIME 
top. However, 
FERMAT'S LITTLETHEOREM 
CONVERSE 
provides 
a criterion 
for certifying 
the primality 
of a num- 
ber. 
A number 
satisfying 
Fermat’s 
little 
theorem 
for some 
nontrivial 
base and which 
is not known 
to be composite 
is called 
a PROBABLE PRIME. 
A table 
of the 
small- 
est PSEUDOPRIMES P for the first 
100 bases 
u follows 
(Sloane’s 
AOO7535).

Converse 
The 
converse 
of FERMAT'S LITTLE 
THEOREM is also 
known 
as LEHMER'S THEOREM. 
It 
states 
that, 
if an 
INTEGER II: is PRIME to vz and 
xrn-’ 
= 
1 (mod 
m) 
and 
there 
is no INTEGER 
e < m - 1 for which 
xe = 
1 (mod 
m), 
then 
m is PRIME. 
Here, 
2 is called 
a WIT- 
NESS to the primality 
of m.

A BINOMIAL NUMBER of the form 
F, 
= 22n + 1. The 
first 
few for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . are 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, 
4294967297, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A000215). 
The 
number 
of 
DIGITS for a Fermat 
number 
is 
D(n) 
= [[10g(2~” 
+ I)] + 1J Z [log(22”) 
+ lj 
= 12” log 2 + 11. 
(1) 
Being 
a Fermat 
number 
is the NECESSARY (but not SUF- 
FICIENT) form 
a number 
Nn = 2” + 1 
(2) 
must 
have in order 
to be PRIME. This 
can be seen by 
noting 
that 
if IV= = 2n + 1 is to be PRIME, then n cannot 
have any ODD factors 
b or else N, 
would 
be a factorable 
number 
of the form 
2n + 1 = (2”)b + 1 
= (2” + 1)[2++ 
- 2”@-2) 
+ 2”(b-3) 
- 
, 
. 
l + 11. 
(3) 
Therefore, 
for a PRIME 
Nn, 
n must 
be a POWER 
of 2. 
Fermat 
conjectured 
in 1650 that 
every Fermat 
number 
is PRIME, but 
only 
COMPOSITE Fermat 
numbers 
Fn 
are known 
for n 2 5. 
Eisenstein 
(1844) 
proposed 
as 
a problem 
the proof 
that 
there 
are an infinite 
number 
of Fermat 
primes 
(Ribenboim 
1996, p. 88), but this has 
not yet been achieved. 
An anonymous 
writer 
proposed 
that 
numbers 
of the form 
22 + 1, 222 + 1, 22 
22 
+ 1 were 
PRIME. However, 
this conjecture 
was refuted 
when Sel- 
fridge 
(1953) 
showed that 
22 
fi6 
= p0 
+ 1= 
222 
+ 1 
(4) 
is COMPOSITE (Ribenboim 
1996, p. 88). Numbers 
of the 
form 
a2n + b2n are called 
generalized 
Fermat 
numbers 
(Ribenboim 
1996, pp. 359-360). 
Fermat 
numbers 
satisfy 
the RECURRENCE RELATION 
Fn can be shown 
to be PRIME iff it satisfies 
P~PIN'S 
TEST 
3(%-W 
= - -1 
(mod 
Fn).

E -1 
(mod

(7) 
is also NECESSARY 
and 
SUFFICIENT. 
In 1770, Euler 
showed that 
any FACTOR 
of Fn must 
have 
the form 
2 n+1K 
+ 1, 
(8) 
where 
K 
is a POSITIVE 
INTEGER. 
In 
1878, 
Lucas 
in- 
creased the exponent 
of 2 by one, showing 
that FACTORS 
of Fermat 
numbers 
must 
be of the form 
2 n+ZL + 1. 
(9) 
If 
F=plpz-pr 
is the factored 
part 
of F, = FC 
(where C is the cofactor 
to be tested 
for primality), 
compute 
A= 
3Fn-1 (mod 
Fn) 
B s 3F-1 (mod 
F,-J 
R=A-B 
(modC). 
(11) 
(12) 
(13) 
Then 
if R = 0, the cofactor 
is a PROBABLE 
PRIME 
to 
the base 3F; otherwise 
C is COMPOSITE. 
In order 
for a POLYGON 
to be circumscribed 
about 
a 
CIRCLE 
(i.e., 
a CONSTRUCTIBLE 
POLYGON), 
it must 
have a number 
of sides N given 
by 
IV = 2kFo..m Fn, 
(14) 
where the F, are distinct 
Fermat 
primes. 
This 
is equiv- 
alent 
to 
the 
statement 
that 
the 
trigonometric 
func- 
tions 
sin( k7$V), 
cos@r/N), 
etc., 
can be computed 
in 
terms 
of finite 
numbers 
of additions, 
multiplications, 
and square 
root 
extractions 
iff N is of the above 
form.

Fermat 
PRIMES 
are

Fz =5 
F2 = 17 
Fa = 257 
5'4 = 65537 
and it seems unlikely 
that 
any more 
exist. 
Factoring 
Fermat 
numbers 
is extremely 
difficult 
as a re- 
sult of their 
large size. In fact, only F5 to Fl1 have been 
complete 
factored,

in the following

Fermat’s 
Polygonal 
Number 
Theorem 
In 1638, Fermat 
proposed 
that 
every POSITIVE INTEGER 
is a sum of at most three TRIANGULAR NUMBERS, four 
SQUARE NUMBERS, five PENTAGONAL NUMBERS, and 
n ~-POLYGONAL NUMBERS. Fermat 
claimed 
to have a 
proof 
of this result, 
although 
Fermat’s 
proof 
has never 
been found. 
Gauss proved 
the triangular 
case, and noted 
the event in his diary 
on July 
10, 1796, with the notation 
* * EYRHKA 
num 
=A+A+A. 
This 
case is equivalent 
to the statement 
that 
every num- 
ber of the form 
8m + 3 is a sum of three ODD SQUARES 
(Duke 
1997). 
M ore specifically, 
a number 
is a sum of 
three SQUARES IFF it is not of the form 
4b(8m 
+ 7) for 
b > 0, as first proved 
by Legendre 
in 1798. 
- 
Euler 
was unable 
to prove 
the square 
case of Fermat’s 
theorem, 
but 
he left 
partial 
results 
which 
were subse- 
quently 
used by Lagrange. 
The 
square 
case was finally 
proved 
by Jacobi 
and 
independently 
by Lagrange 
in 
1772. 
It is therefore 
sometimes 
known 
as LAGRANGE'S 
FOUR-SQUARE THEOREM. In 1813, 
Cauchy 
proved 
the 
proposition 
in its entirety.

COMPOSITE NUMBER n such that

( i.e., 
it 
satisfies 
FERMAT'S LITTLE 
THEOREM, some- 
times 
with the requirement 
that 
rz must be ODD; 
Pomer- 
ante 
et al. 1980). 
psp(2) s are called 
POULET NUMBERS 
or, less commonly, 
SARRUS NUMBERS or FERMATIANS 
(Shanks 
1993). 
The 
first few EVEN psp(2)s 
(including 
the PRIME 2 as a pseudoprime) 
are 2, 161038,

If base 3 is used in addition 
to base 2 to weed out 
po- 
tential 
COMPOSITE NUMBERS, only 
4709 COMPOSITE 
NUMBERS remain 
< 25 x 10’.

An ARCHIMEDEAN SPIRAL with 
m 
= 
2 having 
polar 
equation 
T = &2, 
discussed 
by Fermat 
in 1636 (MacTutor 
Archive). 
It is 
also known 
as the PARABOLIC SPIRAL. For any given 
POSITIVE value of 8, there 
are two corresponding 
values 
of r of opposite 
signs. 
The 
resulting 
spiral 
is therefore 
symmetrical 
about 
the line y = --2. The CURVATURE is

Bundle 
A fiber 
bundle 
(also 
called 
simply 
a BUNDLE) 
with 
FIBER 
F is a MAP 
f : E + 
B where E is called 
the TO- 
TAL SPACE of the fiber 
bundle 
and 
B the BASE 
SPACE 
of the fiber bundle. 
The 
main 
condition 
for the MAP 
to 
be a fiber bundle 
is that 
every point 
in the BASE 
SPACE 
b E B has a NEIGHBORHOOD 
U such that 
f-‘(U) 
is 
HOMEOMORPHIC 
to U x F in a special 
way. Namely, 
if 
h : f-‘(U) 
+ W x F 
is the HOMEOMORPHISM, 
then 
w& 
O h = flf-qu)p 
where the MAP projU 
means 
projection 
onto the U com- 
ponent. 
The 
homeomorphisms 
h which 
“commute 
with 
projection” 
are called 
local 
TRIVIALIZATIONS 
for the 
fiber 
bundle 
f. In other 
words, E looks 
like the product 
B x F (at least locally), 
except 
that 
the fibers 
f-l(~) 
for LC E B may be a bit 
“twisted.” 
Examples 
of fiber bundles 
include 
any product 
B x F -+ 
B (which 
is a bundle 
over B with 
FIBER 
F), the MOBIUS 
STRIP 
(which 
is a fiber 
bundle 
:over the 
CIRCLE 
with 
FIBER 
given 
by the 
unit 
interval 
[OJ]; 
i.e, the 
BASE 
SPACE is the CIRCLE), 
and s3 (which 
is a bundle 
over s2 
with fiber S’). 
A special 
class of fiber bundle 
is the VEC- 
TOR BUNDLE, 
in which 
the FIBER 
is a VECTOR

For 
a discussion 
of SQUARE 
Fibonacci

see 
Cohn 
(1964), 
who proved 
that 
the only 
SQUARE 
NUM- 
BER Fibonacci 
numbers 
are 1 and Fl2 = 144 (Cohn 
1964, 
Guy 
1994). 
Ming 
(1989) 
p roved 
that 
the only 
TRIAN- 
GULAR 
Fibonacci 
numbers 
are 1, 3, 21, and 
55. 
The 
Fibonacci 
and LUCAS 
NUMBERS 
have no common 
terms 
except 
1 and 3. The only 
CUBIC 
Fibonacci 
numbers 
are 
1 and 8.

In 1975, James 
P. Jones showed that 
the Fibonacci 
num- 
bers arethe 
POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
valuesofthe 
POLYNOM- 
P(X,Y> 
= -y5 + 2y4x + y3x2 - 2y2x3 - y(x4 - 2) (56) 
for GAUSSIAN 
INTEGERS 
x and y (Le Lionnais 
1983). 
If 
n and k are two POSITIVE 
INTEGERS, 
then 
between 
nk 
and nk+‘, 
there 
can never occur 
more 
than 
n Fibonacci 
numbers 
(Honsberger 
1985, pp. 104-105). 
Every 
Fn that 
is PRIME 
has a PRIME 
n, but the converse 
is not necessarily 
true. 
The 
first 
few PRIME 
Fibonacci 
numbers 
are for n = 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 29, 43, 
47, 83, 131, 137, 359, 431, 433, 449, 509, 569, 571,

(Sloane’s 
A001605; 
Dubner

Gardner’s 
statement 
that 
F 531 is prime 
is incorrect, 
especially 
since 
531 is not even PRIME 
(Gardner 
1979, p. 161). 
It is not 
known 
if there 
are an INFINITE 
number 
of Fibonacci 
primes.

Fibonacci 
Polynomial 
8- 
The W POLYNOMIALS obtained 
by setting 
p(x) 
= x and 
cl(x) = 1 in the LUCAS POLYNOMIAL SEQUENCE. (The 
corresponding 
20 POLYNOMIALS 
are called LUCAS POLY- 
NOMIALS.) 
The 
Fibonacci 
polynomials 
are defined 
by 
the RECURRENCE RELATION 
F n+1

( 
> = 
x&-t(x) 
+ 
K-I(X),

with 
FI (x) = 1 and F&c)

are also given 
by 
the explicit 
sum formula

where 
1x1 is the FLOOR 
FUNCTION 
and

is a BINO- 
MIAL COEFFICIENT. 
The 
first few Fibonacci 
polynomi- 
als are

F4 (4

The 
Fibonacci 
polynomials 
are normalized 
so that 
F,(l) 
= 
F72,

where the Fns are FIBONACCI NUMBERS. 
The Fibonacci

Fibonacci 
Pseudoprime 
Consider 
a LUCAS SEQUENCE with 
P > 0 and Q = &l. 
A Fibonacci 
pseudoprime 
is a COMPOSITE NUMBER n 
such that 
Vn E P 
(mod 
n) . 
There 
exist 
no EVEN Fibonacci 
pseudoprimes 
with

rameters 
P = 1 and 
Q = -1 
(IX

or P = 
Q = 
1 ( AndrMeannin

And&-

Fibration 
If f : E + 
B is a FIBER 
BUNDLE 
with 
B a PARACOM- 
PACT TOPOLOGICAL 
SPACE, then 
f satisfies 
the HOMO- 
TOPY 
LIFTING 
PROPERTY 
with respect 
to all TOPOLOG- 
ICAL SPACES. 
In other 
words, 
if g : [0, l] x X -+ B is 
a HOMOTOPY 
from 
go to 91, and if gb is a LIFT 
of the 
MAP 
go with respect 
to f, then 
g has a LIFT 
to a MAP 
g’ with 
respect 
to f. 
Therefore, 
if you have a HOMO- 
TOPY of a MAP 
into 
B, and if the beginning 
of it has a 
LIFT, 
then 
that 
LIFT 
can be extended 
to a LIFT 
of the 
HOMOTOPY 
itself. 
A fibration 
is a MAP 
between 
TOPOLOGICAL 
SPACES 
f : E -+ B such that 
it satisfies 
the HOMOTOPY 
LIFTING 
PROPERTY.

Field 
A field 
is any set of elements 
which 
sat\. 
the 
FIELD 
AXIOMS 
for both 
addition 
and multiplica‘ 
* In and is a 
commutative 
DIVISION 
ALGEBRA. 
An archaic 
word for 
a field is RATIONAL 
DOMAIN. 
A field with 
a finite 
num- 
ber of members 
is known 
as a FINITE 
FIET 7 
r GALOIS 
FIELD. 
Because 
the identity 
condition 
must 
be different 
for ad- 
dition 
and multiplication, 
every field must 
have at least 
two elements. 
Examples 
include 
the 
COMPLEX 
NUM- 
BERS (c), 
RATIONAL 
NUMBERS 
(Q), 
and REAL 
NUM- 
BERS 
(R), 
but 
not the 
INTEGERS 
(Z), 
which 
form 
a 
RING. 
It has been 
proven 
by Hilbert 
and Weierstrafi 
that 
all generalizations 
of the field concept 
to triplets 
of 
elements 
are equivalent 
to the field 
of COMPLEX 
NUM- 
BERS.

Theorem 
A theorem 
due to Conway 
et al. (1997) 
which 
states 
that, 
if a POSITIVE 
definite 
QUADRATIC 
FORM 
with 
in- 
tegral 
matrix 
entries 
represents 
all natural 
numbers 
up 
to 15, then 
it represents 
all natural 
numbers. 
This 
the- 
orem 
contains 
LAGRANGE’S 
FOUR-SQUARE THEOREM, 
since every number 
up to 15 is the sum of at most 
four 
SQUARES.

Figurate 
Number 
P@@@ 
A number 
which 
can be represented 
by a regular 
geo- 
metrical 
arrangement 
of equally 
spaced 
points. 
If the 
arrangement 
forms 
a REGULAR POLYGON, the number 
is called 
a POLYGONAL NUMBER. The 
polygonal 
num- 
bers illustrated 
above are called 
triangular, 
square, 
pen- 
tagonal, 
and hexagon 
numbers, 
respectively. 
Figurate

can also form 
other 
shapes 
such as centered

Informally, 
a filter 
is a function 
or procedure 
which 
re- 
moves 
unwanted 
parts 
of a signal. 
The 
concept 
of fil- 
tering 
and 
filter 
functions 
is particularly 
useful 
in en- 
gineering. 
One 
particularly 
elegant 
method 
of filtering 
FOURIER TRANSFORMS a signal 
into 
frequency 
space, 
performs 
the filtering 
operation 
there, 
then 
transforms 
back into 
the original 
space (Press 
et al. 1992).

Finite 
A SET which 
contains 
a NONNEGATIVE integral 
number 
of elements 
is said to be finite. 
A SET which 
is not finite 
is said to be INFINITE. 
A finite 
or COUNTABLY INFI- 
NITE SET is said to be COUNTABLE. While 
the meaning 
of the term 
“finite” 
is fairly 
clear in common 
usage, pre- 
cise definitions 
of FINITE and INFINITE 
are needed 
in 
technical 
mathematics 
and especially 
in SET THEORY.

Finite 
Difference 
The finite 
difference 
is the discrete 
analog 
of the DERIV- 
ATIVE. The finite 
FORWARD DIFFERENCE of a function 
fp is defined 
as 
Af, 
= fp+1 
- fm 
(1) 
and the finite 
BACKWARD DIFFERENCE as 
Of, 
= fp - fp-1. 
(2) 
If the values are tabulated 
at spacings 
h, then the nota- 
tion 
fp = f (xo + ph) 
I= f (2) 
(3) 
is used. 
The 
/Ah FORWARD DIFFERENCE 
would 
then 
be written 
as akfp, 
and similarly, 
the kth BACKWARD 
DIFFERENCE as Vkfp. 
However, 
when 
fp is viewed 
as a discretiaation 
of the 
continuous 
function 
f(z), 
then 
the 
finite 
difference 
is 
sometimes 
written 
Af (x) = f (x + ;) - f (x - 
$) = 2$(x) 
* f(X), 
(4) 
where * denotes 
CONVOLUTION and II(x) 
is the odd IM- 
PULSE PAIR. 
The finite 
difference 
operator 
can therefore 
be written 
A = 2IIK 
(5) 
An nth POWER has a constant 
nth finite 
difference. 
For 
example, 
take n = 3 and make 
a DIFFERENCE TABLE, 
(6) 
The 
A3 column 
is the constant 
6. 
Finite 
difference 
formulas 
can be very useful 
for extrap- 
olating 
a finite 
amount 
of data 
in an attempt 
to find the 
general 
term. 
Specifically, 
if a function 
f(n) 
is known 
at 
only 
a few discrete 
values 
n = 0, 1, 2, . l . and it is de- 
sired to determine 
the analytical 
form of f, the following 
procedure 
can be used if f is assumed 
to be a POLYNOM- 
IAL function. 
Denote 
the nth 
value 
in the SEQUENCE 
of 
interest 
by a,. 
Then 
define 
b, as the FORWARD 
DIF- 
FERENCE 
A, 
= u,+~ 
-a,, 
cn as the second 
FORWARD

A2 =b

a table 
as follows 
a0 = f (0) 
al e f(1) 
a2 = f(2) 
l - 
ap= 
f(p) 
b() E a1 - a0 
bl = u2 - a1 
. . .

= ap - up-1

NEWTON’S

FORMULA. 
To see a particular 
example, 
consider 
a SEQUENCE with 
first few values 
of 1, 19, 143, 
607, 1789, 4211, 
and 8539.

Reading 
off the first 
number 
in each row gives a0 = 1, 
b. = 18, co = 106, do = 234, 
eo = 144. 
Plugging 
these 
in gives the equation 
f(n) 
= 1 + 18n + 53n(n

- l)(n 
- 2) 
+6n(n

- 2)(n

(10) 
which simplifies 
to f( n 
= 6n4+3n3+2n2+7n+1, 
and 
) 
indeed 
fits the original 
data 
exactly!

Finite 
Field 
A finite 
field 
is a FIELD with 
a finite 
ORDER (number 
of elements), 
also called 
a GALOIS FIELD. The 
order 
of 
a finite 
field 
is always 
a PRIME or a POWER of a PRIME 
(Birkhoff 
and Mac Lane 1965). 
For each PRIME POWER, 
there 
exists 
exactly 
one 
(up 
to an ISOMORPHISM) fi- 
nite 
field 
GF(p”), 
often 
written 
as II$ 
in current 
us- 
age* 
WP) 
is called 
the PRIME FIELD of order 
p, and 
is the FIELD of RESIDUE CLASSES modulo 
p, where the 
p elements 
are denoted 
0, I, . + l , p - 1. a = b in GF(p) 
means 
the same 
as a z b (mod 
p). 
Note, 
however, 
that 
2 x 2 E 0 (mod 
4) in the RING of residues 
modulo 
4, 
so 2 has no reciprocal, 
and the RING 
of residues 
mod- 
ulo 4 is distinct 
from 
the finite 
field 
with four elements. 
Finite 
fields 
are therefore 
denoted 
GF(p”), 
instead 
of 
GF(pl 
.g 9 pn) for clarity. 
The finite 
field GF(2) 
consists 
of elements 
0 and 1 which 
satisfy 
the followi “tg; addition 
and multiplications 
tables. 
If a subset 
S of the elements 
of a finite 
field 
F satisfies 
the above AXIOMS with 
the same operators 
of F, then S 

Finite Field 
Finite 
Group 
639 
is 
in 
called 
a S UBFIELD. 
Finite 
fields 
are used extensively 
the study 
of ERROR-CORRECTING 
CODES. 
When 
n > 1, GF(p”) 
can be represented 
as the 
FIELD 
of EQUIVALENCE 
CLASSES 
of POLYNOMIALS 
whose Co- 
EFFICIENTS 
belong 
to (SF(p). 
Any IRREDUCIBLE 
POLY- 
NOMIAL 
of degree 
n yields 
the same FIELD 
up to an ISO- 
MORPHISM. 
For example, 
for GF(23), 
the modulus 
can 
be taken 
as s3+z2+1 
= 0, x3+x+1, 
or any other 
IRRE- 
DUCIBLE 
POLYNOMIAL 
of degree 
3. Using 
the modulus 
x3 + II: + 1, the elements 
of GF(23)-written 
0, x0, x1, 
. * . -can 
be represented 
as POLYNOMIALS 
with 
degree 
less than 
3. For instance, 
lc3E--II:-ls+1 
x4 E x(x3) 
E x(x 
+ 1) E x2 + x 
X 5 E x(x” 
+ 2) E x3 + x2 E x2 - x - 1 z x2 + x + 1 
x6 E x(x” 
+ x + 1) = x3 + x2 + x = x2 - 
1 E x2 + 1 
x7 E x(x2 
+ 1) s x3 + x = -1 
= 1 E x0. 
Now consider 
the following 
table 
which contains 
several 
different 
representations 
of the elements 
of a finite 
field. 
The 
columns 
are the power, 
polynomial 
representation, 
triples 
of polynomial 
representation 
COEFFICIENTS 
(the 
vector 
representation), 
and the binary 
INTEGER 
corre- 
sponding 
to the vector 
representation 
(the regular 
rep- 
resentation).

The set of POLYNOMIALS 
in the second column 
is closed 
under 
ADDITION 
and MULTIPLICATION 
modulo 
x3 +x + 
1, and these 
operations 
on the set satisfy 
the AXIOMS 
of finite 
field. 
This 
particular 
finite 
field 
is said to be 
an extension 
field of degree 3 of GF(2), 
written 
GF(Z3), 
and the field GF(2) 
is called 
the base field of GF( 2”>. If 
an IRREDUCIBLE 
POLYNOMIAL 
generates 
all elements 
in 
this way, it is called 
a PRIMITIVE 
IRREDUCIBLE 
POLY- 
NOMIAL. 
For any PRIME 
or PRIME 
POWER 
q and any 
POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
n, there 
exists 
a PRIMITIVE 
IRRE- 
DUCIBLE 
POLYNOMIAL 
of degree n over GF(q). 
For any element 
c of GF(q), 
cq = c, and for any NON- 
ZERO element 
d of GF(q), 
dqB1 = 1. There 
is a small- 
est POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
72 satisfying 
the 
sum 
condition 
n 
n 1 = 
0 in GF(q), 
which 
is called 
the characteristic 
of the finite 
field 
GF(q). 
The 
characteristic 
is a PRIME 
NUMBER 
for every finite 
field, 
and it is true 
that 
over a finite 
field 
with 
characteristic

A GROUP 
of finite 
ORDER. 
Examples 
of finite 
groups 
are 
the MODULO 
MULTIPLICATION 
GROUPS 
and the POINT

The 
CLASSIFICATION 
THEOREM 
of finite 
SIM- 
PLE GROUPS 
states that 
the finite 
SIMPLE 
GROUPS 
can 
be classified 
completely 
into 
one of five types. 
There 
is no known 
FORMULA 
to give the number 
of pos- 
sible 
finite 
groups 
as a function 
of the 
ORDER 
h. It is 
possible, 
however, 
to determine 
the number 
of ABELIAN 
GROUPS 
using 
the KRONECKER 
DECOMPOSITION 
THE- 
OREM, 
and 
there 
is at least 
one ABELIAN 
GROUP 
for 
every finite 
order h. 
The following 
table 
gives the numbers 
and names 
of the 
first few groups 
of ORDER 
h. In the table, 
NNA 
denotes 
the number 
of non-Abelian 
groups, 
NA denotes 
the num- 
ber of ABELIAN

and IV the total 
number 
of

Miller

gave the number 
of groups 
for orders 
l- 
100, including 
an erroneous

Senior

Lunn

1935) 
subse- 
quently 
completed 
the list 
up to 215, but 
omitted 
128 
and 192. 
The 
number 
of groups 
of ORDER 
64 was cor- 
rected 
in Hall 
and 
Senior 
(1964). 
James 
et al. (1990) 
found 
2328 groups 
in 115 ISOCLINISM 
families 
of OR- 
DER 128, correcting 
previous 
work, 
and O’Brien 
(1991) 
found 
the number 
of groups 
of ORDER 
256. The number 
of groups 
is known 
for orders 
up to 1000, with 
the pos- 
sible exception 
of 512 and 768. Besche 
and Eick 
(1998) 
have determined 
the number 
of finite 
groups 
of orders 
less than 
1000 which 
are not 
powers 
of 2 or 3. These 
numbers 
appear 
in the 
Magma@ 
database. 
The 
num- 
bers of nonisomorphic 
finite 
groups 
IV of each ORDER 
h 
for the first few hundred 
orders are given in the following 
table 
(Sloane’s 
AOOOOOl-the 
very first sequence). 
The number 
of ABELIAN 
GROUPS 
of ORDER 
h is denoted 
NA 
(Sloane’s 
A000688). 
The 
smallest 
order 
for which 
there 
exist 
n = 1, 2, . . . nonisomorphic 
groups 
are 1, 4, 
75, 28, 8, 42, . . . (Sloane’s 
A046057). 
The incrementally 
largest 
number 
of nonisomorphic

To find 
the irreducible 
representation, 
note 
that 
there 
are three 
CONJUGACY 
CLASSES. 
Rule 
5 requires 
that 
there 
be three 
irreducible 
representations 
satisfying 
By rule 6, we can let the first representation 
have all Is.

To find representation 
orthogonal 
to the totally 
symmet- 
ric representation, 
we must 
have three 
+l 
and three 
-1 
CHARACTERS. 
We can also add the constraint 
that 
the 
components 
of the 
IDENTITY 
ELEMENT 
1 be positive. 
The 
three 
CONJWGACY 
CLASSES 
have 
1, 2, and 
3 ele- 
ments. 
Since we need a total 
of three 
+ls 
and we have 
required 
that 
a +l 
occur 
for the CONJUGACY 
CLASS of 
ORDER 
1, the remaining 
+ls 
must 
be used for the el- 
ements 
of the CONJUGACY 
CLASS of ORDER 
2, i.e., 
A 
and B. 
B 
Using 
the rule 
1, we see that 
l2 + l2 + ~~~(1) 
= 6, 
(16) 
so the final 
representation 
for 1 has CHARACTER 
2. Or- 
thogonality 
with 
the 
first 
two representations 
(rule 
3) 
then 
yields 
the following 
constraints: 
Solving 
these 
simultaneous 
equations 
by adding 
and 
subtracting 
(18) from 
(17), we obtain 
~2 = -1, 
;)c3 = 0. 
The full 
CHARACTER 
TABLE 
is then 
5 
Since 
there 
are only 
three 
CONJUGACY 
CLASSES, 
this 
table 
is conventionally 
written 
simply 
as 
yy 
Writing 
the irreducible 
representations 
in matrix 
form 
then 
yields

@ 22 
One of the two groups 
of ORDER 
4. The 
name 
of this 
group 
derives 
from 
the fact that 
it is a DIRECT 
PROD- 
UCT of two 22 SUBGROUPS. 
Like 
the group 
24, 22 @ 22 
is an ABELIAN 
GROUP. 
Unlike 
24, 
however, 
it is not 
CYCLIC. 
In 
addition 
to satisfying 
Ai 
= 
1 for each 
element 
Ai, 
it also satisfies 
Ai 
= 
1, where 
1 is the 
IDENTITY 
ELEMENT. 
Examples 
of the 
22 @ 22 group 
include 
the VIERGRUPPE, 
POINT

and the 
MODULO

In 
order 
to find 
the 
irreducible 
representations, 
note 
that 
the 
traces 
are given 
by x(1) 
= 
3,x(&) 
= 
-1, 
and x(eJ 
= x(d) 
= 1. Therefore, 
there 
are at least 
three 
distinct 
CONJUGACY 
CLASSES. 
However, 
we see 
from 
the MULTIPLICATION 
TABLE 
that 
there 
are actu- 
ally four CONJUGACY 
CLASSES, 
so group 
rule 5 requires 
that 
there 
must 
be four irreducible 
representations. 
By 
rule 
1, we are looking 
for POSITWE 
INTEGERS 
which 
satisfy 
112 
+ 
1z2 
+ 
E32 
+ 
142 
= 4. 
The only 
combination 
which 
will work is 
(16) 
h 
= 
22 
= 
23 
= 
24 = 1, 
(17) 
so there 
are four one-dimensional 
representations. 
Rule 
2 requires 
that 
the sum of the squares 
equal 
the ORDER 
h = 
4, so each 
1-D representation 
must 
have 
CHAR- 
ACTER 
S. 
Rule 
6 requires 
that 
a totally 
symmetric 
representation 
always 
exists, 
so we are free to start 
off 
with 
the first representation 
having 
all 1s. We then 
use 
orthogonality 
(rule 
3) to build 
up the other 
representa- 
tions. 
The

Exact 
Test 
A STATISTICAL 
TEST used to determine 
if there are non- 
random 
associations 
between 
two CATEGORICAL 
VARI- 
ABLES. 
Let 
there 
exist 
two such variables 
X 
and 
Y, 
with 
m and n observed 
states, 
respectively. 
Now form 
an n x m MATRIX 
in which the entries 
aij represent 
the 
number 
of observations 
in which 
EL: = i and y = j. 
Cal- 
culate 
the row and column 
sums Ri and Cj, respectively, 
and the total 
sum 
N=xRi=)jCj 
i 
j 
(which 
is a HYPERGEUMETRIC 
DISTRIBUTION). 
Now 
find all possible 
MATRICES 
of NONNEGATIVE 
INTEGERS 
consistent 
with 
the row and 
column 
sums 
Ri 
and 
Cj . 
For each one, calculate 
the 
associated 
P-VALUE 
using 
(0) (where 
the sum 
of these 
probabilities 
must 
be 1). 
Then 
the P-VALUE 
of the test is given 
by the sum of all 
P-VALUES 
which 
are < Pcrit. 
- 
The test is most 
commonly 
applied 
to a 2 x 2 MATRICES, 
and is computationally 
unwieldy 
for large 
m or n. 
As an example 
application 
of the test, let X be a journal, 
say either 
Mathematics 
Magazine 
or Science, 
and let Y 
be the number 
of articles 
on the topics 
of mathematics 
and biology 
appearing 
in a given 
issue of one of these 
journals. 
If Mathematics 
Magazine 
has five articles 
on 
math 
and one on biology, 
and Science 
has none on math 
and four on biology, 
then 
the relevant

When 
referring 
to a planar 
object, 
“fixed” 
means 
that 
the object 
is regarded 
as fixed 
in the plane 
so that 
it 
may not be picked 
up and flipped. 
As a result, 
MIRROR 
IMAGES are not necessarily 
equivalent 
for fixed objects.

If a variable 
is slightly 
displaced 
from 
a FIXED POINT, it 
may 
(1) move 
back 
to the fixed point 
(“asymptotically 
stable” 
or “superstable”), 
(2) move 
away ( “unstable”), 
or (3) move 
in a neighborhood 
of the fixed 
point 
but 
not approach 
it (“stable” 
but 
not 
“asymptotically 
sta- 
ble”). 
Fixed 
points 
are also called 
CRITICAL 
POINTS 
or EQUILIBRIUM POINTS. If a variable 
starts 
at a point 
that 
is not a CRITICAL POINT, it cannot 
reach a critical 
point 
in a finite 
amount 
of time. 
Also, a trajectory 
pass- 
ing through 
at least 
one point 
that 
is not 
a CRITICAL 
POINT cannot 
cross itself 
unless 
it is a CLOSED CURVE, 
in which 
case it corresponds 
to a periodic 
solution. 
A fixed point 
can be classified 
into 
one of several 
classes 
using LINEAR STABILITY analysis 
and the resulting 
STA- 
BILITY MATRIX.

a Tri-

The 
RIGIDITY 
THEOREM 
states 
that 
if the 
faces of a 
cwZtez POLYHEDRON 
are made 
of metal 
plates 
and the 
EDGES are replaced 
by hinges, 
the POLYHEDRON 
would 
be RIGID. 
The 
theorem 
was stated 
by Cauchy 
(1813), 
although 
a mistake 
in this 
paper 
went 
unnoticed 
for 
more 
than 
50 years. 
Concave 
polyhedra 
need not 
be 
RIGID, 
and such nonrigid 
polyhedra 
are called 
flexible 
polyhedra. 
Connelly 
(1978) 
found 
the first example 
of a 
reflexible 
polyhedron, 
consisting 
of 18 triangular 
faces. 
A flexible 
polyhedron 
with 
only 
14 triangular 
faces and 
9 vertices 
(shown 
above), 
believed 
to be the 
simplest 
possible 
composed 
of only 
triangles, 
was subsequently 
found 
by Steffen 
(Mackenzie 
1998). 
There 
also exists 
a six-vertex 
eight-face 
flexible 
polyhedron 
(Wunderlich 
and Schwabe 
1986, Cromwell 
1997). 
Connelly 
ef al. (1997) 
p roved that 
a flexible 
polyhedron 
must 
keep its VOLUME 
constant

1998).

the dashed 
curve in the above 
plot, 
and &o 
called 
the 
GREATESTINTEGERFUNCTION. 
In manycomputerlan- 
guages, 
the floor 
function 
is called 
the INTEGER PART 
function 
and 
is denoted 
int 
(x) . The 
name 
and sym- 
bol for the floor 
function 
were coined 
by K. E. Iverson 
(Graham 
et al. 1990). 
Unfortunately, 
in many 
older 
and current 
works 
(e.g., 
Shanks 
1993, 
Ribenboim 
1996), 
the symbol 
[x] is used 
instead 
of lx]. 
Because 
of the elegant 
symmetry 
of the 
floor function 
and CEILING FUNCTION symbols 
[xJ and 
[xl, 
and because 
[x] is such a useful symbol 
when inter- 
preted 
as an IVERSON BRACKET, the use of [x] to denote 
the Aoor function 
should 
be deprecated. 
In this 
work, 
the symbol 
[x] is used to denote 
the nearest 
integer 
NINT 
function 
since it naturally 
falls between 
the [zj 
and [xl

Fold 
Catastrophe 
A CATASTROPHE which 
can occur for one control

axis. 
Folding 
The points 
accessible 
from 
c by a single 
fold which leaves 
w,..., 
a72 fixed are exactly 
those points 
interior 
to or on 
the boundary 
of the intersection

at ai, for i = 1, . l 
l , n. Given 
any three 
points 
in the plane 
a, b, and c, there is an EQUILATERAL 
TRIANGLE 
with VERTICES x, y, and z for which a, b, and 
c are the images 
of x, y, and x under 
a single fold. 
Given 
any four points 
in the plane 
a, b, c, and d, there 
is some 
SQUARE 
with 
VERTICES 
x, y, Z, and w for which 
a, b, c, 
and d are the images 
of x, y, z, and w under 
a sequence 
of at most 
three 
folds. 
Also, 
any four collinear 
points 
are the images 
of the VERTICES of a suitable 
SQUARE 
under 
at most 
two folds. 
Every 
five (six) points 
are the 
images 
of the VERTICES of suitable 
regular 
PENTAGON 
(HEXAGON) under 
at most 
five (six) 
folds. 
The 
least 
number 
of folds 
required 
for n > 4 is not known, 
but 
some bounds 
are. In particular, 
every 
set of n points

Ford 
Circle 
Pick 
any two INTEGERS h and 
k, then 
the 
CIRCLE 
of 
RADIUS 
1/(21c2) 
centered 
at (h/k, 
1/(2K2)) 
is known 
as 
a Ford circle. 
No matter 
what and how many 
hs and ks 
are picked, 
none of the Ford circles intersect 
(and all are 
tangent 
to the X-AXIS). 
This 
can be seen by examining 
the squared 
distance 
between 
the centers 
of the circles 
with 
(h,k) 
and (h’, k’), 
(1) 
Let s be the sum of the radii 
1 
1 
s = 
Tl 
+ 
r2 
= 
g3-p 
(2) 
then 
d2 - s2 = (h’k 
- hkt)2 
- 1 
k2 kt2 
. 
(3) 
But 
(h’k 
- kth)2 
> 
1, so d2 - s2 > 
0 and 
the 
dis- 
- 
- 
tance 
between 
circle 
centers 
is > the sum 
of the 
CIR- 
- 
CLE RADII, with 
equality 
(and 
therefore 
tangency)

Four-Color 
Theorem 
The four-color 
theorem 
states that 
any map 
in a PLANE 
can be colored 
using 
four-colors 
in such a way that 
re- 
gions 
sharing 
a common 
boundary 
(other 
than 
a sin- 
gle point) 
do not 
share 
the 
same 
color. 
This 
prob- 
lem is sometimes 
also called 
GUTHRIE'S PROBLEM after 
F. Guthrie, 
who first 
conjectured 
the theorem 
in 1853. 
The CONJECTURE was then 
communicated 
to de Mor- 
gan and thence 
into 
the 
general 
community. 
In 1878, 
Cayley 
wrote the first paper 
on the conjecture. 
Fallacious 
proofs 
were given 
independently 
by Kempe 
(1879) 
and Tait 
(1880). 
Kempe’s 
proof was accepted 
for 
a decade 
until 
Heawood 
showed 
an error 
using 
a map 
with 
18 faces (although 
a map 
with 
nine 
faces suffices 
to show the fallacy). 
The HEAWOOD CONJECTURE~~~- 
vided 
a very general 
result 
for map 
coloring, 
showing 
that 
in a GENUS 0 SPACE (i.e., 
either 
the SPHERE or 
PLANE), six colors 
suffice. 
This 
number 
can easily 
be 
reduced 
to five, but 
reducing 
the number 
of colors 
all 
the way to four proved 
very difficult. 
Finally, 
Appel 
and Haken 
(1977) 
announced 
a computer- 
assisted 
proof 
that 
four colors 
were SUFFICIENT. How- 
ever, because 
part 
of the proof 
consisted 
of an exhaus- 
tive analysis 
of many 
discrete 
cases by a computer, 
some 
mathematicians 
do not 
accept 
it. 
However, 
no flaws 
have 
yet 
been 
found, 
so the 
proof 
appears 
valid. 
A 
potentially 
independent 
proof 
has recently 
been 
con- 
structed 
by N. Robertson, 
D. P. Sanders, 
P. D. Seymour, 
and R. Thomas.

Ti be walking 
along 
each road at a constant

Say that 
two travelers 
Ti and Tj 
have 
“met”

if Tr has met

Near

a “ringing”

occurs. 
For 
a function 
f(x) 
periodic 
on an interval 
[-L,

use a 
change 
of variables

If 
a function 
is EVEN 
so that 
f(x) 
= 
f (-x), 
then 
f(x) 
sin(nx) 
is ODD. 
(This 
follows 
since sin(nx) 
is ODD 
and an EVEN 
FUNCTION 
times 
an ODD 
FUNCTION 
is an 
ODD 
FUNCTION,) 
Therefore, 
6, 
= 0 for all n. 
Simi- 
larly, 
if a function 
is ODD 
so that 
f(x) 
= f(-x), 
then 
f(x) 
cos(nx) 
is ODD. 
(This 
follows since cos(nx) 
is EVEN 
and an EVEN 
FUNCTION 
times 
an ODD 
FUNCTION 
is an 
ODD 
FUNCTION.) 
Therefore, 
an = 0 for all n. 
Because 
the 
SINES 
and 
COSINES 
form 
a COMPLETE 
ORTHOGONAL 
BASIS, 
the 
SUPERPOSITION 
PRINCIPLE 
holds, 
and the Fourier 
series of a linear 
combination 
of 
two functions 
is the same 
as the linear 
combination 
of 
the 
corresponding 
two series. 
The 
COEFFICIENTS

Fourier 
series expansions 
for a few common 
functions 
are given in Beyer (1987, pp+ 411-412)

Transform 
Let f(x) 
be a positive 
definite, 
measurable 
function 
on 
the INTERVAL (-oo,oo). 
Then 
there 
exists a monotone 
increasing, 
real-valued 
bounded 
function 
a(t) 
such that 
f(x) = lo; eitx da(t) 
J-m 
for “ALMOST ALL"

If a(t) 
is nondecreasing 
and 
bounded 
and f(

d fi 
d 
x is 
e ne 
as above, 
then f(z) is called 
the Fourier-Stieltjes 
transform 
of a(t), 
and is both 
con- 
tinuous 
and positive

Some 
au- 
thors 
(especially 
physicists) 
prefer 
to write 
the 
trans- 
form 
in terms 
of angular 
frequency 
w G 27ru instead 
of 
the oscillation 
frequency 
V. However, 
this destroys 
the 
symmetry, 
resulting 
in the transform 
pair

In general, 
the Fourier

pair 
may 
be defined 
using 
two arbitrary

The Mathematic@ 
program 
(Wolfram 
Research, 
Cham- 
paign, 
IL) 
calls A the $FourierOverallConstant 
and B 
the $FourierFrequencyConstant, 
and defines 
A = B = 
1 by default. 
Morse 
and Feshbach 
(1953) 
use B = 1 and 
A = 
l/a. 
In this 
work, 
following 
Bracewell 
(1965, 
pp+ 6-7), 
A = 1 and B = -27r unless otherwise 
stated. 
Since any function

for f(x) 
discontinuous 
at x, 
provided 
that 
1. s_moo If(x)1

2. Any discontinuities 
are finite. 
3. The 
function 
has 
bounded 
variation. 
A 
SUFFI- 
CIENT 
weaker 
condition 
is fulfillment 
of the 
LIP- 
scm~z 
CONDITION. 
The smoother 
a function 
(i.e., 
the larger 
the number 
of 
continuous 
DERIVATIVES), 
the more compact 
its Fourier 
transform. 
The 
Fourier 
transform 
is linear, 
since if f(x) 
and g(x) 
have FOURIER 
TRANSFORMS 
F(k) 
and G(k), 
then

(12) 
Therefore, 
Fbf 
(x)+W)l 
= uF[f 
(x)]+bF[g(x)] 
= aF(k)+bG(k). 
(13) 
The 
Fourier 
transform 
is also symmetric 
since F(k) 
= 
F[f(x)] 
implies 
F(-k) 
= F[f(x)]. 
Let f *g denote 
the CONVOLUTION, 
then the transforms 
of convolutions 
of functions 
have particularly 
nice trans- 
forms, 
FEf * 91 = F[fF[91

relationship 
between

AUTOCORRELATION

the 
Fourier

known 
as the 
WIENER-

THEOREM. 
Let 
F[f(x)] 
= F(k), 
and F* 
denote 
the COMPLEX CONJUGATE ofF,thenthe 
FOUR- 
IER TRANSFORM of the ABSOLUTE SQUARE

The Fourier 
transform 
of a DERIVATIVE 
f’(x) 
of a func- 
tion 
f(x) 
is simply 
related 
to the transform 
of the func- 
tion 
f(x) 
itself.

(24) 
The 
first 
term 
consists 
of an oscillating 
function 
times 
f(x)* 
But 
if th e f unction 
is bounded 
so that 
lim 
f(x) 
= 0 
X-F&m 
(25) 
(as any physically 
significant 
signal 
must 
be), then 
the 
term 
vanishes, 
leaving 
F[f’(x)] 
= 2&k [m f (x)e-2=ikx 
dx = hikF[f 
(x)]a 
J--o0 
(26) 
This 
process 
can be iterated 
for the nth DERIVATIVE to 
yield 
F[f’“‘(x)] 
= (2rik)“F[f(x)] 
. 
(27) 
The 
important 
MODULATION 
THEOREM 
of Fourier 
transforms 
allows 
F[cos(Znkox) 
f (x)] to be expressed 
in 
terms 
of F[f(x)] 
= F(k) 
as follows, 
F[cos(Znkox)

(28) 
Since the 
DERIVATIVE 
of the 
FOURIER 
TRANSFORM 
is 
given 
by 
F’(k) 
= $F[ f (x)] = lrn 
(-Xx) 
f (x)e-2mikx

(29) 
it follows 
that

The VARIANCE of a FOURIER TRANSFORM is

(33) 
If f(x)

Any operation

Fractal 
An object 
or quantity 
which 
displays 
SELF-SIMILARITY, 
in a somewhat 
technical 
sense, on all scales. 
The object 
need not exhibit 
exactly 
the same structure 
at all scales, 
but 
the same 
“type” 
of structures 
must 
appear 
on all 
scales. 
A plot 
of the quantity 
on a log-log 
graph 
versus 
scale then 
gives a straight 
line, whose slope is said to be 
the FRACTAL DIMENSION. 
The 
prototypical 
example 
for a fractal 
is the length 
of a coastline 
measured 
with 
different 
length 
RULERS. The 
shorter 
the RULER, the 
longer 
the length 
measured, 
a PARADOX known 
as the 
COASTLINE PARADOX.

Fractal

The term 
“fractal 
dimension” 
is sometimes 
used to refer 
to what 
is more 
commonly 
called 
the 
CAPACITY 
DI- 
MENSION 
(which 
is, roughly 
speaking, 
the exponent 
D 
in the 
expression 
n(c) 
= CD, 
where 
n(c) 
is the min- 
imum 
number 
of OPEN 
SETS of diameter 
c needed 
to 
cover 
the 
set). 
However, 
it can more 
generally 
refer 
to any of the dimensions 
commonly 
used to character- 
ize fractals 
(e.g., 
CAPACITY 
DIMENSION, 
CORRELATION 
DIMENSION,INFORMATION

DI-

Given 
an INFINITIVE 
SEQUENCE {zn} 
with 
associated 
array 
a&j), 
then 
(2,) 
is said to be a fractal 
sequence 
1. 
If i + 1 =

then 
there 
exists 
m, < n such that 
2 = 
Gn,

for every j, there 
is exactly 
one k such 
that 
a&j) 
< a(h, k) < a(i,j 
+ 1). 
(As i and j range 
through 
N, 
the 
array 
A = a(Q), 
called 
the associative 
array 
of X, ranges 
through 
all of 
N.) 
An example 
of a fractal 
sequence 
is 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 
2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, . . . . 
If {zn} 
is a fractal 
sequence, 
then the associated 
array is 
an INTERSPERSION. If x is a fractal 
sequence, 
then 
the 
UPPER-TRIMMED 
SUBSEQUENCE is given 
by X(X) = 2, 
and 
the LOWER-TRIMMED 
SUBSEQUENCE V(x) 
is an- 
other 
fractal 
sequence. 
The 
SIGNATURE of an IRRA- 
TIONAL NUMBER is a fractal

Free 
When 
referring 
to a planar 
object, 
“free” 
means 
that 
the 
object 
is regarded 
as capable 
of being 
picked 
up out of 
the plane 
and flipped 
over. 
As a result, 
MIRROR 
IMAGES 
are equivalent 
for free objects. 
A free abstract 
mathematical 
object 
is generated 
by n 
elements 
in a “free manner,” 
i.e., such that 
the n ele- 
ments 
satisfy 
no nontrivial 
relations 
among 
themselves. 
To make 
this 
more 
formal, 
an algebraic 
GADGET X is 
freely 
generated 
by a SUBSET 
G if, for any 
function 
f : G + 
Y where 
Y is any other 
algebraic 
GADGET, 
there 
exists 
a unique 
HOMOMORPHISM (which 
has dif- 
ferent 
meanings 
depending 
on what 
kind 
of GADGETS 
you’re 
dealing 
with) 
g : X + 
Y such that 
g restricted 
to G is f. 
If the 
algebraic 
GADGETS 
are VECTOR 
SPACES, 
then 
G freely 
generates 
X IFF G is a BASIS for X. 
If the 
algebraic 
GADGETS 
are ABELIAN 
GROUPS, 
then G freely 
generates 
X IFF X is a DIRECT 
SUM of the INTEGERS, 
with 
G consisting 
of the standard 
BASIS. 
see UZSO FIXED, 
GADGET, 
MIRROR 
IMAGE, 
RANK 
Free 
Group 
The generators 
of a group 
G are defined 
to be the small- 
est subset of group 
elements 
such that 
all other 
elements 
of G can be obtained 
from 
them 
and their 
inverses. 
A 
GROUP is a free group 
if no relation 
exists 
between 
its 
generators 
(other 
than 
the relationship 
between 
an el- 
ement 
and 
its inverse 
required 
as one of the 
defining 
properties 
of a group). 
For example, 
the additive 
group 
of whole numbers 
is free with 
a single 
generator, 
1.

FREE SEMIGROUP 
Free 
Semigroup

product 
in which 
no PRODUCT 
can ever be expressed 
more simply 
in terms

ELEMENTS.

of a variable 
in a LOGIC FORMULA which 
is not inside 
the scope of a QUANTIFIER.

a pattern 
of leap years 
which 
repeats 
every 400 years. 
There 
are 4,800 months 
in 400 years, so the 13th of the month

in this 
interval. 
The

Fundamental 
Forms 
Fundamental 
Forms 
Fundamental 
Forms 
There 
are three 
types 
of so-called 
fundamental 
forms. 
The most important 
are the first 
and second 
(since the 
third 
can be expressed 
in terms 
of these). 
The 
fun- 
damental 
forms 
are extremely 
important 
and 
useful 
in 
determining 
the 
metric 
properties 
of a surface, 
such 
as LINE ELEMENT, AREA ELEMENT, NORMAL CURVA- 
TURE,GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE, and MEAN CURVATURE. 
Let A4 be a REGULAR SURFACE with 
vP, 
wP points 
on 
the TANGENT SPACE A& 
of M. 
Then 
the first 
funda- 
mental 
form 
is the INNER PRODUCT of tangent 
vectors, 
The 
coefficients 
are also denoted 
gUu = E, guv = F, 
and gvv = G. In CURVILINEAR COORDINATES (where 
F = 0), the quantities 
are called 
SCALE FACTORS. 
The 
second fundamental. 
form 
is given 
explicitly 
by 
edu’+Zf 
dudv+gdu’ 
(14) 
I(V*, 
Wp) 
= 
Vp 
. Wpm 
(1) 
For M 
E R3, the second 
fundamental 
form 
is the sym- 
metric 
bilinear 
form 
on the TANGENT SPACE M,, 
WV, t 
WP>

IWP, 
WP>

SbP) 
l S(WP)- 
(3) 
The 
first and second 
fundamental 
forms 
satisfy 
I(ax, 
+ bxv,axu 
+ bx,) 
= Ea2 + 2Fab + Gb2 
(4) 
II(ax, 
+ bx,, uxu + bx,) 
= a2 
+ 2 f ab + gb2, 
(5) 
and so their 
ratio 
is simply 
the NORMAL CURVATURE 
WP > 
K(Vp) = ~ I(% > 
(6) 
for any nonzeru 
TANGENT VECTOR. 
The 
third 
funda- 
mental 
form 
is given 
in terms 
of the 
first 
and 
second 
forms 
by 
III 
- 2HII

(7) 
where H is the MEA

The first fundamental 
form 
(or LINE ELEMENT) is given 
explicitly 
by the RIEMANNIAN METRIC 
ds2 = Edu2 
+2Fdudv+Gdv’. 
(8) 
It determines 
the ARC LENGTH of a curve on a surface. 
The 
coefficients 
are given 
by

Fundamental 
Group 
The 
fundamental 
group 
of a CONNECTED SET S is the 
QUOTIENT 
GROUP of the GROUP of all paths with initial 
and final points 
at a given point 
P and the SUBGROUP of 
all paths 
HOMOTOPIC 
to the degenerate 
path 
consisting 
of the point 
P. 
The 
fundamental 
group 
of the CIRCLE is the INFINITE 
CYCLIC GROUP. Two 
fundamental 
groups 
having 
dif- 
ferent 
points 
P 
are ISOMORPHIC. 
If the 
fundamental 
group 
consists 
only of the identity 
element, 
then the set 
S is simply 
connected.

System 
A set of ALGEBRAIC INVARIANTS for a QUANTIC such 
that 
any invariant 
of the QUANTIC is expressible 
as a 
POLYNOMIAL in members 
of the set. 
In 
1868, Gordan 
proved 
the existence 
of finite 
fundamental 
systems 
of al- 
gebraic 
invariants 
and covariants 
for any binary 
QUAN- 
TIC. In 1890, Hilbert 
(1890) 
proved 
the HILBE~~T 
BASIS

which 
is a finiteness 
theorem 
for the related 
concept 
of SYZYGIES.

Fundamental 
Theorem 
of Algebra 
Every 
POLYNOMIAL equation 
having 
COMPLEX COEF- 
FICIENTS 
and 
degree 
2 
1 has at least 
one 
COMPLEX 
ROOT. 
This 
theorem 
was first 
proven 
by Gauss. 
It is 
equivalent 
to the statement 
that 
a POLYNOMIAL 
P(z) 
of degree 
n has n values 
of x (some 
of them 
possi- 
bly 
degenerate) 
for which 
P(z) 
= 0. 
An example 
of 
a POLYNOMIAL with 
a single 
ROOT 
of multiplicity 
> 1 
is x2 - 22 + 1 = (z - l)(z 
- l), 
which 
has z = 1 as a 
Rook 
of multiplicity 
2.

Theorem 
The CIRCLES 
on the DIAGONALS 
ofa COMPLETE QUAD- 
RILATERAL as DIAMETERS are COAXAL. 
Furthermore, 
the ORTHOCENTERS 
of the four TRIANGLES 
of a COM- 
PLETE QUADRILATERAL 
are COLLINEAR on the RADI- 
CAL AXIS

COAXAL CIRCLES.

This 
is somewhat 
surprising 
because 
the total 
GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE is differential-geometric 
in character, 
but 
the EULER CHARACTERISTIC is topological 
in character 
and does not depend 
on differential 
geometry 
at all. 
So 
if you distort 
the surface 
and change 
the curvature 
at 
any location, 
regardless 
of how you do it, the same total 
curvature 
is maintained.

The

The

the Gauss-Bonnet 
theorem 
a simple 
consequence 
of the POINCARE-HOPF 
INDEX THEOREM, which 
is a 
nice way of looking 
at things 
if you’re 
a topologist, 
but 
not so nice for a differential 
geometer.

proof 
can

give a GAUSS'S THEOREMA EGREGIUM- 
inspired 
proof 
which 
is entirely 
intrinsic, 
without 
any 
reference 
to the ambient 
EUCLIDEAN SPACE. 
More specifically, 
if M is any 2-D RIEMANNIAN 
MANI- 
FOLD 
(like 
a surface in 3-space) 
and if T is an embedded 
triangle, 
then 
the Gauss-Bonnet 
formula 
states that 
the 
integral 
over the whole 
triangle 
of the GAUSSIAN CUR- 
VATURE with respect 
to AREA is given 
by 2n minus 
the 
sum of the JUMP ANGLES minus 
the integral 
of the GEO- 
DESIC CURVATURE over the whole of the boundary 
of the 
triangle 
(with

Gauss’s 
Class Number 
Conjecture 
In his monumental 
treatise 
Dis@itiones 
Arithmeticae, 
Gauss 
conjectured 
that 
the CLASS NUMBER h(4) 
of 
an IMAGINARY quadratic 
field 
with 
DI~CRIMINANT 
-d 
tends 
to infinity 
with 
d. 
A proof 
was finally 
given 
by 
Heilbronn 
(1934), 
and Siegel 
(1936) 
showed that 
for any 
E > 0, there 
exists a constant 
cE > 0 such that 
h(-d) > cEd1’2-e 
Gauss’s Class Number 
Problem 
as d + 
00. 
However, 
these 
results 
were not 
effective 
in actually 
determining 
the 
values 
for a given 
m of a 
complete 
list of fundamental 
discriminants 
-d 
such that 
h(-d) 
= m, a problem 
known 
as GAUSS'S CLASS NUM- 
BER PROBLEM. 
Goldfeld 
(1976) 
showed 
that 
if there 
exists 
a “Weil 
curve” 
whose associated 
DIRICHLET L-SERIES has a zero 
of at least third 
order 
at s = 1, then 
for any E > 0, there 
exists 
an effectively 
computable 
constant 
cE such that 
h(-d) 
> c,(lnd)‘-“. 
Gross and Zaiger 
(1983) 
showed that 
certain 
curves must 
satisfy 
the condition 
of Goldfeld, 
and 
Goldfeld’s 
proof 
was simplified 
by Oesterlh 
(1985).

Class Number 
Problem 
For a given 
m, determine 
a complete 
list of fundamen- 
tal DISCRIMINANTS 
-d 
such that 
the CLASS NUMBER 
is given by h( -d) 
= m. 
Heegner 
(1952) 
gave a solution 
for m 
= 1, but 
it was not completely 
accepted 
due to a 
number 
of apparent 
gaps. 
However, 
subsequent 
exam- 
ination 
of Heegner’s 
proof 
show it to be “essentially” 
correct 
(Conway 
and 
Guy 
1996). 
Conway 
and 
Guy 
(1996) 
therefore

the 
nine

THEOREM 

Gauss’s Theorema 
Egregium 
Gaussian Bivariate 
Distribution 
Gauss’s 
Theorema 
Egregium 
Gauss’s 
theorema 
egregium 
states 
that 
the 
GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE 
of a surface 
embedded 
in 
3-space 
may 
be 
understood 
intrinsically 
to 
that 
surface. 
“Resi- 
dents” 
of the surface 
may 
observe 
the 
GAUSSIAN 
CUR- 
VATURE 
of the surface 
without 
ever venturing 
into 
full 
&dimensional 
space; they 
can observe 
the curvature 
of 
the surface they 
live in without 
even knowing 
about 
the 
3-dimensional 
space in which 
they 
are embedded. 
In particular, 
GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE 
can be measured 
by checking 
how closely 
the 
ARC 
LENGTH 
of small 
RA- 
DIUS CIRCLES 
correspond 
to what they should 
be in Eu- 
CLIDEAN 
SPACE, 
2~ 
If the 
ARC 
LENGTH 
of CIRCLES 
tends 
to be smaller 
than 
what 
is expected 
in EUCLID- 
EAN SPACE, then the space is positively 
curved; 
if larger, 
negatively; 
if the same, 
0 GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE. 
Gauss 
(effectively) 
expressed 
the theorema 
egregium 
by 
saying 
that 
the 
GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE 
at a point 
is 
given 
by -R(w,w)v, 
w, 
where 
R is the 
RIEMANN 
TEN-

This

Gaussian 
distributions 
have many 
convenient 
properties, 
so random 
variates 
with 
unknown 
distributions 
are of- 
ten assumed 
to be Gaussian, 
especially 
in physics 
and 
astronomy. 
Although 
this 
can be a dangerous 
assump- 
tion, 
it is often a good approximation 
due to a surprising 
result 
known 
as the CENTRAL LIMIT 
THEOREM. 
This 
theorem 
proves that the MEAN 
of any set of variates 
with 
any distribution 
having 
a finite 
MEAN and VARIANCE 
tends 
to the Gaussian 
distribution. 
Many 
common 
at- 
tributes 
such as test scores, height, 
etc., follow 
roughly 
Gaussian 
distributions, 
with 
few members 
at the high 
and low ends and many 
in the middle. 
Making 
the transformation 
X-P 
ZE- 
u 
(4) 
so that 
dz = dz/a 
gives a variate 
with 
unit 
VARIANCE 
and 0 MEAN 
P(x)

(5) 
known 
as a standard 
NORMAL DISTRIBUTION. 
So de- 
fined, 
z is known 
as a Z-SCORE). 
The NORMAL DISTRIBUTION 
FUNCTION gives the prob- 
ability 
that 
a standard 
normal 
variate 
assumes 
a value 
in the interval 
[0, r], 
@( 1

Here, ERF is a function 
sometimes 
called 
the error func- 
tion. 
Neither 
a(z) 
nor ERF can be expressed 
in terms 
of 
finite 
additions, 
subtractions, 
multiplications,

in z/a 
with

a GAMMA DISTRIBUTION

and

Cramer 
showed 
in 1936 that 
if X and Y are INDEPEN- 
DENT variates 
and X + Y has a Gaussian 
distribution, 
then both 
X and Y must 
be Gaussian 
(CRAMER'S THE- 
OREM). 
The 
ratio 
X/Y 
of independent 
Gaussian-distributed 
variates 
with 
zero MEAN is distributed 
with 
a CAUCHY 
DISTRIBUTION. 
This 
can be seen as follows. 
Let X and 
Y both 
have MEAN 0 and standard 
deviations 
of ga: and 
Q, 
respectively, 
then 
the joint 
probability 
density 
func- 
tion

The

These

are equivalent 
since

example, 
2 = (1 + i)( 1 - i) is not a Gaussian 
prime.

Gaussian 
Integral 
The 
Gaussian 
integral, 
also 
called 
the 
PROBABILITY 
INTEGRAL, 
is the 
integral 
of the 
1-D 
Gaussian 
over 
(-oo,oo). 
It can be computed 
using 
the trick 
of com- 
bining 
two 1-D Gaussians 
- - dJW

e-(x2+~2) 
dy 
da: (1) 
-m -m 
and switching 
to POLAR COORDINATES, 
e -x2 dx = 
e -T2rdrd$ 
However, 
a simple 
proof 
can also be given 
which 
does 
not 
require 
transformation 
to 
POLAR 
COORDINATES 
(Nicholas

1950). 
The integral 
from

Geodesic 
Given 
two points 
on a surface, 
the geodesic 
is defined 
as the 
shortest 
path 
on the 
surface 
connecting 
them. 
Geodesics 
have many 
interesting 
properties. 
The 
NOR- 
MAL VECTOR 
to any point 
of a GEODESIC 
arc lies along 
the normal 
to a surface 
at that 
point 
(Weinstock 
1974, 
p. 65). 
Furthermore, 
no matter 
how 
badly 
a SPHERE 
is dis- 
torted, 
there 
exist 
an infinite 
number 
of closed 
geodes- 
ics on it. This 
general 
result, 
demonstrated 
in the early 
199Os, extended 
earlier 
work 
by Birkhoff, 
who proved 
in 1917 that 
there 
exists 
at least 
one closed 
geodesic 
on a distorted 
sphere, 
and Lyusternik 
and Schirelmann, 
who proved 
in 1923 that 
there 
exist at least three 
closed 
geodesics 
on such a sphere 
(Cipra 
1993)

A TRIANGULATION 
of a PLATONIC 
SOLID 
or 
other 
POLYHEDRON to produce 
a close 
approximation 
to a 
SPHERE. The 
nth 
order 
geodesation 
operation 
replaces 
each polygon 
of the polyhedron 
by the projection 
onto 
the CIRCUMSPHERE of the order 
n regular 
tessellation 
of that 
polygon. 
The 
above 
figure 
shows geodesations 
of orders 
1 to 3 (from 
top to bottom) 
of the TETRA- 
HEDRON, CUBE, OCTAHEDRON, DODECAHEDRON, and 
ICOSAHEDRON (from 
left to right). 
R. Buckminster 
Fuller 
designed 
the first 
geodesic 
dome 
(i.e., geodesation 
of a HEMISPHERE). Fuller’s 
dome 
was 
constructed 
from 
an ICOSAHEDRON by adding 
ISOSCE- 
LES TRIANGLES about 
each VERTEX and slightly 
reposi- 
tioning 
the VERTICES. In such domes, 
neither 
the VER- 
TICES nor the centers 
of faces necessarily 
lie at exactly 
the same distances 
from 
the center. 
However, 
these con- 
ditions 
are approximately 
satisfied. 
In the geodesic 
domes 
discussed 
by Kniffen 
(1994), 
the 
sum of VERTEX 
angles 
is chosen to be a constant. 
Given 
a PLATONIC 
SOLID, 
let 
e’ = 
2e/w be the 
number 
of 
EDGES 
meeting 
at a VERTEX 
and n be the number 
of 
EDGES 
of the constituent 
POLYGON. Call 
the angle 
of 
the old VERTEX point 
A and the angle 
of the new VER- 
TEX point 
F. Then 
A=B 
Ze’A = nF 
2A + F = 180”.

Geometric 
Construction 
In 
antiquity, 
geometric 
constructions 
of figures 
and 
lengths 
were restricted 
to use of only a STRAIGHTEDGE 
and COMPASS. Although 
the 
term 
"RULER" 
is some- 
times 
used instead 
of STRAIGHTEDGE," 
no markings 
which 
could 
be used 
to make 
measurements 
were al- 
lowed according 
to the Greek 
prescription. 
Furthermore, 
the "COMPASS" could 
not even be used to mark 
off dis- 
tances 
by setting 
it and then 
“walking” 
it along, 
so the 
COMPASS had to be considered 
to automatically 
collapse 
when not in the process 
of drawing 
a CIRCLE. 
Because 
of the 
prominent 
place 
Greek 
geometric 
con- 
structions 
held in Euclid’s 
EEements, 
these constructions 

730 
Geometric 
Construction 
are sometimes 
also known 
as EUCLIDEAN C~NSTRUC- 
TIONS. Such constructions 
lay at the heart 
of the GEo- 
METRIC PROBLEMS OF ANTIQUITY 
of CIRCLE SQUAR- 
ING, CUBE DUPLICATION, 
and TRISECTION of an AN- 
GLE. 
The 
Greeks 
were unable 
to solve these problems, 
but 
it was not 
until 
hundreds 
of years 
later 
that 
the 
problems 
were proved 
to be actually 
impossible 
under 
the limitations 
imposed. 
Simple 
algebraic 
operations 
such 
as a + b, a - b, TU 
(for r a RATIONAL NUMBER), a/b, 
ab, and 
fi 
can be 
performed 
using 
geometric 
constructions 
(Courant 
and 
Robbins 
1996). 
Other 
more 
complicated 
constructions, 
such as the solution 
of APOLLONIUS' 
PROBLEM 
and the 
construction 
of INVERSE POINTS can also accomplished. 
One of the simplest 
geometric 
constructions 
is the con- 
structionofa 
BISECTOR ofa LINE SEGMENT; illustrated 
above. 
Equilateral 
Triangle 
Square 
Pentagon 
17-gon 
The Greeks 
were very adept 
at constructing 
POLYGONS, 
but 
it took 
the genius 
of Gauss 
to mathematically 
de- 
termine 
which 
constructions 
were possible 
and 
which 
were not. 
As a result, 
Gauss 
determined 
that 
a se- 
ries of POLYGONS (the smallest 
of which 
has 17 sides; 
the 
HEPTADECAGON) 
had 
constructions 
unknown 
to 
the 
Greeks. 
Gauss 
showed 
that 
the 
CONSTRUCTIBLE 
POLYGONS 
(several 
of which 
are illustrated 
above) 
were 
closely 
related 
to numbers 
called 
the FERMAT 
PRIMES. 
Wernick 
(1982) 
gave a list 
of 139 sets of three 
located 
points 
from 
which 
a TRIANGLE 
was to be constructed. 
Of Wernick’s 
original 
list 
of 139 problems, 
20 had not 
yet been solved 
as of 1996 (Meyers 
1996). 
Geometric 
Construction 
It 
is possible 
to 
construct 
RATIONAL 
NUMBERS 
and 
EUCLIDEAN 
NUMBERS using 
a STRAIGHTEDGE 
and 
COMPASS construction. 
In 
general, 
the 
term 
for 
a 
number 
which 
can 
be constructed 
using 
a COMPASS 
and 
STRAIGHTEDGE 
is a CONSTRUCTIBLE 
NUMBER. 
Some 
IRRATIONAL 
NUMBERS, but 
no TRANSCENDEN- 
TAL NUMBERS, can be constructed. 
It turns 
out that 
all constructions 
possible 
with 
a COM- 
PASS and STRAIGHTEDGE canbe 
done witha 
COMPASS 
alone, 
as long 
as a line 
is considered 
constructed 
when 
its two endpoints 
are located. 
The 
reverse 
is also true, 
since Jacob 
Steiner 
showed 
that 
all constructions 
pos- 
sible 
with 
STRAIGHTEDGE and COMPASS can be done 
using 
only 
a straightedge, 
as long as a fixed CIRCLE and 
its 
center 
(or two intersecting 
CIRCLES without 
their 
centers, 
or three 
nonintersecting 
CIRCLES) have 
been 
drawn 
beforehand. 
Such 
a construction 
is known 
as a 
STEINER CONSTRUCTION. 
GEOMETROGRAPHY 
is a quantitative 
measure 
of the 
simplicity 
of a geometric 
construction. 
It reduces 
ge- 
ometric 
constructions 
to five types 
of operations, 
and 
seeks to reduce 
the 
total 
number 
of operations 
(called 
the 
LLS~~~~~~~~~'Y) needed 
to effect 
a geometric 
con- 
struction. 
Dixon 
(1991, 
pp. 
34-51) 
gives 
approximate 
construc- 
tions 
for some 
figures 
(the HEPTAGON and NONAGON) 
and 
lengths 
(PI) 
which 
cannot 
be 
rigorously 
con- 
structed.

Only 
in modern

2,000 years after they 
were formulated, 
were all three 
ancient 
problems 
proved

Geometry 
Geometry 
is the 
study 
of 
figures 
in 
a SPACE 
of a 
given 
number 
of dimensions 
and of a given 
type. 
The 
most 
common 
types of geometry 
are PLANE 
GEOMETRY 
(dealing 
with 
objects 
like the LINE, 
CIRCLE, 
TRIANGLE, 
and POLYGON), 
SOLID 
GEOMETRY 
(dealing 
with objects 
likethe 
LINE, 
SPHERE, 
and POLYHEDRON), 
and SPHER- 
ICAL GEOMETRY 
(dealing 
with 
objects 
like the SPHER- 
ICAL TRIANGLE 
and SPHERICAL 
POLYGON). 
Historically, 
the 
study 
of geometry 
proceeds 
from 
a 
small 
number 
of accepted 
truths 
(A XIOMS 
or POSTU- 
LATES), 
then 
builds 
up true 
statements 
using 
a system- 
atic 
and rigorous 
step-by-step 
PROOF. 
However, 
there 
is much 
more 
to geometry 
than 
this relatively 
dry text- 
book 
approach, 
as evidenced 
by some of the beautiful 
and unexpected 
results 
of PROJECTIVE 
GEOMETRY 
(not 
to mention 
Schubert’s 
powerful 
but 
questionable 
ENU- 
MERATIVE 
GEOMETRY). 
Formally, 
a geometry 
is defined 
as a complete 
locally 
homogeneous 
RIEMANNIAN 
METRIC. 
In @, the possible 
geometries 
are Euclidean 
planar, 
hyperbolic 
planar, 
and 
elliptic 
planar. 
In Iw”, the possible 
geometries 
include 
Euclidean, 
hyperbolic, 
and elliptic, 
but also include 
five 
other 
types.

If the sampling 
of an interferogram 
is modulated 
at a 
definite 
frequency 
instead 
of being 
uniformly 
sampled, 
spurious 
spectral 
features 
called 
“ghosts” 
are produced 
(Brault 
1985). 
P eriodic 
ruling 
or sampling 
errors 
intro- 
duce a modulation 
superposed 
on top 
of the expected 
fringe 
pattern 
due 
to uniform 
stage 
translation. 
Be- 
cause modulation 
is a multiplicative 
process, 
spurious 
features 
are generated 
in spectral 
space at the sum and 
difference 
of the true fringe 
and ghost 
fringe 
frequencies, 
thus throwing 
power out of its spectral 
band. 
Ghosts 
are copies 
of the actual 
spectrum, 
but 
appear 
at reduced 
strength. 
The 
above 
shows the power spec- 
trum 
for a pure 
sinusoidal 
signal 
sampled 
by translat- 
ing a Fourier 
transform 
spectrometer 
mirror 
at constant 
speed. 
The 
small 
blips 
on either 
side of the main 
peaks 
are ghosts. 
In order 
for a ghost 
to appear, 
the process 
producing 
it 
must 
exist 
for most 
of the interferogram. 
However, 
if 
the ruling 
errors 
are not truly 
sinusoidal 
but vary across 
the length 
of the screw, a longer 
travel 
path 
can reduce 
their 
effect.

Glissette 
The locus of a point 
P (or the envelope 
of a line) 
fixed in 
relation 
to a curve C which 
slides between 
fixed 
curves. 
For example, 
if C is a line 
segment 
and P a point 
on 
the line 
segment, 
then P describes 
an ELLIPSE when C 
slides so as to touch 
two ORTHOGONAL straight 
LINES. 
The 
glissette 
of the 
LINE 
SEGMENT C itself 
is, in this 
case, an ASTROID.

Glove 
Problem 
Let there 
be m doctors 
and 
n 5 m patients, 
and let all 
mn 
possible 
combinations 
of examinations 
of patients 
by doctors 
take place. 
Then 
what 
is the minimum 
num- 
ber of surgical 
gloves needed 
G(m, 
n) so that 
no dot tor 
must 
wear a glove 
contaminated 
by a patient 
and no 
patient 
is exposed 
to a glove 
worn 
by another 
doctor? 
In this problem, 
the gloves can be turned 
inside 
out and 
even placed 
on top of one another 
if necessary, 
but 
no 
“decontamination” 
of gloves 
is permitted. 
The 
optimal 
solution 
is 
2 
m-n=2 
9(m,n> 
= 
+(m+l) 
n=l,m=Zk+l 
[i(m) 
+ in] 
otherwise, 
where [zl is the CEILING FUNCTION (Vardi 
1991). 
The 
case m = n = 2 is straightforward 
since two gloves have 
a total 
of four surfaces, 
which 
is the number 
needed 
for 
mn = 4 examinations.

Theorem 
If T is a set of AXIOMS in a first-order

and a 
statement 
JI holds for any structure 
M satisfying 
T, then 
p can be formally

from

INCOMPLETENESS 
THEOREM 
GSdel’s 
Incompleteness 
Theorem 
Informally, 
Gijdel’s 
incompleteness 
theorem 
states 
that 
all consistent 
axiomatic 
formulations 
of NUMBER 
THE- 
ORY include 
undecidable 
propositions 
(Hofstadter 
1989). 
This 
is is sometimes 
called 
Gijdel’s 
first 
incompleteness 
theorem, 
and answers in the negative 
HILBERT’S 
PROB- 
LEM asking 
whether 
mathematics 
is “complete” 
(in the 
sense that 
every statement 
in the language 
of NUMBER 
THEORY 
can be either 
proved 
or disproved). 
Formally, 
Gijdel’s 
theorem 
states, 
“To every w-consistent 
recursive 
class K of FORMULAS, 
there 
correspond 
recursive 
class- 
signs T such that 
neither 
(U Gen 
r) nor Neg(v 
Gen r) 
belongs 
to Fig(h), 
where 
21 is the FREE 
VARIABLE 
of T” 
(Gijdel 
1931), 
A statement 
sometimes 
known 
as Gijdel’s 
second incom- 
pleteness 
theorem 
states 
that 
if NUMBER 
THEORY 
is 
consistent, 
then 
a proof 
of this 
fact does not exist 
us- 
ing the methods 
of first-order 
PREDICATE 
CALCULUS. 
Stated 
more 
colloquially, 
any formal 
system 
that 
is in- 
teresting 
enough 
to formulate 
its own consistency 
can 
prove 
its own consistency 
IFF it is inconsistent. 
Gerhard 
Gentzen 
showed that 
the consistency 
and com- 
pleteness 
of arithmetic 
can be proved 
if “transfinite” 
in- 
duction 
is used. 
However, 
this approach 
does not allow 
proof 
of the consistency 
of all mathematics.

Goldbach 
Conjecture 
Goldbach’s 
original 
conjecture, 
written 
in a 1742 letter 
to Euler, 
states 
that 
every 
INTEGER 
> 
5 is the 
SUM 
of three 
PRIMES. 
As re-expressed 
by Euler, 
an equiv- 
alent 
of this 
CONJECTURE 
(called 
the 
“strong” 
Gold- 
bath 
conjecture) 
asserts 
that 
all POSITIVE 
EVEN 
INTE- 
GERS 2 4 can be expressed 
as the SUM of two PRIMES. 
Schnirelmann 
(1931) 
proved 
that 
every 
EVEN 
number 
can be written 
as the 
sum 
of not 
more 
than 
300,000 
PRIMES 
(Dunham 
1990), 
which 
seems a rather 
far cry 
from 
a proof 
for four 
PRIMES! 
The 
strong 
Goldbach 
conjecture 
has been 
shown 
to be true 
up to 4 x 1011 
by Sinisalo 
(1993). 
Pogoraelski 
(1977) 
claimed 
to have 
proven 
the 
Goldbach 
conjecture, 
but 
his proof 
is not 
generally 
accepted 
(Shanks 
1993). 
The 
conjecture 
that 
all ODD 
numbers 
> 9 are the SUM 
of three 
ODD 
PRIMES 
is called 
the 
“weak” 
Goldbach 
conjecture. 
Vinogradov 
proved 
that 
all ODD 
INTEGERS 
starting 
at some 
sufficiently 
large 
value 
are the 
SUM 
of three 
PRIMES 
(Guy 
1994). 
The 
original 
“sufficiently 
large'1 
jv > 3315 = ee16*s73 was subsequently 
reduced 
to 
e 
p503 
biGhen 
and Wang 
(1989). 
Chen 
(1973, 
1978) 
also showed 
that 
all sufficiently 
large 
EVEN 
NUMBERS 
are the sum of a PRIME 
and the 
PRODUCT 
of at most 
two PRIMES 
(Guy 
1994, 
Courant 
and Robbins 
1996). 
It 
has been 
shown 
that 
if the weak 
Goldbach 
conjec- 
ture 
is false, 
then 
there 
are only 
a FINITE 
number 
of 
exceptions. 
Other 
variants 
of the Goldbach 
conjecture 
include 
the 
statements 
that 
every 
EVEN 
number 
2 6 is the 
SUM of 
two ODD 
PRIMES, 
and every 
INTEGER 
> 17 the sum of 
exactly 
three 
distinct 
PRIMES. 
Let R(n) 
be the number 
of representations 
of an EVEN 
INTEGER 
n as the sum of 
two PRIMES. 
Then 
the “extended” 
Goldbach 
conjecture 
states 
that 
where 
4(z) 
is the 
TOTIENT 
FUNCTION 
(Guy 
1994, 
p* 105). 
Vinogradov 
(1937ab, 
1954) 
proved 
that 
every 
suffi- 
ciently 
large 
ODD 
NUMBER 
is the sum of three 
PRIMES, 
and 
Estermann 
(1938) 
proves 
that 
almost 
all 
EVEN 
NUMBERS 
are the sums of two PRIMES.

Golomb 
Ruler 
A Golomb 
ruler 
is a set of NONNEGATIVE 
integers 
such 
that 
all pairwise 
POSITIVE 
differences 
are distinct. 
The 
optimum 
Golomb 
ruler 
with 
n 
marks 
is the 
Golomb 
ruler 
having 
the 
smallest 
possible 
maximum 
element 
(“length”). 
The 
set (0, 1, 3, 7) is an order 
four Golomb 
ruler 
since 
its differences 
are 
(1 = 
1 - 0, 2 = 
3 - 1, 
3 = 3-0, 
4 = 7-3, 
6 = 7-1, 
7 = 7-O), 
all ofwhich 
are 
distinct. 
However, 
the optimum 
4-mark 
Golomb 
ruler 
is 
(0, 1, 4, 6), which 
measures 
the distances 
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6) (and is therefore 
also a PERFECT 
RULER). 
The 
lengths 
of the optimal 
n-mark 
Golomb 
rulers 
for 
n = 2, 3, 4, . . . are 1, 3, 6, 11, 17, 25, 34, . . . (Sloane’s 
A003022, 
Vanderschel 
and Garry). 
The 
lengths 
of the 
optimal 
n-mark 
Golomb 
rulers 
are not known 
for n 2 20.

Goodstein 
Sequence 
Given 
a HEREDITARY 
REPRESENTATION 
of a number 
n in BASE, 
let B[b](n) 
be the NONNEGATIVE 
INTEGER 
which 
results 
if we syntactically 
replace 
each b by b + 1 
( i.e., 
B[b] 
is a base change 
operator 
that 
‘bumps 
the 
base’ from 
b up to b + 1). The HEREDITARY 
REPRESEN- 
TATION 
of 266 in base 2 is 
266 = Z8 + 23 + 2 
=2 zz2+l + 22+1 + 2, 
so bumping 
the base from 
2 to 3 yields 
B[2](266) 
= 333+1 + 33+1 + 3. 
Now repeatedly 
bump 
the base and subtract 
1, 
Go (266) = 266 = z2’+l + z2+l + 2 
&(266) 
= B[2](266) 
- 1 = 333+1 + 33+1 + 2 
C2(266) 
= B[3](G1) 
- 1 = 444” 
+ 44+1 + 1 
G3(266) 
= B[4](&) 
- 1 = 555+1 + 55+1 
G4(266) 
= B[5J(G3) 
- 1 = 6”‘+l 
+ 66+1 - 1 
=6 “+l 
+ 5 - 6” + 5 l 65 + . . . + 5

=7 77+1 + 5 - 77 + 5 l 75

l . . + 5 ’ 7 + 4,

Starting 
this procedure 
at an INTEGER 
n gives the 
Goodstein 
sequence 
{ Gk (n)}. 
Amazingly, 
despite 
the 
apparent 
rapid 
increase 
in the 
terms

Goodstein’s 
Theorem 
Gosper ‘s Algorithm 
749 
Goodstein’s 
Theorem 
For all n, there 
exists 
a k such that 
the 
kth 
term 
of 
the GOODSTEIN SEQUENCE C&(n)= 
0. In other 
Words, 
every GOODSTEIN 
SEQUENCE 
converges 
to 0. 
The 
secret underlying 
Goodstein’s 
theorem 
is that 
the 
HEREDITARY 
REPRESENTATION of n in base b mimics 
an ordinal 
notation 
for ordinals 
less than 
some number. 
For such ordinals, 
the base bumping 
operation 
leaves the 
ordinal 
fixed 
whereas 
the subtraction 
of one decreases 
the ordinal. 
But 
these 
ordinals 
are well-ordered, 
and 
this 
allows 
us to conclude 
that 
a Goodstein 
sequence 
eventually 
converges 
to zero.

An ALGORITHM 
for finding

The 
algorithm 
treats 
sums whose suc-

have 
ratios 
which 
are RATIONAL 
FUNC- 
TIONS. 
Not 
only 
does it decide 
conclusively

a hypergeometric 
sequence 
X~ such that

=

but 
actually

If not, 
it pro- 
duces

(Petkovgek1996): 
An 
outline 
of the 
algorithm 
follows 
1. For the ratio 
r(n) 
= t,+& 
which 
is a RATIONAL 
FUNCTION of n. 
2. Write 
a(n) c(n + 1) 
rb4 = Zl(n)C(7L)’ 
where a(n), 
b(n), 
and c(n) are polynomials 
satisfying 
GCD(a(n), 
b(n + h) = 1 
for all nonnegative 
integers 
h. 
3. Find 
a nonzero 
polynomial 
solution 
x(n) 
of 
a(n)x(n 
+ 1) - b(n - 1)x(n) 
= c(n), 
if one exists. 
4. Return 
b(n - l)x(n)/c(n)t, 
and stop. 
Petkovgek

the algorithm 
as “one of

Graceful 
Graph 
A LABELLED 
GRAPH 
which 
can be 
“gracefully 
num- 
bered” 
is called 
a gracefu1 
graph. 
Label 
the 
nodes 
with 
distinct 
NONNEGATIVE INTEGERS. Then 
label 
the 
EDGES with 
the absolute 
differences 
between 
node val- 
ues. 
If the 
EDGE 
numbers 
then 
run 
from 
1 to e, the 
graph 
is gracefully 
numbered. 
In order 
for a graph 
to 
be graceful, 
it must 
be without 
loops or multiple 
EDGES.

Thomsen

Golomb 
showed 
that 
the number 
of EDGES connecting 
the 
EVEN-numbered 
and 
ODD-numbered 
sets of nodes 
is l(e + q/q 
1 where e is the number 
of EDGES. In ad- 
dition, 
if the nodes 
of a graph 
are all of EVEN ORDER, 
then 
the graph 
is graceful 
only 
if [(e + 1)/2] 
is EVEN.

only 
ungraceful 
simple 
graphs 
with

Graph 
(Graph

A mathematical 
object 
composed 
of points 
known 
as 
VERTICES or NODES 
and lines connecting 
some (possibly 
empty) 
SUBSET of them, 
known 
as EDGES. 
The 
study 
of graphs 
is known 
as GRAPH 
THEORY. 
Graphs 
are 1-D 
COMPLEXES, 
and there 
are always 
an EVEN 
number 
of 
ODD 
NODES 
in a graph. 
The 
number 
of nonisomorphic 
graphs 
with 
w NODES 
is given 
by the P~LYA 
ENUMER- 
ATION 
THEOREM. 
The first few values 
for n = 1, 2, . . . , 
are 1, 2, 4, 12, 34, 156, 1044, . l . (Sloane’s 
A000088;

where 
the ji

For example, 
for p = 3, the three possible 
values of j are 
h = W,Q, 
since (l-3)

l 0) + (3 
l 0) = 3, 
giving 
hj, = 
3! 
(133!)(200!)(300!)

(4) 
j2 = (l,l, 
0), since (1 . 1) + (2 
l 1) + (3 
l 0) = 3, 
giving 
hj, 
=

(111’)(211’)(300!)

corresponds 
to a HAMILTONIAN

The

still, 
the binary

responding 
binary

at the right 
with 
the digit 
d, 
(the nth, 
or last, 
DIGIT). 
If the &-I 
is 1, replace 
d, by 1 - d,; otherwise, 
leave it unchanged. 
Then 
proceed 
to d,-1. 
Continue 
up to the first

is kept 
the same 
since do is assumed 
to be a 
0. The resulting

unchanged. 
Next 
compute 
n-2 
En-1 
E >Ig; 
(mod 
2), 
i=l 
and 
so on. 
The 
resulting 
number 
dl d2 9 9 0 dn-1 d, 
is 
the BINARY 
number 
corresponding 
to the initial 
binary 
reflected 
Gray 
code. 
The 
code is called 
reflected 
because 
it can be generated 
in the following 
manner. 
Take 
the Gray 
code 0, 1. Write 
it forwards, 
then backwards: 
0, 1, 1, 0. Then 
append 
OS 
to the first half and 1s to the second half: 
00, 01, 11, 10. 
Continuing, 
write 
00, 01, 11, 10, 10, 11, 01, 00 to obtain: 
000, 
001, 
011, 
010, 
110, 
111, 
101, 
100, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A014550). 
Each iteration 
therefore 
doubles 
the number 
of codes. 
The 
Gray codes corresponding 
to the first few 
nonnegative 
integers 
are given 
in the following 
table.

For the Earth,

Unfortunately, 
the FLATTENING

the Earth 
cannot 
be taken 
into 
account 
in this 
simple 
derivation, 
since the problem 
is considerable 
more

plicated 
for a SPHEROID

of which 
has a RADIUS

is a function

However, 
because 
this 
is a special 
case of Q = 0 with 
P

functions

the GEODESIC

This

also with 
the

a LATTICE of points

the NONZERO ai term 
with 
least 
i, set all aj = 0 for j < i, and build 
up the remaining 
terms 
from 
(4) 
for j =i- 
1, . . . . 1 until 
A = 0 or all possibilities 
have 
been exhausted. 
For example, 
MCNUGGET NUMBERS are numbers 
which 
are representable 
using 
only 
(al, a~, as) 
= 
(6,9,20). 
Taking 
n = 62 and 
applying 
the 
algorithm 
iteratively 
gives the sequence 
(0, 0, 3), (0, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2), (3, 0, 
2), (1, 4, l), 
at which 
point 
A = 0. 
62 is therefore 
a 
MCNUGGET NUMBER with 
62 = (10 6)+(49+(1-20). 
(5) 
If 
any INTEGER n can be represented 
with 
ci = 
0 or 
1 using 
a sequence 
(al, 
a~, . . . ), then 
this 
sequence 
is 
called 
a COMPLETE SEQUENCE. 
A greedy 
algorithm 
can also be used to break 
down arbi- 
trary 
fractions 
into UNIT FRACTIONS in a finite 
number 
of steps. 
For a FRACTION a/b, 
find the least INTEGER 
~1 such that 
l/xl 
5 a/b, 
i.e., 
Pl 
x1=-, a 
(6) 
where 
[xl is the CEILING FUNCTION. 
Then 
find 
the 
least INTEGER 22 such that 
1/x2 
< a/b - l/xl. 
Iterate 
- 
until 
there 
is no remainder. 
The ALGORITHM gives two 
or fewer terms 
for l/n 
and 2/n, 
three 
or fewer terms 
for 
3/n, 
and four or fewer for 4/n.

A group 
G 
is defined 
as a finite 
or infinite 
set of 
OPERANDS (called 
“elements”) 
A, L3, C, . . . that may be 
combined 
or “multiplied” 
via a BINARY OPERATOR to 
form 
well-defined 
products 
and which 
furthermore 
sat- 
isfy the following 
conditions: 
Closure: 
If A and B are two elements 
in G, then the 
product 
AB 
is also in G. 
Associativity: 
The 
defined 
multiplication 
is associa- 
tive, 
i.e., for all A, B, C E G, (AB)C 
= A(BC). 
Identity: 
There 
is an IDENTITY 
ELEMENT I (a.k.a. 
1, E, or e) such that 
IA 
= AI 
= A for every element 
A E G. 
Inverse: 
There 
must 
be an inverse 
or reciprocal 
of 
each element. 
Therefore, 
the 
set must 
contain 
an 
element 
13 = A-’ 
such that 
AA-l 
= A-lA 
= I for 
each element 
of G. 
A 
1s 
group 
is therefore 
a MONOID for 
invertible. 
A group 
must 
contain 
which 
every 
at leas t one 
element 
element. 
The 
study 
of groups 
is known 
as GROUP THEORY. If 
there are a finite 
number 
of elements, 
the group 
is called 
a FINITE GROUP and the number 
of elements 
is called 
the ORDER of the group. 
Since 
each element 
A, B, C, . . . , X, 
and Y is a mem- 
ber of the GROUP, GROUP property 
1 requires 
that 
the 
product 
DE 
ABC*.-XY 
(1) 
must 
also 
be 
a 
member. 
Now 
apply 
D 
to 
y-lx-1 
. . . ~-l~-l~-f 
? 
D(y-‘X-l 
. . . C-lB-lA-l) 
= (ABC*.

FORMATION which 
will

The 
IRREDUCIBLE 
REPRESENTATION has some remarkable 
properties. 
Let 
the ORDER of a GROUP be h, and the dimension 
of the 
ith representation 
(the order 
of each constituent 
matrix) 
be Zi (a POSITIVE INTEGER). 
Let 
any operation 
be de- 
noted 
R, and 
let the nzth row and nth 
column 
of the 
matrix 
corresponding 
to a matrix 
R in the 
ith 
IRRE- 
DUCIBLE REPRESENTATION be I?i( R),, 
. The 
following 
properties 
can be derived 
from 
the GROUP ORTHOGO- 
NALITY THEOREM,

be a POSITIVE INTEGER and

In a given 
representation, 
reducible 
or irreducible, 
the CHARACTERS of all MATRICES belonging 
to op- 
erations 
in the 
same 
class are identical 
(but 
differ 
from 
those in other 
representations) 
l 
The 
number 
of IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS of 
a GROUP is equal 
to the 
number 
of CONJUGACY 
CLASSES in the GROUP. This 
number 
is the dimen- 
sion of the r MATRIX (although 
some may have zero 
elements) 
.

Groupoid 
There 
are at least 
two definitions 
of “groupoid” 
cur- 
rently 
in use. 
The 
first 
type 
of groupoid 
is an algebraic 
structure 
on 
a SET with 
a BIN ARY OPERATOR. 
The 
only 
restriction 
on the operator 
is CLOSURE 
(i.e., 
applying 
the BINARY 
OPERATOR 
to two elements 
of a given 
set S returns 
a value 
which 
is itself 
a member 
of S). 
Associativity, 
commutativity, 
etc., 
are not 
required 
(Rosenfeld 
1968, 
pp. 88-103). 
A groupoid 
can be empty. 
The numbers 
of 
nonisomorphic 
groupoids 
of this type 
having 
n elements 
are 1, 1, 10, 3330, 
178981952, 
. l 
l 
(Sloane’s 
AOO1329), 
and the numbers 
of nonisomorphic 
and nonantiisimor- 
phic 
groupoids 
are 1, 7, 1734, 
89521056, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A001424). 
A n associative 
groupoid 
is called 
a SEMI- 
The 
second 
type 
of grou’poid 
is an algebraic 
structure 
first defined 
by Brandt 
(1926) 
and also known 
as a VIR- 
TUAL 
GROUP. 
A groupoid 
with 
base B is a set G with 
mappings 
a and p from 
G onto B and a partially 
defined 
binary 
operation 
(s, h) H 
gh, 
satisfying 
the following 
four conditions: 
1. gh is defined 
only 
when 
p(C) 
= 
a(h) 
for certain 
maps 
Q! and p from 
G onto 
Iw2 with 
ct : (x, y, y) ++ zc 
and P: 
(vY,Y) 
++ Y* 
2. ASSOCIATIVITY: 
If either 
(gh)Jc or g(U) 
is defined, 
then 
so is the other 
and (gh)k 
= g(M). 
3. For each g in G, there 
are left and right 
IDENTITY 
ELEMENTS 
A, and ps such that 
X,g = g = gps. 
4. Each g in G has an inverse 
9-l 
for which 
99-l 
= X, 
and gclg 
= ps 
(Weinstein 
1996). 
A groupoid 
is a small 
CATEGORY 
with 
every morphism 
invertible.

Grundy’s 
Game 
A special

played 
by the 
following 
rules. 
Given 
a heap of size n, two players 
alternately 
select 
a 
heap and divide 
it into two unequal 
heaps. 
A player 
loses 
when 
he cannot 
make 
a legal 
move 
because 
all heaps 
have size 1 or 2. Flammenkamp 
gives a table 
of the ex- 
tremal

A 2-D generalization 
of the HAAR

proposed 
by Dudeney 
(1907) 
and 
discussed 
in Gardner 
(1961, 
p. 34) and 
Stewart 
(1987,

can be hinged 
so that 
the three 
pieces collapse 
into either 
the TRIANGLE or the SQUARE.

Hadamard 
Matrix 
A class of SQUARE 
MATRIX 
invented 
by Sylvester 
(1867) 
underthenameof 
ANALLAGMATIC PAVEMENT. AHad- 
amard 
matrix 
is a SQUARE 
MATRIX containing 
only 
1s 
and 
-1s 
such that 
when 
any two columns 
or rows are 
placed 
side by side, HALF 
the adjacent 
cells are the same 
SIGN and half the other 
(excepting 
from the count 
an 1;- 
shaped 
“half-frame” 
bordering 
the matrix 
on two sides 
which is composed 
entirely 
of Is). 
When 
viewed as pave- 
ments, 
cells with 
1s are colored 
black 
and those with 
-1s 
are colored 
white. 
Therefore, 
the n x n Hadamard 
ma- 
trix H, must 
have n(n 
- 1)/2 
white 
squares 
(-1s) 
and 
n(n + 1)/2 
black 
squares 
(1s). 
This 
is equivalent 
to the definition 
H,HnT 
= nln, 
(1) 
where 
1, is the n x n IDENTITY 
MATRIX. 
A Hadamard 
matrix 
of order 
4n + 4 corresponds 
to a HADAMARD 
DESIGN (4n + 3, 2n + 1, n). 
PALEY'S THEOREM guarantees 
that 
there 
always 
exists 
a Hadamard 
matrix 
H, when 
n is divisible 
by 4 and of 
the form 
2”(q” 
+ l), where p is an ODD PRIME. In such 
cases, the MATRICES can be constructed 
using 
a PALEY 
CONSTRUCTION. 
The PALEY CLASS k is undefined

the following

(and 
verified 
up to n < 428) that H, exists for all n DIVISIBLE 
by 4 (van Lint 
and Wilson 
1993). 
However, 
the proof 
of this CONJECTURE remains 
an important 
problem 
in 
CODING THEORY. The number 
of Hadamard 
matrices 
of 
order 4n are 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 60,487, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
AOO7299).

then H,,

replacing 
aI1 1s in H, by H, and all

Note 
that 
in the above

if f”(x)

then 
NEWTON'S

is recovered. 
This 
form 
of 
Halley’s 
irrational 
formula 
has cubic 
convergence, 
and 
is usually 
found 
to be substantially 
more 
stable 
than 
NEWTON’S 
METHOD. 
However, 
it does run 
into 
diffi- 
culty 
when both 
f(x) 
and 
f’(x) 
or f’(x) 
and f”(x) 
are 
simultaneously 
near zero.

Happy 
Number 
Let 
the 
sum 
of the SQUARES of the 
DIGITS 
of a POS- 
ITIVE 
INTEGER 
SO be represented 
by sl. 
In a similar 
way, let the sum of the SQUARES 
of the DIGITS of ~1 be 
represented 
by ~2, and so on. 
If some 
si = 1 for i 2 1, 
then 
the original 
INTEGER SO is said to be happy. 
Once 
it is known 
whether 
a number 
is happy 
(or not), 
then any number 
in the sequence 
~1, ~2, ~3, . . . will also 
be happy 
(or not). 
A number 
which 
is not 
happy 
is 
called UNHAPPY. Unhappy 
numbers 
have EVENTUALLY 
PERIODIC sequences 
of si 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20, 
4, .*. 
which 
do not reach 
1. 
Any 
PERMUTATION 
of the 
DIGITS 
of an UNHAPPY 
or 
happy 
number 
must 
also be unhappy 
or happy. 
This 
follows 
from 
the fact that 
ADDITION 
is COMMUTATIVE. 
The first few happy 
numbers 
are 1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23,

Hardy-Littlewood 
Conjectures 
The 
first 
Hardy-Littlewood 
conjecture 
is called 
the 
k- 
TUPLE CONJECTURE. 
It 
states 
that 
the 
asymptotic 
number 
of PRIME CONSTELLATIONS can be computed 
explicitly. 
The 
second 
Hardy-Littlewood 
conjecture 
states 
that 
T(X + y) - n(x) 5 T(Y) 
for all 2 and 
y, where ITT(Z) is the PRIME COUNTING 
FUNCTION. Although 
it is not obvious, 
Richards 
(1974) 
proved 
that 
this conjecture 
is incompatible 
with the first 
Hardy-Littlewood 
conjecture.

The

derives 
its name 
from 
the following 
story 
G. II. 
Hardy 
told 
about 
Ramanujan. 
“Once, 
in the taxi 
from 
London, 
Hardy 
noticed 
its number, 
1729. 
He must 
have 
thought 
about 
it a little 
because 
he entered 
the 
room 
where Ramanujan 
lay in bed and, 
with 
scarcely 
a 
hello, 
blurted 
out his disappointment 
with 
it. It was, he 
declared, 
‘rather 
a dull 
number,’ 
adding 
that 
he hoped 
that 
wasn’t 
a bad omen. 
‘No, 
Hardy,’ 
said Ramanujan, 
‘it is a very interesting 
number. 
It is the smallest 
number 
expressible 
as the sum 
of two [POSITIVE] cubes in two 
different 
ways”’

The

NUMBER H, 
is never an INTEGER (ex- 
cept for HI), 
which 
can be proved 
by using 
the strong 
triangle 
inequality 
to show that 
the Z-ADIC VALUE of I& 
is greater 
than

Harmonic 
Series 
The 
SUM 
k=l 
(1) 
is called 
the harmonic 
series. 
It 
can 
be shown 
to DI- 
VERGE using 
the INTEGRAL TEST by comparison 
with 
the function 
l/x. 
The divergence, 
however, 
is very 
slow. 
In fact, the sum 
Ix 
1 
i 
(2) 
P 
taken 
over 
all PRIMES also diverges. 
The generalization 
of the harmonic 
series 
k=l 
is known 
as the RIEMANN ZETA FUNCTION. 
The sum 
of the first 
few 
terms 
of the harmonic 
series 
is 
given 
analytically 
by the nth HARMONIC NUMBER 
where 
y is the EULER-MASCHERONI 
CONSTANT and 
q(x)= 
$J&c) is the D~GAMMA FUNCTION. The 
number 
of terms 
needed 
to exceed 
1, 2, 3, 
are 
1, 4,

248397, 
(Sloane’s 
A004080). 
Using 
the 
analytic 
form 
shows 
ihat 
after 
2.5 x 10’ 
terms, 
the sum 
is still 
less than 
20. 
Furthermore, 
to achieve 
a sum 
greater 
than 
100, more 
than 
1.509 
x 1O43 terms 
are needed!

Hartley 
Transform 
An INTEGRAL 
TRANSFORM 
which 
shares some features 
with 
the FOURIER 
TRANSFORM, 
but 
which

of

The 
Hartley 
transform 
produces 
REAL 
output 
for a 
REAL 
input, 
and is its own inverse. 
It therefore 
can have 
computational 
advantages 
over the DISCRETE 
FOURIER 
TRANSFORM, 
although 
analytic 
expressions 
are usually 
more 
complicated 
for the Hartley 
transform.

Hartley

them 
to

sometimes 
thousands

HashLife 
takes 
tremendous 
amounts 
of memory

1. If x < y in the poset, 
then 
the point 
corresponding

lower 
in the

the point

2. The

Principle 
A collection

if, 
whenever 
one of the equations 
has solutions 
in R and 
all the &, 
then the equations 
have solutions 
in the RA-

Q. Examples 
include 
the set of equations 
ax2 + bxy + cy2 = 0 
with 
a, b, and c INTEGERS, 
and the set of equations 
EC2 +y2 
=a 
for a rational. 
The 
trivial 
solution 
zc = y = 0 is usu- 
ally 
not 
taken 
into 
account 
when 
deciding 
if a collec-

Heawood 
Conjecture 
The 
bound 
for the number 
of colors 
which 
are SUFFI- 
CIENT for MAP COLORING on a surface 
of GENUS 9, 
is the best possible, 
where [xj is the FLOOR FUNCTION. 
x(g) 
is called 
the CHROMATTC NUMBER, and the first 
few values 
for g = 0, 1, . . . are 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, 
13, 13, 14, 
. 
l 
. (Sloane’s 
A000934). 
The 
fact 
that 
x(g) 
is also NECESSARY was proved 
by 
Ringel 
and 
Youngs 
(1968) 
with 
two exceptions: 
the 
SPHERE (PLANE), 
and the KLEIN BOTTLE 
(for which 
the 
Heawood 
FORMULA gives 
seven, 
but 
the 
correct 
bound 
is six). 
When 
the FOUR-COLOR THEOREM was 
proved 
in 1976, the KLEIN BOTTLE was left as the only 
exception. 
The 
four most 
difficult 
cases to prove 
were 
g = 59, 83, 158, and 257.

Heilbronn

it must

Heegner

published 
a 
proof 
that 
only 
nine 
such numbers 
exist, 
but his proof 
was not accepted 
as complete 
at the time. 
Subsequent 
examination 
of Heegner’s 
proof 
show it to be “essen-

correct 
(Conway

The

a number

Helmholtz 
Differential 
Equation 
A PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATION 
which 
can 
be 
written 
in a SCALAR version 
V2$

= 0, 
(1) 
O~VECTOR form, 
V2A+ 
k2A= 
0, 
where 
V2 
is the 
LAPLACIAN. 
When 
k 
= 
0, 
the 
Helmholtz 
differential 
equation 
reduces 
to LAPLACE’S 
EQUATION. 
Wh en k2 < 
0, the 
equation 
becomes 
the 
space part 
of the diffusion 
equation. 
The 
Helmholtz 
differential 
equation 
can be solved 
by 
SEPARATION OF VARIABLES in only 
11 coordinate 
sys- 
tems, 
10 of which 
(with 
the 
exception 
of CONFOCAL 
PARABOLOIDAL COORDINATES) 
are

LAPLACE'S EQUATION (the 
Helmholtz 
differential 
equation 
with 
k = 0) is separa- 
ble in the two additional 
BISPHERICAL COORDINATES 
and TOROIDAL COORDINATES. 
If Helmholtz’s 
equation 
is separable 
in a 3-D coordinate 
system, 
then 
Morse 
and Feshbach 
(1953, 
pp. 509-510)

Lemma 
An important 
result 
in VALUATION THEORY which gives 
information 
on finding 
roots 
of POLYNOMIALS. Hensel’s 
lemma 
is formally 
stated 
as follow. 
Let (K, 1 
n I) be a com- 
plete 
non-Archimedean 
valuated 
field, 
and let R be the 
corresponding 
VALUATION 
RING. 
Let 
f(x) 
be a POLY- 
NOMIAL whose 
COEFFTCIENTS are in R and suppose 
~0 
satisfies 
Ifbo)l 
< lf’(a0)12, 
(1) 
where 
f’ is the (formal) 
DERIVATIVE of f. 
Then 
there 
exists 
a unique 
element 
a E R such that 
f(a) 
= 0 and 
(2) 
Less formally, 
if f(x) 
is a POLYNOMIAL with “INTEGER" 
COEFFICIENTS and f(uo) 
is “small” 
compared 
to f’(uo), 
then 
the equation 
f(x) 
= 0 has a solution 
“near” 
aa. In 
addition, 
there 
are no other 
solutions 
near a~, although 
there 
may 
be other 
solutions. 
The 
proof 
of the LEMMA 
is based around 
the Newton-Raphson 
method 
and relies 
on the non-Archimedean 
nature 
of the valuation. 
Consider 
the following 
example 
in which Hensel’s 
lemma 
is used to determine 
that 
the equation 
x2 = -I 
is solv- 
able 
in the 5-adic 
numbers 
Q 
(and 
so we can embed 
the GAUSSIAN INTEGERS inside 
Q5 in a nice way). 
Let 
Eir be the 5-adic 
numbers 
& 
let f(x) 
= x2 + 1, ‘and let 
a0 = 2. Then 
we have f(2) 
= 5 and f’(2) 
= 4, so 
lf(2)15 
= 
; 
< 
If’(2)l$ 
= 
1, 
(3) 
and the condition 
is satisfied. 
Hensel’s 
lemma 
then 
tells 
us that 
there 
is a 5-adic 
number 
a such that 
u2 + 1 = 0 
and 
I a - 215 <= 
1515 = ;. 
(4 
Similarly, 
there is a 5-adic 
number 
b such that 
b2 + 1 = 0 
and 
(b - 315 <= 
]+I5 
= ;.

Heptadecagon 
The REGULAR POLYGON of 17 sides is called 
the HEP- 
TADECAGON, 
or 
sometimes 
the 
HEPTAKAIDECAGON. 
Gauss 
proved 
in 
1796 
(when 
he was 19 years 
old) 
that 
the heptadecagon 
is CONSTRUCTIBLE with a COM- 
PASS and STRAIGHTEDGE. 
Gauss’s 
proof 
appears 
in 
his monumental 
work 
Disquisitiones 
Arithmeticae. 
The 
proof 
relies 
on the property 
of irreducible 
POLYNOMIAL 
equations 
that 
ROOTS composed 
of a finite 
number 
of 
SQUARE ROOT extractions 
only 
exist when the order 
of 
the equation 
is a product 
of the form 
2a3bF, 
l Fd 
n . . &, 
where the F. 
are distinct 
PRIMES of the form 
F, = 22n + 1, 
known 
as FERMAT PRIMES. Constructions 
for the regu- 
lar TRIANGLE (3l), 
SQUARE 
(2”), 
PENTAGON 
(2”’ +i), 
HEXAGON (2l3l), 
etc., 
had been 
given 
by Euclid, 
but 
constructions 
based on the FERMAT PRIMES 2 17 were 
unknown 
to the ancients. 
The first explicit 
construction 
of a heptadecagon 
was given 
by Erchinger 
in about 
1800.

This

has SIM-

The 
construction 
of Smith 
(1920) 
has a 
greater 
SIMPLICITY of 58. Another 
construction 
due to 
Tietze 
(1965) 
and reproduced 
in Hall 
(1970) 
has a SIM- 
PLICITY of 50. However, 
neither 
Tietze 
(1965) 
nor Hall 
(1970) 
provides 
a proof 
that 
this 
construction 
is cor- 
rect.

Richmond’s

extensive

their 
validity.

Heptahedron 
The 
regular 
heptahedron 
is a one-sided 
surface 
made 
from four TRIANGLES and three QUADRILATERALS. 
It is 
topologically 
equivalent 
to the ROMAN 
SURFACE (Wells 
1991). 
While 
all 
of the 
faces 
are 
regular 
and 
ver- 
tices equivalent, 
the heptahedron 
is self-intersecting 
and 
is therefore 
not 
considered 
an ARCHIMEDEAN 
SOLID. 
There 
are three 
semiregular 
heptahedra: 
the pentago- 
nal and pentagrammic 
PRISMS, and a FACETED OCTA- 
HEDRON 
(Holden 
1991).

Matrix 
If a MATRIX 
is SELF-ADJOINT, 
it is said to be a Hermi-

matrix. 
Therefore, 
a Hermitian 
MATRIX 
is defined 
as one for which

Hermitian 
MA- 
TRICES 
have 
REAL 
EIGENVALUES 
with 
ORTHOGONAL 
EIGENVECTORS. 
For REAL 
MATRICES, 
Hermitian 
is the 
same as symmetrical. 
Any MATRIX 
C which 
is not Her- 
mitian 
can be expressed 
as the sum 
of two Hermitian 
matrices 
C = +<c + c+> + $(C - c+>.

Let U be a UNITARY

and A be a Hermitian

Then 
the ADJOINT

(MU-‘)+

The 
proof 
of this fact was discovered 
by Heron 
(ca. 100 
BC-100 
AD), 
although 
it was already 
known 
to Arch- 
imedes 
prior 
to 212 BC 
(Kline 
1972). 
Heron’s 
proof 
(Dunham 
1990) 
is ingenious 
but 
extremely 
convoluted, 
bringing 
together 
a sequence 
of apparently 
unrelated 
geometric 
identities 
and 
relying 
on the 
properties 
of 
CYCLIC QUADRILATERALS and RIGHT 
TRIANGLES. 
Heron’s 
proof 
can be found 
in Proposition 
1.8 of his work 
Metrica. 
This 
manuscript 
had 
been 
lost 
for centuries 
until 
a fragment 
was discovered 
in 1894 and a complete 
copy 
in 1896 
(Dunham 
1990, 
p. 118). 
More 
recently, 
writings 
of the Arab 
scholar 
Abu’l 
Raihan 
Muhammed 
al-Biruni 
have credited 
the formula 
to Heron’s 
predeces- 
sor Archimedes 
(Dunham 
1990, p. 127). 
A much 
more 
accessible 
algebraic 
proof 
proceeds 
from 
the LAW OF COSINES, 
Then 
cosA = b2 + c2 - a2 
2bc 
l 
(7) 
sinA 
= 
-a4 
- b4 - c4 + 2b2c2 + 2c2a2 + 2a2b2 
2bc 
1 (8) 
giving 
A= 
+bcsinA 
(9) 
- b4 - c4 + 2b2c2 + 2c2a2 + 2a2b2 
(10) 
= +[(a + b + c)(-a 
+ b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)]li2 
(11) 
s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) 
(12) 
(Coxeter 
1969).

Heronian 
Triangle 
A TRIANGLE 
with 
RATIONAL side lengths 
and RATIO- 
NAL AREA. 
Brahmagupta 
gave a parametric 
solution 
for integer 
Heronian 
triangles 
(the three side lengths 
and 
area can be multiplied 
by their LEAST COMMON MULTI- 
PLE to make 
them 
all INTEGERS): side lengths 
c(a2+b2), 
b(a2 + c2), and (b + c)(a2 - bc), 
giving 
SEMIPERIMETER 
s=a”(b+c) 
and AREA 
A = abc(a + b)(a2 - bc). 
The 
first few integer 
Hernonian 
triangles, 
sorted 
by in- 
creasing 
maximal 
side lengths, 
are (3, 4, 5), (6, 8, lo), 
(5, 
12, 13), (9, 12, 15), (4, 13, 15), (13, 14, 15), (9, 10, 17), 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A046128, 
A046129, 
and A046130), 
having 
areas 6, 24, 30, 54, 24, 84, 36, . . . (Sloane’s 
A046131). 
Schubert 
(1905) 
claimed 
that 
Heronian 
triangles 
with 
two rational 
MEDIANS 
do not exist (Dickson 
1952). 
This 
was shown 
to be incorrect 
by Buchholz 
and 
Rathbun 
(1997), 
who discovered 
six such triangles.

A heterosquare 
is an n x n ARRAY

have

(By contrast, 
in a MAGIC

they 
have the same sum.) 
There 
are no heterosquares 
of order 
two, but 
heterosquares 
of every 
ODD 
order 
exist. 
They 
can be constructed 
by placing 
consecutive 
INTEGERS 
in

pattern 
(Fults

ICOSAHEDRON cuts the 
solid 
in 
a regular 
HEXAGONAL CROSS-SECTION (Holden 
1991, 
pp. 
22-23 
and 
27). 
For the CUBE, the PLANE passes 
through 
the MIDPOINTS 
of opposite 
sides 
(Steinhaus 
1983, 
p. 170; Cundy 
and 
Rollett 
1989, p. 157; Holden 
1991, pp. 22-23). 
Since there 
are four such axes for the 
CUBE and OCTAHEDRON, there are four possibly 
hexag- 
onal 
cross-sections. 
Since 
there 
are four 
such axes in 
each case, there 
are also four possibly 
hexagonal 
cross- 
sections. 
Take seven CIRCLES and close-pack 
them 
together 
in a 
hexagonal 
arrangement. 
The PERIMETER obtained 
by 
wrapping 
a band 
around 
the CIRCLE then 
consists 
of 
six straight 
segments 
of length 
d (where d is the DIAME- 
TER) and 6 arcs with 
total 
length 
l/6 
of a CIRCLE. The 
PERIMETER is therefore 
p = (12 + 24r 
= 2(6 + n)r.

Hilbert’s 
Problems 
A set of (originally) 
unsolved 
problems 
in mathematics 
proposed 
by Hilbert. 
Of the 23 total, 
ten were presented 
at the Second 
International 
Congress 
in Paris 
in 1900. 
These 
problems 
were designed 
to serve as examples 
for 
the kinds 
of problems 
whose solutions 
would 
lead to the 
furthering 
of disciplines 
in mathematics.

Is there 
a transfinite 
number 
between 
that 
of a 
DENUMERABLE SET and the numbers 
of the CON- 
TINUUM? 
This 
question 
was answered 
by Gijdel 
and Cohen 
to the effect that 
the answer depends 
on the 
particular 
version 
of SET THEORY as- 
sumed. 
lb .

Can the CONTINWUM of numbers 
be considered 
a 
WELL-ORDERED 
SET ? 
This 
question 
is related 
to Zermelo’s 
AXIOM 
OF CHOICE. 
In 
1963, 
the 
AXIOM OF CHOICE was demonstrated 
to be inde- 
pendent 
of all other 
AXIOMS 
in SET THEORY, 
so 
there 
appears 
to be no universally 
valid 
solution 
to this 
question 
either. 
Can it be proven 
that 
the AXIOMS of logic are con- 
sistent? 
G~DEL'S INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM 
indicated 
that 
the 
answer 
is “no,”

A Hilbert

such that

Examples 
of FINITE-dimensional 
Hilbert 
spaces include

An example 
of an INFINITE-dimensional 
Hilbert 
space is

In this 
case, the INNER PRODUCT 
is

The upper 
and lower hinges 
are descriptive 
statistics 
of 
a set of N data 
values, 
where 
N is of the form 
Iv = 
4n+ 
5 with 
n = 0, 1, 2, . l . l The hinges 
are obtained 
by 
ordering 
the 
data 
in increasing 
order 
al, 
l . . , UN, and 
writing 
them 
out 
in the shape 
of a “w” 
as illustrated 
above. 
The 
values 
at the 
bottom 
legs are called 
the 
hinges 
HI 
and Hz (and the central 
peak is the MEDIAN). 
In this ordering, 
HI 
= 
an+2 
= 
U(Iv+3)/4 
For N of the form 
4n + 5, the hinges 
are identical 
to 
the 
QUARTILES. 
The 
difference 
Hz - HI 
is called 
the 
H-SPREAD.

Algorithm 
An

for 
finding 
INTEGER RELATIONS whose 
running 
time 
is bounded 
by a polynomial 
in the num- 
ber of real variables. 
It is much 
faster 
than 
other 
algo- 
rithms 
such 
as the FERGUSON-FORCADE ALGORITHM, 
LLL 
ALGORITHM, 
andPSOS 
ALGORITHM. 
Unfortunately, 
it is numerically 
unstable 
and 
therefore 
requires 
extremely 
high 
precision. 
The 
cause 
of this 
in- 
stability 
is not known 
(Ferguson 
and Bailey 
1992), 
but is 
believed 
to derive 
from 
its reliance 
on GRAM-SCHMIDT 
ORTHONORMALIZATION, 
which 
is know 
to 
be numeri- 
cally 
unstable 
(Golub

For example,

Hole 
Hole 
A hole 
in a mathematical 
object 
is a TOPOLOGICAL 
structure 
which 
prevents 
the object 
from 
being 
contin- 
uously 
shrunk 
to a point. 
When 
dealing 
with 
TOPO- 
LOGICAL SPACES, a DISCONNECTIVITY 
is interpreted 
as 
a hole 
in the space. 
Examples 
of holes 
are things 
like 
the hole in the 
“center” 
of a SPHERE or a CIRCLE and 
the hole produced 
in EUCLIDEAN SPACE cutting 
a KNOT 
out from 
it. 
Home 
Plate 
Homeomorphic

Singular 
HOMOLOGY GROUPS form 
a MEASURE of the 
hole 
structure 
of a SPACE, but 
they 
are one particu- 
lar measure 
and they 
don’t 
always 
pick 
up everything. 
HOMOTOPY GROUPS of a SPACE are another 
measure 
of holes 
in a SPACE, as well 
as BORDISM GROUPS, k- 
THEORY,~OHOMOTOPY 
GROUPS, and 
SO on. 
There 
are 
many 
ways to 
measure 
holes 
in 
a space. 
Some 
holes are picked 
up by HOMOTOPY 
GROUPS that 
are not 
picked 
up by HOMOLOGY GROUPS, and 
some 
holes 
are picked 
up 
by EIOMOLOGY GROUPS that 
are 
not picked 
up by HOMOT~PY GROUPS. (For example, 
in the TORUS, HOMOTOPY GROUPS “miss” 
the 
two- 
dimensional 
hole that 
is given 
by the TORUS itself, 
but 
the second HOMOLOGY GROUP picks 
that 
hole 
up.) 
In 
addition, 
HOMOLOGY GROUPS don’t 
pick 
up 
the vary- 
ing hole 
structures 
of the complement- 
of KNOTS 
in 3- 
space, but the first HOMOTOPY GROUP (the fundamen- 
tal group) 
does.

Homeoid 
A shell 
bounded 
by two similar 
ELLIPSOIDS having 
a 
constant 
ratio 
of axes. Given 
a CHORD passing 
through 
a homeoid, 
the distance 
between 
inner 
and outer 
inter- 
sections 
is equal 
on both 
sides. 
Since 
a spherical 
shell 
is a symmetric 
case of a homeoid, 
this 
theorem

true

The most

Two 
objects 
are homeomorphic 
if 
they 
can be deformed 
into 
each other 
by a continuous, 
invertible 
mapping. 
Homeomorphism 
ignores 
the space 
in which 
surfaces 
are embedded, 
so the deformation 
can 
be completed 
in a higher 
dimensional 
space than 
the 
surface 
was originally 
embedded. 
MIRROR IMAGES are 
homeomorphic, 
as are MOBIUS BANDS with 
an EVEN 
number 
of half twists, 
and MOBIUS BANDS with an ODD 
number 
of twists. 
In 
CATEGORY THEORY terms, 
homeomorphisms

SPACES and continuous 
maps.

HOMFLY 
Polynomial 
A 2-variable 
oriented 
KNOT POLYNOMIAL PL(a,z) 
mo- 
tivated 
by the JONES POLYNOMIAL (fieyd 
et al. 1985). 
Its 
name 
is an acronym 
for the 
last 
names 
of its co- 
discoverers: 
Hoste, 
Ocneanu, 
Millett, 
Freyd, 
Lickorish, 
and Yetter 
(Freyd 
et al. 1985). 
Independent 
work 
re- 
lated 
to the HOMFLY 
polynomial 
was 
also carried 
out 
by Prztycki 
and naczyk 
(1987). 
HOMFLY 
polynomial 
is defined 
by the SKEIN RELATIONSHIP 
a-lP~+ 
(a, z) - aPL_ 
(a, x) = ZPL, 
(a, z) 
(1) 
(Doll 
and Hoste 
1991), 
where 2t is sometimes 
written 
in- 
stead of a (Kanenobu 
and Sumi 
1993) or, with 
a slightly 
diBerent 
relationship, 
as 
cyPL+ (111, x) - a-lPL- 
(a, z) = XP& 
(a, 2) 
(2) 
(Kauffman 
1991). 
It is also defined 
as pL(& 
m) 
in terms 
of SKEIN RELATIONSHIP 
!PL+ 
+ !-lp,- 
+ mPL, 
= 0 
(3) 
(Lickorish 
and 
Millett 
1988). 
It can be regarded 
as a 
nonhomogeneous 
POLYNOMIAL in two variables 
or a ho- 
mogeneous 
POLYNOMIAL in three 
variables. 
In three 
variables 
the SKEIN RELATIONSHIP is written 
x~L+(x,Y,z)+ 
YPL-(X&Z) 
+ ~PL&,Y,~) 
= 
0. 
(4) 
HOMFLY 
Polynomial 
It is normalized 
so that 
&&not 
= 1. Also, for n unlinked 
unknotted 
components, 
PL(X, 
y,z) 
= 
(-yn-l 
l 
(5) 
This 
POLYNOMIAL usually 
detects 
CHIRALITY 
but does 
not 
detect 
the 
distinct 
ENANTIOMERS of the 
KNOTS 
09042, 
10048, 
10071, 
10091, 
10104, 
and 
10125 
(Jones 1987). 
The 
HOMFLY 
polynomial 
of an oriented 
KNOT is the 
same if the orientation 
is reversed. 
It is a generalization 
of the JONES POLYNOMIAL V(t), 
satisfying 
v(t) 
= P(a 
= t, z = tli2 
- t-1’2) 
(6) 
v(t) 
= P@ = it-l,m 
= i(t-1’2 
- t’/“))* 
(7) 
It is also a generalization 
of the ALEXANDER POLYNOM- 
IAL v(z), 
satisfying 
A(Z) 
= P(a 
= 1, z = t1’2 - t 
-l/2 
). 
(8) 
TheHOMFLY 
POLYNOMIAL of the MIRROR IMAGEK* 
of a KNOT K is given 
by 
Pp 
(e, m) = P&e-‘, 
m), 
(9) 
so P usually 
but 
not always 
detects 
CHIRALITY. 
A split 
union 
of two links 
(i.e., 
bringing 
two links 
to 
gether 
without 
intertwining 
them) 
has H0MFLY 
poly 
nomial 
P(L1 
U L2) 
= -(t 
+ C-l)mD1P(L1)P(L2). 
(10 
Also, 
the composition 
of two links 
P(L#Lz) 
=P(L1)P(L2), 
(11) 
so the POLYNOMIAL of a COMPOSXTE KNOT factors 
into 
POLYNOMIALS of its constituent 
knots 
(Adams 
1994). 
MUTANTS have 
the 
same 
HOMFLY 
polynomials. 
In 
fact, 
there 
are 
infinitely 
many 
distinct 
KNOTS with 
the 
same 
HOMFLY 
POLYNOMIAL (Kanenobu 
1986). 
Examples 
include 
(05001, 
l&32), 
(08008, 
10129) 
(08016, 
10156), 
and 
(10025, 
10056) 
(Jones 
1987). 
Incidentally, 
these also have the same JONES POLYNOMIAL. 
M. B. Thistlethwaite 
has tabulated 
the HOMFLY 
poly- 
nomial 
for KNOTS up to 13 crossings.

Homoclinic 
Point 
A point 
where a stable 
and an unstable 
separatrix 
(in- 
variant 
manifold) 
from 
the 
same 
fixed 
point 
or same 
family 
intersect. 
Therefore, 
the limits 
lim 
f”(X) 
k+oo 
and 
lim 
f”(X) 
k-+-m 
exist 
and are equal. 
Refer 
to the 
above 
figure. 
Let 
X 
be the 
point 
of in- 
tersection, 
with 
X1 ahead 
of X on one MANIFOLD 
and 
X2 ahead 
of X of the other. 
The 
mapping 
of each of 
these points 
TX1 
and TX2 
must 
be ahead 
of the map- 
ping 
of X, TX. 
The 
only 
way this can happen 
is if the 
MANIFOLD 
loops 
back and crosses itself 
at a new homo- 
clinic 
point. 
Another 
loop 
must 
be formed, 
with 
T2X 
another 
homoclinic 
point. 
Since T2X 
is closer to the hy- 
perbolic 
point 
than 
TX, 
the distance 
between 
T2X 
and 
TX 
is less than 
that 
between 
X and TX. 
Area preser- 
vation 
requires 
the AREA 
to remain 
the same, 
so each 
new curve (which 
is closer than 
the previous 
one) must 
extend 
further. 
In effect, 
the loops 
become 
longer 
and 
thinner. 
The network 
of curves leading 
to a dense AREA 
of homoclinic 
points 
is known 
as a homoclinic 
tangle 
or 
tendril. 
Homoclinic 
points

Poincare 
showed 
that 
if there 
is a single 
homo- 
clinic 
point, 
there 
are an infinite 
number. 
More 
specifi- 
cally, there 
are infinitely 
many

Homology 
Group 
The 
term 
“homology 
group” 
usually 
means 
a singular 
homology 
group, 
which 
is an ABELIAN 
GROUP which 
partially 
counts 
the number 
of HOLES in a TOPOLOG- 
ICAL SPACE. In particular, 
singular 
homology 
groups 
form 
a MEASURE of the HOLE 
structure 
of a SPACE, but 
they 
are one particular 
measure 
and they 
don’t 
always 
pick up everything. 
In 
addition, 
there 
are 
“generalized 
homology 
groups” 
which 
are not singular 
homology 
groups. 
Homology 
(Topology) 
Historically, 
the term 
“homology” 
was first 
used in a 
topological 
sense by Poincar6. 
To him, 
it meant 
pretty 
much 
what 
is now called 
a COBORDISM, meaning 
that 
a homology 
was thought 
of as a relation 
between 
MAN- 
IFOLDS mapped 
into 
a MANIFOLD. 
Such MANIFOLDS 
form 
a homology 
when 
they 
form 
the 
boundary 
of a 
higher-dimensional 
MANIFOLD inside 
the MANIFOLD in 
question. 
To simplify 
the 
definition 
of homology, 
Poincar6 
sim- 
plified 
the spaces he dealt 
with. 
He assumed 
that 
all 
the spaces he dealt 
with 
had 
a triangulation 
(i.e., 
they 
were “SIMPLICIAL COMPLEXES"). Then 
instead 
oftalk- 
i,ng about 
general 
“objects” 
in these spaces, he restricted 
himself 
to subcomplexes, 
i.e., objects 
in the space made 
up only 
on the simplices 
in the TRIANGULATION 
of the 
space. 
Eventually, 
PoincarG’s 
version 
of homology 
was 
dispensed 
with and replaced 
by the more 
general 
SINGU- 
LAR HOMOLOGY. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY istheconcept 
mathematicians 
mean 
when they 
say “homology.” 
In modern 
usage, however, 
the word homology 
is used to 
mean HOMOLOGY GROUP. For example, 
if someone 
says 
“X 
did Y by computing 
the homology 
of 2,” 
they mean 
“X 
did Y by computing 
the HOMOLOGY GROUPS of 2.” 
l3ut 
sometimes 
homology 
is used 
more 
loosely 
in the 
context 
of a “homology 
in a SPACE," which 
corresponds 
to sing&r 
homology 
groups. 
Singular 
homology 
groups 
of a SPACE measure 
the ex- 
tent 
to which 
there 
are finite 
(compact) 
boundaryless 
GADGETS in that SPACE, suchthatthese 
GADGETS are 
not the boundary 
of other 
finite 
(compact) 
GADGETS in 
that 
SPACE.

Homothetic 
Two figures are homothetic 
if they are related 
by a DILA- 
TION (a dilation 
is also known 
as a HOMOTHECY). This 
means 
that 
they 
lie in the same 
plane 
and correspond- 
ing 
sides are PARALLEL; such figures 
have 
connectors 
of corresponding 
points 
which 
are CONCURRENT at a 
point 
known 
as the HOMOTHETIC 
CENTER. 
The 
HO- 
MOTHETIC CENTER divides 
each connector 
in the same 
ratio 
k, known 
as the SIMILITUDE 
RATIO. 
For figures 
which 
are similar 
but 
do not have PARALLEL sides, a 
SIMILITUDE CENTER exists.

In general, 
a hyperbola 
is defined 
as the 
LOCUS 
of all 
points 
in the 
PLANE 
the 
difference 
of whose 
distance 
from 
two fixed 
points 
(the 
FOCI 
Fl 
and Fz) separated 
by a distance

’ 
Unlike 
the ELLIPSE, 
no points 
of the hyperbola 
actually 
lie on the 
SEMIMINOR 
AXIS, 
but 
rather 
the ratio 
b/a 
determined 
the vertical 
scaling 
of the hyperbola. 
The 
ECCENTRICITY 
of the hyperbola 
is defined 
as

a2

In the standard 
equation 
of the hyperbola, 
the center 
is 
located 
at (~0, yo), the FOCI 
are at (50 * c, yo), and the 
vertices are at (~0 41 a, 30). 
The 
so-called 
ASYMPTOTES 
(shown 
as the dashed 
lines 
in the above figures) 
can be 
found 
by substituting 
0 for the 1 on the right 
side of the 
general 
equation

b 
Y = k-(x 
- x0) + yo, 
a 
and therefore 
have SLOPES

The special 
case a = b (the left diagram 
above) 
is known 
as a RIGHT 
HYPERBOLA 
because 
the ASYMPTOTES 
are 
PERPENDICULAR.

The 
special 
case of the 
RIGHT 
HYPERBOLA 
was first 
studied 
by Menaechmus. 
Euclid 
and 
Aristaeus 
wrote 
about 
the 
general 
hyperbola, 
but 
only 
studied 
one 
branch 
of it. The 
hyperbola 
was given 
its present 
name 
by Apollonius, 
who was the first to study 
both 
branches. 
The FOCUS and DIRECTRIX 
were considered 
by Pappus 
(MacTutor 
Archive). 
The 
hyperbola 
is the shape of an 
orbit 
of a body 
on an escape 
trajectory 
(i.e., 
a body

Evolute 
Hyperbolic 
Automorphism 
with 
positive 
energy), 
such 
as some 
comets, 
about 
a 
fixed mass, 
such as the sun. 
The LOCUS of the apex 
of a variable 
CONE 
containing 
an ELLIPSE fixed 
in 3-space 
is a hyperbola 
through 
the 
FOCI of the 
ELLIPSE. 
In 
addition, 
the LOCUS of the 
apex 
of a CONE 
containing 
that 
hyperbola 
is the origi- 
nal 
ELLIPSE. 
Furthermore, 
the ECCENTRICITIES of the 
ELLIPSE and hyperbola 
are reciprocals.

The

coth 
(HYPERBOLIC SINE, HYPERBOLIC COSINE, 
etc.) 
share 
many 
properties 
with 
the corresponding 
CIRCW-

The 
hyperbolic 
functions 
arise 
in 
many 
problems 
of mathematics 
and mathematical 
phys- 
ics in which 
integrals 
involving 
Jm 
arise 
(whereas 
the CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS involve 
di??). 
For instance, 
the HYPERBOLIC 
SINE 
arises in the grav- 
itational 
potential 
of a cylinder 
and the calculation 
of 
the Roche 
limit. 
The 
HYPERBOLIC 
COSINE 
function 
is 
the shape of a hanging 
cable 
(the so-called 
CATENARY). 
The HYPERBOLIC TANGENT arises in the calculation 
of 
magnetic 
moment 
and rapidity 
of special 
relativity. 
All 
three 
appear 
in the Schwarzschild 
metric 
using 
exter- 
nal isotropic 
Kruskal 
coordinates 
in general 
relativity. 
The HYPERBOLIC SECANT arises in the profile 
of a lam- 
inar 
jet. 
The 
HYPERBOLIC COTANGENT arises 
in the 
Langevin 
function 
for magnetic 
polarization.

A NON-EUCLIDEAN 
GEOMETRY, also called LOBACHEV-

GEOMETRY, having 
constant 
SEC- 
TIONAL CURVATURE -1. 
This 
GEOMETRY satisfies 
all 
of EUCLID'S POSTULATES except 
the PARALLEL POSTU- 
LATE, which is modified 
to read: 
For any infinite 
straight 
LINE L and any POINT P not on it, there are many

extending 
straight 
LINES that 
pass through 
P 
and which 
do not intersect

In hyperbolic 
geometry, 
the sum of ANGLES of a TRI- 
ANGLE is less than 
180”, 
and TRIANGLES with 
the same 
angles 
have the same areas. 
Furthermore, 
not all TRI- 
ANGLES have the same ANGLE sum (c.f. the AAA 
THE- 
OREM for TRIANGLES 
in Euclidean 
2-space). 
The 
best- 
known 
example 
of a hyperbolic 
space are SPHERES in 
Lorentzian 
4-space. 
The POINCAR~ HYPERBOLIC DISK 
is a hyperbolic 
2-space. 
Hyperbolic 
geometry 
is well un- 
derstood 
in 2-D, but 
not in 3-D. 
Geometric 
models 
of hyperbolic

the 
KLEIN-BELTRAMI 
MODEL, which 
consists 
of an OPEN 
DISK in the Euclidean 
plane 
whose open 
chords 
corre- 
spond 
to hyperbolic 
lines. 
A 2-D model 
is the POINCAR~ 
HYPERBOLIC 
DISK. 
Felix 
Klein 
constructed 
an analytic 
hyperbolic

in 1870 in which 
a POINT is repre- 
sented

Hyperbolic 
Knot 
A hyperbolic 
knot is a KNOT that 
has a complement 
that 
can be given 
a metric 
of constant 
curvature 
-1. 
The 
only KNOTS which are not hyperbolic 
are TORUS KNOTS 
and SATELLITE KNOTS (including 
COMPOSITE KNOTS), 
as proved 
by Thurston 
in 1978. 
Therefore, 
all but six of 
the PRIME KNOTS with 
10 or fewer crossings 
are hyper- 
bolic. 
The 
exceptions 
with 
nine 
or fewer crossings 
are 
03001 (the(3, 
2)-TORUS 
KNOT), 
05001, 07001, 08019 (the 
(4, 3)-TORUS 
KNOT), and OQOOl. 
Almost 
all 
hyperbolic 
knots 
can be distinguished 
by 
their 
hyperbolic 
volumes 
(exceptions 
being 
05002 and a 
certain 
12-crossing 
knot; 
see Adams 
1994, p. 124). 
It has 
been conjectured 
that 
the smallest 
hyperbolic 
volume 
is 
2.0298.. 
. , that 
of the FIGURE-OF-EIGHT 
KNOT. 
MUTANT KNOTS have the same hyperbolic 
knot 
volume.

may 
be one- 
or two-

Hypercube 
*GO 
The 
generalization 
of a 3-CUBE 
to n-D, 
also called 
a 
MEASURE 
POLYTOPE. 
It is a regular 
POLYTOPE with 
mutually 
PERPENDICULAR sides, and is therefore 
an OR- 
THOTOPE. It is denoted 
yn and has SCHL~FLI SYMBOL 
(4, 3,3 }. 
The 
number 
of k-cubes 
contained 
in an n- 
n-2 
cube can be found 
from 
the COEFFICIENTS of (2k + 1)“. 
Y 
The 
l-hypercube 
is a LINE SEGMENT, the 2-hypercube 
is the SQUARE, and the 3-hypercube 
is the CUBE. The 
hypercube 
in R4, calleda 
TESSERACT, hasthe 
SCHL~FLI 
SYMBOL {4,3,3} 
and VERTICES (fl, 
&l, 
&l, 
hl). 
The 
above figures 
show two visualizations 
of the TESSERACT. 
The figure 
on the left is a projection 
of the TESSERACT 
in 3-space 
(Gardner 
1977), 
and the figure 
on the right 
is 
the GRAPH of the TESSERACT symmetrically 
projected 
into 
the PLANE (Coxeter 
1973). 
A TESSERACT 
has 16 
VERTICES, 
32 EDGES, four SQUARES, and eight 
CUBES.

The

called 
the 
n-sphere) 
is a generalization 
of the 
CIRCLE 
(n = 2) and 
SPHERE 
(n = 3) to dimensions 
n > 4. It is therefore 
defined 
as

Strangely

solutions 
are n =

As a result, 
the

have MAXIMAL

SURFACE

CONTENT, 
respectively 
(Le Lion-

The equation

is 
ds2 = R2 [dQ2 + sin2 $(dqS2 + sin2 4 de”)]. 
(16) 
By 
defining 
T =

the LINE ELEMENT can be 
rewritten 
ds2 =

Hypersphere 
Packing 
Draw unit 
n-spheres 
in an n-D 
space centered 
at all kl 
coordinates. 
Then 
place an additional 
HYPERSPHERE 
at 
the origin 
tangent 
to the other 
HYPERSPHERES. 
Then 
the 
central 
HYPERSPHERE 
is contained 
with 
the 
HY- 
PERSPHERE 
with 
VERTICES 
at the center 
of the other 
spheres 
for n between 
2 and 8. However, 
for n = 9, the 
central 
HYPERSPHERE 
just 
touches 
the 
bounding 
HY- 
PERSPHERE, 
and for n > 9, the 
HYPERSPHERE 
is par- 
tially 
outside 
the hypercube. 
This can be seen by finding 
the distance 
from 
the origin 
to the center 
of one of the 
HYPERSPHERES 
&&1)2 
+ . . . + (f1)2

L

The radius 
of the central 
sphere is therefore 
fi- 
1. The 
distance 
from 
the origin 
to the center 
of the bounding 
hypercube 
is always 2 (two radii), 
so the center 
HYPER- 
SPHERE 
is tangent 
when 
fi 
- 1 = 2, or n = 9, and 
outside 
for n > 9. 
The analog 
of face-centered 
cubic 
packing 
is the densest 
lattice 
in 4- and 5-D. 
In 8-D, the densest 
lattice 
packing 
is made up of two copies of face-centered 
cubic. 
In 6- and 
7-Q 
the densest 
lattice 
packings 
are cross-sections 
of the 
8-D case. 
In 24-Q 
the densest 
packing 
appears 
to be 
the LEECH 
LATTICE. 
For high 
dimensions 
(- 
1000-D), 
the densest 
known 
packings 
are nonlattice. 
The densest 
lattice 
packings 
in n-D

proved 
to 
have PACKING DENSITY 1, r/(2&),

Hypocycloid 
The 
curve 
produced 
by a small 
C IRCLE of RADIUS b 
rolling 
aro und 
the inside 
of a large 
CIRCLE of RADIUS 
a > b. A hypocycloid 
is a HYPOTROCHOID with 
h = 
b. To derive 
the equations 
of the hypocycloid, 
call the 
ANGLE by which 
a point 
on the small 
CIRCLE rotates 
about 
its center 
0, and 
the ANGLE from 
the center 
of 
the large CIRCLE to that 
of the small 
CIRCLE 4. Then 
(a - b)qb = 629, 
(1) 
Call 
p E a - 2b. 
If z(O) 
= p, then 
the 
first 
point 
is 
at minimum 
radius, 
and the Cartesian 
parametric 
equa- 
tions 
of the hypocycloid 
are 
x=(u-b)cosqLbcos6 
=(a-b)cos+bcos 
(3) 
y=(a-b)sin#+bsin# 
= (a-b)sin4+bsin(q@). 
(4) 
If x(0) = a instead 
so the first point 
is at maximum 
ra- 
dius (on the CIRCLE), then the equations 
of the hypocy- 
cloid 
are 
The 
largest 
number 
of unit 
CIRCLES which 
can touch 
another 
is six. 
For SPHERES, the maximum 
number 
is 
12. Newton 
considered 
this question 
long before 
a proof 
was published 
in 1874. The maximum 
number 
of hyper- 
spheres 
that 
can touch 
another 
in n-D 
is the so-called 
KISSING NUMBER.

A 3-cusped 
hypocycloid 
is called 
a DELTOID 
or TRICUS- 
POID, 
and a 4-cusped 
hypocycloid 
is called 
an ASTROID. 
If a/b 
is rational, 
the curve 
closes on itself 
and has b 
cusps. 
If a/b is IRRATIONAL, 
the curve 
never closes and 
fills the entire 
interior 
of the CIRCLE. 
n-hypocycloids 
can also 
be constructed 
by beginning 
with 
the DIAMETER 
of a CIRCLE, 
offsetting 
one end by 
a series of steps 
while 
at the 
same 
time 
offsetting 
the 
other 
end by steps n times 
as large 
in the opposite 
di- 
rection 
and extending 
beyond 
the edge of the CIRCLE. 
After 
traveling 
around 
the 
CIRCLE 
once, 
an n-cusped 
hypocycloid 
is produced, 
as illustrated 
above 
(Madachy 
1979). 
Let T be the radial 
distance 
from 
a fixed point. 
For RA- 
DIUS OF TORSION 
p and ARC LENGTH 
s,ahypocycloid 
can given 
by the equation 
s2 + p2 = 16r2

(Kreyszig 
1991, pp. 63-64).

can be computed 
as follows

A PLATONIC 
SOLID (P5) with 
12 VERTICES, 30 EDGES, 
and 20 equivalent 
EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE faces 20{3}. 
It is described 
by the SCHL~FLI SYMBOL {3,5}. 
It is 
also UNIFORM POLYHEDRON U22 and 
has WYTHOFF 
SYMBOL 5 123. The 
icosahedron

A plane PERPENDICULAR to a Cs axis of an icosahedron 
cuts the solid in a regular 
DECAGONAL CROSS-SECTION 
(Holden 
1991, pp, 24-25). 
A construction 
for an icosahedron 
with 
side length

places the end vertices 
at (O,O, IN)

the central 
vertices

giving 
coordinates

Explicitly, 
these 
coordinates

By 
a suitable 
rotation, 
the VERTICES of an icosahe- 
dron 
of side length 
2 can also be placed 
at (0, IQ, 
H), 
(~411~0, *$), 
and (@, &l, 
0), where 4 is the GOLDEN 
RATIO. These 
points 
divide 
the EDGES of an OCTAHE- 
DRON into 
segments 
with 
lengths 
in the ratio 
4 : 1. 
The DUAL POLYHEDRON of the icosahedron 
is the Do- 
DECAHEDRON. There 
are 59 distinct 
icosahedra 
when 
each TRIANGLE is colored 
differently 
(Coxeter 
1969). 
To derive 
the VOLUME of an icosahedron 
having 
edge

the orientation 
so that 
two VERTICES 
are oriented 
on top

Stellations 
Applying 
the STELLATION 
process 
to the ICOSAHEDRON 
gives 
20 + 30 + 60 + 20 + 60 + 120 + 12 + 30 + 60 + 60 
cells of ten different 
shapes 
and sizes in addition 
to the 
ICOSAHEDRON 
itself. 
After 
application 
of five restric- 
tions 
due to 5. C. P. Miller 
to define 
which forms 
should 
be considered 
distinct, 
59 stellations 
are found 
to be 
possible. 
Miller’s 
restrictions 
are 
1. The 
faces must 
lie in the twenty 
bounding 
planes 
of 
the icosahedron. 
2. The parts 
of the faces in the twenty 
planes 
must 
be 
congruent, 
but those 
parts 
lying 
in one place may be 
disconnected. 
3. The 
parts 
lying 
in one plane 
must 
have 
threefold 
rotational 
symmetry 
with 
or without 
reflections, 
4. All 
parts 
must 
be accessible, 
i.e., lie on the outside 
of the solid. 
5. Compounds 
are excluded 
that 
can be divided 
into 
two sets, each of which 
has the full 
symmetry 
of the 
whole. 
Of these, 
32 have full icosahedral 
symmetry 
and 27 are 
ENANTIOMERIC 
forms.

Ideal 
A subset 
1 of elements 
in a RING 
R which 
forms 
an 
additive 
GROUP 
and has the property 
that, 
whenever 
II: 
belongs 
to R and y belongs 
to 1, then ~:y and ylt: belong 
to 1. For example, 
the set of EVEN INTEGERS 
is an ideal 
in the RING 
of INTEGERS. 
Given 
an ideal 
I, it is possible 
to define 
a FACTOR 
RING 
R/I. 
An ideal 
may be viewed 
as a lattice 
and specified 
as the 
finite 
list of algebraic 
integers 
that 
form 
a basis for the 
lattice. 
Any two bases for the same 
lattice 
are equiva- 
lent. 
Ideals 
have multiplication, 
and this is basically 
the 
Kronecker 
product 
of the two bases. 
For any ideal 
I, there 
is an ideal 
1i such that 
-- 
l& 
= 2, 
where 
z is a PRINCIPAL 
IDEAL, 
(i.e., 
an ideal 
of rank 
1). Moreover 
there 
is a finite 
list 
of ideals 
pi such that 
this 
equation 
may 
be satisfied 
for every 
I. 
The 
size of 
this list is known 
as the CLASS NUMBER. 
In effect, the 
above 
relation 
imposes 
an EQUIVALENCE 
RELATION 
on 
ideals, 
and the 
number 
of ideals 
modulo 
this 
relation 
is the 
class number. 
When 
the 
CLASS 
NUMBER 
is 1, 
the corresponding 
number 
RING 
has unique 
factoriza- 
tion 
and, 
in a sense, the class number 
is a measure 
of 
the failure 
of unique 
factorization 
in the original 
number 
ring. 

Ideal 
Number 
Dedekind 
(1871) 
showed 
that 
every 
NONZERO 
ideal 
in 
the domain 
of INTEGERS 
of a FIELD 
is a unique 
product 
of PRIME 
IDEALS.

Incenter 
The center I of a TRIANGLE'S INCIRCLE. It can be found 
as the intersection 
of ANGLE BISECTORS, and it is the 
interior 
point 
for which 
distances 
to the 
sidelines 
are 
equal. 
Its TRILINEAR 
COORDINATES are 1:l:l. 
The 
distance 
between 
the 
incenter 
and CIRCUMCENTER is 
@(KZJ. 
The 
incenter 
lies on the EULER LINE only 
for an ISOS- 
CELES TRIANGLE. 
It does, however, 
lie on the SODDY 
LINE.

CENTERO,CENTROIDG,NINE-POINT 
CENTERF,OR-

CO- 
incide 
with 
I. 
The 
incenter 
and EXCENTERS of a TRIANGLE 
are an 
ORTHOCENTRIC 
SYSTEM. The POWER of the incenter 
with respect 
to the CIRCUMCIRCLE is 
(Johnson 
1929, 
p. 190). 
If the incenters 
of the TRIAN- 
GLES AAlHzH3, 
AAaHaAl, 
and AAaHlH2 
are X1, X2, 
and X3, then 
X2X3 
is equal 
and parallel 
to 
1213, 
where 
Hi are the FEET of the ALTITUDES and Ii 
are the in- 
centers 
of the TRIANGLES. 
Furthermore, 
X1, 
X2, 
X3, 
are the reflections 
of I with 
respect 
to the sides of the 
TRIANGLE AIJ2X3 
(Johnson 
1929, pa 193).

If four 
points 
are on a CIRCLE 
(i.e., 
they 
are CON- 
CYCLIC), 
the 
incenters 
of the 
four TRIANGLES form 
a 
RECTANGLE whose 
sides are parallel 
to the 
lines 
con- 
necting 
the middle 
points 
of opposite 
arcs. Furthermore, 
the connectors 
pass through 
the center 
of the RECTAN- 
GLE (Fuhrmann 
1890, 
p* 50; Johnson 
1929, 
pp. 
254-

More 
generally, 
the 16 incenters 
and excenters 
of 
the TRIANGLES whose VERTICES are four 
points 
on a 
CIRCLE, 
are the intersections 
of two sets of four PARAL- 
LEL lines which 
are mutually 
PERPENDICULAR 
(Johnson

Increasing 
Function 
A function 
f( LC increases 
on an INTERVAL I if f(b) 
> 
) 
f(a) 
for all b > a, where a, b f 1. Conversely, 
a function 
f(z) 
decreases 
on an INTERVAL 1 if f(b) 
< f(a) 
for all 
b > a with 
a,b E I. 
If the DERIVATIVE f'(z) 
of a CONTINUOUS FUNCTION 
f(z) 
satisfies 
f’(z) 
> 0 on an OPEN 
INTERVAL (u,b), 
then 
f(z) 
is increasing 
on (a, b). 
However, 
a function 
may increase 
on an interval 
without 
having 
a derivative 
defined 
at all points. 
For example, 
the 
function 
xl/3 
is increasing 
everywhere, 
including 
the 
origin 
x = 
0, 
despite 
the fact that 
the DERIVATIVE is not defined 
at 
that 
point.

< 0 for 
n 2 2, then 
a is DECREASING for n 2 2. If u,+l/a,

Independence 
Complement 
Theorem 
If sets E and F are INDEPENDENT, then 
so are E and 
F’, 
where 
F’ is the complement 
of F (i.e., the set of all 
possible 
outcomes 
not 
contained 
in F). 
Let 
U denote 
“or” 
and n denote 
“and.” 
Then 
P(E) 
= P(EF 
u EF’) 
(1) 
= P(EF) 
+ P(EF’) 
- P(EF 
n EF’), 
(2) 
where 
AB 
is an abbreviation 
for A n B. 
But 
E and 
F 
are independent, 
so 
P(EF) 
= P(E)P(F). 
(3) 
Also, 
since F and F’ are complements, 
they 
contain 
no 
common 
elements, 
which 
means 
that 
P(EF 
n EF’) 
= 0 
(4) 
for any E. Plugging 
(4) and (3) into 
(2) then 
gives 
P(E) 
= P(E)P(F) 
+ P(EF’). 
(5 
Rearranging, 
P(EF’) 
= P(E)[l 
- P(F)] 
= P(E)P(F’),

Inequality 
A mathematical 
statement 
that 
one quantity 
is greater 
than 
or less than 
another. 
“a is less than 
b” is denoted 
a < b, and 
“a is greater 
than 
b” is denoted 
a > b. “a 
is less than 
ur equal 
to b” is denoted 
a < b, and 
“u 
is greater 
than 
or equal 
to b” is denoted 
a 2 b. 
The 
symbols 
a << b and a >> b are used to denote 
‘5~ is much 
less than 
b” and “a is much 
greater 
than 
b,” respectively. 
Solutions 
to the inequality 
IX - al < b consist 
of the set 
{ x : -b<x- 
a < b}, or equivalently 
{z : a - b < x < 
a + b}. Solutions 
to the inequality 
Ix - al > b consist 
of 
the set {x : x - a > b} U {x : 2 - a < -b}. 
If a and b 
are both 
POSITIVE or both 
NEGATIVE and a < b, then 
l/a 
> l/b.

Infinitesimal 
Rotation 
Infinitesimal 
A quantity 
which 
yields 
0 after the application 
of some 
LIMITING 
process. 
The 
understanding 
of infinitesimals 
was a major 
roadblock 
to the acceptance 
of CALCULUS 
and its placement 
on a firm 
mathematical 
foundation.

Infinitesimal 
Matrix 
Change 
Let 
B, A, and e be square 
matrices 
with 
e small, 
and 
define 
B = A(1 + e), 
(1) 
where 
1 is the 
IDENTITY 
MATRIX. 
Then 
the inverse 
of 
I3 is approximately 
B -’ = (I - e)A? 
This 
can be seen by multiplying 
(2) 
BB -’ = (A + Ae)(A-1 
- eA-‘) 
z AA--l - AeA-1 + AeA-1 - Ae2AB1 
= I - Ae2Am1 z I. 
(3) 
Note 
that 
if we instead 
let B’ E A + e, and look 
for an 
inverse 
of the form 
B’-’ 
= A-’ 
+ C, we obtain 
B’B ‘-’ = (A + e)(A-’ 
+ C) = AAD1 + AC + eA-’ + eC 
= I + AC + e(C + A-‘) 
E I. 
(4 
In order 
to eliminate 
the e term, 
we require 
C = -A? 
However, 
then AC = -I, 
so BB-l 
= 0 so there 
can be 
no inverse 
of this form. 
The 
exact 
inverse 
of B can be found 
as follows. 
6 = A(l + e ) = A(1 + A-‘e), 
(5) 
so 
6-l 
= [A (I + A-‘e)]? 
(6) 
Using 
a general 
MATRIX 
INVERSE 
identity 
then 
gives 
6 -’ 
= (I + A-le)-lA-l. 
(7) 
Infinitesimal 
Rotation 
An infinitesimal 
transformation 
of a VECTOR 
r is given 
bY 
r’ = (I + e)r, 
(1) 
where the 
MATRIX 
e is infinitesimal 
and 
1 is the IDEN- 
TITY 
MATRIX. 
(Note 
that 
the infinitesimal 
transforma- 
tion 
may not correspond 
to an inversion, 
since inversion 

hfinitesimal 
Rotation 
is a discontinuous 
process.) 
The C~MMUTATTVITY 
of in- 
finitesimal 
transformations 
el and e2 is established 
by 
the equivalence 
of 
(I + el)(l+ 
e2) = 12+eJ+le2+ele2 
4+el+e2 
(2) 
(I +ea)(l+ 
el) = 12+e21+lel+e2el 
==: I+ez+el. 
(3) 
Now let 
Ad+e. 
(4) 
The 
inverse 
A-’ 
is then 
I - e, since 
AA-l 
= (I + e)(l - e) = I2 - e2 ==: I. 
(5) 
Since we are defining 
our infinitesimal 
transformation 
to 
be a rotation, 
ORTHOGONALITY 
of ROTATION MATRI- 
CES requires 
that 
AT = A-l, 
(6 
but 
A -1 =I-e 
(7 
(I + e)T = IT + eT = I + eT, 
(8 
SO e = -eT 
and the infinitesimal 
rotation 
is ANTISYM 
METRIC. It must 
therefore 
have a MATRIX 
of the form

a, b, and c are 
the side lengths, 
s is the SEMIPERIMETER, 
and R is the 
CIRCUMRADIUS 
(Johnson

Equation 
(1) can be derived 
easily 
using TRILINEAR 
CO- 
ORDINATES. 
Since the INCENTER 
is equally 
spaced from 
all three 
sides, its trilinear 
coordinates 
are l:l:l, 
and its 
exact 
trilinear 
coordinates 
are T : T : T. The 
ratio 
k of 
the exact 
trilinears 
to the 
homogeneous 
coordinates 
is 
given

As shown in RIGHT

the inradius

of integral 
side lengths 
x, y, and 
z is also 
integral, 
and is given 
by

that, 
if we are igno-

can occur and therefore 
have 
no reason 
to believe 
that

preferen-

it will occur

is 
said to be integrable.

DIFFERENTIABLE, 
INTEGRAL, INTEGRATION 
Integral 
An integral 
is a mathematical 
object 
which 
can be in- 
terpreted 
as an AREA 
or a generalization 
of AREA. 
Inte- 
grals, 
together 
with 
DERIVATIVES, 
are the fundamental 
objects 
of CALCULUS. 
Other 
words for integral 
include 
ANTIDERIVATIVE 
and 
PRIMITIVE. 
The 
RIEMANN 
IN- 
TEGRAL 
is the simplest 
integral 
definition 
and the only 
one usually 
encountered 
in elementary 
CALCULUS. 
The 
RIEMANN 
INTEGRAL 
of the function 
f(x) 
over x from 
a 
to b is written 
s 
b 
f (4 
dx* 
(1) 
a 
Every 
definition 
of an integral 
is based 
on a particu- 
lar MEASURE. 
For instance, 
the RIEMANN 
INTEGRAL 
is 
based on JORDAN 
MEASURE, 
and the LEBESGUE 
INTE- 
GRAL is based on LEBESGUE 
MEASURE. 
The process 
of 
computing 
an integral 
is called 
INTEGRATION 
(a more 
archaic 
term 
for INTEGRATION 
is QUADRATURE), 
and 
the approximate 
computation 
of an integral 
is termed 
NUMERICAL 
INTEGRATION. 
There 
are two classes of (Riemann) 
integrals: 
DEFINITE 
INTEGRALS 
I 
b 
f (4 
dx, 
(2) 
a 
Integral 
INTEGRALS, 
since if F is the INDEFINITE 
INTEGRAL 
for 
f (4, then

f(x) 
dx = F(b) 
- F(a).

Chebyshev

if U, 
V, and W are RATIONAL

then 
SIMPSON'S 
RULE, 
respectively. 
The 
5-point 
formula 
is 
called 
BODE'S 
RULE. 
A generalization 
of the 
TRAPE- 
ZOIDAL 
RULE 
is ROMBERG 
INTEGRATION, 
which 
can 
yield 
accurate 
results 
for many 
fewer function 
evalua- 
tions. 
If the 
analytic 
form 
of a function 
is known 
(instead 
of its values 
merely 
being 
tabulated 
at a fixed 
number 
of points), 
the best numerical 
method 
of integration 
is 
called 
GAUSSIAN 
QUADRATURE. 
By picking 
the optimal 
ABSCISSAS 
at which 
to compute 
the function, 
Gaussian 
quadrature 
produces 
the most 
accurate 
approximations 
possible. 
However, 
given 
the speed 
of modern 
comput- 
ers, the additional 
complication 
of the GAUSSIAN 
QUAD- 
RATURE 
formalism 
often 
makes 
it 
less desirable 
than 
the 
brute-force 
method 
of simply 
repeatedly 
calculat- 
ing twice as many 
points 
on a regular 
grid until 
conver- 
gence is obtained. 
An excellent 
reference 
for GAUSSIAN 
QUADRATURE 
is Hildebrand 
(1956).

If the limits

an integral

is called 
a

equation. 
If one limit 
is variable, 
it 
is called 
a Volterra

If the unknown 
function 
is only 
under 
the integral 
sign, 
the equation 
is 
said to be of the 
“first

If the function 
is both 
inside 
and outside, 
the equation 
is called 
of the “second

if 
The

Every 
row of A is an increasing 
sequence, 
Every 
column

If an array

then 
it is a DIS- 
PERSION. If an array 
A =

is an interspersion, 
then 
the sequence 
{zn} 
given

Interval 
A collection

on a LINE 
SEGMENT. 
If the end- 
points 
a and b are FINITE 
and are included, 
the interval 
is called 
CLOSED and is denoted 
[a, b]. If one of the end- 
points 
is 4~00, then 
the interval 
still 
contains 
all of its

If the endpoints 
are not included, 
the interval 
is called 
OPEN 
and 
denoted 
(a, b). 
If one endpoint 
is 
included 
but not the other, 
the interval 
is denoted

Invariant 
A quantity 
which 
remains 
unchanged 
under 
certain 
classes of transformations. 
Invariants 
are extremely 
use- 
ful for classifying 
mathematical 
objects 
because 
they 
usually 
reflect 
intrinsic 
properties 
of the object 
of study.

Inversion 
is the process 
of transforming 
points 
to their 
INVERSE 
POINTS. 
This 
sort of inversion 
was first 
sys- 
tematically 
investigated 
by Jakob 
Steiner.

points

RADIUS 
k if PT 
and PS are line segments 
sym- 
metric 
about 
OP 
and tangent 
to the 
CIRCLE, 
and Q is 
the intersection 
of OP 
and 
ST. 
The 
curve 
to which 
a 
given 
curve 
is transformed 
under 
inversion 
is called 
its 
INVERSE 
CURVE. 
Note 
that 
a point 
on the 
CIRCUMFERENCE 
of the 
IN- 
VERSION 
CIRCLE 
is its own inverse 
point.

Inversive 
Distance 
The 
inversive 
distance 
is the NATURAL 
LOGARITHM 
of 
the ratio 
of two concentric 
circles 
into 
which 
the given 
circles 
can be inverted. 
Let 
c be the distance 
between 
the centers 
of two nonintersecting 
CIRCLES 
of RADII 
a 
and b < a. Then 
the inversive 
distance 
is 
(Coxeter 
and Greitzer 
1967). 
The 
inversive 
distance 
between 
the SODDY 
CIRCLES 
is 
given by

Extend 
the string

Number 
(ISBN) 
is a 
lo-digit 
CODE which is used to identify 
a book 
uniquely. 
The first four digits 
specify 
the publisher, 
the next 
five 
digits 
the book, 
and the last 
digit 
&o 
is a check 
digit 
which 
may 
be in the range 
O-9 or X (where 
X equals 
10). The 
check digit 
is computed 
from 
the equation 
1Odr + 9d2 + 8d3 + . . . + 2dg + dlo 
E 0 (mod 
11). 
For example, 
the number 
for this book 
is o-8493-9640-9, 
and

result 
is the end result 
of the massive 
and 
beautiful 
theory 
of COMPLEX

the

so-called 
‘CJ~~~~~~~~~~."

(Sloane’s 
AOOO521) 
are POSITIVE INTEGERS (Rankin 
1977). 
Let d be a POSITIVE SQUAREFREE INTEGER, 
and define 
tr 
iJ2 
for d z 1 or 2 (mod 
4) 
i(l 
+i&) 
for d E 3 (mod

for d s 1 or 2 (mod

for d E 3 (mod 
4). 
It then 
turns 
out that 
j(q) 
is an ALGEBRAIC INTEGER 
of degree 
h(A), 
where h(-d) 
is the CLASS NUMBER of 
the DISCRIMINANT 
-dof 
the QUADRATIC FIELDQ(~~) 
(Silverman 
1986). 
The 
first 
term 
in the LAURENT SE- 
RIES is then 
q-l 
= 
e-2rfi 
or -Cam, 
and 
all 
the 
later 
terms 
are POWERS of q-l, 
which 
are small 
num- 
bers. 
The 
larger 
n, the 
faster 
the series converges. 
If 
h(-d) 
= l,then 
j(q) 
is a ALGEBRAIC INTEGER ofde- 
gree 
1, i.e., 
just 
a plain 
INTEGER. 
Furthermore, 
the 
INTEGER is a perfect 
CUBE. 
The 
numbers 
whose LAURENT SERIES give INTEGERS 
are those with CLASS NUMBER 1. But these are precisely 
the HEEGNER NUMBERS -1, 
-2, 
-3, 
-7, 
-11, 
-19, 
-43, 
-67, 
-163. 
The 
greater 
(in ABSOLUTE VALUE) 
the HEEGNER NUMBER d, the closer to an INTEGER is 
the expression 
exG, 
since 
the 
initial 
term 
in j(q) 
is 
the largest 
and subsequent 
terms 
are the smallest. 
The 
best approximations 
with 
h(-d) 
= 1 are therefore 
e 7r&i3 = 9603 + 744 - 2.2 x 1O-4

since it is 
also the

The 
ALMOST IN-

the

is known 
as 
the RAMANUJAN CONSTANT. 
e”Jiz,

These 
correspond 
to binary

with

-88,

and 
-232, 
all 
of which 
have 
CLASS NUMBER two 
and 
were noted 
by Ramanujan 
(Berndt 
1994). 
It turns 
out that 
the j-function 
also is important 
in the 
CLASSIFICATION THEOREM for finite 
simple 
groups, 
and 
that 
the factors 
of the orders 
of the SPORADIC GROUPS, 
including 
the celebrated 
MONSTER GROUP, are also re- 
lated.

Triangulation 
Theorem 
Let a convex 
CYCLIC POLYGON be TRIANGULATED 
in 
any manner, 
and draw the INCIRCLE to each TRIANGLE 
so constructed. 
Then 
the sum of the INRADII is a con- 
stant 
independent 
of the TRIANGULATION 
chosen. 
This 
theorem 
can be proved 
using CARNOT'S THEOREM. It is 
also true 
that 
if the sum of INRADTI does not depend 
on 
the TRIANGULATION 
of a POLYGON, then the POLYGON 
is CYCLIC.

Jeep 
Problem 
Maximize 
the 
distance 
a jeep 
can penetrate 
into 
the 
desert using 
a given quantity 
of fuel. 
The jeep is allowed 
to go forward, 
unload 
some 
fuel, and then 
return 
to its 
base using 
the fuel remaining 
in its tank. 
At its base, 
it may 
refuel 
and set out again. 
When 
it reaches fuel it 
has previously 
stored, 
it may 
then 
use it to partially 
fill 
its tank. 
This 
problem 
is also called 
the EXPLORATION 
PROBLEM (Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
Given 
n + f (with 
0 5 
f 
< 
1) drums 
of fuel 
at the 
edge 
of the 
desert 
and 
a jeep 
capable 
of holding 
one 
drum 
(and 
storing 
fuel 
in containers 
along 
the 
way), 
the maximum 
one-way 
distance 
which 
can be traveled 
(assuming 
the jeep travels 
one unit 
of distance 
per drum 
of fuel expended) 
is 
f 
- - a+ 
37+2ln2+7h($ 
+n>], 
where 
7 is the 
EULER-MASCHERONI 
CONSTANT and 
G&Z) the POLYGAMMA FUNCTION. 
For example, 
the farthest 
a jeep 
with 
n = 1 drum 
can 
travel 
is obviously 
1 unit. 
However, 
with 
n = 2 drums 
of 
gas, the maximum 
distance 
is achieved 
by filling 
up the 
jeep’s 
tank 
with 
the first, drum, 
traveling 
l/3 
of a unit, 
storing 
l/3 
of a drum 
of fuel there, 
and then 
returning 
to base with 
the remaining 
l/3 
of a tank. 
At the base, 
the tank 
is filled 
with 
the second 
drum. 
The jeep 
then 
travels 
l/3 
of a unit 
(expending 
l/3 
of a drum 
of fuel), 
refills 
the tank 
using 
the 
l/3 
of a drum 
of fuel stored 
there, 
and continues 
an additional 
1 unit 
of distance 
on 
a full tank, 
giving 
a total 
distance 
of 4/3. 
The solutions 
for 
n = 
1, 2, . . . drums 
are 1, 4/3, 
23/15, 
176/105, 
563/315, 
. l . , which 
can also be written 
as a(n)/b(n), 
where 
a(n)=

regular 
PLATONIC SOLIDS, the 
~~SEMIREGULAR~' AR- 
CHIMEDEAN SOLIDS, and 
the 
two 
infinite 
families 
of 
PRISMS and ANTIPRISMS). 
There 
are 28 simple

and 
Zalgaller 
(1969) 
proved 
that 
there 
exist exactly

The jinc

The function

Jones 
Polynomial 
The 
second KNOT POLYNOMIAL discovered. 
Unlike 
the 
first-discovered 
ALEXANDER POLYNOMIAL, the 
Jones 
polynomial 
can sometimes 
distinguish 
handedness 
(as 
can its 
more 
powerful 
generalization, 
the 
HOMFLY 
POLYNOMIAL) 
l Jones polynomials 
are LAURENT POLY- 
NOMIALS in t assigned 
to an R3 KNOT. The 
Jones poly- 
nomials 
are denoted 
Vr;(t) 
for LINKS, V&t) 
for KNOTS, 
and normalized 
so that

Let K*

the MIRRUR IMAGE of a KNOT K.

example, 
the

(2) 
If a LINK has an 00x> number 
of components, 
then 
VL 
is a LAURENT POLYNOMIAL over the INTEGERS; if the 
number 
of components 
is EVEN, VL(~) 
is t1i2 times 
a 
LAURENT POLYNOMIAL.

A table 
of the W poly- 
nomials 
is given 
by Jones (1985) 
for knots 
of up to eight 
crossings, 
and 
by Jones 
(1987) 
for knots 
of up to 
10 
crossings. 
(Note 
that 
in these 
papers, 
an additional 
polynomial 
which 
Jones 
calls 
V is also tabulated, 
but 
it is not the conventionally 
defined 
Jones polynomial.) 
Jones polynomials 
were subsequently 
generalized 
to the 
two-variable 
HOMFLY 
POLYNOMIALS, the relationship 
being 
V(t) 
= P(a 
= t,x 
= c2 
- t-lj2) 
(14) 
V(t) 
= P(& = it,m 
= i(H2 
- t’l”)). 
(15) 
They 
are relatedtothe 
KAUFFMAN POLYNOMIAL F by 
V(t) 
= F(-t-3’4, 
t-1’4 
+ t1’4). 
(16) 
Jones (1987) 
gives a table 
of BRAID WORDS and W poly- 
nomials 
for knots 
up to 10 crossings. 
Jones 
polynomi- 
als for KNOTS up to nine 
crossings 
are given 
in Adams 
(1994) 
and 
for oriented 
links 
up to nine 
crossings 
by 
Doll 
and 
Hoste 
(1991). 
All PRIME KNOTS with 
10 or 
fewer crossings 
have 
distinct 
Jones 
polynomials.

not known 
if there 
is a nontrivial 
knot 
with 
Jones poly- 
nomial

Jones Polynomial 
Jordan-Hilder 
Theorem 
Let 
k be one component 
of an oriented 
LINK 
1;. Now 
form 
a new oriented 
LINK 
L* by reversing 
the orienta- 
tion 
of k. Then 
vL* 
= K3v(L), 
where 
V is the Jones 
polynomial 
and 
X is the 
LINKING 
NUMBER 
of /C and L - k. 
No such result 
is known 
for 
HOMFLY 
POLYNOMIALS 
(Lickorish 
and Millett 
1988). 
Birman 
and 
Lin 
(1993) 
showed 
that 
substituting 
the 
POWER 
SERIES for e2 as the variable 
in the Jones poly- 
nomial 
yields 
a POWER 
SERIES 
whose 
COEFFICIENTS 
are VASSILIEV 
POLYNOMIALS. 
Let 
L be an oriented 
connected 
LINK 
projection 
of 
n 
crossings, 
then 
n > span V(L), 
(18) 
with 
equality 
if L is ALTERNATING and has no REMOV- 
ABLE CROSSING (Lickorish 
and Millett 
1988). 
There 
exist 
distinct 
KNOTS 
with 
the same Jones ply- 
nomial. 
Examples 
include 
(05001, l&32), 
(08008, 10129), 
(08 016, 104, 
(10025, 
10056), 
(10022,

(10071,

10086), 
(10081, 
10109), 
and 
(lo1377 
10~~~) (Jones 
1987). 
Incidentally, 
the first four of these 
also have the same HOMFLY 
POLYNOMIAL. 
Witten 
(1989) 
g ave a heuristic 
definition 
in terms 
of 
a topological 
quantum 
field 
theory, 
and 
Sawin 
(1996) 
showed 
that 
the “quantum 
group” 
U&22) 
gives rise to 
the Jones 
polynomial.

Given 
a group 
of n men arranged 
in a CIRCLE 
under 
the 
edict 
that 
every mth 
man 
will be executed 
going 
around 
the 
CIRCLE 
until 
only 
one remains, 
find 
the 
position 
L(n, 
m) in which you should 
stand in order to be the last 
survivor 
(Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
The original 
problem 
consisted 
of a CIRCLE 
of 41 men 
with 
every 
third 
man 
killed 
(n = 41, m = 3). In order 
for the lives of the last 
two men to be spared, 
they 
must 
be placed 
at positions 
31 (last) 
and 16 (second-to-last)* 
The following 
array gives the original

Another 
version 
of the problem 
considers 
a CIRCLE 
of 
two groups 
(say, “A” 
and “B”) 
of 15 men each, with ev- 
ery ninth 
man 
cast overboard. 
To save all the members 
of the 
“A” 
group, 
the men 
must 
be placed 
at positions 
1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 25, 28, 29, giving 
the ordering 
AAAABBBBBAABAAABABBAABBBABBAAB

can 
be 
remembered 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
MNEMICIC 
‘Worn

aid and art, never will fame 
depart.” 
Consider 
the vowels only, 
assign 
a = 1, e = 2, 
i = 3,0 
= 4, u = 5, and alternately 
add a number 
of 
letters 
corresponding 
to a vowel value, 
so 4A (o), 5B (u), 
2A (e), etc. (Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
If every tenth 
man 
is instead 
thrown 
overboard, 
the men 
from 
the “A” 
group 
must 
be placed 
in positions 
1, 2, 4, 
5, 6, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 25, 28, 29, giving

Set 
Let R(z) 
be a rational 
function 
where z E C*, 
c* 
is the RIEMANN 
SPHERE 
~U{m}, 
ani 
P and Q are POLYNOMIALS 
without 
common

The 
“filled-in” 
Julia 
set JR is the set of points 
z which 
do not approach 
infinity 
after R(x) 
is repeatedly 
applied. 
The 
true 
Julia 
set is the 
boundary 
of the filled-in 
set 
(the 
set of “exceptional 
points”). 
There 
are two types 
of Julia 
sets: connected 
sets and CANTOR 
SETS. 
For a Julia 
set& 
with c < 
1, the CAPACITY 
DIMENSION 
is 
d 
I I 
c2 
capacity 
= 
1 + 
4 
+ 
O(lc13). 
(2) 
For small 
c, Jc is also a JORDAN 
CURVE, 
although 
its 
points 
are not 
COMPUTABLE. 
Quadratic 
Julia 
sets are 
generated 
by the 
quadratic 
mapping 
ha+1 
= &a2 + C 
(3) 
for fixed 
c. 
The 
special 
case c = 
-0.123

is 
called 
DOUADY'S 
RABBIT 
FRACTAL, 
c = -0.75 
is called 
the 
SAN MARCO 
FRACTAL, 
and 
c = -0.391 
- 0.587i 
is the SIEGEL DISK 
FRACTAL. 
For every 
c, this 
trans- 
formation 
generates 
a FRACTAL. 
It is a CONFORMAL 
TRANSFORMATION, 
so angles 
are preserved. 
Let 
J be 
the JULIA SET, then 
x’ + 
x leaves 
J invariant. 
If a 
point 
P is on J, then 
all its iterations 
are on J. 
The 
transformation 
has a two-valued 
inverse. 
If b = 0 and y 
is started 
at 0, then the map 
is equivalent 
to the LOGIS- 
TIC MAP. 
The 
set of all points 
for which 
J is connected 
is known 
as the MANDELBROT

k-Theory 
A branch

which

together 
ideas 
from 
algebraic 
geometry, 
LINEAR ALGEBRA, and NUM- 
BER THEORY. In general, 
there 
are two main 
types 
of 
K-theory: 
topological 
and algebraic. 
Topological 
k-theory 
is the “true” 
k-theory 
in the sense 
that 
it came 
first. 
Topological 
Ic-.theory 
has to do with 
VECTOR BUNDLES over TOPOLOGICAL 
SPACES. Ele-

of a k-theory 
are STABLE EQUIVALENCE classes 
of VECTORBUNDLES 
overa 
TOPOLOGICAL

of STABLY 
EQUIVALENT bundles 
by defining 
ADDITION through 
the

TEN-

real topological 
k-theory 
of a space.” 
“The 
reduced 
k-theory 
of a space” 
refers to the 
same 
construction, 
but 
instead 
of REAL VECTOR BUNDLES, 
COMPLEX VECTOR BUNDLES are used. 
Topological 
k- 
theory 
is significant 
because 
it forms 
a generalized 
CO- 
HOMOLOGY 
theory, 
and it leads to a solution 
to the vec- 
tor 
fields 
on spheres 
problem, 
as well as to an under- 
standing 
of the J-homeomorphism 
of HOMOTOPY THE- 
ORY. 
Algebraic 
k-theory 
is somewhat 
more 
involved. 
Swan 
(1962) 
noticed 
that 
there 
is a correspondence 
between 
the CATEGORY of suitably 
nice TOPOLOGICAL SPACES 
(something 
like 
regular 
HAUSDORFF SPACES) and 
C*- 
ALGEBRAS. The 
idea is to associate 
to every SPACE the 
C*-ALGEBRA 
of CONTINUOUS MAPS from 
that 
SPACE 
to the REALS. 
A VECTOR BUNDLE over 
a SPACE has sections, 
and 
these sections 
can be multiplied 
by CONTINUOUS FUNC- 
TIONS to the REALS. 
Under 
Swan’s 
correspondence, 
VECTOR BUNDLES correspond 
to modules 
over the C*- 
ALGEBRA of CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS, the MODULES 
being 
the modules 
of sections 
of the VECTOR BUNDLE. 
This 
study 
of MODULES over C*-ALGEBRA 
is the start- 
ing point 
of algebraic 
k-theory. 
The QUILLEN-LICHTENBAUM 
CONJECTURE connectsal- 
gebraic 
k-theory 
to &ale 
cohomology.

k-Tuple 
Conjecture 
The 
first 
of the 
HARDY-LITTLEWOOD 
CONJECTURES. 
The k-tuple 
conjecture 
states 
that 
the asymptotic 
num- 
ber 
of PRIME CONSTELLATIONS can be computed 
ex- 
plicit 1 y. 
In 
particular, 
unless 
there 
is a trivial 
divisi- 
bility 
condition 
that 
stops p, JJ + al, 
. . . , p + ak from 
consisting 
of PRIMES infinitely 
often, 
then 
such PRIME 
CONSTELLATIONS will 
occur 
with 
an asymptotic 
den- 
sity 
which 
is computable 
in terms 
of al, 
. . . , ak. 
Let 
0 <ml 
< rnz < . . . < rnk, 
then 
the k-tuple 
conjecture 
predicts 
that 
the number 
of PRIMES p 5 2 such that 
p+2ml,p+2mz, 
. . ..p+2mk 
areallP~I~~is 
s 
X 
dt 
P(x;ml,m2,.*.,mk)-C(ml,m2,...,mk) 
- 
2 In"+%! 
(1) 
where 
the product 
is over ODD PRIMES q, and 
denotes 
the 
number 
of distinct 
residues 
of 0, ml, 
. . . , 
??%k (mod 
q) (Halberstam 
and Richert 
1974, 
Odlyzko). 
If k = 1, then 
this 
becomes 
q(q-2) 
4-l 
c(m)=211,,q,m,_,* 
rI 
9 
(4) 
This 
conjecture 
is generally 
believed 
to be true, 
but has 
not 
been proven 
(Odlyzko 
et al. ). The 
following 
spe- 
cial 
case of the conjecture 
is sometimes 
known 
as the 
PRIME PATTERNS CONJECTURE. 
Let 
S be a FINITE 
set of INTEGERS. Then 
it is conjectured 
that 
there 
ex- 
ist infinitely 
many 
k for which 
{k + s : s f S} are all 
PRIME IFF S does not include 
all the RESIDUES of any 
PRIME. 
The 
TWIN PRIME CONJECTURE is a special 
case of the prime 
patterns 
conjecture 
with 
S = {0,2}. 
This 
conjecture 
also implies 
that 
there 
are arbitrarily 
long ARITHMETIC 
PROGRESSIONS of PRIMES.

Problem 
What 
is the plane 
figure 
of least 
AREA 
in which 
a line 
segment 
of width 
1 can be freely 
rotated 
(where transla- 
tion 
of the segment 
is also allowed)? 
Besicovitch 
(1928) 
proved 
that 
there 
is no MINIMUM 
AREA. 
This 
can be 
seen by rotating 
a line segment 
inside 
a DELTOID, 
star- 
shaped 
5-oid, 
star-shaped 
7-oid, 
etc. 
When 
the figure 
is restricted 
to be convex, 
Cunningham 
and Schoenberg 
(1965) 
found 
there 
is still 
no minimum 
AREA. 
How- 
ever,

smallest 
simple

domain 
in which 
one 
can put

Kaplan-Yorke 
Conjecture 
There 
are several 
versions 
of the 
Kaplan-Yorke 
con- 
jecture, 
with 
many 
of the higher 
dimensional 
ones re- 
maining 
unsettled. 
The 
original 
Kaplan-Yorke 
conjec- 
ture 
(Kaplan 
and 
Yorke 
1979) 
proposed 
that, 
for a 
two-dimensional 
mapping, 
the CAPACITY 
DIMENSION 
D 
equals 
the KAPLAN-Y• 
RKE 
DIMENSION 
DKY, 
where 
g1 and 
02 are the 
LYAPUNOV 
CHARACTERISTIC 
EXPONENTS. 
This 
was subsequently 
proven 
to be true in 
1982. 
A later 
conjecture 
held 
that 
the KAPLAN-Y• 
RKE 
DIMENSION 
is generically 
equal 
to a probabilistic 
dimen- 
sion which 
appears 
to be identical 
to the INFORMATION 
DIMENSION 
(Frederickson 
et al. 1983). 
This 
conjecture 
is partially 
verified 
by Ledrappier 
(1981). 
For invertible 
2-D maps, 
v = u = D, where 
v is the 
CORRELATION 
EXPONENT, o is the INFORMATION DIMENSION, 
and D 
is the 
CAPACITY 
DIMENSION 
(Young 
1984).

Kaprekar 
Routine 
A routine 
discovered 
in 1949 by D. R. Kaprekar 
for 4- 
digit 
numbers, 
but 
which 
can be generalized 
to k-digit 
numbers. 
To apply 
the Kaprekar 
routine 
to a numbkr 
n, arrange 
the digits 
in descending 
(n’) 
and ascending 
(n”) 
order. 
Now compute 
K(n) 
= n’ - n” and iterate. 
The algorithm 
reaches 0 (a degenerate 
case), a constant,

Karatsuba 
Multiplication 
It 
is possible 
to perform 
MULTIPLICATION 
of LARGE 
NUMBERS 
in (many) 
fewer operations 
than 
the 
usual 
brute-force 
technique 
of “long 
multiplication.” 
As dis- 
covered 
by Karatsuba 
and Ofman 
(1962), 
MULTIPLICA- 
TION 
of two n-DIGIT 
numbers 
can be done with 
a BIT 
COMPLEXITY 
of less than 
n2 using 
identities 
of the form 
(a + b ’ 10n)(c 
+ d 
l lon> 
=ac+[(a+b)(C+d)-UC-bd]lOn+bd~lOzn.

Proceeding 
recursively 
then 
gives 
BIT 
COMPLEXITY 
O(dg3), 
where 
lg3 
= 
1.58.. 
. < 
2 (Borwein 
ef al. 
1989). 
The 
best 
known 
bound 
is O(nlg 
n lglg 
n) steps 
for n > 
1 (Schijnhage 
and Strassen 
1971, Knuth 
1981). 
However, 
this ALGORITHM 
is difficult 
to implement, 
but 
aprocedurebasedonthe 
FAST FOURIERTRANSFORM 
is 
straightforward 
to implement 
and gives BIT 
COMPLEX- 
ITY O( (lg n> 2%) 
(Brigham 
1974, 
Borodin 
and 
Munro 
1975, Knuth

As a concrete

is a SET of SUBSETS 
in which 
each pair 
of adjacent 
elements 
is found 
separated, 
each in one of 
two disjoint 
subsets. 
For example, 
the 26 letters

can be separated

and the Karatsuba 
algorithm 
can be applied 
to Nl 
and 
& 
in this 
form. 
Therefore, 
the Karatsuba 
algorithm 
is not restricted 
to multiplying 
two-digit 
numbers, 
but 
more 
generally 
expresses 
the multiplication 
of two num- 
bers in terms 
of multiplications 
of numbers 
of half 
the 
size. The asymptotic 
speed the algorithm 
obtains 
by re- 
cursive 
application 
to the smaller 
required 
subproducts 
is 6(nlg3) 
(Knuth 
1981). 
The problem 
was posed 
by Katona 
( 
C. Mao-Cheng 
in 1982, 
1973) and solved by 
When 
this technique 
is recursively 
applied 
to multidigit 
numbers, 
a point 
is reached 
in the recursion 
when the 
overhead 
of additions 
and 
subtractions 
makes 
it more 
efficient 
to use the usual 
S(n2) 
MULTIPLICATION 
algo- 
rithm 
to evaluate 
the partial 
products. 
The 
most 
effi- 
cient 
overall 
method 
therefore 
relies 
on a combination 
of Karatsuba 
and conventional 
multiplication.

then 
N 
itself 
occurs 
as a term 
in the 
sequence. 
For example, 
197 is a Keith 
number 
since 
it generates 
the sequence 
1, 9, 7, 17, 33, 57, 107, 197, 
. . . (Keith). 
Keith 
numbers 
are also called 
REPFIGIT 
NUMBERS. 
There 
is no known 
general 
technique 
for finding 
Keith 
numbers 
except 
by exhaustive 
search. 
Keith 
numbers 
are much 
rarer 
than 
the 
PRIMES, 
with 
only 
52 Keith 
numbers 
with 
< 15 digits: 
14, 19, 28, 47, 61, 75, 197, 
742, 
1104, 
1537, 
2208, 
2580, 
3684, 
4788, 
7385, 
7647, 
7909, . . . (Sloane’s 
A007629). 
In addition, 
three 
15-digit 
Keith 
numbers 
are known 
(Keith 
1994). 
It is not known 
if there 
are an INFINITE 
number 
of Keith 
numbers.

Kepler 
Conjecture 
In 
1611, 
Kepler 
proposed 
that 
close packing 
(cubic 
or 
hexagonal) 
is the 
densest 
possible 
SPHERE 
PACKING 
(has the greatest 
q), and this 
assertion 
is known 
as the 
Kepler 
conjecture. 
Finding 
the densest 
(not necessarily 
periodic) 
packing 
of spheres 
is known 
as the 
KEPLER 
PROBLEM. 
A putative 
proof 
of the Kepler 
conjecture 
was put 
for- 
ward by W.-Y. 
Hsiang 
(Hsiang 
1992, 
Cipra 
1993), 
but 
was subsequently 
determined 
to be flawed 
(Conway 
et 
al. 1994, Hales 
1994). 
According 
to J. H. Conway, 
no- 
body 
who has read Hsiang’s 
proof 
has any doubts 
about 
its validity: 
it is nonsense.

Kepler-Poinsot 
Solid 
The Kepler-Poinsot 
solids are the four regular 
CONCAVE 
POLYHEDRA 
with 
intersecting 
facial 
planes. 
They 
are 
composed 
of regular 
CONCAVE 
POLYGONS 
and were un- 
known 
to the ancients. 
Kepler 
discovered 
two of them 
about 
1619. 
These 
two were subsequently 
rediscovered 
by Poinsot, 
who also discovered 
the other 
two, in 1809. 
As shown 
by Cauchy, 
they 
are stellated 
forms 
of the 
DODECAHEDRON 
and ICOSAHEDRON. 
The 
Kepler-Poinsot 
solids, 
illustrated 
above, 
are 
known 
as the 
GREAT 
DODECAHEDRON, 
GREAT 
Icos- 
AHEDRON, 
GREAT 
STELLATED 
DODECAHEDRON, 
and 
SMALL 
STELLATED 
DODECAHEDRON. 
Cauchy 
(1813) 
proved 
that 
these four exhaust 
all possibilities 
for regu- 
lar star polyhedra 
(Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
A table 
listing 
these 
solids,

The polyhedra 
{ !,5} 
and (5, $} fail to satisfy the POLY- 
HEDRAL 
FORMULA 
where 
V is the number 
of faces, E the number 
of edges, 
and F the number 
of faces, despite 
the fact that 
formula 
holds for all ordinary 
polyhedra 
(Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
This 
unexpected 
result 
led none less than 
Schlgfli 
(1860) 
to conclude 
that 
they 
could 
not exist. 
In 4-D, 
there 
are 10 Kepler-Poinsot 
solids, 
and 
in n- 
D with 
n > 
5, there 
are none. 
In 
4-D, 
nine 
of the 
solids 
have-the 
same 
VERTICES 
as {3,3,5},

the 
tenth 
has the same
