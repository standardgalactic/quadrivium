About Mathew Patterson 
Active on the Web since GeoCities was cutting edge and the horizontal rule was king, 
Mathew Patterson has worked as a web designer for companies that include the Australian

intense table tennis sessions. Since joining Campaign Monitor, Mathew has spoken at con­

famously had a public disagreement with Jeffrey Zeldman about whether email should actually 
be designed. 
Based just outside of Sydney with his wife and son, Mathew has reviewed more email 
newsletters than you could possibly imagine, including a surprising number that feature 
alpacas. Find out more (except about the alpacas) at http://mrpatto.com.

Foreword  
For a lot of designers, the job ends the moment the site launches. You’ve polished 
the design, built the CMS, and the happy client’s check is in the mail. Next, please. 
Unfortunately, there’s a big opportunity being missed here. 
Launching a great website is one thing. But as a designer, you can also play a key 
role in ensuring that website achieves the actual goals for which it was designed. 
As well as leading to a more satisfied client, it can provide an additional revenue 
stream for your business and help set you apart from your competition. 
Whether your client’s goal is to sell widgets, drive membership, or build a passionate 
audience, email marketing (done correctly) is one of the most effective ways to 
achieve it. It’s that “done correctly” bit that is often overlooked, and it makes all 
the difference in the world. 
When we launched Campaign Monitor in 2004, email marketing truly was a dark 
art. Tips on designing emails, getting them delivered, and offering the service to 
your clients were nonexistent. Since that time, we’ve spent countless hours research­
ing the best way for designers to plan, design, and build email marketing programs 
that achieve the best results possible for their clients. 
For the first time ever, all of this research and experience has been collated, updated, 
and refined into a single resource. Not only will you learn how to offer results-
driven email marketing to your clients, you’ll also find practical tips on selling this 
service to your clients and creating a passive income stream for your design business. 
And who isn’t interested in doing that?

Preface  
How do you feel when your clients ask you to create an email newsletter design? 
I’ve witnessed two common reactions from web designers I’ve spoken to: 
■  HTML email is evil. It should never be used, and I feel a little ill for even hearing 
the words spoken. 
■  HTML email doesn’t really work; the designs never look like they’re meant to. 
In the business world, on the other hand, people neither know about nor care about 
“HTML email”; they just want a nice-looking email newsletter that drives people 
to open it and read, click, or buy. 
This book is for web designers who are looking for a way to design and build effective 
HTML emails for their clients or bosses. In the following chapters, we’ll cover how 
to plan, design, and build HTML emails that produce real results. 
Why should you trust me to tell you about it? Well, I’m a web designer too, and 
these days I’m part of the Campaign Monitor team, where we spend all day research­
ing and reading some terrific email newsletters. I can tell you without a doubt that 
it’s possible to produce truly excellent emails that work whether read using Gmail 
or Pine (a text-based email client that had its heyday in the early nineties). 
My goal is for you to reach the end of this book with all the skills and information 
you need to be able to confidently offer your clients email newsletter design that 
they’ll be happy to pay for. Let’s get started!

Who Should Read This Book  
This book is aimed at front-end web designers looking to expand the range of services 
they offer their clients to include HTML email. You should already have at least 
intermediate knowledge of HTML and CSS, as we’ll be applying those skills to the 
slightly different medium of HTML email. 
What’s in This Book 
By the end of this book, you’ll be able to take your HTML and CSS skills and deploy 
them to build beautiful, effective, and compatible HTML emails. You’ll also have 
a good idea of how to communicate with your clients about their email campaigns, 
and how to integrate email services into your or your company’s offerings. 
This book comprises the following six chapters. Read them in order from beginning 
to end to gain a complete understanding of the subject, or skip around if you only 
need a refresher on a particular topic. 
Chapter 1: Why Email? 
Before we dive into learning all the ins and outs of HTML email, we’ll have a 
quick look at why email is important, and why it should be part of your web 
design arsenal. With any luck, I’ll succeed in convincing you that, far from being 
a dark art practiced only by unscrupulous marketers, the design and construction 
of HTML email is a core part of designing for the Web. 
Chapter 2: Planning an Email Campaign 
As with any kind of design, the most important work happens before you even 
turn on your computer or pull out your sketch paper and pencils. This chapter 
covers how to discuss a new project with your client to gain all the information 
you need beforehand, and how to formulate a clear plan that will let you proceed 
with designing and building an effective HTML email campaign, hassle-free. 
Chapter 3: Design for the Inbox 
This is where the real fun starts. With a clear plan in hand, we can now set 
about the task of designing our email. In this chapter, you’ll learn the key ways 
in which design for the inbox differs from design for the browser, and how to 
embrace this new set of constraints. Everything you take for granted in the web 
design world—from layout, to imagery, to typography—needs to be re-evaluated

when designing HTML emails, and this chapter is your guidebook to that exotic 
new land. 
Chapter 4: Coding your Emails 
HTML in email is exactly the same as HTML in web pages—in 1999. While 
browsers have leaped ahead in CSS support in recent years, email clients have 
stagnated or, worse, regressed. You’ll need to dig out your table-based layout 
techniques from your bottom drawer, hold your nose, and dive in. Fortunately, 
this chapter will give you the lowdown on which CSS selectors and properties, 
as well as which other technologies, are available to you in the current crop of 
email software. You’ll also learn the key tips and tricks to achieving reliable, 
compatible layout with a minimum of tears. 
Chapter 5: Understanding Permission 
Unlike web pages, which are generally only loaded when a browser user chooses 
to do so, HTML emails often arrive unbidden. As a consequence, they often 
meet with a less than favorable response from many readers. What’s more, 
they’re also regulated by a number of laws that vary between countries. In this 
chapter, we’ll explain the best ways of dealing with the issue of permission, to 
keep your recipients happy and your clients on the right side of the law. 
Chapter 6: Selling Email to Your Clients 
All the skills you’ve learned throughout the book amount to nothing if you’re 
unable to convince your client to pay for them. But we thought of that. So that’s 
why there’s a whole chapter on how to present your new skills, integrate them 
into your service offers, and make your clients realize that email is a huge, un­
tapped market where you can help them gain the jump on their competitors.

Chapter1 
Why Email? 
Email has been around forever, it seems. In this age of shiny web applications and 
mobile computing, is there still a role for email? If there is, how and why should 
web designers be a part of that? 
Email: The Heart of the Internet 
When Oprah has one million Twitter followers, and your mother is waiting for you 
to accept her friend request on Facebook, surely we are officially in the age of Web 
2.0? Perhaps not. December 2009 research in the US shows that less than half of all 
internet users are involved in online social networks.1 
The same study showed that 89% of those same internet users are sending or reading 
email, the highest percentage of the study. 
Whether at work or home, almost everyone who’s on the Internet at all is using 
email, and there are no signs of that number declining. Certainly some activities—like 
photo sharing and status updates—that used to occur via email are now separated

out into other applications, but email still remains the one online communication 
tool that everyone understands. 
Where websites rely on you visiting them, email comes right to your inbox, and 
because of this it feels somehow more important and personal. Businesses every­
where know this, and so a relatively small but outperforming email marketing in­
dustry has grown. Wait, don’t panic! Email marketing is a lot more than mail-order 
brides and genuine replica watches. 
Every day, millions of businesses—from sole traders to multinationals—send email 
to their clients, subscribers, suppliers, and partners. Commercial email returned a 
whopping $43.62 for every dollar spent on it in 2009, according to the Direct Mar­
keting Association’s Power of Direct economic-impact study.2 With email marketing 
still providing the highest return on investment of any form of marketing, it’s safe 
to say that email will be around for a long time to come. 
In 2010, with the world still recovering from a global financial scare, email is a low-
cost, high-return medium that appeals to businesses. For web designers, there’s the 
opportunity to add email design to their services and give clients another way to 
reach their goals. 
Email’s Undeserved Bad Rap 
Email, especially HTML email, receives a bad rap in general, especially from web 
designers. For some, it has become a synonym for spam, thanks to the very real 
problem of mass unsolicited sending. Email done right, on the other hand, is a 
powerful tool that can produce real value for both the sender and recipient. 
Jeanne S. Jennings, in her email marketing bible, The Email Marketing Kit (Mel­
bourne: SitePoint, 2007), provides one of the best summaries on the benefits of 
email marketing. I’ve paraphrased it here: 
■  Email is cost-effective. While there are costs involved in email marketing, such 
as copywriting and design, your production and delivery costs are significantly 
cheaper than that of direct mail. For the same amount, you can send out around 
a hundred emails for every direct mail letter.

3
Why Email? 
■  Email builds relationships. While email may not be the only method that helps 
connect you with your audience, it’s the least intrusive—enabling the recipient 
to respond at their leisure. A well thought-out email plan can create and 
strengthen customer loyalty. 
■  Email is active. Email marketing actively sends your message to interested people, 
rather than relying on them to find you each time. 
■  Email provides timely results. The time between distribution and delivery of an 
email marketing campaign can be measured in minutes rather than days. This 
allows you to choose the time you deliver your messages with more precision, 
and also means results will become evident quickly after you start your campaign. 
■  Email is quick to produce. Once you’re set up to run email campaigns, you can 
easily launch a major marketing initiative to all your customers in a few hours. 
There’s no other direct marketing source that could be implemented in this sort 
of time period. 
■  Email accommodates hyperlinks. With just a click of the mouse, a customer can 
go from reading your marketing message to purchasing at your online checkout. 
This speedy one-step process is what marketing dreams are made of. 
■  Email provides detailed feedback. Email marketing allows for comprehensive 
feedback. You can measure how many of your emails were successfully delivered 
and opened, how many times your links were clicked on, and, importantly, how 
many sales you made. This also enables thorough campaign analysis. 
■  Email enables affordable segmentation and targeting. Email marketing is agile, 
allowing you to vary the content sent to customers on your distribution list. You 
can segment, that is, split your lists based on market segments such as geographic 
location, purchase history, gender, and age to send tailored messages, improving 
your conversion rate. 
■  Email plays well with others. Email works well when part of an integrated direct 
marketing campaign. While other methods can come across as disruptive or 
pushy, email is able to prepare your customers for a sales call—or as a follow-
up to a face-to-face sale—without getting in a customer’s face.

The Different Types of Email 
Communication 
Email itself has limitless uses, and email marketing is more than just sending out 
an email with a special deal on a product. There are a number of approaches your 
clients can use to engage their audiences, and each type of email communication 
sent will deliver varied benefits, and require different design and planning processes. 
Let’s take a closer look at all of them. In specific industries there may be subcategor­
ies within each of the broad groupings I’ve outlined here, but these are the common 
email types you’re likely to be asked to design. 
Email Newsletters 
As a basis for an ongoing business relationship, there’s nothing better than an email 
newsletter providing reliable, regularly delivered, quality information on relevant 
and interesting topics. By their very nature, newsletters are sent regularly. A company 
will usually set a schedule to mail subscribers weekly, every two weeks, or monthly, 
enabling the company to regularly promote its news and events in a timely way. 
Email newsletters are widely used. They’re a common, proven communications 
tool that help countless organizations achieve their brand awareness, customer re­
tention, ad revenue, and other goals. While a client may yet be be at the stage to 
compile enough content for a subscriber list on a regular basis, very few of your 
clients are unlikely to see the business benefits of email newsletters. If they don’t 
want to start one just yet, they’re likely to reconsider in the not-too-distant future. 
Catalog Emails 
Catalog emails are the electronic newsletters of the online retailer. Where a service 
organization might send an email newsletter, a company that sells products may 
prefer mailing an electronic catalog to subscribers on a regular basis. 
Depending on the retailer, the catalog can contain the same sections each time, or 
each issue might vary from the last. In building a catalog email, you should agree 
on a set number of items to include in each issue, as you would in an email news­
letter. This will keep the preparation of the creative as straightforward as possible 
each time, while keeping your client’s email budget on track. Bear in mind though

Why Email? 
that laying out catalogs can be more finicky, time-consuming work than producing 
a simple electronic newsletter. 
Announcement Emails 
Announcement emails are usually commissioned and produced on an ad hoc basis, 
when the client has time-critical information to tell their subscribers. Perhaps your 
client has a limited-time offer that they want to promote. They might have been 
invited at the last minute to speak at a conference or industry event, and want to 
encourage clients to attend. A host of possibilities can spark the need to send an 
announcement email. 
One-off announcement emails are usually short and contain just one call to action. 
Often, there’ll be minimal lead time for the announcement, so there’s a need to turn 
the job around quickly. If your client believes they’re likely to use announcement 
emails often, you might offer to prepare a suitable template in advance; this will 
reduce the time it will take to get their announcements out to subscribers. 
Press Releases 
Although they sound like announcements, press releases are more public relations 
than sales. Companies from all industries prepare press releases around corporate 
and governance developments, product or service launches and upgrades, community 
contribution and involvement, and so on. 
Your clients might produce media releases frequently, but they’re unlikely to write 
them on a regular basis—every Monday, for example. In fact, time frames around 
media release mailing tend to be tight at best, and unpredictable at worst. Again, 
offering to prepare a media release email template for clients who have active public 
relations strategies might save time and hassle when it comes to distributing the 
release. This type is likely to differ from one used to make announcements. 
Sales and Sign-up Process Emails 
If your clients sell products or services through their websites, they may need to 
prepare emails that support or augment the purchase process. If they accept any 
sort of user sign-up through their sites—for a newsletter, for competitions, or even

6 
from visitors who want to register their interest in an activity that the company’s 
undertaking—there’s the potential for you to add value. 
As well as helping your client plan an email sequence, you might design email 
templates and create landing pages to support the sales or sign-up process. A 
landing page is the first page of a site that a visitor sees after clicking through from 
an email. Perhaps you’ll also set the messages to mail through an email 
autoresponder, and test the sequences before they’re made live. Why not tie in 
monitoring to help your client assess the success of each email? Although sales 
process emails may seem cut and dried, you can see there’s a lot of scope for design­
ers to show off their skills here. 
The Opportunity for Web Designers 
Just as the vast majority of websites are rather poorly designed, most commercial 
emails fail to make good use of the capabilities of plain text or HTML and CSS. 
Competition for web design work is immense, but right now there are few web 
design firms and freelance designers willing to offer HTML email design as part of 
their service. Many refuse to do it, or will leave their clients to work it out for 
themselves. As noted designer Jeremy Keith of Clearleft told me, “I’ve never done 
an HTML email in my life, and I don’t intend to do so.” 
Since you have at least picked up this book, you are already well ahead of the 
competition. As you work through the chapters you’ll see that it’s relatively easy 
to produce emails that are far better than most of what’s being sent out right now. 
Check out Chapter 6 in particular for the rundown on how to encourage your clients 
to be really involved in effective email marketing and communication. 
So, now that I’ve outlined why you should learn to design and build HTML emails, 
it’s time to dirty our hands with the how. As with all design, the first step is to plan, 
plan, and plan some more.

Chapter2 
Planning an Email Campaign 
How hard can it be to design and build an HTML email, really? I mean, even my 
mom can send emails (though she still has some problems with the caps lock key). 
Sending emails may be easy, but running an email campaign that delivers the desired 
results can be a lot more complicated. Using a simple planning process, we can 
build a solid base from which to design, and save ourselves a lot of time and hassle. 
In this chapter, we’ll go through the all-important planning phase of an email 
campaign. Then, in Chapter 3, we’ll work from that plan to create our email’s design. 
Planning Is Essential 
As designers, we might consider the planning phase to be outside our scope and 
handled by the client instead. Often a client will have the same opinion, relegating 
a designer to the technical work and the pretty pictures. Although this is a valid 
approach, it can lead to a beautifully designed but ineffectual email. That’s bad for 
your client, and for your prospects of future work.

If we can help our clients to create campaigns that actually work, they’ll be happier, 
and we can charge more for our services as specialized email campaign consultants. 
We’ll discuss this in more detail in Chapter 6. 
If you have ever worked on a website larger than a few pages, you will know how 
frustrating it is when you’ve sunk hours of work into the project, only to find out 
that the client has changed their mind about what the website is actually meant to 
do. Without a clear plan up front, a website can often end up being a collection of 
disconnected pages lacking the structure to help visitors make sense of it. An email 
can suffer exactly the same problems, albeit on a smaller scale. 
Of course, we’re talking about business, rather than personal, emails here. There’s 
no real planning required to send a photo of your cat to your friend; you just need 
to remember to actually attach the image. If we want to create a really useful email 
newsletter, we’ll need to do more planning beforehand. What’s the purpose of the 
email? Who are the people it will be sent to, and what are they expecting to receive? 
What will success look like for this project? 
When you’re approached to create an HTML email, it will be your job to find answers 
to these questions before you crack open Photoshop or your favorite text editor. 
Otherwise, you may end up with a gorgeous, beautifully coded email that’s only 
ever opened by filtering software and cats walking across keyboards. 
Rather than just explain how you can apply planning principles to your next project, 
we’ll take a typical client and work through the planning, designing, and coding 
processes required. I always find that building it for real is a much faster way to 
learn than just reading the theory. 
In a hurry? 
If you bought this book in a desperate rush because your client is demanding an 
HTML email and you’ve never built one in your life, substitute your own details 
with that of your client’s in our case study, and we’ll walk through each step. In 
this chapter we’ll plan out the email, and in subsequent chapters we’ll design, 
code, and send it.

Planning an Email Campaign 
Meeting Our Client  
Today’s busy supervillain has no time to do basic death trap maintenance, or deal 
with the Home Owners Association over concerns that their volcano lair is “not in 
keeping with the area.” 
Enter the henchman (or henchperson, if you prefer). Every villain needs at least one 
henchman to fire inaccurately, put gas in the submarine, and laugh deferentially at 
all the right moments. 
But good henching doesn’t just occur by chance, and successful henchpeople need 
to be on a path of continual improvement. Modern Henchman magazine is the 
journal of choice for the professional henching community. 
We’ve visited them in their decidedly nonsecret lair and chatted about their ideas 
for a new email newsletter, and they’ve agreed to work with us to make it happen. 
To kick it off, we’ll need to answer some basic questions. These questions will be 
always be more or less the same, whether you’re working for a client, an internal 
team, or your own startup (in the latter case, they’re questions you need to be asking 
yourself). 
You can find these questions in an editable document included in the book’s code 
archive download, and use them for your own projects. 
The Modern Henchman Magazine Client Briefing 
Who are you sending these emails to? 
■ Current subscribers of the print magazine 
■ People who sign up on our website 
■ Customers who purchased from our site 
What is the main reason for sending these emails? 
To increase sales of our Modern Henchman line of products, by encouraging 
people to buy for the first time and by making readers repeat buyers 
What type of emails are you planning to send? 
■ Customer newsletters 
www.ebook777.com

10 
■ Subscription reminders 
■ Invoices and purchase receipts 
What type of content do you want to send? 
■ Special offers 
■ Informative articles that tie in to our products 
How often would you be sending emails? 
The newsletter will be sent once a month, with other reminders and notifications 
as required 
Do you have an existing visual design you would like the email to match? 
Yes, the website at modernhenchman.com 
Do you have examples of other emails that you like? 
■ Amazon.com product emails 
■ Apple sales emails 
Our client realizes that subscribers with an ongoing connection and past purchasers 
are the most likely people to purchase from them in the future. Sending an email 
newsletter or offer to their customers once or twice a month is a very cost-effective 
way of staying in touch. 
It also keeps them in their customers’ minds, ensuring that when they need a freeze 
ray or an exploding hat, modernhenchman.com is their first stop. 
Now that we have our client brief, we can start to work out what needs to be done 
in order to complete the project. The first step is to define in more detail what a 
successful project will look like. 
Setting Goals 
Any time you approach a design challenge, you need to have a clear target in mind. 
This is no less important for an email newsletter than it is for a website or printed 
matter. 
Taking the client’s answers from our initial brief, we can restate them in the form 
of measurable goals. More than just measurable, the goals should also be as specific 
as possible.

Planning an Email Campaign 
Our client has said they want to increase sales to print subscribers, and convert new 
customers from email-only subscribers to active customers. That’s a good start, but 
it’s wise to try to nail down some more specific goals. For example, what exactly 
do they mean by “increase sales”? Is it enough to have just one more sale? That 
might sound ridiculous, but there are some products and services where a single 
sale could pay for an entire year of email campaigns. Your client may sell consulting 
services for thousands of dollars per engagement, or they may sell Web 2.0 gradient 
stickers for a dollar per box. We need to be detailed and specific in order to set 
useful goals. 
Some clients may be uncomfortable giving you specific financial information; they 
might instead state their goals in terms of the number of visitors arriving at their 
site from links in the email. If they know that 1.8% of website visits convert into a 
sale, knowing how many people visit the website from the email can be roughly 
converted to a dollar value. 
Sit down with your client and show them some example goals you have come up 
with based on their brief. That may lead to follow-up discussion that can help them 
clarify in their own minds what they want to achieve through their emails. For our 
client, we might suggest this primary goal: generate at least $400 in sales directly 
from newsletter subscribers within the first week of each email being sent. 
Your client may not have a goal that’s directly tied to a financial return. For some 
businesses, a reply from the reader might be exactly what they want to achieve. 
Here are some other examples of goals you could consider: 
■ Re-establish direct contact with 5 previous clients 
■ 40% of subscribers open the email 
■ 20% of subscribers click at least one link 
■ 30 people visit this specific page on the site 
You get the idea. All these goals can be easily measured, so you’ll be able to 
identify when you’ve achieved them. Sometimes that won’t be possible. For example, 
it may take years for a customer to commit to buying a new warehouse layout system 
or mainframe installation. The measurable goals in those cases could be about 
maintaining a relationship, where the measurement is email replies received from 
the customer.

This process is about more than just producing goals, it is also to encourage our 
clients—and ourselves as designers—to think carefully about why we are sending 
the emails in the first place. After all, if the person or company sending the email 
does not really know the point, the chances of the recipient caring about it are very 
poor indeed. 
Measuring Success 
Once we have one or more goals in place, we’ll need to set up the tools or processes 
that will be used to tell if those goals have been met. That might include sales figures 
from a certain department, reports from your email service provider, or analytics 
from the website. 
If you’re using specialized software (whether internal or external) to send the emails, 
a lot of these measurements may be provided for you as part of the package. The 
kinds of figures you can expect to be able to track are: 
Open rates 
How many of the people who received the email actually read it? This number 
is calculated by monitoring the download of tracking images inside each email. 
Unfortunately, many email clients don’t download images by default, so not 
every open can be recorded. Similarly, some email clients only show plain text, 
with no downloaded images. 
Click rates 
How many of the people who opened the email actually clicked on a link? 
Typically, email sending services redirect each link through their own tracking 
service to record those clicks. 
Forwards 
How many people actually used the “send to a friend” function to forward the 
email? (Assuming your software has this function.) 
Unsubscribes 
How many people chose to unsubscribe from further emails using the software’s 
built-in unsubscribe system?

Planning an Email Campaign 
Conversion rate 
How many people who clicked through went on to actually buy, or download 
a trial, or perform another action you can track? Software like Google Analytics 
can be used to record these actions, and tie them back to particular sources, 
including your email campaigns. 
The most important measurement isn’t the raw numbers themselves, but the change 
in these numbers from one campaign to the next (also called the trend). After we 
send each campaign, we’ll be making changes to the email content and design, even 
to the day of the week and time of day that we send. The historical measurements 
will quickly tell us if our changes are successful or not. 
We’ve reached the point where we have goals for the email campaign, and we know 
how to tell if we’ve reached those goals. Only now should we start putting together 
a plan for the HTML email itself. 
Emails are built with the same technologies as web sites: HTML and CSS. However, 
there are some big differences in what makes an appropriate design for email. 
Planning Your Content 
It’s tempting for web designers to think of HTML email as a little one-page website. 
After all, it’s just HTML and CSS, and a good number of people will be viewing the 
email in a web browser anyway, right? 
That’s all true, but websites and emails really are two different media. Just as print 
designers had to acclimatize to the unique constraints and opportunities of the Web, 
web designers working with email also need to adjust their thinking. 
An Email Is Not a Website 
We tend to think of websites as being an online storefront, in that people actively 
come to our site, whether directly, by searching, or by following a link. When a 
visitor comes to our website, they normally have some idea already about what 
they’re expecting to find. Visually, the site takes up their full browser window. 
An email is a different case. Your inbox is more like your house than a storefront. 
Emails come to you without you taking any action. When they arrive, the visible

area of the email may only be a fraction of the size of a web browser window. Take 
a look at the typical email software shown in Figure 2.1. 
Figure 2.1. Standard email software in action 
Notice how busy this window is compared to a web browser? The actual email takes 
up only a small percentage of space at the bottom, and is surrounded by other items 
competing for attention. Folders, notes, and other emails fight to be noticed. 
So our email is going to have a much harder time being understood than a website 
displaying the same content. This will affect the way we design our email, and the 
way we write our content. As designers, we need to be respectful of the fact that 
our readers (or our client’s readers) have let us invade their personal space. 
Unless readers are devoted “Inbox Zero” converts, our email will be just another 
item in a long, long list that’s interrupting their real work. We’re asking them to pay 
attention to our email, and usually to take some kind of action. In return, we owe 
them an email that doesn’t take up more time than is necessary, is easy to read, and 
is actually useful. 
Before we dig into the visual aspects of HTML email design, we need to know what 
content our design is going to be centered around. Every client has their own idea 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
15
Planning an Email Campaign 
of what should go into an email, and most will have a hugely inflated sense of how 
important their email is to the people who receive it. 
Email in the Real World 
Clients have a vision of their readers sitting in their chairs, hitting “Get Mail” every 
few seconds just to hear the glorious sound of a new email arriving. The reality, as 
we all know from our own experience, is rarely as positive. To be worthy of more 
than a cursory glance and a swift trip to the junk mail folder, our email must have 
immediate, obvious value. This starts with the subject line revealing who the email 
is from, and what value it offers the recipient. 
“Information overload” is a horrible phrase, but we all know what it means. Too 
much information is given to us, and there’s too little time to actually use it. Websites 
can be content-rich and complex, but at least you can ignore sections of a website. 
An email is much more invasive, coming directly to your computer and into your 
face. While there are no absolute rules, generally our subscribers will be happier 
with a shorter email than one that tries to pour a website’s worth of content into 
that tiny email pane. 
It can be tough to sell this idea to clients. They tend to think that everything they 
produce is important and interesting to every subscriber. Of course, they’re unlikely 
to treat the emails they receive with the same rapt attention they expect for the 
emails they send—and this might be worth pointing out. 
With those general concepts in mind, let’s sit down with our client and hash out 
the content for their newsletter. 
Planning the Modern Henchman Newsletter 
Our client has provided us with this list of content for the Modern Henchman 
newsletter: 
■ information on the featured product of the month 
■ teasers for stories in the magazine 
■ a link to send the email on to a friend 
■ a featured article 
www.ebook777.com

16 
Now we need a way to prioritize this list and narrow it down. A simple way to do 
this is by asking one more question: “What is the one action you want your reader 
to take after they read the email?” Modern Henchman request that “the reader should 
click through to learn more about our featured product” when they receive their 
regular monthly email. 
Your client might seek a different preferred action from their readers, such as 
sending a reply, visiting a certain page, or forwarding on the email. We could go on 
to select perhaps two or three desired actions. After that, though, we risk having so 
many possible choices that the reader is paralyzed into taking no action at all. 
Now we can rank our content according to what best supports the desired action, 
and what will most likely meet our overall goals for the email campaigns. 
Modern Henchman might end up with a priority list like this: 
■  information on the featured product of the month (this directly supports our 
primary action) 
■  featured article (building our reputation for knowledge) 
■  link to send the email onto a friend 
■  teasers for other stories 
With this list we can now create an outline for the newsletter, establishing a structure 
we can carry through from edition to edition. Based on responses from subscribers, 
we may change this over time, but always keeping our goals clearly in view. 
Our final step before we launch into the visual design is to gather all the content 
for our first email. This can sometimes be a time-consuming task, typically relying 
on the client to provide material. 
For Modern Henchman, we can grab a lot of the content for a typical issue from 
their website, which has the article archive and full product descriptions.

17
Planning an Email Campaign 
It’s Okay to Reuse Content 
While you might think that repeating content from the blog or website is a cheat, 
the reality is that most newsletter subscribers will rarely visit the website unless 
they’re making a specific transaction. The most recent statistics show that more 
than 90% of internet users still have no understanding of what RSS is, let alone 
how to use it to keep up with websites. 
Even at Campaign Monitor, where customers are mostly internet-savvy web de­
signers, we receive a much bigger response from our email campaigns than from 
our blog entries. So reusing materials from the website is a smart way to go, and 
can save a lot of time. 
At this stage, we just need representative content that we can build our design 
around, so creating a dummy sample issue with some content from the website is 
a good idea. 
Lorem Ipsum 
I recommend you avoid using lorem ipsum text as filler, even though it’s common 
in website design. Too many emails (and too many websites) have been designed 
using placeholder that turned out being totally different in length, style, and shape 
from the actual content. The design has then had to be tweaked, well after it 
should’ve been finalized. 
HTML Email Q&A 
Before we move onto designing our email in Chapter 3, we’ll go over some common 
email questions your client may ask, and suggest how to handle them. 
How long should an email be? 
As short as you can make it, without making it useless. There are some businesses 
sending very long and complex material in email form, but they’re rare. The typical 
inbox is exceedingly full already, so is an unpleasant space in which to spend time. 
So get in, get your message across, and get out. 
From reviewing many thousands of newsletters for Campaign Monitor, the typical 
length for a content-heavy newsletter (as opposed to an invitation or simple notice) 
www.ebook777.com

Create Stunning HTML Email That Just Works! 
18 
is two or three screens’ worth. That seems reasonable. As always, keep your client’s 
audience in mind, as their needs or expectations may be different. 
Should I put the full articles in the email, or just 
teasers and links to the site? 
If shorter is better, linking to the full article online is often the way to go. If you 
have expansive content, putting it all in the email will be overwhelming. On the 
other hand, if you can write a shorter version, or carry your point across in a few 
paragraphs, you could save your reader time by giving them everything they need 
without having to click through. 
How often should I send emails? 
As always there is no single answer, but a 2009 survey1 found that 73% of respon­
dents cited “sending too frequently” as the main reason for opting out of an email 
mailing list. Conversely, email that’s too infrequent risks subscribers forgetting they 
ever signed up, or finding another solution to the problem you’re trying to solve for 
them. 
In general, it’s better to err towards too few emails than too many. The answer in 
any specific case will depend on what the subscribers expect, as well as the 
timeliness of the content. 
But then, you can simply ask your subscribers—and even people who’ve just unsub­
scribed—how often they’d prefer to receive your content. Check out a post on this 
topic on the Campaign Monitor blog.2 
What is the best time to send? 
Endless theories have been proposed and tested about the perfect time to send an 
email campaign. Studies have been unhelpful, because the mystical perfect day and 
time seems to shift unpredictably from one study to the next.

19
Planning an Email Campaign 
See Email Marketing Reports3 for some study results and a few ideas that can help 
you find a suitable starting point. 
Of course, you also need to consider your content and your audience; some types 
of content will lend themselves to a Monday morning arrival, others to a lazy Sunday 
afternoon. The only really useful answer to this question is, “Try a few different 
times and see what works best for you.” 
Is it okay to buy or rent an email list? 
Generally, no, it isn’t. Although there are services and products that claim to have 
fully opt-in up-to-date databases, you have no real way of confirming that. Most 
email service providers and anti-spam systems take a very dim view of purchased 
email lists. The risk is too high, and the chance of success too low to bother with. 
Take the slower approach of building your own opt-in list over time, by interacting 
with people yourself. 
What is a good open rate? 
This is yet another question for which there is no simple answer. There is such 
enormous variation between industries, companies, and recipient lists that overall 
statistics are unhelpful. Still, we all know clients will ask anyway, so it’s good to 
have some general idea. Broadly, a typical range is 20-40% of the subscriber list. 
Read more about how open rates are usually measured and what’s considered normal 
for different industries and sectors on the Campaign Monitor website.4 
Often the real question your client is asking is, “Why don’t I have 100% open rates?” 
so you’ll need to discuss their expectations and the reality of email marketing with 
them. 
How many clicks should I expect? 
This follows on from the previous question, but is even less likely to have a reliable 
answer. Email marketing industry reports tend to quote a 2-15% unique clickthrough

20 
rate as typical. This means for every 100 people who open your email, less than 15 
would typically click a link. 
Business to business emails are often at the higher end of that range, and mass 
market consumer emails the lower. Emails that are targeted and valuable to the re­
cipient can go much higher, of course. 
How can I avoid my email being filtered? 
Use magic, if possible. Otherwise, you’re unfortunately stuck in the land of trial 
and error. No email service can honestly guarantee your emails will escape filtering, 
except in very particular circumstances. The vast majority of the time, it’s your ac­
tual content (subject line, message body) and possibly your “From” address that 
filters are checking. Your email service provider is unable to control this, so it’s 
largely up to you. 
Some topics, such as pharmaceuticals and mortgages, are so heavily targeted by 
spammers that legitimate senders will always struggle to avoid filters. 
The best approach is firstly to avoid highly common spam words (good luck if you 
ever need to send an email campaign about Viagra!), and then test your email with 
as many different clients and filters as you can. If your email is filtered in one or 
two of the tests, but the rest are okay, you’re probably fine. If your email is system­
atically filtered, there could be a broader problem. 
In that case, try using one of the email testing services that give spam filter results 
with reasons why the email failed. Otherwise, cut out half the content and send the 
rest. If it passes, there could be a problem phrase or word in the half you omitted. 
There are no easy solutions to spam filtering, but you need to make your clients 
aware that even the same email client in two different installations can behave dif­
ferently. The best you can do is to test, test, test.

Planning an Email Campaign 
Summary  
In this chapter, we’ve seen why it’s vital to incorporate a planning phase into any 
HTML email project, and what that planning entails. We’ve learned a little bit about 
how email differs from the broader field of web design, and we’ll be delving deeper 
into that topic in Chapter 3 as we discuss the design considerations that are unique 
to email. 
I hope I’ve shown you how, by communicating clearly with your clients up front, 
asking the right questions, and giving them the right information, you can steer your 
project towards success before you so much as pick up a sketchpad. 
In Chapter 3, we’ll set about actually designing the Modern Henchman newsletter, 
and along the way we’ll learn the peculiarities of HTML email design in a broader 
sense.

Design for the Inbox 
Designing an email requires the same HTML and CSS skills you already possess, 
but requires that you apply them to a different medium and new design context. In 
this chapter we’ll explore the ways in which an email differs from a website, and 
how that should affect our design. 
We’ll also look at the design elements that make up a successful HTML email, and 
uncover the unique constraints of email client software. 
Does email really need designing? 
Every major email client, from Outlook to Gmail to Apple Mail, is set up by default 
to send in HTML format, and comes with a bunch of tools and options to format 
HTML. So if the tools to create and format HTML email are so simple and widely 
accessible, why would you even want to involve a designer in the first place? Isn’t 
that a bit like your parents demanding a written budget before you buy lunch at the 
school cafeteria? 
In fact, one of the main reasons designers have historically been against the very 
idea of HTML email is the poor quality of the emails they’re used to seeing. You

know exactly what I mean: emails that use every font in the drop-down list, with a 
heavy preference for Comic Sans in 24pt hot pink. The ones with rainbow back­
grounds and little animated cats at the bottom. 
“Look how ugly they are!” designers proclaim, and promptly vow to never support 
HTML email. Unfortunately, in the real world, their valiant stand fails to create a 
turning point; email software manufacturers won’t take away their users’ cherished 
fonts and colors. For every designer who refuses to create well-thought-out, appealing 
emails, there are 24 marketing assistants with access to Microsoft Word and a massive 
collection of clip-art CDs. Refusing to design HTML emails doesn’t stop them being 
sent, it just ensures that they’ll remain hideous eyesores. 
So yes, it’s actually important to have design input into emails—at least as far as 
publication-type emails such as newsletters are concerned. We can all be part of 
the solution to horrible-looking email, instead of just complaining about it. A well 
designed email is more readable, attractive, and effective at relaying information. 
Designing Plain Text Email 
Before we launch into a discussion about designing HTML email, I’ll briefly touch 
on the importance of designing plain text email. You don’t have to be sending some 
fancy web-page-in-my-inbox email to benefit from design skills. Even plain text, 
the base format for written communication, needs to be designed. 
Have you ever received plain text newsletters? An excellent example is the Good 
Experience1 newsletter (which is well worth subscribing to). Have a look at the 
screenshot in Figure 3.1.

Notice anything? How about those typographic characters posing as borders? This 
is a common approach, using asterisks, equal signs, or underscores to simulate the 
kind of design elements that books and magazines use all the time. 
Even print books that are 100% text undergo the design treatment. Typography is 
well worth studying as a web designer, and there are some excellent resources online 
from which to start. 
Though many maintain that plain text is all you need for an email, a big old block 
of unformatted text can be very hard to read. Look at what’s missing: 
■  ability to control text size for headings 
■  ability to emphasize text through bold or italic type 
■  possibility of using a display font to draw attention to a subtitle 
■  control over margins and padding to increase clarity and allow the email to be 
quickly scanned for the most important information 
Thoughtful senders use a variety of techniques to work around these limitations, 
like the character borders above. Ultimately though, these are often little more than 
clever hacks, using characters differently from what they were designed for in order 
to improve the readability of a limited medium. 
Despite this, it’s important to learn how to make plain text email as clear and 
readable as possible. Even if you’re planning to send only HTML emails, you should 
always provide a plain text alternative. Most email newsletter programs will send 
a multi-part email consisting of both an HTML version and a plain text alternative, 
so that the recipient’s email client can show either according to its capabilities and 
settings. 
Guidelines for a Readable Plain Text Email 
■  Use lots of whitespace to avoid having a huge gray blob of text. Leave space 
between paragraphs and after headings, and aim for paragraphs of four to five 
lines. 
■  Keep your line width to about 60 characters. This is a comfortable column width 
to read, and also maintains compatibility with some older systems that can mess 
up your formatting if you have longer lines.

27
Design for the Inbox 
■  Use short URLs wherever possible. Again, longer URLs can break up and become 
hard to click on, or copy and paste. 
■ Make your copy easy to scan by dividing it with clear headings.

Now we have a readable and effective plain text email template that we can use for 
all our future newsletters. This presents a challenge: if our readers can obtain all 
the information just fine from this plain text version, why bother with an HTML 
version? 
The Case for HTML Email 
Just because we can send HTML and CSS in an email doesn’t mean we must. The 
fact is that there are some clear benefits to an HTML email, above and beyond the 
ability to send pictures of cats with English grammar trouble. 
Have a glance at the emails shown in Figure 3.3. Here we have the same email in 
two different formats. Which one jumps out at you more? Which is faster for you 
to read? What’s the most important information in the email?

Design for the Inbox 
Figure 3.3. Plain text (left) and HTML (right) versions of the Good Experience newsletter 
Mark Hurst, the founder and sender of this newsletter, made the decision in March 
2010 to send this HTML version as well as the plain text for the first time. He imme­
diately received this comment from a subscriber: “The email is much more pleasant 
to read and the links are easily visible and inviting.” 
The HTML version is still mostly text, but it’s HTML-rendered text. Look at how 
much easier it is to spot what the sender considers the key information. Some simple 
font control and margins create an instant visual hierarchy that plain text struggles 
to establish. Even the most hardcore anti-HTML email campaigner wouldn’t get 
upset about this. As this illustrates, it’s possible to design HTML for email in a way 
that’s actually helpful, and better than the alternative. 
Designing HTML Email 
If you can agree with me that, in principle, well-designed HTML email is possible, 
the question we need to answer is, “What does a well-designed HTML email look 
like?” We’re going to try to answer that in the rest of this chapter, and then discover 
how to build it in Chapter 4. 
Along the way, we’ll think about how the concepts we’re learning can be used to 
help design an HTML email for Modern Henchman magazine.

The Design Environment for Email 
Isn’t designing an email just like designing a small, one-page web page? Well, yes, 
in many ways it is. We do use the same design tools and technologies to produce 
the final result. And the same general design principles are still in play: contrast, 
repetition, proximity, and alignment are all important. 
Any competent web designer already has the capabilities to design an HTML email. 
There are some important differences, though, and understanding these will make 
the difference between a tiny web page squished into your inbox, and a valuable 
and readable email. 
If we compare web design to email design, we can come up with a few core distinc­
tions. Let’s examine them one by one, and see what lessons we can draw from them. 
Your Subscriber May Not Read the Email 
The very first element of design that goes into an email isn’t strictly “design” at all. 
It’s copywriting. Your email can fly through spam filters like Luke Skywalker in 
the Death Star trenches and make its way successfully into the inbox, but then remain 
unopened. This is because, unlike a web page—which visitors can arrive at via links 
from other pages or search engines—an email is only ever opened when the user 
decides to open it, and often they’ll make that decision based on the subject line. 
Crafting an appealing and informative subject line is the first step in a successful 
design. We’re unable to make any visual design changes to a subject line, but as 
designers we should be involved in ensuring that it represents what’s in the email, 
and that it’s recognizable and helpful. 
If the subject line fails in its job, your beautifully crafted design will never be seen. 
There’s plenty of information out there for help on improving subject lines, as well 
as research on what makes a subject line succeed or fail.2

Design Guideline 1: Write a subject line that is … 
■ informative (mention some of the topics) 
■ short (or at least has the most important information at the start) 
■ recognizable (so that it’s consistent with other emails from your client) 
Looking Through the Rectangular Window 
Assuming we’ve done a decent job with our subject line, our email may be selected 
from the inbox and displayed in a shortened form. For desktop email clients like 
Outlook and Apple Mail, the default preview pane is a tiny rectangle of space taking 
up less than 20% of the screen, as illustrated in Figure 3.4. 
Figure 3.4. Sample screen showing preview pane size 
Imagine walking through a mall. Every store has a sign out the front, but all the 
windows are blacked out except for a square letterbox-sized peephole. To decide 
whether you want to go inside you need to peek through that slot to see what you 
can see. That’s what the preview pane is like—a limited view of your design and 
content. For that reason, it’s really important that the top of your email is informative.

If all the reader can see is 300 pixels of your background color or an unrecognizable 
logo, they have to be really keen to bother reading on. 
When we come to design our Modern Henchman email newsletter, we’ll make sure 
that those first few hundred pixels at the top (and more specifically, the top left) 
communicate useful information. 
Design Guideline 2: Find out what your email looks like in a minimal preview 
pane. 
What copy is located in the top few hundred pixels of the email? Does it entice 
people to read on? Is your header too big? 
Image Blocking 
If you’ve used any email program that renders HTML, chances are you’ll have opened 
up emails that looked like the one shown in Figure 3.5. 
Figure 3.5. All-image email with images blocked 
Instead of words or pictures, there’s a stack of blocks of various sizes, as if someone 
is losing a game of Tetris in your inbox. Most of the major email clients, including 
Outlook, Lotus Notes, and Hotmail, will not display images by default. Instead, they 
display a broken image icon or an empty rectangle. 
The reason image blocking is so common is related to the invasiveness of email that 
we discussed earlier. When emails arrive without you having taken any action, 
featuring any content imaginable, it’s easy to see how it all can go horribly wrong. 
Nobody wants to have to explain to their boss why their screen is full of images 
unsuited to the workplace. To avoid this sort of situation, the email programs insert

35
Design for the Inbox 
an extra step in the viewing process to make the reader specifically request to see 
images. 
Email software programs differ in the way they handle images by default, whether 
using a global setting, or showing images only from your known contacts, or on an 
individual email-by-email basis. In some cases, embedding the images as MIME-
encoded attachments can avoid the image blocking, which is worth knowing. 
However, sending images as attachments creates a greater risk of being filtered, 
slower download speeds, and more complex processes. And you can bet that if 
spammers start embedding all their images as attachments, the email clients will 
respond and start blocking those as well. 
The take-home message for us as email designers is that we cannot simply expect 
our readers to see the images. Added to that, many readers are unaware that images 
are missing or how to enable them, so they may just assume the email is meaningless 
or broken, and throw it out if it contains no content other than images. 
So what are we to do? Avoid images entirely? Well, you could, and in many cases 
a well-formatted HTML email without images can be highly effective and achieve 
all your goals (see the section called “Almost Image Free” in the Gallery at the end 
of this chapter for examples of this sort of email). That’s not always true, though, 
and inevitably we’ll have clients or bosses who really do have valid requirements 
for images. 
The answer is to always design knowing that your images cannot be relied on. Make 
sure that if they don’t load, the email is still readable and recognizable. 
Design Guideline 3: Always check your email with images turned off. 
Does the email still have useful, readable content? Consider especially what the 
preview pane looks like when there are no images. Do you have visible text in 
the preview area? 
Horizontally Challenged 
I remember the momentous time when 800x600 desktop resolutions were finally 
sufficiently widespread for web designers to move en masse to designing websites 
for this size. We’d been toiling away for years, squeezing websites into 600 measly

36 
pixels, so being allowed to stretch out to 760 was like moving from a camp bed up 
to a queen ensemble. 
Unfortunately, I have some bad news. When it comes to email design, you’ll need 
to go down to the garage and drag that camp bed back upstairs, because your emails 
are probably being read in a very narrow window or frame. Most people don’t open 
emails in a full-screen window; instead, they scroll through a preview pane or 
viewing column that takes up only a portion of the screen. 
Added to that, consider the poor people using mobile email clients who at best have 
a few hundred pixels with which to work. Web surfers have overcome their fear of 
scrolling vertically, but horizontal scrolling is still rare. As a result, our email designs 
will generally be quite narrow, built to work in a limited screen space. Most com­
mercial emails seem to be about 600 pixels wide at the most, which can feel almost 
claustrophobic when you are used to your 24-inch desktop monitor. This width 
restriction will naturally lead to certain design styles, such as restricting the number 
of columns and splitting the elements vertically more than horizontally. 
Design Guideline 4: Keep email designs reasonably narrow. 
A good maximum width to aim for is 600 pixels. 
Essential Elements of an Effective Email 
With our design guidelines in hand, we’re almost ready to start creating our email. 
In the same way that nearly all cars have a steering wheel, four wheels, and a 
dashboard, and that most websites have headers and footers and contact pages, 
commercial emails tend to share a basic structure. 
I’ve reviewed literally hundreds of thousands of emails over the last few years, and 
the pattern that emerges is very clear. The elements we will discuss below can be 
implemented in many ways, but they’re almost always present in newsletters and 
marketing emails. You may not be legally required to have them all, but each one 
adds to the credibility of your message and the likelihood of it being read. 
Permission Reminder 
There are many different laws that apply to commercial email according to where 
you’re located in the world. One rule that applies almost everywhere is that you 
absolutely must have permission to send people bulk email. In most cases, it also

37
Design for the Inbox 
makes sense to remind people about how they gave you that permission. We’ll be 
covering this topic in more detail in Chapter 5, but we’ll describe it briefly here, as 
it’s an important element that needs to be considered before you start your design. 
It’s common for people to forget that they signed up, especially if you only send 
emails rarely, or they only joined because of a competition or special offer. A short 
message at the top of your email can help people remember, and make them more 
likely to read on. You may have seen some companies attempt this, but make the 
reminder infuriatingly vague, such as “You are receiving this because your address 
was on our list.” Well, duh! 
Recipients want to know why their address is on your list, and how it got there. The 
more specific you can be, the better. In the case of our Modern Henchman newsletter, 
we know that people are on the list for one of three reasons: 
■ They bought products from the website recently. 
■ They filled in the sign-up form on the website. 
■ They are paying subscribers and this is part of their purchase. 
So a simple permission reminder will be something like: “You are receiving this 
because you are a current subscriber, have bought from us (thanks), or signed up 
on our website.” 
Working with your client to write a permission reminder can also be a good way to 
check that the client does have permission to email their list. Seeing the reminder 
written out plainly can trigger them to say, “Oh, we also added our contact list, 
Chamber of Commerce members, and local phone directory.” Uh-oh. 
It’s much better to find out before you send the email that your client has a very 
different understanding of permission than you do (or than your email service 
provider does). You can then work with them to pare the list back to people who 
are more likely to receive it positively, and who meet your email service provider’s 
rules. 
Storing information about how each person signed up (perhaps as a custom data 
field in your list) can make it simple to create personalized permission reminders. 
If you know this person bought from you in May this year, you can remind them of 
that right up front, making them much more likely to respond well to your email.

Panic3 sent a very attractive and cleverly designed email, shown in Figure 3.6, but 
it was the addition of the line “You signed up for our list via [product name]” that 
helped them avoid complaints. 
Figure 3.6. Panic’s permission reminder email is personalized with user-specific information 
Have Recognizable Sender Details 
Studies on email open rates have found that trusting the sender is the single most 
important factor in whether an email is opened or not. That means it’s critical to 
choose an effective and consistent “From” name and email address. You need to 
choose a name or title that will be recognizable to your readers. Often that will be 
the company name, or perhaps the product or service people have signed up to 
learn about. 
Some companies have a well-known leader (bgates@microsoft.com), and if your 
client is among those, you might be able to use their name. Once you’ve picked an

address, it’s important to stick with it, because email clients are less likely to filter 
emails from known senders. Your subscribers may also have manually whitelisted 
your sending address (which you should encourage), and changing the address will 
mean losing any whitelisting benefit. 
Legal Compliance 
Most of this book is about guidelines, suggestions, and general tips, but depending 
on where you and your clients live there may be also legal requirements for any 
commercial email you send. 
The most famous of these laws is of course the dubiously effective CAN-SPAM Act 
(2003), which applies to US senders of “email whose primary purpose is advertising 
or promoting a commercial product or service, including content on a website.” 
Processing emails (such as order confirmations and the like) are mostly exempt. 
The CAN-SPAM law requires that your emails must: 
■  have accurate “From” and “To” addresses, email headers, and routing information 
that identifies the sender 
■  avoid deceptive or misleading subject lines 
■  contain an unsubscribe or opt-out mechanism 
■  identify itself as a commercial email and contain a valid physical address for 
the sender 
The main impact of this law for designers is the need to include the physical address 
in the design, typically in the footer as you’ll have seen. Find out more about CAN­
SPAM at the FTC website.4 
Outside of the USA, there are plenty of similar pieces of legislation, so make certain 
you know what applies to the emails you’re sending. For a head start on finding 
out laws relevant in your area, visit Mark Brownlow’s helpful list.5 
Unsubscribe Link 
Even if there’s no legal requirement to have a method of unsubscribing, it’s usually 
a good idea. Giving subscribers a clear and simple way to say “I would like to stop

receiving your emails now” is the best option for all sides. It helps you as the sender, 
because you avoid the cost of sending an email to a recipient who is only going to 
trash it anyway. And it leaves your subscriber with a positive experience of your 
company or service—you give them control in the relationship. 
When I review email campaigns, I can sense right in the pixels the grudging way 
in which some designers give in to the unsubscribe requirement. They hide it in a 
four-pixel light gray font in the middle of an otherwise unrelated paragraph. It’s 
like playing a particularly frustrating version of “Where’s Waldo,” and if you don’t 
find him this time he’ll knock on your door next week and make you play again. 
There’s really no point to this. If a person doesn’t want to receive your email, they 
will not read it anyway, and by irritating them and making it difficult you’re just 
increasing the risk of them reporting it as spam. So make your unsubscribe method 
loud and proud. You can have a bit of fun with it, though. 
One Campaign Monitor customer ended their email with “Every person who unsub­
scribes makes us cry a tear, but if you must: click here.” Another email for a nightclub 
showed some honesty: “If you signed up while drunk you can unsubscribe here.” 
A person who knows it’s super easy to unsubscribe is far more likely to resubscribe 
later on if they need your information or services again. 
Now that we’ve familiarized ourselves with the design constraints that apply to 
HTML email, and a few key components we’ll be sure to remember, we’re ready to 
begin the actual job of designing the email. But where to start? Fortunately, almost 
all email designs can be based on an existing website design. 
Adapting a Website Design into an Email Design 
The typical email design project will be associated with an existing brand, and 
you’ll almost always have a website design in place from which to work. Making 
your email design feel like it’s from the same company—or website—is extremely 
important. A 2006 survey from Return Path showed that the biggest influence on 
whether emails were opened was “knowing and trusting the sender.”6 If the email 
uses recognizable colors, titles, and imagery, the subject line and preview pane will

Design for the Inbox 
remind the recipients about the sender of the email, providing the confidence to 
act. 
An email that’s visually disconnected from the site it links to will jar, even if it does 
convince some recipients to click a link. 
Don’t go crazy and try to replicate the entire website in an email, though. Your 
design should take the essential feel of the brand (excuse the marketing terms) and 
translate it into what will work for an email. 
Campaign Monitor’s own email newsletter template is one example. Compare the 
current Campaign Monitor home page to the newsletter, both which can be seen in 
Figure 3.7. 
Figure 3.7. Campaign Monitor website and newsletter 
Structurally the email is much simpler, consisting of a single column. The email 
header ties in to the sunburst effect from the website header, but the content has 
been reordered. At a glance the two images look strongly related, but not identical. 
This is the level of similarity to aim for: an email that feels as though it’s a natural 
extension of the website. It should stand on its own as a well-designed and readable 
document, but clearly be part of a bigger design.7

page of the company or sender and compare them. You’ll learn exactly what the 
designer thought were the key elements of the website design and brand by what 
they chose to include, and what was left out. 
Layout Possibilities 
Even in 600 pixels, there are plenty of ways to lay out content. How do designers 
usually approach an email layout? Figure 3.11 shows some the most popular block-
level email layouts, as taken from a typical day of email campaigns sent through 
Campaign Monitor. 
(In truth, these are the most popular layouts once we’ve excluded the common but 
horrifying “jumbled mess of unstructured text and images,” which remains an un­
fortunate favorite with many senders.) 
Two-column layouts (with about an 80/20 split) are by far the most popular layouts, 
which was true for websites ten years ago as well. The idea of interspersing two-
column blocks with full-width blocks is very popular, and gives the email a more 
dynamic feel if it’s done right. It’s also very flexible, and allows you to use a variety 
of different content types.

Figure 3.11. The most popular layout variations sent through Campaign Monitor 
It’s very rare to see more than three columns, and that’s hardly surprising given the 
design constraints I talked about in the section called “The Design Environment for 
Email”. For our example client, you’ll remember we came up with this core content 
list: 
■ Information on the featured product of the day 
■ Featured article (building our reputation for knowledge) 
■ Link to send the email onto a henchmate 
■ Henching tip of the week 
The primary content, then, will be a couple of articles and probably a featured photo. 
This could easily be achieved in several different layouts, so we have some design 
flexibility here. If our articles are more than a paragraph or two, it makes sense to 
give them the biggest chunk of screen space. 
For the first issue, we’ve opted for the layout depicted in Figure 3.12.

46 
I chose this layout as it gives the main content visual weight and room to be easily 
understood, but also has a few obvious spots where we can fit in our other promo­
tions. As a basic template, this will work from month to month without requiring 
a complete redesign. Broad consistency is helpful for your readers to recognize the 
email and grow used to reading it. It also saves time and lets the content creators 
focus on the actual writing and editing, rather than reworking the layout with each 
issue. 
If you have a client that sends several different types of content, you can of course 
create many design variations to suit; you’d still want to make them recognizable 
as being from the same sender and on the same topic, though. 
Remember that the actual content could be shorter than what we were planning on, 
or longer, or more varied month by month. So our design needs to be flexible enough 
to hold together over time. Pixel-perfect design never worked very well on the Web, 
and it certainly won’t work in an email client. 
Some designers like to create a more detailed mockup at this point, slotting content 
sections in wherever they fit. You might find the mockup a useful document to 
show your client before you commit to particular color schemes or layout sizes. 
Designing to Meet Business Goals 
We can adapt the tone and look of our email from existing materials, if any, and 
come up with a practical layout for the content. What we need to do now is work 
out how to put it all together in the most effective way. But what does it mean to 
have an effective email? 
Refer back to Chapter 2, where we completed a client brief for Modern Henchman 
magazine. The brief laid out what our client was expecting to achieve from their 
email newsletter investment. Taking that brief, we suggested a primary goal: generate 
at least $400 in sales directly from newsletter subscribers in the first week after each 
email is sent. 
How can the design of the email help meet that goal? Here’s the five-second test to 
see if an email has a clear goal. Glance at the email for just a moment, and answer 
this question: “What does the designer of this email want me to do first?” 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
47
Design for the Inbox 
You might answer “read this article” or “look at these photos.” More often, though, 
you’d wind up saying “I have no idea.” Let’s start with a fairly obvious example, 
shown in Figure 3.13. 
Figure 3.13. An email with a clear goal 
There’s no guessing required here; the person who sent you this email wants you 
to check out their new studio location. This might seem obvious, but so many emails 
obscure their main goal with huge headers, waffly introductions, and dozens of 
links to less important pages. 
Another example, from the always-discerning 37signals, is shown in Figure 3.14. 
www.ebook777.com

Figure 3.14. 37signals Haystack announcement 
This email is clearly intended to introduce Haystack (since renamed Sortfolio), yet 
there’s no need to read the whole email to find out what Haystack is about. Even if 
you just glance at the email for a few seconds, it has already accomplished its 
primary goal: you’ve been made aware of the new service, and you know what it’s 
all about. That’s good design! 
So, back to Modern Henchman. They want to sell $400 of product as a direct result 
of their email. What does that goal look like in an email? We’re going to have to 
make sure the email lets people know what they can buy, and gives them reasons 
to actually do this. Here are some ideas of how we can go about accomplishing these 
goals: 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
49
Design for the Inbox 
■ Use a promo photo of the products we’d most like to sell. 
■ Use direct language; for example: “Purchase the hat-brim blade today.” 
■ Avoid confusing the message by having too many other links. 
A quick glance at the email should have people saying to themselves, “That looks 
cool, I wonder what it is?” 
In addition to the content, our goal could be addressed right in the subject line. 
Compare these two options: 
■ Modern Henchman newsletter, May 2010 edition 
■ Weapons on sale: Modern Henchman magazine 
The second subject line is far more precise, and the reader knows exactly what to 
expect when they open the email. 
Fortunately, no guessing is required as to which one would perform better. As we 
discussed in Chapter 2, emails are highly measurable. A simple A/B test (where part 
of the subscriber list receives option one; the rest, option two) would quickly show 
which variant resulted in more opens, clicks, or even purchases. 
Before testing, we’ll rely on the briefing and goals to decide which options are most 
likely to be effective. Once the email has been sent, the test results will help to refine 
the design for the next campaign. 
The Modern Henchman Newsletter Design 
Finally, it’s time for the design work. For some people, this is the point to fire up 
their copy of Photoshop or Fireworks. Others prefer to start with pen and paper, a 
whiteboard, or charcoal and a convenient cave wall. Whatever works for you is fine. 
For the Modern Henchman magazine newsletter, we have taken the layout we put 
together above and inserted some photography from the website. We’ve also chosen 
fonts and colors that match those on the website. We had the writers from the 
website provide us with the content that will be going into the first issue, so we 
have some subject matter to design around.

Of course, that’s just one example of an HTML email. And while it accomplishes 
the client’s goals admirably, it might not be the sort of design best suited to your 
particular project. So, to help get your creative juices flowing, the next section is a 
gallery of some of my favorite HTML email newsletters from which you can draw 
inspiration.

Typography 
Although fonts based on Flash and JavaScript are unavailable in email clients, and 
as we’ve mentioned it’s best not to rely on images for your content, it’s still possible 
to produce beautiful typography in an email. 
For a fantastic example, take a look at Figure 3.22, from cabedge.com.13 Using just 
a few fonts in varied sizes and colors, combined with a clever idea, the email really 
catches your interest and relays its message.

Even though the email in Figure 3.24 consists mostly of a large image file, it makes 
the image subservient to the primary content. We talked about using typographic 
characters as design elements in plain text emails, but Reconsider Design15 provide 
an excellent example of how this technique can be applied equally well to HTML 
emails: the two slash characters (//) that precede each heading provide a strong 
visual cue, tying the design together. Even better, they work independently of images 
being enabled.

Although most of this book is focused around regular email newsletters, there are 
plenty of other uses for HTML email. Have a look at these standout examples. Unlike 
newsletters, these special-purpose emails have even greater freedom to center on a 
single key message or idea. 
Figure 3.25 shows a great example of an invitation email. All the key information 
is presented in a single column, with an interesting theme tying the design together.

The reminder email from DHL Express16 shown in Figure 3.27 has a lot of positive 
features: it uses an image as a supporting element rather than for core content; it 
has a clearly stated, personal message; and it has an obvious call to action.

Almost Image Free  
Just because you use HTML doesn’t mean you have to use lots of images. These 
emails employ striking design without relying on images being downloaded. 
This example in Figure 3.28, an invitation to attend an organizational meeting by 
the Greater Houston Partnership,17 consists almost exclusively of blocks of text. Yet 
it uses the features of HTML to make that text clear and readable, conveying its 
message as simply and directly as possible.

The product announcement email from Huge Paper18 in Figure 3.29 makes excellent 
use of a simple color scheme. By combining this with a clear layout and plenty of 
whitespace, it’s a strong design without relying on images.

Sign up for as many newsletters as you can (use a folder or special email address 
so that you can easily separate them from your regular email). Reading the actual 
emails in your own inbox is a different experience than seeing a screenshot in a 
gallery, so I highly recommend it as a way to immerse yourself in the design language 
of HTML email. 
Even so, there are a few great collections of email designs that are well worth

Coding Your Emails 
With a well-thought-out content and design plan in place, it’s time to dirty our 
hands with HTML and CSS. By the end of this chapter we’ll have produced a solid 
email template that works in all the major email clients. 
What’s so hard about HTML emails? 
You’ve built a ton of websites, you can write HTML and CSS in your sleep, and you 
have a big poster on your wall of Jeffrey Zeldman.1 So how hard can it be to build 
an HTML email? Well, it’s harder than you might think. 
In the broader web design world, we’ve been through the browser wars where 
Netscape and Internet Explorer fought each other to introduce competing ways to 
code just about everything. Thanks to the Web Standards Project and associated 
efforts, modern web browsers are much more consistent than they were ten years 
ago. 
1 For the uninitiated, Jeffrey Zeldman is one of the co-founders of the Web Standards Project, and also 
of the influential online publication A List Apart [http://alistapart.com].

Unfortunately, while that war was being fought, email clients like Outlook and Lotus 
Notes were apparently off hiding in the marketing department behind a very expens­
ive beanbag chair, and were left behind. 
Even worse than not trying to improve their HTML and CSS rendering, some email 
clients have actually gone backwards. Three years ago, Microsoft decided Outlook 
2007 would stop using Internet Explorer to render HTML emails. Before you get all 
excited, they were replacing it with Microsoft Word. Yes, that Microsoft Word, the 
word processor. In one version, Outlook went from being decent and understandable 
to downright terrible at displaying HTML emails from anyone except other Outlook 
users. 
Outlook 2007 is a hugely popular email client, but that’s not the only problem: 
building HTML for email means you’re dealing with more than four or five major 
web browsers, and 12 to 15 different email clients, each with solid market share. 
Some of them are great, like Apple Mail. A design that works in Safari will be perfect 
in Apple Mail. Some, like Outlook, are horrible and will cause dizziness, hair loss, 
and heart palpitations. In between are a whole slew of different rendering constraints, 
quirks, and inconsistencies. 
So there’s a challenge for web designers. How do you take your 2010 web design 
skills and apply them to email clients with last millennium’s capabilities? Don't 
despair, because it’s possible to succeed with a little bit of knowledge and willingness 
to test. You might even save your hairline. 
Guidelines for a Solid HTML Email Template 
If you’ve been building websites for long enough to remember the glory days of 
GeoCities and Angelfire, you probably built your first websites using tables for 
layout. Building an HTML email today will take you back to those heady times, al­
though with rather less use of the <hr> tag. 
Go ahead and stick a bookmark in this section, because you’ll want to come back 
to it every time you start building a new email template. I’ll cover the tips and tricks 
that make it possible to attain good results for as many of your—or your clients’—read­
ers as possible.

Coding Your Emails 
Know Your Audience  
The first step in building a successful HTML email is to know how it will be read. 
If the subscribers are all going to be reading your email on their company-provided 
BlackBerry devices, you might decide to use plain text, for example. In most cases 
there’ll be a mix of email clients in use, but there are a few ways to find out. Cam­
paign Monitor publishes some overall statistics for email client usage2 that give a 
broad overview, albeit with some limitations. 
There’s no guarantee that these reflect your audience, though. A tool like Fingerprint3 
can give you a better idea of what your readers are actually using. Some email service 
providers will give you a report for each campaign, listing the email client for each 
subscriber where available. 
What you’re looking for in these reports is your lowest common denominator. If 
there’s 30% using Lotus Notes 7, for example, you’ll need to make sure you specific­
ally test in that client before sending. A particular version of an email client might 
be relevant—Outlook 2003 will cause you far fewer headaches than Outlook 2007, 
and in some cases your list might only use one version. 
If you’ve never sent to this list before, you might just have to test in every client 
you can find, and make some educated guesses about the kind of audience with 
which you’re dealing. Are they likely to be using mobile phones to read email, or 
locked-down corporate servers? 
Maybe they’re all individuals using Hotmail and Yahoo addresses, which are at 
least easy to test in. Whatever you know about your audience, make yourself some 
notes about what email clients you most want to check every time you send. 
Tables: Not Just for Data 
The single most important guideline for HTML emails is that CSS layout just doesn’t 
work. The major email clients either offer no support at all, or mangle it in myriad 
frustratingly different ways.

Using CSS instead of tables was the battle cry of the web standards war, but coding 
HTML emails means raising the white flag and giving in. Unless you’re building an 
extremely simple email, or your whole audience is using a more modern email 
reading tool, it’s back to those all encompassing <table> tags. 
Gmail, Outlook 2007, Lotus Notes, and no doubt many more all have big issues with 
floated elements, and are even wildly unreliable with margins and padding. You’ll 
want to set up some structural HTML tables to make sure you end up with an email 
that at least holds together well. 
There are some problems using tables, too, as learned the hard way by many design­
ers. Here are a few tips for dealing with them: 
Set Widths in Each Cell Rather than on the Table 
The combination of widths on the table, widths on the cells, HTML margins 
and padding, and CSS margins and padding can be chaotic. Simplify your code, 
and your life, by setting only on each cell: 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> 
 <tr> 
 <td width="150"></td> 
 <td width="350"></td> 
 </tr>  
</table>  
Email clients are unreliable when it comes to deducing the correct width of a 
cell, so it’s safest to explicitly set one. Pixel widths are the most reliable, as using 
percentages can give you some wacky results, especially when using nested 
tables. 
To set your cell padding, either set it once on the whole table with the 
cellpadding parameter, or use CSS to set padding in individual cells. Mixing 
the two is likely to cause problems, and is best avoided. 
Nest Tables for Consistent Spacing 
Even when margins and padding are supported by most email clients, results 
will be inconsistent. If the spacing is critical to you, try nesting tables inside 
your main table instead. Old school!

Coding Your Emails 
Set a Background Color on a Container Table 
Some email clients will ignore a background on the <body> tag, or one that’s 
set in your style sheet. Having a wrapping table around all your content and 
setting a bgcolor attribute on it will work around this issue. 
Whitespace Does Matter 
Theoretically, whitespace in HTML files should be ignored, but in practice it 
can cause all sorts of rendering quirks—especially if you have whitespace 
between table cells. Make a habit of removing any spaces between the closing 
tag of one cell and the opening tag of the next to avoid unsightly gaps and layout 
problems. 
Use Inline CSS 
This is where the C for Cascading in CSS comes in handy. Applying a style inline 
gives it priority over styles further away (such as webmail client styles), and also 
works around the email clients that strip out CSS from the head or external CSS 
files. 
Here’s a quick refresher in case you’ve not used inline CSS for a while (or ever, if 
you started web design after 2000). 
A style applied to p elements in a separate style sheet or in the head of your HTML 
page might look like this: 
p { 
 line-height: 1.5em; 
 margin: 0px 0px 10px 0px;  
}  
These styles will apply to all paragraphs in your page, but if the style is stripped 
out (as Gmail will do), the paragraphs will be styled according to whatever default 
the email client uses, or the webmail client’s own style sheet. 
Applying the style inline means styling each individual p element throughout your 
content: 
<p style="line-height:1.5em;margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;">Lorem … </p>

74 
You’ll achieve more consistent results if you apply styles in this way for all the 
relevant elements in your HTML email. 
When you start doing this, you’ll quickly realize that it’s tiresome work repeating 
the same styles over and over in your HTML (a lot like <font> tags used to be). 
Lucky for us, there are a few ways to save time: 
■  Don’t inline your styles until you’ve finished the coding—develop it all using a 
<style> tag in your head, and only once you’ve made all the changes do you 
apply them inline. This saves having to go back and edit 20 instances of the 
same style. 
■  Use an email service or tool that will automatically inline your CSS for you. 
Campaign Monitor, for example, will optionally take styles from the head or 
from an external file and automatically apply each style to the appropriate ele­
ments inline when you import your campaign. 
There are several tools that will take an HTML page and style sheet, and then spit 
out your page with the CSS all inlined. My favorite is Premailer,4 which will also 
give you useful advice about unsupported CSS. 
There are certain styles that perform poorly inline—you’re unable to specify :hover 
states for links, for example. It’s generally worth keeping the styles in the head as 
well as inline—the extra download size is outweighed by the benefit of covering 
all your bases. 
Avoid Relying on Images 
We already touched on this in the section called “Image Blocking” in Chapter 3, 
but it’s worth revisiting. 
Do you remember the web designer term “slicing”? When websites used to be con­
structed by designing a page-sized image and cutting it into little sections, which 
were then reassembled into tables and stuck on a page? 
That used to be a very common technique for working around browser inconsisten­
cies. Sadly, the same technique lives on in many email designers’ toolboxes, and

Coding Your Emails 
even the biggest companies send out HTML emails that are nothing more than a 
collection of images. 
While it certainly reduces the time spent developing the email, the benefits end 
there. Unlike web browsers, email clients routinely block images from downloading 
until the reader clicks a special button or link, as shown in Figure 4.1. 
Figure 4.1. Image of a “display images in this email” link 
Research over the last few years has shown that a significant percentage (some es­
timate up to 40%) of email recipients never enable images at all. Add to that all the 
people who fail to realize they could show images, and you have a huge chunk of 
recipients who will not see your logo, product photo, or animated mailbox. 
The default image blocking settings for various email clients are shown in Table 4.1 
(you can find an up-to-date version of this table online).5 I’ll be explaining what 
the last column (trusted sender) means very shortly. For now, just pay attention to 
the second column: it shows whether images are displayed or not by default in each 
of the clients.

Unless you know for sure that your audience is only reading email in Apple Mail, 
for example, you need to assume that a decent number of people will not see your 
images (since a number of popular clients, including Gmail, Windows Live, and 
Outlook 2003 and 2007 block images by default). So that beautiful sales newsletter, 
which is supposed to appear as seen in Figure 4.2, will actually look as shown in 
Figure 4.3.

78 
Become a Known Sender 
Most email clients allow recipients to automatically display images when a message 
is from a known sender (senders appearing in whitelists, contact lists, or address 
books). The final column in Table 4.1 shows which clients will allow recipients to 
override their image blocking setting for trusted senders. 
You’ll want to encourage your subscribers to add the “From” address you use to 
their whitelist. You can have a note right on your sign-up form that asks them to 
do this, so that the first email they receive will display images. And if you choose 
to send one, you can also include a more in-depth note in the confirmation email 
that’s sent when people join your list. 
In your actual email campaigns you can do the same. To be more helpful, put a page 
on your site with instructions for how to add an address to the whitelist for different 
email clients, and link to it.6 
Living without Images 
There will always be people who by choice or chance never enable images for your 
campaigns, so the design needs to take that into account. Follow a few simple 
guidelines to improve your results: 
Don’t use an image as the first item in your email 
Remember that many email programs will use a small preview window, and if 
the only element that fits there is an undisplayed image, the email might as well 
be blank. Start with some useful HTML text content that lets your readers know 
what they’re going to receive. It might give them a reason to bother downloading 
the images. 
Use alt attributes 
Just like you do for a website, make sure to have useful alt attributes for each 
image. In some cases, they will show up when the image is blocked, and can 
provide a good backup. Unfortunately they won’t always be displayed, or be 
displayed in full. Check Table 4.2 to see how common email clients will handle 
alt attributes.

Use captions for important images 
If you have an image that contains important content (as opposed to being a 
decorative element), use a text caption to describe it. That way, even if the image 
is not displayed readers will have access to the email’s full content. This is more 
reliable than alt attributes; as we’ve seen, alt attribute rendering is highly 
variable between email clients. 
Always have text and images 
If you have a balance of HTML text and some images, then the email is useful 
even without images. If the email entirely consists of images that are blocked, 
the email is a waste of time. 
Consider whether you need images at all 
Sometimes imagery is essential. For a great example, see the FontShop newslet­
ter, which displays samples of new fonts.7 Without the images, it’s a lot less 
7 http://www.fontshop.com/ 
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Create Stunning HTML Email That Just Works! 
80 
useful, so they’re definitely worth including. The FontShop audience is also 
more likely to be displaying images at all times. 
For some cases, though, imagery is unnecessary. Consider a transactional email 
like an order confirmation. It needs to be clear and able to be scanned, but images 
aren’t going to contain vital content. So you may choose to spend your time on 
typography, formatting, and fine-tuning the content. 
Use a recognizable logo for those who’ll be able to see it, but avoid relying on 
the images to make your point for you. Ensure that part of your campaign 
sending process is viewing the email without any images loaded, the way a lot 
of your recipients will be seeing it. 
Dissuade clients who want all-image emails 
Web designers often tell me that they personally know better than to send purely 
image emails, but their clients want everything to look perfect. Here’s the 
point—it’s our job as designers to show our clients why that is such a bad idea. 
Sit them down and show them what their email will look like without images. 
Ask them, “Would you click through on this blank page?” 
Remind them that perhaps 30% of people will be seeing exactly that, which 
could equate to hundreds or thousands of people who might hit Delete and 
never bother loading those images. This is a case where we need to give clients 
what they actually need, rather than what they think they want. 
Another Reason to Avoid All-image Emails 
Spam filters often use the ratio of images versus text as a flag to gauge whether 
an email is legitimate. All-image emails are more likely to be marked as spam than 
mixed content emails. 
Other Guidelines 
These are the most important guidelines for a reliable HTML email template, but 
there are other relevant odds and ends that are necessary to keep in mind: 

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
81 
Coding Your Emails 
■  Store the email images on a web server—preferably in a folder that’s separate 
from your website’s images (for example, in a folder called /images/email), and 
don’t delete them. Some people open emails weeks or months later, the same 
way people use bookmarks to return to websites. 
■  Use the target="_blank" attribute for your <a> tags, so that people who read 
with webmail services don’t have the requested page appear within their webmail 
interface. 
CSS Support in Email Clients 
There are some designers who will tell you that you have to use <font> tags because 
CSS never works in email clients. That’s just not the case, and there’s a significant 
body of tests that confirm it. 
You can safely leave the <font> tags in the bottom drawer with your Pogs and 
Tamagotchis, but there are a lot of cases where you can’t use modern CSS techniques. 
Table 4.4 through to Table 4.10 on the following pages show which of the most 
common CSS selectors and properties are supported, and which are not, across 
popular desktop, mobile, and web email clients. 
You’ll notice that support for many properties you take for granted when developing 
web pages is inconsistent. Lest you think you can safely write off any of these clients, 
Table 4.3 shows their current estimated market shares.

Coding Your Emails 
You’ll want to refer to these tables when building templates, as a quick way of seeing 
which selectors and properties are safe to work with, and which ones you need to 
watch. Even trickier, you’ll see inconsistent support for some elements, which will 
work in certain combinations but not in others, so what works in one email might 
fail in another. 
There’s no avoiding the testing process, but the CSS support charts will cut out a 
lot of the frustration for you. Once you’ve built a few templates, you’ll start to know 
from memory the quickest way to achieve a solid result. 
Webmail clients can be a special case when it comes to HTML email rendering. For 
example, Gmail comes in at least two different versions, and in Campaign Monitor’s 
testing we’ve seen variations in how the same email appears depending on which 
version you’re working in. It also strips all CSS in your document’s head (whether 
in a style element or a separate style sheet referred to in a link), and is the main 
reason I recommend applying all your styles inline. 
What Other Technologies Can You Use in 
HTML Email? 
The modern Web contains a lot more than HTML, CSS, and images. JavaScript, 
audio, Flash, video, animations, and forms are all part of a designer’s toolkit. Which 
of these work in email clients? This section outlines the current state of play. 
What Technologies Should You Use? 
Even if you can use a certain technique or medium, you might not want to. People 
go to your website by choice, typically: they go when they want to and with an 
understanding of what to expect. An email is an entirely different environment from 
a website (as discussed in the section called “The Design Environment for Email” 
in Chapter 3), and having sound or video playing inside an email is more likely to 
irritate than entertain. 
For some emails and some subscribers it might be okay, but be very cautious about 
disrupting your readers’ expectations.

Scripting in Emails 
The short answer is that scripting is unsupported in emails. This is hardly surprising, 
given the obvious security risks involved with a script running inside an application 
that has all that personal information stored in it. 
Webmail clients are mostly running the interface in JavaScript and are not keen on 
your email interfering with that, and desktop client filters often consider JavaScript 
to be an indicator of spam or phishing emails. 
Even in the cases where it might run, there really is little benefit to scripting in 
emails. Keep your emails as straight HTML and CSS, and avoid the hassle. 
Flash 
In the web browser market, Adobe Flash is almost ubiquitous (except on iPhones 
and iPads, of course), but in the email client world Flash is barely existent. In most 
cases it’s completely absent, and even the fallback image you can select won’t show 
up. 
The details of the current level of Flash support are shown in Table 4.11.9

the testing was done.

Using Flash in your emails should be avoided for the present, as it just doesn’t work. 
Unsurprisingly, this has a considerable influence on the effectiveness of video in 
email, which is our next topic. 
Video 
Video can be a very persuasive medium—presenting action rather than just showing 
a static photo or text description. Whether people actually want to be watching a 
video in their email rather than on a website is an open question. 
As of 2010, there are a lot of different ways that video theoretically could be included 
in an email message, but in practice most of them won’t work for the majority of 
recipients. Campaign Monitor has tested the following techniques and formats for 
live video in an email: Flash, QuickTime, Windows Media, animated GIFs (streamed 
and embedded), Java Applets, embedded MPEGs, and streamed HTML5 video.

As you can see, animated GIFs do have solid support, although they’re still subject 
to image blocking just like static images. In addition, Outlook 2007 will only show 
the first frame of the animation. 
Personally I recommend a still simpler approach: take a screengrab of your video 
with the player chrome (and ideally a big honking “play” button), and put that into 
your email. Make it a link to view the video on your website (and link up a caption 
underneath it too). It’s one additional click, but it’s guaranteed to work for everyone. 
Forms 
Having an email contain a live form is a great idea—it’s easy for your readers to fill 
in some details and RSVP, or answer a survey. Unfortunately, the support for forms 
in email clients is quite inconsistent. Some clients will put up scary-looking security 
warnings when the reader tries to use a form, and others will just disable the form 
so it’s unable to be sent. 
A lot of people might be able to use a form, but the rest will see a form that does 
nothing at all, which is a fairly bad experience. Again, the recommended approach 
is to link to a form on your website, where you know it will work. 
The level of form support in common clients is shown in Table 4.13.

Testing 
If you learn just one lesson from this book (I’m aiming for at least three), let it be 
this: always, always, always test your emails before you send them out. 
There is no worse feeling in the world than hitting that Send button, and then 
spotting a typo in the very first heading. Well, okay, there are some worse feelings 
than that. Actually, heaps of them. Still, you take my point. 
At Campaign Monitor, we once instructed 70,000+ subscribers to “ass your content” 
instead of “add your content,” which generated quite a few replies, as you might 
imagine. Luckily, most people are understanding, but that’s not always the case.

Coding Your Emails 
Once an email has been sent out, it’s impossible to take it back. A website can be 
updated in a moment, but emails live out their separate lives in a million different 
inboxes, beyond reach. 
There are quite a few methods and elements to test. Obviously, you’ll have all the 
copy spell-checked, sanity-checked, and rechecked by a person other than you. 
When it comes to the design and build, testing can be a bit time-consuming. There 
are so many different email clients to look at, versions of those clients, and platform 
differences that it can be overwhelming. 
Fortunately, there are a few great services around that take a lot of the pain out of 
checking your email in multiple email clients: 
■ Litmus email testing10 
■ Campaign Monitor design and spam testing11 
■ MailChimp’s Inbox Inspector12 
Each service will take your HTML email and give you back a series of screenshots 
showing how your email renders in a number of different email clients. You can 
typically scroll through the whole email, see it with images blocked or images 
loaded, and gain a fairly good idea if there is a problem you need to fix. 
Given more time and access to all the many email clients already set up, it would 
be better to physically interact with each one, but in practice these testing services 
are a huge time saver and well worth the cost. 
In the quite likely case that something is not working right (content being cut off or 
displayed in the wrong place, or any number of quirky behaviors), the troubleshoot­
ing process begins. If you’re lucky, the problem client will be one like Gmail or 
Outlook that’s easy to get your hands on. 
Then you can tweak and test a few times to make it work again, and perhaps run 
another full design test to make sure nothing else broke during the fixes.

Sometimes it will be a more difficult client, such as a particular version of Lotus 
Notes. These can be tough to troubleshoot, and you might need the help of a reader 
or colleague who can run some tests for you. 
This process can be quite a long one, but once you have a robust template in place 
it will be reused over and over for future campaigns, and can often be adapted to 
suit multiple designs. So the time will be well spent. 
Building the Modern Henchman Newsletter 
In the final part of this chapter we’ll look at the code required for the Modern 
Henchman newsletter, which has been developed and tested according to the 
guidelines we’ve covered. 
You can download this template for free with the code archive for this book13 and 
use it as a base for your own designs, if you like. 
For our client, the Modern Henchman magazine, we’re trying to create a solid tem­
plate that will be reused each month without requiring stacks of extra time in design 
or testing. So we need to develop an email that has a structure that can handle longer 
or shorter content without breaking apart. 
Figure 4.4 shows a reminder of what we want the final product to look like.

Building the Framework 
Beginning from the top, we have an introductory section that should show in the 
preview pane for most readers. It will contain a simplified list of contents for the 
email and a reminder of why people are receiving the newsletter. 
Even with images turned off, that text will be visible, and it’s a great opportunity 
to convince people to read on. We’ll also put an unsubscribe link right up top, for 
those who are no longer interested. As we’ve discussed, it’s much better to let them 
unsubscribe easily than to force them to mark it as spam. 
Below the introduction is the masthead, which is 580 pixels wide. That’s narrow 
enough to be readable without horizontal scrolling for most email clients. Obviously 
some mobile readers will struggle, but since our main goal is to promote the product 
of the month, and we want to use a big photo, we can’t go too much smaller. 
When you’re designing for your own client, you may be able to use a flexible column 
width, but remember to consider your goals and prepare to accommodate different 
content. 
The layout for the body content is fairly simple—essentially a two-column structure, 
but with a least one section that spans across the full width for the product promo. 
We already know that CSS floats won’t work, so to build this layout we’re going to 
use tables to hold the content. To ensure that we can put a background color and 
image (at least for some email clients) in place, we start with a 100% width container 
table: 
modern_henchman_template.html (excerpt) 
<table width="100%" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0">  
</table>

Coding Your Emails 
Whitespace 
I mentioned earlier that several email clients can be sensitive to whitespace in 
your HTML. In the examples that follow, I’ve laid out the markup for maximum 
readability, and it still works well in the clients I’ve tested. However, this can be 
unreliable, so if you are adapting this template and run into any weird spacing 
issues, you should try removing the whitespace to see if that helps. 
Inside that is our main content container with a fixed width of 580 pixels: 
modern_henchman_template.html (excerpt) 
<table class="main" width="580" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"  
➥border="0"> 
You’ll notice that we’re using HTML attributes rather than CSS here for the best 
results. Nesting tables gives a more reliable layout than we could otherwise achieve, 
especially with email clients like Outlook and Lotus Notes. 
When you’re building your own templates, it’s a good idea to test in Outlook 2007 
(if you can) and Gmail as you progress, so that you find any major layout problems 
early—these two clients are both common and frequent causes of problems. 
Fill the table cells with a block color and add some CSS borders so you can see how 
the layout is holding together as you work on it. 
Adding the Content 
Handling the full-width masthead and introduction section is straightforward—they 
can be added as simple full-width rows to the content table:

Below that, the two-column layout begins. This looks like a job for yet another table. 
Nesting another table lets us create consistent padding and margins around the body

 <td align="center" class="dotsHoriz"> 
 <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

 <p>Read more link</p></td> 
 <td width="15" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p>  
</td> 
 </tr> 
 </table> 
 </td>  
</tr>  
This looks more complicated than it is. We create the two columns, again setting 
explicit widths. As I’ve mentioned before, letting the email clients try to work out 
how wide an element should be is never a good idea, as the results will vary widely.

The secret to this so-called “two-column” layout is actually more columns, hiding 
around both sides of the content to create the gutter and margins. 
Figure 4.5 shows the content block with borders turned on. I have used the Web 
Developer Toolbar14 extension for Firefox to display a border around all table cells, 
which makes it easier to understand what’s going on. If you’ve never worked with 
table-based layouts before, or have banished them from your mind, this extension 
can help you make sense of them as you develop your email templates. 
Figure 4.5. The content block with table cells outlined 
As you can see, we’re using a total of six columns for our two-column layout. I 
know, it’s ugly and old-school, and makes you feel a little bit ill just to look at it. 
We all feel that way the first time we go back to table layouts. 
The nausea will pass eventually, and you’ll be left with a two-column layout that 
displays reliably in all the major email clients. The code for the full-width content

block is very similar, except that it uses only three columns: one for each gutter and 
one for the content area. 
When you need to split a content area further, all you need to do is nest another 
table. In our example, the “Send to a friend” and “Unsubscribe” blocks at the bottom 
of the email require nesting another one-column table, like this: 
modern_henchman_template.html (excerpt) 
<td class="sidebar" align="left" bgcolor="#ffffff"  
valign="top" width="190"> 
 <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

 <tr> 
 <td align="left" bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> 
 <h3><img src="images/unsubscribe.gif" alt="" align="left"

Coding Your Emails 
How Low Will You Go? 
In building any HTML email template, you’ll reach a decision point. Given that the 
columns are in place, and will hold together well for almost everyone, we could 
stop pandering to email clients at this point. 
If you and your client are okay with some minor visual variation between email 
clients, you could revert to more modern techniques for the actual content. Just fill 
in the headings and paragraphs, style them in your CSS, and let them be rendered 
according to the email client’s own quirks. 
Most of the time your readers are not going to be comparing the email in different 
programs, so unless something is really broken they’ll be oblivious to minor differ­
ences. This is what I’d suggest most of the time, although of course there’s still 
plenty of testing to be done. 
If your client is more demanding, or the design really needs to be consistent, you 
can continue on with further nested tables for individual content chunks. That way 
you’ll have a lot more control over spacing around headings, for example, and 
control over consistency to let you line up elements with each other. 
Here’s an example of the effort required to create a consistent heading block: 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" bgcolor="#000000"> 
 <tbody> 
 <tr> 
 <td> 
 <h2>The actual heading</h2> 
 </td> 
 </tr> 
 </tbody>  
</table>  
This is all the code required just to make sure that the <h2> is displayed at the same 
size, and with the same surrounding space across the big email clients. 
Think carefully before you go to these lengths, because it may well be a waste of 
your time. It’s still good to know that it can be done.

Figure 4.8. Screenshots in Outlook 2007 (left), Thunderbird (center), and Lotus Notes 6.5 (right) 
It might be difficult to make out in the screenshots, but there’s still some variation 
from client to client. What you can see is that the overall design is quite close, and 
certainly doesn’t look broken in any of these clients (even though one of the images 
has failed to load in Lotus Notes 6.5). 
The lesson you take away from this should be that you don’t need to use only images 
to achieve consistent results with HTML email. Coding your emails the way I’ve 
outlined might require a bit more effort up front, but they will be more effective, so 
you’ll reap rewards in the long run.

More Resources for Building Email 
Templates 
The Web is chock-full of design galleries, and CSS galleries seem to be sprouting 
up like mushrooms in every corner of it, but there are relatively few HTML email 
template galleries. 
Keep these sites bookmarked for the next design you need to code up, because you 
can save a ton of time: 
■ free templates from Campaign Monitor15 
■ ThemeForest templates16 
■ free templates from MailChimp17 
There’s no shame in taking a template that’s freely available and has been tested, 
and adapting it to your needs. 
Your client has no interest in paying you to fight a battle to the death with Lotus 
Notes 7; they just want an email that people can read and that achieves their goals. 
Over time you’ll build up your own knowledge and a set of working code that you 
can reuse, which will save you time that’s better spent on the design and business 
goals. 
In Chapter 5, we’ll step back from the code and take a look at email permission, and 
our responsibilities as designers.

Chapter5 
Understanding Permission 
So far we have focused solely on creating HTML emails. By now you have all the 
information you need to be able to think through a design and then build it into a 
working template. 
In this chapter we will be taking a broader look at the business side of commercial 
email, to understand what should and should not be sent, and who should be re­
ceiving it. 
Why Designers Should Care about 
Permission 
You might think that managing permission is outside your job description, that you 
can just do the design and hand it over to your client. In some situations, that may 
well be true. But even so, there’s a huge need for designers to understand the legal, 
practical, and ethical issues around email marketing. 
Why should you care? Pragmatically, if you offer email newsletters as a service to 
your clients or your employer, you should be able to explain the laws, limits, and

best practices of the industry. It will prevent them from running into problems, 
thereby making your advice and services more valuable. 
On a personal level, we should all care about permission because we all receive 
commercial emails, and not always by choice. Too many people send unwanted 
email with the help of designers who never bothered to check who the subscribers 
were going to be. 
Finally, you need to know about permission so that you stay on the right side of 
the law and avoid any legal problems. So, now that I’ve convinced you of the need 
to care about permission, let’s ask an even more fundamental question: what is 
permission anyway? 
Spam: It’s Not Just Viagra 
My first rule of spam is that any email that contains the phrase “this is not spam” 
is almost always spam. My second rule of spam is that nobody thinks that what 
they’re sending is spam. 
Of course, this is a massive oversimplification. Obviously some people really are 
unrepentant spammers who know exactly what they’re doing, but many more senders 
are convinced that what they’re doing is not spam, while their recipients think 
otherwise. 
As designers, we obviously need to avoid sending emails that are considered spam 
by the law. But it’s an often-ignored fact that we should also avoid sending emails 
that are perceived as spam. We’ll look into that in a moment, but first we’ll start 
with the broadest and most widely accepted definitions of what constitutes spam: 
the legal definitions. In fact, there’s a whole slew of legal definitions, depending 
on where you’re based. The most well-known of these laws, which we touched on 
in the section called “Legal Compliance” in Chapter 3, is the US CAN-SPAM Act. 
Spam According to the Law 
If you’re sending email as a US company (or for a US company), you’re legally bound 
to comply with the CAN-SPAM laws. For the full details on your obligations, see 
http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/ecommerce/bus61.shtm.

Understanding Permission 
Here are the core requirements, directly from the Federal Trade Commission, the 
principal US consumer protection agency: 
Don’t use false or misleading header information 
The From, Reply To, and other address details should all be valid and accurate 
for the sender and recipient. 
Don’t use deceptive subject lines 
The subject line should accurately reflect the content of the email. 
Identify the message as an advertisement 
Don’t try to disguise it as a personal email, for example. This law indicates why 
you sometimes see [ADV] in subject lines. 
Tell recipients where you’re located 
Include a valid, physical postal address for the sender. 
Provide a way to opt out 
You must include a clear, prominent way to opt out of future email (which can 
be automated or manual). 
Honor opt-out requests promptly 
You must give people a way to opt out that’s available for at least 30 days after 
you send them the email, and you must act on a request to opt out within ten 
business days, for free. An online opt-out must only require sending a single 
email, or visiting a single page. 
Clients are unable give us as designers the sole legal burden of complying with these 
laws; instead, we’re jointly responsible for meeting them. 
These are the guidelines as of February 2010, but keep in mind that the FTC has 
made additional rulings since first issuing the laws, so you need to keep an eye out 
for any future updates. 
Many countries have published their own laws regarding spam and commercial 
email.1

Wherever you live, you need to know the legal issues for you and your clients or 
company. However, complying with the law is just part of the equation; there are 
other issues with which to contend. 
Permission versus Spam 
What the law considers to be spam is often quite distinct (and much narrower) than 
what the typical email reader considers spam. As a consequence, what an ISP or 
an email service provider considers spam will often include a lot more than what 
the laws cover. 
Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson of the opinionated web application firm 
37signals make this point in Rework (New York: Crown Business, 2010): 
Spam is a way of thinking. It’s an impersonal, imprecise, inexact 
approach. You’re merely throwing something against the wall to 
see if it sticks. You’re harassing thousands of people hoping that a 
couple will respond. Press releases are spam. Each one is a generic 
pitch for coverage sent out to hundreds of journalists you don’t 
know hoping that one will write about you. Resumés are spam when 
someone shotguns out hundreds at a time to potential employers. 
They don’t care about landing your job, they just care about landing 
any job. Spam is basically a half-ass way of getting someone’s atten­
tion. It’s insulting, really. 
Legally speaking, press releases and resumés are not spam, but the authors of the 
book consider those kinds of email to be just as spammy as Viagra or mail-order 
bridal offers. This is a redefinition of spam to extend beyond emails I didn’t ask for 
to also include emails that are irrelevant or worthless. 
A 2008 survey by Q Interactive and MarketingSherpa2 has confirmed that this is a 
growing definition for individuals as well:

Understanding Permission 
Underscoring consumers’ varying definitions of spam, respondents 
cited a variety of non-permission-based reasons for hitting the spam 
button, including “the email was not of interest to me” (41 percent), 
“I receive too much email from the sender” (25 percent), and “I re­
ceive too much email from all senders” (20 percent). 
From an email sender’s perspective, this can seem unfair. You gather permission 
according to all the relevant laws, but are still labeled a spammer. Features like the 
Hotmail unsubscribe button can make it easier for people to achieve the result they 
want (less email) without having to accuse a sender of spamming; until this type 
of feature becomes more common, though, the spam button will continue to serve 
as a proxy for “I don’t want your emails.” 
Email providers and ISPs have publicly admitted to using the same kind of judgment 
in deciding what counts as email abuse: 
Operationally, we define spam as whatever consumers don’t want 
in their inbox. 
—Yahoo Mail (Miles Libbey, anti-spam product manager) 
I don’t care if they’ve triple opted-in and [given] you their credit 
card number … relevance rules, and catering to end user preferences 
is top priority. 
—AOL (Charles Stiles, AOL Postmaster) 
We need to think really a step beyond opt-in and focus on the con­
sumer’s expectations, relevancy, and frequency. 
—Microsoft/Hotmail (Craig Spiezle, online safety evangelist) 
Sometimes people are afraid to report a message because they aren’t 
sure if it is “really” spam or not. Our opinion is that if you didn’t 
ask for it and you don’t want it, it’s spam to you, and it should be 
reported. 
—Gmail (Brad Taylor, Google engineer)

The Rise of Relevance  
You need more than just permission; you also need to put yourself in your sub­
scribers’ shoes. They signed up for information about one of your products, but 
does that mean they want to be emailed about your other products? Not necessarily. 
You’ve worked with your client or team to determine that you can legally send to 
subscribers, but there’s still work to do. Now you’re into the gray area of interest, 
relevance, and potentially “stale” permission. 
There’s no way to guarantee that someone, somewhere won’t consider any particular 
email to be spam. In fact, those in the tech industry are the most likely to make 
blanket statements about all marketing emails being spam, or even all HTML emails. 
It’s just impossible to make everyone happy, especially those who somehow believe 
that banning HTML would eradicate spam (instead of creating more plain text spam, 
which is what would happen). So, what to do? 
The best way to avoid being blocked, deleted, flagged, junked, or just plain ignored 
is to work very hard at making your emails relevant, usable, and useful. That means 
providing the information you promised when people signed up, and not taking 
the permission granted for one type of information and stretching it out to cover 
other topics. 
Practically, this means being clear about why people should sign up, and then 
providing those benefits consistently. As designers, we can take this all the way 
from the initial sign-up form. Compare the two sign-up forms shown in Figure 5.1 
and Figure 5.2. 
Figure 5.1. Generic form

Understanding Permission 
Figure 5.2. Sign-up form explaining benefits and showing an example issue 
Even before any email is sent, each form has created its distinct audience. People 
who signed up through the first form will be expecting a newsletter, yes, but what 
will it contain? What will it look like? How frequently will they receive it? 
They could be imagining something quite different from what you actually intend 
to send. If it turns out to be unsatisfactory, they may simply unsubscribe. But they 
might also mark your email as spam. Subscribers to the second form will be expecting 
exactly what you intend to send, so they’ll know it when they see it, and they’re 
more likely to remember signing up for it. 
Designing for relevance carries through to the content. You need to make sure that 
not only is the actual subject matter relevant, but that the design makes this clear 
by putting the valuable information up front, rather than burying it in unrelated 
promotions or cross-selling. 
Providing timely and useful information is the best defense against spam complaints, 
not to mention apathy and indifference. After all, receiving no response at all can 
be even more disheartening than receiving complaints. 
Understanding Spam Complaints 
Even the cleanest, most permission-based of lists will probably result in a complaint 
or two eventually. Not every complaint is legitimate—some are accidentally triggered, 
and others are from readers who think that hitting “mark as spam” is the easiest 
way to unsubscribe. As we saw in the section called “Permission versus Spam”, 
many email software companies are actively encouraging this kind of behavior, so 
you need to know what it means and how to react.

Spam complaints come in a few forms, so knowing what they all are helps when 
trying to avoid them (as well as when dealing with the ones that are impossible to 
avoid). 
Direct Complaints 
Direct complaints are when a subscriber actively sends an email that says, literally, 
“This is spam” or calls on the phone. The complaint might come directly to you or 
to your client, or to your email service provider, or even to the ISP that provides 
bandwidth for the servers that send the emails. 
Feedback Loops 
Some ISPs and email providers (Comcast and Hotmail are two examples) have 
special systems set up that can collect complaints from their users and forward 
them on in a specific format to the email service provider that send the emails. 
The service provider then receives those complaints and processes them according 
to its company policy. In the case of Campaign Monitor, the recipient is automatically 
unsubscribed, and a record is added to the sender’s campaign report showing that 
a complaint was made. This is fairly typical of the way feedback loop complaints 
are handled. 
Feedback loops are almost always triggered by direct action (that is, a reader clicking 
a “Mark as spam” button or similar) rather than by an automated filter process. So 
the end result is much the same as a direct complaint, except that it can more easily 
be acted on, since it’s in a format that can be actioned by an automated software 
process. 
If you choose to use an email service provider, you can check with them as to 
whether they’re integrated with feedback loops. While it might seem risky to open 
yourself up to such direct complaints, it’s better to handle them right away than 
find out that you’ve been blacklisted later on.3 
3 You can find a list of the major feedback loops at http://blog.deliverability.com/feedback.html.

117 
Understanding Permission 
Automated Filtering 
Some email systems will generate warnings and complaints when they detect a 
certain volume or frequency of emails that are considered possible spam. Generally 
those will be sent to your email service provider rather than directly to you as the 
sender, but your email service provider would then follow up with you. 
What to Do with Spam Complaints 
In all cases, being able to show how permission was obtained for any particular 
subscriber is critical. A fast, detailed response to a complaint that provides permis­
sion details and offers to unsubscribe the address will usually avoid any ongoing 
problems. 
Clients often feel understandably defensive about their lists and can be tempted to 
respond aggressively, but it’s important to make them understand that this kind of 
response is counterproductive. Although some complaints may well be unfair, email 
providers have to take each one seriously, so it pays to be prepared with evidence 
of an email list that’s fully permission-based. 
Keeping a record of who has complained is essential, in order to avoid emailing 
them again. Some email systems will do this for you, and you should find out if 
that’s the case for your provider. 
Above all, spam complaints are valuable feedback and should be accepted as your 
recipients letting you know something about your list. By reading their minds a 
little, we can interpret a simple spam complaint in different ways: 
“I don’t remember signing up for this.” 
How long ago did the people on your list sign up? It could be that the span of 
time between signing up and receiving an email was too long, or that the sign-
up form was unclear about how frequent the emails would be. 
“I did not agree to these emails.” 
Was the opt-in process very clear? A common cause of complaints is forcing 
people to join your list as part of entering a competition. Both the sign-up form 
and the emails themselves need to be extremely clear about what’s happening.

If a reader signed up to win a prize, but the first email makes no mention of the 
competition at all, they’re much more likely to consider it spam. 
“This is not useful information.” 
Perhaps the content of the email isn’t what was promised. Don’t promise useful 
hints and tips and then send promotional junk every month. 
“I don’t care about this anymore.” 
Maybe the reader just moved on and no longer has a need for your product or 
service. The spam complaint might mean they don’t want to receive your emails 
anymore and thought hitting “Mark as spam” was the best way to achieve it. 
“I can’t be bothered to unsubscribe.” 
Related to the previous point. As I’ve already mentioned, making the unsubscribe 
link hard to find is self-defeating. If your reader doesn’t want any more emails, 
don’t try to trick them into staying on your list. Put a simple and clear unsub­
scribe link right up front, and avoid forcing people to complain. 
Any email newsletter service you use will have their own spam complaint process, 
which you’ll need to know about and explain to clients. Most people never run into 
serious complaints, but it can happen and you do need to be prepared. 
How many complaints is too many? 
There isn’t any one number that you can rely on. Every email service will have their 
own “safe” level, but even one complaint can cause problems if it reveals that per­
mission was not obtained properly. 
In practice, there’s always a “normal” level of complaints, appearing like background 
radiation no matter what you do. That number is typically very low, around 0.01%. 
If your campaigns are receiving complaints at around that frequency, there’s no 
need to be too concerned. 
Obviously, if you’re dealing with very small lists one complaint can be a big per­
centage, so in order to gain an accurate view you’ll need to average it out over a 
number of campaigns. 
Again, check with the system you use to email, or with your ISP, as to what they 
consider to be a bad number of complaints.

Understanding Permission 
How can I know if my client has permission?  
When you’re sending your own campaigns, you have all the information you need 
to know whether your list is permission-based, and what kind of emails the people 
on the list will be expecting. When it comes to dealing with clients, however, it can 
be a little bit trickier. 
You can ask them to read the permission rules that apply for your chosen email 
service, but how can you know if they’re giving you all the information? There are 
a few guidelines for exploring how permission was obtained that should help avoid 
unpleasant surprises after sending. 
Ask for Details 
Don’t settle for a simple “yes, this list is fine.” Ask more detailed questions, such 
as “Can you give me a list of the different ways people can make it onto this list, 
like forms on your website, or signing up in person or by email?” 
This will make your client think in more depth about how the list was constructed, 
and may bring up some new information. 
Restate Their Permission Answer and Ask for 
Confirmation 
If you’ve asked your client whether they followed all the relevant guidelines, and 
they say that they have but you’re still concerned, seek a direct confirmation. 
“Just to confirm, all 955 of these people signed up on your website. You didn’t add 
anyone at all?” If they’ve any doubts or have forgotten other ways, this could help 
them remember. 
Compare the Explanation Given to the Email Content 
See if the email content makes sense in the context of how the list was supposedly 
gathered. If your client is telling you that their list is made up customers who’ve 
recently bought a certain product, but their email copy directly promotes that same 
product, that’s a sign you should ask a few more questions.

Explain Why it Matters 
Most people think that their entire subscriber list will be ecstatic to hear from them. 
Clients often won’t realize that there are risks for them in sending to a list that isn’t 
permission-based. If they receive spam complaints, but they do have explicit per­
mission from each person they emailed, then it can be resolved. On the other hand, 
if they receive complaints from people who fall outside the legal or commercial 
criteria for having given permission, their account could be closed or they could be 
blacklisted. 
Going through this process with your clients can be annoying, but it will protect 
their reputation—and also your own—if complaints do start to come in. If your 
client is sending from their own servers or from a dedicated IP address, blacklists 
are also a concern. 
Blacklists, Whitelists, and Sender Reputation 
Due to years of abuse from deliberate spammers, hundreds of services have popped 
up to deal with this problem. If you’re using an external provider, they’ll generally 
take care of ensuring that their emails bypass these anti-spam services. 
If you’re using your own servers, your client’s servers, or a dedicated external 
server, the task will fall to your client and their consultants to handle it. Such details 
fall outside the scope of this book, but having a good understanding of what blacklists 
are and how they work will help with planning and implementing your email 
campaigns. 
Blacklists 
In the email world, a blacklist (also called DNSBL for DNS Based Black List) is a 
list of IP addresses that are linked in some way to spam. Anti-spam software and 
mail servers can refer to this list of addresses when receiving mail, to decide 
whether to allow it to be delivered. Blacklists can form a part, or the whole, of the 
process of filtering an email. 
If the server you use to send email is listed on a major blacklist, your emails may 
be more heavily filtered, or be blocked altogether. A major part of an email service

121 
Understanding Permission 
provider’s value is in monitoring these lists and making sure that their IP addresses 
remain off blacklists. 
Inevitably, legitimate servers will be listed (perhaps because of inaccurate com­
plaints), but a good email service will follow up and usually be delisted fairly 
quickly. If your client wants to handle sending the emails themselves, or wants you 
to handle it, you should make them aware of the amount of work that can be involved 
in managing this part of the equation. 
To find out if a particular IP address is listed, you can go directly to a specific list 
provider. Alternatively, you can use one of the aggregator tools, such as DNSBL.info,4 
and enter the IP address there. 
Whitelists 
Where a blacklist works by letting all email past except for mail from specific IPs, 
a whitelist takes the opposite approach and blocks everything by default. Only email 
from a specified set of IP addresses is allowed past. 
Historically, some of the large email providers did have systems for whitelisting 
known senders, but this approach is becoming increasingly rare as they move to 
reputation-based systems that measure complaints, volume of sends, bounces, and 
the like. If your client is having problems reaching a particular domain, especially 
if it belongs to a smaller company, requesting to be added to the domain’s whitelist 
can often resolve the problem. 
Overall, this kind of list-based spam system is only a small part of the email game. 
If we all concentrate on sending relevant, useful information that people have actu­
ally requested, we’ll be in the best position to have our emails delivered in the long 
term.

Sender Reputation 
While both blacklists and whitelists are declining in relevance and importance, 
sender reputation is rapidly becoming the key way of ensuring emails are delivered. 
Organizations like Return Path5 provide a service that ranks email senders according 
to a combination of metrics mixed into a single score that represents the reputation 
of the sender. 
Email administrators and providers can use that rating in their filtering when decid­
ing if an email is legitimate. According to Ken Takahashi of Return Path, the follow­
ing elements make up a sender reputation: 
■  the volume of email you send (and how consistent that volume is) 
■  the number and percentage of bounces your emails receive 
■  the rate of complaints 
■  whether you’re emailing known spam trap addresses (email addresses specifically 
set up just to catch spam, and never opted into or signed up for anything) 
■  longevity of business (how long you’ve been sending) 
■  infrastructure (whether you have all the capabilities to handle authentication, 
bounces, unsubscribes, and the like) 
Looking at this list, it’s clear that a quality email service provider is well worth the 
cost, as there’s a lot of work in maintaining a system that deals with all those areas.6

Understanding Permission 
Understanding Authentication  
In this chapter, we’ve used the word “permission” to refer to an individual opting 
in to receive emails from a person or business. There’s also another definition of 
permission in email, and that is at the mail server level. 
Authentication is a way for a domain owner to say, “I give my permission for emails 
to be sent on my behalf by this mail server.” 
Because of the way email was originally built, it’s difficult to prove that an email 
is actually coming from the person who claims to be sending it. Email authentication 
fixes this by letting you add some simple information to your domain’s DNS records 
that define who’s allowed to send email on your behalf. 
Without going into too much detail, there are two main authentication standards: 
Sender ID and DomainKeys/DKIM. Different ISPs use either or a combination of 
both, so to achieve the best results you would want to implement them both. 
All the large ISPs like AOL, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Gmail are using email authentica­
tion as an important layer in deciding whether to allow an email to be delivered. 
By using authentication, you can instantly bypass some filters, giving your campaigns 
a better chance of arriving in the destination inbox. 
Not only that, but many ISPs, such as Yahoo and Hotmail, will visually flag your 
email as authenticated, which helps to build trust between you and your subscribers, 
improving the chances of your emails being opened. To implement it, you’ll need 
access to the DNS for the sending domain, so it’s unfeasible if you want to apply it 
to your client’s hotmail.com address. For a corporate domain, adding authentication 
records (normally given to you by your email service provider) is a great idea. 
As of 2010, your email should still be delivered even if you are not using authenti­
cation, but there are signs that this could happen down the road, so it’s worth in­
vestigating now.

Permission and the Future of Email  
We’ve gone through a whole chapter and barely once mentioned HTML or CSS, but 
understanding permission is just as important as your ability to design and build 
emails. 
Every time you take on a new HTML email design job, you need to understand who 
the audience is, how they agreed to receive the email, and what benefit they’ll derive 
from it. Avoid the temptation of leaving it until the last minute, because the con­
sequences can be widespread and quite serious.

Selling Email to Your Clients 
You’ve spent time understanding the legalities of email, and learning the technical­
ities of creating HTML email that looks great across all of the most common email 
clients. Now it’s time to gain a return on the time you’ve already invested in email! 
Selling email services is a logical step forward for freelance web designers and de­
velopers. This chapter will look at the practicalities of selling email to existing and 
new clients. Once we review the reasons you should add email to your service of­
fering, we’ll take a closer look at the variety of email-related services that you can 
offer, and what is involved in selling email services. We will cover the common 
approaches to pricing and preparing a folio of email samples, and discuss tips for 
a winning client pitch. 
Why Sell Email Services? 
We’ve spent the last five chapters of this book discussing HTML email from every 
perspective. So perhaps this section would be more appropriately titled, “Why 
wouldn’t you sell email services?”

More than Just a Designer or Developer … 
If you see yourself purely as a web designer or developer, it’s time to broaden that 
view. The first important step in selling your email services is to recognize your 
capabilities in email design and delivery. Then you’ll be able to see—and 
present—yourself as someone who designs or develops more than websites alone. 
There’s one particularly good reason why you should sell email services. If you’re 
freelancing, email services provide a prime opportunity to maintain ongoing, poten­
tially lucrative relationships with clients. Designers and developers often find that 
they have few reasons to continue the client relationship once they’ve delivered 
the site they were contracted to provide. Email is a very handy solution to the 
challenge of maintaining close client relationships over time. 
A client who’s just paid good money to have a website developed will usually be 
quick to grasp the potential that email marketing offers, and they’ll want to make 
the most of it. As we know, email is an established, widely used online marketing 
tool that’s readily embraced by users: according to a MarketingSherpa report from 
2010,1 65% of all email users felt that email was the best way for companies to 
communicate with them. As stated back in the section called “Email: The Heart of 
the Internet” in Chapter 1, it’s also extremely measurable and cost-effective. For 
clients who are focused on brand—and revenue—building online, email will usually 
be a logical, and, indeed, essential part of the plan. And who better than you, their 
trusted web designer or developer, to provide that service? 
Similarly, email services can be a good way to get your foot in the door of organiza­
tions for which you’d like to do more work. Approach a prospect who you know 
doesn’t currently use email to communicate with industry or client contacts, secure 
a contract to design and deliver a new email newsletter or catalog, and you might 
have the beginnings of a great—and growing—business relationship. 
In any case, the benefits of a recurring revenue that results from an ongoing contract 
for email services are evident. If you’ve been looking to provide add-on services 
that will give you a reliable bread-and-butter income each month, email offerings 
are an excellent place to start.

Selling Email to Your Clients 
What Can You Sell?  
So, you want to sell email services. What exactly does that mean? 
Identify Your Expertise 
Before you try to work out what you can sell, it’s important to recognize the dif­
ference between selling technical services and selling marketing services. For 
those of us who’ve spent our careers designing and building websites, it may seem 
quite a leap to shift from that skill set to selling email services. What if the client 
wants advice on audience segmentation, content strategy, or some other marketing-
related aspect of email? 
Perhaps you already have experience in email marketing, so you’re comfortable 
with responding to client questions on these topics. On the other hand, you may 
prefer to restrict your offering to the purely technical: design, testing, delivery, 
list management, and tracking. Whatever the case, now is a good time to start 
thinking about these issues and identifying the areas in which you feel you can 
best help your clients. 
In this section, we’ll stick specifically to the technical aspects of the email services 
you might sell. If you want to move beyond these to sell email marketing services, 
SitePoint’s The Email Marketing Kit (Melbourne: SitePoint, 2007), by Jeanne S. 
Jennings, has all the advice you’ll need. 
If you’re a freelancer, it’s likely you’ve already identified the essential skills you’ll 
be able to sell to clients: 
Email template design 
We talked about designing email in Chapter 3, and developing a robust email 
template in Chapter 4; these are obviously saleable skills. You might also choose 
to package landing page design with this service for cases where the client’s 
running a campaign that needs specific functionality or a particular sales focus. 
If your client is requesting a template for a regular email newsletter, you can 
also include the design of the subscription page. 
Email management system development 
Some clients will be happy to manage their emails through a third-party web-
based system. If you’re a developer, however, you may be able to create your

128 
own and provide a full proprietary email solution—from list management to 
template design—to clients who want to administer their own email subscription 
lists and communications securely on their own system. 
Email delivery 
Despite the wealth of usable email marketing tools out there, many clients are 
hesitant to take responsibility for inputting and sending emails themselves. If 
you’re happy to drop the template you’ve developed into your own, or a web-
based, email service, prepare the mailing list, and hit the Send button, those 
clients may be happy to pay you for your help. 
List management 
Remember the legal pitfalls we discussed in Chapter 5? It’s no surprise that 
many site managers would prefer to hand responsibility for the management of 
email lists, subscriptions, and unsubscribes to a skilled professional like you. 
If your client wants to merge two databases into one, they may need you to wash 
the databases against one another to remove problem addresses (invalid and 
dummy addresses, for example) from the mix, as well as ensure that individuals 
who’ve signed up to both lists are included in the merged subscriber list only 
once. 
Campaign review and consultation 
We’re straying into email marketing territory here, but even if you decide you’ll 
only provide technical services, you may be able to recommend layout or design 
tweaks that might boost subscription rates, increase open rates, or reduce opt-
outs for your clients. You might also provide A/B testing facilities (including 
design, delivery, and review) for clients who want to hone their email marketing 
efforts. 
Within these broad categories, you may be able to think of a number of offerings to 
interest existing or prospective customers. The way you integrate these offerings 
will depend on your clients, your level of interest, and how you choose to package 
your services. 
As an example, you might decide to offer a full email newsletter service that includes 
the following features:

How to Sell Email Services 
Now that you’ve worked out what you’re going to sell, let’s think about how you’ll 
sell it. 
Selling email services involves three components. The first task is to work out what 
you’ll charge for your offering, and on what basis you’ll apply those charges. We’ll 
look at this topic next. 
Then, you’ll need to work out how to pitch these new services successfully to your 
clients. In the section called “Preparing Your Pitch” I’ll prepare a few items that 
can help you communicate the possibilities and benefits of email for your clients. 
Finally, in the section called “Promoting Email Services to Clients and Prospects” 
we’ll look at the ways you might announce your new email services to existing and 
prospective clients. We’ll also see how you can integrate them seamlessly into your 
overall service offering.

Pricing Email Marketing Services 
When it comes to pricing your services, the world is, effectively, your oyster. Let’s 
look at pricing on the basis of the way you might offer your services: on a per-skill 
basis, and as a series of package deals. 
Pricing Your Skills 
If you’ve decided to sell your services on the basis of skills—template design, deliv­
ery, list management, and so on—you’re probably looking at two charging options. 
The most obvious option is to charge by the hour, but you could charge a flat fee 
instead; the latter acts as a sort of “easy sell” that stops your less confident or more 
budget-conscious clients from worrying just how much they’ll wind up paying for 
the service. Table 6.1 lists some of the services we discussed above, and identifies 
their most common pricing options. 
Table 6.1. Services and the Common Charging Options 
Charging options

List and image hosting 
As you can see in Table 6.1, the one area where charging by the hour is less appro­
priate is where the list size plays a role. Many freelancers base their email delivery 
service charges on the size of the mail-out, since the costs of the mailing increase 
as the list grows. The same logic applies to hosting and list management service 
charges.

Selling Email to Your Clients 
It’s also important to note that although some of these services—particularly list 
and image hosting—may be included in a web-based email management service 
package, many freelancers charge clients separately for them. It’s true that these 
items might fall outside the freelancer’s direct action. However, they may see these 
charges as offsetting related costs that may not be covered by their own client service 
package price. For example, if they need to liaise with the email service’s support 
team over the hosting of image files, or to obtain backups of client data at some 
point, there’ll be no need to charge the client separately for those hours, since they’ve 
already been covered by the hosting price. 
In choosing which pricing method to use, you’ll probably gravitate toward your 
current pricing approach. But you should always consider how the client will react. 
If they’re unfamiliar with email marketing and have never collected details for a 
subscriber list before, a flat fee may put their minds at ease regarding the potential 
of costs escalating. Alternatively, your existing clients may be curious if you, a 
staunch by-the-hour designer, suddenly offer services for a flat fee. And if you do 
opt for flat-fee pricing, keep in mind that some clients will take up more of your 
time than others. 
You might want to set your price at a point that allows for some back and forth with 
the client, or contains a percentage of “fat” for unexpected discussions or delays. 
This is especially relevant if you’ve created a flat-fee structure to convince clients 
who are inexperienced with email to give it a try. You may need to do extra legwork 
to keep them comfortable and answer their questions as the development progresses. 
Be sure to allow some form of extra time in your flat-fee structure. 
Ultimately, the answer to the question of pricing really depends on you, your clients, 
your relationships, and the way you do business. If you’d feel happier charging by 
the hour for everything, and you can sell this option to current and potential clients, 
go for it. 
Pricing Service Packages 
Pricing service packages like the one we discussed in the section called “What Can 
You Sell?” will obviously require you to work out how much you’ll charge for each 
component of the package first. You may find that when you group tasks into a 
complete bundle, working on them becomes more of a fluid process than would 
completing these tasks individually. You also stand to gain economies in the project

132 
management aspect of the job, given that you’ll be working with one client across 
the spectrum of tasks. These continuity benefits might allow you to shave an hour 
off here or there, providing better value than you would if providing the services 
individually. 
But what should you do if a client wants only some of the services on offer? The 
example we saw in the section called “What Can You Sell?” included A/B testing. 
But what if, perhaps for reasons of time or budget pressure, your client doesn’t want 
to test their email? Can you remove that service from the package? If so, by how 
much will that affect the package’s price? 
If you’ve reduced your overall package price to account for the benefits that the 
continuity of the work will bring, you won’t want to cut the package price by the 
original cost you allotted to A/B testing, since that now represents a larger portion 
of the “optimized” price. In this case, it might be more accurate to reduce the 
overall package cost by a percentage of that original sum you calculated for A/B 
testing. 
Perhaps you’ll develop a standard calculation that allows you to to drop in or pull 
out components of your service package easily. This will make it easier to establish 
how much the price will change if a client adds or removes a component from the 
package, and saves you having to go back to the pricing drawing board every time 
they decide to add or drop a service. 
However you structure your pricing, it’s important that you communicate it clearly 
and transparently to clients. We’ll look at these considerations next. 
Preparing Your Pitch 
In preparing to actually sell your email services to clients and prospects, you’ll need 
more than an idea of what you’ll offer and how you’ll charge. Your clients may be 
eager email marketers, or they may have no experience at all in this field. You’ll 
know where your clients sit on this spectrum, and from this point it’s a matter of 
putting together the collateral that will convince them to pay for your email services.

Selling Email to Your Clients 
Your Sales Pitch  
Whether you prepare a pre-sales whitepaper to introduce prospects to the benefits 
of email services, or simply spend half an hour discussing the topic with them over 
a coffee, you need to be able to prove that email marketing delivers. 
The Direct Marketing Association’s research on the average return on investment 
for email is available on its site,2 and its key findings are regularly reported in 
various news sources. A quick web search will turn up the most current research 
results, which you can use in your discussions with clients. The same is true for 
data on email market penetration, its usage by organizations in particular countries, 
and the acceptance of email marketing by target recipients. This kind of information 
can make persuasive reading (or listening!) for your prospects. You might even 
consider creating a quick comparison of how email performs against other marketing 
tactics to clearly indicate the effectiveness of email. 
As well as answering the question, “Why should I use email?”, you might need to 
explain to prospects why they need to pay for email when they can send it from 
their own computers free of charge. You’ll want to show them how easy, flexible, 
and cost-effective email campaign management can be, and the benefits it delivers. 
Explain the kinds of headaches prospects can avoid if they use appropriate tools to 
manage their mailing lists. Step them through the process of setting up a test cam­
paign in your system, using them and yourself as recipients. And highlight the value 
of the tracking data they can gain through a properly managed campaign, perhaps 
by showing them examples of tracking reports. 
If you’ve already run a campaign or two for clients (or yourself) you might prepare 
case examples of those campaigns that identify the clients’ objectives, how you met 
their needs, and what sort of results they obtained in a given time frame. Be sure 
to obtain permission to mention the names of the clients to which you’ve provided 
email services—it’s sure to encourage your prospects to start wondering if they’ll 
be left behind if they bypass email marketing.

Lacking any real-life email campaign results? 
If you don’t have any results of actual campaigns that are suitable to use as case 
studies, you might be able to compile that information in other ways: 
■  Ask a peer or associate if they can provide you with some live, anonymous 
data to use in your sales kit. 
■  Run a few campaigns of your own for side projects you have on the go, and 
use that information to create reports that prove how easy it is to monitor email 
campaigns. 
■  Search for such case studies online or in relevant print publications. Educa­
tional email marketing materials often detail real-life campaigns and explain 
how and why they were successful. 
Finally, compile electronic and printed examples of different email types so that 
your prospects can gain a clear idea of which formats might work for them. Consider 
also preparing a schedule of rates for your email services or packages so they can 
see at a glance what kind of money they need to spend to reach a given audience 
size. 
Your Email Service Folio 
A email service folio is an excellent sales tool, as it provides visual proof that you 
can create what you promise. Even if you’re just starting out in this field, and you 
have no working email examples, you might create samples of the different email 
types to show prospects. A collection of carefully honed examples will indicate 
even to the least creative of your prospects what you can do for them. 
Your Name Here! 
While you’re preparing different email examples, why not tailor them specifically 
to your prospects? You could include their logo and brand name in the design, 
and reflect their products, services, and clientele in the content. As well as atten­
tion-grabbing, this tactic can help your prospects establish a connection between 
their brand and email marketing.

Selling Email to Your Clients 
If you have real campaign data, marry the creative examples with brief fact sheets 
that identify the response rates generated, and the return the clients gained on their 
investments. This information will go a long way to convincing prospects that you 
know what you’re doing. Not only does it show that you’re focused on the business 
benefits of email, it also proves that you can help them achieve real results. 
Presenting your folio online, along with case information, testimonials, and results 
data wherever you can is undoubtedly your best option for presenting your email 
service capabilities. Once you’ve completed email projects for a few clients, you 
might like to present a case study for each of the services or packages you offer. In 
the meantime, publish examples of your creative output to show off your capabilities 
in email marketing. 
Promoting Email Services to Clients and Prospects 
So you’ve prepared your sales materials, and you’re ready to start selling email 
services. Great! But how can you promote those services to your clients? Should 
you just give them a call and set up a meeting to discuss the topic? Or try to slip 
email services casually into your next conversation? 
Your sales approach will depend on your clients and your own personal style. Here 
are a few tactics you might consider for communicating your new service to clients: 
Start your own email newsletter 
If you’re yet to do so already, create an email newsletter that you can send reg­
ularly to clients. You might use it to keep them updated on your service offering 
and additions to your online folio, point them to research that may help them 
use their website to its full potential, or provide them with web tips and hints. 
A well-planned and executed email newsletter can be a good way to practice 
what, effectively, you’re trying to preach. It’ll also give you some folio pieces 
and live mailing statistics that you can use in sales pitches. 
Add the new service offering to your website 
Remember to add information about your email services to your website. Poten­
tial clients who visit the site will then be aware of your full service offering, 
which is likely to push you higher up their shortlist of potential providers.

Approach existing clients 
Go through your current client list and identify the businesses you believe will 
particularly benefit from your new services. Contact the appropriate people to 
set up a meeting so you can explain how email might fit into their marketing 
and online strategies. If you’ve prepared a whitepaper or article about the benefits 
of email, you might opt to send it through to them before the meeting. Finally, 
tailor a pitch that includes a specialized email sample with their brand and 
business, plus clear recommendations about the ways in which email might 
help them achieve their goals, and which of your services you believe will best 
benefit them. 
Approach new clients 
You may use your new services as a basis to target prospects who you haven’t 
worked with before. If you can see an opportunity for email in a given organiz­
ation, you might find others in the same industry that are yet to embrace the 
benefits of email. You may use some of the more traditional promotional 
means—printing postcards, writing articles on email’s relevance and benefits 
for industry publications, attending local networking events, and so on—to 
reach these new clients. If you have a promotional budget, you may also try 
some email marketing of your own: create a targeted campaign to send to a 
qualified contact list that you’ve purchased from a reputable broker. 
Build email services into your brand 
You may think that adding your new service listing to your website and placing 
examples of your work in your folio is all you need to do to make email part of 
your repertoire. But these tactics are just the start—you can go much further. 
Consider: 
■  commenting on email marketing research, news and developments, the 
campaigns you’re working on, and the success of email as a communications 
medium through the social networking tools you use 
■  building email into every pitch you make to a client 
■  adding an “Email services” item to your website’s main navigation or your 
organization’s tag line

Selling Email to Your Clients 
■  making email integral to your own business’s communications, to build your 
brand, communicate with your audiences, and promote your offerings 
You may wish to avoid diluting the strong brand you’ve built by becoming “the 
email person” overnight. Despite this, focusing strongly on email can help es­
tablish it as a key part of your service offering, especially in the early stages. Be 
creative in your search for promotional opportunities. Perhaps you’ll put up 
your hand to mail match schedules and results to members of your soccer club, 
and maintain the subscriber email database. Design an eye-catching template 
on an otherwise quiet afternoon, and you may well impress some friends who 
want to use email in their businesses, or who know someone who could! 
Conclusion 
You’ve worked hard to develop skills in designing, coding, and distributing HTML 
email. It makes sense to put a price on those skills and sell them. 
We began this chapter by asking “Why sell email services?” Well, why wouldn’t 
you? We discussed shifting your mindset so that you no longer see yourself as purely 
a web designer or developer. Then we talked about just a few of the reasons you 
should sell email services—including the fact that, as a logical extension of your 
offering, email provides an excellent opportunity to maintain ongoing, paying rela­
tionships with clients. 
Throughout this book, I hope I’ve been able to show you that HTML email is a 
powerful tool both you and your clients should be using, and, moreover, that it re­
quires all the same familiar HTML and CSS skills you’ve been using for years. Now 
you have everything you need to gain a head start in this market. 
You have the skills and the knowledge. It’s time to take your email services to the 
world!
