Preface
Excel 2016 for Social Work Statistics: A Guide to Solving Practical Problems is
intended for anyone looking to learn the basics of applying Excel’s powerful
statistical tools to their social work courses or work activities. If understanding
statistics isn’t your strongest suit, you are not especially mathematically inclined, or
if you are wary of computers, then this is the right book for you.
Here you’ll learn how to use key statistical tests using Excel without being
overpowered by the underlying statistical theory. This book clearly and methodi-
cally shows and explains how to create and use these statistical tests to solve
practical problems in social work.
Excel is an easily available computer program for students, instructors, and
managers. It is also an effective teaching and learning tool for quantitative analyses
in social work courses. The powerful numerical computational ability and the
graphical functions available in Excel make learning statistics much easier than
in years past. However, this is the ﬁrst book to show Excel’s capabilities to more
effectively teach social work statistics; it also focuses exclusively on this topic in an
effort to render the subject matter not only applicable and practical but also easy to
comprehend and apply.
Unique features of this book:
•
You will be told each step of the way, not only how to use Excel but also why you
are doing each step so that you can understand what you are doing, and not
merely learn how to use statistical tests by rote.
•
Includes speciﬁc objectives embedded in the text for each concept, so you can
know the purpose of the Excel steps.
•
Includes 163 color screenshots so that you can be sure you are performing the
Excel steps correctly.
•
This book is a tool that can be used either by itself or along with any good
statistics book.
•
Practical examples and problems are taken from social work.
vii

•
Statistical theory and formulas are explained in clear language without bogging
you down in mathematical ﬁne points.
•
You will learn both how to write statistical formulas using Excel and how to use
Excel’s drop-down menus that will create the formulas for you.
•
This book does not come with a CD of Excel ﬁles which you can upload to your
computer. Instead, you’ll be shown how to create each Excel ﬁle yourself. In a
work situation, your colleagues will not give you an Excel ﬁle; you will be
expected to create your own. This book will give you ample practice in devel-
oping this important skill.
•
Each chapter presents the steps needed to solve a practical social work problem
using Excel. In addition, there are three practice problems at the end of each
chapter so you can test your new knowledge of statistics. The answers to these
problems appear in Appendix A.
•
A “Practice Test” is given in Appendix B to test your knowledge at the end of the
book. The answers to these practical social work problems appear in
Appendix C.
This book is appropriate for use in any course in social work statistics (at both
undergraduate and graduate levels) as well as for managers who want to improve
the usefulness of their Excel skills.

Acknowledgements
Excel 2016 for Social Work Statistics: A Guide to Solving Practical Problems is the
result of inspiration from three important people: my two daughters and my wife.
Jennifer Quirk McLaughlin invited me to visit her MBA classes several times at the
University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. These visits to a
ﬁrst-rate MBA program convinced me there was a need for a book to teach students
how to solve practical problems using Excel. Meghan Quirk-Horton’s dogged
dedication to learning the many statistical techniques needed to complete her
PhD dissertation illustrated the need for a statistics book that would make this
daunting task more user-friendly. And Lynne Buckley-Quirk was the number-one
cheerleader for this project from the beginning, always encouraging me and helping
me remain dedicated to completing it.
Michael Penn, our editor at Springer, shepherded this book through the idea
stages until it reached its ﬁnal form. His encouragement and support were vital to
this book seeing the light of day. We thank him for being such an outstanding
product champion throughout this process.
Thomas J. Quirk
Special thanks to my coauthor, Tom Quirk, for inviting me to work with him on this
project and for his wonderful collaboration. Special thanks also to our editor at
Springer, Michael Penn, for his support and assistance.

Chapter 1
Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation,
and Standard Error of the Mean
Social work attempts to improve people’s quality of life toward their full potential
as a person, as a group member, and in their community.
This chapter deals with how you can use Excel to ﬁnd the average (i.e., “mean”)
of a set of scores, the standard deviation of these scores (STDEV), and the standard
error of the mean (s.e.) of these scores. All three of these statistics are used
frequently and form the basis for additional statistical tests.
1.1
Mean
The mean is the “arithmetic average” of a set of scores. When my daughter was in
the ﬁfth grade, she came home from school with a sad face and said that she didn’t
get “averages.” The book she was using described how to ﬁnd the mean of a set of
scores, and so I said to her:
“Jennifer, you add up all the scores and divide by the number of numbers that you have.”
She gave me “that look,” and said: “Dad, this is serious!” She thought I was teasing her.
So I said:
“See these numbers in your book; add them up. What is the answer?” (She did that.)
“Now, how many numbers do you have?” (She answered that question.)
“Then, take the number you got when you added up the numbers, and divide that
number by the number of numbers that you have.”
She did that, and found the correct answer. You will use that same reasoning
now, but it will be much easier for you because Excel will do all of the steps for you.
We will call this average of the scores the “mean” which we will symbolize as:
X, and we will pronounce it as: “Xbar.”
The formula for ﬁnding the mean with your calculator looks like this:
X ¼
P X
n
ð1:1Þ

T.J. Quirk, S. Cummings, Excel 2016 for Social Work Statistics, Excel for Statistics,
DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-66221-3_1
1

The symbol Σ is the Greek letter sigma, which stands for “sum.” It tells you to
add up all the scores that are indicated by the letter X, and then to divide your
answer by n (the number of numbers that you have).
Let’s give a simple example:
Length of Stay (LOS) is the number of calendar days a patient stays in a health
care facility from admission to discharge. Suppose that you had these six LOS
scores for a random sample of mothers who gave birth and were discharged in the
past two weeks:
6
4
5
3
2
5
To ﬁnd the mean of these scores, you add them up, and then divide by the
number of scores. So, the mean is: 25/6 ¼ 4.17
1.2
Standard Deviation
The standard deviation tells you “how close the scores are to the mean.” If the
standard deviation is a small number, this tells you that the scores are “bunched
together” close to the mean. If the standard deviation is a large number, this tells you
that the scores are “spread out” a greater distance from the mean. The formula for the
standard deviation (which we will call STDEV) and use the letter, S, to symbolize is:
STDEV ¼ S ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
P 
X  X
2
n  1
s
ð1:2Þ
The formula look complicated, but what it asks you to do is this:
1. Subtract the mean from each score (X  X).
2. Then, square the resulting numbers to make each a positive number.
3. Then, add up these squared numbers to get a total score.
4. Then, take this total score and divide it by n  1 (where n stands for the number
of numbers that you have).
5. The ﬁnal step is to take the square root of the number you found in step 4.
You will not be asked to compute the standard deviation using your calculator in
this book, but you could see examples of how it is computed in any basic statistics
book (e.g. Bowers 2008; Engel and Shutt 2013). Instead, we will use Excel to ﬁnd
the standard deviation of a set of scores. When we use Excel on the six numbers we
gave in the description of the mean above, you will ﬁnd that the STDEV of these
numbers, S, is 1.47.

Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error of the Mean

1.3
Standard Error of the Mean
The formula for the standard error of the mean (s.e., which we will use SX to
symbolize) is:
s:e: ¼ S X ¼ Sﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð1:3Þ
To ﬁnd s.e., all you need to do is to take the standard deviation, STDEV, and
divide it by the square root of n, where n stands for the “number of numbers” that
you have in your data set. In the example under the standard deviation description
above, the s.e. ¼ 0.60. (You can check this on your calculator.)
If you want to learn more about the standard deviation and the standard error of
the mean, see Polit (2010) and Schneider (2010).
Now, let’s learn how to use Excel to ﬁnd the sample size, the mean, the standard
deviation, and the standard error or the mean using Length of Stay (LOS) for adult
men in a health care facility for eight men who were discharged in the past week.
The hypothetical data appear in Fig. 1.1.

1.4
Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard
Error of the Mean
Objective: To ﬁnd the sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (STDEV), and
standard error of the mean (s.e.) for these data
Start your computer, and click on the Excel 2016 icon to open a blank Excel
spreadsheet.
Click on: Blank workbook
Enter the data in this way:
B3:
Patient
C3:
Length of Stay (LOS)
B4:

1.4.1
Using the Fill/Series/Columns Commands
Objective: To add the sample numbers 2–8 in the patient column
Put pointer in B4
Home (top left of screen)
Important note: The “Paste” command should be on the top of your screen on
the far left of the screen.
Important note: Notice the Excel commands at the top of your computer screen:
File ! Home ! Insert ! Page Layout ! Formulas ! etc.
If these commands ever “disappear” when you are using Excel, you
need to click on “Home” at the top left of your screen to make them
reappear!
Fill (top right of screen: click on the Series down arrow; see Fig. 1.2)

Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error of the Mean

Series
Columns
Step value: 1
Stop value: 8 (see Fig. 1.3)
OK
The patient numbers should be identiﬁed as 1–8, with 8 in cell B11.
Now, enter the Length of Stay (LOS) ﬁgures in cells C4: C11. (Note: Be sure to
double-check your ﬁgures to make sure that they are correct or you will not get the
correct answer!)
Since your computer screen shows the information in a format that does not look
professional, you need to learn how to “widen the column width” and how to
“center the information” in a group of cells. Here is how you can do those two steps:
1.4.2
Changing the Width of a Column
Objective: To make a column width wider so that all of the information ﬁts
inside that column
If you look at your computer screen, you can see that Column C is not wide
enough so that all of the information ﬁts inside this column. To make Column C
wider:
Click on the letter, C, at the top of your computer screen
Place your mouse pointer on your computer at the far right corner of C until you
create a “cross sign” on that corner
Fig. 1.3 Example of Dialogue Box for Fill/Series/Columns/Step Value/Stop Value commands
1.4
Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error of the Mean
5

Left-click on your mouse, hold it down, and move this corner to the right until it is
“wide enough to ﬁt all of the data”
Take your ﬁnger off your mouse to set the new column width (see Fig. 1.4)
Then, click on any empty cell (i.e., any blank cell) to “deselect” column C so that
it is no longer a darker color on your screen.
When you widen a column, you will make all of the cells in all of the rows of this
column that same width.
Now, let’s go through the steps to center the information in both Column B and
Column C.
1.4.3
Centering Information in a Range of Cells
Objective: To center the information in a group of cells
In order to make the information in the cells look “more professional,” you can
center the information using the following steps:
Left-click your mouse pointer on B3 and drag it to the right and down to highlight
cells B3:C11 so that these cells appear in a darker color
At the top of your computer screen, you will see a set of “lines” in which all of
the lines are “centered” to the same width under “Alignment” (it is the second icon
at the bottom left of the Alignment box; see Fig. 1.5)
Fig. 1.4 Example of How
to Widen the Column Width

1
Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error of the Mean

Click on this icon to center the information in the selected cells (see Fig. 1.6)
Since you will need to refer to the Length of Stay in your formulas, it will be
much easier to do this if you “name the range of data” with a name instead of having
to remember the exact cells (C4:C11) in which these ﬁgures are located. Let’s call
that group of cells: LOS, but we could give them any name that you want to use.

1.4.4
Naming a Range of Cells
Objective: To name the range of data for Length of Stay with the name: LOS
Highlight cells C4:C11 by left-clicking your mouse pointer on C4 and dragging it
down to C11
Formulas (top left of your screen)
Deﬁne Name (top center of your screen)
LOS (type this name in the top box; see Fig. 1.7)
OK
Then, click on any cell of your spreadsheet that does not have any information in it
(i.e., it is an “empty cell”) to deselect cells C4:C11
Now, add the following terms to your spreadsheet:
E6:
n
E9:
Mean
E12:
STDEV
E15:
s.e. (see Fig. 1.8)
Note: Whenever use a formula you must add an equal sign (=) at the beginning of
the name of the function so that Excel knows that you indend to use a formula.

1.4.5
Finding the Sample Size Using the ¼COUNT Function
Objective: To ﬁnd the sample size (n) for these data using the ¼COUNT
function
F6:
¼COUNT(LOS)
This command should insert the number 8 into cell F6 since there are eight patients
in your sample.
1.4.6
Finding the Mean Score Using the ¼AVERAGE
Function
Objective: To ﬁnd the mean LOS ﬁgure using the ¼AVERAGE function
F9:
¼AVERAGE(LOS)
This command should insert the number 7.125 into cell F9.

1.4.7
Finding the Standard Deviation Using the ¼STDEV
Function
Objective: To ﬁnd the standard deviation (STDEV) using the ¼STDEV
function
F12:
¼STDEV(LOS)
This command should insert the number 3.482097 into cell F12.
1.4.8
Finding the Standard Error of the Mean
Objective: To ﬁnd the standard error of the mean using a formula for these eight
data points
F15:
¼F12/SQRT(8)
This command should insert the number 1.231107 into cell F15 (see Fig. 1.9).

Important note: Throughout this book, be sure to double-check all of the ﬁgures in
your spreadsheet to make sure that they are in the correct cells, or
the formulas will not work correctly!
1.4.8.1
Formatting Numbers in Number Format (Two Decimal Places)
Objective: To convert the mean, STDEV, and s.e. to two decimal places
Highlight cells F9:F15
Home (top left of screen)
Look under “Number” at the top center of your screen. In the bottom right corner,
gently place your mouse pointer on you screen at the bottom of the .00 .0 until it
says: “Decrease Decimal” (see Fig. 1.10)
Click on this icon once and notice that the cells F9:F15 are now all in just two
decimal places (see Fig. 1.11)

Now, click on any “empty cell” on your spreadsheet to deselect cells F9:F15.
1.5
Saving a Spreadsheet
Objective: To save this spreadsheet with the name: LOS3
In order to save your spreadsheet so that you can retrieve it sometime in the
future, your ﬁrst decision is to decide “where” you want to save it. That is your
decision and you have several choices. If it is your own computer, you can save it
onto your hard drive (you need to ask someone how to do that on your computer).
Or, you can save it onto a “CD” or onto a “ﬂash drive.” To save the spreadsheet, you
need to complete these steps:
File
Save as
(select the place where you want to save the ﬁle by scrolling either down or up
the bar on the left, and click on the place where you want to save the ﬁle; for
example: This PC: My Documents location))
File name: LOS3 (enter this name to the right of File name; see Fig. 1.12)

The University of Missouri-St. Louis offers a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW)
degree that is fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The
program includes a requirement of 570 hours of ﬁeldwork in a social services
agency. Suppose that you are the Director of this program and that you want to
obtain suggestions as to how the program can be improved from the 32 students
who are scheduled to receive their degree in two months. Suppose, further, that you
want to take a random sample of 5 of these 32 students so that you can set up a time
for a personal interview with each of them.
Using your Excel skills to take this random sample, you will need to deﬁne a
“sampling frame.”
A sampling frame is a list of objects, events, or people from which you want to
select a random sample. In this case, it is the group of 32 students in your BSW
program. In order to deﬁne the sampling frame, you will ﬁrst assign a unique
identiﬁer to each person (or object) in the sampling frame. The frame starts with
the identiﬁcation code (ID) of 1 that is assigned to the ﬁrst student in the group of
32 students. The second student has a code number of 2, the third a code number of
3, and so forth, until the last student has a code number of 32.
Since the group had 32 students in the BSW program, your sampling frame
would go from 1 to 32 with each student having a unique ID number.
We will ﬁrst create the frame numbers as follows in a new Excel worksheet:

A3: FRAME NO.
A4: 1
Now, create the frame numbers in column A with the Home/Fill commands that
were explained in the ﬁrst chapter of this book (see Sect. 1.4.1) so that the frame
numbers go from 1 to 32, with the number 32 in cell A35. If you need to be
reminded about how to do that, here are the steps:
Click on cell A4 to select this cell
Home
Fill (then click on the “down arrow” next to this command and select)
Series (see Fig. 2.1)
Columns
Step value: 1
Stop value: 32 (see Fig. 2.2)
OK
Then, save this ﬁle as: Random29. You should obtain the result in Fig. 2.3.

Now, create a column next to these frame numbers in this manner:
B3: DUPLICATE FRAME NO.
B4: 1
Next, use the Home/Fill command again, so that the 32 frame numbers begin in
cell B4 and end in cell B35. Be sure to widen the columns A and B so that all of the
information in these columns ﬁts inside the column width. Then, center the infor-
mation inside both Column A and Column B on your spreadsheet. You should
obtain the information given in Fig. 2.4.

You are probably wondering why you created the same information in both
Column A and Column B of your spreadsheet. This is to make sure that before you
sort the frame numbers, you have exactly 32 of them when you ﬁnish sorting them
into a random sequence of 32 numbers.
Now, let’s add a random number to each of the duplicate frame numbers as
follows:

C3: RANDOM NO.
(then widen columns A, B, C so that their labels ﬁt inside the columns; then
center the information in A3:C35)
C4: ¼RAND()
Next, hit the Enter key to add a random number to cell C4.
Note that you need both an open parenthesis and a closed parenthesis to create
¼RAND(). The RAND command “looks to the left of the cell with the RAND()
COMMAND in it” and assigns a random number to that cell.
Now, put the pointer using your mouse in cell C4 and then move the pointer to
the bottom right corner of that cell until you see a “plus sign” in that cell. Then,
click and drag the pointer down to cell C35 to add a random number to all 32 ID
frame numbers (see Fig. 2.5).

Important note: Because Excel randomly assigns these random numbers, your
Excel commands will produce a different sequence of random
numbers from everyone else who reads this book!
Your objective at the beginning of this chapter was to randomly select 5 of the
32 students in your BSW program. You can now do that by selecting the ﬁrst ﬁve
sorted ID numbers in the DUPLICATE FRAME NO. column.
Although your ﬁrst ﬁve random numbers will be different from those we have
selected in the random sort that we did in this chapter, we would select these ﬁve
student IDs (see Fig. 2.9).

Remember, your ﬁve ID numbers selected after your random sort will be
different from the ﬁve ID numbers in Fig. 2.9 because Excel assigns a different
random number each time the ¼RAND() command is given.
Before we leave this chapter, you need to learn how to print a ﬁle so that all of
the information on that ﬁle ﬁts onto a single page without “dribbling over” onto a
second or third page.

The three practice problems at the end of this chapter require you to sort random
numbers when the ﬁles contain 63 social work students, 114 child maltreatment
reports, and 75 long-term-care facilities in Missouri, respectively. These ﬁles will
be “too big” to ﬁt onto one page when you print them unless you format these ﬁles
so that they ﬁt onto a single page.
Let’s create a situation where the ﬁle does not ﬁt onto one printed page unless
you format it ﬁrst to do that.
Go back to the ﬁle you just created, Random 32, and enter the name: Jennifer
into cell: A50.
If you printed this ﬁle now, the name, Jennifer, would be printed onto a second
page because it “dribbles over” outside of the page rage for this ﬁle in its current
format.
So, you would need to change the page format so that all of the information,
including the name, Jennifer, ﬁts onto just one page when you print this ﬁle by using
the following steps:
Click on any empty cell to change the pointer from cell A50
Page Layout (top left of the computer screen)
(Notice the “Scale to Fit” section in the center of your screen; see Fig. 2.10)
Hit the down arrow to the right of 100% once to reduce the size of the page to
95%
Now, note that the name, Jennifer, is still on a second page on your screen
because her name is below the horizontal dotted line on your screen in Fig. 2.11 (the
dotted lines tell you outline dimensions of the ﬁle if you printed it now).

So, you need to repeat the “scale change steps” by hitting the down arrow on the
right once more to reduce the size of the worksheet to 90% of its normal size.
Notice that the “dotted lines” on your computer screen in Fig. 2.12 are now
below Jennifer’s name to indicate that all of the information, including her name, is
now formatted to ﬁt onto just one page when you print this ﬁle.
Save the ﬁle as:

Print the ﬁle. Does it all ﬁt onto one page? It should (see Fig. 2.13).

End-of-Chapter Practice Problems
1. Suppose that you are the Director of the Master of Social Work (MSW) program
at The Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis, MO USA and you
want to interview a random sample of students who are scheduled to graduate so
that you can obtain their suggestions about how the program can be improved.
Assume that 63 students are scheduled to graduate, and that you want to
randomly select 15 of these 63 students for a personal interview with you.
(a) Set up a spreadsheet of frame numbers for these students with the heading:
FRAME NUMBERS using the Home/Fill commands.
(b) Then, create a separate column to the right of these frame numbers which
duplicates these frame numbers with the title: Duplicate frame numbers.
(c) Then, create a separate column to the right of these duplicate frame numbers
entitled RANDOM NO. and use the ¼RAND() function to assign random
numbers to all of the frame numbers in the duplicate frame numbers column,
and change this column format so that three decimal places appear for each
random number.
(d) Sort the duplicate frame numbers and random numbers into a random order.
(e) Print the result so that the spreadsheet ﬁts onto one page.
(f) Circle on your printout the I.D. number of the ﬁrst 15 students that you
would use in your interviews.
(g) Save the ﬁle as:
RAND9
Important note: Note that everyone who does this problem will generate a
different random order of ID numbers since Excel assigns a
different random number each time the RAND() command
is used. For this reason, the answer to the problem given in
this Excel Guide will have a completely different sequence
of random numbers from the random sequence that you
generate. This is normal and what is to be expected.
2. Suppose that a total of 114 child maltreatment reports have been submitted to a
state agency in the last month, and that you want to select a random sample of
10 children in this database of reports for case studies.
(a) Set up a spreadsheet of frame numbers for these claims with the heading:
FRAME NO.
(b) Then, create a separate column to the right of these frame numbers which
duplicates these frame numbers with the title: Duplicate frame no.
(c) Then, create a separate column to the right of these duplicate frame numbers
entitled “Random number” and use the ¼RAND() function to assign random
numbers to all of the frame numbers in the duplicate frame numbers column.
Then, change this column format so that three decimal places appear for
each random number.

Chapter 3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using
the TINV Function and Hypothesis Testing
This chapter focuses on two ideas: (1) ﬁnding the 95% conﬁdence interval about the
mean, and (2) hypothesis testing.
Let’s talk about the conﬁdence interval ﬁrst and then hypothesis testing.
3.1
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean
In statistics, we are often interested in estimating the population mean. How do we
do that?
3.1.1
How to Estimate the Population Mean
Objective: To estimate the population mean, μ
The population mean is an average of all people in a target population. For
example, if we were interested in how well adults ages 25–44 liked a new ﬂavor of
Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, we could never ask this question of all of the people in the
U.S. who were in that age group. Such a research study would take way too much
time to complete and would be cost prohibitive.
So, instead of testing everyone in the population, we take a sample of people in
the population and use the results of this sample to estimate the mean of the entire
population. This saves both time and money. When we use the results of a sample to
estimate the population mean, this is called “inferential statistics” because we are
inferring the population mean from the sample mean.

When we study a sample from a population, we know the size of our sample (n),
the mean of our sample (X), and the standard deviation of our sample (STDEV). We
use these ﬁgures to estimate the accuracy of our estimated population mean with a
test called the “conﬁdence interval about the mean.”
3.1.2
Estimating the Lower Limit and the Upper Limit
of the 95% Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean
The theoretical background of this test is beyond the scope of this book, and you can
learn more about this test from studying any good statistics textbook (e.g. Veney
et al. 2009; Rosenthal 2012) but the basic ideas are as follows.
We assume that the population mean is somewhere in an interval which has a
“lower limit” and an “upper limit” to it. We also assume in this book that we want to
be “95% conﬁdent” that the population mean is inside this interval somewhere. So,
we intend to make the following type of statement:
“We are 95% conﬁdent that the population mean of the number of outpatient visits to our
clinic during the past 12 months was between 3.25 visits and 3.67 visits.”
If we want to claim that the number of outpatient visits to our clinic during the
past 12 months was 3.50 visits, we can do this because 3.50 is inside the 95%
conﬁdence interval in our research study in the above example. We do not know
exactly what the population mean is, only that it is somewhere between 3.25 visits
and 3.67 visits, and 3.50 visits, which is our sample mean, is inside this interval.
But we are only 95% conﬁdent that the population mean is inside this interval,
and 5% of the time we will be wrong in assuming that the population mean is 3.50
visits.
For our purposes in science research, we are happy to be 95% conﬁdent that our
assumption is accurate. We should also point out that 95% is an arbitrary level of
conﬁdence for our results. We could choose to be 80% conﬁdent, or 90% conﬁdent,
or even 99% conﬁdent in our results if we wanted to do that. In this book, we will
always assume that we want to be 95% conﬁdent of our results. That way, you will
not have to guess on how conﬁdent you want to be in any of the problems in
this book.
So how do we ﬁnd the 95% conﬁdence interval about the mean for our data?
In words, we will ﬁnd this interval this way:
“Take the sample mean (X), and add to it 1.96 times the standard error of the mean (s.e.) to
get the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval. Then, take the sample mean, and subtract
from it 1.96 times the standard error of the mean to get the lower limit of the conﬁdence
interval.”
You will remember (See Sect. 1.3) that the standard error of the mean (s.e.) is
found by dividing the standard deviation of our sample (STDEV) by the square root
of our sample size, n.
36
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

In mathematical terms, the formula for the 95% conﬁdence interval about the
mean is:
X  1:96 s:e:
ð3:1Þ
Note that the “ sign” stands for “plus or minus,” and this means that you ﬁrst
add 1.96 times the s.e. of the mean to get the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval,
and then subtract 1.96 times the s.e. of the mean to get the lower limit of the
conﬁdence interval. Also, the symbol 1.96 s.e. means that you multiply 1.96 times
the standard error of the mean to get this part of the formula for the conﬁdence
interval.
Note: We will explain shortly where the number 1.96 came from.
Let’s try a simple example to illustrate this formula.
3.1.3
Estimating the Conﬁdence Interval for the Number
of Outpatient Visits to a Clinic
Let’s suppose that you have been asked to conduct a study of outpatient clinic visits.
Assume that you took a random sample of 36 patients who required outpatient care
in the past 12 months from these clinics and determined that they averaged 3.42
visits to the clinics with a standard deviation of 1.15 visits. The standard error (s.e.)
would be 1.15 divided by the square root of 36 (i.e., 6) which gives a s.e. equal to
0.19 visits.
The 95% conﬁdence interval for these data would be:
3:42  1:96 0:19
ð
Þ
The upper limit of this conﬁdence interval uses the plus sign of the  sign in the
formula. Therefore, the upper limit would be:
3:42 þ 1:96 0:19
ð
Þ ¼ 3:42 þ 0:37 ¼ 3:79 visits
Similarly, the lower limit of this conﬁdence interval uses the minus sign of the 
sign in the formula. Therefore, the lower limit would be:
3:42  1:96 0:19
ð
Þ ¼ 3:42  0:37 ¼ 3:05 visits
The result of our part of the ongoing research study would, therefore, be the
following:
“We are 95% conﬁdent that the population mean for the number of outpatient visits to these
clinics during the past 12 months was between 3.05 visits and 3.79 visits.”
3.1
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean
37

Based upon the fact that our sample mean of 3.50 visits is inside the conﬁdence
interval, we could conclude that the average number of outpatients visits to these
clinics in the past 12 months was 3.50 visits. Our data supports this claim because
3.50 visits is inside of this 95% conﬁdence interval for the population mean.
You are probably asking yourself: “Where did that 1.96 in the formula come
from?”
3.1.4
Where Did the Number “1.96” Come From?
A detailed mathematical answer to that question is beyond the scope of this book,
but here is the basic idea.
We make an assumption that the data in the population are “normally distrib-
uted” in the sense that the population data would take the shape of a “normal curve”
if we could test all of the people or properties in the population. The normal curve
looks like the outline of the Liberty Bell that sits in front of Independence Hall in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The normal curve is “symmetric” in the sense that if we
cut it down the middle, and folded it over to one side, the half that we folded over
would ﬁt perfectly onto the half on the other side.
A discussion of integral calculus is beyond the scope of this book, but essentially
we want to ﬁnd the lower limit and the upper limit of the population data in the
normal curve so that 95% of the area under this curve is between these two limits. If
we have more than 40 people in our research study, the value of these limits is plus
or minus 1.96 times the standard error of the mean (s.e.) of our sample. The number
1.96 times the s.e. of our sample gives us the upper limit and the lower limit of our
conﬁdence interval. If you want to learn more about this idea, you can consult a
good statistics book (e.g. Polit 2010).
The number 1.96 would change if we wanted to be conﬁdent of our results at a
different level from 95% as long as we have more than 40 people in our research
study.
For example:
1. If we wanted to be 80% conﬁdent of our results, this number would be 1.282.
2. If we wanted to be 90% conﬁdent of our results, this number would be 1.645.
3. If we wanted to be 99% conﬁdent of our results, this number would be 2.576.
But since we always want to be 95% conﬁdent of our results in this book, we will
always use 1.96 in this book whenever we have more than 40 people in our research
study.

3.1.5
Finding the Value for t in the Conﬁdence Interval
Formula
Objective: To ﬁnd the value for t in the conﬁdence interval formula
The correct formula for the conﬁdence interval about the mean for different sample
sizes is the following:
X  t s:e:
ð3:2Þ
To use this formula, you ﬁnd the sample mean, X , and add to it the value of t
times the s.e. to get the upper limit of this 95% conﬁdence interval. Also, you take
the sample mean ,X, and subtract from it the value of t times the s.e. to get the lower
limit of this 95% conﬁdence interval. And, you ﬁnd the value of t in the table given
in Appendix E of this book in the following way:
Objective: To ﬁnd the value of t in the t-table in Appendix E
Before we get into an explanation of what is meant by “the value of t,” let’s give
you practice in ﬁnding the value of t by using the t-table in Appendix E.
Keep your ﬁnger on Appendix E as we explain how you need to “read” that
table.
Since the test in this chapter is called the “conﬁdence interval about the mean
test,” you will use the ﬁrst column on the left in Appendix E to ﬁnd the critical value
of t for your research study (note that this column is headed: “sample size n”).
To ﬁnd the value of t , you go down this ﬁrst column until you ﬁnd the sample
size in your research study, and then you go to the right and read the value of t for
that sample size in the “critical t column” of the table (note that this column is the
column that you would use for the 95% conﬁdence interval about the mean).
For example, if you have 14 people in your research study, the value of t is 2.160.
If you have 26 people in your research study, the value of t is 2.060.
If you have more than 40 people in your research study, the value of t is always
1.96.
Note that the “critical t column” in Appendix E represents the value of t that you
need to use to be 95% conﬁdent that your results are “signiﬁcant”.
Throughout this book, we are assuming that you want to be 95% conﬁdent in the
results of your statistical tests. Therefore, the value for t in the t-table in Appendix E
tells you which value you should use for t when you use the formula for the 95%
conﬁdence interval about the mean.
Now that you know how to ﬁnd the value of t in the formula for the conﬁdence
interval about the mean, let’s explore how you ﬁnd this conﬁdence interval using
Excel.

3.1.6
Using Excel’s TINV Function to Find the Conﬁdence
Interval About the Mean
Objective: To use the TINV function in Excel to ﬁnd the conﬁdence interval
about the mean
When you use Excel, the formulas for ﬁnding the conﬁdence interval are:
Lower limit :
¼ XTINV 10:95;n1
ð
Þ∗s:e: nospaces between these symbols
ð
Þ
ð3:3Þ
Upper limit :
¼ XþTINV 10:95;n1
ð
Þ∗s:e: nospaces between these symbols
ð
Þ
ð3:4Þ
Note that the “* symbol” in this formula tells Excel to use multiplication in the
formula, and it stands for “times” in the way we talk about multiplication.
You will recall from Chap. 1 that n stands for the sample size, and so n  1
stands for the sample size minus one.
You will also recall from Chap. 1 that the standard error of the mean, s.e., equals
the STDEV divided by the square root of the sample size, n (See Sect. 1.3).
Let’s try a sample problem using Excel to ﬁnd the 95% conﬁdence interval about
the mean for a problem.
Let’s suppose that a clinic wanted to claim that the average number of outpatient
clinic visits during the past 12 months was 3.50 visits. Let’s call 3.50 visits the
“reference value” for this clinic.
Suppose, further, that you have been asked to check this claim to see if it holds
up based on some research evidence. You decide to collect some data and to use the
95% conﬁdence interval about the mean to test your results:
3.1.7
Using Excel to Find the 95% Conﬁdence Interval
for a Clinic’s Outpatient Visits
Objective: To analyze the data using a 95% conﬁdence interval about the mean
You select a random sample of 25 outpatients and record the number of visits
they made to this clinic during these 12 months. Your research study produces the
hypothetical results given in Fig. 3.1:
40

Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

Create a spreadsheet with these data and use Excel to ﬁnd the sample size (n), the
mean, the standard deviation (STDEV), and the standard error of the mean (s.e.) for
these data using the following cell references.
A3: Outpatient Visits
A5: Visits during the past 12 months
A6: 2
Enter the other Outpatient Visits data in cells A7:A30
Now, highlight cells A6:A30 and format these numbers in number format (zero
decimal places). Center these numbers in Column A. Then, widen columns A and B
by making both of them three times as wide as the original width of column
A. Then, widen column C so that it is three times as wide as the original width of
column A so that your table looks more professional.

D7:
Use Excel to ﬁnd the sample size
D10: Use Excel to ﬁnd the mean
D13: Use Excel to ﬁnd the STDEV
D16: Use Excel to ﬁnd the s.e.
Now, you need to ﬁnd the lower limit and the upper limit of the 95% conﬁdence
interval for this study.
We will use Excel’s TINV function to do this. We will assume that you want to
be 95% conﬁdent of your results.
F21 :
¼ D10  TINV 1  :95; 24
ð
Þ∗D16
no spaces between symbols
ð
Þ
Note that this TINV formula uses 24 since 24 is one less than the sample size of
25 (i.e., 24 is n  1). Note that D10 is the mean, while D16 is the standard error of
the mean. The above formula gives the lower limit of the conﬁdence interval, 2.78.

F23 :
¼ D10 þ TINV 1  :95; 24
ð
Þ∗D16

The above formula gives the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval, 4.02.
Now, use number format (two decimal places) in your Excel spreadsheet for the
mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, and for both the lower limit
and the upper limit of your conﬁdence interval. If you printed this spreadsheet now,
the lower limit of the conﬁdence interval (2.78) and the upper limit of the conﬁ-
dence interval (4.02) would “dribble over” onto a second printed page because the
information on the spreadsheet is too large to ﬁt onto one page in its present format.
So, you need to use Excel’s “Scale to Fit” commands that we discussed in
Chap. 2 (see Sect. 2.4) to reduce the size of the spreadsheet to 80% of its current
size using the Page Layout/Scale to Fit function. Do that now, and notice that the
dotted line to the right of 2.78 and 4.02 indicates that these numbers would now ﬁt
onto one page when the spreadsheet is printed out (see Fig. 3.4)
Note that you have drawn a picture of the 95% conﬁdence interval beneath cell
B26, including the lower limit, the upper limit, the mean, and the reference value of
3.50.

Now, let’s write the conclusion to your research study on your spreadsheet:
C33: Since the reference value of 3.50 is inside the
C34: conﬁdence interval, we accept that the average
C35: number of outpatient visits to the clinic during
C36: the past 12 months was 3.50 visits.
Important note: You are probably wondering why we wrote the conclusion on four
separate lines of the spreadsheet instead of writing it on one long
line. This is because if you wrote it on one line, two things would
happen that you would not like: (1) If you printed the conclusion by
reducing the size of the layout of the page so that the entire
spreadsheet would ﬁt onto one page, the print font size for the
entire spreadsheet would be so small that you could not read it
without a magnifying glass, and (2) If you printed the spreadsheet
without reducing the page size layout, it would “dribble over” part
of the conclusion to a separate page all by itself, and your spread-
sheet would not look professional.
Your research study accepted the claim that the average number of outpatients
visits to the clinic during the past 12 months was 3.50 visits. (See Fig. 3.5)

3.2
Hypothesis Testing
One of the important activities of research scientists is that they attempt to “check”
their assumptions about the world by testing these assumptions in the form of
hypotheses.
A typical hypothesis is in the form: “If x , then y.”
Some examples would be:
1. “If we use this new method of conducting this type of procedure in the labora-
tory, the cost of completing this procedure will decrease by 3 percent.”
2. “If we change the way we teach the online Health Care Law course in our
program, then we will obtain a ﬁve percent increase in course enrollment.”
3. “If we change the format for teaching Advanced Research Methods to graduate
students in our MSW program, then their ﬁnal exam scores will increase by
8 percent.”
A hypothesis, then, to a research scientist is a “guess” about what we think is true
in the real world. We can test these guesses using statistical formulas to see if our
predictions come true.
So, in order to perform these statistical tests, we must ﬁrst state our hypotheses
so that we can test our results against our hypotheses to see if our hypotheses match
reality.
So, how do we generate hypotheses in our research?
3.2.1
Hypotheses Always Refer to the Population That You
Are Studying
The ﬁrst step is to understand that our hypotheses always refer to the population of
people or events in a study.
For example, suppose we are interested in evaluating our social work MSW
program by using an in-depth interview with students two months before they are
scheduled to graduate from the program. If we select a random sample of students
to be interviewed, the selected students would be our sample. This sample would
then be used to generalize our ﬁndings to the population of all students scheduled to
graduate in two months from this program.
All of the students scheduled to graduate from this program in two months would
be the population that we are interested in studying, while the speciﬁc students
interviewed in our study would be called the sample from this population.
Since our sample sizes typically contain only a portion of the population we are
interested in studying, we are interested in the results of our sample only insofar as
46
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

the results of our sample can be “generalized” to the population in which we are
really interested.
That is why our hypotheses always refer to the population, and never to the
sample of people or events in our study.
You will recall from Chap. 1 that we used the symbol: X to refer to the mean of
the sample we use in our research study (See Sect. 1.1).
We will use the symbol: μ (the Greek letter “mu”) to refer to the population
mean.
In testing our hypotheses, we are trying to decide which one of two competing
hypotheses about the population mean we should accept given our data set.
3.2.2
The Null Hypothesis and the Research (Alternative)
Hypothesis
These two competing hypotheses are called the null hypothesis and the research
hypothesis.
Statistics textbooks typically refer to the null hypothesis with the notation: H0.
The research hypothesis is typically referred to with the notation: H1, and it is
sometimes called the alternative hypothesis.
Let’s explain ﬁrst what is meant by the null hypothesis and the research
hypothesis:
(1) The null hypothesis is what we accept as true unless we have compelling
evidence that it is not true.
(2) The research hypothesis is what we accept as true whenever we reject the null
hypothesis as true.
This is similar to our legal system in America where we assume that a supposed
criminal is innocent until he or she is proven guilty in the eyes of a jury. Our null
hypothesis is that this defendant is innocent, while the research hypothesis is that he
or she is guilty.
In the great state of Missouri, every license plate has the state slogan: “Show
me.” This means that people in Missouri think of themselves as not gullible enough
to accept everything that someone says as true unless that person’s actions indicate
the truth of his or her claim. In other words, people in Missouri believe strongly that
a person’s actions speak much louder than that person’s words.
Since both the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis cannot both be true,
the task of hypothesis testing using statistical formulas is to decide which one you
will accept as true.
Sometimes in social work research studies, rating scales are used in surveys to
measure people’s attitudes toward an organization’s activities. These rating scales
are typically 5-point, 7-point, or 10-point scales, although other scale values may
also be used.
3.2

47

3.2.2.1
Determining the Null Hypothesis and the Research Hypothesis
When Rating Scales Are Used
The following examples are a way to test the null hypothesis and research hypoth-
esis using rating scales. They illustrate how you would test these hypotheses if you
encountered rating scales on your job.
The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) has more
than 67,000 members who work in a variety of health information settings that
connect clinical, operational, and administrative functions.
Here is a typical example of a 7-point scale that could be used by the American
Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) to obtain feedback from
participants on the value of its annual week-long international conference (see
Fig. 3.6):
So, how do we decide what to use as the null hypothesis and the research
hypothesis whenever rating scales are used?
Objective: To decide on the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis when-
ever rating scales are used.
In order to make this determination, we will use a simple rule:
Rule: Whenever rating scales are used, we will use the “middle” of the scale as the
null hypothesis and the research hypothesis.
In the above example, since 4 is the number in the middle of the scale (i.e., three
numbers are below it, and three numbers are above it), our hypotheses become:
Null hypothesis:
μ ¼ 4
Research hypothesis: μ 6¼ 4
Fig. 3.6 Example of a Rating Scale Item for a Conference (Practical Example)
48
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

In the above rating scale example, if the result of our statistical test for this one
attitude scale item indicates that our population mean is “close to 4,” we say that we
accept the null hypothesis that the AHIMA conference participants were neither
satisﬁed nor dissatisﬁed with the overall quality of the conference.
In the above example, if the result of our statistical test indicates that the
population mean is signiﬁcantly different from 4, we reject the null hypothesis
and accept the research hypothesis by stating either that:
“AHIMA conference participants were signiﬁcantly satisﬁed with the overall
quality of the conference” (this is true whenever our sample mean is signiﬁcantly
greater than our expected population mean of 4).
or
“AHIMA conference participants were signiﬁcantly dissatisﬁed with the overall
quality of the conference” (this is accepted as true whenever our sample mean is
signiﬁcantly less than our expected population mean of 4).
Both of these conclusions cannot be true. We accept one of the hypotheses as
“true” based on the data set in our research study, and the other one as “not true”
based on our data set.
The job of the researcher, then, is to decide which of these two hypotheses, the
null hypothesis or the research hypothesis, he or she will accept as true given the
data set in the research study.
Let’s try some examples of rating scales so that you can practice ﬁguring out
what the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis are for each rating scale.
In the spaces in Fig. 3.7, write in the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis
for the rating scales:
3.2
Hypothesis Testing
49

How did you do?
Here are the answers to these three questions:
1. The null hypothesis is μ ¼ 3, and the research hypothesis is μ 6¼ 3 on this 5-point
scale (i.e. the “middle” of the scale is 3).
2. The null hypothesis is μ ¼ 4, and the research hypothesis is μ 6¼ 4 on this 7-point
scale (i.e., the “middle” of the scale is 4).
3. The null hypothesis is μ ¼ 5.5, and the research hypothesis is μ 6¼ 5.5 on this
10-point scale (i.e., the “middle” of the scale is 5.5 since there are 5 numbers
below 5.5 and 5 numbers above 5.5).
As another example, Webster University, whose main campus is in St. Louis,
Missouri USA, uses a Course Feedback form for student evaluations at the end of
all of its courses which are offered to more than 16,000 students in 60 cities and
11 countries. The Course Feedback form has 12 rating items referring to the
course’s planning and organization and the level of communications between the
instructor and the students. The ratings are summarized and the results given to
instructors after the course is completed. Each of the items is rated on the following
4-point scale:
Fig. 3.7 Examples of Rating Scales for Determining the Null Hypothesis and the Research
Hypothesis
50
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

1 ¼ Very Effective
2 ¼ Effective
3 ¼ Ineffective
4 ¼ Very Ineffective
On this scale, the null hypothesis is: μ ¼ 2.5 and the research hypothesis is:
μ 6¼ 2.5, because there are two numbers below 2.5, and two numbers above 2.5 on
the rating scale. (Note that the scale is scored so that a low score, like a low score in
golf, is a better score.)
Now, let’s discuss the 7 STEPS of hypothesis testing for using the conﬁdence
interval about the mean.
3.2.3
The 7 Steps for Hypothesis-Testing Using
the Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean
Objective: To learn the 7 steps of hypothesis-testing using the conﬁdence
interval about the mean
There are seven basic steps of hypothesis-testing for this statistical test.
3.2.3.1
STEP 1: State the Null Hypothesis and the Research Hypothesis
If you are using numerical scales in your survey, you need to remember that the null
and research hypotheses refer to the “middle” of the numerical scale. For example,
if you are using 7-point scales with 1 ¼ poor and 7 ¼ excellent, these hypotheses
would refer to the middle of these scales and would be:
Null hypothesis H0:
μ ¼ 4
Research hypothesis H1: μ 6¼ 4
3.2.3.2
STEP 2: Select the Appropriate Statistical Test
In this chapter we are studying the conﬁdence interval about the mean, and so we
will select that test.
3.2.3.3
STEP 3: Calculate the Formula for the Statistical Test
You will recall (see Sect. 3.1.5) that the formula for calculating the conﬁdence
interval about the mean is:
3.2
Hypothesis Testing
51

X  t s:e:
ð3:2Þ
We discussed the procedure for computing this formula for the conﬁdence
interval about the mean using Excel earlier in this chapter. The steps involved in
using that formula are:
1. Use Excel’s ¼COUNT function to ﬁnd the sample size.
2. Use Excel’s ¼AVERAGE function to ﬁnd the sample mean, X.
3. Use Excel’s ¼STDEV function to ﬁnd the standard deviation, STDEV.
4. Find the standard error of the mean (s.e.) by dividing the standard deviation
(STDEV) by the square root of the sample size, n.
5. Use Excel’s TINV function to ﬁnd the lower limit of the conﬁdence interval.
6. Use Excel’s TINV function to ﬁnd the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval.
3.2.3.4
STEP 4: Draw a Picture of the Conﬁdence Interval About
the Mean, Including the Mean, the Lower Limit of the Interval,
the Upper Limit of the Interval, and the Reference Value Given
in the Null Hypothesis, H0 (We Will Explain Step 4 Later
in the Chapter)
3.2.3.5
STEP 5: Decide on a Decision Rule
(a) If the reference value is inside the conﬁdence interval, accept the null hypoth-
esis, H0
(b) If the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, reject the null hypoth-
esis, H0, and accept the research hypothesis, H1
3.2.3.6
STEP 6: State the Result of Your Statistical Test
There are two possible results when you use the conﬁdence interval about the mean,
and only one of them can be accepted as “true.” So your result would be one of the
following:
Either: Since the reference value is inside the conﬁdence interval, we accept the
null hypothesis, H0
Or: Since the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, we reject the
null hypothesis, H0, and accept the research hypothesis, H1
52

Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

3.2.3.7
STEP 7: State the Conclusion of Your Statistical Test in Plain
English!
In practice, this is more difﬁcult than it sounds because you are trying to summarize
the result of your statistical test in simple English that is both concise and accurate
so that someone who has never had a statistics course (such as your boss, perhaps)
can understand the conclusion of your test. This is a difﬁcult task, and we will give
you lots of practice doing this last and most important step throughout this book.
Objective: To write the conclusion of the conﬁdence interval about the mean test
Let’s set some basic rules for stating the conclusion of a hypothesis test.
Rule #1: Whenever you reject H0 and accept H1, you must use the word “signiﬁ-
cantly” in the conclusion to alert the reader that this test found an
important result.
Rule #2: Create an outline in words of the “key terms” you want to include in your
conclusion so that you do not forget to include some of them.
Rule #3: Write the conclusion in plain English so that the reader can understand it
even if that reader has never taken a statistics course.
Let’s practice these rules using the outpatient visits Excel spreadsheet that you
created earlier in this chapter (OUTPATIENT3), .but ﬁrst we need to state the
hypotheses for that clinic.
If the clinic wants to claim that the average number of outpatient visits during the
past 12 months was 3.50 visits, the hypotheses would be:
H0 :
μ ¼ 3:50 visits
H1 :
μ 6¼ 3:50 visits
You will remember that the reference value of 3.50 was inside the 95% conﬁ-
dence interval about the mean for your data, so we would accept H0 that the average
number of outpatient visits to the clinic during the past 12 months was 3.50.
Objective: To state the result when you accept H0
Result: Since the reference value of 3.50 is inside the conﬁdence interval, we accept
the null hypothesis, H0.
Let’s try our three rules now:
Objective: To write the conclusion when you accept H0
3.2
Hypothesis Testing
53

Rule #1: Since the reference value was inside the conﬁdence interval, we cannot
use the word “signiﬁcantly” in the conclusion. This is a basic rule we are
using in this chapter for every problem.
Rule #2: The key terms in the conclusion would be:
– outpatient visits
– clinic
– during the past 12 months
– average number
– 3.50 visits
Rule #3: The average number of outpatient visits to the clinic during the past
12 months was 3.50 visits.
The process of writing the conclusion when you accept H0 is relatively straight-
forward since you put into words what you said when you wrote the null hypothesis.
However, the process of stating the conclusion when you reject H0 and accept H1
is more difﬁcult, so let’s practice writing that type of conclusion with three practice
case examples:
Objective: To write the result and conclusion when you reject H0
CASE #1: Suppose that your organization did a time and motion study several
months ago of a speciﬁc laboratory procedure and determined that the
average time required (to the nearest minute) to complete this procedure
was 25 minutes. The hypotheses would be:
H0 :
μ ¼ 25 minutes
H1 :
μ 6¼ 25 minutes
Suppose that your research yields the following conﬁdence interval:
19__________21__________23__________25
lower
limit
Mean
upper
limit
Ref.
Value
Result: Since the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, we reject the
null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis
The three rules for stating the conclusion would be:
Rule #1: We must include the word “signiﬁcantly” since the reference value of 25 is
outside the conﬁdence interval.
Rule #2: The key terms would be:
– laboratory procedure
– average time needed to complete the procedure
54
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

– signiﬁcantly
– either “more than” or “less than”
– and probably closer to
Rule #3: The average laboratory time needed to complete this procedure was
signiﬁcantly less than 25 minutes, and it was probably closer to
21 minutes (i.e., the sample mean).
Note that this conclusion says that the time needed to complete the procedure
was less than 25 minutes because the sample mean was only 21 minutes. Note, also,
that when you ﬁnd a signiﬁcant result by rejecting the null hypothesis, it is not
sufﬁcient to say only: “signiﬁcantly less than 25 minutes,” because that does not tell
the reader “how much less than 25 minutes” the sample mean was from 25 minutes.
To make the conclusion clear, you need to add: “probably closer to 21 minutes”
since the sample mean was only 21 minutes.
CASE #2: A health care center typically has hundreds, if not thousands, of patient
discharges during a given year. If a ﬁnancial ofﬁcer wants to ﬁnd out the
cost of the services provided to a patient, he or she could select a random
sample of the discharges during the past year and use it to estimate the
true cost of patient care. Let’s suppose that the center has determined
that the typical cost of patients treated for the same type of disorder and
who were discharged during the past year has been $5,642.
You want to practice your data interpretation skills on the hypothet-
ical data which produces the conﬁdence interval below:
The hypotheses for this test would be:
H0 :
μ ¼ $5, 642
H1 :
μ 6¼ $5, 642
Essentially, the null hypothesis states that if the obtained average cost for this
sample is not signiﬁcantly different from $5,642, then it is reasonable to assume
that the true cost of this procedure is $5,642.
Suppose that your analysis produced the following conﬁdence interval for this
test:
$5,555______ $5,584______ $5,613______ $5,642 __________

Result: Since the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, we reject the
null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
Rule #1: You must include the word “signiﬁcantly” since the reference value is
outside the conﬁdence interval
3.2
Hypothesis Testing
55

Rule #2: The key terms would be:
– average cost
– patients discharged
– during the past year
– for a speciﬁc disorder
– signiﬁcantly
– less or greater (depending on your result)
Rule #3: The average cost of patients discharged during the past year who were
treated for a speciﬁc disorder was signiﬁcantly less than $5,642, and was
probably closer to $5,584.
Note that you need to use the word “less” since the sample mean of $5,584 was
less than the reference value of $5,642.
CASE #3: The American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) has more than
40,000 healthcare professionals in its international membership. ACHE
is known for its magazine (Healthcare Executive) and for its career
development and public policy activities. ACHE sends a survey to a
sample of its members, and one of the key questions on the survey asks
members whether they agree or disagree that the professional relation-
ships they have formed through ACHE have been important to their
career. Members are asked to rate their opinion on a scale where
Strongly Disagree is scored as 1, Disagree is scored as 2, Neutral is
scored as 3, Agree is scored as 4, and Strongly Agree is scored as 5.
Suppose that you have been asked to use your Excel skills to determine the
opinion of the sampled members.
The hypotheses would be:
H0 :
μ ¼ 3
H1 :
μ 6¼ 3
Suppose that your research produced the following conﬁdence interval for this
survey item:
3__________3.4__________3.6__________3.8______
Ref.
Value
lower
limit
Mean
upper
limit
Result: Since the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, we reject the
null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis
The three rules for stating the conclusion would be:
Rule #1: You must include the word “signiﬁcantly” since the reference value is
outside the conﬁdence interval
56
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

Rule #2: The key terms would be:
– members of ACHE sampled
– professional relationships
– through ACHE membership
– important to their careers
– signiﬁcantly
– agreed or disagreed
Rule #3: The sample of members of ACHE signiﬁcantly agreed that the profes-
sional relationships they developed through ACHE membership have
been important to their careers.
Important note: In this case, you should not use the phrase: “and was probably
closer to 3.6” because words can be accurately used to summarize
the conclusion without needing to refer to any numbers.
If you want a more detailed explanation of the conﬁdence interval about the
mean, see Veney (2003) and Weinbach (2010).
The three practice problems at the end of this chapter will give you additional
practice in stating the conclusion of your result, and this book will include many
more examples that will help you to write a clear and accurate conclusion to your
research ﬁndings.
3.3
Alternative Ways to Summarize the Result
of a Hypothesis Test
It is important for you to understand that in this book we are summarizing an
hypothesis test in one of two ways: (1) We accept the null hypothesis, or (2) We reject
the null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis. We are consistent in the use of
these words so that you can understand the concept underlying hypothesis testing.
However, there are many other ways to summarize the result of an hypothesis
test, and all of them are correct theoretically, even though the terminology differs. If
you are taking a course with a professor who wants you to summarize the results of
a statistical test of hypotheses in language which is different from the language we
are using in this book, do not panic! If you understand the concept of hypothesis
testing as described in this book, you can then translate your understanding to use
the terms that your professor wants you to use to reach the same conclusion.
Statisticians and statistics professors of social work all have their own language
that they like to use to summarize the results of a hypothesis test. There is no one set
of words that these statisticians and professors will ever agree on, and so we have
chosen the one that we believe to be easier to understand in terms of the concept of
hypothesis testing.
To convince you that there are many ways to summarize the results of a
hypothesis test, we present the following quotes from prominent statistics and
research books to give you an idea of the different ways that are possible.
3.3
Alternative Ways to Summarize the Result of a Hypothesis Test
57

3.3.1
Different Ways to Accept the Null Hypothesis
The following quotes are typical of the language used in statistics and research
books when the null hypothesis is accepted:
“The null hypothesis is not rejected.” (Black 2010, p. 310)
“The null hypothesis cannot be rejected.” (McDaniel and Gates 2010, p. 545)
“The null hypothesis . . . claims that there is no difference between groups.” (Salkind 2010,
p. 193)
“The difference is not statistically signiﬁcant.” (McDaniel and Gates 2010, p. 545)
“ . . . the obtained value is not extreme enough for us to say that the difference between
Groups 1 and 2 occurred by anything other than chance.” (Salkind 2010, p. 225)
“If we do not reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that there is not enough statistical
evidence to infer that the alternative (hypothesis) is true.” (Keller 2009, p. 358)
“The research hypothesis is not supported.” (Zikmund and Babin 2010, p. 552)
3.3.2
Different Ways to Reject the Null Hypothesis
The following quotes are typical of the quotes used in statistics and research books
when the null hypothesis is rejected:
“The null hypothesis is rejected.” (McDaniel and Gates 2010, p. 546)
“If we reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that there is enough statistical evidence to
infer that the alternative hypothesis is true.” (Keller 2009, p. 358)
“If the test statistic’s value is inconsistent with the null hypothesis, we reject the null
hypothesis and infer that the alternative hypothesis is true.” (Keller 2009, p. 348)
“Because the observed value . . . is greater than the critical value . . ., the decision is to reject
the null hypothesis.” (Black 2010, p. 359)
“If the obtained value is more extreme than the critical value, the null hypothesis cannot be
accepted.” (Salkind 2010, p. 243)
“The critical t-value . . . must be surpassed by the observed t-value if the hypothesis test is
to be statistically signiﬁcant . . ..” (Zikmund and Babin 2010, p. 567)
“The calculated test statistic . . . exceeds the upper boundary and falls into this rejection
region. The null hypothesis is rejected.” (Weiers 2011, p. 330)
You should note that all of the above quotes are used by statisticians and
professors when discussing the results of a hypothesis test, and so you should not
be surprised if someone asks you to summarize the results of a statistical test using
different language than we are using in this book.

End-of-Chapter Practice Problems

social service program. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was originally devel-
oped on high school juniors and seniors. This scale is in the public domain and

may be used without the need for permission. The scale consists of ten items that
are each scored on the following 4-point scale:
4 ¼ Strongly Agree
3 ¼ Agree
2 ¼ Disagree
1 ¼ Strongly Disagree
If the ten items are summed, the total score can range from 10 to 40 such that the
higher the summed score, the higher the self-esteem. Suppose that you wanted to
test your Excel skills on just one item of this scale: “Item 10: I take a positive
attitude toward myself.” You have decided to create some data from a recently
completed drug treatment program for high school seniors to determine their
measure of self-esteem. Some hypothetical data are presented in Fig. 3.8.

3. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) includes more than
132,000 social workers in the world as its members. NASW has chapters in all
50 states of the USA. The Web site includes a Professional Education and
Training Center that specializes in a continuing education resource center for
its members. The site also includes a Social Work Career center entitled: “Find a
Job” which allows members to post their resume free of charge.
Suppose that you have been asked to design an online survey that can be
emailed to members of NASW who have visited this “Find a Job” site within the
past 90 days. You are in the early stages of survey design, but you have decided
that you do want to include the rating scale below as Item #16 in this online
survey. You want to test your Excel skills on this type of survey, and so you have
created the hypothetical data for this one item that are given in Fig.3.10.

Chapter 4
One-Group t-Test for the Mean
In this chapter, you will learn how to use one of the most popular and most helpful
statistical tests in social work research: the one-group t-test for the mean.
One-group t-tests are used to determine whether there is a signiﬁcant difference
between a sample mean and a population mean.
The formula for the one-group t-test is as follows:
t ¼
X  μ
SX
where
ð4:1Þ
s:e: ¼ S X ¼ Sﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð4:2Þ
This formula asks you to take the sample mean ( X) and subtract the population
mean (μ) from it, and then divide the answer by the standard error of the sample
mean (s.e.). The standard error of the sample mean equals the standard deviation
divided by the square root of n (the sample size). If you want to learn more about
this test, see Veney et al. (2009) and Schneider (2010).
Let’s discuss the 7 STEPS of hypothesis testing using the one-group t-test so that
you can understand how this test is used.
4.1
The 7 STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing
Using the One-Group t-Test
Objective: To learn the 7 steps of hypothesis-testing using the one-group t-test
© Springer International Publishing AG 2017

DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-66221-3_4

Before you can try out your Excel skills on the one-group t-test, you need to
learn the basic steps of hypothesis-testing for this statistical test. There are 7 steps in
this process:
4.1.1
STEP 1: State the Null Hypothesis and the Research
Hypothesis
Recall from Sect. 3.2.2 that the null hypothesis is what we accept as true unless we
have compelling evidence that it is not true, which is generally a hypothesis of no
difference between the sample mean and the population mean. The research
hypothesis, on the other hand, is the alternative, i.e., a hypothesized difference
between the sample mean and the population mean.
If you are using numerical scales in your survey, you need to remember that
these hypotheses refer to the “middle” of the numerical scale. For example, if you
are using 7-point scales with 1 ¼ poor and 7 ¼ excellent, these hypotheses would
refer to the middle of these scales and would be:
Null hypothesis H0:
μ ¼ 4
Research hypothesis H1:
μ 6¼ 4
As a second example, Royse (2010) discusses a Job Satisfaction Scale (JSS) that has
been used with social service professionals. The rating scales for the JSS range from
Very Dissatisﬁed (scored as 1), to Very Satisﬁed (scored as 11). Degree of Satis-
faction is measured for 14 items on the instrument (e.g. Item #4 is: “Opportunities
for promotion”). The hypotheses for testing each item on the JSS would be:
H0 :
μ ¼ 6
H1 :
μ 6¼ 6
Note that these hypotheses are correct because there are ﬁve numbers below
6 (i.e., 1–5), and ﬁve numbers above 6 (i.e., 7–11).
4.1.2
STEP 2: Select the Appropriate Statistical Test
In this chapter we will be studying the one-group t-test, and so we will select
that test.
4.1.3
STEP 3: Decide on a Decision Rule
for the One-Group t-Test
(a) If the absolute value of t is less than the critical value of t , accept the null
hypothesis.
66
4
One-Group t-Test for the Mean

(b) If the absolute value of t is greater than the critical value of t , reject the null
hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
You are probably saying to yourself: “That sounds ﬁne, but how do I ﬁnd the
absolute value of t?”
4.1.3.1
Finding the Absolute Value of a Number
To do that, we need another objective:
Objective: To ﬁnd the absolute value of a number
If you took a basic algebra course in high school, you may remember the concept
of “absolute value.” In mathematical terms, the absolute value of any number is
always that number expressed as a positive number.
For example, the absolute value of 2.35 is +2.35.
And the absolute value of minus 2.35 (i.e. 2.35) is also +2.35.
This becomes important when you are using the t-table in Appendix E of this
book. We will discuss this table later when we get to Step 5 of the one-group t-test
where we explain how to ﬁnd the critical value of t using Appendix E.
4.1.4
STEP 4:Calculate the Formula for the One-Group
t-Test
Objective: To learn how to use the formula for the one-group t-test
The formula for the one-group t-test is as follows:
t ¼
X  μ
SX
where
ð4:1Þ
s:e: ¼ S X ¼ Sﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð4:2Þ
This formula makes the following assumptions about the data (Foster et al. 1998):
(1) The data are independent of each other (i.e., each person or event receives only
one score), (2) the population of the data is normally distributed, and (3) the data
have a constant variance (note that the standard deviation is the square root of the
variance).
4.1
The 7 STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the One-Group t-Test
67

To use this formula, you need to follow these steps:
1. Take the sample mean in your research study and subtract the population mean μ
from it (remember that the population mean for a study involving numerical
rating scales is the “middle” number in the scale).
2. Take your answer from the above step, and divide it by the standard error of the
mean for your research study (remember that you learned how to ﬁnd the
standard error of the mean in Chap. 1; to ﬁnd the standard error of the mean,
just take the standard deviation of your research study and divide it by the square
root of n , where n is the number of people or events in your research study).
3. The number you get after you complete the above step is the value for t that
results when you use the formula stated above.
4.1.5
STEP 5: Find the Critical Value of t
in the t-Table in Appendix E
Objective: To ﬁnd the critical value of t in the t-table in Appendix E
Before we get into an explanation of what is meant by “the critical value of t,” let’s
give you practice ﬁnding the critical value of t by using the t-table in Appendix E.
Keep your ﬁnger on Appendix E as we explain how you need to “read” that
table.
Since the test in this chapter is called the “one-group t-test,” you will use the ﬁrst
column on the left in Appendix E to ﬁnd the critical value of t for your research
study (note that this column is headed: “sample size n”).
To ﬁnd the critical value of t, you go down this ﬁrst column until you ﬁnd the
sample size in your research study, and then you go to the right and read the critical
value of t for that sample size in the critical t column in the table (note that this is the
column that you would use for both the one-group t-test and the 95% conﬁdence
interval about the mean).
For example, if you have 27 people in your research study, the critical value of t
is 2.056.
If you have 38 people in your research study, the critical value of t is 2.026.
If you have more than 40 people in your research study, the critical value of t is
always 1.96.
Note that the “critical t column” in Appendix E represents the value of t that you
need to obtain to be 95% conﬁdent that your results are “signiﬁcant”.
The critical value of t is the value that tells you whether or not you have found a
“signiﬁcant result” in your statistical test.
The t-table in Appendix E represents a series of “bell-shaped normal curves”
(they are called bell-shaped because they look like the outline of the Liberty Bell
that you can see in Philadelphia outside of Independence Hall).
68
4
One-Group t-Test for the Mean

The “middle” of these normal curves is treated as if it were zero point on the
x-axis (the technical explanation of this fact is beyond the scope of this book, but
any good statistics book (e.g. Zikmund and Babin 2010) will explain this concept to
you if you are interested in learning more about it).
Thus, values of t that are to the right of this zero point are positive values that use
a plus sign before them, and values of t that are to the left of this zero point are
negative values that use a minus sign before them. Thus, some values of t are
positive, and some are negative.
However, every statistics book that includes a t-table only reprints the positive
side of the t-curves because the negative side is the mirror image of the positive
side; this means that the negative side contains the exact same numbers as the
positive side, but the negative numbers all have a minus sign in front of them.
Therefore, to use the t-table in Appendix E, you need to take the absolute value
of the t-value you found when you use the t-test formula since the t-table in
Appendix E only has the positive values for t.
Throughout this book, we assume that you want to be 95% conﬁdent in the
results of your statistical tests. Therefore, the value for t in the t-table in Appendix E
tells you whether or not the t-value you obtained when you used the formula for the
one-group t-test is within the 95% interval of the t-curve range.
If the t-value you obtained when you used the formula for the one-group t-test is
inside of the 95% conﬁdence range, we say that the result you found is not
signiﬁcant (note that this is equivalent to accepting the null hypothesis!).
If the t-value you found when you used the formula for the one-group t-test is
outside of this 95% conﬁdence range, we say that you have found a signiﬁcant
result that would be expected to occur less than 5% of the time (note that this is
equivalent to rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the research hypothesis).
4.1.6
STEP 6: State the Result of Your Statistical Test
There are two possible results when you use the one-group t-test, and only one of
them can be accepted as “true.”
Either: Since the absolute value of t that you found in the t-test formula is less than
the critical value of t in Appendix E, you accept the null hypothesis.
Or: Since the absolute value of t that you found in the t-test formula is greater
than the critical value of t in Appendix E, you reject the null hypothesis, and
accept the research hypothesis.
4.1.7
STEP 7: State the Conclusion of Your Statistical Test
in Plain English!
In practice, this is more difﬁcult than it sounds because you are trying to summarize
the result of your statistical test in simple English that is both concise and accurate
4.1
The 7 STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the One-Group t-Test
69

so that someone who has never had a statistics course (such as your boss, perhaps)
can understand the conclusion of your test. This is a difﬁcult task, and we will give
you lots of practice doing this last and most important step throughout this book.
If you have read this far, you are ready to sit down at your computer and perform
the one-group t-test using Excel on some hypothetical data.
Let’s give this a try.
4.2
One-Group t-Test for the Mean
The American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) is an international pro-
fessional society of more than 40,000 healthcare professionals who work in a
variety of healthcare organizations. ACHE is proud of its career development
activities that are provided on its website. One of its most important career
development activities is the posting of possible job-openings at healthcare orga-
nizations so that its members can be made aware of job-openings in the healthcare
industry. Suppose that ACHE has asked its members who access its website to rate
the helpfulness of its Career Services section in notifying members of job-openings
in the healthcare industry, and you have been asked to analyze the resulting data.
The data are based on visitors to the website who used the Career Services section.
Suppose that Item #7 on the survey asked visitors to rate the helpfulness of the
job-posting feature on a 10-point scale where 1 ¼ poor and 10 ¼ excellent.
The survey contains a number of items, but suppose a hypothetical Item #7 is the
one in Fig. 4.1:
Suppose further, that you have decided to analyze the data from members using a
one-group t-test.
Important note: You would need to use this test for each of the survey items
separately.
Suppose that the hypothetical data for Item #7 of the ACHE Website were based
on a sample size of 124 members who had a mean score on this item of 6.58 and a
standard deviation on this item of 2.44.

One-Group t-Test for the Mean

Objective: To analyze the data for each question separately using a one-group
t-test for each survey item.
Create an Excel spreadsheet with the following information:
B11: Null hypothesis:
B14: Research hypothesis:
Note: Remember that when you are using a rating scale item, both the null
hypothesis and the research hypothesis refer to the “middle of the scale.”
For the 10-point scale in this example, the middle of the scale is 5.5 since ﬁve
numbers are below 5.5 (i.e., 1–5) and ﬁve numbers are above 5.5 (i.e. 6–10).
Therefore, the hypotheses for this rating scale item are:
H0 :
μ ¼ 5:5
H1 :
μ 6¼ 5:5
B17:
n
B20:

B23:

71

D26:
compute the standard error using the formula in Chap. 1
D29:
ﬁnd the critical t value of t in the t-table in Appendix E
Now, enter the following formula in cell D32 to ﬁnd the t-test result:
¼(D20  5.5)/D26 (no spaces between symbols)
In Excel, this formula takes the sample mean (D20) and subtracts the population
hypothesized mean of 5.5 from the sample mean, and THEN divides the answer by
the standard error of the mean (D26). Note that you need to enter D20  5.5 with an
open-parenthesis before D20 and a closed-parenthesis after 5.5 so that the answer of
1.08 is THEN divided by the standard error of 0.22 to get the t-test result of 4.93.
Now, use two decimal places for both the s.e. and the t-test result (see Fig. 4.3).

One-Group t-Test for the Mean

Now, write the following sentence in D36:D39 to summarize the result of the
t-test:
D36:
Since the absolute value of t of 4.93 is
D37:
greater than the critical t of 1.96, we
D38:
reject the null hypothesis and accept
D39:
the research hypothesis.
Lastly, write the following sentence in D41:D44 to summarize the conclusion of
the result for Item #7 of the ACHE Survey:
D41:
Members rated the helpfulness of the Career
D42:
Services section of the ACHE Website in its
D43:
helpfulness in notifying members of job-openings
D44:
in the healthcare industry as signiﬁcantly positive.

Save your ﬁle as: career4C
Important note: We have used the term “signiﬁcantly positive” because the mean
rating of 6.58 is on the positive side of the rating scale. We
purposely have not used the term “signiﬁcantly excellent” because
people who speak English do not use that term because something
is either excellent or it is not excellent. Therefore, “signiﬁcantly
positive” is a more correct use of the English language in this type
of rating scale item.
Important note: You are probably wondering why we entered both the result and the
conclusion in separate cells instead of in just one cell. This is
because if you enter them in one cell, you will be very disappointed
when you print out your ﬁnal spreadsheet, because one of two
things will happen that you will not like: (1) if you print the
spreadsheet to ﬁt onto only one page, the result and the conclusion
will force the entire spreadsheet to be printed in such small font
size that you will be unable to read it, or (2) if you do not print the
ﬁnal spreadsheet to ﬁt onto one page, both the result and the
conclusion will “dribble over” onto a second page instead of ﬁtting
the entire spread-sheet onto one page. In either case, your spread-
sheet will not have a “professional look.”
Print the ﬁnal spreadsheet so that it ﬁts onto one page as given in Fig. 4.4. Enter
the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis by hand on your spreadsheet
74

One-Group t-Test for the Mean

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is important for you to understand that “technically” the
above conclusion in statistical terms should state:
“Members rated the helpfulness of the Career Services sec-
tion of the ACHE Website in its helpfulness in notifying
members of job-openings in the healthcare industry as pos-
itive, and this result was probably not obtained by chance.”
However, throughout this book, we are using the term “sig-
niﬁcantly” in writing the conclusion of statistical tests to alert
the reader that the result of the statistical test was probably
not a chance ﬁnding, but instead of writing all of those words
each time, we use the word “signiﬁcantly” as a shorthand to
the longer explanation. This makes it much easier for the
reader to understand the conclusion when it is written “in
plain English,” instead of technical, statistical language.

4.3
Can You Use Either the 95% Conﬁdence Interval
About the Mean OR the One-Group t-Test When
Testing Hypotheses?
You are probably asking yourself:
“It sounds like you could use either the 95% conﬁdence interval about the mean
or the one-group t-test to analyze the results of the types of problems described so
far in this book? Is this a correct statement?”
The answer is a resounding: “Yes!”
Both the conﬁdence interval about the mean and the one-group t-test are often
used in research on the types of problems described so far in this book. Both of these
tests produce the same result and the same conclusion from the same data set!
Both of these tests are explained in this book because some researchers prefer the
conﬁdence interval about the mean test, while others prefer the one-group t-test, and
still others prefer to use both tests on the same data to make their results and
conclusions clearer to the reader of their research reports. Since we do not know
which of these tests your researcher prefers, we have explained both of them so that
you are competent in the use of both tests in the analysis of statistical data.
Now, let’s try your Excel skills on the one-group t-test on the three problems at
the end of this chapter.

One-Group t-Test for the Mean

Chapter 5
Two-Group t-Test of the Difference
of the Means for Independent Groups
Up until now in this book, you have been dealing with the situation in which you
have had only one group of people or events in your research study and only one
measurement “number” on each of these people or events. We will now change
gears and deal with the situation in which you are measuring two groups instead of
only one group.
Whenever you have two completely different groups of people or events (i.e., no
one person or event is in both groups, but every person or event is measured on only
one variable to produce one “number” for each person or event), we say that the two
groups are “independent of one another.” This chapter deals with just that situation.
Two assumptions underly the two-group t-test (Wheater and Cook 2000):
(1) both groups are sampled from a normal population, and (2) the variances of
the two populations are approximately equal. Note that the standard deviation is
merely the square root of the variance. (There are different formulas to use when
each person or event is measured twice to create two groups of data, and this
situation is called “dependent,” but those formulas are beyond the scope of this
book.) This book only deals with two groups that are independent of one another so
that no person or event is in both groups of data.
When you test for the difference between the means for two groups, it is
important to remember that there are two different formulas that you need to use
depending on the sample sizes of the two groups:
(1) Use Formula #1 in this chapter when both of the groups have a sample size
greater than 30, and
(2) Use Formula #2 in this chapter when either one group, or both groups, have a
sample size less than 30.
We will illustrate both of these situations in this chapter.
But, ﬁrst, we need to understand the steps involved in hypothesis-testing when
two groups are involved before we dive into the formulas for these tests.

5.1
The 9 STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using
the Two-Group t-Test
Objective: To learn the 9 steps of hypothesis-testing using two groups of people
or events and the two-group t-test
You will see that these steps parallel the steps used in the previous chapter that dealt
with the one-group t-test, but there are some important differences between the
steps that you need to understand clearly before we dive into the formulas for the
two-group t-test.
5.1.1
STEP 1: Name One Group, Group 1, and the Other
Group, Group 2
The formulas used in this chapter will use the numbers 1 and 2 to distinguish
between the two groups. If you deﬁne which group is Group 1 and which group is
Group 2, you can use these numbers in your computations without having to write
out the names of the groups.
For example, if you were testing entering college freshmen who said they
wanted to major in social work to see if there were gender differences in their
SAT-Math scores as high school seniors, you could call the groups: “Freshmen
Males” and “Freshmen Females,” but this would require you to write out the words
“Freshmen Males” and ”Freshmen Females” whenever you wanted to refer to one
of these groups. If you call the “Freshmen Males” group, Group 1, and the
“Freshmen Females” group, Group 2, this makes it much easier to refer to the
groups because it saves writing time.
Note, also, that it is completely arbitrary which group you name Group 1, and
which Group you name Group 2. You will achieve the same result and the same
conclusion from the formulas however you decide to deﬁne these two groups.
5.1.2
STEP 2: Create a Table That Summarizes the Sample
Size, Mean Score, and Standard Deviation of Each
Group
This step makes it easier for you to make sure that you are using the correct numbers
in the formulas for the two-group t-test. If you get the numbers “mixed-up,” your
entire formula work will be incorrect and you will botch the problem terribly.
82
5
Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

For example, suppose that you collected data on entering freshmen who said that
they planned to major in social work (BSW) and found that the Freshmen Males
group had 57 men in it and their SAT-Math scores averaged 610 with a standard
deviation of 120, while the Freshmen Females group had 46 females in it and their
SAT-Math scores averaged 640 with a standard deviation of 110.
The formulas for analyzing these data to determine if there was a signiﬁcant
different in the average SAT-Math score for Freshmen Males versus Freshmen
Females require you to use six numbers correctly: the sample size, the mean, and
the standard deviation of each of the two groups. All six of these numbers must be
used correctly in the formulas if you are to analyze the data correctly.
If you create a table to summarize these data, a good example of the table, using
both Step 1 and Step 2, would be the data presented in Fig. 5.1:
If you decide to name Group 1 the Freshmen Males group and Group 2 the
Freshmen Females group, the following table would place the six numbers from
your research study into the proper cells of the table as in Fig. 5.2:
You can now use the formulas for the two-group t-test with more conﬁdence that
the six numbers will be placed in the proper place in the formulas.
Note that you could just as easily name Group 1 the Freshmen Females group
and Group 2 the Freshmen Males group; it makes no difference how you decide to
name the two groups; this decision is up to you and you will get the same result
from your statistical test no matter which decision you make.

The 9 STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the Two-Group t-Test
83

5.1.3
STEP 3: State the Null Hypothesis and the Research
Hypothesis for the Two-Group t-Test
If you have completed Step 1 above, this step is very easy because the null
hypothesis and the research hypothesis will always be stated in the same way for
the two-group t-test. The null hypothesis states that the population means of the two
groups are equal, while the research hypothesis states that the population means of
the two groups are not equal. In notation format, this becomes:
H0 :
μ1 ¼ μ2
H1 :
μ1 6¼ μ2
You can now see that this notation is much simpler than having to write out the
names of the two groups in all of your formulas.
5.1.4
STEP 4: Select the Appropriate Statistical Test
Since this chapter deals with the situation in which you have two groups but only
one measurement on each person or event in each group, we will use the two-group
t-test throughout this chapter.
5.1.5
STEP 5: Decide on a Decision Rule for the Two-Group
t-Test
The decision rule is exactly the same as what it was in the previous chapter (see
Sect. 4.1.3) when we dealt with the one-group t-test.
(a) If the absolute value of t is less than the critical value of t, accept the null
hypothesis.
(b) If the absolute value of t is greater than the critical value of t, reject the null
hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
Since you learned how to ﬁnd the absolute value of t in the previous chapter (see
Sect. 4.1.3.1), you can use that knowledge in this chapter.
5.1.6
STEP 6: Calculate the Formula for the Two-Group
t-Test
Since we are using two different formulas in this chapter for the two-group t-test
depending on the sample size in the two groups, we will explain how to use those
formulas later in this chapter.
84

Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

5.1.7
STEP 7: Find the Critical Value of t
in the t-Table in Appendix E
In the previous chapter where we were dealing with the one-group t-test, you found
the critical value of t in the t-table in Appendix E by ﬁnding the sample size for the
one group in the ﬁrst column of the table, and then reading the critical value of t
across from it on the right in the “critical t column” in the table (see Sect. 4.1.5).
This process is fairly simple once you have had some practice in doing this step.
However, for the two-group t-test, the procedure for ﬁnding the critical value of t
is more complicated because you have two different groups in your study, and they
often have different sample sizes in each group.
To use Appendix E correctly in this chapter, you need to learn how to ﬁnd the
“degrees of freedom” for your study. We will discuss that process now.
5.1.7.1
Find the Degrees of Freedom (df) for the Two-Group t-Test
Objective: To ﬁnd the degrees of freedom for the two-group t-test and to use it to
ﬁnd the critical value of t in the t-table in Appendix E
The mathematical explanation of “degrees of freedom” is beyond the scope of this
book, but you can ﬁnd out more about this concept by reading any good statistics
book (e.g. Keller 2009 or Bowers 2008). For our purposes, you can easily under-
stand how to ﬁnd degrees of freedom and to use it to ﬁnd the critical value of t in
Appendix E. The formula for the degrees of freedom (df) is:
degrees of freedom ¼ df ¼ n1 þ n2  2
ð5:1Þ
In other words, you add the sample size for Group 1 to the sample size for Group
2 and then subtract 2 from this total to get the number of degrees of freedom to use
in Appendix E.
Take a look at Appendix E.
Instead of using the ﬁrst column as we did in the one-group t-test that is based on
the sample size, n, of one group, we need to use the second-column of this table
(df) to ﬁnd the critical value of t for the two-group t-test.
For example, if you had 13 people in Group 1 and 17 people in Group 2, the
degrees of freedom would be: 13 + 17  2 ¼ 28, and the critical value of t would be
2.048 since you look down the second column which contains the degrees of
freedom until you come to the number 28, and then read 2.048 in the “critical t
column” in the table to ﬁnd the critical value of t when df ¼ 28.
As a second example, if you had 52 people in Group 1 and 57 people in Group
2, the degrees of freedom would be: 52 + 57  2 ¼ 107. When you go down the
5.1
The 9 STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the Two-Group t-Test
85

second column in Appendix E for the degrees of freedom, you ﬁnd that once you go
beyond the degrees of freedom equal to 39, the critical value of t is always 1.96, and
that is the value you would use for the critical t with this example.
5.1.8
STEP 8: State the Result of Your Statistical Test
The result follows the exact same result format that you found for the one-group
t-test in the previous chapter (see Sect. 4.1.6):
Either: Since the absolute value of t that you found in the t-test formula is less than
the critical value of t in Appendix E, you accept the null hypothesis.
Or: Since the absolute value of t that you found in the t-test formula is greater
than the critical value of t in Appendix E, you reject the null hypothesis and
accept the research hypothesis.
5.1.9
STEP 9: State the Conclusion of Your Statistical Test
in Plain English!
Writing the conclusion for the two-group t-test is more difﬁcult than writing the
conclusion for the one-group t-test because you have to decide what the difference
was between the two groups.
When you accept the null hypothesis, the conclusion is simple to write: “There is
no difference between the two groups in the variable that was measured.”
But when you reject the null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis, you
need to be careful about writing the conclusion so that it is both accurate and
concise.
Let’s give you some practice in writing the conclusion of a two-group t-test.
5.1.9.1
Writing the Conclusion of the Two-Group t-Test When You
Accept the Null Hypothesis
Objective: To write the conclusion of the two-group t-test when you have
accepted the null hypothesis.
The American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) is an international pro-
fessional organization with more than 40,000 members. ACHE’s most important
educational program is an annual Congress on Healthcare Leadership which typi-
cally has more than 4,000 participants. Suppose you have been asked to design a
survey that can be emailed to participants after the Congress has ended to determine
86
5
Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

the attitude of participants toward the many activities of the Congress. One key item
that you are sure that you want to include is an item asking participants if they
would recommend attending next year’s Congress to their colleagues. Item #10 of
this survey is given in Fig. 5.3.
Suppose further, that you have decided to analyze the data from the Survey
comparing the attitudes of men who attended the Congress to those of women who
attended the Congress by using the two-group t-test.
Important note: You would need to use this test for each of the Survey items
separately.
Suppose that the hypothetical data for Item #10 was based on a sample size of
124 Males who had a mean score on this item of 6.58 and a standard deviation on
this item of 2.44. Suppose that you also had data from 86 Females who had a mean
score of 6.45 with a standard deviation of 1.86.
We will explain later in this chapter how to produce the results of the two-group
t-test using its formulas, but, for now, let’s “cut to the chase” and create a table for
these data (see Fig. 5.4):
degrees of freedom:
208
critical t:
1.96 (in Appendix E)
t-test formula:
0.44 (when you use your calculator!)
Result:
Since the absolute value of 0.44 is less than the critical t of
1.96, we accept the null hypothesis.
Conclusion:
There was no difference between Males and Females in their
likelihood of recommending that colleagues attend next
year’s Congress.
Now, let’s see what happens when you reject the null hypothesis (H0) and accept
the research hypothesis (H1).

for Item #10 for Accepting
the Null Hypothesis

The 9 STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the Two-Group t-Test
87

5.1.9.2
Writing the Conclusion of the Two-Group t-Test When You
Reject the Null Hypothesis and Accept the Research Hypothesis
Objective: To write the conclusion of the two-group t-test when you have
rejected the null hypothesis and accepted the research hypothesis
Let’s continue with this same example, but with the result that we reject the null
hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
Let’s assume that this time you have data on 85 Males and their mean score on
Item #10 was 7.26 with a standard deviation of 2.35. Let’s further suppose that you
also have data on 48 Females and their mean score on this question was 4.37 with a
standard deviation of 3.26. Let’s call Males, Group 1, and Females, Group 2.
Without going into the details of the formulas for the two-group t-test, these data
in a table would produce the following result and conclusion based on Fig. 5.5:
Null Hypothesis:
μ1 ¼ μ2
Research Hypothesis: μ1 6¼ μ2
degrees of freedom:
131
critical t:
1.96 (in Appendix E)
t-test formula:
5.40 (when you use your calculator!)
Result:
Since the absolute value of 5.40 is greater than the critical t
of 1.96, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the
research hypothesis.
Now, you need to write a conclusion comparing Males and Females on their
likelihood of recommending to colleagues that they attend next year’s Congress
using the following rule:
Rule: To summarize the conclusion of the two-group t-test, just compare the means
of the two groups, and be sure to use the word “signiﬁcantly” in your
conclusion if you rejected the null hypothesis and accepted the research
hypothesis.
A good way to prepare to write the conclusion of the two-group t-test when you
are using a rating scale is to place the mean scores of the two groups on a drawing of
the scale so that you can visualize the difference between the mean scores. For
example, using our ACHE Congress example from above, you would draw this
“picture” of the scale in Fig. 5.6:
Fig. 5.5 Worksheet Data
for Item #10 for Obtaining a
Signiﬁcant Difference
between Males and Females
88
5
Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

This drawing tells you visually that Males had a higher average rating than
Females on Item #10 (7.26 vs. 4.37). And, since you rejected the null hypothesis and
accepted the research hypothesis, you know that you have found a signiﬁcant
difference between the two mean scores.
So, our conclusion needs to contain the following key words:
– Males
– Females
– likelihood of recommending that colleagues attend next year’s Congress
– signiﬁcantly
– more likely or less likely
– either (7.26 vs. 4.37) or (4.37 vs. 7.26)
We can use these key words to write either of two conclusions, which are
logically identical:
Either: Males were signiﬁcantly more likely than Females to recommend that their
colleagues attend next year’s Congress (7.26 vs. 4.37).
Or: Females were signiﬁcantly less likely than Males to recommend that their
colleagues attend next year’s Congress (4.37 vs. 7.26).
Both of these conclusions are accurate, so you can decide which one you want to
write. It is your choice.
Also, note that the mean scores in parentheses at the end of these conclusions
must match the sequence of the two groups in your conclusion. For example, if you
say that: “Males were signiﬁcantly more likely than Females,” the end of this
conclusion should be: (7.26 vs. 4.37) since you mentioned Males ﬁrst, and Females
second.
Alternately, if you wrote that: “Females were signiﬁcantly less likely than
Males,” the end of this conclusion should be: (4.37 vs. 7.26) since you mentioned
Females ﬁrst, and Males second.
Putting the two mean scores at the end of your conclusion saves the reader from
having to turn back to the table in your research report to ﬁnd these mean scores to
see how far apart they were.
Now, let’s discuss FORMULA #1 that deals with the situation in which both
groups have a sample size greater than 30.
Fig. 5.6 Example of Drawing a “Picture” of the Means of the Two Groups on the Rating Scale
5.1
The 9 STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the Two-Group t-Test
89

Objective: To use FORMULA #1 for the two-group t-test when both groups
have a sample size greater than 30
5.2
Formula #1: Both Groups Have a Sample Size Greater
Than 30
The ﬁrst formula we will discuss will be used when you have two groups with a
sample size greater than 30 in each group and one measurement on each member in
each group. This formula for the two-group t-test is:
t ¼
X1  X2
SX1X2
ð5:2Þ
where S X1 X2 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
S12
n1
þ S22
n2
s
ð5:3Þ
and where degrees of freedom ¼ df ¼ n1 þ n2  2
ð5:1Þ
This formula looks daunting when you ﬁrst see it, but let’s explain some of the parts
of this formula:
We have explained the concept of “degrees of freedom” earlier in this chapter,
and so you should be able to ﬁnd the degrees of freedom needed for this formula in
order to ﬁnd the critical value of t in Appendix E.
In the previous chapter, the formula for the one-group t-test was the following:
t ¼
X  μ
SX
ð4:1Þ
where s:e: ¼ SX ¼ Sﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð4:2Þ
For the one-group t-test, you found the mean score and subtracted the population
mean from it, and then divided the result by the standard error of the mean (s.e.) to
get the result of the t-test. You then compared the t-test result to the critical value of
t to see if you either accepted the null hypothesis, or rejected the null hypothesis and
accepted the research hypothesis.
The two-group t-test requires a different formula because you have two groups,
each with a mean score on some variable. You are trying to determine whether to
accept the null hypothesis that the population means of the two groups are equal
(in other words, there is no difference statistically between these two means), or
whether the difference between the means of the two groups is “sufﬁciently large”
that you would accept that there is a signiﬁcant difference in the mean scores of the
two groups.
90
5
Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

The numerator of the two-group t-test asks you to ﬁnd the difference between the
means of the two groups:
X1  X2
ð5:4Þ
The next step in the formula for the two-group t-test is to divide the answer you
get when you subtract the two means by the standard error of the difference of the
two means, and this is a different standard error of the mean than the one you found
for the one-group t-test because there are two means in the two-group t-test.
The standard error of the mean when you have two groups is called the “standard
error of the difference of the means.” This formula looks less scary when you break
it down into four steps:
1. Square the standard deviation of Group 1, and divide this result by the sample
size for Group 1 (n1).
2. Square the standard deviation of Group 2, and divide this result by the sample
size for Group 2 (n2).
3. Add the results of the above two steps to get a total score.
4. Take the square root of this total score to ﬁnd the standard error of the difference
of the means between the two groups, SX1X2 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
S12
n1
þ S22
n2
s
This last step is the one that gives students the most difﬁculty when they are
ﬁnding this standard error using their calculator, because they are in such a hurry to
get to the answer that they forget to carry the square root sign down to the last step,
and thus get a larger number than they should for the standard error.
5.2.1
An Example of Formula #1 for the Two-Group t-Test
Now, let’s use Formula #1 in a situation in which both groups have a sample size
greater than 30.
Suppose that a university that offered a Master’s degree in Social Work (MSW)
wanted to obtain feedback from students at the end of a course in Managing Human
Resources from the previous semester to determine if there was a gender difference
in the students’ opinions of the course. Item #12 of the Course Evaluation Form
asked the graduate students for their overall rating of the quality of the course using
a 100-point scale. This rating item is given in Fig. 5.7.
5.2
Formula #1: Both Groups Have a Sample Size Greater Than 30
91

Suppose you collect these evaluation forms and determine (using your new
Excel skills) that the 52 Males in Group 1 had a mean score of 55 with a standard
deviation of 7, while the 57 Females in Group 2 had a mean score of 64 with a
standard deviation of 13 on Item #12.
Note that the two-group t-test does not require that both groups have the same
sample size. This is another way of saying that the two-group t-test is “robust”
(a fancy term that statisticians like to use).
Your data then produce the following table in Fig. 5.8:
Create an Excel spreadsheet, and enter the following information:
B3:

Now, widen column B so that it is twice as wide as column A, and center the six

Let’s “break this formula down into pieces” to reduce the chance of making a
mistake by entering the following information into the cells below.
B13:

You now need to compute the values of the above formulas in the following
cells:
D13: the result of the formula needed to compute cell B13 (use two decimals)
D16: the result of the formula needed to compute cell B16 (use two decimals)
D19: the result of the formula needed to compute cell B19 (use two decimals)
D22: ¼SQRT(D19) (use two decimals)
This formula should give you a standard error (s.e.) of 1.98.
D25: 1.96
(Since df ¼ n1 + n2  2, this gives df ¼ 109  2 ¼ 107, and the critical t is,
therefore, 1.96 in Appendix E.)

D28: ¼(D4–D5)/D22 (use 2 decimals; no spaces between symbols)
This formula should give you a value for the t-test of: 4.55.
Next, check to see if you have rounded off all ﬁgures in D13:D28 to two decimal
places (see Fig. 5.11).
Now, write the following sentence in D31 to D34 to summarize the result of the

Save your ﬁle as:

Important note: You are probably wondering why we entered both the result and the
conclusion in separate cells instead of in just one cell. This is
because if you enter them in one cell, you will be very disappointed
when you print out your ﬁnal spreadsheet, because one of two
things will happen that you will not like: (1) if you print the
spreadsheet to ﬁt onto only one page, the result and the conclusion
will force the entire spreadsheet to be printed in such small font
size that you will be unable to read it, or (2) if you do not print the
ﬁnal spreadsheet to ﬁt onto one page, both the result and the
conclusion will “dribble over” onto a second page instead of ﬁtting
the entire spreadsheet onto one page. In either case, your spread-
sheet will not have a “professional look.”
Print this ﬁle so that it ﬁts onto one page, and write by hand the null hypothesis
and the research hypothesis on your printout.
The ﬁnal spreadsheet appears in Fig. 5.12.

Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

Now, let’s use the second formula for the two-group t-test which we use
whenever either one group, or both groups, have a sample size less than 30.
Objective: To use Formula #2 for the two-group t-test when one or both groups
have a sample size less than 30
Now, let’s look at the case when one or both groups have a sample size less than
30.

5.3
Formula #2: One or Both Groups Have a Sample Size
Less Than 30
We would use Formula #2 when the underlying population standard deviations are
unknown, but are presumed to be equal.
Suppose that a healthcare administrator at a multi-institutional healthcare center
wanted to determine the average number of days it took to transfer patients from
two of its health care facilities to long-term care facilities after the patients were
ready for discharge. Suppose, further, that the administrator asks you to take a
random sample of transfer patients from both FACILITY A and FACILITY B over
the past three months. You decide to try out your new Excel skills on a small sample
of this type of patient on the hypothetical data given in Fig. 5.13:
Fig. 5.13 Worksheet Data for Delay in Transfer Comparisons (Practical Example)

Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

Let’s re-name FACILITY A Group 1, and re-name FACILITY B Group 2.
Null hypothesis:
μ1 ¼ μ2
Research hypothesis: μ1 6¼ μ2
Note: Since both groups have a sample size less than 30, you need to use Formula
#2 in the following steps:
Create an Excel spreadsheet, and enter the following information:

FACILITY B
B5:

C25: 16
Now, enter the other ﬁgures into this table. Be sure to double-check all of your
ﬁgures. If you have only one incorrect ﬁgure, you will not be able to obtain the
correct answer to this problem.
Now, widen columns B and C so that all of the information ﬁts inside the cells.
To do this, click on both letters B and C at the top of these columns on your
spreadsheet to highlight all of the cells in columns B and C. Then, move the mouse

cross sign and drag the sign to the right until you can read all of the words on your

width.
Next, center all information in the table except the top title by using the
following steps:
Left-click your mouse and highlight cells B4:C25. Then, click on the bottom

Now you need to use your Excel skills from Chap. 1 to ﬁll in the sample sizes (n),
the means, and the standard deviations (STDEV) in the Table in cells F10:H11. Be
sure to double-check your work or you will not be able to obtain the correct answer
to this problem if you have only one incorrect ﬁgure! Round off the means and
standard deviations to zero decimal places and center these six ﬁgures within their
cells.
Since both groups have a sample size less than 30, you need to use Formula #2
for the t-test for the difference of the means of two independent samples.

You now need to use your Excel skills to compute the values of the above
formulas in the following cells:
H14:
the result of the formula needed to compute cell E14 ( use two decimals)
H16:
the result of the formula needed to compute cell E16 (use two decimals)
H18:
the result of the formula needed to compute cell E18
H20:
the result of the formula needed to compute cell E20 (use two decimals)
H23:
¼SQRT(((H14 + H16)/H18)*H20) (no spaces between symbols)
Note the three open-parentheses after SQRT, and the three closed parentheses
on the right side of this formula. You need three open parentheses and three closed
parentheses in this formula or the formula will not work correctly.
The above formula gives a standard error of the difference of the means equal to
0.97 (two decimals) in cell H23.

Enter the critical t value from the t-table in Appendix E in this cell using

H29:
¼(G10–G11)/H23 (no spaces between symbols)
Note that you need an open-parenthesis before G10 and a closed-parenthesis
after G11 so that this answer of 5 is THEN divided by the standard error of the
difference of the means of 0.97, to give a t-test value of 4.57. Use two decimal
places for the t-test result (see Fig. 5.16).
Now write the following sentence in C32 to C33 to summarize the result of the
study:
C32:
Since the absolute value of 4.57 is greater than the critical t of 2.024,

Chapter 6
Correlation and Simple Linear Regression
There are many different types of “correlation coefﬁcients,” but the one we will use
in this book is the Pearson product-moment correlation which we will call: r.
6.1
What Is a “Correlation?”
Basically, a correlation is a number between 1 and +1 that summarizes the
relationship between two variables, which we will call X and Y.
A correlation can be either positive or negative. A positive correlation means
that as X increases, Y increases. A negative correlation means that as X increases, Y
decreases. In statistics books, this part of the relationship is called the direction of
the relationship (i.e., it is either positive or negative).
The correlation also tells us the magnitude of the relationship between X and
Y. As the correlation approaches closer to +1, we say that the relationship is strong
and positive.
As the correlation approaches closer to 1, we say that the relationship is strong
and negative.
A zero correlation means that there is no relationship between X and Y. This
means that neither X nor Y can be used as a predictor of the other.
A good way to understand what a correlation means is to see a “picture” of the
scatterplot of data points produced in a chart. Let’s suppose that you want to know if
variable X can be used to predict variable Y. We will place the predictor variable X
on the x-axis (the horizontal axis of a chart) and the dependent (criterion) variable Y
on the y-axis (the vertical axis of a chart). Suppose, further, that you have collected
data given in the scatterplots below (see Fig. 6.1 through Fig. 6.6).
Figure 6.1 shows the scatterplot for a perfect positive correlation of r ¼ +1.0.
This means that you can perfectly predict each y-value from each x-value because
the data points move “upward-and-to-the-right” along a perfectly-ﬁtting straight
line (see Fig. 6.1)

DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-66221-3_6
109

Figure 6.2 shows the scatterplot for a moderately positive correlation of r ¼ +54.
This means that each x-value can predict each y-value moderately well because you
can draw a picture of a “football” around the outside of the data points that move
upward-and-to-the-right, but not along a straight line (see Fig. 6.2).
Figure 6.3 shows the scatterplot for a low, positive correlation of r ¼ +.09. This
means that each x-value is a poor predictor of each y-value because the “picture”
you could draw around the outside of the data points approaches a circle in shape
(see Fig. 6.3)

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

We have not shown a Figure of a zero correlation because it is easy to imagine
what it looks like as a scatterplot. A zero correlation of r ¼ .00 means that there is
no relationship between X and Y and the “picture” drawn around the data points
would be a perfect circle in shape, indicating that you cannot use X to predict Y
because these two variables are not correlated with one another.
Figure 6.4 shows the scatterplot for a low, negative correlation of r ¼ .09
which means that each X is a poor predictor of Y in an inverse relationship,
meaning that as X increases, Y decreases (see Fig. 6.4). In this case, it is a negative
correlation because the “football” you could draw around the data points slopes
down and to the right.

What Is a “Correlation?”
111

Figure 6.5 shows the scatterplot for a moderate, negative correlation of r ¼ .54
which means that X is a moderately good predictor of Y, although there is an
inverse relationship between X and Y (i.e., as X increases, Y decreases; see
Fig. 6.5). In this case, it is a negative correlation because the “football” you could
draw around the data points slopes down and to the right.
Figure 6.6 shows a perfect negative correlation of r ¼ 1.0 which means that X
is a perfect predictor of Y, although in an inverse relationship such that as X
increases, Y decreases. The data points ﬁt perfectly along a downward-sloping
straight line (see Fig. 6.6)

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Let’s explain the formula for computing the correlation r so that you can
understand where the number summarizing the correlation came from.
In order to help you to understand where the correlation number that ranges from
1.0 to +1.0 comes from, we will walk you through the steps involved in using the
formula as if you were using a calculator. This is the one time in this book that we
will ask you to use your calculator to ﬁnd a correlation. Knowing how a correlation
is computed step-by-step will give you the opportunity to understand how the
formula works in practice.
To do that, let’s create a situation in which you need to ﬁnd the correlation
between two variables.
Suppose you wanted to ﬁnd out if there was a relationship between high school
grade-point average (HSGPA) and freshman GPA (FROSH GPA) for Social Work
majors at a major university. You have decided to call HSGPA the X-variable (i.e.,
the predictor variable) and FROSH GPA as the Y-variable (i.e., the criterion
variable) in your analysis. To test your Excel skills, you take a random sample of
freshmen Social Work majors at the end of their freshman year and record their
GPA. The hypothetical data for eight students appear in Fig. 6.7. (Note: We are
using only one decimal place for the GPAs in this example to simplify the mathe-
matical computations).
Notice also that we have used Excel to ﬁnd the sample size for both variables, X
and Y, and the MEAN and STDEV of both variables. (You can practice your Excel
skills by seeing if you get the same results when you create an Excel spreadsheet for
these data.)
Now, let’s use the above table to compute the correlation r between HSGPA and
FROSH GPA using your calculator.

to understand how to compute the correlation r.

The nine steps are as follows:

For each student, take the HSGPA and subtract the meanHSGPA for the 8 stu-
dents and call this X  X(For example, for student # 6, this would
be:2.6  2.86)
0.26
Note: With your calculator, this difference is 0.26, but whenExcel uses 16 dec-
imal places for every computation,this result could be slightly different for
each student
4
For each student, take the FRGPA and subtract the meanFRGPA for the 8 stu-
dents and call this Y  Y(For example, for student # 6, this would
be:2.3  2.74)
0.44

Then, for each student, multiply (X  X) times (Y  Y)For example, for student
#6 this would be:(0.26)  (0.44)
+0.1144
6
Add the results of (X  X) times (Y  Y) for the 8 students
+1.09
Steps 1–6 would produce the Excel table given in Fig. 6.8.

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Notice that when Excel multiplies a negative number by a negative number, the
result is a positive number (for example for student #7: (0.46)  (0.64) ¼ +0.29.
And when Excel multiplies a negative number by a positive number, the result is a
negative number (for example for student #1: (0.06)  (+0.16) ¼ 0.01).
Note: Excel computes all calculations to 16 decimal places. So, when you check
your work with a calculator, you may get a slightly different answer than
Excel’s answer.
For example, when you compute the answer for student #2:
(X  X)  (Y  Y) for student #2, if you use two decimal places, your calculator
gives:
0:36
ð
Þ  þ0:06
ð
Þ ¼ 0:0216
ð6:2Þ
As you can see from the table, Excel’s answer is 0.02 which is really more
accurate because Excel uses 16 decimal places for every number, even though only
two decimal places are shown in Fig. 6.8.
You should also note that when you do Step 6, you have to be careful to add all of
the positive numbers ﬁrst to get +1.10 and then add all of the negative numbers
second to get 0.03, so that when you subtract these two numbers you get +1.07 as
your answer to Step 6. When you do these computations using Excel, this total
ﬁgure will be +1.09 because Excel carries every number and computation out to
16 decimal places which is more accurate than your calculator.
Step
7
Multiply the answer for step 2 above by the answer for step 6(0.14286  1.09)
0.1557
8
Multiply the STDEV of X times the STDEV of Y(0.48  0.39)
0.1872
9
Finally, divide the answer from step 7 by the answer from step 8(0.1557
divided by 0.1872)
+0.83
Fig. 6.8 Worksheet for Computing the Correlation, r
6.1
What Is a “Correlation?”
115

This number of 0.83 is the correlation between HSGPA (X) and FRGPA (Y) for
these 8 students. The number +0.83 means that there is a strong, positive correlation
between these two variables. That is, as HSGPA increases, FRGPA increases. For a
more detailed discussion of correlation, see Weinbach and Grinnell (2010) and
Rosenthal (2012).
You could also use the results presented in Fig. 6.8 in the formula for computing
the correlation r in the following way:
correlation r ¼

When you use Excel for these computations, you obtain a slightly different
correlation of +0.82 because Excel uses 16 decimal places for all numbers and
computations and is, therefore, more accurate than your calculator.
Now, let’s discuss how you can use Excel to ﬁnd the correlation between two
variables in a much simpler, and much faster, fashion than using your calculator.
6.2
Using Excel to Compute a Correlation Between
Two Variables
Objective: To use Excel to ﬁnd the correlation between two variables
Suppose that the ﬁnancial manager of a clinic has asked you to determine the
relationship between the number of visits per week to the clinic and the number of
laboratory tests run that same week in the clinic.
To test your Excel skills, you have organized the resulting data into a table in
which the number of visits to the clinic for each week over the past three months
was recorded along with the number of lab tests run for that same week. The
hypothetical data appear in Fig. 6.9.
116

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

You want to determine if there is a relationship between the number of visits to
the clinic each week and the number of lab tests run that same week, and you decide
to use a correlation to determine this relationship. Let’s call the visits to the clinic as
the predictor, X, and the number of lab tests as the criterion, Y.
Create an Excel spreadsheet with the following information:
A3:
CLINIC VISITS vs. LAB TESTS
B5:
Is there a relationship between the number of visits to the clinic in a week and
B6:
the number of laboratory tests run that week by the clinic?
B8:
CLINIC VISITS
C8:
LAB TESTS
B9:

C9:
90
Next, change the width of Columns B and C so that the information ﬁts inside the
cells.
Now, complete the remaining ﬁgures in the table given above so that B20 is
85 and C20 is 160. (Be sure to double-check your ﬁgures to make sure that they are
correct!) Then, center the information in all of these cells.

Next, deﬁne the “name” to the range of data from B9:B20 as:
VISITS
We discussed earlier in this book (see Sect. 1.4.4) how to “name a range of data,”
but here is a reminder of how to do that:
To give a “name” to a range of data:
Click on the top number in the range of data and drag the mouse down to the bottom
number of the range.
For example, to give the name: “VISITS” to the cells: B9:B20, click on B9, and
drag the pointer down to B20 so that the cells B9:B20 are highlighted on your
computer screen. Then, click on:
Formulas
Deﬁne name (top center of your screen)
VISITS (enter this in the Name box; see Fig. 6.10)
OK
Now, repeat these steps to give the name: LAB to C9:C20

Finally, click on any blank cell on your spreadsheet to “deselect” cells C9:C20
on your computer screen.
Now, complete the data for these sample sizes, means, and standard deviations in
columns B and C so that B23 is 72.50, and C24 is 22.73 (use two decimals for the
means and standard deviations; see Fig. 6.11)
Objective: Find the correlation between VISITS and LAB

Hit the Enter key to compute the correlation
C26:
format this cell to two decimals
Note that the equal sign in ¼correl(VISITS,LAB) in C26 tells Excel that you are
going to use a formula in this cell.
The correlation between VISITS (X) and LAB (Y) is +.82, a very strong positive
correlation. This means that you have evidence that there is a strong relationship
between these two variables. In effect, the higher the number of visits to the clinic in
a week, the more laboratory tests run that same week by the clinic.

6.3
Creating a Chart and Drawing the Regression Line
onto the Chart
This section deals with the concept of “linear regression.” Technically, the use of a
simple linear regression model (i.e., the word “simple” means that only one
predictor, X, is used to predict the criterion, Y) requires that the data meet the
following four assumptions:
1. The underlying relationship between the two variables under study (X and Y) is
linear in the sense that a straight line, and not a curved line, can ﬁt the data points
on the chart.
2. The errors of measurement are independent of each other (e.g. the errors from a
speciﬁc time period are sometimes correlated with the errors in a previous time
period).
3. The errors ﬁt a normal distribution of Y-values at each of the X-values.
4. The variance of the errors is the same for all X-values (i.e., the variability of the
Y-values is the same for both low and high values of X).
Fig. 6.13 Final Result of Using the ¼correl Function to Compute the Correlation Coefﬁcient
6.3
Creating a Chart and Drawing the Regression Line onto the Chart
121

A detailed explanation of these assumptions is beyond the scope of this book, but
the interested reader can ﬁnd a detailed discussion of these assumptions in Levine
et al. (2011, pp. 529–530).
Now, let’s create a chart summarizing these data.
Important note: Whenever you draw a chart, it is ESSENTIAL that you put the
predictor variable (X) on the left, and the criterion variable
(Y) on the right in your Excel spreadsheet, so that you know
which variable is the predictor variable and which variable is the
criterion variable. If you do this, you will save yourself a lot of
grief whenever you do a problem involving correlation and
simple linear regression using Excel!
Important note: You need to understand that in any chart that has one predictor
and a criterion that there are really TWO LINES that can be
drawn between the data points:(1)
One line uses X as the
predictor, and Y as the criterion(2)
A second line uses Y as
the predictor, and X as the criterion. This means that you have
to be very careful to note in your input data the cells that contain
X as the predictor, and Y as the criterion. If you get these cells
mixed up and reverse them, you will create the wrong line for
your data and you will have botched the problem terribly.This is
why we STRONGLY RECOMMEND IN THIS BOOK that you
always put the X data (i.e., the predictor variable) on the LEFT of
your table, and the Y data (i.e., the criterion variable) on the
RIGHT of your table on your spreadsheet so that you don’t get
these variables mixed up.
Also note that the correlation, r, will be exactly the same correlation no matter
which variable you call the predictor variable and which variable you call the
criterion variable. The correlation coefﬁcient just summarizes the relationship
between two variables, and doesn’t care which one is the predictor and which
one is the criterion.
Let’s suppose that you would like to use the number of visits to the clinic in a
week as the predictor variable, and you would like to use it to predict the number of
laboratory tests run that same week by the clinic. Since the correlation between
these two variables is +.82, shows there is a strong, positive relationship and that
the number of visits to the clinic in a week is a good predictor of the number of lab
tests run that week by the clinic.

Finding the Regression Equation
The main reason for charting the relationship between X and Y (i.e., VISITS as X
and LAB as Y in our example) is to see if there is a strong enough relationship
between X and Y so that the regression equation that summarizes this relationship
can be used to predict Y for a given value of X.
Fig. 6.27 Final Spreadsheet of a Table and a Chart (90% Scale to Fit Size)

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Since we know that the correlation between the VISITS and LAB is +.82, this
tells us that it makes sense to use VISITS to predict LAB based on past data.
We now need to ﬁnd the regression equation that is the “best-ﬁtting straight line”
through the data points.
Objective: To ﬁnd the regression equation summarizing the relationship
between X and Y.
In order to ﬁnd this equation, we need to check to see if your version of Excel
contains the “Data Analysis ToolPak” necessary to run a regression analysis.

Using Excel to Find the SUMMARY OUTPUT
of Regression
You have now installed ToolPak, and you are ready to ﬁnd the regression equation for
the “best-ﬁtting straight line” through the data points by using the following steps:
Open the Excel ﬁle: LAB7 (if it is not already open on your screen)
Note: If this ﬁle is already open, and there is a “border” around the chart, you need
to click on any empty cell outside of the chart to deselect the chart.
Now that you have installed Toolpak, you are ready to ﬁnd the regression
equation summarizing the relationship between VISITS and LAB used in your
data set.
Remember that you gave the name: VISITS to the X data (the predictor), and the
name: LAB to the Y data (the criterion) in a previous section of this chapter (see
Sect. 6.2)

Scroll down the dialog box using the down arrow and highlight: Regression (see
Fig. 6.29)
OK
Input Y Range: LAB
Input X Range: VISITS
Click on the “button” to the left of Output Range to select this, and enterA52 in the
box as the place on your spreadsheet to insert the regression analysis in cell A52.
OK
The SUMMARY OUTPUT should now be in cells: A52 : I69
Now, make the columns in the Regression SUMMARY OUTPUT section of
your spreadsheet wider so that you can read all of the column headings clearly.
Now, change the data in the following two cells to Number format (two decimal
places):
B55
B68
Next, change this cell to four decimal places: B69
Now, change the format for all other numbers that are in decimal format to
number format, three decimal places, and center all numbers within their cells.
Print the ﬁle so that it ﬁts onto one page. (Hint: Change the scale under “Page
Layout” to 65% to make it ﬁt.) Your ﬁle should be like the ﬁle in Fig. 6.30.

Note the following problem with the summary output.
Whoever wrote the computer program for this version of Excel made a mistake
and gave the name: “Multiple R” to cell A55.
This is not correct. Instead, cell A55 should say: “correlation r” since this is the
notation that we are using for the correlation between X and Y.

MARY OUTPUT for the Data

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

You can now use your printout of the regression analysis to ﬁnd the regression
equation that is the best-ﬁtting straight line through the data points.
But ﬁrst, let’s review some basic terms.
6.5.2.1
Finding the y-Intercept, a, of the Regression Line
The point on the y-axis at which the regression line would intersect the y-axis if it
were extended to reach the y-axis is called the “y-intercept” and we will use the
letter “a” to stand for the y-intercept of the regression line. The y-intercept on the
SUMMARY OUTPUT of Fig. 6.30 is 27.77 (note the negative number) and
appears in cell B68. This means that if you were to draw an imaginary line
continuing down the regression line toward the y-axis that this imaginary line
would cross the y-axis at 27.77. This is why it is called the “y-intercept.”
6.5.2.2
Finding the Slope, b, of the Regression Line
The “tilt” of the regression line is called the “slope” of the regression line. It
summarizes to what degree the regression line is either above or below a horizontal
line through the data points. If the correlation between X and Y were zero, the
regression line would be exactly horizontal to the X-axis and would have a zero
slope.
If the correlation between X and Y is positive, the regression line would “slope
upward to the right” above the X-axis. Since the regression line in Fig. 6.30 slopes
upward to the right, the slope of the regression line is +2.1417 as given in cell B69.
We will use the notation “b” to stand for the slope of the regression line. (Note that
Excel calls the slope of the line: “X Variable 1” in the Excel printout.)
Since the correlation between VISITS and LAB was +.82, you can see that the
regression line for these data “slopes upward to the right” through the data. Note
that the SUMMARY OUTPUT of the regression line in Fig. 6.30 gives a correla-
tion, r, of +.82 in cell B55.
If the correlation between X and Y were negative, the regression line would
“slope down to the right” above the X-axis. This would happen whenever the
correlation between X and Y is a negative correlation that is between zero and
minus one (0 and 1).
6.5.3
Finding the Equation for the Regression Line
To ﬁnd the regression equation for the straight line that can be used to predict the
number of lab tests run in a week, we only need two numbers in the SUMMARY
OUTPUT in Fig. 6.30: B68 and B69.
6.5
Finding the Regression Equation
139

The format for the regression line is :
Y ¼ a þ b X
ð6:3Þ
where a ¼ the y-intercept (27.77 in our example in cell B68)
and b ¼ the slope of the line (+2.1417 in our example in cell B69)
Therefore, the equation for the best-ﬁtting regression line for our example is:
Y ¼ a þ b X
Y ¼ 27:77 þ 2:1417 X
Remember that Y is the number of lab tests run in a week that we are trying to
predict, using the number of visits to the clinic that same week as the predictor, X.
Let’s try an example using this formula to predict the number of lab tests run for
a week.
6.5.4
Using the Regression Line to Predict the y-Value
for a Given x-Value
Objective: To ﬁnd the number of lab tests predicted for a week in which the
clinic had 70 visits by patients
Since the number of visits is 70 that week (i.e., X ¼ 70), substituting this number
into our regression equation gives:
Y ¼ 27:77 þ 2:1417 70
ð
Þ
Y ¼ 27:77 þ 149:92
Y ¼ 122:15 or 122 lab tests predicted for a week with 70 visits
Important note: If you move directly upwards in your chart for CLINIC VISITS of
70 until you hit the regression line, you will see that you hit this
line just ABOVE 120 on the y-axis to the left when you draw a line
horizontal to the x-axis (actually, it is exactly 122.15), the result
from above for predicting the number of lab tests run for a week
with 70 visits to the clinic.
Now, let’s do a second example and predict the number of lab tests that would
result if we had 80 visits to the clinic in a week.
Y ¼ 27:77 þ 2:1417 X
Y ¼ 27:77 þ 2:1417 80
ð
Þ
Y ¼ 27:77 þ 171:34
Y ¼ 143:57 or 143 lab tests are predicted for a week with 80 visits
140
6
Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Important note: If you move directly upwards in your chart from clinic visits of
80 until you hit the regression line, you will see that you hit this
line just above 140 on the y-axis to the left (actually it is exactly
143.57), the result from above for predicting the number of lab test
run in a week with 80 visits to the clinic.
For a more detailed discussion of regression, see Rosenthal (2012) and Lewis
et al. (2011).
6.6
Adding the Regression Equation to the Chart
Objective: To Add the Regression Equation to the Chart
If you want to include the regression equation within the chart next to the regression
line, you can do that, but a word of caution ﬁrst.
Throughout this book, we are using the regression equation for one predictor and
one criterion to be the following:
Y ¼ a þ b X
ð6:3Þ
where a ¼ y-intercept and
b ¼ slope of the line
See, for example, the regression equation in Sect. 6.5.3 where the y-intercept
was a ¼ 27.77 and the slope of the line was b ¼ +2.1417 to generate the following
regression equation:
Y ¼ 27:77 þ 2:1417 X
However, Excel 2016 uses a slightly different regression equation (which is
logically identical to the one used in this book) when you add a regression equation
to a chart:
Y ¼ b X þ a
ð6:4Þ
where a ¼ y-intercept and b ¼ slope of the line
Note that this equation is identical to the one we are using in this book with the
terms arranged in a different sequence.
For the example we used in Sect. 6.5.3, Excel 2016 would write the regression
equation on the chart as:
Y ¼ 2:1417 X  27:77
6.6
Adding the Regression Equation to the Chart
141

This is the format that will result when you add the regression equation to the
chart using Excel 2016 using the following steps:
Open the ﬁle: LAB8 (that you saved in Sect. 6.5.2)
Click just inside the outer border of the chart in the top right corner to add the
“border” around the chart in order to “select the chart” for changes you are about
to make
Right-click on any of the data-points in the chart
Highlight: Add Trendline, and click on it to select this command
The “Linear button” near the top of the dialog box will be selected (on its left)
Scroll down this dialog box and click on: Display Equation on chart (near the
bottom of the dialog box; see Fig. 6.31)
Click on the X at the top right of the Format Trendline dialog box to remove this
box
Click on any empty cell to deselect the chart
Note that the regression equation on the chart is in the following form next to the
regression line on the chart (see Fig. 6.32).

How to Recognize Negative Correlations
in the SUMMARY OUTPUT Table
Important note: Since Excel does not recognize negative correlations in the SUM-
MARY OUTPUT results, but treats all correlations as if they were
positive correlations (this was a mistake made by the program-
mer), you need to be careful to note that there may be a negative
correlation between X and Y even if the printout says that the
correlation is a positive correlation.
You will know that the correlation between X and Y is a negative
correlation when these two things occur:
(1) THE SLOPE, b, IS A NEGATIVE NUMBER. This can only
occur when there is a negative correlation.
(2) THE CHART CLEARLY SHOWS A DOWNWARD SLOPE IN
THE REGRESSION LINE, which can only occur when the
correlation between X and Y is negative.
6.8
Printing Only Part of a Spreadsheet Instead
of the Entire Spreadsheet
Objective: To print part of a spreadsheet separately instead of printing the entire
spreadsheet
There will be many occasions when your spreadsheet is so large in the number of
cells used for your data and charts that you only want to print part of the spreadsheet
separately so that the print will not be so small that you cannot read it easily.
We will now explain how to print only part of a spreadsheet onto a separate page
by using three examples of how to do that using the ﬁle, LAB9, that you created in
Sect. 6.6: (1) printing only the table and the chart on a separate page, (2) printing
only the chart on a separate page, and (3) printing only the SUMMARY OUTPUT
of the regression analysis on a separate page.
Note: If the ﬁle: LAB9 is not open on your screen, you need to open it now.
If the “border” is around the outside of the chart, click on any white space
outside of the chart to deselect the chart.
Let’s describe how to do these three goals with three separate objectives:

Printing Only the Table and the Chart
on a Separate Page
Objective: To print only the table and the chart on a separate page
1. Left-click your mouse starting at the top left of the table in cell A3 and drag the
mouse down and to the right so that all of the table and all of the chart are
highlighted in light blue on your computer screen from cell A3 to cell H48 (the
light blue cells are called the “selection” cells).
2. File

The resulting printout should contain only the table of the data and the chart
resulting from the data.
Then, click on any empty cell in your spreadsheet to deselect the table and chart.
6.8.2
Printing Only the Chart on a Separate Page
Objective: To print only the chart on a separate page
1. Click on any “white space” just inside the outside border of the chart in the top
right corner of the chart to create the “border” around all of the borders of the
chart in order to “select” the chart.
2. File
Print
Print selected chart
Print selected chart (again)
Print
The resulting printout should contain only the chart resulting from the data.
Important note: Each time you print a chart by itself on a separate page, you should
immediately click on any white space OUTSIDE the chart to
remove the border from the chart. When the border is on the
borders of the chart, this tells Excel that you want to print only
the chart by itself. Do this now!

relationship between these two variables? Suppose that you decided to use the
CES-D Scale for a depression measure. This scale was developed by the Center
for Epidemiologic studies at the National Institute of Mental Health and has been
used in needs assessment studies as a self-report instrument (Royse 2010). The
scale is in the public domain and can be used without permission. Each resident
is asked to rate how they felt in the last week. The scale consists of 20 items
(e.g. “My sleep was restless”; “I felt lonely”) which are scored on the following
4-point scale:
•
Rarely or None of the Time (Less Than 1 day) is scored as: 0
•
Some or a Little of the Time (1–2 days) is scored as: 1
•
Occasionally or Moderate Amount of the Time (3–4 days) is scored as: 2
•
Most or All of the Time (5–7 days) is scored as: 3
Total scores can range from zero to 60 such that the higher the score, the
higher the depression level. Suppose that your nursing facility keeps records of
extended family visits, and that you have created the hypothetical data given in
Fig. 6.33.

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

(a) create an Excel spreadsheet and chart using DEPRESSION SCORE as the
criterion (dependent variable) and NO. OF EXTENDED FAMILY VISITS
LAST MONTH as the predictor using the following format:
• Top
title:
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
FAMILY
VISITS
AND
DEPRESSION SCORE
• x-axis title: NO. OF EXTENDED FAMILY VISITS LAST MONTH
• y-axis title: DEPRESSION SCORE
• Re-size the chart so that it is 7 columns wide and 25 rows long
• Delete the legend
• Delete the gridlines
• Move the chart below the table
Important note: Below the table, add the word: correlation, and in the cell to its
right, use the ¼correl function to ﬁnd the correlation between
these two variables. Use two decimal points for this correlation.
(b) Create the least-squares regression line for these data on the scatterplot. Add
the regression equation to the regression line on the chart.
(c) Use Excel’s regression function to ﬁnd the equation for the least-squares
regression line for these data and display the results below the chart on your
spreadsheet.
(d) Use number format (two decimal places) for the correlation and also the
coefﬁcients on the SUMMARY OUTPUT, and use number format (three
decimal places) for all of the other decimal ﬁgures in the SUMMARY
OUTPUT.
(e) Print the input data and the chart so that this information ﬁts onto one page.
(f) Then, print the regression output table so that this information ﬁts onto a
separate page.

Answer the following questions using your Excel printout:
1. What is the correlation r?
2. What is the y-intercept a?
3. What is the slope b?
4. What is the regression equation (use two decimal places for the
y-intercept and the slope)?
5. Use the regression equation to predict the DEPRESSION SCORE you
would expect for 5 (ﬁve) extended family visits last month.
Important note: Since Excel does not recognize negative correlations in the SUM-
MARY OUTPUT but treats all correlations as if they were positive
correlations, you need to be careful to note when there is a
negative correlation between the two variables under study.You
know that the correlation is negative when:(1)
The slope, b, is a
negative number, which can only occur when there is a negative
correlation.(2)
The chart clearly shows a downward slope in the
regression line, which can only happen when the correlation is
negative.
2. The Director of a child protection agency is concerned with the impact of budget
cuts last year which increased the caseload of child protection social workers.
For the ﬁrst six months of last year, the average caseload was about 35 clients per
social worker. Starting in July 1 of last year, a forced budget cut increased the
average caseload to about 50 clients per social worker. The Director is wonder-
ing about the relationship between caseload size and the number of sick days
taken by social workers in the agency, and has asked you to collect data from
employee records to determine: (1) The number of sick days in the past six
months of last year for each of the 18 social workers who worked all 12 months
of last year and (2) The average caseload of these social workers for the last six
months of last year. You have decided to test your Excel skills, and you have
created the hypothetical data given in Fig. 6.34

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Create an Excel spreadsheet and enter the data using CASELOAD SIZE as
the independent variable (predictor) and NO. OF SICK DAYS as the dependent
variable (criterion).
(a) create an XY scatterplot of these two sets of data such that:
• top title: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CASELOAD SIZE AND NO. OF
SICK DAYS
• x-axis title: CASELOAD SIZE
• y-axis title: NO. OF SICK DAYS
• re-size the chart so that it is 7 columns wide and 25 rows long
• delete the legend
• delete the gridlines
• move the chart below the table
(b) Create the least-squares regression line for these data on the scatterplot.
(c) Use Excel to run the regression statistics to ﬁnd the equation for the least-
squares regression line for these data and display the results below the chart
on your spreadsheet. Use number format (two decimal places) for the
correlation, r, and also for both the y-intercept and the slope of the line.
Change all other decimal ﬁgures to four decimal places.
(d) Print the input data and the chart so that this information ﬁts onto one page.

(e) Then, print out the regression output table so that this information ﬁts onto a
separate page.
By hand:
(1a) Circle and label the value of the y-intercept and the slope of the
regression line on the regression output table that you just printed.
(2b) Estimate from the graph the NO. OF SICK DAYS you would predict for
a CASELOAD SIZE of 50 for the last six months of last year, and write
your answer in the space immediately below:

Answer the following questions using your Excel printout:
1. What is the correlation?
2. What is the y-intercept?
3. What is the slope of the line?
4. What is the regression equation for these data (use two decimal places for
the y-intercept and the slope)?
5. Use that regression equation to predict the NO. OF SICK DAYS you
would expect for a CASELOAD of 50.
(Note that this correlation is not the multiple correlation as the Excel table
indicates, but is merely the correlation r instead.)
You should have found a positive correlation of +.42 between CASE-
LOAD SIZE and NO. OF SICK DAYS. You know that the correlation is a
positive correlation for two reasons: (1) the regression line slopes upward
and to the right on the chart, signaling a positive correlation, and (2) the
slope is +0.19 which also tells you that the correlation is a positive
correlation.
3. Suppose that you wanted to study the relationship between DIET (measured in
calories allowed per day) and WEIGHT LOSS (measured in kilograms, kg) for
adult women between the ages of 30 and 40 who are overweight for their height
and body structure, and who all weigh roughly the same number of kilograms
before undertaking the weight loss program. You want to test your Excel skills
on a random sample of these women based on their weight change over the past
four months to make sure that you can do this type of research. The hypothetical
data appear in Fig. 6.35:

tion to ﬁnd the correlation between these two variables. Label the correlation and
place it underneath the table; then round off the correlation to two decimal
places.
(a) create an XY scatterplot of these two sets of data such that:
• top title: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIET AND WEIGHT LOSS
• x-axis title: DIET (calories allowed per day)

• move the chart below the table and the correlation
• re-size the chart so that it is 8 columns wide and 25 rows long

on your spreadsheet. Use number format (two decimal places) for the
correlation and three decimal places for all other decimal ﬁgures, including
the coefﬁcients.
(d) Print just the input data and the chart so that this information ﬁts onto one

Chapter 7
Multiple Correlation and Multiple Regression
There are many times in social work research when you may be able to develop a
better prediction model for a dependent (criterion) variable, Y, by using several
predictors in combination (e.g. X1, X2, X3, etc.) instead of a single predictor, X.
The resulting statistical procedure is called “multiple regression” because it uses
two or more predictors in combination to predict Y, instead of a single predictor,
X. Each predictor is “weighted” differently based on its separate correlation with Y
and its correlation with the other predictors. The job of multiple correlation is to
produce a regression equation that will weight each predictor differently and in such
a way that the combination of predictors does a better job of predicting Y than any
single predictor by itself. We will call the multiple correlation: Rxy.
You will recall (see Sect. 6.5.3) that the regression equation that predicts Y when
only one predictor, X, is used is:
Y ¼ a þ bX
ð7:1Þ
You will remember from Chap. 6 that the correlation, r, ranges from 1 to +1.
However, the multiple correlation, Rxy, only ranges from zero to plus one (0 to +1).
The multiple correlation is never a negative number!
7.1
Multiple Regression Equation
The multiple regression equation follows a similar format and is:
Y ¼ aþb1X1 þb2X2 þb3X3 þ etc:depending on thenumber of predictors used
ð7:2Þ
The “weight” given to each predictor in the equation is represented by the letter
“b” with a subscript to correspond to the same subscript on the predictors.

Important note: In order to do multiple regression, you need to have installed the
“Data Analysis ToolPak” that was described in Chap. 6 (see Sect.
6.5.1). If you did not install this, you need to do so now!
Let’s try a practice problem.
The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a standardized test that is an
admissions requirement for many U.S. graduate schools that offer a Master’s degree
in Social Work (MSW) or a Master’s degree in Health Administration (MHA). The
GRE is intended to measure general academic preparedness, regardless of special-
ization ﬁeld. The GRE test produces three subtest scores: (1) GRE VERBAL
REASONING (scale 130-170), (2) GRE QUANTITATIVE REASONING (scale
130-170), and (3) ANALYTICAL WRITING (scale 0–6).
Suppose that the Director of the MHA program at a major university has heard
about your new Excel skills that you are developing using this book in your Social
Work Statistics course, and that this Director has asked you to “think outside the
box” and to help her study the relationship between GRE VERBAL, GRE QUAN-
TITATIVE, and GRE WRITING scores to predict the ﬁrst-year GPA (FIRST-
YEAR GPA) of students in the Master’s of Health Administration program
(MHA) at her university using last year’s entering class of students in that program.
You have decided to use the three subtest scores as the predictors, X1, X2, and X3
and the ﬁrst-year grade-point average (FIRST-YEAR GPA) as the criterion, Y. To
test your Excel skills, you have randomly selected a small group of students from
last year’s entering MHA class, and have recorded their scores on these variables.
Let’s use the following notation:
Y
FIRST-YEAR GPA
X1
GRE VERBAL
X2
GRE QUANTITATIVE
X3
GRE WRITING
Suppose, further, that you have collected the following hypothetical data sum-
marizing these scores (see Fig. 7.1):
154

Multiple Correlation and Multiple Regression

Create an Excel spreadsheet for these data using the following cell reference:
A2:
GRADUATE RECORD EXAMINATION (GRE)
A4:
How well does the GRE predict ﬁrst-year GPA in an MHA program?
A6:
FIRST-YEAR GPA
A7:
3.25
B6:
GRE VERBAL
C6:
GRE QUANTITATIVE
D6:
GRE WRITING
D18: 5
Next, change the column width to match the above table, and change all GPA
ﬁgures to number format (two decimal places).
Now, ﬁll in the additional data in the spreadsheet such that:
A18:
3.45
B18:
160
D18:
5
Then, center all numbers in your table
Important note: Be sure to double-check all of your numbers in your table to be sure
that they are correct, or your spreadsheets will be incorrect.
Save this ﬁle as:
GRE3
Before we do the multiple regression analysis, we need to try to make one
important point very clear:
Fig. 7.1 Worksheet Data for GRE versus FIRST-YEAR GPA (Practical Example)
7.1
Multiple Regression Equation
155

Important: When we used one predictor, X, to predict one criterion, Y, we said that
you need to make sure that the X variable is ON THE LEFT in your
table, and the Y variable is ON THE RIGHT in your table so that you
don’t get these variables mixed up (see Sect. 6.3).
However, in multiple regression, you need to follow this rule which is
exactly the opposite:
When you use several predictors in multiple regression, it is essential
that the criterion you are trying to predict, Y, be ON THE FAR LEFT,
and that all of the predictors be TO THE RIGHT of the criterion, Y, in
your table so that you know which variable is the criterion, Y, and which
variables are the predictors. If you make this a habit, you will save
yourself a lot of grief.
Notice in the table above, that the criterion Y (FIRST-YEAR GPA) is on the far
left of the table, and the three predictors (GRE VERBAL, GRE QUANTITATIVE,
and GRE WRITING) are to the right of the criterion variable. If you follow this
rule, you will be less likely to make a mistake when conducting multiple regression.

159

Once you have the SUMMARY OUTPUT, you can determine the multiple
correlation and the regression equation that is the best-ﬁt line through the data
points using GRE VERBAL, GRE QUANTITATIVE, and GRE WRITING as the
three predictors, and FIRST-YEAR GPA as the criterion.
Note on the SUMMARY OUTPUT where it says: “Multiple R.” This term is
correct since this is the term Excel uses for the multiple correlation, which is +0.91.
This means, that from these data, the combination of GRE VERBAL, GRE QUAN-
TITATIVE, and GRE WRITING scores together form a very strong positive
relationship in predicting FIRST-YEAR GPA.
To ﬁnd the regression equation, notice the coefﬁcients at the bottom of the
SUMMARY OUTPUT in cells B36 – B 39:

7.621
GRE VERBAL SCORE: b1

Since the general form of the multiple regression equation is:
Y ¼ a þ b1X1 þ b2X2 þ b3X3
ð7:2Þ
we can now write the multiple regression equation for these data:
Y ¼ 7:621  0:023 X1 þ 0:089 X2 þ 0:078X3

Using Excel to Create a Correlation Matrix in Multiple
Regression
The ﬁnal step in multiple regression is to ﬁnd the correlation between all of the
variables that appear in the regression equation.
In our example, this means that we need to ﬁnd the correlation between each of
the six pairs of variables:
To do this, we need to use Excel to create a “correlation matrix.” This matrix
summarizes the correlations between all of the variables in the problem.

OK
The resulting correlation matrix appears in A42:E46 (See Fig. 7.8).
Next, format all of the numbers in the correlation matrix that are in decimals to two
decimals places. And, also, make column D wider so that the GRE
QUANTITIVE score label ﬁts inside cell D42.
Re-save this Excel ﬁle as:

7.4
Using Excel to Create a Correlation Matrix in Multiple Regression
163

Note that the number “1” along the diagonal of the correlation matrix means that
the correlation of each variable with itself is a perfect, positive correlation of 1.0.
Correlation coefﬁcients are always expressed in just two decimal places.
You are now ready to read the correlation between the six pairs of variables:
The correlation between GRE VERBAL and FIRST-YEAR GPA is:
+.79
The correlation between GRE QUANTITATIVE and FIRST-YEAR GPA is: +.88
The correlation between GRE WRITING and FIRST-YEAR GPA is:
+.83
The correlation between GRE VERBAL and GRE QUANTITATIVE is:
+.94
The correlation between GRE VERBAL and GRE WRITING is:
+.72
The correlation between GRE QUANTITATIVE and GRE WRITING is:
+.83
This means that the best single predictor of FIRST-YEAR GPA is the GRE
QUANTITATIVE SCORE with a correlation of +.88. Adding the other two
predictor variables, GRE VERBAL and GRE WRITING, improved the prediction

Multiple Correlation and Multiple Regression

by only 0.03 to 0.91, resulting in only a slightly better prediction. GRE QUANTI-
TATIVE scores are an excellent predictor of FIRST-YEAR GPA all by themselves.

and Veney (2003).

3. Suppose that you wanted to study the relationship between the number of visits
to a health care clinic during the past year by the insured population (i.e., the
volume of care provided to the patient) and the ability of the patient to pay for
care services (measured by dividing the disposable family income of the patient
by the patient’s family size) and the distance (to the nearest mile) from the
patient’s residence to the clinic. For example, is distance negatively correlated
with the number of visits?
You have decided to use a multiple correlation and multiple regression

One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
So far in this 2016 Excel Guide, you have learned how to use a one-group t-test to
compare the sample mean to the population mean, and a two-group t-test to test for
the difference between two sample means. But what should you do when you have
more than two groups and you want to determine if there is a signiﬁcant difference
between the means of these groups?
The answer to this question is:
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
The ANOVA test allows you to test for the difference between the means when
you have three or more groups in your research study. The null hypothesis is that all
of the population means are equal. The research hypothesis is that at least two of the
population means are signiﬁcantly different from one another. To conduct an
ANOVA test, you need to assume both that the populations are normally distributed
and also that they have equal standard deviations.
Important note: In order to do One-way Analysis of Variance, you need to have
installed the “Data Analysis Toolpak” that was described in
Chap. 6 (see Sect. 6.5.1). If you did not install this, you need to
do that now!
Let’s suppose you are working as a social work researcher in a health care
system and want to compare the diagnostic time required for an initial new patient
visit at each of the three clinics your company operates (Clinic A, Clinic B, and
Clinic C). Assume that you have recorded the number of minutes (to the nearest
minute) to complete a new patient diagnostic visit at each of the three clinics by
taking a random sample of initial visitors during the past six months. The hypo-
thetical results are given in Fig. 8.1.

You have been asked to analyze the data to determine if there was any signiﬁcant
difference in diagnostic time between the three clinics. Note that it is not necessary
for each clinic to see the same number of patients or to have the same sample size in
order for ANOVA to be used on the data. Statisticians delight in this fact by stating
that: “ANOVA is a very robust test.” (Statisticians love that term!)
Create an Excel spreadsheet for these data in this way:
A4:
DIAGNOSTIC TIME OF INITIAL VISIT
A6:
(data are in minutes)
B8:
Clinic A
C8:
Clinic B
D8:
Clinic C
B9:

Enter the other information into your spreadsheet table. When you have ﬁnished
entering these data, the last cell on the left should have 31 in cell B18, and the last
cell on the right should have 15 in cell D17. Center the numbers in each of the
columns. Use number format (zero decimals) for all numbers.
Important note: Be sure to double-check all of your ﬁgures in the table to make sure
that they are exactly correct or you will not be able to obtain the
correct answer for this problem!

How to Interpret the ANOVA Table Correctly

ANOVA allows you to test for the differences between means when you have three
or more groups of data. This ANOVA test is called the F-test statistic, and is
typically identiﬁed with the letter: F.
The formula for the F-test is this:
F ¼ Mean Square between groups (MSb) divided by Mean Square
within groups (MSw)
F ¼ MSb=MSw
ð8:1Þ
The derivation and explanation of this formula is beyond the scope of this Excel
Guide. In this Excel Guide, we are attempting to teach you how to use Excel to
conduct statistical tests, and we are not attempting to teach you the statistical theory
that is behind the ANOVA formulas. For a detailed explanation of ANOVA, see
Randolph and Myers (2013) and Veney et al. (2003).
Note that cell D33 contains MSb ¼ 323.79, while cell D34 contains
MSw ¼ 13.52.
When you divide these two ﬁgures using their cell references in Excel, you get
an answer for the F-test of 23.95, which is in cell E33. (Remember, Excel is more
accurate than your calculator!) Let’s discuss the meaning of the ﬁgure: F ¼ 23.95.
In order to determine whether this ﬁgure for F of 23.95 indicates a signiﬁcant
difference between the means of the three groups, the ﬁrst step is to write out the
null hypothesis and the research hypothesis for the time required to conduct initial
visits for each of the three clinics.
In our initial visit comparisons, the null hypothesis states that the population
means of the three groups are equal, while the research hypothesis states that the
population means of the three groups are not equal, and that there is, therefore, a
signiﬁcant difference between the population means of the three groups. Which of
these two hypotheses should you accept based on the ANOVA results?
8.3
Using the Decision Rule for the ANOVA F-Test
To state the hypotheses, let’s refer to Clinic A as Group 1, Clinic B as Group 2, and
Clinic C as Group 3. The hypotheses would then be:
H0: μ1 ¼ μ2 ¼ μ3
H1: μ1 6¼ μ2 6¼ μ3
The answer to this question is analogous to the decision rule used in this book for
both the one-group t-test and the two-group t-test. You will recall that this rule (See
Sects. 4.1.6 and 5.1.8) was:
If the absolute value of t is less than the critical t, you accept the null hypothesis.
or
176
8
One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

If the absolute value of t is greater than the critical t, you reject the null
hypothesis, and accept the research hypothesis.
Now, here is the decision rule for ANOVA:
Objective: To learn the decision rule for the ANOVA F-test
The decision rule for the ANOVA F-test is the following:
If the value for F is less than the critical F-value, accept the null hypothesis.
or
If the value of F is greater than the critical F-value, reject the null hypothesis,
and accept the research hypothesis.
Note that Excel tells you the critical F-value in cell G33: 3.40
Therefore, our decision rule for the initial visits AVOVA test is this:
Since the value of F of 23.95 is greater than the critical F-value of 3.40, we reject
the null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
Therefore, our conclusion, in plain English, is:
There was a signiﬁcant difference between the number of minutes required for the
initial diagnostic visit between the three clinics.
Note that it is not necessary to take the absolute value of F of 23.95. The F-value
can never be less than one, and so it can never be a negative value which requires us
to take its absolute value in order to treat it as a positive value.
It is important to note that ANOVA tells us that there was a signiﬁcant difference
between the population means of the three groups, but it does not tell us which pairs
of groups were signiﬁcantly different from each other.
8.4
Testing for the Difference Between Two Groups Using
the ANOVA t-Test
To answer that question, we need to do a different test called the ANOVA t-test.
Objective: To test the difference between the means of two groups using an
ANOVA t-test when the ANOVA F-test results indicate a signiﬁcant
difference between the population means.
Since we have three groups of data (one group for each of the three clinics), we
would have to perform three separate ANOVA t-tests to determine which pairs of
8.4
Testing for the Difference Between Two Groups Using the ANOVA t-Test
177

groups were signiﬁcantly different. This requires that we would have to perform a
separate ANOVA t-test for the following pairs of groups:
1. Clinic A vs. Clinic B
2. Clinic A vs. Clinic C
3. Clinic B vs. Clinic C
We will do just one of these pairs of tests, Clinic A vs. Clinic C, to illustrate the
way to perform an ANOVA t-test comparing these two clinics. The ANOVA t-test
for the other two pairs of groups would be done in the same way.
8.4.1
Comparing Clinic A vs. Clinic C in Time Required
to Conduct an Initial Visit Using the ANOVA t-Test
Objective: To compare Clinic A vs. Clinic C in minutes required for the initial
diagnostic visit using the ANOVA t-test.
The ﬁrst step is to write out the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis for these
two clinics.
For the ANOVA t-test, the null hypothesis is that the population means of the
two groups are equal, while the research hypothesis is that the population means of
the two groups are not equal (i.e., there is a signiﬁcant difference between these two
means). Since we are comparing Clinic A (Group 1) vs. Clinic C (Group 3), these
hypotheses would be:
H0: μ1 ¼ μ3
H1: μ1 6¼ μ3
For Group 1 vs. Group 3, the formula for the ANOVA t-test is:
ANOVA t ¼
X1  X2
s:e:ANOVA

s:e:ANOVA ¼

formula.

One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

The steps involved in computing this ANOVA t-test are:
1. Find
the
difference
of
the
sample
means
for
the
two
groups:
(29.20  19.11 ¼ 10.09).
2. Find 1/n1 + 1/n3 (since both groups have a different number of visitors in them,
this becomes: 1/10 + 1/9 ¼ 0.10 + 0.11 ¼ 0.21
3. Multiply MSw times the answer for step 2: (13.52  0.21 ¼ 2.84)
4. Take the square root of step 3: SQRT (2.84) ¼ 1.68
5. Divide Step 1 by Step 4 to ﬁnd the ANOVA t: (10.09/1.68 ¼ 6.00)
Note: Since Excel computes all calculations to 16 decimal places, when you use
Excel for the above computations, your answer will be 5.97 in two decimal
places. Excel’s answer will be much more accurate because it always uses
16 decimal places in its computations.
Now, what do we do with this ANOVA t-test result of 6.00? In order to interpret
this value of 6.00 correctly, we need to determine the critical value of t for the
ANOVA t-test. To do that, we need to ﬁnd the degrees of freedom for the ANOVA
t-test as follows:
8.4.1.1
Finding the Degrees of Freedom for the ANOVA t-Test
Objective: To ﬁnd the degrees of freedom for the ANOVA t-test.
The degrees of freedom (df) for the ANOVA t-test is found as follows:
df ¼ take the total sample size of all of the groups and subtract the number of
groups in your study (nTOTAL  k where k ¼ the number of groups)
In our example, the total sample size of the three groups is 27 since there are
10 visitors in Group 1, 8 visitors in Group 2, and 9 visitors in Group 3, and since
there are three groups, 27–3 gives a degrees of freedom for the ANOVA t-test of 24.
If you look up df ¼ 24 in the t-table in Appendix E in the degrees of freedom
column (df), which is the second column on the left of this table, you will ﬁnd that
the critical t-value is 2.064.
Important note: Be sure to use the degrees of freedom column (df) in Appendix E
for the ANOVA t-test critical t value
8.4.1.2
Stating the Decision Rule for the ANOVA t-Test
Objective: To learn the decision rule for the ANOVA t-test
8.4
Testing for the Difference Between Two Groups Using the ANOVA t-Test
179

Interpreting the result of the ANOVA t-test follows the same decision rule that we
used for both the one-group t-test (see Sect. 4.1.6) and the two-group t-test (see
Sect. 5.1.8):
If the absolute value of t is less than the critical value of t, we accept the null
hypothesis.
or
If the absolute value of t is greater than the critical value of t, we reject the null
hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
Since we are using a type of t-test, we need to take the absolute value of t. Since
the absolute value of 6.00 is greater than the critical t-value of 2.064, we reject the
null hypothesis (that the population means of the two groups are equal) and accept
the research hypothesis (that the population means of the two groups are signiﬁ-
cantly different from one another).
This means that our conclusion, in plain English, is as follows:
The average initial diagnostic visit at Clinic A was signiﬁcantly longer than the
average initial diagnostic visit at Clinic C (29 minutes vs. 19 minutes).

One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

For a more detailed explanation of the ANOVA t-test, see Scott and Mazhindu
(2005) and Black (2010).
Important note: You are only allowed to perform an ANOVA t-test comparing the
means of two groups when the F-test produces a signiﬁcant differ-
ence between the means of all of the groups in your study.

8.4
Testing for the Difference Between Two Groups Using the ANOVA t-Test
181

It is improper to do any ANOVA t-test when the value of F is less
than the critical value of F. Whenever F is less than the critical F,
this means that there was no difference between the means of the
groups, and, therefore, any test conducted to see if there is a
difference between the means of these two groups would capitalize
on chance differences between the two groups.

2. In a multi-institutional arrangement, the delay in transferring inpatients to an
alternate source of care after hospitalization is an important factor. If you
measure “delay” by the number of days between the date when a patient was
ready for transfer and the date on which the patient was transferred to a nursing
home, you can compare the hospitals in your organization in terms of their days
of delay to effect this transfer. Suppose that you decide to take a random sample
of inpatients who were transferred from the hospital to a nursing home over the
past six months from each of the four hospitals in your system.
Note that each hospital can have a different sample size of inpatients in order
for ANOVA to be used on the data. Statisticians delight in this fact by stating

Important note: Look at your ﬁnal spreadsheet: FAMILY3. If you used the ¼correl
function to ﬁnd the correlation below the data table, it should be:
.45 (a negative correlation!). Note that the SUMMARY OUTPUT
gives a correlation of +.45 because the correlation in this output
table will NEVER be a negative correlation because of a huge
mistake that the computer programmer made in creating the for-
mula for the correlation (and which the programmer also labeled
incorrectly as: “Multiple R”, when it should have been labeled:
“correlation r” instead.

The Master of Social Work program (MSW) at the University of Missouri-St. Louis
in St. Louis, Missouri USA is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.
A course in statistics is one of the required courses in this program. Suppose that
you have asked to create a table that summarizes the ﬁnal exam performance of
students (100 points possible) in this course during the past semester. You want to
try out your Excel skills on a small sample of students, and you have created the
hypothetical data given in Fig. B.1.
(a) Create an Excel table for these data, and then use Excel to the right of the table
to ﬁnd the sample size, mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the
mean for these data. Label your answers, and round off the mean, standard
deviation, and standard error of the mean to two decimal places.

223

(a) Set up a spreadsheet of frame numbers for these patients with the heading:
FRAME NUMBERS
(b) Then, create a separate column to the right of these frame numbers which
duplicates these frame numbers with the title: Duplicate frame numbers.
(c) Then, create a separate column to the right of these duplicate frame numbers
called RAND NO. and use the ¼RAND() function to assign random numbers to
all of the frame numbers in the duplicate frame numbers column. Change this
column format so that three decimal places appear for each random number.
(d) Sort the duplicate frame numbers and random numbers into a random order.
(e) Print the result so that the spreadsheet ﬁts onto one page.
(f) Circle on your printout the I.D. number of the ﬁrst 20 patients that you would
use in your survey.
(g) Save the ﬁle as:

Important note: Everyone who does this problem will generate a different
random order of patient ID numbers since Excel assigns a
different random number each time the RAND() command is
used. For this reason, the answer to this problem given in this
Excel Guide will have a completely different sequence of
random numbers from the random sequence that you gener-
ate. This is normal and is to be expected.

The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a standardized test that is an admis-
sions requirement for many U.S. graduate schools that offer an MSW degree. The
GRE is intended to measure academic preparedness, regardless of specialization
ﬁeld. Let’s suppose that you have been hired as a research assistant by a Director of
a Master of Social Work (MSW) program at a major university and that the Director
has asked you to ﬁnd the relationship between GRE VERBAL (score range: 130–
170), GRE QUANTITATIVE (score range: 130–170), and GRE WRITING (score

Appendices

range: 0–6) in terms of their ability to predict the ﬁrst-year GPA for students in this
program. In addition, the Director has asked you to add a fourth predictor, UNDER-
GRADUATE GPA, to your analysis. You want to test your Excel skills, so you
have created the hypothetical data in Fig. B.6.
(a) create an Excel spreadsheet using FIRST-YEAR GPA as the dependent (crite-
rion) variable (Y), and the other variables as the four predictors of this criterion
(X1 ¼ VERBAL, X2 ¼ QUANTITATIVE, X3 ¼ WRITING, and X4 ¼ UNDER-
GRADUATE GPA).
(b) Use Excel’s multiple regression function to ﬁnd the relationship between these
ﬁve variables and place the SUMMARY OUTPUT below the table.
(c) Use number format (two decimal places) for the multiple correlation on the
Summary Output, and use three decimal places for the coefﬁcients in the
SUMMARY OUTPUT.
(d) Save the ﬁle as:
GRE33
(e) Print the table and regression results below the table so that they ﬁt onto

Answer the following questions using your Excel printout:
1. What is the multiple correlation Rxy?
2. What is the y-intercept a?
3. What is the coefﬁcient for VERBAL, b1?
4. What is the coefﬁcient for QUANTITATIVE, b2?
5. What is the coefﬁcient for WRITING, b3?

Chapter 8: Practice Test
A budget request from a long-term care facility needs to be based, in part, on the
complexity of care required by each resident A healthcare administrator wants to
determine the case complexity by comparing a random sample of patients from
three facilities (A, B, C) that are part of this multi-institutional organization on the
number of secondary diagnoses required by adult women patients (ages 50–60) who
have been admitted to the facilities during the twelve months preceding the past
60 days. You decide to test your Excel skills on a small sample of residents from
each of three facilities, and you have created the hypothetical data given in Fig. B.7.
232
Appendices

(a) Enter these data on an Excel spreadsheet.
Let FACILITY A ¼ Group 1, FACILITY B ¼ Group 2, and FACILITY
C ¼ Group 3.
(b) On your spreadsheet, write the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis for
these data.
(c) Perform a one-way ANOVA test on these data, and show the resulting ANOVA
table underneath the input data for the three facilities.
(d) If the F-value in the ANOVA table is signiﬁcant, create an Excel formula to
compute the ANOVA t-test comparing FACILITY B versus FACILITY C, and
show the results below the ANOVA table on the spreadsheet (put the standard
error and the ANOVA t-test value on separate lines of your spreadsheet, and
use two decimal places for each value)
(e) Print out the resulting spreadsheet so that all of the information ﬁts onto one
page
(f) On your printout, label by hand the MS (between groups) and the MS (within
groups)
(g) Circle and label the value for F on your printout for the ANOVA of the input
data

233

(h) Label by hand on the printout the mean for FACILITY B and the mean for
FACILITY C that were produced by your ANOVA.
(i) Save the spreadsheet as:
SECONDARY3
On a separate sheet of paper, now do the following by hand:
(j) Find the critical value of F in the ANOVA Single Factor results table.
(k) Write a summary of the result of the ANOVA test for the input data.
(l) Write a summary of the conclusion of the ANOVA test in plain English for the
input data.
(m) Write the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis comparing FACILITY B
versus FACILITY C.
(n) Compute the degrees of freedom for the ANOVA t-test by hand for three types
of facilities.
(o) Use your calculator and Excel to compute the standard error (s.e.) of the
ANOVA t-test.
(p) Use your calculator and Excel to compute the ANOVA t-test value.
(q) Write the critical value of t for the ANOVA t-test using the table in
Appendix E.
(r) Write a summary of the result of the ANOVA t-test.
(s) Write a summary of the conclusion of the ANOVA t-test in plain English.
