About the Authors
John R. Levine was a member of a computer club in high school — before 
high school students, or even high schools, had computers — where he met 
Theodor H. Nelson, the author of Computer Lib/Dream Machines and the 
inventor of hypertext, who reminded us that computers should not be taken 
seriously and that everyone can and should understand and use computers.
John wrote his first program in 1967 on an IBM 1130 (a computer somewhat 
less powerful than your typical modern digital wristwatch, only more difficult 
to use). He became an official system administrator of a networked computer 
at Yale in 1975. He began working part-time — for a computer company, of 
course — in 1977 and has been in and out of the computer and network biz 
ever since. He got his company on Usenet (the Internet’s worldwide bulletin-
board system) early enough that it appears in a 1982 Byte magazine article on 
a map of Usenet, which then was so small that the map fit on half a page.
Although John used to spend most of his time writing software, now he 
mostly writes books (including UNIX For Dummies and Internet Secrets, both 
published by Wiley, and Windows Vista: the Complete Reference, published 
by Osborne / McGraw-Hill) because it’s more fun and he can do so at home 
in the tiny village of Trumansburg, New York, where in his spare time he was 
the mayor for several years (yes, really, see www.Trumansburg.ny.us) 
and can play with his daughter when he’s supposed to be writing. John also 
does a fair amount of public speaking. (Go to www.johnlevine.com to see 
where he’ll be.) He holds a B.A. and a Ph.D. in computer science from Yale 
University, but please don’t hold that against him.
In high school, Margaret Levine Young was in the same computer club as her 
big brother, John. She stayed in the field throughout college against her better 
judgment and despite John’s presence as a graduate student in the computer 
science department. Margy graduated from Yale and went on to become one of 
the first PC managers in the early 1980s at Columbia Pictures, where she rode 
the elevator with big stars whose names she wouldn’t dream of dropping here.
Since then, Margy has co-authored more than 25 computer books about topics 
that include the Internet, UNIX, WordPerfect, Microsoft Access, and (stab 
from the past) PC-File and Javelin, including The Internet For Dummies Quick 
Reference and UNIX For Dummies (both published by Wiley), Windows Vista: 
The Complete Reference, and Internet: The Complete Reference (both pub­
lished by Osborne/McGraw-Hill). She met her future husband, Jordan, in the 
R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R.S. (that computer club we mentioned). Her other passion is her 
children, along with music, Unitarian Universalism, reading, knitting, gardening 
(you can never grow too much garlic), and anything to do with eating. She lives 
in Vermont (see www.gurus.org/margy for some scenery) and works as a 
software engineer for the Unitarian Universalist Association (www.uua.org).

Dedication
John dedicates his part of the book (the particularly lame jokes) to Sarah 
Willow, who surprises and delights him every day, and to Tonia, now and 
always.
Margy dedicates this book to her niece Alana Margaret Schumb. And, of 
course, to Jordan, Meg, and Zac.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
We thank Kenneth Sutton for information about Second Life, Zac Young and 
James Curran for information about online games, and Kasey Melski for help 
with World of Warcraft.
Mark Enochs hustled us through the editorial process despite our attempts 
to drag it out while (no doubt at great personal cost) making us look like 
better writers than we are. Rebecca Whitney is the editor for whom we get 
down on our knees and beg when we begin each update to this book. Steve 
Hayes gets us organized, which is no easy task. Thanks also to the rest 
of the gang at Wiley Publishing, especially those listed on the Publisher’s 
Acknowledgments page.
Margy thanks Jordan for holding everything together. We all thank Bill 
Gladstone at Waterside Productions for encouragement. The entire contents 
of this book were edited and submitted to the publisher using the Web — 
practicing what we preach. We thank our Internet providers: Finger Lakes 
Technologies Group (Trumansburg, N.Y. Hi, Paul!), Lightlink (Ithaca, N.Y. Hi, 
Homer!), and Shoreham.net (Shoreham, Vermont. Hi, Don and Jim!).
Finally, thanks to all the smarties (we wouldn’t say wiseacres) who sent us 
comments on the previous editions and helped make this one better. If you 
have ideas, comments, or complaints, about the book, whisk them to us at 
internet12@gurus.org.

Introduction
W
elcome to The Internet For Dummies, 12th Edition. The Internet has 
become so interwoven in today’s life — work, school, politics, and 
play — that ignoring it is no longer an option. This book describes what you 
do to become an Internaut (someone who navigates the Internet with skill) — 
how to get started, what you need to know, and where to go for help. And, we 
describe it in plain old English.
When we first wrote The Internet For Dummies 16 years ago (yikes!), a typi­
cal Internet user was a student who connected from college or a technical 
worker who had access through work. The World Wide Web was so new that 
it had only a few hundred pages. The Net has grown like crazy to include 
a billion (dare we say it?) normal people, connecting from computers at 
home or work, along with students ranging from elementary school to adult 
education. This 12th edition focuses on the parts of the Net that are of the 
most interest to typical users — how to find things on the World Wide Web, 
download interesting things from the Net, send and receive electronic mail 
(e-mail), and shop, invest, chat, and play games online.
About This Book
We don’t flatter ourselves to think you’re interested enough in the Internet to 
sit down and read the entire book (although it should be a fine book for the 
bathroom). When you run into a problem using the Internet (“Hmm, I thought 
that I knew how to find somebody on the Net, but I don’t seem to remember”), 
just dip into the book long enough to solve your problem.
Pertinent sections include
	
✓	Understanding what the Internet is
	
✓	Staying safe online
	
✓	The types of Internet connections
	
✓	Climbing around the World Wide Web
	
✓	Finding people, places, and things
	
✓	Communicating by e-mail
	
✓	Hanging out with friends using instant messaging and chat

2
The Internet For Dummies, 12th Edition 
	
✓	Getting stuff from the Net
	
✓	Putting your own stuff online with Web sites and social networks
How to Use This Book
To begin, please read the first two chapters. They give you an overview of the 
Internet and some important safety tips. If you have children or grandchil­
dren, read Chapter 3, too. When you’re ready to get yourself on the Internet, 
turn to Part II and read Chapter 4. Parts III through VI egg you on and provide 
support — they describe the Web and e-mail and other stuff you can do on 
the Internet.
Although we try hard not to introduce a technical term without defining it, 
sometimes we slip. Sometimes, too, you may read a section out of order 
and find a term that we define a few chapters earlier. To fill in the gaps, we 
include a glossary at the end of this book.
Because the Internet is ever-changing, we put additional information online, 
which we can update more often than this book can be republished. The 
Internet For Dummies authors have a Web site with updates, history, and 
other interesting articles, at net.gurus.org.
When you have to follow a complicated procedure, we spell it out step by 
step wherever possible. When you have to type something, it appears in the 
book in boldface. Type it just as it appears. Use the same capitalization we 
do — a few systems care deeply about CAPITAL and small letters. Then press 
the Enter key. The book tells you what should happen when you give each 
command and what your options are.
When you have to choose commands from menus, we write File➪Exit, for 
example, when we want you to choose the File command from the menu bar 
and then choose the Exit command from the menu that appears.
Who Are You?
In writing this book, we made a few assumptions about you:
	
✓	You have or would like to have access to the Internet.
	
✓	You want to get some work done online. (We consider the term work to 
include the concept play.)
	
✓	You aren’t interested in becoming the world’s next great Internet expert, 
at least not this week.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
This book has six parts. The parts stand on their own — although you can 
begin reading wherever you like, you should at least skim Parts I and II first 
to get acquainted with some unavoidable Internet jargon and find out how to 
get your computer on the Net.
Here are the parts of the book:
In Part I, “Welcome to the Internet,” you find out what the Internet is and why 
it’s interesting (at least why we think it’s interesting). Also, this part gives 
you vital Internet terminology and explains concepts that help you as you 
read the later parts of the book. Part I discusses security and privacy issues 
and gives some thoughts about children’s use of the Net.
For the nuts and bolts of getting on the Net, read Part II, “Internet, Here I 
Come!” For most users, by far the most difficult part of using the Net is get­
ting to that first connection, with software loaded, configuration configured, 
and modem modeming or broadband banding broadly. After that, it’s (rela­
tively) smooth sailing.
Part III, “Web Mania,” dives into the World Wide Web, the part of the Internet 
that has powered the Net’s leap from obscurity to fame. We discuss how to 
get around on the Web, how to find stuff (which is not as easy as it should 
be), and how to shop online. We also wrote chapters on downloading music 
and video and managing your finances on the Internet.
Part IV, “E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online,” looks at the 
important Net communication services: sending and receiving e-mail, swap­
ping instant messages, and chatting. You find out how to exchange e-mail 
with people down the hall or on other continents, how to use Internet-based 
phone and video conferencing programs, how to use instant messaging 
programs to chat with your online pals, how to use Twitter, and how to use 
e-mail mailing lists to keep in touch with people of similar interests. You’re 
also briefed on avoiding and blocking online hazards, such as viruses and 
spam. Then we talk about virtual worlds, games, and simulations where many 
people (sometimes very many people) share the experience.
Part V, “Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net,” talks about how to post all kinds 
of material on the Internet. Putting your writing, photos, and videos online 
is easier than ever because of the range of free Web services you can use, 
including blogs, which let anyone be an online journalist. If you want com­
plete control over your Web site, we also give you an overview of how to 
create a Web site with your own domain name.

The Internet For Dummies, 12th Edition 
Part VI, “The Part of Tens,” is composed of a compendium of ready refer­
ences and useful facts (which, we suppose, suggests that the rest of the book 
is full of useless facts).
We stuck the glossary at the end of the book so that it’s easy to find.
A cheat sheet that summarizes how to use the most important Web 
browsers and e-mail programs in this book is online at www.dummies.

Icons Used in This Book
	
Lets you know that some particularly nerdy, technoid information is coming up 
so that you can skip it, if you want. (On the other hand, you may want to read it.)
	
Indicates that a nifty little shortcut or timesaver is explained.
	
Gaack! We found out about this information the hard way! Don’t let it happen 
to you!
	
Indicates something to file away in your memory archives.
What Now?
That’s all you need to know to get started. Whenever you hit a snag using 
the Internet, just look up the problem in the table of contents or index in this 
book. You’ll either have the problem solved in a flash or know where you 
need to go to find some expert help.
Because the Internet has been evolving for more than 30 years, largely under 
the influence of some extremely nerdy people, it wasn’t designed to be par­
ticularly easy for normal people to use. Don’t feel bad if you have to look up a 
number of topics before you feel comfortable using the Internet. Until recently, 
most computer users never had to face anything as complex as the Internet.

The Internet For Dummies, 12th Edition 

Part I
Welcome to the 
Internet

In this part . . .
T
he Internet is an amazing place. But because it’s full of 
computers, everything is more complicated than it 
should be. We start with a look at what the Internet is and 
how it got that way. We tell you what’s happening and 
what people are doing, and why you should care. We pay 
special attention to security problems, privacy issues, and 
family concerns — particularly the knotty question of 
what’s the best way for kids to work with the Internet.

Chapter 1
What’s So Great about 
the Internet, Anyway?
In This Chapter
▶	What, really, is the Internet?
▶	For that matter, what is a network?
▶	What is the Internet good for?
I
t’s huge, it’s sprawling, it’s globe spanning, and it has become part of our 
lives. It must be . . . the Internet. We all know something about it, and 
most of us have tried to use it, with more or less success. (If you’ve had less, 
you’ve come to the right place.) In this chapter, we look at what the Internet 
is and can do before we dive into details in the rest of this book.
If you’re new to the Internet, and especially if you don’t have much computer 
experience, be patient with yourself. Many of the ideas here are completely 
new. Allow yourself some time to read and reread. The Internet is a different 
world with its own language, and it takes some getting used to.
Even experienced computer users can find using the Internet more complex 
than other tasks they’ve tackled. The Internet isn’t a single software package 
and doesn’t easily lend itself to the kind of step-by-step instructions we’d 
provide for a single, fixed program. This book is as step-by-step as we can 
make it, but the Internet resembles a living organism mutating at an astonish­
ing rate more than it resembles Microsoft Word and Excel, which sit quietly 
on your computer. After you get set up and practice a little, using the Internet 
seems like second nature; in the beginning, however, it can be daunting.
So, What Is the Internet?
The Internet — also known as the Net — is the world’s largest computer net­
work. “What is a network?” you may ask. Even if you already know, you may 

10
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
want to read the next couple of paragraphs to make sure that we’re speaking 
the same language.
A computer network is a bunch of computers that communicate with each 
other. It’s sort of like a radio or TV network that connects a bunch of radio or 
TV stations so that they can share the latest episode of American Idol.
Don’t take the analogy too far. In broadcast networking, TV networks send the 
same information to all stations at the same time; in computer networking, 
each particular message is routed to a particular computer, so different com­
puters can display different things. Unlike TV networks, computer networks 
are two-way: When computer A sends a message to computer B, B can send a 
reply back to A.
Some computer networks consist of a central computer and a bunch of 
remote stations that report to it (for example, a central airline-reservation 
computer with thousands of screens and keyboards in airports and travel 
agencies). Other networks, including the Internet, are more egalitarian 
and permit any computer on the network to communicate with any other 
computer. Many new wireless devices — cellphones, Palm handhelds, the 
BlackBerry, iPhones, and their ilk — expand the reach of the Internet right 
into our pockets. (Hands off our wallets!)
The Internet isn’t really one network — it’s a network of networks, all freely 
exchanging information. The networks range from the big, corporate net­
works to tiny ones (such as the one John built in his back bedroom, made 
from a couple of old PCs he bought at an electronics parts store) and every­
thing in between. College and university networks have long been part of the 
Internet, and now high schools and elementary schools are joining in. Lately, 
the Internet has become so popular that many households have more than 
one computer and are creating their own little networks that they connect to 
the Internet.
What’s All the Hoopla?
Everywhere you turn, you can find traces of the Internet. Household products, 
business cards, radio shows, and movie credits list their Web site addresses 
(usually starting with www and ending with “dot com”) and their e-mail 
addresses. New people you meet would rather give you an e-mail address 
than a phone number. Everyone seems to be “going online” and “googling it.”

11
 Chapter 1: What’s So Great about the Internet, Anyway?
The Internet affects our lives on a scale as significant as the telephone and 
television. When it comes to spreading information, the Internet is the most 
significant invention since the printing press. If you use a telephone, write let­
ters, read a newspaper or magazine, or do business or any kind of research, 
the Internet can radically alter your worldview.
On networks, size counts a great deal: The larger a network is, the more stuff 
it has to offer. Because the Internet is the world’s largest interconnected 
group of computer networks, it has an amazing array of information to offer.
When people talk about the Internet, they usually talk about what they can 
do, what they have found, and whom they have met. The number of available 
services is too huge to list in this chapter, but here are the Big Three:
	
✓	Electronic mail (e-mail): This service is certainly the most widely used — 
you can exchange e-mail with millions of people all over the world. 
People use e-mail for anything they might use paper (mail, faxes, special 
delivery of documents) or the telephone (gossip, recipes, love letters) to 
communicate — you name it. (We hear that some people even use it for 
stuff related to work.) Electronic mailing lists enable you to join group 
discussions with people who have similar interests and to meet people 
over the Net. Part IV of this book has all the details.
	
✓	The World Wide Web: When people talk these days about surfing the 
Net, they often mean checking out sites on this (buzzword alert) global 
multimedia hyperlinked database. In fact, people are talking more about 
the Web and less about the Net. Are they the same thing? Technically, 
the answer is “No.” But practically speaking, the answer for many people 
is “Pretty close.” We tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but 
the truth in Part III of this book.
	
	Web sites can provide you with information ranging from travel infor­
mation to how to raise chickens. You can also look at videos, listen to 
music, buy stuff, sell stuff, and play video games.
	
	The software used to navigate the Web is a browser. The most popular 
browsers now are Firefox and Internet Explorer. We tell you all about 
them in Chapters 6 and 7.
	
✓	Instant messaging (IM-ing): Programs such as Windows Live Messenger, 
Yahoo! Messenger, and AOL Instant Messenger let you send messages 
that “pop up” on the recipient’s screen. We hear tales of nimble-fingered 
youth carrying on upward of 13 IM sessions simultaneously. Some Web 
sites also provide messaging services. We tell you about IM programs in 
Chapter 16.

12
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
Why Is This Medium Different 
from Any Other Medium?
The Internet is unlike any other communications media we’ve ever encountered. 
People of all ages, colors, creeds, and countries freely share ideas, stories, 
data, opinions, and products on the Net.
Anybody can access it
One great thing about the Internet is that it’s the most open network in the 
world. Thousands of computers provide facilities that are available to anyone 
who has Internet access. Although pay services exist (and more are added 
every day), most Internet services are free for the taking after you’re online. 
If you don’t already have access to the Internet through your company, your 
school, your library, or a friend, you can pay for access by using an Internet 
service provider (ISP). We talk about some ISPs in Chapter 4.
One of the biggest changes in Net use in the past few years has been the 
move to ever smaller, lighter, and cheaper equipment to connect to it. 
Netbooks are small, cheap computers about the size and weight of this book 
that are mainly intended for connecting to the Net. If a netbook is too big for 
you, smartphones such as the Apple iPhone put a computer, and the Internet, 
in your pocket with an always-on connection.
It’s politically, socially, and 
religiously correct
Another great thing about the Internet is that it is what one may call “socially 
unstratified.” That is, one computer is no better than any other, and no 
person is any better than any other. Who you are on the Internet depends 
solely on how you present yourself through your computer. If what you say 
makes you sound like an intelligent, interesting person, that’s who you are. 
It doesn’t matter how old you are or what you look like or whether you’re 
a student, business executive, or construction worker. Physical disabilities 
don’t matter — we correspond with deaf and blind people. If they hadn’t felt 
like telling us, we never would have known. People become famous (and infa­
mous) in the Internet community as a result of their own efforts.

13
 Chapter 1: What’s So Great about the Internet, Anyway?
The Net advantage
The Internet has become totally mainstream, and you’re falling further 
behind the curve — and at a faster rate — if you haven’t yet gotten started. 
Increasingly, news gets out on the Internet before it’s available any other 
way, and the cyberdeprived are losing ground.
Here are some of the ways people use the Internet:
	
✓	Find information: Many Web sites have information free for the taking. 
Information ranges from IRS tax forms that you can print and use to 
help-wanted ads, real estate listings, and recipes. From U.S. Supreme Court 
decisions and library card catalogs to the text of old books, digitized 
pictures (many suitable for family audiences), and an enormous variety 
of software — from games to operating systems — you can find virtu­
ally anything on the Net. You can check the weather forecast, view 
movie listings, find your childhood sweetheart, browse catalogs, and see 
school closings for anywhere in the world, from anywhere in the world.
	
	Special tools known as search engines and directories help you find 
information (and people) on the Web. See Chapter 8 to find out how to 
search for the information you need.
	
✓	Stay in touch: Weblogs (or blogs) let people and organizations distribute 
current information about themselves rapidly and easily. Microblogs, 
such as Twitter, combine the Net with mobile phone text messages to let 
people stay up to date anywhere, at any time.
Does the Internet really reach every continent?
Some skeptical readers, after reading the 
claim that the Internet spans every continent, 
may point out that Antarctica is a continent, 
even though its population consists largely of 
penguins, who (as far as we know) aren’t inter­
ested in computer networks. Does the Internet 
go there? It does. A few machines at the Scott 
Base on McMurdo Sound in Antarctica are on 
the Internet, connected by radio link to New 
Zealand. The base at the South Pole has a link 
to the United States. See the polar Webcam at 
www.usap.gov.
At the time of this writing, the largest Internet-
free land mass in the world is probably one of the 
uninhabited islands in the Canadian arctic — 
Melville Island, perhaps. (You can look it up 
on the Internet.) We used to say New Guinea, 
a large jungle island north of Australia, until a 
reader there sent us e-mail in 1997 telling us 
about his new Internet provider. Note: If you 
live on Melville Island and you’re online there, 
please e-mail us right away!

✓	Get an education: Schoolteachers coordinate projects with classrooms 
all over the globe. College students and their families exchange e-mail to 
facilitate letter-writing and keep down the cost of phone calls. Students do 
research from their home computers. The latest encyclopedias are online.
	
✓	Buy and sell stuff: On the Internet, you can buy anything from books 
about beermaking to stock in microbreweries. And, you can make some 
cash by cleaning out your closets and selling your old junk on eBay. 
Software companies sell software and provide updates on the Net. Most 
software distribution is migrating to the Internet, where a customer can 
download and install programs without waiting for a CD to arrive. We 
talk about the relevant issues in Chapter 10.
	
✓	Travel: Cities, towns, states, and countries are using the Web to put up 
(or post) tourist and event information. Travelers find weather informa­
tion, maps, and museum hours online, in addition to plane, train, and 
bus schedules and tickets. While you’re at it, you can buy your airplane 
tickets, rent a car, and make your hotel reservations.
	
✓	Use intranets: Businesses have figured out that this Internet concept is 
truly useful, and they create their own, private networks — like mini-
Internets. On these intranets, companies use Web pages for posting 
company information such as benefits, filing expense reports and time 
sheets, and ordering supplies. An intranet helps an organization provide 
information that employees can see from inside the company that folks 
on the outside can’t see, including manuals, forms, videos of boring 
meetings, and, of course, endless memos. In some organizations, e-mail 
and intranets reduce the amount of paper wasted on this stuff.
	
✓	Play games: Internet-based multiuser games can easily absorb all your 
waking hours and an alarming number of what would otherwise be your 
sleeping hours. You can challenge other players who can be anywhere in 
the world. Many kinds of games are available on the Web, including such 
traditionally addictive games as bridge, hearts, chess, checkers, and go. 
In Chapter 17, we tell you where to find these games.
	
✓	Find love: People are finding romance on the Net. Singles ads and 
matchmaking sites vie for users. The Internet long ago grew beyond the 
original bunch of socially challenged 22-year-old nerdy guys and now 
has turned into the world’s biggest matchmaker, for people of all ages, 
genders, preferences, and life situations.
	
✓	Heal: Patients and doctors keep up-to-date with the latest medical findings, 
share treatment experience, and give one another support around 
medical problems. We even know of some practitioners who exchange 
e-mail directly with their patients.

15
 Chapter 1: What’s So Great about the Internet, Anyway?
	
✓	Invest: People do financial research, buy stock, and invest money 
online. Some online companies trade their own shares. Investors are 
finding new ventures, and new ventures are finding capital.
	
✓	Participate in nonprofits: Churches, synagogues, mosques, schools, 
clubs, teen centers, and other community organizations put up pages 
telling Web users about themselves and inviting new people. The online 
church newsletter always comes before Sunday.
Okay, What Next?
If you’re ready to jump on the Internet, first read Chapter 2 for some safety 
tips. If you have children (or grandchildren), read Chapter 3 about what kids 
should (and shouldn’t) do online.
Done? Chapter 4 tells you how to get connected!
Where did the Internet come from?
The ancestor of the Internet was the ARPANET, 
a project funded by the Department of Defense 
(DOD) in 1969, as an experiment in reliable net­
working and to link DOD and military research 
contractors, including the large number of 
universities doing military-funded research. 
(ARPA stands for Advanced Research Projects 
Administration, the branch of the DOD in charge 
of handing out grant money. For enhanced con­
fusion, the agency is now known as DARPA — 
the added D is for Defense, in case anyone had 
doubts about where the money was coming 
from.) Although the ARPANET started small — 
connecting three computers in California with 
one in Utah — it quickly grew to span the 
continent.
In the early 1980s, the ARPANET grew into the 
early Internet, a group of interlinked networks
connecting many educational and research 
sites funded by the National Science 
Foundation (NSF), along with the original mili­
tary sites. By 1990, it was clear that the Internet 
was here to stay, and DARPA and the NSF 
bowed out in favor of the commercially run net­
works that make up today’s Internet. (And, yes, 
although Al Gore didn’t invent the Internet, he 
was instrumental in keeping it funded so that 
it could turn into the Internet we know now.) 
Familiar companies such as AT&T, Comcast, 
Sprint, and Verizon run some of the networks; 
others belong to specialty companies, such as 
Level3 and Cogent. No matter which one you’re 
attached to, they all interconnect, so it’s all one, 
giant Internet. For more information, read our 
Web page at net.gurus.org/history.

Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
Turn off the computer now and then
We can tell you from experience that when 
you’re on the Net, the hands on the clock 
slow down and stop and you can spend more 
time online than you could imagine. For some 
people, it’s impossible to go ten minutes without 
checking e-mail, dirty dishes are ignored while 
visiting just one more Web page, and it gets to 
the point where it could be Internet Addiction. 
Remember that the Net is a fine adjunct to real 
life — not a substitute.
As our friend and longtime Net user Jean Polly 
regularly says: The Internet is closing! Go out­
side and play!

Is the Internet Safe? Viruses, 
Spyware, Spam, and 
Other Yucky Stuff
In This Chapter
▶	Taking a look at the dangers that lurk on the Net
▶	Protecting your online privacy
▶	Understanding how viruses can infect your computer
▶	Preventing spyware-makers from installing unwanted software on your PC
▶	Controlling how much junk e-mail you’re stuck looking at
▶	Keeping yourself and your family safe online
W
e like the Internet. It has been part of our lives — and livelihoods — 
for years. We’d love to tell you that all the stuff you may have read 
about the dangers of connecting a computer to the Internet is hype. We can’t. 
The success of the Internet has attracted unsavory people who view you as 
a money tree ready to be plucked. (Nothing personal — they see everybody 
that way.) In a few countries, perpetrating Internet fraud is now a major part 
of the national economy.
Even if no one steals your money, information about your online activities can 
be gathered and result in a real loss of privacy. And, some people are trying to 
take over your computer so that they can use it for nefarious purposes. When 
a new computer is hooked up to the Internet, it’s not a question of whether it 
will come under cyberattack, but when. And, the answer is measured not in 
months or days — but in hours or minutes.
When you combine the Internet with cellphones and global positioning 
systems (GPSs), privacy issues become even scarier. Cellphone providers 
can tell where you are whenever you have your phone with you. And, phones 
or other Internet-connected devices that contain a GPS can help you find your 
way around, but they can also report on your whereabouts.

18
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
Relax: The Internet doesn’t have to be a dangerous place. Using the Internet 
is like walking around a big city — yes, you need to be careful, use some pro­
tection, and stay out of dangerous areas, but you can also safely take advantage 
of the wonders that the Net has to offer.
This chapter describes the types of issues that abound on the Internet:
	
✓	Privacy issues involve how much people can find out about you over 
the Internet.
	
✓	Security issues have to do with keeping control over which programs 
are running on your computer.
	
✓	Just plain annoyance issues include ending up with a mailbox full of spam 
(junk e-mail) or Web browser windows popping up with advertisements.
Throughout the rest of this book, we include instructions for staying safe 
by using a firewall, a virus checker, a spyware scanner, and some common 
sense. Chapter 3 talks about rules for letting kids use the Internet, and most 
of the suggestions make sense for grown-ups, too.
Privacy: Who’s Who and What 
They Can Tell about You
Advances in technology are eroding the privacy that most of us take for granted. 
Innovations we use every day — credit cards, cellphones, electronic key 
cards, and automobile tollway transponders — allow our every purchase and 
movement to be tracked. The Internet is an extension of this trend. Much of 
what you do online can be watched and recorded — sometimes for innocent 
reasons and sometimes not.
All this is further compounded by the amount of publicly available infor­
mation that is now conveniently available to a far greater public over the 
Internet. When paper records were kept by government officials and people 
had to visit the office and dig through the files for the specific information 
they wanted, a lot less information abuse was possible. Now the potential 
exists for anyone anywhere to access information about people hitherto 
unknown, and to gather information from various sources, including online 
directories. No longer are geography or time deterrents enough.
Some people worry that snoops on the Net will intercept their private e-mail 
or Web pages. That’s quite unlikely, actually. The more serious problem is 
advertisers who build profiles of the sites you visit and the stuff you buy. 
Most Web ads are provided by a handful of companies, such as DoubleClick.
com (Google), Advertising.com (AOL), and Razorfish (Microsoft), who can 
use their ads to determine that the same person (you) is visiting a lot of 

19
 Chapter 2: Is the Internet Safe? Viruses, Spyware, Spam, and Other Yucky Stuff
different Web sites. Using this information, these companies can create a pro­
file. They say that they don’t create these personal profiles, but they don’t 
say they won’t in the future.
Several techniques for gathering information about you as you use the 
Internet, or tricking you into providing information, are described in the next 
few sections.
Who is the party to whom I am speaking?
Although the Internet seems completely anonymous, it’s not. People used to 
have Internet usernames that bore some resemblance to their true identities — 
their names or initials or some such combination in conjunction with their 
university or corporation names gave a fairly traceable route to real people. 
Creating a new e-mail address now takes just a few minutes, so revealing your 
identity is definitely optional.
Depending on who you are and what you want to do on the Net, you may, in 
fact, want different names and different accounts. Here are some legitimate 
reasons for wanting them:
	
✓	You’re a professional — a physician, for example — and you want to 
participate in a mailing list or newsgroup without being asked for your 
professional opinion.
	
✓	You want help with an area of concern that you feel is private and you 
don’t want your problem known to people close to you who may find 
out if your name is associated with it.
	
✓	You do business on the Internet, and you socialize on it. You may want 
to keep those activities separate.
	
Most Net activities can be traced. If you start to abuse the anonymous nature 
of the Net, you’ll find that you’re not so anonymous after all.
Safety first
	
The anonymous, faceless nature of the Internet has its downside, too. To 
protect you and your family, take these simple precautions:
	
✓	When posting information that appears on a public Web site (other than 
your own) or in any discussion venue, don’t use your full name. This 
advice doesn’t apply if you’re working in a business context, such as 
posting information on your company’s Web site.
	
✓	Never provide your name, address, or phone number to someone you 
don’t know.

20
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
	
✓	Never believe anyone who says that he’s from “AOL Tech Support,” “eBay 
Fraud Prevention,” “PayPal Administration,” or some such authority and 
asks you for your password. No legitimate entity will ever ask you for 
your password.
	
✓	Be especially careful about disclosing information about kids. Don’t fill 
out profiles that ask for a kid’s name, hometown, school, age, address, or 
phone number, because they’re invariably used for “targeted marketing” 
(also known as junk mail).
Although relatively rare, horrible things have happened to a few people who 
have taken their Internet encounters into real life. Many wonderful things 
have happened, too. We’ve met some of our best friends over the Net, and 
some people have met and subsequently married. We just want to encour­
age you to use common sense when you set up a meeting with a Net friend. 
A person you e-mail or swap instant messages with is still largely a stranger, 
and if you want to meet in person, take the same precautions you would on a 
first date with someone you don’t know: Meet in a public place, perhaps with 
a friend along, and be sure that your family knows where you are and when 
you’re planning to be back.
The Net is a wonderful place, and meeting new people and making new friends 
is one of the big attractions. We just want to make sure that you’re as careful 
as you would be in the rest of your life.
Phishing for inphormation
Phishing is the fastest-growing Internet crime, and you’re the target. The good 
news is that protecting yourself is easy when you and your family know how 
to spot the phish-hook.
Learn what phishing looks like. After you start using the Internet and receiv­
ing e-mail (as described in Chapter 13), there’s an excellent chance that you’ll 
receive a message like this one:

Sounds authentic and scary, doesn’t it? Think you had better deal with this 
message right away? Better think again. You are the phish, and this message 
is the bait. That underlined text in the middle is the hook. Click it and soon 
an official-looking page appears that looks just like an eBay sign-in page. After 
you enter your username and password, another official-looking page asks 
for your credit card number, PIN, billing address, checking account details 
(complete with a helpful graphic so that you can find the right numbers 
on your personal checks), Social Security number, date of birth, mother’s 
maiden name, and driver’s license number. The page is smart enough to 
reject an invalid credit card number. If you fill in all the information and press 
Continue, you see a valid eBay page that says you’ve logged out. Then, who 
knows? The bad guys know enough about you to do anything from making 
a small purchase paid for by your credit card to full-scale identity theft that 
can take months or years to straighten out.
This message did not come from eBay. Millions of these types of messages 
are sent over the Internet every day.
Some clues might alert you. The misspelled words recieved and informations 
suggest that the author is someone whose English skills are limited. And, if 
you take the trouble to save the e-mail to a file and then print it, the under­
lined link in the middle of the message looks like this:

22
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
The text between the angle brackets (< and >) is where the link really goes, 
to a Web site with a numeric address. (When we tried clicking the link two 
days after we got the mail, the Web site had already been shut down. Those 
eBay security folks are on the ball.)
Don’t take the bait
	
Phishers have gotten a lot more skillful since the earliest phishes a decade 
ago, and now often have good editors and use a spell checker, so you can’t 
rely on spelling and grammar mistakes, although they’re dead giveaways when 
you spot them. Here are a few additional tips:
	
✓	Assume that every e-mail that leads you to a page seeking passwords 
or credit card numbers or other personal information is a phishing 
expedition.
	
✓	If the e-mail purports to be from a company you’ve never heard of, 
ignore it.
	
✓	If the message says that it’s from a company with whom you have an 
account, go to the company’s Web site by typing the company’s URL into 
your browser (see Chapter 7), not by clicking a link in the e-mail. When 
you get to the company’s Web site, look for a My Account link. When you 
log in there, if there’s a problem, you should see a notice. If there’s no 
way to log in and you’re still concerned, forward a copy of the e-mail to 
the customer service department.
One trick phishers use to fool Internet users is Web site spoofing — tricking 
your browser into displaying one address when you’re actually at another 
site. Some browsers allow a Web site to show only its main address so that 
it doesn’t look so geeky. Phishers take advantage of this ability. Better Web 
browsers offer protection against Web site spoofing — they always show the 
actual Web address of the page you’re on.
To summarize, make sure that your family knows this rule well: Never, never, 
never enter passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information 
at a Web page you opened by clicking a link in an e-mail.
Web bugs track the ads you read
Ever since the World Wide Web became a household word (okay, three words), 
companies have increasingly viewed their Internet presence as a vital way to 
advertise their goods and services and conduct their business. They spend 
millions of dollars on their Web sites and advertising e-mail (the legitimate 

23
 Chapter 2: Is the Internet Safe? Viruses, Spyware, Spam, and Other Yucky Stuff
kind you actually asked for) — and want very much to know just how people 
use them. Small wonder that when you visit a site, companies can keep track 
of your actions as you go from link to link within the site. But they really want 
to know what you were doing before you entered their sites — and even more 
they want to know whether you read their mail. To gather this intelligence, 
they insert tiny images in mail messages that they call Web beacons and every­
one else calls Web bugs that report your actions back to the mailer.
Most mail programs offer the option not to fetch any of the images in mail 
messages from unknown or untrusted senders, which stops Web bugs and 
also makes your mail reading faster.
Cookies aren’t so bad
When you browse the Web (as described in Chapter 6), the Web server 
needs to know who you are if you want to do things that require logging in, 
putting items in a virtual shopping cart, or completing any other process 
that requires that the Web site remember information about you as you 
move from page to page. The most commonly used trick that allows Web 
sites to keep track of what you’re doing is setting cookies. A cookie is a tiny 
file, stored on your computer, that contains the address of the Web site and 
codes that your browser sends back to the Web site every time you visit a 
page there. Cookies usually don’t contain personal or dangerous information; 
they’re mostly innocuous and — believe it or not — useful.
If you plan to shop on the Web (described in Chapter 10) or use other Web 
services, cookies make it all possible. When you’re using an airline reserva­
tion site, for example, the site uses cookies to separate the flights you’re 
reserving from the ones that other users are reserving at the same time. On 
the other hand, you might use your credit card to purchase something on a 
Web site and the site uses a cookie to remember the account with your credit 
card number. Suppose that you provide this information from a computer 
at work and the next person to visit that site uses the same computer. That 
person could, possibly, make purchases on your credit card. Oops.
Internet users have various feelings about cookies. Some of us don’t care 
about them, and some of us view them as an unconscionable invasion of pri­
vacy. You get to decide for yourself. Contrary to rumor, cookie files cannot 
get other information from your hard disk, give you a bad haircut, or other­
wise mess up your life. They collect only information that the browser tells 
them about. Your Web browser lets you control whether and when cookies 
are stored on your computer; see Chapter 7 for details.

24
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
The Web browser equivalents of Web bugs are tracking cookies. If several 
Web sites show ads from the same advertising network, the ad network can 
use cookies to tell whenever you’re looking at one of their ads. By piecing 
together the information from many Web sites, these tracking companies 
get a clear picture of where you go online — and what you look at when you 
get there. Many are careful to provide only statistical information to their 
clients, but the potential for abuse is there. It’s worth noting that U.S. courts 
set a lower standard of protection for “business records” gathered in this 
way than they do for personal papers stored in our homes. Fortunately, most 
Web browsers provide an option to reject third-party cookies, or cookies from 
anyone other than the source of the Web page itself; this makes tracking 
cookies go away.
We know where you are
Cellphones and GPSs don’t make the privacy situation simple. Anyone with 
a cellphone can take pictures or video of you and e-mail them to friends or 
post them to the Web, which can be anywhere from innocent fun to citizen 
journalism to seriously creepy. (We’ve read news reports of people standing 
at the foot of stairwells and escalators and trying to take pictures up girls’ 
skirts. Ewww.) Modern cellphones have built-in GPS receivers, primarily 
intended to provide your location if you call 911, but also potentially usable 
to track your location whenever the phone is on.
Security: How People Can 
Take Over Your PC
You can download and install software directly over the Internet, which is a 
wonderful feature. It’s wonderful when you need a viewer program to display 
and print a tax form or when you want to install a free upgrade to a program that 
you purchased earlier. How convenient! We tell you all about it in Chapter 12.
However, other people can also install programs on your computer without 
your permission. Hey, wait a minute — whose computer is it, anyway? These 
programs can arrive in a number of ways, mainly by e-mail or your Web 
browser.

25
 Chapter 2: Is the Internet Safe? Viruses, Spyware, Spam, and Other Yucky Stuff
Viruses arrive by e-mail
Computer viruses are programs that jump from computer to computer, just 
as real viruses jump from person to person. Computer viruses can spread 
using any mechanism that computers use to talk to each other, like networks, 
data CDs, and DVDs. Viruses have been around computers for a long time. 
Originally, viruses lived in program files that people downloaded using a 
file transfer program or their Web browsers. Now, most viruses are spread 
by opening files that are sent by e-mail, as attachments to mail messages, 
although instant messaging (IM; see Chapter 16) is a popular alternative.
There was a time long ago when people in the know (like we thought we 
were) laughed at newcomers to the Internet who worried about getting 
viruses by e-mail. E-mail messages back then were just text files and could 
not contain programs. Then e-mail attachments were introduced. People 
could then send computer software — including those sneaky viruses — by 
e-mail. Isn’t progress wonderful?
What viruses do
When a virus lands on your computer, it has to manage somehow to get 
executed. Getting executed in computer jargon means being brought to life; 
a virus is a program, and programs have to be run in order to start doing 
their nefarious work. After a virus is running, it does two things:
Google yourself
One big attraction of the Internet is all that data 
out there that is now quite easy to access. Some 
of that data is about you. If you have your own 
blog or a personal Web site (see Chapters 19 
and 20), you expect that all the information you 
put up there is available for everyone to see — 
usually, forever. (We find stuff about ourselves 
from over 25 years ago.) Other people also put 
up information — newsletters, event listings, 
pictures from events, and other pictures, for 
example. Your online data trail may be longer 
than you think. If you haven’t done it before, 
search the Web for your own name. Enter your 
name in quotes in the Google or Bing search 
box and press Enter. If you have a common 
name, you may need to throw in your middle 
initial or add the name of your town or school. 
(If you do this often, you’re ego surfing.)

26
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
	
1.	 The virus looks around and tries to find your address book, which it 
uses to courteously send copies of itself to all your friends and acquain­
tances, often wrapped up in very convincing-sounding messages (“Hey, 
enjoyed the other night, thought this file would amuse you!”).
	
2.	 Then the virus executes its payload, the reason the virus writer went 
through all that trouble and risk. (They do occasionally end up in jail.)
The payload is the illegal activity that the virus is running from your machine. 
A payload can record your every keystroke (including your passwords). It 
can launch an attack at specific or random targets over the Internet. It fre­
quently sends spam from your computer. Whatever it’s doing, you don’t want 
it to do. Trust us. If your computer starts to act quirky or extremely sluggish, 
chances are, you’ve contracted a virus or 20.
In the good old days, virus writers were content just to see their viruses 
spread, but like everything else about the Internet, virus writing is now a big 
business, in many cases controlled by organized crime syndicates.
What you can do about viruses
Don’t worry too much about viruses — excellent virus-checking programs 
are available that check all incoming mail before the viruses can attack. In 
Chapter 4, which describes getting connected to the Internet, we recommend 
installing a virus checker. After you install it, be sure to update it regularly so 
that you’re always protected against the latest viruses.
Worms come right over the Net
A worm resembles a virus, except that it doesn’t need to hitch a ride on an 
e-mail message. A worm just jumps directly from one computer to another 
over the Net, entering your computer by way of security flaws in its network 
software. Unfortunately, the most popular type of network software on the 
Net, the kind in Microsoft Windows, is riddled with security holes, so many 
that if you attach a nice, fresh Windows machine to a broadband Net connec­
tion, the machine becomes overrun with worms in less than a minute.
If you rigorously apply all security updates from Microsoft, they fix most 
of the known security flaws, but it takes a lot longer than a minute to apply 
them all. Hence, we strongly encourage anyone using a broadband connec­
tion to use a hardware firewall, a box that sits between the Net and your 
computer and keeps the worms out. If you have a broadband connection, you 
probably want to use an inexpensive device called a router to hook up your 
computers, anyway, and all routers include a firewall as a standard feature. 
See Chapter 4 for more information.

27
 Chapter 2: Is the Internet Safe? Viruses, Spyware, Spam, and Other Yucky Stuff
Spyware arrives via Web sites
Spyware (which includes adware) is like a virus, except that your computer 
catches it in a different way. Rather than arrive by e-mail, spyware is down­
loaded by your browser. Generally, you need to click something on a Web 
page to download and install spyware, but many people have been easily 
misled into installing spyware that purports to be a graphics viewer or 
another type of program they think they might want.
Know what spyware does
Spyware got its name from being frequently used for sneaky purposes, like 
spying on what you’re typing. Sometimes, spyware gathers information about 
you and sends it off to another site without your knowledge or consent. A 
common use for spyware is finding out which sites you’re visiting so that 
advertisers can display pop-up ads (described later in this chapter) that are 
targeted to your interests.
Targeted advertising isn’t inherently evil. The Google AdSense program, for 
example, places ads on participating Web pages based on the contents of 
those pages. Targeted ads are worth more to advertisers because you’re more 
likely to respond to an ad about something you’re already reading about.
Spyware can also send spam from your computer, capture every keystroke 
you type and send it to a malefactor over the Net, and do all the other Bad 
Things that worms and viruses do.
Are Macs the solution?
We hear you Apple Macintosh users gloating 
as you read this chapter: “We don’t have these 
problems. Why don’t people just use Macs?” 
Mac users still have to put up with phishing 
and other forms of junk e-mail, and spyware has 
started to appear on Macs. But to date, almost 
none of the viruses or worms affects Macs, 
and the threat of spyware is lower than for PCs. 
Although this situation could change, we think 
that Mac users will always have an easier time 
on the Net. First, Macs are so scarce (com­
pared to Windows machines) that it’s not worth 
a virus writer’s time to attack them — partly 
because this scarcity also makes it hard to 
spread Mac viruses. Most e-mail addresses in 
a Mac user’s address book belong to Windows 
users anyway, so if a Mac virus makes copies 
of itself, the copies it mails out don’t find nice, 
vulnerable homes. (Designing a virus that will 
run on both Windows and Macs is hard, even 
today.) Finally, the Mac OS X is designed to be 
more secure than Windows and is harder to 
infect.
Current Intel-based Macs can run Windows 
programs, or can even be set up to run native 
Windows, for applications that are Windows-
only. We know of companies whose support 
staffs run everything on Macs — because they 
don’t get infected. When employees need to run 
something on a PC, they do it in a window on the 
Mac screen. Cool.

Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
Don’t voluntarily install spyware
	
Lots of cute little free programs are available for download, but don’t install 
them unless you’re convinced that they’re safe and useful. Most free toolbars, 
screen savers, news tickers, and other utilities are spyware in disguise. Besides, 
the more programs you run on your computer, the slower all your other pro­
grams run. Check with friends before downloading the latest program. Or, 
search the Web for the program’s name (see Chapter 8) to find positive or nega­
tive reviews. Download programs only from reputable Web sites. Keep your 
computer free from software clutter.
Protect your computer from spyware
Spyware programs are often designed to be hard to remove — which can 
mess up your operating system. Rather than wait until you contract a bad 
case of spyware and then try to uninstall it, a better idea is to inoculate your 
computer against spyware. To block spyware, be careful about the screen 
elements you click. Install a spyware checking program that can scan your 
system periodically, such as the free Microsoft Windows Defender. See 
Chapter 4 for details.
Be aware that spyware can attack Macs and even phones
Macintosh computers aren’t immune to spyware. (See the nearby sidebar, 
“Are Macs the solution?”) The Macintosh operating system is inherently 
more secure than Windows, so few viruses and little spyware can attack it. 
However, a Mac user is just as likely as a PC user to be fooled into clicking 
a link to a free porn site that downloads spyware to your computer along with 
that sexy video. Even smartphones (like the iPhone or Palm Pre) can be infected 
with spyware, and although most spyware targets Windows, it also targets other 
kinds of computers and phones, so think before you click on all these devices.
Adware: Just another kind of spyware
Adware, a controversial type of software 
that many people consider to be spyware, is 
installed as part of some programs that are dis­
tributed for free. It watches what you do on your 
computer and displays targeted ads — even 
when you run other programs. We think that 
no users in their right minds would knowingly 
install a program that peppers them with ads — 
and we want laws to ban the practice, pointing 
out that adware often behaves like a parasite, 
by obscuring or replacing ads from competing 
Web sites.
Before downloading a free program, make sure 
that you understand what the deal is. If you 
aren’t sure, don’t download it. Make sure that 
your kids know not to download free games, 
song lyrics, and the like — most are infested 
with adware. If you don’t, before you know it, 
you’ll have so many pop-up ads that you’ll have 
to unplug your computer to shut it up.

29
 Chapter 2: Is the Internet Safe? Viruses, Spyware, Spam, and Other Yucky Stuff
Pop-up browser windows pop 
up all over the place
One of the worst innovations in recent decades is the pop-up window that 
appears on your screen unbidden (by you) when you visit some Web sites. 
Some pop-ups appear immediately, and others are pop-unders, which are 
hidden under your main window until you close the main window. The pop-
ups you’re most likely to see are ads for mortgages and airline tickets. (No, 
we don’t give their names here; they have plenty of publicity already.)
Several mechanisms can make pop-ups appear on your computer:
	
✓	A Web site can open a new browser window. Sometimes this new 
window displays an ad or other annoying information. But sometimes 
the new window has useful information — some Web sites use pop-up 
windows as a sort of Help system for using the site.
	
✓	Spyware or other programs can display pop-up windows.
Luckily, Web browsers now can prevent most Web sites from opening 
unwanted new browser windows. See Chapter 7 to find out how to tell your 
browser how to display fewer pop-ups.
What’s the secret word, Mr. Potter?
Everywhere you go these days, someone wants you to enter a password or 
passcode. Even Harry Potter has to tell his password to a magic portrait just 
to enter the Gryffindor dormitory (although there’s apparently no security 
between the boys’ and girls’ wings). Security experts are nearly unanimous in 
telling us how we should protect all our passwords:
	
✓	Pick passwords that are long and complex enough that no one can 
guess them.
	
	Never use as a password a word that occurs in the dictionary. Consider 
sticking a number or two into your password.
	
✓	Never use the same password for different accounts.
	
✓	Memorize your passwords and never write them down.
	
✓	Change your passwords frequently.
	
✓	Check the strength of your passwords. This Microsoft site can help: 
microsoft.com/protect/yourself/password/checker.mspx.
This sound advice is intended for everyone — except ordinary human beings. 
Most of us have far too many passwords to keep track of and too little brain 
to store them in.

30
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
One common-sense approach is to use a single password for accounts where 
there’s little risk of loss, such as the one you need in order to read an online 
newspaper. Use separate, stronger passwords for the accounts that truly 
matter (such as your online banking). If you feel you can’t remember them 
all, write them down and keep them in a safe place, not on a PostIt note stuck 
to your monitor.
Our warning about not using a password that’s in the dictionary — take that 
one seriously! Hackers managed to find a hole in our firewall one day, and we 
had stupidly left one password set to a normal English word (weather, if you 
must know). It took the hackers less than two hours to break into our com­
puter, by simply having their computer type every English word until they 
found one that worked.
	
When making up a password, stick numbers and punctuation into words or 
glue two words together with some numbers or spell things backward. Use 
both capital and lowercase letters, too. If your kids are Fred and Susie and 
your house number is 426, how about Fred426susiE? Or Susie426dreF? Using 
The perils of free Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi, the wireless way that your laptop can 
connect to the Internet, is available in many 
public places, including airports and coffee 
shops. As we explain in Chapter 4, when you 
use Wi-Fi to connect your computer to the 
Internet, you locate the network and click 
Connect and then start using the Internet. One 
of the first things you’ll probably do is use your 
Web browser to check your e-mail or connect 
to your company’s network, And, in the pro­
cess, you type a password or two.
Can you trust the Wi-Fi network? How do you 
know that the Wi-Fi network isn’t listening to 
what you type, including your passwords? Well, 
you don’t.
Wi-Fi spoofing is surprisingly easy. A thief sets 
up a computer in an airport lounge or coffee 
shop by using the same Wi-Fi system identifier, 
and you connect to her Wi-Fi rather than to the 
real one. She monitors what you type and uses 
your passwords to send spam or empty your 
bank account or perform other nefarious deeds.
What’s a traveling Internet user to do? Answer: 
Don’t use free Wi-Fi unless you know for sure 
that it’s legit. (For example, your kids’ school or 
your company may provide free Wi-Fi on the 
school or company grounds.) If you absolutely 
must use public Wi-Fi to check your e-mail while 
you’re on the road, here’s what to do (advice 
courtesy of our friend Mark Steinwinter):
	 1.	 Before you leave on your trip, change your 
e-mail password (and any other password 
you plan to use).
	 2.	 While on your trip, limit your public Wi-Fi 
use to accounts whose passwords you just 
changed. Go ahead and use Web sites that 
don’t require a password.
	 3.	 As soon as you get home, change your 
e-mail password again. You can change it 
back to what it was before your trip, or to 
another password. Just assume that a Bad 
Guy has the password you used on your 
trip, and never use this password again.

31
 Chapter 2: Is the Internet Safe? Viruses, Spyware, Spam, and Other Yucky Stuff
the first letters of each word in a phrase is a good method, too. If your favorite 
song is “I Wanna Hold Your Hand,” it wouldn’t be that hard to remember a 
password like Iwhyh1963. You get the idea!
Over the years, we’ve ended up with so many passwords that we started 
storing them in a text file — which anyone with access to our PC could read! 
This idea is certainly one of the world’s worst. If you have a lot of passwords 
and no way to remember them, consider using a password manager, which 
is designed to store your passwords in a safe place. Of course, you have to 
remember one password — for your password manager. We use KeePass, a 
freeware, open source program that you can download from www.keepass.
info for PCs and Macs. See Chapter 12 to find out how to download and 
install programs.
Spam, Bacon, Spam, Eggs, and Spam
Pink tender morsel,
Glistening with salty gel.
What the hell is it?
	
— SPAM haiku, found on the Internet, sometimes credited to 
Christopher James Hume.
More and more often, we get unsolicited bulk e-mail (abbreviated UBE but 
usually called spam) from some organization or person we don’t know. Spam 
is the online version of junk mail. Offline, junk mailers have to pay postage. 
Unfortunately, online, the cost of sending out a bazillion pieces of junk mail is 
virtually zilch.
E-mail spam (not to be confused with SPAM, a meat-related product from 
Minnesota and very popular in Hawaii) means that thousands of copies of an 
unwanted message are sent to e-mail accounts and even to instant message 
programs. The message usually consists of unsavory advertising for get-
rich-quick schemes or pornographic offers — something you might not want 
to see and something you definitely don’t want your children to see. Many 
spam messages tout worthless stocks that the spammers have bought and 
hope you’ll buy at inflated prices. The message is spam, the practice is spam­
ming, and the person sending the spam is a spammer. Phishing often involves 
spam, too.
Spam, unfortunately, is a major problem on the Internet because it’s 
extremely cheap for sleazy advertisers to send. We receive hundreds or thou­
sands of pieces of spam a day, and the number continues to increase. Spam 
doesn’t have to be commercial (we’ve seen religious and political spam), but 
it has to be unsolicited; if you asked for it, it isn’t spam.

32
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
Why it’s called spam
The meat? SPAM might be short for spiced ham. Oh, you mean the unwanted 
e-mail? It came from the Monty Python skit in which a group of Vikings sing 
the word spam repeatedly in a march tempo, drowning out all other dis­
course. (Search for Monty Python spam at your favorite search engine and 
you’ll find plenty of sites where you can listen to it.) Spam can drown out all 
other mail because some people receive so much spam that they stop using 
e-mail entirely.
Why it’s so bad
You may think that spam, like postal junk mail, is just a nuisance we have 
to live with. But it’s worse than junk mail, in several ways. Spam costs you 
money. E-mail recipients pay much more than the sender does to deliver a 
message. Sending e-mail is cheap: A spammer can send thousands of mes­
sages an hour from a PC. After that, it costs you time to download, read (at 
least the subject line), and dispose of the mail. The amount of spam is now 
about 20 times the amount of real e-mail, and if spam volume continues to 
grow at its alarming pace, pretty soon real e-mail will prove to be useless 
Be careful with password hints
Web site operators are tired of dealing with 
customers who forget their passwords, so a 
new computer tool has emerged in the past 
few years — the password hint. When you 
create a new account, the friendly identity 
manager software asks for your username and 
new password. It then makes you select and 
answer a couple of security questions, such as 
“What’s your favorite color?” or “What’s your 
pet’s name?”
Sometime in the future, you try to log in to that 
account — and find that you forgot that pesky 
password. No problemo! You’re asked the 
security questions you picked; if you type the 
right answer, you’re in. The problem is that a 
thief pretending to be you sees the same chal­
lenge. Rather than guess your password, all 
he has to guess is your favorite color (blue, 
maybe?) and figure out your pet’s name (and 
did your kid post captioned photos of Rover on 
the school Web site as part of his third grade 
computer-literacy project?).
If you encounter one of these password hints 
when you sign up for an important account, pick 
questions whose answers an attacker can’t 
glean by researching you. And, there’s no rule 
that says you have to answer the security ques­
tions truthfully. You can pick a friend’s pet, for 
example, or a color you detest, or you can say 
that your favorite color is Rover and your pet’s 
name is Purple. You just have to remember your 
less-than-truthful answers to these questions.

33
 Chapter 2: Is the Internet Safe? Viruses, Spyware, Spam, and Other Yucky Stuff
because it’s buried under the junk. Another problem is that spam filters, 
which are supposed to discard only spam, can throw away good messages by 
mistake.
Not only do spam recipients have to bear a cost, but all this volume of e-mail 
also strains the resources of the e-mail servers and the entire Internet. ISPs 
have to pass along the added costs to its users. Spam volume doubled or 
tripled for many years, peaking in 2008, dropping back a bit in early 2009 
when a few major spam sources were shut down, but is expected to keep 
growing quickly. America Online has estimated that more than 95 percent of 
its incoming e-mail is spam, and many ISPs have told us that as much as $2 of 
the $20 monthly fee goes to handling and cleaning up after spam. Spammers 
send 100 billion spam messages every day. And, as ISPs try harder to filter 
out spam, more and more legitimate mail is being mistaken for spam and 
bounced.
	
Many spam messages include a line that instructs you how to get off their 
lists, something like “Send us a message with the word REMOVE in it.” Don’t 
bother — they don’t remove you from their lists, and you may well receive 
more spam now that they know your address is a good one. Reply to mes­
sages or click links to unsubscribe only if the messages are from lists that you 
remember subscribing to or from companies you have done business with.
What you can do about it
You don’t have to put up with a lot of spam. Spam filters can weed out most 
of the spam you receive. See Chapter 14 to see how to use the spam filter that 
may already be built into your e-mail program or how to install a separate 
spam filtering program. Also visit www.cauce.org, the Coalition Against 
Unsolicited E-mail, the major grass roots antispam organization.
Safety: How to Keep Yourself 
and Your Family Safe
	
Viruses, spyware, phishing, pop-ups, spam — is the Internet worth all this 
trouble? No, you don’t have to give up on the Internet in despair or disgust. 
You just have to put in a little extra effort to use it safely. In addition to the 
technological fixes we suggest (virus checkers, spyware scanners, and pop-up 
blockers), you need to develop some smarts about online security. Here’s a 
quick checklist:
	
✓	Develop healthy skepticism. If it sounds too good to be true, it isn’t 
true. No one in Africa has $25 million they will share with you if you 

34
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
help them get it out of the country, nor did you win a sweepstakes you 
never entered. As the old saying goes, there’s a fool born every minute. 
Today’s sucker doesn’t have to be you.
	
✓	Keep your computer’s software up-to-date. Both Microsoft and Apple 
have features that make this a more or less painless process. Use them. 
The latest software updates usually fix exploitable security flaws.
	
✓	Use a firewall and keep it updated. Your computer probably has fire­
wall software built in. Make sure that your firewall is turned on. Some 
malware programs know how to turn off protective software, so check 
it every week or so. We recommend using a router — a device that lets 
you share Internet connections among several computers (whether 
wired or wireless) — because routers include built-in firewall programs 
that malware programs cannot disable or bypass. These units are so 
cheap that you should get one even if you have only one computer. (See 
Chapter 5 for details.)
	
✓	Install virus-protection and spyware-protection software and keep it 
current. Virus protection costs $25 per year or so. Pay it. Chapter 4 tells 
you how to install virus checkers and spyware scanners.
	
	You must keep the virus-description files in your antivirus software 
updated — automatically if possible, and every week at least. (New 
viruses are launched every day.) The maker of your antivirus software 
should have a Web site from which you can download the updates; 
check your documentation.
	
✓	Don’t open an e-mail attachment unless it’s from someone you know 
and you’re expecting it. Contact the sender if you aren’t sure.
	
✓	Don’t click links in e-mail messages unless you’re sure that you know 
where they lead. If you click one and the site you end up at wants your 
password or credit card number or dog’s name, close your browser 
window. Don’t even think about giving out any information.
	
✓	Pick passwords that are hard to guess, and never give them to anyone 
else. Don’t give them to the nice lady who says she’s from the help desk 
or to the bogus FBI special agent who claims to need it for tracking down 
a kidnapped child. No one.
	
✓	Be consistent. If you share your computer with several family members 
or housemates, make sure that every one understands these rules and 
agrees to follow them.

Chapter 3
Kids and the Net
In This Chapter
▶	Recognizing good and not-so-good ways that kids use the Internet
▶	Getting wise to some concerns about the Internet
▶	Working up parental guidelines for using the Internet
▶	Looking at the Internet in schools
F
ace it: Most kids are way more comfortable on the Internet than their 
parents (and grandparents) are. Schools assign kids to do research on 
the Web and e-mail information to other students or their teachers. Online 
games are designed for kids of all ages. Forbidding your kids from using the 
Net altogether is hopeless (unless they’re younger than about 6), but you 
want to keep your kids safe. This chapter talks about what’s great — and 
what’s scary — about children and youth using the Internet.
With millions of kids online, a discussion about family Internet use is critical. 
(Obviously, if this isn’t your concern, just skip this chapter and go to 
another one.)
Really Cool Ways Kids Use the Net
The Net is amazing. It can help kids with the things they have to do (homework)
as well as with what they want to do:
	
✓	Research homework assignments: The Internet is an incredible way to
expand the walls of a school. The Net can connect kids to libraries, 
research resources, museums, other schools, and other people. Kids 
can visit the American Museum of Natural History for information about 
anthropology and other natural sciences (at www.amnh.org, as shown 
in Figure 3-1) and the Sistine Chapel (www.vatican.va — click English 
and then Vatican Museums and then Online Tours); they can watch 
spotted newts in their native habitat; they can hear new music and make 
new friends. These days, many schools assume that kids have access to 
the Web, so parents had better be ready.

36
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
	
Figure 3-1: 
Many 
museums 
have

✓	Make e-friends in other countries: School projects such as the Global 
Schoolhouse connect kids around the world by working collaboratively 
on all types of projects. Its annual cyberfairs have brought together 
more than 500,000 students from hundreds of schools in at least 37 
countries! Kids can find out more at the Global Schoolhouse Web site, 
www.globalschoolnet.org/GSH, where they can also subscribe to 
lots of mailing lists. (We explain in Chapter 6 how to reach these loca­
tions so that you can come back here later and help your kids follow up 
on them.)
	
✓	Practice foreign languages: Kids can visit online chat rooms, where 
they can try out their French or Spanish or Portuguese or Russian or 
Japanese or even Esperanto.
	
✓	Pay for downloaded music: Kids love music, and they can buy music 
over the Internet in several ways. (Adults can too, as it turns out.) The 
Apple iTunes music store, at www.apple.com/itunes, sells songs for 
about 99 cents. Other sites, such as www.napster.com, let you download 
as many songs as you like for a monthly fee. See Chapter 9 for details.
	
✓	Write an encyclopedia article: Wikipedia, at en.wikipedia.org, is 
a free online encyclopedia that anyone can contribute to. It’s a useful 
research tool, but, even better, kids can add the material they found 
while researching those term papers to make Wikipedia even better. A 
worldwide team of volunteer writers and editors updates the material con­
tinually, and you — or your child! — can be one of them. (See Chapter 20 
to find out what wikis are.)
	
✓	Discover how to make Web sites: A Web site can be as clever or as stupid 
as you like. You and your kids can post your stories or artwork for family 
and friends to admire. We explain how to do these things in Part V.

37
 Chapter 3: Kids and the Net
	
Whenever you or your kids search for a topic, you may see pages written by the 
world’s greatest authority on that topic, a crackpot pushing a harebrained 
theory, a college kid’s term paper, a guy on a bulletin board who thinks he’s an 
expert, or, more likely, all of the above. Some Web sites are maintained by hate 
groups and push truly nasty venom. Being able to identify all those types of infor­
mation is one of the most valuable skills that children (or anyone) can acquire.
So-So Ways Kids Use the Net
Here are some ideas that adults might consider a waste of time, but hey, we 
can’t be serious all the time:
	
✓	Play games: Many popular games (both traditional — such as chess, 
bridge, hearts, and go — and video) have options that let kids compete 
against other players on the Internet. See Chapter 17, if you dare, but 
you may find yourself turning into a gamer!
	
✓	Send IMs to friends: Instant messaging (IM) is a cool way to get in touch — 
instantly. Wireless options are already happening in many parts of the 
world. We reveal all in Chapter 16.
	
✓	Talk on a videophone: Thanks to software such as Yahoo! Messenger 
and Skype, kids can see their friends while talking to them (not recom­
mended on bad hair days). Chapter 16 talks about free video programs.
	
✓	Create an online profile on a social networking site. Web sites such as 
Facebook and MySpace enable people to create a page about themselves 
and then link to their friends. We have privacy and safety concerns 
about kids using these sites. See Chapter 18.
	
✓	Shop: What can we say? Internet shopping is like shopping at the mall, 
except that the Internet is always open and you don’t have to hunt for a 
parking place. Kids can sell stuff too. Chapter 10 gets you started.
	
✓	Role-play: Any number of Internet sites let players pretend to be 
characters in their favorite science fiction or fantasy books. Chapter 17 
describes virtual worlds on the Web.
Not-So-Good Ways Kids Use the Net
Make sure that your kids or grandkids stay away from these ideas, which will 
just get them into trouble — some of it serious:
	
✓	Plagiarism: That’s the fancy word for passing off other people’s work as 
your own. Plagiarizing from the Internet is just as wrong as plagiarizing 
from a book — and (for that matter) a lot easier for teachers to catch 
because teachers can use search engines, too.

38
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
	
✓	Cheating: Using translating software to do language homework is also 
no good. Besides, automated translations are still no substitute for the 
real thing.
	
✓	Revealing too much personal information: When chatting on the Net 
with people your kids don’t know, they might be tempted to give out iden­
tifying information about themselves or your family, but it’s dangerous — 
doing so can get them stalked, ripped off, or worse. Even revealing their 
e-mail addresses can invite unwanted junk mail. Some seemingly innocent 
questions that strangers ask online aren’t so innocent, so we go into more 
detail later in this chapter about what to watch for.
	
✓	Sharing copyrighted music and videos: Now that kids can easily buy 
music online, they don’t have much excuse for using file-sharing soft­
ware to trade music or videos without permission. The music and movie 
industries are getting better at finding people who do that — and are 
taking legal action against them. It could cost you a lot of money.
	
✓	Visiting porn and hate sites: This advice is between you and your kids. 
Parents should make clear rules about what types of Web sites are 
acceptable, post them near the computer, and stick to them.
	
✓	Pretending to be someone else online: Kids should make up pseud­
onyms so that they don’t have to use their real names. (This strategy 
can be one way to limit how much any stranger finds out.) But, pretend­
ing that you’re a talent agent for American Idol or the latest reality show 
looking for a date is a bad idea.
	
✓	Hanging out in adult chat rooms: If kids pretend to be older than they 
are, they can get themselves and the chat room hosts into trouble.
	
✓	Letting the Internet take over your life: If the only thing your kids want 
to do after school is get online, it’s time to set some limits. (Ditto for 
parents and their work!)
Truly Brain-Dead Things 
Kids Should Never Do
	
Here are some ideas that kids should never consider because they can lead 
directly into major trouble:
	
✓	Meet online friends in person without telling a parent: If a child or 
youth meets someone online and wants to meet that person face-to-face, 
fine — maybe. But parents need to take precautions! First, make sure that 
your kid tells you about the meeting so that you can decide together how 
to proceed. Second, no one (child, youth, or adult) should ever meet an 
online friend in a private place: Always arrange to meet in a public place, 

39
 Chapter 3: Kids and the Net
such as a restaurant. Finally, go to the meeting with your child, in case 
they have been completely misled. (You can lurk discretely nearby, so 
bring a book.)
	
✓	Do anything illegal — online or off: The Internet feels totally anonymous, 
but it’s not. If kids or adults commit a crime, the police can get the Internet 
connection records from your Internet service provider (ISP) and find out 
who was connected over which modem on which day and at what time with 
which numeric Internet (IP) address, and they’ll find you.
	
✓	Break into other computers or create viruses: This little escapade 
might have been considered a prank back in the 1980s, but the authori­
ties have long since lost their sense of humor about it. Kids have gone to 
jail for it.
The Internet and Little Kids
We are strong advocates of allowing kids to be kids, and we believe that 
humans are better teachers than computers are. Now that you know our pre­
disposition, maybe you can guess what we’re going to say next: We are not in 
favor of sticking a young child in front of a screen. How young is too young? 
We believe that younger than age 5 is too young. At young ages, kids benefit 
more from playing with trees, balls, clay, crayons, paint, mud, monkey bars, 
bicycles, other kids, and especially older siblings. Computers make lousy 
babysitters. If your young children use computers, choose their programs 
and Web sites carefully, and limit their screen time.
We think that Internet access is more appropriate for somewhat older kids 
(fourth or fifth grade and older), but your mileage may vary. Even so, we 
think it’s a good idea to limit the amount of time that anyone, especially kids, 
spends online. We (despite our good looks) have been playing with comput­
ers for 35 years (each), and we know what happens to kids who are allowed 
to stay glued to their computers for unlimited lengths of time — trust us, it 
is not good. Do you remember those old sayings “You are what you eat” and 
“Garbage in, garbage out”? What your brain devours makes a difference.
As human beings (what a concept), kids need to be able to communicate with 
other human beings. Too often, kids who have difficulty doing that prefer to 
get absorbed in computers — which doesn’t help develop their social skills. 
Existing problems in that department grow worse, leading to more isolation. 
If you’re starting to feel like your child is out of touch and you want to put 
the machine in its place (and maybe even encourage your child to get her life 
back), here are some quick self-defense tips:
	
✓	Keep a private log of all the time your child spends in front of the screen 
during one week. Then ask your child whether this is really how she 
wants to spend her life.

40
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
	
✓	Help your child find a hobby that doesn’t involve a screen. Encourage 
him to join a team, form a band, or create some kind of art.
	
✓	Have your child set aside one computer-free day each week.
	
✓	Make your child have meals and conversations with actual human 
beings (that would be you and the rest of your family), face to face, 
in real time.
Surf Safe
Make sure your kids or grandkids know the safety rules for using the Net. 
Here are some basic guidelines for your kids to start with:
	
✓	Never reveal exactly who you are. Your child should use only his first 
name, and shouldn’t provide a last name, an address, a phone number, 
or the name of his school.
	
✓	Never, ever, tell anyone your password. No honest person will ever ask 
you or your kid for it.
	
✓	Be suspicious of strangers who seem to know a lot about you. Maybe 
they say they’re a friend of yours (the parent) who is supposed to pick 
up your kid after school or pick up a package from your house. Make 
sure your kid knows to never go with a stranger or let one into the house 
without asking a trusted (offline) adult first.
Here are a few more guidelines to help kids sidestep online trouble:
	
✓	Think before you give your e-mail address to anybody. Many Web 
sites ask users to register, and many require users to provide a work­
ing e-mail address that they verify by sending a confirmation message. 
Before you let your child register with a Web site, make sure that it’s run 
by a reputable company from which you won’t mind getting junk mail.
	
✓	Never agree to talk to someone on the phone or meet someone in 
person without checking it out with a parent first. Most people a kid 
can meet online are okay, but a few creepy types out there have made 
the Internet their hunting ground.
	
✓	Don’t assume that people are telling you the truth. That “kid” who says 
he’s your kid’s age and gender and seems to share your child’s interests 
and hobbies may in reality be a lonely 40-year-old. If your kids have younger 
siblings, impress upon them how important it is to watch out for the safety 
of their younger “sibs.” They may not understand what a stranger is and 
believe that everything people tell them online is always true.

41
 Chapter 3: Kids and the Net
	
✓	If someone is scaring you or making you uncomfortable — especially 
if the person says not to tell your parents — tell your parents. If some­
one bothers your child, make sure she knows to ask you to talk to your 
Internet service provider. Remind your kid that she can always turn off 
the computer.
Sell, Sell, Sell!
If you spend a lot of time online, you will soon notice that everyone seems 
to be trying to sell you something. Kids, particularly those from middle- and 
upper-income families, are a lucrative target market, and the Net is being 
viewed as another way to capture this market.
Targeting kids for selling isn’t new. Remember Joe Camel of the Camel ciga­
rette campaign that many people claimed was aimed at kids? Some schools 
make students watch Channel One, a system that brings advertising directly 
to the classroom. If you watch TV, you know how TV programs for kids push 
their own lines of toys and action figures.
Kids should know that big company marketing departments have designed 
kid-friendly, fascinating, captivating software to help them better market to 
you. Delightful, familiar cartoon characters deftly elicit strategic marketing 
information directly from the keyboard in your home.
You should be aware of this situation and know what to do when someone 
on the Web is asking your kids for information. If your kids have access to 
credit cards, yours or their own, they can spend big bucks over the Internet. 
Beware of online stores where you have configured your Web browser to 
remember your passwords, because your kids will be able to waltz right in 
and start buying. And, your kids should be aware that if they spend your 
money online without permission, they’re going to get into big trouble for it.
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) limits the information 
that companies can collect from children under 13 (or at least, children who 
admit they’re under 13) without explicit parental consent — which, by the 
way, we think parents should rarely give. We heard of one marketer who said 
he wanted to use the Net to create a personal relationship with all the kids 
who use his product. Ugh. We have names for guys who want relationships 
with kids, and they’re not nice names.
The FTC (www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec10.shtm) 
has more useful information for teachers about COPPA and online privacy 
that’s useful for parents, too.

42
Part I: Welcome to the Internet 
Who’s Online?
Lots of kids — and grown-ups — are putting up Web sites about themselves 
and their families. Social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace 
(see Chapter 18) make it easy. We think that creating Web sites is cool, but 
we strongly encourage families who use the Net for personal reasons (distinct 
from businesspeople who use the Net for business purposes) not to use their 
full or real names. We also advise you and your children never to disclose 
your address, phone number, Social Security number, or account passwords 
in online social situations to anyone who asks for this kind of information — 
online or off. This advice applies especially when people who claim to be 
in positions of authority ask for them— for example, instant messages from 
people claiming that they’re from America Online (AOL) tech support. 
They’re not, as we detail in Chapter 2.
	
People with real authority never ask those types of questions. (For one thing, 
Internet service providers don’t handle member accounts by using instant 
messages, and they never ask for credit card information by e-mail. It all makes 
a great case for knowing how your Internet service provider does work.)
More than ever, children need to develop critical-thinking skills. They have to 
be able to evaluate what they read and see — especially on the Web.
Regrettably, almost anyone with an e-mail address receives their share of 
junk e-mail (spam). This situation will only get worse until we have effective 
laws — as well as technology — against unwanted e-mail. In the meantime, 
remember this important rule: If an e-mail offer sounds too good to be true, 
it isn’t true — and if an ad shows up from someone you don’t know, that’s 
also good evidence that it isn’t true. See Chapter 14 for weapons on the war 
against spam.
The Internet in Schools
Some schools and libraries use software to filter Internet access for kids. A 
variety of filtering systems are available, at a range of costs and installation 
hassles, that promise to filter out inappropriate and harmful Web sites. It 
sounds good, but many kids are smart enough to find ways around rules, and 
extremely smart kids can find ways around software systems designed to 
“protect” them.
We believe that Internet filtering in schools isn’t a good approach. Kids are 
quicker and more highly motivated and have more time to spend breaking into 
and out of systems than most adults we know, and this method doesn’t encour­
age them to do something more productive than electronic lock-picking.

43
 Chapter 3: Kids and the Net
Many institutions rely successfully on students’ signed contracts that detail 
explicitly what is appropriate and what is inappropriate to use. Students 
who violate these contracts lose their Internet or computer privileges. We 
recommend the approach of contracts and consequences, from which kids 
can truly learn.
	
We don’t think much of filtering software on home computers, for the same 
reason, but if you want to use it anyway, look at Windows Live Family Safety, 
part of the free Microsoft Windows Live software suite. (See Chapter 13 for 
download instructions.) It blocks Web sites that the parent specifies or that 
are in its built-in list, but it doesn’t try to be sneaky. When it blocks, it says so 
and lets the kid send a note to the parent to ask to unblock the site. The ser­
vice is free, so when you decide that you don’t want it and turn it off, you 
haven’t wasted any money.
Many schools use the Internet to post information that students can use in 
their classes, including a summary of the curriculum, upcoming assignments, 
and links to Web sites with useful resources. One such system is Moodle (at 
www.moodle.org) — ask your kids whether their teachers post assignments 
and resources online.
A few schools, such as the University of Phoenix (www.phoenix.edu), spe­
cialize in online education, but schools all over the world now offer online 
instruction, and some (such as MIT, at web.mit.edu) make all their course 
material available online for free. If the course is on the Net, it doesn’t matter 
whether the school is across the street or across the ocean. You can find 
thousands of schools and courses in directories such as these:
www.petersons.com/distancelearning
www.online-colleges-courses-degrees-classes.org
Checking out colleges on the Net
Most colleges and universities have sites on 
the Web. You can find a directory of online 
campus tours at www.campustours.com, 
with links to lots more info about colleges and 
universities.
After you’re a little more adept at using the Net, 
you can use it to take a closer look at classes 
and professors to gain a better idea of what 
colleges have to offer.

A Few Useful Web Sites
Here are a few sites that may be useful for kids and parents (and grandparents).
These sites focus on education and parenting:
	
✓	The Global Schoolhouse, at www.globalschoolnet.org/GSH: An 
online meeting place for teachers, students, and parents
	
✓	Great Web Sites for Kids, from the American Library Association, at 
www.ala.org/ala/alsc (and then click Great Web Sites for Kids)
	
✓	KidPub, at www.kidpub.com: Book reviews by kids
	
✓	FunBrain, at www.funbrain.com: Educational games for kindergarten 
through eighth grade
These sites are just plain fun:
	
✓	Yahoo! Kids, at kids.yahoo.com: This Yahoo! Web portal is designed 
for kids.
	
✓	Kids World, at northvalley.net/kids: Find links to fun and interest­
ing sites.
	
✓	The Yuckiest Site on the Internet, at yucky.discovery.com: It’s just 
what it sounds like — the yuckier, the better!
	
✓	The CIA Homepage for Kids, at https://www.cia.gov/kids-page: 
You have to type the https:// part (it’s a secure site — that’s what the 
s means) because it’s, you know, the CIA.
	
✓	Net-Mom at www.netmom.com: The site is run by our friend Jean Polly, who 
has been looking for online resources for kids even longer than we have.
	
✓	Sports Illustrated for Kids, at www.sikids.com: This one highlights 
sports news and games.
Not just for kids: School on the Net
Your child’s education, as well as your own, isn’t 
over when you finish high school or college or 
(for those of us seriously dedicated to avoiding 
real life) graduate school. There’s always more 
to learn. Nothing’s quite like learning directly 
from a first-rate teacher in a classroom, but 
learning over the Net can be the next-best thing 
to being there — particularly for students who 
live far from school or have irregular sched­
ules. You can now take everything online from 
high school equivalency exams to professional 
continuing education to college and graduate 
courses leading to degrees. Some courses 
are strictly online; others use a combination of 
classroom, lab, and online instruction.

A
fter you’re ready to get started, where do you start? 
Probably the hardest part of using the Internet is 
getting connected. We help you figure out which kind of 
Internet service is right for you and help you get con­
nected, with plenty of advice for broadband (fast), Wi-Fi 
(wireless), and mobile (smartphone) users.

Chapter 4
Assembling Your Gear and 
Climbing on the Net
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing a computer, or another device, for Internet access
▶ Hooking up to DSL and cable accounts
▶ Dialing in to slow, old-fashioned Internet accounts
▶ Staying safe with firewalls, virus checkers, and spyware checkers
▶ Our favorite Internet setup: broadband with a router (a what?)
▶ Using an Internet-enabled phone
▶ What you can do after you’re connected
“G
reat,” you say, “How do I connect my computer to the Internet?” 
The answer is “It depends.” (You’ll hear that answer perhaps more 
often than you’d like.) The Internet isn’t one network — it’s 100,000 separate 
networks hooked together, each with its own rules and procedures, and you 
can get to the Net from any one of them. Readers of previous editions of this 
book pleaded (they said other things too, but this is a family-oriented book) for 
step-by-step directions on how to get on, so we made this chapter as “steptual” 
as possible.
Here (drumroll, please) are those basic steps:
 
1. Figure out which type of computer you have or can use.
 
2. Figure out which types of Internet connections are available where 
you are.
 
3. Sign up for your connection.
 
4. Set up your computer to use your new connection, and decide 
whether you like it.
 
5. Install the software you need to protect your computer from viruses 
and spyware.
 
 See Chapter 2 for scary descriptions of the types of Internet dangers you 
need to protect yourself from.

48
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
You need four items to connect to the Internet:
	
✓	A computer, even a tiny computer, like a Palm or a phone or another 
handheld device
	
✓	A modem (a piece of computer equipment, which may be right inside 
the computer) to hook your computer to the phone line, cable system, 
or mobile phone system
	
✓	An account with an Internet service provider (ISP), to give your modem 
somewhere to connect to
	
✓	Software to run on your computer
We look at each of these items in turn.
	
If you have more than one computer to connect to the Internet, see Chapter 5. If 
your computer is a laptop, see the section in Chapter 5 about using your 
laptop or netbook at home and away.
	
Internet accounts are easy to use, but they can be tricky to set up. In fact, con­
necting for the first time can be the most difficult part of your Internet experi­
ence. Installing and setting up Internet connection software used to require 
that you type lots of scary-looking numerical Internet addresses, hostnames, 
communications-port numbers — you name it. These days, making the con­
nection is much easier, partly because Internet software can now figure out 
most of the details itself, but mostly because all recent versions of Windows 
and Macs include setup software that can step you through the process.
What Kind of Computer Do You Need?
Because the Internet is a computer network, the only way to hook up to it is 
by using some kind of computer. But computers are starting to appear in all 
sorts of disguises — including in phones, MP3 music players, and toasters 
(okay, not really) — and they may well already be in your home, whether you 
know it or not.
Hey, I don’t even have a computer!
If you don’t have a computer and aren’t ready or able to buy one, you still 
have some options.
A likely place to find Internet access is in your public library. Most libraries 
have added Internet access centers, with clusters of Internet-connected com­
puters among the bookshelves. These computers tend to be popular, so call 
ahead to reserve time or find out which hours are less crowded.

49
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
Another option is your local cybercafé. You can surf the Net while sipping 
your favorite beverage and sharing your cyberexperience. If you want to 
check out the Internet, a cybercafé is a great place to try before you buy. 
Some have computers ready for you to use, whereas others require you to 
bring your own laptop (see the section about using your laptop or netbook at 
home and away, in Chapter 5, for laptop safety tips).
If you want to use the Internet from your very own home, you’re stuck getting 
some kind of computer. Luckily, almost any newish computer can connect to 
the Internet, and you can get perfectly usable ones for less than $300.
Yup, I have this old, beige 
box in the closet
Almost any personal computer made since 1980 is adequate for some type of 
connection to the Internet. But unless you have a really good friend who is 
a computer geek and wants to spend a lot of time at your house helping you 
get online, it isn’t worth fooling with that old clunker — unless, of course, 
you’re looking for a reason for the geek to spend a lot of time at your house, 
but that’s your business.
If you can afford it, we strongly encourage you to buy a new computer or 
at least one that isn’t more than two years old. New computers come with 
Internet software already installed and are configured for the latest in Web 
technology. If you already own an older computer, you will spend more time 
and energy, and ultimately just as much money, just trying to get the thing to 
work the way you want. We think that it’s best to buy a brand-new computer.
One problem with old computers is that they tend to run old versions of 
software. Any version of Windows older than Windows XP or any Mac system 
older than OSX is more hassle than it’s worth to try to use.
Yup, I got a brand-new BitBucket 2010
Ah, you do have a computer. (Or maybe you’re thinking about buying one.) 
Most Internet users connect by way of a broadband connection, or in a 
few areas where broadband isn’t available, by the computer dialing over 
the phone line to an Internet service provider. When you first turn on your 
new computer, or when you run one of the Internet programs that comes 
installed, your computer offers to attempt to connect right then and there. 
First read the rest of this chapter. We have some warnings and some options 
we think you ought to consider first.

50
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
Yup, I’m getting a netbook
A new category of computer is on the scene, if you haven’t noticed: the netbook. 
It’s smaller and lighter than a laptop but bigger than a cellphone or handheld 
personal organizer. The netbook has a full keyboard, even if its keys are a little 
smaller than normal, and it’s cheaper than most laptops — maybe the same 
price as an expensive phone (in the $200-$400 range). And, it has built-in Wi-Fi.
The first netbook was the ASUS Eee PC (sounds like a screech), and now 
laptop, phone, and other types of manufacturers have gotten into the game. 
For information on using a netbook, see Chapter 5.
Yup, I got this little BlackBerry, 
iPhone, or Palm
Modern mobile phones have itty-bitty screens and itty-bitty keypads, so 
industry groups devised a way to show itty-bitty Web pages on those screens 
and navigate around them. Smartphones (phones with Internet capabilities) 
are quite popular in Japan (where teenage girls use it to write novels one 
screen at a time), and have finally caught on in the United States. Unlike 
on your PC, a smartphone doesn’t require special setup beyond what your 
phone company does when it sells you the phone.
	
However, you pay a lot extra for a smartphone. The phone itself costs several 
hundred dollars, and you also pay extra for Internet usage. On some plans, 
you can pay based on the amount of data you transfer, which can be several 
dollars per download. If you plan to do much browsing from your phone, call 
your phone company and sign up for a monthly data plan, which costs about 
$30 per month. With some smartphones (including the iPhone), you’re forced 
to buy a monthly data plan.
Before getting a smartphone, consider whether you have a specific use in 
mind and be sure to try someone else’s to see whether you can stand using 
its teeny screen. The Palm, the BlackBerry, and many other handheld models 
are designed to display text messages, e-mail, and simple Web pages on their 
small screens. Go to a cellphone store and ask to see a demonstration. If you 
get a smartphone and you want some tips, see the section in Chapter 5 about 
using your smartphone on the Net.
	
You don’t need the Internet to send and receive text messages. You can 
even get information from some Web servers by sending a text message. For 
instructions, see the section in Chapter 8 about searching from your cellphone.

51
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
The Types of Internet Connections
If you use a computer at a library, at work, at a cybercafé, or at someone 
else’s house, you don’t need to worry about how it connects to the Internet 
because someone else has already done the work. But if you have your own 
computer, you have several options:
	
✓	Connect by using a fast phone line (DSL line).
	
✓	Connect by using your cable TV company.
	
✓	Connect by using AOL (America Online); AOL isn’t the Internet, but it 
connects to the Internet.
	
✓	Dial in by using a regular phone line.
What’s in an Account?
An Internet account — fast or slow — comes with
	
✓	That all-important username and password: You have to be able to 
connect, after all.
	
✓	One or more e-mail addresses, each with its own mailbox: Most 
accounts have from one to five e-mail addresses. If you have a family, 
each family member can have a separate address.
	
✓	Webmail (a Web site where you can read your mail): Webmail is 
useful when you want to check your mail and you’re not at your own 
computer with your own e-mail program. You can use a Web browser 
to display your messages from any computer. See Chapter 13.
It should also come with a toll-free number that you can call for support. 
Every ISP has a Web site showing prices, sign-up instructions, and support 
information.
Speedy Connections: DSL 
and Cable Internet
The most popular way to connect, available almost but not quite everywhere, 
is a broadband (high-speed) connection. Broadband connections can provide 
greater bandwidth — that is, more data transferred in a specific amount of 
time — than older dialup phone connections. This type of connection can be 
extremely fast, several million bits per second, with downloads (in practice) 
often exceeding 300,000 bytes per second.

52
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
Broadband connections are now available and affordable by mere mortals in 
all but the most rural locations in the United States and Canada. (Even rural 
locations can connect using the same satellite that provides satellite TV.)
	
After you get used to having a broadband connection, you’ll never be able to 
tolerate an old-fashioned dialup connection again. It’s that good.
What is broadband, anyway?
There are two types of broadband Internet connections — DSL and cable:
	
✓	A Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a special phone line that you or your 
ISP orders from your local telephone company, usually shared with the 
same line that connects your regular phones.
	
✓	A cable Internet account is provided by your local cable TV company, 
using the same cable connection that brings you 250 brain-numbing TV 
channels.
DSL and cable Internet accounts have a lot in common: They’re fast and they 
don’t tie up your regular phone line. Some broadband accounts have a per­
manent connection that works a lot like a connection to a local network in an 
office. Others require you to log on each time you want to use the Internet. 
The ISP provides most of the equipment — for example, the modem — and 
often sends an installer to set it up with your computer. Ask your cable 
A word about usernames and passwords
Over a billion people are on the Internet. 
Because only one of them is you, it would 
be nice if the rest of them can’t go snooping 
through your files and e-mail messages. For 
that reason — no matter which type of Internet 
account you have — your account has a user­
name and a secret password associated with it.
Your username (or user ID, login name, logon 
name, or screen name) is unique among all the 
names assigned to your provider’s users. It’s 
usually also your e-mail address, so don’t pick 
a name like snickerdoodle unless that’s what 
you want to tell your friends and put on your 
business cards.
Your password is secret and is the main thing 
that keeps bad guys from borrowing an account. 
Don’t use a real word or a name. See “What’s 
the secret word, Mr. Potter?” in Chapter 2 for 
ideas for passwords that you have some hope 
of remembering.
Never tell anyone else your password. 
Particularly don’t tell people who claim to be 
from your ISP or your bank— they’re not.

53
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
company whether it offers Internet access and ask your phone company 
whether it offers DSL. If yes is the answer to either question, get one or the 
other.
High-speed cable and DSL cost about $30 per month depending on your loca­
tion, plus installation and the cost of the special modem you need, minus 
whatever discount you receive for buying a package of broadband and other 
types of services the provider supplies. You usually get the best price with 
a package combining Internet with some or all of its phone, cable TV, and 
mobile phone services.
	
A hidden cost in getting either cable or DSL Internet access is having to take 
a day off from work to wait for the installers, unless you feel brave enough 
to install it yourself. Sometimes it takes the installers two trips to get things 
working. Try to make the first appointment in the morning. Also, the cable 
company or phone company is usually also your ISP unless you pay extra, so 
you don’t have a choice of ISPs. In theory, the phone company provides DSL 
access on equal terms to all ISPs — but, in practice, its own ISP somehow 
always seems to be more equal than the others.
Cable and DSL modems
To connect to a DSL or cable account, you use a DSL or a cable modem. The 
phone or cable company provides it (sometimes for a fee). Don’t buy one 
yourself — you need a modem that’s compatible with your provider’s equip­
ment, so smart Internauts get their DSL or cable modems from the ISP that 
provides their Internet service and then let someone there install it.
How your computer connects 
to the modem
DSL and cable modems connect to your computer in one of two-and-a-half ways:
	
✓	Network adapter: A network adapter (or LAN adapter or Ethernet adapter 
or network interface card) was originally designed for connecting 
computers into networks. If you have more than one computer in your 
home or office, you can use network adapters to connect the computers 
into a local-area network (LAN), as described in Chapter 5. A network 
adapter has an RJ-45 jack, which looks like a regular phone jack but is a 
little bigger, into which you plug your modem or network cable. Check the 
back and sides of your computer for holes that look like overgrown phone 
jacks. All modern PCs (and all Macs) have network adapters built in.

54
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
	
✓	Wireless network adapter: If your computer isn’t located close to a 
phone or cable outlet or you have a laptop you carry around the house, 
you can use a wireless network, often called Wi-Fi. It works pretty much 
the same as a wired network, only without the wires (duh!). All laptops 
built in the past five years have built-in Wi-Fi. We cover the ins and outs 
of Wi-Fi in Chapter 5.
	
✓	USB: Almost all computers come with one or more USB (Universal Serial 
Bus, if you care) connectors, which are used for connecting all kinds of 
stuff to your computer, from mice to cameras to printers. A USB port 
looks like a small, narrow, rectangular hole.
Here’s some information of interest only to people with very old comput­
ers: If your cable or DSL modem installer reports that your computer doesn’t 
have the network adapter or USB port that’s needed to connect your modem, 
don’t panic. If the installer can’t provide the needed adapter, contact a local 
computer store about adding a network card — it shouldn’t cost more than 
$20. Desktop computers need PCI or PCI Express network adapters, which are 
printed circuit boards that you install by turning off the computer, opening the 
case, finding an empty slot, sliding the card in, screwing down the card, and 
closing up the computer. Laptops use various sorts of PC Card network adapt­
ers, which look like fat credit cards and just slide into a slot on the side of the 
laptop. Several different kinds of PCI and PC Card slots are available; if you buy 
a card, be sure that it fits the kind of slot your computer has.
Getting your DSL hooked up
DSL service is supposed to use your existing phone line and in-house wiring. 
But DSL often works better if the phone company runs a new wire from 
outside your building to where you use your computer. (Phone companies 
call this a home run.) For most kinds of DSL to work, you have to live within 
a couple of miles of your telephone central office, so DSL is unavailable in 
many rural areas.
DSL is available at different speeds. The higher speeds cost more (surprise, 
surprise!). The lowest speed, usually 640 Kbps, is adequate for most users.
If DSL service is available in your area, call either your phone company or an ISP 
to arrange for DSL service. Either it ships you the equipment to install yourself or 
a phone installer comes with a network connection box (a glorified modem) that 
you or the installer hook up to your computer. Some DSL modems connect to a 
network adapter or USB connector, some include a router (described in more 
detail later) which can also provide a Wi-Fi connection.

55
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
Getting your cable Internet hooked up
To sign up for a cable account, call your local cable company to open one. 
Unless you decide to install it yourself (which isn’t all that hard), a technician 
comes and installs a network-connection doozus (technical term) where your 
TV cable comes into your house, installs a network adapter in your computer 
if it doesn’t already have one (unlikely, these days), brings a cable modem 
(which can look like a junior laptop computer with a spike hairdo), and hooks 
them together. Magic.
If you have cable television, the cable is split, and one segment goes to your 
computer. If you don’t have cable television, the cable company may have to 
install the actual cable before it can wire up your computer. When the techni­
cian goes away, however, you have a permanent, high-speed connection to 
the Internet (as long as you pay your bill, about $40 to $50 a month).
Do-it-yourself DSL
Hooking up your DSL modem shouldn’t be tough. One side plugs into the 
phone line, the other side into your computer. How hard can that be? Well, 
a few little details are involved.
Avoiding the DSL buzz
One clever thing about DSL is that the DSL 
connection shares the same phone wires with 
your phone without tying up the phone line. You 
can tell that this is the case because on all the 
phones on the line with DSL, you may hear a 
loud buzz of Data Hornets swarming up and 
down your phone line. (Well, not really, but it 
can sound like it.)
To get rid of the buzz, you may need to install a 
DSL filter, which filters out the buzz, between 
the phone line and all your phones. Filters are 
available from your DSL ISP, but you can proba­
bly find them cheaper at stores like RadioShack. 
The ideal way to install a filter is to run a sepa­
rate wire from the box where the phone line 
enters your house to the DSL modem, and to 
install one DSL filter in that box into which you 
plug the wire leading to all the phones. But life 
is rarely ideal, so most of us install a filter for 
each phone.
For the phone plug where your DSL modem is 
connected, you want a splitter filter with a fil­
tered jack into which you plug a phone (the one 
you use to call tech support when your com­
puter doesn’t work) and an unfiltered or some­
times data-filtered jack for the DSL modem. For 
all other phones, the filter just plugs into the 
phone jack, and the phone cord plugs into the 
filter. For that tidy look, you can also get wall-
phone filters (which fit between the phone and 
the wall plate that the phone is mounted on) and 
baseboard phone jacks with filters built in.

Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
We assume that you have a DSL modem that connects to a network or USB 
connector. If you have a network connector, you need a crossover network 
cable that should have come with the DSL modem. (Regular, noncrossover 
cables plug into a router or network hub, not directly from a modem to 
a computer.) If you’re using USB, you should have a USB cable with a flat 
connector on one end and a squarish connector on the other. Turn off and 
unplug both your computer and the modem from the wall socket, plug in 
the network or USB cable, and then plug everything back in. The modem 
also connects to the phone line with a regular phone cord. The phone and 
network jacks on the modem are similar, but the network connector is the 
bigger one. Your computer setup should look something like the one shown 
in Figure 4-1. The details may vary a little @md John’s DSL came with filters 
that include the two-for-one adapter, and the modem includes a Wi-Fi router, 
so there’s no cable to the computer.
Now you can skip ahead to the section “After the DSL or cable Internet 
installer.” And be sure to read the nearby sidebar, “Avoiding the DSL buzz.”

Do-it-yourself cable modems
Connecting a cable modem is not unlike connecting a DSL modem, except 
that you connect it to your TV cable rather than to your phone line. If a TV 
is already attached to the cable, unscrew the cable from the TV and throw 
away the TV because you’ll be having much too much fun with your Internet 
connection to waste time watching TV. (If you’re not yet ready to throw away 
your TV, move it to another cable outlet or get a cable splitter, available at 
any store that sells cable accessories.) Screw the cable into the cable modem 
and plug the network or USB cable from the modem to the computer, just as 
we describe for a DSL modem in the previous section.

57
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
After the DSL or cable Internet installer
The installer (which is you, if you installed the modem yourself) configures 
your computer to communicate with the Internet. Follow the instructions to 
connect to your account the first time; some DSL and cable modems come 
with a software CD you may need to use.
Chances are good, at this point, that you’re on the Internet. You should be 
able to start up a Web browser, like Internet Explorer, and type the name of 
a Web site in the address box at the top (try our net.gurus.org). The Web 
page should appear momentarily. If you have a connection with a username, 
it may ask you whether to connect. (Well, yeah, that’s the idea, but sarcasm 
is lost on machinery.)
If you still can’t connect, you can try configuring Windows yourself.
Fast, fibrous FiOS
Cable and DSL network speeds are limited by 
the old-fashioned copper wire they use. Fiber 
optics are much faster, and large telephone 
companies have been making and breaking 
promises to wire us up with fiber for about 20 
years. According to Teletruth, a phone consum­
ers’ advocate, if Verizon had kept the promises 
that its predecessor Bell of Pennsylvania made 
in 1994, most Pennsylvania homes would be 
wired with 45-megabit fiber by now.
Verizon is finally sort of making good on its 
promises with FiOS, a fiber optic package that 
combines fairly fast Internet (not 45 megabits, 
though) with home Wi-Fi, phone, and TV. If you 
want fast Internet and high-definition TV and 
you’re willing to sign up for at least a full year, 
it’s not a bad deal, and costs $45 a month and 
more. But you might want to consider a few 
issues before signing up:
	✓	Verizon has some odd rules about the con­
nections it supports; in particular, it doesn’t 
support wireless connections to Macs, only 
wired.
	✓	There’s no going back. The person who 
hooks up the fiber often physically rips out 
your old copper phone line so that you can’t 
switch back without paying for a full new 
installation.
	✓	It depends on your house power. Regular 
phone service powers your phone from 
the central office, so the phone company’s 
large batteries and professionally main­
tained backup generators keep the phones 
working if the power fails. FiOS uses your 
house power to run your phones as well 
as your Internet and TV connections. It 
provides a battery that’s supposed to keep 
your phone going for four hours if the power 
fails, but the battery lasts only two or three 
years, and if you don’t remember to replace 
it (Verizon won’t), you’ll have an unpleasant 
surprise when the power fails.

Configuring Windows 7 to connect
Windows 7 detects an Internet connection if one exists, so you may not have 
to do a thing. It spots Wi-Fi or a connected DSL or cable modem and does 
the right thing. However, if you need to do it yourself, choose Start➪Control 
Panel➪Network and Internet➪Network and Sharing Center➪Set Up a New 
Connection or Network.
Configuring Windows Vista to connect
Windows Vista makes it slightly easier. If your network connects with a wired 
LAN connection and doesn’t require a login or password (this includes most 
cable modems), Vista normally configures itself automagically, so you don’t have 
to do any of this. For connections that do require a login, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Start➪Connect To, and then click the little Set Up a 
Connection or Network link.
	
	 They still don’t make it easy to find.
	
2.	For the Network Connection Type, choose Connect to the Internet and 
click Next.
	
3.	Select Broadband (PPPoE).
	
	 We cover some of the other options for dialup and wireless later in this 
chapter and in Chapter 5.
	
4.	 Enter the required information in the boxes.
	
	 In particular, enter the login name and password that your ISP gave you.
Configuring Windows XP to connect
To set up your connection using the Windows XP wizard, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Communications➪New 
Connection Wizard.
	
	 They sure don’t make it easy to find.
	
2.	For the network connection type, choose Connect to the Internet and 
click Next.
	
3.	Select Set Up My Connection Manually.
	
	 Choose either Connect Using a Broadband Connection That Requires 
a User Name and Password (if your ISP gave you a username and pass­
word) or Connect Using a Broadband Connection That Is Always On.
	
	 If you’re worried about your computer being connected to the Internet 
all the time, you can shut down your computer — when it’s turned off, 
it’s definitely hackproof! See the section “Essential Software to Keep 
Your System Safe,” later in this chapter.
	
4.	 Enter the required information in the boxes and accept the suggested 
check boxes, particularly the Internet firewall.

 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
	
Your PC communicates with the Internet by using the TCP/IP protocol, and 
you should see it listed in the Properties dialog box for the connection (in 
Windows XP). Don’t fool with these settings unless you’re sure that you know 
what you’re doing!
Checking your DSL or cable connection
After you’re connected, you can check the status of your connection:
	
✓	Windows 7: Display the Network and Sharing Center by choosing Start➪
Control Panel➪Network and Internet➪Network and Sharing Center. Look 
in the View Your Active Networks section, shown in Figure 4-2.
	
✓	Windows Vista: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Sharing 
Center. Broadband connections appear in the upper part of the window.
	
✓	Windows XP: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network And Internet 
Connections➪Network Connections. Broadband connections appear in 
the LAN or High-Speed Internet section.
	
✓	Macs: Use the TCP/IP Control Panel in OS 8 and OS 9. For OS X, choose 
System Preferences from the Apple menu and click the Network icon. 
Then select the TCP/IP tab.

Dialing — the Old-Fashioned Way
A dialup modem connects to a normal, everyday phone line — using the same 
little plug (an RJ-11 jack) and phone wire. You can unplug a phone and plug in 
a dialup modem in its place. The problems with dialup are that the connection 
is s-l-o-w and that your phone line is tied up while you’re online.

60
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
Computers used to come with built-in dialup modems — examine your com­
puter carefully for a phone jack and if you find one, plug a phone wire into it. 
Otherwise, you have to take your computer to the store and have someone 
install one. Don’t confuse the phone jack with a wired Ethernet jack, which 
looks quite similar but is wider.
To use a dialup Internet connection, you sign up with an ISP for an Internet 
account. The features and services that one ISP offers are much like those of 
On the other side of the pond
The ISP situation in the United Kingdom is a 
little different from the one in North America. 
For broadband, British Telecom (BT) and 
many competitors provide DSL service with 
(by American standards) high speeds at a low 
price as long as you sign up for at least a year 
at a time. The government forced BT to let other 
companies share its equipment, so you can 
often get a better deal on phone and DSL from 
other companies, using the exact same phone 
line. Look, for example, at www.greenbee.
com, from the John Lewis department store 
chain.
Cable modem service is also widely available, 
typically faster than BT and more expensive. 
You can also get wireless broadband from your 
mobile phone company, with a little dongle that 
plugs into a USB port on your PC, typically rea­
sonably priced until you exceed the monthly 
usage cap at which the price rapidly becomes 
unreasonable.
Traditionally, all phone calls in the United 
Kingdom (UK) have been charged by the 
minute, including even local calls, which can 
make long dialup online sessions mighty pricey. 
As a result, the UK now has three different kinds 
of dialup ISPs:
	✓	Traditional: These ISPs charge a modest 
monthly fee and provide access by way 
of either local numbers or national rate 
numbers. Unless you’re sure that you won’t 
spend much time online or your ISP pro­
vides another service you’re using, such as 
Web hosting, this type probably isn’t what 
you want.
	✓	Free: These ISPs charge no monthly fee; 
they support themselves by splitting the 
per-minute charges with BT. (BT would 
rather not, but OFTEL, the regulatory agency 
of the telecom industry in Britain, insists.) If 
you just want to try out the Net, free ISPs 
are a good way to start. We don’t recom­
mend them for long-term use because the 
per-minute split is less lucrative than the 
ISPs hoped, and free ISPs have a discon­
certing habit of going out of business on 
short notice. The tech support system also 
tends to be weak. (It’s free. What do you 
want — your money back?)
	✓	Flat-rate: These ISPs charge a monthly fee 
of about £20 but provide an 0800 or other 
number you can call without per-minute 
fees. Most dialup users find this choice the 
best because it makes the bill predictable. 
The largest flat-rate ISPs are AOL (yes, 
that AOL) and BT. Be warned that even 
though access is nominally unlimited, if you 
“camp” on the phone 20 hours a day, your 
ISP will invoke small print that you never 
noticed and cancel your account.
Depending on where you are and where your 
ISP is, your phone connection may be any­
where from wonderful to dreadful. If you try 
one ISP and keep getting slow or unreliable 
connections, try another.

61
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
another. If you don’t know what your local ISPs are, check the phone book or 
ads in the business section of your local paper.
	
If you’re not careful, you can end up paying more for the phone call than you 
do for your Internet account. Use an ISP whose number is a free or untimed 
local call (that is, you’re not paying by the minute). Nearly the entire continent 
is within a local call of an ISP; if you’re one of the unlucky few, see whether 
your phone company has an unlimited long-distance plan.
Your ISP should give you information to set up your account: your username 
and password, its dialup phone number, and your e-mail address if it’s differ­
ent from your username. Here’s how to set up your computer to dial up your 
ISP, depending on your version of Windows:
	
✓	Windows 7: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Internet➪
Network and Sharing Center➪Set Up a New Connection or Network.
	
✓	Windows Vista: Choose Start➪Connect To. In the window that opens, 
click the little Set Up a Connection or Network link. Click Set Up a 
Dial-Up Connection.
	
✓	Windows XP: Click the Start button and choose All Programs➪
Accessories➪Communications➪New Connection Wizard.
	
Enter the phone number as you would dial it on your phone, as 7, 10, or 11 
digits. Unless you share your computer with someone you don’t trust, select 
the check box to remember your password.
After your dialup account is set up, your computer should connect automati­
cally whenever you use your Web browser or e-mail program. You can also 
connect at any time. In Windows 7, click the Networking icon on the taskbar 
(it looks like the connection bars on a cellphone). In Windows Vista and 
XP, choose Start➪Connect To, and then click the dialup connection and the 
Connect button. If you see a dialog box that asks for your ISP username and 
password, type them and then click Connect.
I’m In!
When you’re connected to the Internet, you can monitor your connection or 
reconnect or disconnect. There’s a Networking icon on the Windows task­
bar; it’s in the lower right corner of the screen, to the left of the digital clock. 
Here’s where it is and what it does:
	
✓	Windows 7: A mobile phone-connection-bars Networking icon appears 
in the lower right corner of the screen. Click it to see what you’re con­
nected to. Click Open Network and Sharing Center at the bottom of its 
window to see more information (refer to Figure 4-2).

62
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
	
✓	Windows Vista: A two-computer-screen icon appears in the lower-right 
corner of the screen. Right-click the icon to see options.
	
✓	Windows XP: A two-computer-screen icon appears in the lower right 
corner of the screen. If you’re connected by way of wireless, you see one 
computer screen with radio waves coming out of it. Double-click this 
icon to check the speed of your Internet connection.
If you use a broadband account, you never need to disconnect. We love being 
able to saunter up to our computers at any time to check the weather, our 
e-mail, a good buttermilk waffle recipe, or which movies Joe E. Brown was in, 
without having to wait while for our computer to reconnect.
If you dial in to the Internet, you eventually want to disconnect (hang up) 
so that you can use your phone line to talk to actual human beings. You can 
leave the rest of your programs (such as your Web browser and e-mail pro­
gram) running even when you’re not connected to the Net. To disconnect a 
dialup connection, double-click or right-click the Networking icon, which we 
just described, and choose Disconnect.
Essential Software to Keep 
Your System Safe
Okay, you’re connected. Before you start surfing the Web, e-mailing, and 
instant messaging, you need to protect your computer from the Terrors of 
the Internet: viruses and spyware. Chapter 2 describes the concepts behind 
them, and now is the time to use protection.
Walling out the bad guys
A firewall is a barrier between your computer (or computers) and the 
Internet. In big companies, the firewall may consist of a computer that does 
nothing but monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic, checking for bad stuff. 
At your home or office, you have two good options:
	
✓	Use firewall software built into Windows 7, Vista, and XP. In Windows 7,
choose Start➪Control Panel➪System and Security➪Windows Firewall 
(see Figure 4-3). In Windows Vista, click the little Security Center 
shield in the notification area at the bottom of the screen and then 
click Windows Firewall. In Windows XP SP2, choose Start ➪Control 
Panel➪Security Center or Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Internet 
Connections ➪Network Connections, right-click the icon for your 
Internet account, choose Properties from the menu that appears, click 

63
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
the Advanced tab, and look for the Internet Connection Firewall or 
Windows Firewall section.
	
	If it’s not already selected, select the check box to turn on Internet 
Connection Firewall. When that’s done, your computers have basic pro­
tection from hackers.
	
✓	Use a router, a small box that sits between your computer (or computers) 
and your broadband modem. A router has one plug for a cable to your 
DSL or cable modem, several plugs (usually four) to which you can con­
nect computers, and usually an antenna for wireless Wi-Fi connections. 
The router has firewall software running all the time. See Chapter 5 for 
how to use a router to connect more than one computer to one Internet 
account.
	
Figure 4-3: 
Turn on the 
Windows 
built-in 
firewalls.
	
	
Even if you have only one computer that connects to the Internet, we recom­
mend using a router. If your broadband provider didn’t give you one they cost 
about $40 and we’re sure that you’ll want to hook up a second computer to 
the Internet before long. The firewall programs included in Windows 7, Vista, 
and XP work fine, too. Hey, why not use both?
	
A router is a particularly good idea if you have a broadband connection that is 
always on (that is, always connected). The router is always on, too.
No viruses need apply
Viruses are sneaky programs that arrive by way of e-mail or in downloaded 
programs, and immediately get up to no good. (See Chapter 2 for details.) 
You need to run a virus checker program all the time, and you need to update 
its list of viruses regularly so that the program can detect the latest viruses.

64
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
Many virus checkers are available. The free AVG from free.avg.com 
isn’t bad, particularly at the price. The big two commercial programs are 
McAfee VirusScan, which you can download from www.mcafee.com, and 
Norton AntiVirus, at www.symantec.com. These programs work fine, but 
are large and cost about $50 a year. If you have more than one computer on 
the Internet, consider F-Prot, at www.f-prot.com, because you have to pay 
for only one license (at $29 a year) to run the program on as many as five 
computers in your house. If you have several computers, note that Norton 
AntiVirus also has a 3-pack license.
	
Microsoft now has a virus checker named Windows Defender. It comes pre­
installed with Windows Vista, and you can download it for free for use on 
Windows 7 or XP. It’s at www.microsoft.com/windows/products/
winfamily/defender. (See Chapter 12 to find out how to download and 
install programs.)
The commercial programs require that you pay annually for a subscription 
to updates. Do it — without updates to the list of viruses it’s looking for, 
your program doesn’t spot and block recent viruses. Some bundle the virus 
checker with other security packages so that you can get all the protection 
you need in one purchase.
	
Don’t think that you’re saving money if you don’t subscribe to a virus-checking 
service. New viruses come out every day. Your virus checker can check for 
only the viruses it knows about. You need a service that updates your list of 
viruses to check for. It’s like the FBI sending out new Wanted posters to the 
local police.
AOL isn’t exactly the Internet, but it’s close enough
America Online (AOL) provides two things:
	✓	Dialup or high-speed access to the Internet
	✓	AOL software that includes a Web browser, 
an e-mail program, and other features 
that give you access to their own, propri­
etary services (such as AOL chat rooms). 
Windows and Mac versions are available. 
You get an AOL e-mail address, too.
You can use one or both of these services. 
For example, you can connect to the Internet 
through DSL or cable Internet and use the AOL 
software to browse the Web and read your 
e-mail. You can use the AOL broadband ser­
vice if it’s available in your area, but use other 
programs for Web browsing and e-mail. Or, you 
can use AOL for everything.
If you want to sign up for an AOL account to 
connect to the Internet, call 1-800-827-3338 and 
ask for a membership. The introductory pack­
age has instructions and a disc containing the 
AOL access program. Follow the instructions to 
install the program and sign up for an account. 
You need a credit card to sign up if you want 
to use AOL to connect to the Internet. (The 
AOL Web site, mail, and instant messenger 
services are free.) For more information about 
how to use AOL, get AOL For Dummies, by John 
Kaufeld and Ted Leonsis.

65
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
A good virus checker automatically connects to its home base over the 
Internet at least once a week and downloads updates to its virus lists. You 
may see a dialog box on your screen when this is happening. Your subscrip­
tion usually lasts a year, and you should see warnings to update your sub­
scription (that is, pay again) when your year is almost up.
For help with downloading and installing an antivirus program, see Chapter 12.
Detecting spyware
Spyware is a class of programs that sneak onto your computer, usually when 
you’re browsing the Web, and run unbeknownst to you, doing God-knows-
what. (See Chapter 2 for details.) A number of antispyware programs are 
available for free, although no single program seems to spot all types of spy­
ware. We recommend that you run several antispyware programs from time 
to time, to sweep your hard disk and look for bad stuff.
Along with Windows Defender, which is built into Vista and is a free down­
load for Windows 7 and Windows XP, the three free programs we use are
	
✓	Ad-Aware Personal Edition, at www.lavasoftusa.com. It’s also free, 
although the developer wants you to buy the fancier paid version.
	
✓	Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, at www.malwarebytes.org.
	
✓	Spybot Search & Destroy, at www.safer-networking.org. It’s share­
ware; donations are appreciated. Note that several unscrupulous pro­
grams have started using the word spybot in their names, so don’t just 
use a search engine to find the program; type in your Web browser the 
address shown in this paragraph.
These programs (and many others) are also available for free download from 
www.download.com. For help with downloading and installing a spyware-
checking program, see Chapter 12.
In addition, follow a few basic rules, which will make more sense after you 
read the later chapters of this book. (Don’t worry: We mention them again in 
those later chapters, too.) Here they are:
	
✓	Don’t use Internet Explorer as your browser. Most spyware is designed 
to use features of Internet Explorer to worm its way onto your computer. 
Instead, use Firefox or Chrome, as described in Chapter 6.
	
✓	Don’t use Internet Explorer within other applications. For example, 
some e-mail programs have an option to use Internet Explorer to display 
messages that contain HTML (Web formatting). Turn off these options.

66
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
	
✓	If you use Windows, turn on Automatic Updates, and download and 
install the updates it suggests. Microsoft issues security fixes to Windows 
at least once a month. Windows 7 and Vista download and install updates 
automatically unless you turn off this feature. In Windows 7, you can ensure 
that Automatic Updates are on by choosing Start➪Control Panel➪System 
and Security➪Windows Update. In Windows Vista, choose Start➪Control 
Panel➪Security➪Windows Update. In Windows XP, choose Start ➪
Control Panel➪Security Center or Start➪Control Panel➪Performance 
and Maintenance➪System. In the System Properties dialog box that 
appears, click the Automatic Updates tab. Choose the first or second 
option so that Windows lets you know when updates are available.
Our Favorite Internet Setup
You’re probably wondering, “The authors of this book have used the Internet 
forever. What do they recommend as the very best way to connect to it?” 
Okay, you’re probably not wondering that, but we wish you were. And we 
have the answer.
The best Internet setup (in our humble opinions) is this:
	
✓	A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux — they’re all good).
	
✓	A DSL or cable Internet account — broadband rocks! FiOS would be even 
better, but it isn’t offered where we live.
	
✓	A router, to provide a firewall between your computer (or computers) 
and the Internet
You’re Connected — Now What?
When you connect to your ISP, your computer becomes part of the Internet. 
You type stuff or click in programs running on your computer, and those pro­
grams communicate over the Net to do whatever it is they do for you.
You can run several Internet programs at a time, which can be quite handy. 
You may be reading your e-mail, for example, and receive a message describ­
ing a cool, new site on the World Wide Web. You can switch immediately 
to your Web browser program (usually Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or 
Chrome), look at the Web page, and then return to the mail program and pick 
up where you left off. Most e-mail programs highlight URLs (Web addresses) 
and enable you to go straight to your browser by clicking the URL in your 
e-mail message.

67
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Gear and Climbing on the Net
You’re not limited to running programs that your Internet provider gives you. 
You can download a new Internet application from the Net and begin using it 
immediately — your ISP just acts as a data conduit between your computer 
and the rest of the Net.
To find out more about using the Web, see Chapter 6. If you want to start off 
with e-mail, read Chapter 13. Or, just flip through the rest of this book to see 
what looks interesting!
Get rid of your Dell or Gateway software
Many computers come with Internet soft­
ware created by the hardware manufacturers, 
designed to give you an easier Internet experi­
ence. Unfortunately, we find that these programs 
just give you a more confusing Internet experi­
ence because each program is renamed to add 
the name of the hardware manufacturer. (AOL 
used to do this, too.) If your Dell or Gateway 
or other new computer comes with Dell or 
Gateway or other Internet programs, we rec­
ommend that you ignore them and use the stan­
dard Windows stuff described in this book. The 
polite name for this stuff is shovelware.

T
hese days, lots of families have more than one computer — perhaps 
one in the office, one in the family room, and one in their teenager’s 
bedroom. Hey, one of us has one in the kitchen for our family’s calendar and 
address book. And that’s not to mention the road warrior laptop.
Luckily, you don’t need a separate Internet connection for each computer. 
Instead, you can connect the computers into a network — with cables or 
through thin air with wireless Wi-Fi connections — and then set them up to 
share one Internet connection. This chapter shows you to set up both types 
of networks.
Maybe you already have a laptop, netbook, or smartphone or just got one — 
this chapter also talks about ways you can use them on the Internet both at 
home and on the road. If you set up Wi-Fi for your family or office, you can 
connect from almost all laptops, all netbooks, and many smartphones, too.
Just One Computer for Internet 
Access? Naah
Many years ago, back when computers were large, hulking things found only 
in glass-walled computer rooms, a wild-eyed visionary friend of ours claimed 
(to great skepticism) that computers would be everywhere, and would be so

small and cheap that they would show up as prizes in cereal boxes. We’re not 
sure about the cereal boxes, but it’s certainly true that the last time we went 
to put an old computer in the closet, we didn’t have room because of all the 
other old computers in there. Rather than let them rust in your closet, you 
may as well get some use out of them by connecting them all to the Internet.
With a broadband connection, it turns out to be pretty easy. No more argu­
ing about who’s going to use the phone line next! No more pouting from the 
computer users who didn’t get the cable or DSL hookup! Everyone can send 
e-mail, receive e-mail, chat, and browse the Web — all at the same time.
To share an Internet connection, you connect your computers to each other 
in a local-area network and then you connect the LAN (rather than an indi­
vidual computer) to the Internet. A local-area network (or LAN) is — drumroll, 
please! — a network entirely contained in one local area, like one building, 
and is connected by way of wires or wireless connections, with no phone 
lines within the LAN. Once the exclusive tool of businesses, LANs have 
become so cheap that they’re showing up in homes. As long as your home 
is in one building, if you have some computers connected to each other, you 
have a LAN.
Figure 5-1 shows a typical home network: A cable or DSL modem connects 
to a hardware router, a device that connects your LAN to your Internet con­
nection. Normally, you would connect your PC to a network hub (for a wired 
network) or an access point (for wireless) — but a hardware router has a hub 
or an access point built in. Then you connect the LAN to the rest of the com­
puters around the house.
	
The computers on your LAN don’t all have to be running the same version of 
Windows — or even running Windows. You can connect PCs, Macs, and Linux 
computers on the same LAN because they all speak the same networking pro­
tocol, the same protocol that the Internet itself uses (TCP/IP, if you were 
wondering).

 Chapter 5: Connecting with Wi-Fi, Laptops, and Smartphones
First, Make a LAN
LANs come in two basic varieties: wired and wireless. In a wired network, a 
cable runs from each computer to a central box, whereas a wireless network 
uses radio signals rather than wires. Either way, you need a central box, 
which we talk about in a minute. If all your computers are in one room (or 
you’re good at playing home electrician), a wired network is for you; other­
wise, wireless is far easier to set up, although the pieces can be more expen­
sive and the resulting network runs slower. Combos are also possible; most 
wireless equipment has a few jacks for wires to connect to the computers 
that are close enough to run cables.
The box in the middle — a hub, 
switch, or router
For any variety of current LAN, you need a special box that connects every­
thing. Here are the main kinds of boxes you have to choose from:
	
✓	A hub is a book-size box with a bunch of jacks for network cables. It serves 
as a wired connection point that links all your computers into a LAN.
	
✓	A switch is the same thing as a hub, but it has a little extra circuitry to 
speed things up.
	
✓	An access point is the wireless equivalent of a hub, with a radio antenna 
or two and only one jack to connect to a wired network.
	
✓	A router is like a hub with the addition of Internet-connection smarts, 
like a firewall (as described in Chapter 4, in the section about walling out 
the bad guys).
Our advice is to go for a router; it’s cheap ($40 to $80), and it saves you days 
of hair-tearing grief because it keeps most Windows worms out of your net­
work. With a router, none of your computers needs to worry about connect­
ing to the Internet — the router handles it.
Routers come in both wired and wireless versions. The wired versions have 
varying numbers of jacks, depending on how many computers you plan to 
connect to your wired LAN; the wireless ones have one jack for the cable to 
the modem, an antenna for the wireless network, and usually a few jacks for 
running wires to computers in the same room. For some perverse reason, 
wireless routers are usually cheaper than wired, even though the wireless 
ones include everything the wired ones do plus the wireless radio. So get a 
wireless router.

72
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
Setting up a router
A router invariably comes with a short Ethernet cable to connect the router to 
the cable or DSL modem, so connect your router to your modem, plug in both 
devices, and turn them on. An Ethernet cable (also known as Category 5, or 
Cat 5) looks like a fat phone cable, with little plastic connectors that look just 
like phone plugs but a little larger. (Even their technical names are a little 
larger; a phone connector is an RJ-11 jack, whereas an Ethernet connector is an 
RJ-45 jack.) Some ISPs provide a combined router and DSL modem, which has 
an RJ-11 jack for the DSL phone line rather than an incoming Ethernet jack.
Configuring routers for DSL connections 
that require a username and password
For the most part, routers take care of themselves, but if you have the kind 
of DSL connection that requires a username and password, you need to put 
those into the router. If your DSL connection doesn’t require a username and 
password, you can probably just skip this section, although you can come 
back later if a program you’re installing requires you to change the router’s 
configuration. Setup instructions for routers are all the same in concept, but 
they differ in detail from one router to another — so you may have to (gack!) 
glance at the instructions that came with the router.
Because the router doesn’t have a screen or keyboard that would enable 
you to configure it, you use a computer connected to the router instead, by 
way of a Web browser. The router has its own Web address, accessible only 
from the computers on your LAN; the address is usually a strange-looking, 
all-numeric creation. Even if you plan to have an entirely wireless LAN, the 
initial setup is a lot easier if you connect a PC (or Mac) to the router by using 
an Ethernet cable, at least for now, so that the router can figure out which 
computer it’s supposed to be talking to. (“Hey, there it is, at the other end of 
that wire!”) Follow these steps:
	
1.	Turn off the router and the PC (or Mac).
	
	 Computers are usually happier if you plug and unplug stuff while they’re 
turned off.
	
2.	Plug an Ethernet cable into the network adapter on your computer 
and plug the other end into one of the jacks on the router.
	
3.	Turn on the router and then turn on the computer.
	
4.	Fire up your Web browser and type the address of the router’s control 
page — its home page, with configuration settings.
	
	 Usually, this page is at 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.0.254 (special Web 
addresses reserved by the Internet powers that be for private networks 
like yours). If those Web addresses don’t work, check the router’s 
instructions.

73
 Chapter 5: Connecting with Wi-Fi, Laptops, and Smartphones
	
5.	If your router’s configuration page requires a username and password, 
check your router’s manual to find out what it is and then type it.
	
	 If you lost the manual, don’t panic: Often the username and password 
are printed on the bottom of the router. You see the configuration page 
for your router, something like Figure 5-2.
	
6.	If you have a broadband connection that uses a login and password, 
find the text box or field to enter your login name and password for 
your broadband connection.
	
	 Either follow the instructions in your router manual or try clicking the 
tabs or links on the page until you find boxes with names like Username 
and Password. Connections that use passwords may be called PPPoE 
(Point-to-Point over Ethernet, if you must know). Type them in.
	
7.	If you see a button or link named Save, Done, or OK, click it to make 
sure that the router saves your changes.
	
	 If you see no such button or link, don’t worry.
Now your router knows how to log in to your DSL account.

Connecting your LAN to the modem
Plug the router into your DSL or cable modem, turn on the modem (if it’s 
not on yet), restart the router (by unplugging the power cord and plugging 
it back in), and verify that you can connect to the outside Internet. If you 
have a combined DSL modem and router, plug the phone line into its DSL 

74
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
jack. (Try a visit to our home page at net.gurus.org.) If that doesn’t work, 
check the modem cable and ensure that both the username and password 
setup are correct if your Internet connection needs them. Most routers have 
reset switches that you can use to return them to their factory settings. It can 
take a long time, several minutes, for a DSL or cable modem to start the con­
nection, so you might check the little lights to see whether the one that says 
WAN (for wide-area network) is lit yet.
	
You can configure a bunch of other router settings that you shouldn’t need 
to worry about unless you’re planning to do something fancy. The firewall 
part of the router watches the Internet traffic as it passes through and blocks 
the traffic it doesn’t like. Routers let through Web pages, e-mail, instant mes­
sages, and other standard types of Internet communication, but if you’re doing 
something special, like playing some types of online gaming, you may need to 
tell your router to allow additional types of data. If an online game or another 
program indicates that you need to “open a port” on your router, you need to 
return to this router configuration Web page to make some changes.
Wiring your computers into a LAN
After you have the router set up, if you want to create a wired LAN, you need 
wires. (Okay, you already knew that.) Specifically, LANs use Cat 5 Ethernet 
cable with RJ-45 connectors — it looks the same as the cable you use to con­
nect your router to your modem. Cat 5 cable is available at any office supply 
store, electrical supply store, computer store, or even the occasional super­
market, and you can find it in varying lengths, from 10 feet to 50 feet or more. 
You need one cable to run from the router to each computer.
For each computer — PC, Mac, or whatever — plug one end of a Cat 5 cable 
into the computer’s network adapter jack. (See the section in Chapter 4 
about how your computer connects to the modem.) Plug the other end of the 
cable into the router.
After your computers are connected to the router and, indirectly, to each 
other, tell every computer about the LAN. Windows 7 and Vista make it easy — 
as soon as you plug in your network cable, Windows contacts the router 
and sets up your connection. (The most common problem: The cable isn’t 
plugged in all the way at one end or the other.) If it doesn’t, try these steps in 
Windows 7:
	
1.	Choose Start➪Computer➪Network.
	
	 You see a window showing the computers and networks that Windows 
thinks you’re connected to.
	
2.	Click Network and Sharing Center.
	
	 You see the window shown in Figure 4-2, over in Chapter 4.

75
 Chapter 5: Connecting with Wi-Fi, Laptops, and Smartphones
	
3.	Click Set Up a New Connection or Network if this is the first time, or 
Connect to a Network to connect to a network that already exists (such 
as someone else’s LAN).
In Windows Vista, try this:
	
1.	Choose Start➪Network.
	
2.	Click Network and Sharing Center to see which networks Windows 
thinks you’re connected to.
	
3.	Click the Diagnose and Repair link to help fix the most common 
problems.
On every Windows XP computer on the network, follow this drill:
	
1.	Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Communications➪Network 
Setup Wizard.
	
2.	Follow the wizard’s directions. When it asks what you want to 
do, choose the option labeled This Computer Connects through a 
Residential Gateway or through Another Computer on My Network.
	
	 The residential gateway is your router. On the next page, the wizard 
asks you to name your computer.
	
3.	When the wizard asks, give the computer a network name (such as 
PLAYROOM, OFFICE, or BOB).
	
	 When the wizard asks for the workgroup name, use the same name for 
all the computers on your LAN. (We use WORKGROUP. Windows may 
suggest MSHOME, which is fine too — just be consistent.)
If you connect a Mac to your LAN, it can probably see the LAN and work 
without your lifting a finger. If you do want (or need) to configure your net­
work connection and you use Mac OS 9 or earlier, choose Apple➪Control 
Panels➪TCP/IP to access the TCP/IP control panel. Or, run the Internet Setup 
Assistant by choosing your hard disk and then the Internet folder and then 
Internet Setup Assistant. In Mac OS X, your network software is named Open 
Transport. To configure it, open the System folder and then the Control 
Panels folder and then the TCP/IP control panel.

by Kathy Ivens.
Forget the Wires — Go Wi-Fi!
If you have computers in more than one room in the house, using Wi-Fi is 
easier than snaking wires through the walls or basement.

76
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
Most laptop PCs have Wi-Fi built in. For computers that don’t, you can get 
Wi-Fi PC cards, Wi-Fi doozits with USB connectors, and (less often) Wi-Fi 
add-in cards for desktop computers. Wi-Fi makers do a remarkably good job 
of adhering to industry standards, so you can expect anyone’s 11b or 11g or 
11n Wi-Fi equipment to work with anyone else’s.
The main practical difference among Wi-Fi equipment is range. Wi-Fi compo­
nents have one standard feature in common: laughably optimistic estimates 
of how far away they can be from other Wi-Fi equipment and still work. 
Bigger antennas bring you more range — as does more expensive equipment. 
Wi-Fi radio waves use the same band as 2.4GHz cordless phones, so you can 
expect roughly the same range — like a cordless phone, your Wi-Fi connec­
tion will probably work in most parts of your house but not down to the end 
of your driveway. If you have a normal-size house, normal Wi-Fi works fine. 
If you live in a $900,000 mansion, you might have to spring for the $100 Wi-Fi 
card rather than the $50 one.
Set a password, for Pete’s sake!
You would probably notice if a random stranger walked into your house and 
plugged into your wired network. (At least, we like to think we would notice.) 
However, if you have a Wi-Fi network and a stranger is out on the street with 
a laptop scanning the area for unprotected wireless access points (a practice 
known as wardriving), he can connect to your Wi-Fi network and you can’t 
easily tell. Some people don’t care — at least until they realize that wardriv­
ers can see all the shared files and printers on your LAN, and can send spam 
(and worse) through your network connection. You may well be able to hop 
on to your neighbors’ Wi-Fi networks, and they on yours, which may or may 
not be okay, depending on how much you like your neighbors.
Fortunately, all Wi-Fi systems have optional passwords. Cryptographers 
laugh derisively at the poor security of Wi-Fi passwords, but they’re adequate 
to make wardrivers and nosy neighbors go bother someone else. (If you have 
serious secrets on your network, don’t depend on Wi-Fi passwords. A bad 
guy using a laptop and one of the widely available Wi-Fi password-cracker 
programs can gather enough data from your network to break any password 
in less than a week. If you need better cryptographic protection, it’s avail­
able, but it’s not exactly a do-it-yourself project to set up.)
Those creative Wi-Fi engineers created several flavors of passwords, too. 
Most new Wi-Fi equipment uses the secure password scheme Wireless 
Privacy Access (WPA). If all your Wi-Fi equipment can handle it, use WPA. 
WPA passwords can be almost any length, so you can pick something you 
can remember. (Don’t use your last name or your address, which is likely 
to be the only information that a passerby might know about your house.) 
Some Wi-Fi equipment arrives configured with a network name and a random 

77
 Chapter 5: Connecting with Wi-Fi, Laptops, and Smartphones
password, which you might as well use. A card is usually included with the 
network name and password printed on it to help you set up your PCs.
Older Wi-Fi equipment can’t do WPA, and you may be stuck using the system 
named WEP, a term that allegedly means Wired Equivalent Privacy (which it’s 
not). WEP passwords come in two sizes: 64 and 128 bits. Use 128 unless you 
have old equipment that can do only 64, in which case, 64 will do. (Your entire 
network has to use the same size.) The password can be represented as either 
a text string or a hexadecimal (base-16, also called hex) number — we leave it 
to you to choose which would be easier for you to type and remember. If you 
use 64-bit WEP, your password (in text format) must be exactly 7 characters 
long. For 128-bit WEP, you need a 13-character password. If you want to use a 
shorter password, pad it out with digits or punctuation.
	
The easiest way to set the password is to set it up at the same time you set up 
your network, as described in the next section.
Making the Wi-Fi connection
To create a Wi-Fi system, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Get your router set up, and then set up your computers to connect to it.
	
	See the section “Setting up a router,” earlier in this chapter. Even if you 
plan to use an all-Wi-Fi network, to do the setup process, plug in one 
computer with a cable and use it to set up the Wi-Fi.
	
2.	Use your Web browser to display the router’s control page (usually at 
192.168.0.1) so that you can configure the router.
	
3.	Find the page where you can configure the router’s Wi-Fi settings.
	
	 What you click depends on your router. On our D-Link router, we clicked 
Setup and then Wireless Settings to open the page shown in Figure 5-3. 
Look for a page with settings about wireless, a network name, and wire­
less security.
	
4.	Give your network a name.
	
	 Every Wi-Fi network has a name. With typical machine imagination, your 
router suggests something like linksys (a router manufacturer) or 
dlink (another manufacturer) or default. We suggest something like 
FredsHouse so that any neighbors who happen on it know that it’s you.
	
5.	Turn on Wi-Fi passwords and set one, as described in the preceding 
section.
	
	Your router probably has lots of other options — such as MAC clon­
ing (less pomological than it sounds, and nothing to do with Macintosh 
computers), all of which you can ignore.

78
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
	
Figure 5-3: 
Configuring 
your router 
to do Wi-Fi 
with a 
password.
	
	
6.	When your router is up and running and your computer can see the 
Internet (that is, you can display Web pages), you’re done configuring 
the router for your Wi-Fi network.
Now, at last, you can cut the cord and go wireless. You need to tell every PC 
which Wi-Fi network to use and what the password is. On Windows 7 and 
Vista, the setup is quick:
	
1.	In Windows 7, click the Networking icon in the lower right corner of 
the screen, to the left of the digital clock. In Windows Vista, choose 
Start➪Connect To.
	
	 You see a window with a list of available networks, one of which is 
yours. If you have neighbors with Wi-Fi networks, it may show them, too, 
but don’t use your neighbors’ networks unless they give you permission.
	
2.	Double-click your network.
	
	 In a moment, you see a dialog box that asks for the security key or pass 
phrase.
	
3.	Enter the network password, exactly as you did on the router, and 
click Connect.
	
	 Windows retrieves network settings from the router, and in a few sec­
onds you’re online. If you have trouble typing the password, click the 
box to display the characters of the password (unless, we suppose, 
someone you don’t trust is looking over your shoulder.)

79
 Chapter 5: Connecting with Wi-Fi, Laptops, and Smartphones
If you’re using Windows XP SP2, the process is also fairly painless:
	
1.	Click Start➪Connect To➪Wireless Network Connection.
	
2.	After your PC sniffs the airwaves for a moment, Windows shows you a 
list of available networks, including the one you just set up.
	
3.	Click your network’s name and then the Connect button at the bottom 
of the window.
	
4.	Windows asks you to type the password, twice. Type the password, 
whether it’s text or hexadecimal, exactly as you did on the router.
	
5.	Click OK, and you should be online.
Windows remembers the wireless setup; in the future, it connects automatically.
Using Your Laptop or Netbook 
at Home and Away
The whole point of having a laptop computer is to take it with you when 
you travel — and what fun is traveling with a computer if you can’t use it to 
check your e-mail 17 times a day? Almost all laptops and absolutely all net­
books come with built-in Wi-Fi. After you set up your laptop or netbook on a 
home Wi-Fi network by following the instructions earlier in this chapter, you 
already know most of what you need to know to use it on other networks 
when you travel. All the information in this section about laptops applies to 
netbooks, too.
Windows Internet Connection Sharing? 
Get a router!
Windows Vista and XP come with Internet 
Connection Sharing (ICS) — adequate built-in 
router software — but there’s not much point 
in using it: You need a hub or router in order 
to connect your computers into a LAN anyway. 
With ICS, the computer running ICS must be 
awake and alert for any other computer to con­
nect, and problems with that computer (“Rats! 
My game just crashed!”) cause connection 
trouble for all the other computers. Who needs 
the hassle?

80
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
Home and office setup
Lots of people have laptops they take back and forth between home and the 
office. A lot of variables are involved in doing this successfully, depending on 
not only your particular laptop but also the networks you use at home and at 
the office. In general, however, this is how the various setups should work:
	
✓	If both home and the office have wired networks, your computer should 
work when it’s plugged into either network. If your computer doesn’t 
connect at work, talk to your network administrator.
	
✓	If your office has local shared files and printers and your house doesn’t, 
or vice versa, Windows complains and sulks if it can’t find them. As long 
as you don’t try to print to a printer that’s at the other place, though, 
you can go online just fine.
	
✓	If both the home and office networks are wireless, or one is wireless and 
the other is wired, set up each one as described earlier in this chapter, 
and your PC should automatically recognize whichever is available — 
that is, the network where you are.
Getting Wi-Fi with your latté
In olden days, people would go to a coffee shop and order cups of coffee, of 
which there was a maximum of two kinds, regular and decaf, and then chat 
with people sitting right next to them. Now, of course, that’s hopelessly 20th 
century. We cruise into the coffee shop with our laptop, order a half-caf 
single-shot mocha cappuccino grande with 2 percent milk, cocoa drizzle, 
hold the sprinkles, and we put on our Bluetooth earpiece and talk or 
exchange messages with people thousands of miles away, utterly ignoring 
the losers at the next table. The magic of Wi-Fi makes this possible, as coffee 
shops install Wi-Fi hotspots (public areas with Wi-Fi Internet access) to which 
customers can connect.
The amount of effort needed to get online at your coffee shop varies from 
none to way too much. At some places, the management has enough confi­
dence in its product to figure that if it can get you to stick around, you’ll keep 
buying coffee, so Wi-Fi is free to customers. (The coffee shop where John is 
sometimes found is in this category.) You turn on your computer; choose 
the Start➪Connect To command — if your computer doesn’t look for a Wi-Fi 
network by itself; click the name of the shop’s network when it appears; tell it 
that, yes, you really want to connect to that insecure network; and you’re on. 
The next time you come back, your computer remembers the network and 
connects automatically.

81
 Chapter 5: Connecting with Wi-Fi, Laptops, and Smartphones
Other places are less confident. A typical large chain — let’s call it Ahab’s —
made the Wi-Fi a profit center, so you have to pay by the hour. This fee adds 
an extra, annoying step to the connection process, the one where you pay. 
After your computer is turned on, fire up your Web browser. No matter what 
your home page is, the network is set up so that your browser shows its 
home page, which allows you to make payment arrangements.
There are about as many ways to pay for Wi-Fi access as there are flavors 
of coffee. Maybe you buy or are given a ticket at the counter with a code 
number to enter. More likely, the coffee shop made a deal with one of the 
large, national mobile phone providers, T-Mobile or AT&T, that make a side­
line of Wi-Fi. In this case, you pay with a credit card, either by the hour (at 
about $6 an hour) or by buying a package of hours. You sign up via your Web 
browser — the Wi-Fi network lets you connect to the sign-up page for free, 
but you have to sign up and pay to do anything else. If you plan to drink a 
great deal of coffee, you can sign up for a monthly flat-rate plan, or in some 
cases if you have mobile phone service from the provider, it tosses in a Wi-Fi 
account for cheap or free.
It’s not hard to get into the Wi-Fi café biz, so you can also find lots of tiny 
providers. Many of them have reciprocal agreements and alliances, such that 
(for example) if you sign up with someone who belongs to the iPass group, 
you can use another iPass member’s Wi-Fi hotspot.
Airports, hotels, and beyond
Coffee shops are hardly the only places that offer Wi-Fi. If you spend much 
time in airports (John does because he’s on a lot of advisory boards), you 
find lots of Wi-Fi — with about the same options as in the coffee shops. The 
same two providers dominate, with a lot of little local ones as well. After a 
while, frequent travelers learn Wi-Fi folklore — say that there’s free Wi-Fi in 
the airline club on the third level of the Pittsburgh airport, and even if you’re 
not a member, you can use it if you sit in one of the chairs near the door.
Hotels, like cafés, treat Wi-Fi as either a service — like the ice machine on 
each floor — or a profit center, like your room’s minibar full of overpriced 
beer. Some hotels still offer wired Internet connections (in which case a cable 
on the desk in your room plugs into your computer), and others go Wi-Fi. 
If you’re at an ice-machine-style hotel, you may just be able to turn on your 
computer and go online with no fuss, or you may have to sign in through 
your browser, even though you don’t have to pay. Some hotels with Wi-Fi 
give you a slip of paper with a login code when you register, to deter visi­
tors who would otherwise sit in the lobby and use it for free. In minibar-style 
hotels, you have to log in through your browser. Most hotels put the charge 

82
Part II: Internet, Here I Come! 
on the room bill; some want your credit card number so that they can bill 
you separately. The typical charge is $10 per day, from noon to noon, but 
we’ve seen hourly rates, lower rates, and higher rates. Some hotels bundle 
the rate in a business package with long-distance phone calls and some other 
goodies.
	
If you encounter a problem with a hotel’s Internet service, rarely does anyone 
at the hotel know anything about it, but they should be able to give you an 800 
number you can call to talk to someone at the company that provides the 
service.
The mail problem
Wi-Fi connections in coffee shops, airports, and hotels sure are convenient, 
but remember: They aren’t private. This is a particular problem when you 
send and receive e-mail, because you usually want your mail to be private 
and because your computer needs to send your network login and pass­
word over the Internet back to your mail server to pick up your mail. With 
a modest amount of advance planning, it shouldn’t be hard to get your mail 
working securely on the road.
Snoops at the coffee shop
Although we think that a lot of concerns about 
Internet network security are overblown, one 
place where it’s a real issue is on public Wi-Fi 
networks, like the ones in hotels and coffee 
shops. Those networks frequently have no 
passwords, which means that anyone on that 
network can snoop on your network connec­
tion. Even if everyone in the coffee shop seems 
nice, a snoop might be sitting in a car out by the 
curb. And in a hotel, of course, you have no idea 
who’s in all the nearby rooms.
Fortunately, taking a few simple precautions will 
keep you safe. When visiting Web sites, make 
sure that any site where you type a password 
or other private info uses SSL encryption: The 
address starts with https://, and the little 
lock in the corner is locked. If the site doesn’t 
have SSL encryption, wait until you get home. 
For advice on securing your mail program, see 
the section “The mail problem,” a little later 
in this chapter. If you see a network named 
Free Public Wi-Fi, do not use it, because it is 
a password-stealing virus running on a nearby 
infected PC.

 Chapter 5: Connecting with Wi-Fi, Laptops, and Smartphones
The simplest approach is webmail — a secure Web site where you can log in 
to read and send mail. It’s worth checking to see whether your mail system 
offers optional webmail. If so, even if you don’t use it at home, you might 
want to use it on the road, particularly if the webmail offers a secure server. 
To find out how Web-based mail works, see the section in Chapter 13 about 
the Web being a fine place to read your e-mail. Normally, we don’t worry 
about secure Web sites (https:// versus http://), but public Wi-Fi is one 
of the few cases where people might actually be snooping and the https secu­
rity helps.
	
If you really want to be paranoid, create an account at Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! 
Mail, or another webmail site, use it during your trip, and then close the 
account when you get back home.
Using Your Smartphone on the Net
The newfangled, Internet-enabled smartphone is a tiny little computer that 
happens to have a phone antenna, a microphone, and speakers built in. Some 
types of phones can also communicate using Wi-Fi, which is faster than a 
phone connection and doesn’t move data over the cellphone system (which 
you may pay for by the megabyte).
Like computers, which come primarily in Windows, PC, and Linux varieties, 
smartphones come in several flavors, based on which operating system they 
run. Most of these types of smartphone allow you to download additional 
programs (applications) from a Web site. Some applications are free, and 
others cost 99 cents or more.
The major types of smartphones are described in this list:
	
✓	Android: This system is open source (anyone can see the code and create 
compatible software). Because it’s sponsored by Google, you can use 
your Google Apps (such as Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Maps) 
on these phones. Android phones are available from HTC, Motorola, and 
Samsung, and Dell may climb on board, too. The T-Mobile G1 and G2 
were the first widely available Android phones.
	
✓	BlackBerry: The BlackBerry was the first widely used smartphone that 
made it easy to send and receive e-mail. All BlackBerry phones are made 
by Research in Motion (RIM).
	
✓	iPhone: The iPhone is a beautiful thing, and its sleek design created a 
huge sensation when it debuted in 2007. All iPhones are made by Apple, 
and none (as of the end of 2009) has a keyboard. Figure 5-4 shows an 
iPhone displaying e-mail.

Figure 5-4: 
Use your 
smartphone

send e-mail, 
browse the 
Web, and

Internet 
services.
	
	
✓	Palm webOS: Palm made some of the first smartphones. Palm phones 
come in both Palm webOS (such as the Palm Pre) and Windows Mobile 
varieties.
	
✓	Symbian: This system is used by Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, and lots of 
phones in Japan.
	
✓	Windows Mobile: A variety of phones use a version of Windows 
designed for phones and other handheld devices. Windows Mobile 
phones are available from Palm, Samsung, and T-Mobile.
For each of these smartphone operating systems, you can buy a variety of 
different phones in different shapes and sizes. Some have little keyboards, 
some flip open, some have larger screens, some are bigger or heavier, some 
can connect to the Internet by way of Wi-Fi as well as by using the cellphone 
system — you get the idea. Shop around. New smartphone models are avail­
able every month.
All smartphones come with a Web browser and an e-mail program. (Otherwise, 
what’s smart about them?) You can download other programs, including maps 
(Google Maps has a smartphone version), instant messaging (to communicate 
with AIM users, for example), and Internet games. Most can also play Internet 
audio and video files, so you can watch YouTube during your commute, prefer­
ably if someone else is driving.

85
 Chapter 5: Connecting with Wi-Fi, Laptops, and Smartphones
In most cases, each smartphone is available from and will work with only one 
carrier, so if you have preferences among carriers, you limit your choice of 
phones. Be sure you understand the monthly plan that comes with the phone 
and that the monthly data quota matches your usage. If you just check text 
mail a few times a day, an itty-bitty plan is enough, but if you plan to stream 
video an hour each way on your commute, you need an all-you-can-eat plan.
For much more information on smartphones and the mobile Internet, see 
Mobile Internet For Dummies, written and published by people you know 
and trust.
Please don’t call it a CrackBerry
One of the best innovations in e-mail, or the 
worst, depending on your point of view, is the 
BlackBerry. It’s a combined mobile phone and 
e-mail device. Grown people in business suits 
nervously punch the Check Mail button every 
few seconds like trained lab rats, and when 
the entire BlackBerry system failed for a day 
in April 2007, you could hear the screams clear 
from the Arctic Circle to the Rio Grande. It was 
the first step in what has turned into the world 
of Web-enabled phones.
On the other hand, if you truly need to stay in 
touch every minute of every day, a BlackBerry 
is helpful. It can have its own e-mail address, or 
more often it receives copies of the same mail 
sent to your regular computer at work. You can 
read and send mail very much like you do on a 
regular computer, and with a little practice you 
can become surprisingly efficient at typing on the 
teensy keys and small screen. President Obama 
managed to talk his security staff into letting him 
keep his BlackBerry in the White House.

N
o doubt about it, the Web is the happenin’ place. 
For many people, the World Wide Web is the 
Internet. We explain what the Web is and how to get 
around, and we give you helpful tips about how to find 
truly interesting and useful stuff among the millions of 
clamoring Web pages. We take a break to listen to lots of 
online music and watch online videos. Then, relaxed and 
refreshed, we tell you about Web shopping and Web bank­
ing so that you can confidently spend and save your 
money online, and then we wrap up with ways to get free 
(and almost free) software and other downloadable stuff 
from the Web.

Chapter 6
Welcome to the Wild, 
Wonderful, Wacky Web
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding Web pages and URLs
▶	Pointing, clicking, browsing, and other basic skills
▶	Discovering the Web from your phone
▶	Discovering Internet Explorer and Firefox
▶	Installing a browser other than Internet Explorer
P
eople now talk about the Web more than they talk about the Internet. 
The World Wide Web and the Internet aren’t the same thing — the World 
Wide Web (which we call the Web because we’re lazy typists) lives “on top of” 
the Internet. The Internet’s network is at the core of the Web, and the Web is 
an attractive parasite that requires the Net for survival.
This chapter explains what the Web is and where it came from. Then it describes 
how to install and use some popular Web browsers, and how to use Web 
browsers to display Web pages. If you’re already comfortable using the 
Web, skip to Chapter 7.
What Is the Web?
So what is the Web, already? The Web is a bunch of “pages” of information 
connected to each other around the globe. Each page can be a combination 
of text, pictures, audio clips, video clips, animations, and other stuff. (People 
add new types of other stuff every day.) What makes Web pages interest­
ing is that they contain hyperlinks, usually called just links because the Net 
already has plenty of hype. Each link points to another Web page, and, when 
you click a link, your browser fetches the page the link connects to. (Your 
browser is the program that shows you the Web — read more about it in a 
couple of pages.)

90
Part III: Web Mania 
The other important characteristic of the Web is that you can search it — all 
ten billion or so pages. For example, in fewer than ten seconds, you can find a 
list of Web pages that contain the phrase domestic poultry or your own name 
or the name of a book you want to find out about. You can follow links to see 
each page on the list to find the information you want. See Chapter 8 to see 
how to use a search engine to search the Web.
Linking up Web pages
Each page your browser finds for you can have more links that take you 
to other places. Pages can be linked to other pages anywhere in the world 
so that when you’re on the Web, you can end up looking at pages from 
Singapore to Calgary, or from Sydney to Buenos Aires, all faster than you can 
say “Bob’s your uncle,” usually. Most of the time you’re only seconds away 
from any site, anywhere in the world. This system of interlinked documents 
is known as hypertext.
Figure 6-1 shows a Web page (our Web page, in fact). Each underlined phrase 
is a link to another Web page.
Where did the Web come from?
The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 at 
the European Particle Physics Lab in Geneva, 
Switzerland, an unlikely spot for a revolution in 
computing. The inventor is a British researcher 
named Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is now the 
director of the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the 
organization that sets standards and loosely 
oversees the development of the Web. Tim is 
terrifically smart and hard working and charm­
ing. (Margy met him through Sunday school — 
is that wholesome or what?)
Tim invented HTTP (HyperText Transport 
Protocol), the way Web browsers commu­
nicate with Web servers; HTML (HyperText 
Markup Language), the language in which Web 
pages are written; and URLs (Uniform Resource 
Locators), the addresses used for Web pages 
and most other information on the Net. He envi­
sioned the Web as a way for everyone to pub­
lish and read information on the Net. Early Web 
browsers had editors that let you create Web 
pages almost as easily as you could read them.
For more information about the development 
of the Web and the work of the World Wide 
Web Consortium, visit its Web site, at www.
w3.org. You can also read Tim’s book, 
Weaving the Web (HarperOne, 1999). He was 
knighted in 2004 and became Sir Tim.

91
 Chapter 6: Welcome to the Wild, Wonderful, Wacky Web
Links can create connections that let you go directly to related information. 
These invisible connections between pages resemble the threads of a spider 
web — as you click from Web page to Web page, you can envision the “web” 
created by the links. What’s remarkable about the Web is that it connects 
pieces of information from all around the planet, on different computers and 
in different databases (a feat you would be hard pressed to match with a card 
catalog in a brick-and-mortar library).
Where’s that page?
Before you jump onto the Web (boing-g-g — that metaphor needs work), 
you need to know about one more basic concept. Every Web page has an 
address so that browsers, and you, can find it. Great figures in the world of 
software engineering (one guy, actually, named Sir Tim Berners-Lee) named 
this address URL, or Uniform Resource Locator. Every Web page has a URL, 
a series of characters that begins with http://. (How do you say “URL”? 
Everyone we know pronounces each letter, “U-R-L” — no one says “earl.”) 
Now you know enough to go browsing. For more entirely optional details 
about URLs, see the later sidebar “Duke of URL.”

Part III: Web Mania 
Browsing to Points Unknown
Maybe you have some time to check out the Web for yourself. To do this, you 
need a browser, the program that finds Web pages and displays them on your 
screen. Fortunately, if you have any recent version of Windows, any recent 
Mac, any netbook, almost any other computer with Internet access, or a 
smartphone, you probably already have one.
Here are the most popular browsers:
	
✓	Internet Explorer (IE) is the browser that Microsoft has built into every 
recent version of Windows. About 75 percent of people use IE. The latest 
version is 8, shown in Figure 6-2, which comes with Windows 7 and is 
available as a free download for many earlier versions of Windows (at 
microsoft.com/ie) but not for the Mac. IE also runs on Windows Mobile 
smartphones. Previous versions of IE look a little different, but usually 
try to update themselves to the latest version, so you’re likely to end up 
with IE 8 (or whatever comes after it).
	
✓	Firefox (refer to Figure 6-1) is the browser from the open source Mozilla 
project at www.mozilla.org. You can download Firefox for free for 
Windows, Macs, and Linux computers; the latest version as of late 2009 
is version 3.5. Firefox is used by about 25 percent of Web users, runs 
faster than Internet Explorer, and is much, much less susceptible to 
spyware. See the nearby sidebar “Our advice: Switch from Internet 
Explorer to Firefox or Chrome.”
	
✓	Chrome, shown in Figure 6-3, is from Google, the huge company respon­
sible for the Google.com search site and lots and lots of free Web-based 
services. You can download it for free for Windows, Macs, and Linux 
at chrome.google.com. Google appears to have a plan for Chrome to 
become its own operating system, competing with Windows.
	
✓	Safari, shown in Figure 6-4, is the Apple browser for the Mac, iPhone, 
and iPod touch. Windows has a version, too, although we’ve never heard 
of anyone other than us using it. You can download the latest versions 
from apple.com/safari.
We describe Internet Explorer and Firefox in detail in this book, and we men­
tion Chrome here and there. All browsers are similar, enabling you to view 
Web pages, print them, and save the addresses of your favorite pages so that 
you can return to them later. If you want to try a different browser, see the 
section “Getting and Installing a Browser,” later in this chapter.

Web Surfing with Your Browser
When you start your Web browser — Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, 
Safari, or whatever — you see a window that displays one Web page, with 
menus and icons along the top. Figure 6-1 (shown earlier in this chapter) 
illustrates Firefox, Figure 6-2 shows Internet Explorer 8, and Figure 6-3 shows 
the Google Chrome browser. Other browsers look similar, but with different 
menus and icons along the top.
Which page your browser displays at startup — your start page — depends on
how it’s set up. Many ISPs arrange for your browser to display their home pages; 
otherwise, until you choose a home page of your own, IE tends to display a 
Microsoft page, and Firefox usually shows a Mozilla-branded Google search page. 
Chapter 7 explains how to set the start page to a Web page you want to see.
The main section of the browser window is taken up by the Web page you’re 
looking at. After all, that’s what the browser is for — displaying a Web page! 
The buttons, bars, and menus around the edge help you find your way 
around the Web and do things like print and save pages.
Here are some of the most important buttons and menus at the top of your 
browser window:
	
✓	Back button: Click to display to the last page you looked at, as 
described in the later section “Backward, ho!”
	
✓	Reload or Refresh button: Click to reload the page you’re looking at 
now from the Web.
	
✓	Home button: Click to display your start page (or home page), as 
described in Chapter 7.

95
 Chapter 6: Welcome to the Wild, Wonderful, Wacky Web
	
✓	Address box: Displays the Web address (URL) of the current page. You 
can enter the URL of a page to display, as described in the later section 
“Going places.”
	
✓	Search box: Firefox, IE, and Safari have a search box, to the right of the 
address box, where you can type search terms. See Chapter 8 for details.
The rest of this chapter explains how to use these and other features of your 
browser.
Getting around
You need two simple skills (if we can describe something as basic as a single 
mouse click as a skill) to get going on the Web. One is to move from page to 
page on the Web, and the other is to jump directly to a page when you know 
its URL. Okay, we know that you aren’t actually moving — your Web browser 
displays one page after another — but browsing feels as though you’re cruising 
(or surfing, depending on which metaphor you prefer) around the Web.
Our advice: Switch from Internet Explorer to 
Firefox or Chrome
Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome are free 
and downloadable from the Internet, but beyond 
that, they have some important differences.
The advantages of Firefox and Chrome
	✓	Firefox and Chrome run faster. They’re 
smaller and quicker. Chrome is even faster 
than Firefox.
	✓	Firefox and Chrome don’t use ActiveX con­
trols, a feature of IE that spyware uses to 
infect your computer.
The advantages of Internet Explorer
	✓	Some Web sites (mainly sites run by 
Microsoft itself) require Internet Explorer 
because they use ActiveX controls.
	✓	If you use Windows, you already have IE 
because it comes bundled with Windows.
	✓	A few add-ins work only with IE.
Any browser can display and print Web pages — 
don’t get us wrong. However, we think that the 
security issue — avoiding spyware — trumps 
all other considerations hands down, and we 
recommend that you install Firefox or Chrome 
and use it except for the few Web sites that 
require Internet Explorer. You can have more 
than one browser installed at the same time — 
you can even have two or three running at the 
same time — so switching to Firefox or Chrome 
doesn’t mean that you can never use Internet 
Explorer again.
If you decide to try Firefox, you can choose 
Help➪For Internet Explorer Users to see a 
pageful of helpful information.

96
Part III: Web Mania 
Duke of URL
The World Wide Web will eventually link 
together all the information in the known uni­
verse, starting with all the stuff on the Internet. 
(This statement may be a slight exaggeration, 
but not by much.) One key to global domination 
is to give everything a name so that no matter 
what a Web page link refers to, a Web browser 
can find it and know what to do with it.
Look at this typical URL:
http://airinfo.travel/
index.phtml
The first item in a URL, the letters that appear 
before the colon, is the scheme, which describes 
the way a browser can get to the resource. 
Although ten schemes are defined, the most 
common by far is HTTP, which stands for 
HyperText Transfer Protocol, the Web’s native 
transfer technique. HTTP is the language that 
your browser uses to request a Web page from 
the Web server on which it’s stored, and that 
the Web server uses to send you back the page 
you want to see. (A conversation in HTTP can be 
translated into English as something like this: “I’d 
like a Web page, please.” “Here it is. Enjoy!”)
Although the details of the rest of the URL 
depend on the scheme, most schemes look 
similar. Following the colon are two slashes 
(always forward slashes, never backslashes) 
and the name of the host computer on which 
the resource lives; in this case, airline.
travel (one of the many names of John’s 
Internet host computer). Then comes another 
slash and a path, which gives the name of the 
resource on that host; in this case, a file named 
index.phtml.
Web URLs allow a few other optional parts. 
They can include a port number, which speci­
fies, roughly speaking, which of several pro­
grams running on that host should handle the 
request. The port number goes after a colon 
after the host name, like this:
http://airline.travel:80/
index.phtml
The standard http port number is 80, so if 
that’s the port you want (it usually is), you 
can leave it out. Finally, a Web URL can have 
a query part at the end, following a question 
mark, like this:
http://airline.travel:80/
index.phtml?chickens
When a URL has a query part, it tells the host 
computer more specifically what you want the 
page to display. (You rarely type query parts 
yourself — they’re often constructed for you 
from fill-in fields on Web pages.)
When you type a URL into your Web browser, 
you can leave out the http:// part because 
the browser adds it for you. Lazy typists, unite! 
When a Web address starts with www, you can 
usually leave that out, too.
Another useful URL scheme is mailto. A 
mailto URL looks like this:
mailto:internet12@gurus.org
That is, a mailto link is an e-mail address. 
Clicking a mailto URL runs your e-mail pro­
gram and creates a new message addressed 
to the address in the link.

97
 Chapter 6: Welcome to the Wild, Wonderful, Wacky Web
Moving from page to page is easy: Click any link that looks interesting. That’s 
it. Underlined blue text and blue-bordered pictures are links, and sometimes 
other things are, too. Anything that looks like a button is probably a link. You 
can tell when you’re pointing to a link because the mouse pointer changes to 
a little hand. Clicking outside a link selects the text you click, as in most other 
programs. Sometimes, clicking a link moves you to a different place on the 
same page rather than to a new page.
Backward, ho!
	
Web browsers remember the last few pages you visited, so if you click a link 
and decide that you’re not so crazy about the new page, you can easily go 
back to the preceding one. To go back, click the Back button on the toolbar. 
Its icon is an arrow pointing to the left, and it’s the leftmost button on the tool­
bar, as shown in Figures 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3. Or, press Alt+←.
Sometimes, clicking a link opens the new page in a new browser window 
or tab— your browser (IE or Firefox) can display more than one Web page 
at the same time, each in its own window or in tabs in one window. If a link 
opens a new window or tab, the Back button does nothing in that window.
Going places
Someone tells you about a cool Web site and you want to take a look. Here’s 
what you do:
	
1.	Click in the Address box near the top of the browser window.
	
	 Figures 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3 show where the Address box is in IE, Firefox, and 
Chrome. Pressing F6 also gets you to the Address box.
	
2.	Type the URL in the box.
	
	 The URL is something like http://net.gurus.org — you just type 
net.gurus.org. Be sure to delete the URL that appeared before you 
started typing.
	
3.	Press Enter.
	
Here are a few shortcuts:
	
✓	If the entire address in the Address box is highlighted, when you type, the 
new URL replaces what was there before. To highlight the entire old 
address, click in the Address box not once, not twice, but three times.

98
Part III: Web Mania 
	
✓	You can leave the http:// off the URLs when you type them in the 
Address box. Your browser can guess that part! Many Web addresses 
include a name that ends with .com, but not all do. See the later sidebar 
“Why .com?” for more information.
	
✓	When you start typing a URL, your browser helpfully starts guessing 
the address you might be typing, suggesting addresses you’ve already 
typed that start with the same characters. The browser displays its sug­
gestions in a list just below the Address box. If you see the address you 
want on the list, click it — no point in typing the rest of the URL if you 
don’t have to!
If you receive URLs in e-mail, instant messages, or documents, try clicking 
them — many programs pass along the address to your browser. Or, use the 
standard cut-and-paste techniques and avoid retyping:
	
1.	Highlight the URL in whichever program it appears.
	
	 That is, use your mouse to select the URL so that the whole URL is 
highlighted.
	
2.	Press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac) to copy the info to the Clipboard.
	
3.	Click in the Address box to highlight whatever is in it.
	
4.	Press Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to paste the URL into the box, and then 
press Enter.
	
Bad guys can easily create e-mail messages where the URL you see in the text 
of a message isn’t the URL you visit; the bad guys can hide the actual URL. 
Keep this warning in mind if you receive mail that purports to be from your 
bank — if you click the link and enter your account number and password in 
the Web page that appears, you may be typing it into a Web site run by crooks 
rather than by your bank. See the section “Phishing for inphormation” in 
Chapter 2.
The best place to start browsing
You find out more about how to find things on the Web in Chapter 8, but for 
now, here’s a good way to get started: Go to the Yahoo! News page. (Yes, the 
name of the Web page includes an exclamation point — it’s very excitable.) 
To find Yahoo! News, type this URL in your browser’s Address box and then 
press Enter:
news.yahoo.com
The Yahoo! Web site includes lots of different features, but its news site should 
look familiar — it’s like a newspaper on steroids. Just nose around, clicking

you make a wrong turn. We guarantee that you’ll find something interesting.

corrections to this book, you can find them there. If you find mistakes in 
this book or have other comments, by the way, please send e-mail to us at 
internet12@gurus.org.
Why .com?
When you want to put information on the 
Internet with your own name on it, you regis­
ter a domain name such as yahoo.com or 
wikipedia.org. A domain name for an 
ISP in the United States usually ends with a dot 
and a two- or three-letter code (which is the 
top-level domain, or TLD) that gives you a clue 
to what kind of outfit owns the domain name. 
The following list briefly explains which type 
of organization owns domains with which TLD 
codes:
	✓	Commercial organizations typically own 
domain names ending in .com, such as 
google.com (the most popular Web 
search site, described in Chapter 8), 
aa.com (AMR Corporation, better known 
as American Airlines), greattapes.
com (Margy’s online video store), and 
taugh.com (John’s hard-to-pronounce 
Taughannock Networks). Because “dot-
com” has become a synonym for the 
Internet itself, lots of other organizations 
and even individuals have .com domains.
	✓	U.S. colleges and universities typically 
own domain names ending in .edu (such 
as yale.edu).
	✓	Networking organizations typically end 
with .net. These include ISPs, such as 
comcast.net, and companies that pro­
vide network services.
	✓	Government organizations in the United 
States typically own domain names ending 
in .gov. For example, the National Do 
Not Call Registry, run by the Federal Trade 
Commission, is at donotcall.gov.
	✓	U.S. military organizations use domain 
names ending in .mil.
	✓	Nonprofits and special interest groups typ­
ically own domain names ending in .org. 
For example, the Unitarian Universalist 
Association (where Margy works) is at 
uua.org.
	✓	Organizations in specific countries fre­
quently own domain names ending in 
two-letter country codes, such as .fr for 
France or .zm for Zambia. See our Web 
site (at net.gurus.org/countries) 
for a listing of country TLD codes. Small 
businesses, local governments, and K-12 
schools in the United States usually end 
with the two-letter state abbreviation fol­
lowed by .us (such as John’s church Web 
site at unitarian.ithaca.ny.us).

Part III: Web Mania 
Who makes up these TLDs?
An international group (the Internet Corporation 
for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, 
at icann.org) is in charge of TLDs (top-level 
domains). In 1997, ICANN proposed adding 
some extra, generic domains, such as .firm, 
.arts, and .web. After a lengthy detour 
through a maze of international intellectual-
property politics, the first new domains (.biz 
and .info) appeared in 2001. The result is 
confusion that practically guarantees that, 
more often than not, whatever.biz and 
whatever.info are owned by the same 
group that owns whatever.com, and when 
they’re owned by someone else, they’re usually 
sleazy knockoffs. ICANN has since added these 
domain extensions:
	✓	 .name: Personal vanity domains
	✓	 .pro: Licensed professional doctors, 
­lawyers, and accountants
	✓	 .coop: Co-ops
	✓	 .museum: Museums
	✓	 .aero: Air travel
	✓	 .jobs: Job offers
	✓	 .travel: Travel in general
	✓	 .mobi: For people using cellphones and 
other mobile devices
	✓	 .asia: For people in Asia
	✓	 .cat: For people in Catalonia (where 
Barcelona is)
	✓	 .tel: An online directory for Internet tele­
phone users
None is widely used, although .mobi has a 
reasonable chance of success because of 
enthusiastic support from mobile phone compa­
nies. However, many Web sites have versions 
designed for smartphones (and other devices 
with small screens) with names that start with 
m., like m.yahoo.com.
ICANN is planning to throw open the domain 
floodgates to anyone who fills out the appli­
cation form and sends it in with a check for a 
modest $185,000 application fee. By the time 
you read this sidebar, lots more TLDs might 
exist. Even if they do, we doubt any of them will 
be important.
What not to click
	
The Web has some bad neighborhoods, and it’s not always safe to click what­
ever you see. For example, clicking a link on a Web page can download and 
install a program on your computer, and that program might not be one you 
want to be running. So, exercise judgment when clicking. Here are some links 
not to click:
	
✓	Don’t click ads claiming that you just won the lottery or a free laptop or 
anything else too good to be true.
	
✓	Don’t click messages on Web pages claiming that your computer is at 
risk of some dire consequence if you don’t click there. Yeah, right.

101
 Chapter 6: Welcome to the Wild, Wonderful, Wacky Web
	
✓	Don’t click OK in a dialog box that asks about downloading or installing 
a program, unless you’re deliberately downloading and installing a 
program (as we describe in Chapter 12).
	
✓	Don’t click any link that makes you suspicious. Your instincts are 
probably correct!
If one of these messages appears in a browser window, the safest thing is 
to close the window by clicking the X box in the upper right corner (or on a 
Mac, the red Close button in the upper left corner).
This page looks funny, or out of date
Sometimes, a Web page becomes garbled on the way in or you interrupt it 
(by clicking the Stop button on the toolbar or by pressing the Esc key). You 
can tell your browser to retrieve the information on the page again. Click the 
Reload or Refresh button (shown in Figures 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3) or press Ctrl+R.
	
Some people hardly ever close their browsers, which probably isn’t a good 
idea for their long-term mental stability. (Naturally, we’re not talking about 
anyone we know! Definitely not.) If you‘re such a person, however, remember 
that your browser caches pages — it stores the pages temporarily on your 
hard disk for quick retrieval. If you want to make sure that you’re seeing an 
up-to-date version of a page, reload it.
Get me outta here
Sooner or later, even the most dedicated Web surfer has to stop to eat or 
attend to other bodily needs. You leave your browser in the same way you 
leave any other program: Click the Close (X) button in the upper right corner 
of the window (or on a Mac, the red Close button in the upper left corner) 
or press Alt+F4. Or, just leave the program running and walk away from your 
computer.
Browsing from Your Smartphone
Internet-connected phones — such as the iPhone and the BlackBerry and 
phones that run Android, Palm webOS, or Windows Mobile — can browse the 
Web, too. So can the iPod touch, if you have a Wi-Fi connection. Of course, 
you can see only teeny, tiny Web pages on their teeny, tiny screens, but 
phone-based browsing can still be incredibly useful, especially when you’re 
looking for a good restaurant recommendation.

102
Part III: Web Mania 
The iPhone and the iPod touch come with Safari (the Apple Web browser), 
Windows Mobile phones come with IE (the Microsoft Web browser), and 
Android phones come with Chrome (the Google Web browser). All these pint-
size Web browsers have Back buttons and Address boxes and most of the 
same basic features as their larger siblings.
	
Some Web pages look great on smartphones, when the Web page designers 
create special versions that fit the small screens, dispensing with extraneous 
columns and graphics. Other pages are practically unreadable. As phone-
based browsers become more popular, more Web sites will have sites custom­
ized for mobile devices. If you find a site that’s unusable, try adding m. to the 
domain name or change the last part of the name to .mobi to see whether the 
site has a mobile version. For example, m.netflix.com is the spare, usable, 
version of the Netflix site designed for phones, and yahoo.mobi is the teeny 
screen version of Yahoo!.
Getting and Installing a Browser
Chances are, a browser is already installed on your computer. If you use 
Internet Explorer, we think you’re better off installing either Firefox or 
Chrome, for speed and safety reasons. Fortunately, browser programs aren’t 
difficult to find and install, and both Firefox and Chrome are free.
	
Even if you already have a browser, new versions come out every 20 minutes 
or so, and it’s worth knowing how to upgrade because occasionally the new 
versions fix some bugs so that the browsers are better than the old versions. 
Microsoft gives away Internet Explorer, the Mozilla project gives away Firefox, 
and Google gives away Chrome, so you might as well upgrade to the current 
version.
Getting the program
To get or upgrade Firefox (for Windows or Mac or any of the other dozen 
computers it runs on), visit www.mozilla.com. To get or upgrade Chrome, 
go to chrome.google.com. To get or upgrade Internet Explorer, go to www.
microsoft.com/ie. Use your current browser to go to the page and then 
follow the instructions for finding and downloading the program. You might 
also want to consult Chapter 12 for details.

103
 Chapter 6: Welcome to the Wild, Wonderful, Wacky Web
	
If you’re upgrading from an older version of your browser to a newer one, you 
can replace the old version with the new one. The installation program should 
be smart enough to remember your old settings and bookmarks (favorites). 
Some browsers automatically notify you when new versions are available, and 
you can just click Yes or Continue to download and install the new version. 
Updates to IE are included in the Microsoft Windows Update system, which is 
part of Windows.
Running a new browser for the first time
To run your new browser, click the browser’s attractive new icon. If you use 
Windows, the default browser also appears at the top of the left column of 
the Start menu, too.
Your new browser will probably ask whether you want to import your 
settings — including your bookmarks and favorites — from the browser pro­
gram you’ve been using. If you’ve already been using the Web for a while and 
have built up a list of your favorite Web sites (as described in Chapter 7), 
take advantage of this opportunity to copy your list into the new browser so 
that you don’t have to search for your favorite sites all over again.
The first time you run IE, it might run the Internet or New Connection Wizard, 
which offers to help you connect to the Internet. If it does, see Chapter 4 for 
details.
Hey, how about us Mac users?
Macs have always been famous for their slick, 
easy-to-use software, and the Internet soft­
ware is no exception. Macs come with a nice 
Web browser named Safari (refer to Figure 6-4). 
You use the Ô key rather than Ctrl for the key­
board shortcuts, and nearly all the rest of the 
keys work the way they do in the other brows­
ers we describe.
Or, you can do what we do and use Firefox, 
which works very nicely on a Mac, just like it 
does on Windows with Ô rather than Ctrl. You 
can use Safari to visit www.mozilla.com 
to download and install Firefox and then use it 
instead of or alongside Safari.

104
Part III: Web Mania 
Internet Explorer 8 asks whether you want to discover Web sites you might 
like based on sites you already have seen. You can turn the option on or off 
later by choosing Tools➪Suggested Sites. IE8 also asks whether to use its 
express (recommended) settings, which set your search site to Windows 
Live Search, set IE8 as your default browser, and turn on accelerators for 
Windows Live Web sites. Go ahead and accept these express settings. To 
change them later, choose Tools➪Options.

f you’ve read Chapter 6, you’re all set to browse the Web. But to be an 
efficient, downright clever Internaut, you need to know about some other 
browser features, such as printing Web pages, displaying more than one 
Web page at the same time, and storing the addresses of Web pages you like 
to visit often. You also need to know how to handle spyware, an Internet 
menace we describe in Chapter 2. This chapter is your guide to these extra 
features and how you can make the most of them right away.
Saving Stuff from the Web
Frequently, you see something on a Web page that’s worth saving for later. 
Sometimes it’s interesting information, a picture or some other type of file, or 
even the entire Web page. Fortunately, saving stuff is easy.
There’s not much point to saving an entire Web page. Web pages are usually 
made up of several files — one for the text, one for each picture, and some­
times other files, so your browser can’t just save the page in a file. However, 
you can save images and text from a page.
	
If you want to remember a page and come back to it, bookmark it in your 
browser, as explained later in this chapter.

106
Part III: Web Mania 
Saving text from a page
You can copy and paste text from a Web page into a word processing docu­
ment or another type of file. Select the text with your mouse (click and drag 
the mouse over the text) and press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac) to save the text 
in your computer’s clipboard. Then switch to the word processing or other 
program, position the cursor where you want the text to appear, and press 
Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to paste it. Easy enough!
Saving an image
To save an image you see on a Web page, follow these steps:
	
1.	Right-click the image.
	
2.	 Choose Save Image As (in Firefox or Chrome) or Save Picture As (in 
Internet Explorer) from the menu that appears.
	
3.	 In the Save Image or Save Picture dialog box, move to the folder or 
directory in which you want to save the graphics file, type a filename 
in the File Name text box, and click the Save button.
	
A note about copyright: Almost all Web pages, along with almost everything 
else on the Internet, are copyrighted by their authors. (A notable exception is 
U.S. federal government Web sites, which are all free of copyright.) If you save 
a Web page or a picture from a Web page, you don’t have permission to use it 
any way you want. Before you reuse the text or pictures, send an e-mail mes­
sage to the owner of the site. If an address doesn’t appear on the page, write 
for permission to webmaster@domain.com, replacing domain.com with the 
domain name part of the URL of the Web page.
Printing pages
To print a page, click the Print button on the toolbar, press Ctrl+P, or choose 
File➪Print (in Firefox only). The browser has to reformat the page to print, 
which can take a minute, so remember that patience is a virtue. Fortunately, 
each browser displays a progress window to let you know how it’s doing.
	
	 In Internet Explorer, click the down arrow to the right of the Print icon to 
choose Print (where you can select the printer), Print Preview (where you 
can see what you’re going to print before you waste paper printing the wrong 
thing), or Page Setup (where you can set margins). Firefox has the same com­
mands, but they’re on the File menu (choose File➪Print, File➪Print Preview, 
and File➪Page Setup).

107
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
	
	 In Chrome, you can click the Control the Current Page menu (just to the right 
of the Address box) to find the Print command.
	
If the page you want to print uses frames (a technique that divides the 
browser window into subareas that can scroll and update separately), click 
in the part of the window you want to print before printing. Otherwise, you 
might print only the outermost frame, which usually has just a title and some 
buttons.
Viewing Lots of Web Pages 
at the Same Time
When we’re pointing and clicking from one place to another, we like to open a 
bunch of browser windows so that we can see where we’ve been and go back 
to a previous page by just switching to another window. Or, your browser 
can display lots of Web pages in one window, by using tabs (as explained 
in the section “Tab dancing,” later in this chapter). You can also arrange 
windows side by side, which is a good way to, say, compare prices for The 
Internet For Dummies, 12th Edition (Wiley), at various online bookstores. (The 
difference may be small, but when you’re buying 100 copies for everyone on 
your Christmas list, those pennies can add up. Oh, you weren’t planning to 
do that? Drat.)
Wild window mania
To display a page in a new browser window, click a link with the right mouse 
button and choose Open in New Window (or Open Link in New Window) 
from the menu that pops up. To close a window, click the Close (X) button 
in the upper right corner of the window frame or press Alt+F4, the standard 
close-window shortcut. (On a Mac, click the red Close button in the upper left 
corner of the window.)
You can also create a new window without following a link: Press Ctrl+N. 
(Mac users should think “Alt” and “Apple” for “Ctrl.”)
Tab dancing
Firefox, Chrome, and IE have tabs, which are multiple pages that you can 
switch among in a window. (IE 6 and earlier versions don’t.) Figure 7-1 shows 
a Firefox window with three tabs. The names or addresses of the tabs are 
shown across the top of the browser window, below the browser’s menu and 
toolbars, like old-fashioned manila folder tabs.

108
Part III: Web Mania 
	
Figure 7-1: 
A Firefox 
window 
with three 
tabs.
	
Just click a tab to show the page. Press Ctrl+T to make a new, empty tab. 
Click the X on the tab to get rid of it. (In Chrome, right-click the tab and 
choose Delete from the menu that appears, or hover the mouse over the tab 
and click the X when it appears.)
As with multiple windows, you can have one tab loading in the background 
while you’re reading another tab, and little rotating arrows on the tab bar 
show you which ones are loading and which are ready. For most purposes, 
we find tabs more convenient than windows, but multiple windows are useful 
if you want to compare two Web pages side by side. You can use both tabs 
and windows; each window can have multiple tabs.
Short-attention-span tips
If you have a slow Internet connection, use at 
least two browser tabs or windows at the same 
time. While you’re waiting for the next page to 
open in one tab or window, you can read the 
page that opened a while ago in the other tab 
or window.
If you have your browser begin downloading a 
big file, it displays a small window in the corner 
of your screen. You can click back to the main 
browser window and continue surfing while the 
download continues.
Warning: Doing two or three things at a time in 
your browser when you have a slow Net con­
nection is not unlike squeezing blood from a 
turnip — only so much blood can be squeezed. 
In this case, the blood is the amount of data 
your computer can pump through your modem. 
A single download task can keep your Internet 
connection close to 100 percent busy, and any­
thing else you do shares the connection with 
the download process. When you do two things 
at a time, therefore, each one happens more 
slowly than it would by itself.

109
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
A Few of Your Favorite Things
You’ll find some Web pages that you want to visit over and over again. (We’ve 
both visited the Google Web site thousands of times by now.) The makers of fine 
browsers have, fortunately, provided a handy way for you to remember those 
URLs, so you don’t have to write them on the wall and type them again later.
The idea is simple: Your browser lets you add a Web address to a list on your 
computer. Later, when you want to go back, you just go to your list and pick 
the page you want. Firefox and Chrome call these saved Web addresses book­
marks; Internet Explorer calls them favorites.
Bookmarking with Firefox
Firefox has a Bookmarks choice on its menu where you can find all commands 
that relate to bookmarks. (That’s logical enough, we think.) To bookmark a 
Web page — that is, to add the address of the page to your bookmarks — 
choose Bookmarks➪Bookmark This Page or press Ctrl+D or drag the little icon 
at the left end of the Address box up to the Bookmarks menu item.
After you create a bookmark, it appears as an entry on the Bookmarks menu. 
To go to one of the pages on your bookmark list, just choose its entry from 
the menu.
If you’re like most users, your bookmark menu grows and grows and crawls 
down your screen and eventually ends up flopping on the floor, which is both 
unattractive and unsanitary. Fortunately, you can smoosh (technical term) 
your menu into a more tractable form. Choose View➪Sidebar➪Bookmarks 
(or press Ctrl+B) to display the Bookmarks sidebar down the left side of the 
Firefox window, as shown in Figure 7-2. Then you can move, edit, and delete 
your bookmarks.
You can go to any bookmarked page by clicking its bookmark in the Bookmarks 
sidebar. (You can leave this sidebar open while you move around the Web, or 
close it by clicking the X in its upper right corner.) You can also organize your 
bookmarks into folders and rename your bookmarks with meaningful names— 
Web page titles can be long and uninformative.
In the Bookmarks sidebar, click Bookmarks Menu to see the list of your 
bookmarks. If you want to organize your growing list of bookmarks into fold­
ers, right-click Bookmarks Menu and choose New Folder to add a submenu. 
After you create a folder, you can drag bookmarks and folders up and down 
to where you want them in the Bookmarks sidebar. Drag an item to a folder 
to put it in that folder’s submenu, and click a folder to display or hide that 
submenu. Because any changes you make in the Bookmarks sidebar are 
reflected immediately on the Bookmarks menu, you can easily fiddle with the 
bookmarks until you have them arranged as you like. Firefox starts out your 

110
Part III: Web Mania 
bookmarks with pages that the Firefox developers want you to look at, but 
feel free to delete those pages if your tastes are different from theirs.
	
Figure 7-2: 
Use the 
Bookmarks 
sidebar to

bookmarks.
	
Creating one-click bookmarks in Firefox
	
Okay, you’ve got the Bookmarks menu, which is what you see when you click 
Bookmarks on the menu at the top of the window. You’ve got the Bookmarks 
sidebar, described in the preceding section. Wait — there’s more! The 
Bookmarks toolbar is a row of buttons that usually appears just below the 
Address box. (If it isn’t there, choose View➪Toolbars➪Bookmarks Toolbar 
to display it.) This row of buttons gives you one-button access to a bunch of 
Firefox developers’ favorite Web sites. Wouldn’t it be nice if your favorite Web 
sites appeared there instead? No problem! When you organize your book­
marks in the Bookmarks sidebar, drag your favorite sites onto the Bookmarks 
Toolbar folder in the sidebar — any sites in this folder automagically appear 
on the Bookmarks toolbar. Feel free to delete the bookmarks that come with 
Firefox — the only one we like is the Latest Headlines bookmark, which dis­
plays a menu of breaking news stories on the BBC Web site.
Storing favorites with Internet Explorer
Internet Explorer uses a URL-saving system similar to the one in Firefox, 
although it calls the saved URLs favorites rather than bookmarks: You can 
add the current page to your Favorites folder and then look at and organize 
your Favorites folder. If you use Windows, this Favorites folder is shared with 

111
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
other programs on your computer. Other programs also can add things to 
your Favorites folder, so it’s a jumble of Web pages, files, and other elements. 
(To avoid insanity, most people use favorites only for Web pages.)
IE 8 has a Favorites icon — a gold star — just above the upper left corner of 
the Web page. To add the current page to your favorites, click the Favorites 
icon (or press Alt+C) and choose Add to Favorites from the menu that 
appears. The Add a Favorite dialog box, shown in Figure 7-3, displays the 
page name (which you can edit) and the folder in which the favorite will be 
saved. Click the Create In box to choose a folder, or click the New Folder 
button to make a new folder to contain the page’s address. Click Add when 
you’re ready to save the favorite.
	
Figure 7-3: 
Add a page 
to your IE 
favorites.
	
IE has a Favorites Explorer bar that looks like the Firefox Bookmarks sidebar, 
running down the left side of your browser window and showing you your 
favorites list. Click the Favorites icon (the gold star) to see the Favorites 
Explorer bar. Click a page name to display that page or click a folder to see 
(and click) the favorites that the folder contains.
If you want to reorganize your Favorites, just display the Favorites Explorer 
bar, click the down arrow to the right of Add to Favorites, and choose 
Organize Favorites. In the Organize Favorites window, shown in Figure 7-4, 
you can move favorites around, edit them, or delete them. To see what’s in a 
folder, click it. When you’re done organizing your favorite items, click Close.
Creating one-click bookmarks

	 Have you noticed the Favorites (formerly Links) toolbar, which usually 
appears just below the Address box, to the right of the Favorites icon? (If it 
isn’t there, click the Tools icon above the right corner of the Web page and 
choose Toolbars➪Favorites to display it.) You might never want to visit any 
of the sites that appear by default on this toolbar, but you can put your favor­
ite Web sites there instead. To add the current page to your Links toolbar, 
click the Add to Favorites Bar icon (a gold star with a green plus sign); an 
icon for the site appears on your toolbar. This feature is seriously handy for 
Web sites you visit often.

The Windows Live Toolbar
Windows Live Essentials is a bundle of free 
programs that Microsoft encourages Windows 
users to download. The “Windows Live 
Essentials” sidebar in Chapter 13 describes 
the whole package, but one of these programs 
affects how IE looks — the Windows Live 
Toolbar. After it’s installed (from download.
live.com), it appears just below the Address 
box. Some buttons require you to log in with 
your Windows Live ID, a free account you use 
to access various Microsoft services. The tool­
bar includes these cool boxes and buttons:
	✓	Live Search is a search box that uses the 
Microsoft Bing search site (described in 
Chapter 8).
	✓	What’s New shows your new Windows 
Live Hotmail messages and other news 
updates.
	✓	Profile opens the Microsoft attempt at a 
social networking site (described in Chapter 
18), and Share enables you to share book­
marks with people in your network.
	✓	Mail displays your Windows Live Hotmail 
account, if you use one (see Chapter 13).
	✓	Photos and Calendar offer a photo album 
site and a sharable online calendar (see 
Chapter 18).
	✓	Map the Addresses on This Page (the pin-
in-a-map icon) shows a list of addresses it 
finds on the page and can display a map of 
every address.
	✓	Translate This Page lets you choose a lan­
guage and provides a translation, which 
isn’t necessarily complete or totally cor­
rect, but gives you the general flavor.
If you decide that you don’t want to waste your 
valuable screen space on the Windows Live 
Toolbar, click the X at its left end and click 
Disable on the dialog box that appears.

113
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
When you organize your favorites, drag your favorite sites and folders into 
the Favorites Bar folder — any sites in this folder automagically appear on 
the Links toolbar. Delete any sites in the Favorites Bar folder that aren’t your 
favorites. You can also delete icons right from the Favorites toolbar; right-
click one and choose Delete from the menu that appears.
Bookmarking (including 
one-click) with Chrome
Google Chrome has a clean, spare look with no menus and only a few icons 
to clutter its window. But the features we love are still there, including book­
marks. To add the current page to your list of bookmarks, click the gold-star 
Bookmark This Page icon at the left end of the Address box. A Bookmark 
Added box pops up so that you can edit the name for the bookmark and 
choose which bookmark folder to put the Web page in. (Click Remove if you 
clicked this icon accidentally!)
	
	 To edit your bookmarks, click the Customize and Control icon, the little 
wrench to the right of the Address box, and choose Bookmark Manager from 
the menu that appears. Or, press Ctrl+Shift+B — but who can remember that? 
You see the Bookmark Manager, shown in Figure 7-5. Click Organize to add 
folders into which you can drag your bookmarks.
	
Figure 7-5: 
Chrome has 
bookmarks, 
too.
	
When you drag a bookmark into the Bookmarks Bar folder, it appears (where 
else?) on the Bookmarks bar, between the Address box and the top edge of 
the Web page in the Chrome window. (If you don’t see any bookmarks below 
the Address box, click the Customize and Control icon and choose Always 
Show Bookmarks Bar so that it has a check mark next to it.)

Part III: Web Mania 
Filling In Forms
The Web isn’t just for reading — it’s for buying stuff, signing up for stuff, and 
expressing your opinion about stuff. To put your two cents into a Web page, 
you usually fill out a form that has boxes to type in, check boxes to select, 
and maybe other clickable stuff. Then you click a Submit button (or a button 
with another name) to send in the information you entered. Figure 7-6 shows 
a typical form.
	
Figure 7-6: 
Just fill out 
a few forms.

Little boxes all the same
Text boxes in a form are white, fill-in boxes in which you type, in this case, 
your name and e-mail address. Check boxes are little square boxes in which 
you check whichever ones apply (all of them, we hope, on our sample form). 
Radio buttons, the little round buttons, are similar to check boxes except that 
you can choose only one of them from each set. In Figure 7-6 (refer to the pre­
ceding section), you also see a list box, in which you can choose one possibil­
ity in the box. In most cases, you see more entries than can fit in the box, so 
you scroll them up and down. You can usually choose only one entry, though 
some list boxes let you choose more.

115
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
Forms also include buttons that determine what happens to the informa­
tion you enter on the form. Most forms have two of these buttons: one that 
clears the form fields to their initial state and sends nothing, and one, usually 
known as the Submit button, that sends the filled-out form back to the Web 
server for processing.
Some Web pages have search boxes, which are one-line forms that let you 
type some text for which to search. Depending on the browser, a Submit 
button may be displayed to the right of the text area, or you may just press 
Enter to send the search words to the server. For example, the Google search 
page at www.google.com has a box in which you type a word or phrase; 
when you press Enter or click the Google Search button, the search begins. 
(See Chapter 8 to find out what happens!)
Remember the address!
Your browser can remember the entries, such as your name and address, 
that you frequently type into Web page forms. As you type, your browser 
may try to spot entries you made earlier and suggest the rest of the entry so 
that you don’t have to type it. If a suggestion pops up from your browser as 
you’re filling in a form, you can click the suggestion to accept it. If you don’t 
like the suggestion, just keep typing.
Your browser can keep a secret
When you fill out a form on a Web page, you 
may need to provide information that you prefer 
to keep private — your credit card number, for 
example. Not to worry! Browsers can encrypt 
the information you send to and receive from a 
secure Web server. You can tell when a page 
was received encrypted from the Web server 
by the little padlock icon at the right end of the 
Address box (in Chrome and IE) or in the lower 
right corner of the browser window (in Firefox). 
If the padlock doesn’t appear, the page wasn’t 
encrypted. To make it clearer, Chrome shows 
the whole Address box in yellow.
Typed-in data in forms on secure pages are 
almost always sent encrypted, making it impos­
sible for anyone to snoop on your secrets as 
they pass through the Net. Encrypted pages are 
nice, but in practice, it’s unlikely that anyone 
is snooping on your Web session anyway, 
encrypted or otherwise. The real security prob­
lems are elsewhere (refer to Chapter 2).
Firefox and Internet Explorer (IE) have the habit 
of popping up little boxes to warn you about 
the dangers of what you’re about to do. They 
display a box when you’re about to switch from 
encrypted to non-encrypted (or back again) 
transmissions. Most of these warning boxes 
include a check box you can select to tell the 
program not to bother you with this type of 
warning again. After you read the warning, 
select the check box so that your browser stops 
nagging you.

Part III: Web Mania 
Knowing Where to Start
When you run your browser, it displays your start page. Unfortunately, the 
people who make browsers usually don’t pick pages that we particularly like. 
Why not tell your browser to start where you want to start? You may want to 
start at the Yahoo! page (www.yahoo.com), which we describe in Chapter 6; 
or Google (www.google.com); or Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org for the 
English language encyclopedia); or the home page of your local newspaper. 
You can even start with more than one page by setting multiple start pages, 
and your browser can open each one in a separate tab.
	
	 You can also specify a separate home page, which is the page you see if you 
click the Home icon in your browser. Firefox and IE have a Home icon auto­
matically. If you use Chrome, you have to tell it to display a Home icon by 
clicking the Customize and Control wrench icon above the upper right corner 
of the Web page, choosing Options from the menu that appears, clicking the 
Basics tab if it’s not already selected, clicking the Show Home Button on the 
Toolbar check box so that it contains a check mark, and clicking Close.
The following sections show you how to set both your start page and your 
home page. Most people set them to the same page (or pages) anyway.
Specifying where Firefox starts
Display the page that you want to use as your start page and home, and then 
follow these steps.
	
1.	Choose Tools➪Options.
	
	 You see the Options dialog box, shown in Figure 7-7.
	
2.	Click the Main category icon, if it isn’t already selected.
	
	 This category may already be selected, and its settings appear in the 
rest of the Options dialog box. The settings you’re concerned with are in 
the Startup section.
	
3.	Set the When Firefox Starts option.
	
	 You can choose Show My Home Page (you set your home page in the 
next step), Show a Blank Page (make Firefox start faster), or Show My 
Windows and Tabs from Last Time.
	
4.	Set your home page(s) to the current page(s) by clicking (you guessed 
it!) the Use Current Pages button.
	
5.	Click OK.

 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
	
Figure 7-7: 
Set a 
favorite 
Web site as 
your start 
page in this 
dialog box.
	
	
You can set Firefox to display a bunch of pages when it starts up, each on 
its own, separate tab. For example, you might want to have Firefox open a 
weather-reporting page (such as Weather Underground at www.wunder
ground.com), The New York Times (www.nytimes.com), or even something 
silly (like cuteoverload.com), every time you start Firefox. First display the 
Web pages you want to start with. Then choose Tools➪Options, click Main, 
click Use Current Pages, and click OK.
Configuring Internet Explorer start 
and home pages
Display the page that you want to use as your start page and home page, and 
then follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Tools icon above the upper right corner of the Web page and 
choose Internet Options from the menu that appears.
	
	 You see the Internet Options dialog box, shown in Figure 7-8.
	
2.	Click the General tab, along the top of the dialog box.
	
	 It’s probably already selected, but we say this in case you’ve been look­
ing around at what’s on the other tabs.
	
3.	In the Home Page section, click the Use Current button.
	
	 The URL of the current page appears in the Address text box. To start 
with no page, click the Use Blank button.

4.	Click OK.
	
Figure 7-8: 
This dialog 
box controls 
which Web 
page to 
display on 
start-up.
	
IE also has a nifty command to add a page to your home set of tabs. Just 
above the top of the Web page, in the middle, is a Home icon. Click the down 
arrow to the right of the Home icon and choose Add or Change Home Page 
from the menu that appears. You can choose to use this page as your start 
page, or to add this page to the set of pages that IE displays when you start 
the program.
Telling Chrome what to display at start-up
Display the page that you want to use as your start page and home page, and 
then follow these steps:
	
1.	Click in the Address box and press Ctrl+C to copy the URL to your 
Clipboard.
	
	 You need to paste the address to set your home page. We consider this 
step to be dim design, and we’re hoping that by the time you read this 
section, the Chrome home page setup has been improved.
	
2.	Click the Customize and Control wrench icon above the upper right 
corner of the Web page and choose Options from the menu that 
appears.
	
	 You see the Google Chrome Options dialog box, shown in Figure 7-9.

119
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
	
3.	In the On Startup section, choose Open the Home Page, Restore the 
Pages That Were Open Last, or Open the Following Pages.
	
	 If you choose the last option, you can click Use Current to set the cur­
rent page as your start page (or one of several start pages, using tabs).
	
4.	Set your home page to the current page by choosing Open This Page, 
clicking in the box to its right, and pressing Ctrl+V to paste the URL 
from Step 1 into this box.
	
	 Wouldn’t you think that Chrome would have a Use Current button here? 
Maybe soon.
	
5.	Click Close.
	
Figure 7-9: 
Chrome 
options 
include 
setting your 
start-up 
page.
	
	
You might consider setting your home page to what Chrome calls its New Tab 
page. This page is pretty cool, actually — Chrome displays a bunch of tiny page 
pages, like thumbnail pictures of the pages, each with a title, showing the pages 
you’ve visited most often. It also shows bookmarks you’ve recently used and 
pages you’ve recently closed. Very useful! That’s the home page we use.

Part III: Web Mania 
Who Can Remember All 
Those Passwords?
Not us. Many Web sites ask you to enter a username and password. If you’re 
buying something from an online store like Amazon.com, you create an 
account with a username and password that you enter every time you want 
to buy something. Amazon.com remembers your name, address, and credit 
card information as part of your account, so you don’t need to enter it every 
time. If you want to read The New York Times online at www.nytimes.com, 
you create an account with a password, too. The account remembers what 
kinds of news you’re interested in reading. After you use the Web for a while, 
you pile up a heap of usernames and passwords.
	
See the sidebar “What’s the secret word, Mr. Potter?” in Chapter 2 for advice 
on choosing passwords and keeping track of them safely.
Web browsers offer to remember your usernames and passwords for you. Using 
this feature can be dangerous if other people use your computer or if you use a 
computer in a public place, like a library or an Internet café. But if you’re the only 
person who uses your computer, you may want to let your browser do the work 
of remembering some, if not all, of your usernames and passwords.
When you see a Web page that asks for a username and password, your browser 
may pop up a little window that offers to remember the username and password 
you enter, similar to Figure 7-10. If you click Yes, the next time you arrive at the 
same page, your browser may fill in your username and password for you.
	
Figure 7-10: 
Storing 
passwords 
in your 
browser.
	
	
Depending on who else has access to your computer, you might let your 
browser remember only passwords to accounts that don’t involve spending 
money or revealing personal information. For example, if we have an account 
at a Harry Potter fan site that enables us to participate in online discussions, 
the danger of having someone break into this account is a lot less daunting 
than the thought of someone hacking into an online bank account. Unless your 
computer is in a physically secure place, don’t let your browser remember 
passwords that have any real power.

121
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
Storing passwords in Firefox
You can control whether and how your browser stores these passwords. In 
Firefox, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Tools➪Options.
	
	 You see the Options dialog box, with a list of the categories of options 
across the top (refer to Figure 7-7).
	
2.	Click the Security category and look in the Passwords section.
	
3.	Set the Remember Passwords for Sites check box.
	
	 Click it to clear the check mark if you want to turn off this feature (or 
click it again to turn it back on).
	
4.	If you want to see the list of usernames that Firefox has saved, click 
the Saved Passwords button.
	
	 You can review or delete usernames that Firefox is remembering for 
you. You can’t see the passwords, but if you delete a username, the 
password goes, too. Click Close when you’re done.
	
5.	Select the Use a Master Password check box to set a master password that 
you need to type only once, at the beginning of each Firefox session.
	
	 This option reduces the number of passwords you need to remember 
while maintaining some security.
	
6.	Click OK to close the Options dialog box.
Storing passwords in IE
In Internet Explorer, remembering usernames and passwords is the job of the 
AutoComplete feature, which you set up by following these simple steps:
	
1.	Choose Tools➪Internet Options.
	
	 You see the Internet Options dialog box (refer to Figure 7-8).
	
2.	Click the Content tab.
	
3.	In the AutoComplete section, click the Settings button.
	
	 You see the AutoComplete Settings dialog box.
	
4.	Click the check boxes to control which kinds of entries IE stores.
	
	 IE doesn’t show you a list of the passwords you saved, but you can turn 
the feature on and off by selecting the Ask Me Before Saving Passwords 
check box. The User Names and Passwords On Forms check box con­
trols whether IE fills in your stored passwords on forms.

122
Part III: Web Mania 
	
5.	Click OK to close the AutoComplete Settings dialog box, and click OK 
again to close the Internet Options dialog box.
Storing passwords in Chrome
The Chrome settings for remembering passwords are more like those in 
Firefox. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Customize and Control wrench icon and choose Options 
from the menu that appears.
	
	 You see the Google Chrome Options dialog box (refer to Figure 7-9).
	
2.	Click the Personal Stuff tab.
	
3.	In the Passwords section, click Offer to Save Passwords or Never Save 
Passwords.
	
4.	If you want to review the passwords that Chrome has already saved, 
click Show Saved Passwords.
	
	 You can’t see the passwords, just the usernames, and you can remove 
any you don’t want saved. Click Close when you’re done.
	
5.	Click Close.
Cookies Are (Usually) Your Friends
To enhance your online experience, browser makers invented a type of spe­
cial message that lets a Web site recognize you when you revisit that site. 
They thoughtfully store this info, called a cookie, on your very own machine. 
See the section “Cookies aren’t so bad” in Chapter 2 for a full description of 
cookies and how they compare to more serious security threats. You can 
control which sites can store cookies on your computer.
Usually, the Web site that sets a cookie is the only one that reads the cookie. 
However, third-party cookies can be set by one Web site and read by another. 
Third-party cookies are used by servers that deliver advertisements and 
those annoying pop-up and pop-under ads. We recommend that you accept 
most cookies but block third-party cookies.
Burning cookies in Firefox
Choose Tools➪Options, click the Privacy category, and look in the History 
section. If Remember History is selected, Firefox stores cookies. If you 
want more control over what it stores, change it to Use Custom Settings for 
History. This setting displays these cookie-related check boxes:

123
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
	
✓	Accept Cookies from Sites: We recommend that you leave this one 
selected.
	
✓	Accept Third-Party Cookies: Click this one to remove its check mark.
You can specify which sites can and cannot store cookies by clicking the 
Exceptions button. You can enter the Web addresses that you definitely trust 
with cookies (like the shopping sites you frequent) or that you don’t trust 
(like advertising sites).
You can take a look at the cookies on your computer, too. Click the Show 
Cookies button and scroll down the list of sites. If you see one that you don’t rec­
ognize or that sounds suspicious, click it and click the Remove Cookies button.
Exploring cookies in IE
Choose Tools➪Internet Options and click the Privacy tab. IE displays a slider 
that you can drag up and down to increase or decrease your level of privacy. 
By default, Internet Explorer sets your privacy level to Medium, allowing 
cookies except for third-party cookies. If you want to specify exactly how 
cookies are saved, click the Advanced button to see the Advanced Privacy 
Settings dialog box and then select the Override Automatic Cookie Handling 
check box. The options are
	
✓	First-Party Cookies: You can choose to accept or to block or to be 
prompted to choose, although this option gets tiresome quickly if you 
encounter a lot of cookies. Some sites can store three or more cookies 
per page. Choose Accept.
	
✓	Third-Party Cookies: Just say no to (that is, choose Block) third-party 
cookies.
	
✓	Always Allow Session Cookies: This check box lets through all session 
cookies, a type of cookie used to track a single instance of your visit to a 
Web site. These cookies are commonly used by shopping sites such as 
Amazon.com and are harmless. Select this option so that it contains a 
check mark.
Cookies and Chrome
Click the Customize and Control wrench icon, choose Options from the menu 
that appears, and click the Under the Hood tab in the Google Chrome Options 
dialog box that appears. Select the cookie setting labeled Restrict How Third-
Party Cookies Can Be Used. (In our humble opinion, it’s your best bet.)
If you want to see which cookies are stored on your computer, click the Show 
Cookies button to display the Cookies dialog box. You can see the Web sites 

124
Part III: Web Mania 
that set the cookies, the names of the cookies, and their contents. (Most are 
boring.) If you don’t like the looks of a cookie, click it and then click Remove.
Where Have You Been?
Browsers keep a history list of the Web sites you’ve been to. No, your browser 
isn’t spying on you; the history list remembers pages you went to earlier, 
even days ago, so that you can find them again. You can see your history list, 
and return to any page on it by clicking it. Here’s how:
	
✓	Firefox: The History command on the menu displays where you’ve been. 
You can also press Ctrl+H to display the list down the left side of your 
browser window, arranged by day. Close the history list by clicking the 
X in its upper right corner.
	
✓	Internet Explorer: The history list is associated with the Back and 
Forward buttons. Click the down arrow between the Forward button (the 
white, right-arrow icon) and the Address box, and IE displays the pages 
you’ve been to recently. You can choose History from the end of the list 
to display your history list down the left side of your browser window.
	
✓	Chrome: Click and hold the Back button and choose Show Full History 
from the menu that appears, or press Ctrl+H. You see a list of Web pages 
by day, with the time you viewed each page.
Oh, nowhere, really
Some of our readers have asked us how to clear out their browsing, presum­
ably because they meant to type www.disney.com but their fingers slipped 
and it came out www.hot-xxx-babes.com instead. (It could happen to 
anyone.) Because some of the requests sounded fairly urgent, here are the 
gruesome details:
	
✓	Firefox: Choose Tools➪Clear Recent History. Choose how far back to 
forget (the default is the last hour) and click Clear Now.
	
✓	Internet Explorer: Click Safety (above the upper right corner of the Web 
page) and choose Delete Browsing History from the menu that appears. 
(Hmm, it’s right at the top. There must be a lot of sloppy typists out 
there.) In the Delete Browsing History dialog box, clear all check boxes 
except the History check box (by clicking each one) and click Delete.
	
✓	Chrome: The history list (displayed by pressing Ctrl+H) is sorted by 
day, and next to each date is a Delete History for This Day link.

125
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
Your browsing is nobody else’s business
	
If you’re using someone else’s computer, and especially if you’re using a 
public computer in a library or Internet café, you should delete your browsing 
history and any other information about your session that might be stored on 
the computer. Otherwise, the next person to sit down at the computer might 
find your browsing history rather interesting, especially if the browser has 
thoughtfully stored the usernames and password you entered.
Here’s how to delete your browsing information (history, cookies, and stored 
passwords):
	
✓	Firefox: Choose Tools➪Clear Recent History, set the time range to 
Everything, and click Clear Now.
	
✓	IE: You can use InPrivate Browsing, by clicking Safety and choosing 
InPrivate Browsing. If you forgot to do that when you started browsing, 
choose Safety➪Delete Browsing History, select all the check boxes, and 
click Delete.
	
✓	Chrome: You can browse incognito. (Don’t forget your trench coat and 
fedora.) Click the Customize and Control wrench icon and choose New 
Incognito Window. Or, you can right-click any link or bookmark and 
choose Open Link in Incognito Window. If you forgot to go incognito, 
you can click the Customize and Control wrench icon, choose Clear 
Browsing Data, select all the check boxes, set the period to Everything, 
and click Clear Browsing Data.
Blocking Pop-Up Windows
Pop-up windows, as described in Chapter 2, are browser windows that open with­
out your asking for them, usually at the command of the Web site you’re viewing. 
Some Web sites display so many pop-ups that your computer becomes unusable 
until you can close them all. If you’ve encountered these sites, you’ll be glad to 
hear that your browser can block most (though not all) pop-up windows.
No pop-ups in Firefox
In Firefox, choose Tools➪Options to open the Options window and click the 
Content category, and you’ll see the Block Pop-up Windows check box. We 
leave it selected.
Blocking all pop-ups makes a few Web sites stop working. In particular, some 
shopping sites pop up small windows in which you have to type credit card 
verification information. Online help sometimes appears in pop-ups, too. 

126
Part III: Web Mania 
Firefox thoughtfully includes an Exception button that lets you specify Web 
sites whose pop-ups are okay with you.
When a Web site tries to display a pop-up, you see at the top of the Web page 
a message saying “Firefox prevented this site from opening a popup window.” 
Click the Options button and choose from the menu that appears:
	
✓	Allow Popups from Sitename puts this site on your Allowed list.
	
✓	Enable Popup Blocker Options displays the Allowed Sites dialog box so 
that you can edit your list of sites.
	
✓	Don’t Show This Message When Popups Are Blocked continues to 
block pop-ups, without asking every time it blocks one.
Click the red X at the right end of the message to make the message go away.
Blocking pop-ups in Internet Explorer
Microsoft finally added a pop-up blocker in response to the growing popular­
ity of Firefox. Choose Tools➪Pop-up Blocker to turn this feature off or back 
on. (We leave ours on.)
The IE pop-up blocker displays a “Pop-up blocked” message at the top of the 
Web page whenever it blocks a pop-up window, and clicking the message dis­
plays a similar set of options. You can tweak your pop-up blocking options at 
any time by choosing Tools➪Pop-Up Blocker➪Pop-Up Blocker Settings.
Chrome and pop-ups
Chrome includes a pop-up blocker, too. When it blocks a pop-up, you see a 
message in the lower right corner of the browser window. You can click the 
message and then choose the first option (the exact address of the pop-up) 
to display it, or choose Always Allow Popups to allow pop-ups from the site.
When Browsers Go Bad
	
If your browser looks odd, try these tricks:
	
✓	If the Web page looks garbled, click the Reload or Refresh icon (the 
circular arrow) to load the page again. Maybe it was damaged during its 
arduous trek across the Net.
	
✓	If the whole top of the window is gone — you have no window title bar 
or menu bar — you’re in Full Screen mode. Press F11 to return to normal.

127
 Chapter 7: Taking Your Browser for a Spin
	
✓	If the browser restarted and is telling you which fabulous new fea­
tures it now has, it probably just downloaded an updated version of the 
program and had to restart itself to complete the installation. Read the 
message appreciatively and then close the tab or window.
	
✓	If some of your toolbars are missing, you may need to give a command 
to bring them back. In Firefox, choose View➪Toolbars; if a check mark 
doesn’t appear to the left of one of the toolbars, choose the toolbar to 
put a check mark back in front of it and to redisplay that window compo­
nent. In IE, choose Tools➪Toolbars.
	
✓	If the buttons on your toolbar aren’t the buttons you’re used to, some 
helpful person (or interfering busybody) may have changed them when you 
weren’t looking. In Firefox, right-click a blank place on the toolbar or menu 
bar, choose Customize from the menu that appears, click Restore Default 
Set, and click Done. In IE, right-click a blank place on the toolbar, choose 
Customize➪Add or Remove Commands, click Reset, and click Close.
	
✓	If the menu bar is missing in IE — no File-Edit-View set of commands that 
you’re probably used to, then hear this: Microsoft is abolishing the menu 
bar in all its programs. However, you can display it temporarily by press­
ing the Alt key. Or, put it back for good by right-clicking a blank place on 
the toolbar and choosing Menu Bar from the menu that appears.
	
✓	If your browser is just acting weird, close all your browser windows, 
take a few deep breaths, and run your browser again. If the situation is 
ugly, try restarting the computer. (Save any unsaved work first.)
	
✓	If your browser, particularly IE, still looks strange, especially if it’s 
showing a lot of ads that you didn’t ask for, your computer is probably 
infected with spyware. See Chapter 2 for a definition of spyware, and see 
the section in Chapter 4 about detecting spyware for advice on getting 
rid of it.
Getting Plugged In with Plug-Ins
Web pages with text and pictures are old hat. Now, Web pages have to have 
pictures that sing and dance or ticker-style messages that move across the 
page, or they have to be able to play a good game of chess with you. Every 
month, new types of information appear on the Web, and browsers have to 
keep up. You can extend your browser’s capabilities with plug-ins — add-on 
programs that glue themselves to the browser and add even more features. 
Internet Explorer can also extend itself by using ActiveX controls, which are 
another (less secure) type of add-on program.
What are you to do when your browser encounters new kinds of information on 
a Web page? Get the plug-in program that handles that kind of information and 
glue it to the browser program. Star Trek fans can think of plug-ins as parasitic 
life forms that attach themselves to your browser and enhance its intelligence.

128
Part III: Web Mania 
When you restart Firefox, maybe because it updated itself, it may display the 
Add-Ons window, showing a list of installed add-ons. (You can display this 
window at any time by choosing Tools➪Add-ons.) You can click Find Updates 
to update any add-on for which there’s a newer version on the Web.
Two essential plug-ins
Here are just two useful plug-ins you may want to add to your browser:
	
✓	Flash Player: Plays both audio and video files in addition to other types 
of animations. Widely used on Web pages, it’s available at adobe.
com/products/flashplayer. Using Flash, you can view videos on 
YouTube (see Chapter 9). Flash can also play streaming sound and video 
files while you download them. Our favorite site with streaming audio 
is the National Public Radio Web site (www.npr.org), where you can 
hear recent NPR radio stories. Another favorite is the BBC at www.bbc.
co.uk with news in 43 languages (really) and other BBC programs 24 
hours a day.
	
✓	Adobe Acrobat: Displays Acrobat files formatted exactly the way the 
author intended. Lots of useful Acrobat files are out there, including 
many U.S. tax forms (at www.irs.ustreas.gov). You can find Acrobat 
at get.adobe.com/reader.
How to use plug-ins
After you download a plug-in from the Net, run it (double-click its icon or 
filename) to install it. Depending on what the plug-in does, you follow differ­
ent steps to try it out — usually, you find a file that the plug-in can play and 
watch (or listen) as the plug-in plays it.
After you install the plug-in, you don’t have to do anything to run it. It fires 
up automatically whenever you view a Web page containing information that 
requires the plug-in.
	
To confuse matters, Firefox also allows you to install add-in programs writ­
ten in its own, special extension language. Go to addons.mozilla.org/
firefox to find out more about them. Popular add-ons include programs to 
display maps or weather forecasts, see the inner workings of Firefox, or see 
price comparisons from other Web sites.

“O
kay, all this great stuff is out there on the Internet. How do I find 
it?” That’s an excellent question and thanks for asking. Questions 
like that one are what make this country strong and vibrant. We salute you 
and say, “Keep asking questions!” Next question, please.
Oh, you want an answer to your question. Fortunately, quite a bit of (techni­
cal term follows) stuff-finding stuff is on the Web. More particularly, free ser­
vices known as search engines and directories are available that cover most of 
the interesting material on the Web. There’s even a free encyclopedia, writ­
ten by Internet users like you.
You can search in dozens or hundreds of different ways, depending on what 
you’re looking for and how you prefer to search. Search can take some practice 
because billions of Web pages are lurking out on the Net, most of which have 
nothing to do with the topic you’re looking for. (John has remarked that his 
ideal restaurant has only one item on the menu, but it’s exactly what he wants. 
The Internet is about as far from that ideal as you can possibly imagine.)

130
Part III: Web Mania 
To provide a smidgen of structure to this discussion, we describe several 
different sorts of searches:
	
✓	Built-in searches: Topic searches that a browser does automatically, 
and why we’re not always thrilled about it
	
✓	Goods and services: Stuff to buy or find out about, from mortgages to 
mouthwash
	
✓	People: Actual human beings whom you may want to contact, find out 
more about, or spy on
	
✓	Topics: Places, things, ideas, companies — anything you want to find 
out more about
To find topics, we use the various online search engines and directories, 
such as Google and Yahoo!. To find people, however, we use directories of 
people — and those are (fortunately) different from directories of Web pages. 
If you’re wondering what we’re talking about, read on!
Search engine, directory — what’s the difference?
When we talk about a directory, we mean a 
listing like an encyclopedia or a library’s card 
catalog. (Well, like the computer system that 
replaced the card catalog.) A directory has 
named categories with entries assigned to 
them partly or entirely by human catalogers. 
You look up categories by finding one you want 
and seeing what it contains.
A search engine, on the other hand, periodically 
looks at every page it can find on the Internet, 
extracts keywords from them (all words except 
for and, the, and the like), and makes a big list. 
(Yes, it takes a lot of computers. Google has 
several hundred thousand of them.) The search 
engine then tries to figure out which pages 
are most important, using factors such as how 
many other sites link to that page, and gives 
each page a score. You use the search engine 
by specifying some words that seem likely, and 
it finds all entries that contain that word, rank­
ing them by their score.
We think of the index in the back of the book 
as a hard-copy equivalent of a search engine; 
it has its advantages and disadvantages, as 
do directories, which are more like this book’s 
table of contents. Directories are organized 
better, but search engines are easier to use 
and more comprehensive. Directories use con­
sistent terminology, and search engines use 
whichever terms the underlying Web pages 
use. Directories contain fewer useless pages, 
but search engines are updated more often.
Some overlap exists between search engines 
and directories — Yahoo! includes a directory 
and a search engine; Google, which is mainly a 
search engine, includes a version of the Open 
Directory Project (ODP) directory.

Your Basic Search Strategy
When we look for topics on the Net, we always begin with a search engine, 
usually Google. (The word google has now been “verbed,” much to the 
dismay of the Google trademark lawyers.)
You use all search engines in more or less the same way:
	
1.	Start your Web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Internet 
Explorer.
	
	 Flip to Chapter 6 if you don’t know what a browser is.
	
2.	Go to your favorite search engine’s home page.
	
	 You can try one of these URLs (Web addresses): www.google.com, 
www.yahoo.com, or www.bing.com. We list the URLs of other search 
sites later in this section.
	
	 Or, just click in the Search box in the upper right corner of your browser 
window, to the right of the Address box.
	
3.	Type some likely keywords in the Search box (either your browser’s 
search box or the search box that appears on the search engine’s 
home page) and press Enter.
	
	 After a delay (usually brief, but after all, the Web is big), the search 
engine returns a page with some links to pages that it thinks match your 
keywords. The full list of links that match your keywords may be way 
too long to deal with — say, 300,000 of them — but the search engine 
tries to put them in a reasonable order and lets you look at them a 
screenful at a time.
	
4.	Adjust and repeat your search until you find something you like.
	
	 One trick is to pick keywords that relate to your topic from two or three 
different directions, such as ethopian restaurants trumansburg 
or war women song. Think of words that would be on a page contain­
ing the information you want. After some clicking around to get the hang 
of it, you find all sorts of good stuff.
	
5.	If the search engine is producing results too scattered to be useful and 
you can’t think of any better keywords, try Yahoo! Directory at dir.
yahoo.com or Google Directory at www.google.com/dirhp.
	
	 When you see a list of links to topic areas, click a topic area of inter­
est. In the directory approach, you begin at a general topic and become 
more and more specific. Each page has links to pages that become 
increasingly specific until they link to actual pages that are likely to be 
of interest.

Part III: Web Mania 
Search, Ho!
Once upon a time in an Internet far, far away, lots of search engines and direc­
tories battled with each other to see which would be the favorite. Participants 
were AltaVista and Dogpile and lots of other sites you can find in earlier edi­
tions of this book. Well, it seems that the first pangalactic search war is pretty 
much over, with Google and Yahoo! the victors — at least for now. However, 
Microsoft is trying to mount a new campaign with its Bing search engine. Visit 
net.gurus.org/search for all the exciting developments.
Google, our favorite search engine
Our favorite Web search engine is Google. It has little (software) robots that 
spend their time merrily visiting Web pages all over the Net and reporting 
what they see. It makes a humongous index of which words occurred in 
which pages; when you search for something, it picks pages from the index 
that contain the words you asked for. Google uses a sophisticated ranking 
system, based on how many other Web sites refer to each page in the index. 
Usually, the Google ranking puts the best pages first.
The lazy searcher’s search page
You may feel a wee bit overwhelmed by all 
the search directories and search engines we 
discuss in this chapter. If it makes you feel any 
better, so do we.
To make a little sense of all this stuff, we made 
ourselves a search page that connects to all the 
directories and search engines we use — call it 
one-stop searching. You can use it, too. Give it a 
try at net.gurus.org/search.
In the not unlikely event that new search sys­
tems are created or some existing ones have 
moved or died, this page gives you our latest 
greatest list and lets you sign up for e-mailed 
updates whenever we change it.
The number-one reason a search doesn’t find anything
Well, it may not be your number-one reason, but 
it’s our number-one reason: A search word is 
spelled wrong or mistyped. John notes that his 
fingers insist on typing Interent, which doesn’t 
find much — other than Web pages from 
other people who can’t spell or type. Google 
often catches spelling mistakes and helpfully 
suggests alternatives. We sometimes use a 
Google search to check the preferred spelling 
of words that haven’t made it into the dictionary 
yet. (Thanks to our friend Jean Armour Polly, for 
reminding us about this problem.)

133
 Chapter 8: Needles and Haystacks: Finding Almost Anything on the Web
Refining your search
Using Google or any other search engine is an exercise in remote-control 
mind reading. You have to guess words that will appear on the pages you’re 
looking for. Sometimes, that’s easy — if you’re looking for recipes for Key 
lime pie, key lime pie is a good set of search words because you know 
the name of what you’re looking for. On the other hand, if you have forgotten 
that the capital of France is Paris, it’s sometimes hard to tease a useful page 
out of a search engine because you don’t know which words to look for. (If 
you try France capital, some search engines show you info about invest­
ment banking and Fort de France, which is the capital of the French overseas 
départment of Martinique. Many people must ask this question, because 
Google takes pity on you and tells you at the top: “Capital: Paris.”)
Now that we have you all discouraged, try some Google searches. Direct your 
browser to www.google.com. You see a screen like the one shown in Figure 8-1.
	
Figure 8-1: 
Google, 
classic 
style. (It was 
Galileo’s 
birthday.)
	
Type some search terms, and Google finds the pages that best match your 
terms. That’s “best match,” not “match” — if it can’t match all the terms, it 
finds pages that match as well as possible. Google ignores words that occur 
too often to be usable as index terms, both the obvious (ones such as and, 
the, and of) and merely routine (terms such as internet and mail). These 
rules can sound somewhat discouraging, but in fact it’s still not hard to get 

134
Part III: Web Mania 
useful results from Google. You just have to think up good search terms. Try 
that recipe example by typing key lime pie and clicking the Search button. 
You see a response like the one shown in Figure 8-2.
Your results won’t look exactly like the ones shown in Figure 8-2 because 
Google will have updated its database since this book was published. Most of 
the pages that Google found do, in fact, have something to do with Key lime 
pie — some have good recipes. Google says it found 871,000 matches (yow!), 
but in the interest of sanity it shows you about 100 of them, 10 at a time. 
Although that’s still probably more than you want to look at, you should at 
least look at the next couple of screens of matches if the first screen doesn’t 
have what you want. Because the list includes a lot of restaurants with Key 
lime pie on the menu and a hair salon named Key Lime Pie, you can just 
narrow the search by adding the keyword recipe. Search engines are dumb; 
you have to add the intelligence. At the bottom of the Google screen are page 
numbers; click Next to go to the next page.
	
Figure 8-2: 
Plenty of 
pages of 
pie.
	
The links in the right column and sometimes at the top of the results are “spon­
sored” links — that is, paid ads, ranked by how much the advertiser was will­
ing to pay. Often, they’re worth clicking, but remember that they’re ads.
The I’m Feeling Lucky button searches and takes you directly to the first link, 
which works, well, when you’re lucky.

Even more Google options
Although Google looks very simple, it has plenty of other options that can be 
handy. You can
	
✓	Get there from here. Type a street address, and Google offers a link to a 
map. Type a person’s name and a full or partial address, at least the state 
abbreviation, and Google gives you addresses and phone numbers. Type 
a phone number, and it often gives you the name and address. (Try typing 
202-456-1414). The information is all collected from public sources, but if 
you find this process a bit too creepy, look yourself up and if it finds you, 
it includes a link to a page where you can have your info removed.
	
✓	Search Usenet for information. Usenet is the giant collection of Internet 
newsgroups (online discussion groups) that has been around since before 
the Web. Simply click the Groups link above the Google search box. If a 
topic has been discussed in the past 28 years on Usenet (as it seems most 
topics have), this technique is the best way to find the messages about 
that topic. It’s a useful place to find out how to fix computer problems — 
most likely, whatever question you have has been asked and answered on 
Usenet, and Google has all of it. (John found things there that he wrote in 
1981.) To browse around Usenet newsgroups, start at groups.google.
com. For a description of Usenet, see net.gurus.org/usenet.
	
✓	Search for images and videos as well as for text. Often, Google shows 
some relevant images or videos at the bottom of its search results. You 
can click any of them, or to see more images or videos, just click the 
Image or Videos links at the top of any Google search page. Google has 
no idea what each image or video is but looks at the surrounding text 
and the filename of the image or video and does a remarkably good job 
of guessing. If you search for a key lime pie image, you indeed see dozens 
Handy search engine targeting tips
Google makes it easy to refine your search even 
more specifically to target the pages you want 
to find. After each search, your search terms 
appear in a box at the top of the page so that you 
can change them and try again. Here are some 
tips on how you may want to change your terms:
	✓	If two or more words should appear 
together, put quotes around them, as in 
“Elvis Presley”. You should do 
that with the pie search (“key lime pie”) 
because, after all, that’s the pie’s name, 
although in this example, Google is clever 
enough to realize that it’s a common phrase 
and pretends that you typed the quotes 
anyway.
	✓	Use + and – to indicate words that must 
either appear or not appear, such as 
+Elvis +Costello -Presley if 
you’re looking for the modern Elvis, not the 
classic one.
	✓	Capitalization doesn’t matter. We use all 
lowercase for our search terms.

136
Part III: Web Mania 
of pictures of tasty pies, and a video search finds a lot of pie-preparation 
videos. The SafeSearch feature omits pictures of naked people and the 
like. If you turn it off, you can find some impressively unsafe pictures.
	
✓	Read the news. Google News (click the News link or start at news.
google.com) shows a summary of current online news culled automati­
cally from thousands of sources all over the world. Warning: If you’re 
interested in current events, you can easily waste 12 hours a day follow­
ing links from here.
	
✓	Limit your search to documents in a specific language. There’s no sense 
in finding pages in a language you can’t read, although Google has a subsys­
tem that can try, with mixed success, to translate pages from certain other 
languages. Click the Language Tools link to the right of the search box.
	
✓	Do painless arithmetic. Google is even a calculator. Type 2+2 and Google 
says 2 + 2 = 4. It knows units, so if you type 4 feet 8.5 inches, Google says 
4 feet 8.5 inches = 1.4351 meters. It can also convert currencies.
Searching from your cellphone
Google isn’t limited to the Internet; you can use it from any phone that can send 
and receive text messages. Google has a special five-digit phone number — 
46645 (GOOGL) — that you can text from any phone that can send and receive 
text messages. Here’s how:
	
1.	Compose a text message to the phone number 46645 (GOOGL).
	
2.	In the text of the message, type a Google search command.
	
	 Here are some search commands you can use:
 
• For driving directions, type the two addresses separated by to. For 
example, type 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC to 1 Fifth 
Avenue, New York, NY.
 
• For nearby restaurants, type the name or type of restaurant fol­
lowed by the city and state or the zip code. For example, type 
pizza Middlebury VT.
 
• For movie times, type the name of the movie followed by the city 
and state or zip code.
 
• For help with other commands you can use, type help.
	
3.	Send the message.
	
	 Within a few minutes, you receive a text message back from Google with 
the results of your search.
See Google SMS, at sms.google.com, for more information. If your phone 
has a Web browser, you can use Google from it, too, the same way you visit 
any other Web page.

Bing!
Microsoft never cedes any part of the computer business without a struggle 
to the death, and Web search is no exception. After many false starts over 
many years, its new Bing search engine, shown in Figure 8-3, shows promise. 
Its basic operation is a lot like Google: You type some search terms and it 
finds you some Web pages. If you would rather see images or videos, look at 
the clickable Images and Videos links at the top of the page, just like Google. 
If you want maps and satellite images, use the Maps link, just like the one at 
Google. If you’re looking for news stories, well, you get the idea. If imitation is 
the sincerest form of flattery, Google must be feeling extremely flattered.
	
Figure 8-3: 
Bing, ready 
to go, with 
a bonus 
geography 
lesson.
	
Bing isn’t exactly the same as Google. In most cases in its results, it suggests 
related searches you might want to try. The video search runs previews of 
the videos it found if you mouse over any of them, which is kind of cute. Its 
satellite images are different from Google’s, so you might see a clearer view 
in one than the other. Overall, we don’t find any overwhelming reason to 
prefer Bing, but it’s worth a look.
A significant difference in Bing is that Microsoft has made it easy to embed Bing 
searches into other Web sites, including a split of the money from any ads in the 
search results, so you can expect to find Bing lurking in lots of places on the Net.

Part III: Web Mania 
Browsing with Directories
Sometimes a Web search just doesn’t find what you’re looking for. Coming up 
with the right search terms can be tricky if no specific word or phrase sums up 
what you want to know. This is the moment to try a Web directory. If you know 
in general but not in detail what you’re looking for, clicking up and down through 
directory pages is a good way to narrow your search and find pages of interest.
Yahoo for directories!
Yahoo! (yes, the exclamation point is part of its name) is one of the oldest 
directories — and still a good one. Search for entries or click from category to 
category until you find something you like. Start at dir.yahoo.com. (At least 
Google does more than search
Here are a bunch of other Web-based services 
that Google offers. (As far as we can tell, all 
these services are part of the Google Grand 
Plan for Global Domination, but the services are 
free and good, so we use them.)
You can find files fast on your own computer. 
Google offers Google Desktop, a program 
you can download to your PC that lets you do 
Google-like searches (while viewing Google-
like ads) of the contents of your PC’s hard drive. 
We find Google Desktop particularly useful for 
finding old files and e-mail messages that we’re 
convinced are somewhere on our computers. 
Download it from desktop.google.com.
You can see a map of almost anywhere. At 
Google Maps, you type an address and see a map 
of the area or a satellite photo of the same area 
or both superimposed. Try it at maps.google.
com. Or, if you’re tired of hearing about Google 
all the time, try MapQuest, at www.mapquest.
com, another excellent map site. Even cooler is 
Google Earth (at earth.google.com), which 
displays 3-D maps and images.
You can create and store word processing docu­
ments and spreadsheets. Why buy Microsoft 
Word or Microsoft Excel or WordPerfect when 
Google Docs & Spreadsheets can do the job? 
Go to docs.google.com, create a free 
Google account, and go to it. All you need is your 
browser. Neither the word processor nor the 
spreadsheet program is as powerful as PC-based 
programs such as Word and Excel, but for basic 
documents, they do the job. One of the nicest fea­
tures is that you can share your documents and 
spreadsheets with your co-workers and friends 
so that they can see and edit the documents, too. 
For more information, see the section in Chapter 
18 about sharing documents and calendars.
You can send and receive e-mail. We tell you 
about Google Mail (Gmail) in Chapter 13.
You can organize and display your digital 
photos. Google offers the Picasa program (at 
picasa.google.com), which helps you 
organize your photos, provides a photo editor, 
and enables you to upload them to your own 
photo Web site.
Google adds more features almost every week. 
To see what it’s offering, start at google.
com, click More, and choose Even More from 
the menu that appears.

the page name doesn’t use an exclamation point.) As with all Web pages, the 
exact design may have changed by the time you read this section. A whole 
bunch of categories and subcategories are listed; click any of them to see 
another page that has even more subcategories and links to actual Web pages. 
You can click a link to a page if you see one you like, or click a sub-subcategory, 
and so on. Figure 8-4 shows the Yahoo! Directory page for Recreation & Sports.

The 404 blues
More often than we want to admit, when you 
click a link from a search results page, you 
see — rather than the promised page — a 
message such as 404 Not Found. What 
did you do wrong? Nothing. Web pages come 
and go and move around with great velocity, 
and the various Web search engines were 
designed as delivery vehicles (not garbage 
trucks), so they do a lousy job of cleaning out 
links to old, dead pages that have gone away.
At least the search engines are a bit better in 
this regard than the manual directories. That’s 
because search engines have software robots 
(called spiders because they roam the Web) 
that revisit all indexed pages every once in a 
while and note whether they still exist. Even so, 
many lonely months can pass between robot 
visits, and a great deal can happen to a page in 
the meantime. Google caches (stores) a copy of 
most pages it visits, so even if the original has 
gone away, you can click the Cache link at the 
end of a Google index entry to see a copy of the 
page as it was when Google last looked at it.

Early on, you could easily submit a Web page to Yahoo! by simply entering a 
description of the page and its Web address into the Submissions page and 
waiting a week or so for the editors to look at the new page. Submitting pages 
is now so popular that normal submissions take a long, long time (months) 
before anyone on staff looks at them, unless you pay them $299 a year for the 
“express” service. You can draw your own conclusions about how the fee 
affects what information gets into Yahoo! (and what doesn’t).
For facts, try Wikipedia first
	
Wikipedia, at en.wikipedia.org, is an encyclopedia you can use for free over 
the Internet. The site looks like Figure 8-5. Wiki means fast in Hawaiian (actually, 
wikiwiki does, best known before the Internet as the name of the interterminal 
bus at the Honolulu airport), and Wikipedia has earned its name. The Wikipedia 
project, which started in 2001, has grown to more than 3 million articles in 
English, covering almost every conceivable topic, from the Battle of Dunkirk to 
Dummies books. Yes, it even has a Key lime pie article, where you read this: “Key 
lime pie is made with canned sweetened condensed milk, since fresh milk was 
not a common commodity in the Florida Keys before modern refrigerated distri­
bution methods.” Also, since 2006, it has been the Florida state pie.
If you’re looking for the scoop on most topics, Wikipedia is a helpful place to 
start. You can search for article titles or article text. Words in the article body 
that are highlighted in blue link to other articles in Wikipedia. Many articles also

Here are some other ways to chase down a tan­
talizing link that has wandered off into nowhere:
	✓	The Internet Archive operates a nifty ser­
vice, the Wayback Machine, that can 
retrieve older versions of Web sites. Enter 
your broken link in its search box at www.
archive.org. (Yes, this site owns a lot 
of computers too.)
	✓	Sometimes Web sites try to tidy up a bit 
and move their files around in the process. 
If the broken link is a long one — say, 
www.frobliedoop.org/glompty-
dompty/snrok/amazingtip.
html — try its shorter versions: www.
frobliedoop.org/glompty-
dompty/snrok or www.froblie
doop.org/glompty-dompty or 
even www.frobliedoop.org to find 
clues to where they put that tip. Also try a 
Google search on just the filename, such as 
amazingtip.html. You might find a 
copy at another Web site.
	✓	Finally, we should mention that Web sites 
sometimes shut down, because of either 
equipment failure or periodic maintenance. 
(Late nights, Sunday mornings, and major 
holidays are favorite times for the latter.) Your 
404 link just might magically work tomorrow.
Bad links are all just part of life on the online 
frontier — the high-tech equivalent of riding 
your horse along the trail in the Old West and 
noticing that there sure are a lot of bleached-
white cattle skulls lying around.

are created and edited by a volunteer team of more than 300,000 active contribu­
tors. Wikipedia exists in dozens of other languages as well. (The en at the begin­

Who pays for all this stuff?
You may be wondering who pays for all these 
wonderful search systems. Advertising supports 
all except two of them. On every page of most 
search systems, you see lots and lots of ads. It 
used to be that ad revenue was skimpy — hence 
the dot-com bust of 2000, — but then the search 
sites discovered an important secret: When you 
enter keywords, you’re telling the search site 
something about your interests at the moment. 
That information turns out to be extremely valu­
able to advertisers. An automobile company 
might pay a lot to have its ad near the top of the 
results page when you search for automobile 
dealer Kansas. Some sites (notably, Google) 
auction off prime ad placement. Google marks all 
such ads as “sponsored links.” Usually, they’re 
on the right side of the results page, but some­
times they’re on top with a colored background. 
(Surprise — this type costs more.) Other search 
sites may not be as scrupulous. Advertisers pay 
Google when you click their links.
Wikipedia works on the open source model. The 
vast majority of contributors are unpaid volun­
teers, but the substantial bills for running the 
site are paid by grants and donations. If you use 
Wikipedia much, you should kick in a few bucks.

Part III: Web Mania 
The ten-minute challenge
Our friend Doug Hacker (his real name) claims 
to be able to find the answer to any factual 
query on the Net in less than ten minutes. We 
challenged him to find a quote we vaguely knew 
from the liner notes of a Duke Ellington album 
whose title we couldn’t remember. He had 
the complete quote in about an hour but spent 
less than five minutes himself actually search-
ing. How? He found a mailing list about Duke 
Ellington, subscribed, and asked the question. 
Several members replied in short order. The 
more time you spend finding your way around 
the Net, the more you know where to go for the 
information you need.
Anyone can edit most Wikipedia articles whenever they want. That might 
seem to be a prescription for chaos, but most articles are watched over by 
interested volunteers, and inappropriate edits are quickly reversed, so the 
overall quality remains remarkably high.
 
If the idea of editing encyclopedia articles on your favorite subjects sounds 
appealing, talk to your family first. Wikipedia can be extremely addictive.
Articles are supposed to reflect a neutral point of view (NPOV, in Wikispeak), 
but a few topics — such as abortion, creationism, and Middle East politics — 
are continually debated. Wikipedia isn’t as authoritative as conventional works, 
like Encyclopædia Britannica, but its articles are usually up-to-date and to the 
point, with side issues dealt with by links to other articles. One particularly cool 
Wikipedia feature is its collection of comprehensive lists, en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Category:Lists, on all sorts of arcane subjects. One of our favorites 
is the list of countries with mains power plugs, voltages, and frequencies; type 
Mains power systems in the Search box to find it.
 
If you do a Google search on a topic, a Wikipedia article is likely to show up as 
one of the links Google returns. That link might be a good place to start reading.
The Usual Suspects: Other 
Useful Search Sites
After you surf around Yahoo!, Google, and Bing for a while, you may want to 
check out the competition. Here are some search Web sites that provide spe-
cialized types of searches:
 
✓ About.com: This directory (at www.about.com) has several hundred 
semiprofessional “guides” who manage the topic areas. The guides vary 
from okay to very good (Margy knows a couple of very good ones), so if 
you’re looking for in-depth information on a topic, check About.com to 

143
 Chapter 8: Needles and Haystacks: Finding Almost Anything on the Web
see what the guide has to say. The site was purchased by The New York 
Times in 2005.
 
✓ Bytedog: Bytedog (www.bytedog.com) assembles the results of searches 
at other search engines and presents them in a ranked list with cute dog 
graphics (cuter than Microsoft’s, if you ask us). It takes a few extra sec-
onds to respond, but that’s because it’s filtering out bad links before you 
have to deal with them. Bytedog, which also includes a Web directory, is a 
project of a couple of students at the University of Waterloo, Ontario.
Finding People
Finding people on the Internet is surprisingly easy. It’s so easy that, indeed, 
sometimes it’s creepy. Two overlapping categories of people-finders are avail-
able: those that look for people on the Net with e-mail and Web addresses and 
those that look for people in real life with phone numbers and street addresses.
Looking for e-mail addresses
The process of finding e-mail and Web addresses is somewhat hit-and-miss. 
Because no online equivalent to the telephone company’s official phone book has 
ever existed, your best bet is to type into Google a person’s name and a few other 
identifying words (such as the town where the person lives and the company 
where the person works) to see whether any of the matches it finds includes an 
address. Finding addresses by searching used to be pretty easy, but in recent 
years, as spammers have taken to scraping every address they can find off 
the Web, a lot of Web sites now “munge” (obscure) or delete e-mail addresses.
 
You can search online all you want, but there’s no substitute for calling some-
one up and asking, “What’s your e-mail address?”
Googling for people
Type someone’s name and address at Google (for the address, type at least 
the state abbreviation, but more is better), and it shows you matches from 
phone book listings.
 
If you’re wondering whether someone has a Web page, use Google or Yahoo! 
or Bing to search for just the person’s name. If you’re wondering whether 
you’re famous, use Google or Yahoo! or Bing to search for your own name 
to see how many people mention you or link to your Web pages. (If you do it 
more than once, you’re egosurfing.) If you receive e-mail from someone you 
don’t know, search Google for the e-mail address — unless the message was 
spam, the address is bound to appear on a Web page somewhere.

Using other people-search sites
Here are some other sites that search for people:
 
✓ WhoWhere: WhoWhere (whowhere.lycos.com) is an e-mail address 
directory. Although Yahoo! usually gives better results, some people are 
listed in WhoWhere who aren’t listed in other places.
 
✓ Yahoo! People Search: You can search for addresses and phone num-
bers and e-mail addresses at people.yahoo.com. If you don’t like your 
own listing, you can add, update, or delete it.
 
✓ Yellow pages directories: Quite a few “yellow pages” business directo-
ries, both national and local, are on the Net, at www.superpages.com, 
www.yellow.pages.com, and www.infousa.com. The directories in 
this list are some of the national ones. InfoUSA even offers credit reports 
and other unpleasantly intrusive information. 
 
✓ Canada 411: Canada 411 (canada411.com) is a complete Canadian 
telephone book, sponsored by the major Canadian telephone compa-
nies. Aussi disponsible en français, eh? For several years the listings for 
Alberta and Saskatchewan were missing, leading to concern that the 
two provinces were too boring to bother with, but they’re all there now, 
proving that they’re just as gnarly as everyone else.
We’re from Your Browser, and 
We’re Here to Help You
Every search engine wants to be your best friend, which no doubt by coin-
cidence will increase its market share. (Who? Us? Opinionated?) To cement 
that friendship, browser makers go to great effort to arrange so that when 
you type some search words, the search happens on its own search engine 
rather than on anyone else’s.
Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari all have a search box to the right of the 
address box, as shown in Figure 8-6.
If you type a word or phrase in a search box, your browser opens your pre-
ferred search engine and displays the results of a search on what you typed. 
Or, if you type in the address box an entry that doesn’t look like an address, 
it pretends that you typed it in the search box and searches anyway. (Google 
Chrome has only one box where you type something, and it decides what you 
wanted.) How convenient is that! You can specify which search engine you 
want this feature to use:
 
✓ Firefox: Choose a search engine from its short list by clicking the search 
engine icon to the right of the address box (and to the left of the search 

145
 Chapter 8: Needles and Haystacks: Finding Almost Anything on the Web
box). Click the icon and choose another site. Or, choose Manage 
Search Engines to display a list of search engines that Firefox knows 
about and add your favorites.
 
✓ Internet Explorer: Choose Tools➪Internet Options, click the General tab 
if it isn’t already selected, and click Settings in the Search section.
 
✓ Safari: Click the little magnifying glass in the search box, where the 
menu will offer a choice between Yahoo! and Google.
 
✓ Google Chrome: Click the Customize (wrench) icon to the right of 
the address box, select Options, click the Basics tab if it’s not already 
selected, and set Default Search to your favorite search site. Click the 
Manage button if you want to choose a site that isn’t on the list.

Too Many Toolbars
Every search engine vendor offers a toolbar that you can add to your browser. 
The toolbar is a bar above your browser’s main window with a search box 
and some other stuff on it, such as links to relevant Web sites and sometimes 
browser tools such as pop-up blockers. Back when browsers were young and 
didn’t have search boxes and built-in pop-up blockers, the toolbars were some-
what useful. These days, they’re mostly a way to force another search-engine-
specific search box into your browser, taking up space on your screen that 
would otherwise be available to look at Web pages (see Figure 8-7).
We generally recommend that you decline any invitations to install browser 
toolbars, because their value is marginal. If a specific toolbar has a specific 
feature you want that isn’t otherwise available in your browser, such as the 
page rank display on the Google toolbar, it doesn’t hurt to install it, other 
than losing that half-inch of screen real estate.
 
To get rid of unwanted toolbars in Internet Explorer, right click in a blank part 
of any menu or toolbar to open a menu where you can deselect the ones you 
don’t want. To get rid of toolbars in Firefox, choose Tools➪Add-Ons (which 
shows all add-ons, including the toolbars), click the one you don’t want, and 
then click the Uninstall button that appears.

Making a Custom Start Page
Many sites want you to use them as your start page (the page your browser 
loads when it starts up, as described in Chapter 7). To encourage you to do 
so, these sites enable to you customize them to show all kinds of useful infor-
mation just for you.
For example, if you create a free Google account, you can have a fancy, 
custom iGoogle page rather than the boring, plain one that most folks use. 
Click the Sign In link in the upper right corner of the Google page and create 
an account if you don’t already have one (by clicking the Create an Account 
Now link). After you’re logged in, go to igoogle.com if you don’t see instruc-
tions for making a personalized home page. Your page can include a clock, 
calendar, weather report, news headlines, and other features.
Getting the goods on goods and services
All commercial directories and search engines 
now offer shopping information to help get your 
credit card closer to the Web faster. Search 
results from Google and Bing have a Shopping 
link at the top, which opens a page full of links to 
items at online stores. You can find stuff for sale 
from all over, offering every conceivable item 
(and some inconceivable items). We tell you all 
the do’s, don’ts, and how-to’s in Chapter 10.

147
 Chapter 8: Needles and Haystacks: Finding Almost Anything on the Web
Yahoo! provides similar features. (They even predate Google’s by several 
years.) From my.yahoo.com, sign in and click Add Content to choose infor-
mation to put on your My Yahoo! page, such as news headlines, stock prices, 
sports scores, Facebook updates, and other news. John likes My Yahoo! 
enough that he has made it his home page.

A
thousand years ago, when we wrote the first edition of Internet For 
Dummies, Internet content consisted almost entirely of text. (It was 
1993, but it sure feels like a thousand years ago.) You could download a few 
archives of pictures, and there was this weird thing, the World Wide Web, 
that could mix together pictures and text on the same page, but for the most 
part, it consisted of text: People’s connections were so slow, downloading 
pictures took so long, and computer screens were so fuzzy that we stuck 
to text. The pictures you could download were single images, such as car­
toons and snapshots. Audio was nearly unheard of (so to speak), and video 
files were so bulky that even if you could find a clip and wait a week for it to 
download, it wouldn’t fit on your computer’s disk. By the late 1990s, Internet 
connections had sped up enough and screens had improved enough that 
pictures were normal fare — and audio was entering the mainstream enough 
that we put a sample voice message on our Web site, in case any of our read­
ers had sound cards. (It’s still there, at net.gurus.org/ngc.wav.)
Things have advanced a little since then. Ordinary users now have Net con­
nections that run at several million bits per second — faster than the main 
backbones of the early 1990s — and computer disks have gotten enormous 
beyond imagining. Passing around audio and video over the Net has become 

150
Part III: Web Mania 
practical and widespread. In fact, the amounts of available audio and video 
are now so vast that you could spend your entire life looking at online com­
mercials without ever finding anything worth watching. This chapter tries to 
bring a little order to the vast wasteland of online media.
	
To avoid writing audio and/or video a hundred more times in this chapter, 
henceforth we use the concise (albeit imprecise) term media to refer to them.
Seven Ways to Get Media 
and One Way Not To
You can get your media fix in approximately ten zillion different programs 
and formats. Fortunately, they fall into a modest number of categories: free, 
streaming, rented, purchased, shared, and outright stolen.
Receive it as a gift
The simplest approach is to download media offered for free and then play it. 
Visit www.nasa.gov/multimedia, where NASA has lots of free little movies 
on topics ranging from dust storms on Mars to how a roller coaster ride feels 
like taking off in the space shuttle. You can also find independent movies and 
videos from producers more interested in letting people see their work than 
in charging for it. Visit epitonic.com for an eclectic collection of music 
by artists, some well known and some obscure, released so that people can 
listen to it and make their own mixes.
Borrow it
Even on a broadband connection, downloading a whole media clip can take a 
while. Rather than download first and play later, streaming media downloads 
as it plays, thereby re-creating (in a complex digital manner) the way that 
radio and TV have worked since the 1920s. As with TV and radio, after it’s 
streamed, it’s gone — and if you want to play it again, you have to stream 
it again. Streaming audio can work over a dialup connection, but streaming 
video needs a broadband connection.
Most streaming media is provided on demand: You click a link and they send 
you whatever it is, sort of like a jukebox. Alternatively, sometimes streaming 
media is a single program to which you can listen in and hear what’s playing 
at any moment. Not surprisingly, it’s named Internet radio, and in many cases 

151
 Chapter 9: Music and Video on the Web
the audio stream is an actual radio program, such as our local public radio 
stations at wrvo.fm (click Listen Live) in upstate New York and www.vpr.
net (click Listen Online) in Vermont. We say more about Internet radio later 
in this chapter.
Rent it
A great deal of music isn’t available for free, but it’s available for cheap. 
Services such as Real Networks Rhapsody (www.real.com/rhapsody) offer 
monthly subscriptions that let you listen to large libraries of recorded music. 
Napster (www.napster.com) charges about $5 per month for unlimited 
streaming music and five MP3 downloads each month that you can play on 
your MP3 player or cellphone. You pay a fixed monthly fee, and then you can 
click songs from a catalog to play them and to make and share playlists of 
your favorites.
These rental services have enormous catalogs of music, and each one claims 
to be the largest. They really are large: While checking out Rhapsody, we 
were finally able to do a side-by-side comparison of Desi Arnaz’s muscular 
late-1940s version of Babalu and his mentor Xavier Cugat’s more elegant 1941 
recording. (You’ll just have to decide for yourself which one you like better.) 
However, when you stop paying rent, your music vanishes — remember, you 
never owned it.
You can find video-rental Web sites too — not just for renting a DVD but 
also for downloading the video over the Internet and watching it on your 
computer. For example, Netflix, at www.netflix.com, is known for its DVD-
rental-by-mail service, but you can also download videos on demand. Not 
all its DVDs are available for download, but for the ones that are, you see a 
Play button on the Web site. Blockbuster, at www.blockbuster.com, lets 
you rent or buy downloaded movies. Note that Blockbuster works with only 
Internet Explorer, not with Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.
Buy it
Apple iTunes makes buying music easy. Go to www.apple.com/itunes to 
listen to the first little bit of any song in its catalog. If you like it, you can buy 
your own, permanent copy (for 99 cents) that you can copy to your iPod, play 
on your computer, or burn on a CD. You don’t have to be a Mac user to use 
iTunes; you can play the tunes by using the Windows version of the iTunes pro­
gram. (See the section “Organizing your music with iTunes,” later in this chap­
ter.) It’s no surprise that people buy in droves, making iTunes the biggest online 
music store. Likewise, many more Web sites sell music either from a Web store 
or as an add-on to a rental service, most for about the same price as iTunes.

152
Part III: Web Mania 
Amazon.com (www.amazon.com), the world’s largest bookstore, also sells 
downloadable tunes in MP3 format.
Already own it
You probably own a whole lot of digital music in the form of music CDs. 
Copying your music CDs to your computer is known as ripping, and it’s easy 
to do. Windows Media Player, iTunes, and other music programs can copy all 
tracks from a CD and put the songs into your music library so that you can 
play them from your computer (without the CD) or copy them to your MP3 
player. See “Copying music from your own CDs,” later in this chapter.
Share it
The original version of Napster was the first well-known music exchange 
service, allowing members to download MP3 music files from each other 
for free. The system was the first large-scale peer-to-peer (P2P) information 
exchange, where people exchange files with each other rather than download 
them from a central library. Eventually, the big record labels sued and shut 
it down because most of the material that people exchanged was in flagrant 
violation of the music’s copyright. Napster was later reincarnated as a site for 
music rental and free online music streaming — but no free downloading.
Two current popular file-sharing systems are BitTorrent (www.bittorrent.
com) and LimeWire (www.limewire.com), which have thus far been able to 
fly under the legal radar. Each one is much like what Napster was — a network 
from which you can download music for free, a certain amount of which is pro­
vided against the wishes of the owners of said music. While you’re download­
ing music from other people’s computers, they are in turn downloading music 
from you, so they can significantly slow down your computer and your Internet 
connection. The music industry insists that these folks are morally reprehen­
sible, but particularly with BitTorrent, people use it to share large amounts of 
entirely legal and legitimate material along with the dodgy stuff.
Subscribe to it
You can subscribe to audio programs over the Internet. A podcast is an audio 
file distributed over the Net for listening to on an iPod or another type of 
MP3 player or any computer with speakers. Many radio shows are available 
as podcasts; go to www.npr.org to find many of them. Lots of organizations 
and people make podcasts, too. See the section “Subscribing to podcasts 
with iTunes,” later in this chapter, for instructions.

153
 Chapter 9: Music and Video on the Web
Steal it — um, no
Plenty of pirated stuff is still on the Net, and probably always will be. We 
expect that our readers, because they’re of good moral character, wouldn’t 
want to look for it, but if you do, you have to do so without our help.
What Are You Listening With?
The three most popular programs used for playing Web-based online media 
are Windows Media Player, Real Player, and Apple iTunes. The first two 
include separate player programs and plug-ins for Web browsers so that Web 
pages can embed little windows that show movies or play music. You eventu­
ally have to install all three if you want to handle all the links you click. All 
three work pretty well.
Downloads for the post-literate
Not all downloadable audio files contain music. 
A thriving niche market exists for what used to 
be called “talking books.” You can download 
books and magazines and just about anything 
else you might otherwise read, as well as radio 
programs you might have missed. Although lis­
tening to downloaded books on your computer 
works fine — and it can be an essential tool for 
the visually impaired — it’s kind of pointless if 
you can read the paper book faster than you 
can listen to it (and kick back on the patio while 
you’re at it). But if you drive to work or go jog­
ging, a talking book on CD in the car player (or 
copied to the MP3 player or iPod on your belt) 
is just the ticket.
The largest source of talking books is Audible.
com (www.audible.com). You can buy indi­
vidual books for book-like prices or subscribe and 
listen to one or two books a month cheaper than 
you can by paying individually. Either way, the 
books you buy are yours to keep. They provide a 
reasonably nice program that you can download 
and install to keep track of the files for the books 
you bought and then burn them to CDs (lots of 
CDs — about 15 for a full-length book). Audible 
has also made deals with many other media 
programs, so you can find an Audible plug-in for 
iTunes that lets you copy your books to an iPod, 
as well as a plug-in for Windows Media Player 
for all the MP3 devices it handles, and so forth.
Audible usually offers a trial subscription with 
a couple of free books, and its catalog includes 
public-interest stuff (such as presidential inau­
gural speeches) available for free if you want to 
try it out. Warning: John tried it out and ended 
up inventing errands that involved driving to 
faraway stores so that he could listen to the 
last CD of The DaVinci Code. On the other hand, 
Margy’s husband survived a long commute 
thanks to his Audible subscription.

iTunes
www.apple.com/itunes
iTunes, shown in Figure 9-1, has become insanely popular because you have 
to use it if you have an iPhone or iPod. In addition to playing and organiz­
ing music, iTunes, from Apple, is the way to load music from your computer 
onto iPods and iPhones. You may have heard of it as a music store and a way 
to organize music, but iTunes can play all sorts of media, including videos. 
iTunes supports streaming video as well as audio in most popular formats.
Ripping CDs to your computer and keeping your music organized in iTunes 
are described later in this chapter.

Windows Media Player
www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia
Microsoft has its own streaming audio and video formats, and it bundles a 
player for them with Windows. The Windows Media Player program, shown 
in Figure 9-2, can play files in Advanced Systems Format (with the extension 
.asf or .asx), in addition to most other formats. More recent versions 
added useful new features, so if you don’t have Media Player version 11 or 
later, it’s worth your time to visit Windows Update or the Media Player site to 
download it. (Media Player itself may nag you to upgrade if you have an older 
version.)

Click the Library tab on the left side of the Media Player window to see which 
audio and video files you have. Click Media Guide to browse links to popular 
music. When you put an audio CD into your computer’s CD drive, it displays 
the list of tracks on the CD and you can click Rip CD to rip (copy) tracks from 
the CD to your hard drive and to your Windows Media Player library. You can 
also burn music CDs by clicking the Burn tab.
RealPlayer
www.real.com
Another system for playing streaming media files, the kind you borrow 
or rent, is RealPlayer. Files in the Real format have the extension .ra or 
.ram. To play RealAudio files, you need the RealPlayer program, which you 
can download from www.real.com. The RealAudio player also handles 
RealVideo, which shows smallish moving pictures to accompany your sound.
Okay, How about Some Music?
Two hot activities on the Internet are downloading and exchanging music 
files with your friends in the MP3 file format. MP3 stands for MPEG level 3 
(acronyms within acronyms — how technoid) and is simply the soundtrack 
format used with MPEG movies. Because that format is widely available and 

156
Part III: Web Mania 
does a good job of compressing music to a reasonable size for downloading, 
it has been adopted by music lovers on the Net. As you may already have 
guessed, MP3 players (similar to iPods and little, less-expensive devices from 
Sandisk and Rio) can play MP3 files, too, which is the main reason for their 
popularity. Many mobile phone models can play MP3 files, too.
You can play MP3 files by using many different programs, including iTunes, 
RealPlayer, and Windows Media Player. This section explains how to use 
iTunes to organize music, subscribe to podcasts, make playlists, and listen 
to radio stations over the Internet because all the programs are fairly similar. 
If you use Windows Media Player or RealPlayer, you get the general idea.
Naturally, Microsoft has the competing file format WMA, with the extension 
.wma. Real Player and iTunes can also handle WMA.
Copying music from your own CDs
You already own tons of music on those racks of CDs that will soon be obso­
lete. You can rip (copy) the tracks from an audio CD by using iTunes. When 
you put an audio CD into your computer’s CD drive, iTunes asks whether you 
want to import the tracks into you iTunes library. Click Yes to begin copying. 
iTunes looks up the CD using an online database so that you can see the titles 
of the tracks and even the album artwork.
	
When you rip music from CDs, you can specify which format to store the 
files in. We use the MP3 format because the files are smaller than some other 
formats and because every music player can handle MP3s. In iTunes, choose 
Edit➪Preferences, click the General tab if it’s not already selected, click 
the Import Settings button, click the Import Using option and set it to MP3 
Encoder. You can also choose the quality, where you trade off file size against 
sound quality.
Organizing your music with iTunes
Apple iTunes (www.apple.com/itunes) lets you buy legal, downloaded 
songs for a reasonable price, from 99 cents apiece and up, based on popular­
ity. Both Mac and Windows users can buy and play songs from iTunes by 
downloading the free iTunes program, which is excellent for keeping your 
songs organized even if you don’t have an iPod or buy from the iTunes store.

157
 Chapter 9: Music and Video on the Web
Making playlists
In iTunes, you can organize your music into playlists, which are your own, 
customized albums. One playlist can be music you like to listen to while 
washing the dishes, and another playlist might be for your fabulous oldies 
collection. Or, each user of your computer can have her own playlists. You 
can have as many playlists as you like. (Margy has one playlist of the bari­
tone parts she needs to learn for her women’s barbershop group, Maiden 
Vermont, and another playlist of instrumental jazz, 1960s rock, and Hindu 
chanting to listen to at work.)
You create a new playlist by choosing File➪New Playlist or by pressing 
Ctrl+N. You can name the playlist whatever you want and then drag in music 
from your library. Dragging a song from the library to a playlist doesn’t 
remove it from the library or copy the file — you can put the same song into 
multiple playlists, and all the while it continues to be stored in your general 
iTunes library just once.
Subscribing to Podcasts
Podcasts are audio magazines that deliver MP3 files of talk or music directly 
to your computer (see the section “Subscribe to it,” earlier in this chapter). 
Radio programs, companies, musicians, comedians, and just plain people 
produce podcasts about a huge variety of different subjects, everything from 
“The Twilight Saga” to the stock market.
Subscribing to podcasts on the Web
Several Web sites provide directories of podcasts, including Podcast.com 
and PodcastAlley.com. They enable you to find podcasts by topic, subscribe 
to them, and listen to them from the Web site.
Or, go to the Web site of the program you want to subscribe to. National 
Public Radio at www.npr.org originates dozens of podcasts.

158
Part III: Web Mania 
Subscribing to podcasts with iTunes
To subscribe to a podcast, click the iTunes Store link in iTunes and then click 
the Podcasts link. When you find a podcast that looks interesting, you can 
click an episode to listen to it on the spot or click the Subscribe button to 
receive all future episodes automatically. Most podcasts are free, and iTunes 
downloads the latest episodes every time you start the program.
Playing Music and Podcasts
If you want to listen to music or podcasts while you’re sitting in front of your 
computer, you’re all set — fire up iTunes, RealPlayer, or Windows Media 
Player and listen. But we hear that some people actually have lives and want 
to listen to music in other places.
You can buy a portable MP3 player — an iPod, a cheaper alternative from 
Sandisk or Rio, or a phone that includes an MP3 player — and take thousands 
of MP3 cuts to listen to while you jog, travel, or just hang out. It’s similar to 
a Walkman, but you don’t need tapes or CDs. You hook your MP3 player to 
your computer whenever you want to download new tunes. These players 
can hold weeks of music and podcasts. The most popular is the ubiquitous 
Apple iPod, but lots of other players are cheaper and work fine. Only iPods 
can play M4P (copy-protected) music and only files to which you own a 
license. Or, check whether your mobile phone can play MP3 files.
More threats and promises
Folks ripping their favorite tunes from CDs and 
e-mailing them to their 50 closest friends com­
prise a hideous threat to the recording industry, 
not to mention that they’re violating copyright 
law. (The previous hideous threats, for read­
ers old enough to remember, were cassette 
tapes and home VCRs, which totally destroyed 
the music and movie industries. What — they 
didn’t? Uh, well, this time it’s different because, 
um, just because it is.) The industry’s efforts to 
shut down Web sites that offer ripped songs for 
free downloading has been moderately suc­
cessful, but private e-mail is hard to stop.
The recording industry came up with the 
Secure Digital Music Initiative, a music file 
format of its own. The SDMI was intended to let 
you download but not share music. It flopped, 
partly because it had technical defects quickly 
analyzed and reported by enterprising college 
professors and students and partly because 
nobody wanted crippleware music. The record­
ing industry has been filing lawsuits against the 
most visible music sharers, on the peculiar 
theory that if it threatens and sues its custom­
ers, their attitudes will improve and they will 
buy more stuff. Maybe someday the industry 
will figure out, as Apple did, that if it sells decent 
music at reasonable prices and lets customers 
listen to it the way they want to, people will pay 
for it.

159
 Chapter 9: Music and Video on the Web
Listening to Internet Radio
If you like to listen to music while you work, check out real radio stations or 
Internet-only radio stations. Most radio stations now stream their talk and music 
on the Internet in addition to broadcasting it over the air. Go to a radio station’s 
Web site and click the Listen Now or similarly named link — for example, we’re 
listening to a show about backyard chickens at wbur.org as we write this sec­
tion. Many radio stations have MP3 players built into their Web sites.
Tuning into a station
Like real radio stations, Internet-only stations offer a mix of music and talk 
and sometimes commercials. Unlike real (broadcast) radio stations, they’re 
extremely cheap to set up, so lots and lots of people do — providing lots of 
quirky little niche stations run by people all over the world. You listen to 
them in a streaming program, usually iTunes, Real Player, or Windows Media. 
Most are available for free, some require a subscription, and some have a 
subscription option to make the ads go away.
If you use iTunes, click the Radio link in iTunes to get started. You see a 
menu of different types of stations, and after choosing one, you can peruse 
stations from across the country at your leisure for free. Double-click a sta­
tion to listen to it.
To get started, here are some directories of Internet radio stations:
	
✓	music.yahoo.com — Yahoo! Music and then click Radio➪Radio Station 
Guide.
There’s CDs, and then there’s CDs
Although all CDs look the same, they don’t all 
play the same. Normal audio CDs contain a 
maximum of about 74 minutes of music and 
work on every CD player ever made. When you 
burn a CD-R (the kind of CD you can write to 
only once), you’re making a normal audio CD. 
Because blank CD-Rs are cheap (about 20 
cents apiece if you buy them in quantity), the 
main disadvantage of this approach is that you 
end up with large stacks of CDs.
MP3 files are much smaller than audio CD files, 
so if you burn a CD full of MP3s, you can put 
about ten hours of music on each disc. DVD 
players and many recent CD players can play 
MP3 CDs. If you’re not sure whether your 
player can handle MP3 CDs, just make one 
on your computer and try it in your player. It 
doesn’t hurt your player, although you might 
see some odd error messages. Although rewrit­
able CD-RWs don’t work in normal CD players, 
players that can handle MP3 CDs can usually 
handle CD-RWs. Again, if you’re not sure, try it; 
it doesn’t hurt anything if it doesn’t work.

✓	shoutcast.com — SHOUTcast Radio, from AOL, gives you a choice of 
its own SHOUTcast Radio Mini Player or your existing player.
	
✓	www.live365.com — Live 365 Internet Radio streams several thousand 
stations with every possible kind of music
Either way (broadcast radio or Internet-only radio), you can listen to talk and 
music from all over the United States — or the world.
Making your own station
Every radio station — Internet or broadcast — chooses a range of styles 
of music to play. Why should you be limited to the musical tastes of exist­
ing radio stations? Instead, you can create your own musical mix, including 
music you don’t even own!
Enter Pandora Radio, at www.pandora.com (shown in Figure 9-3). As its Web 
site states, it’s a new kind of radio station, one that plays only music you like. 
Type the names of a musician or group or the name of a song, and Pandora 
finds, in its huge musical database, music that’s similar to what you specify. 
You can’t play the exact song you want, but you can play similar music, 
displaying information about the artist and album. When Pandora guesses 
wrong about what it thinks you like, you can click the thumbs-down icon to 
kill the song. When it guesses right, click the thumbs-up icon to tell it to play 
more songs like that one.
	
Figure 9-3: 
Make your 
own radio 
station at 
Pandora.
	
You can name your “radio station” and have several stations for different 
kinds of music — maybe one for while you’re working and another to pay 
bills by. You can also share your radio station with other people so that they 
can listen to the mix you have created.

Watching Movies on the Net
Now that most people have fast Internet connections, watching video over 
the Net has become possible and popular. You can watch short videos at 
YouTube, television shows, or entire movies or upload your own videos for 
others to watch.
Older Web browsers, such as Firefox before version 3.5, can’t play videos — 
you need to get a player program. You also need a reasonably fast computer 
to display movies in anything close to real time. Flash, the most widely used 
player, plugs into your Web browser. iTunes, RealPlayer, and Windows Media 
Player also handle movies (and are described earlier in this chapter).
The YouTube thing
Probably the largest Internet video phenomenon is YouTube (www.you­
tube.com). It’s a site like Google (which owns YouTube), but rather than 
an Internet search engine for information at large, it’s only for videos. On 
YouTube you can find everything from Saturday Night Live clips to previews 
for upcoming movies to strange homemade Lego flicks. According to The New 
York Times, people post more than 100 million videos on YouTube every day. 
Unfortunately, Google is losing an amazing amount of money on YouTube 
every day because few advertisers want their ads displayed alongside such a 
weird and unpredictable collection of videos.
In the search box, you can type a word or phrase related to the video you’re 
looking for and YouTube displays a list of links of possible videos, as shown 
in Figure 9-4. Click the image or title to play the video. Video-playing software 
is embedded in the Web site, so you don’t need anything but an Internet con­
nection to watch videos on YouTube (see the later sidebar “Too many video 
file formats”). If you see a video you like a lot and want to share with your 50 
closest friends, you can click the Share link below the video to e-mail a link, 
post a tweet on Twitter (see Chapter 19), or write it on your Facebook wall 
(as described in Chapter 18). The e-mail arrives with a link to the YouTube 
page that has the video on it.
Google has formed its own niche in the world of Internet movies with Google Video 
(video.google.com), a site similar to YouTube. Because Google now owns 
YouTube, the two sites are morphing into one. Other YouTube-like Web sites 
include Metacafe (www.metacafe.com) and MSN Video (video.msn.com).

Putting the “you” in YouTube
You can upload a video to YouTube as long as it’s on your computer, you 
own the copyright (YouTube deletes stolen videos), it isn’t defamatory or 
pornographic, and it’s no longer than ten minutes. To upload, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Create a free YouTube account by clicking the Create Account link in 
the upper right corner of any YouTube page.
	
	 Or, sign in to your existing account. If you have a Google account, use it.
	
2.	Click the Upload button.
	
	 Or, click the Post a Video Response link below an existing video.
	
3.	Select the video file on your computer and follow the instructions.
	
	 You can choose whether to make the video public or private, name the 
video, and specify which category it’s in. YouTube uploads your video and 
converts it to the Flash format for streaming. Uploading can take a while 
(10 to 20 minutes) depending on the speed of your Internet connection.
After your video is on YouTube, you can share it with your friends.
	
If a video is public on YouTube, it’s really, really public. Think twice about 
including personally identifying information about yourself or your kids unless 
the video is something you’re truly proud of.

 Chapter 9: Music and Video on the Web
Watching TV
Missed your favorite television show? Didn’t record it on your TiVo? You 
might be able to catch it on Hulu, at www.hulu.com. It’s supported by ABC, 
Fox, NBC, and others, so it shows entire episodes, not ten-minute clips, 
and copyrighted shows aren’t liable to be deleted, as they are on YouTube. 
YouTube has responded with YouTube Shows, at www.youtube.com/
shows, which is different from the regular YouTube site; like Hulu, it has 
commercial video, with no amateur uploads.
Blip.tv (at blip.tv — no “.com” at the end) hosts shows you may never 
have heard of because they’re made by independent creators. Link TV (at 
www.linktv.org) shows educational programs from around the world.
Two Web sites offer advertising-supported, professional-quality videos on 
your PC: Joost (pronounced “juiced,” we imagine) at www.joost.com and 
BabelGum (from Italy) at www.babelgum.com. The sites are new, so check 
their selection of shows and how many ads they’re throwing at you.
Too many video file formats
The original standard digital-movie format is 
Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MPEG 
was designed by a committee down the hall 
from the JPEG committee that defined file 
formats for scanned photos and (practically 
unprecedented in the history of computer stan­
dards efforts) was designed based on earlier 
work. MPEG files have the extension .mpeg 
or .mpg.
Microsoft, responding to the challenge of 
emerging standards that it didn’t control, cre­
ated its own formats. Audio/Visual Interleave 
(AVI) format is for nonstreaming video, with the 
extension .avi. Advanced Streaming Format 
(with the extension .asf or .asx) is for both 
streaming audio and video data.
All these formats are being replaced by Flash 
because it’s what YouTube uses — files that 
end with .flv and a few variations. The Flash 
player (a free download from get.adobe.
com/flashplayer) plugs into your Web 
browser and plays streaming video in several 
qualities, including one that’s similar to HD tele­
vision.

164
Part III: Web Mania 
Watching movies
You can stream movies from the Web, although usually not for free (at least, 
not legally). If you have a Netflix account to read DVDs by mail, you can 
stream videos from its Web site (www.netflix.com) without paying any­
thing extra. Netflix has a huge inventory of DVDs, and many of them are also 
available for streaming. On the Web site, you add movies to your queue if 
you want to watch them later or receive the DVD by mail. Or, click the Watch 
Instantly tab to find a movie and watch it now.
Blockbuster, whose lunch Netflix was eating when Netflix began its DVD 
rental business, retaliated with an online service at www.blockbuster.com 
that is quite similar to Netflix.
Amazon.com offers a Video On Demand service, which enables you to stream 
movies for a fee. You can save movies for later after you pay for them, or you 
can watch a previously purchased video again. Choose the Movies Music & 
Games department and then click Video On Demand.
Sharing media around the home and dorm
Microsoft Windows 7 has a new feature that lets 
you set up all your computers, at least the ones 
running Windows 7, as a HomeGroup that can 
easily share resources on all your computers 
and other networked devices. Open Windows 
Media Player, switch to the Library page, and 
click Stream➪Turn On Media Streaming. If 
your computer isn’t already in a HomeGroup, 
it goes through the process to join an existing 
group and set one up. After you do that, the 
Library page shows an icon for the libraries of 
everyone else, on your computer and others, 
who has turned on media streaming, and you 
can play their stuff just like you can play your 
own. You’re also supposed to be able to play 
from your computer onto networked players 
and other devices; if your Windows 7 computer 
can see them on the network, it sets up icons so 
that you can access them.
You also have the option to allow streaming 
to the Internet, which we do not recommend 
because, unless you set up your system file pro­
tections very carefully, you can allow random 
strangers on the Net into your computer. We 
expect the most enthusiastic use of network 
media streaming will be in “homes” that are 
college dormitories, where everyone in the 
dorm is already on the same network, so now 
they can all share each other’s music at the 
click of a mouse.

T
he Internet is the world’s biggest bazaar, with stores that carry every­
thing from books to blouses, from DVDs to prescription drugs, from 
mutual funds to musical instruments, and from plane tickets to, uh, special­
ized personal products. (Don’t read too much into that one.) Shopping online 
is convenient — no parking or standing in line — and you can compare prices 
easily. But is online shopping safe? Well, we’ve bought all kinds of products 
online, and we’re still alive to tell the tale.
Shopping Online: Pros and Cons
Here are some reasons for shopping on the Net:
	
✓	Online stores are convenient and open all night, and they don’t mind if 
you aren’t wearing shoes or if you window-shop for a week before you 
buy something.
	
✓	Prices are often lower online, and you can compare prices at several 
online establishments in a matter of minutes. Even if you eventually 
make your purchase in a brick-and-mortar store, the information you 
find online can save you money. Shipping and handling is the same as 
you pay for mail order, and you don’t have to drive or park.
	
✓	Online stores can sometimes offer a better selection. They usually ship 
from a central warehouse rather than have to keep stock on the shelf at 
dozens of branches. If you’re looking for an item that’s hard to find — 
for example, a part for that vintage toaster oven you’re repairing — the 
Web can save you weeks of searching.

166
Part III: Web Mania 
	
✓	Sometimes, stuff just isn’t available locally. (The authors of this book 
live in small rural towns. Trumansburg, New York, is a wonderful place, 
but if you want to buy a new toaster, you’re out of luck. And Margy 
couldn’t find a harmonium anywhere in the Champlain Valley.)
	
✓	Unlike malls, online stores don’t have Muzak. (A few Web sites play 
background music, but we don’t linger on those sites.)
On the other hand, here are some reasons that you shouldn’t buy everything 
on the Net:
	
✓	You can’t physically look at or try on stuff before you buy it, and in most 
cases, you have to wait for it to be shipped to you. (We haven’t had 
much luck buying shoes and pants online, f’rinstance.)
	
✓	Your local stores deserve support so that they’ll be there when you 
need something right now or need their help in picking something out.
	
✓	You can’t flirt with the staff at a Web store or find out the latest town 
gossip.
The Credit Card Question
How do you pay for stuff you buy online? Usually, you pay by credit card, the 
same way you pay for anything else. Isn’t it incredibly, awfully dangerous to 
give out your credit card number online, though? Well, no.
When you use plastic at a restaurant, you give your physical card with your 
physical signature to the server, who takes it to the back room, does who-
knows-what with it, and then brings it back. Compared with that situation, 
the risk of sending your number to an online store is pretty small. A friend of 
ours used to run a restaurant and later an online store and assures us that 
there’s no comparison: The online store had none of the credit card prob­
lems that the restaurant did.
Many books (including earlier editions of this one) made a big deal about 
whether a Web site has a security certificate, which means that it shows a 
little lock in the corner of the Web browser window. The lock is nice to have, 
but the problem it solves, bad guys snooping on the connection somewhere 
between your PC and the seller’s Web site, isn’t a likely one unless you’re 
using a wireless network connection. We think you should worry more about 
whether a store selling something is run well enough that it actually ships 
you what you bought.

167
 Chapter 10: More Shopping, Less Dropping
	
Credit cards and debit cards look the same and spend the same, but credit 
cards bill you at the end of the month whereas debit cards take the money 
right out of your bank account. In the United States, consumer protection laws 
are much stronger for credit cards. The important difference is that in case of 
a disputed transaction, you have the money if you used a credit card but they 
have it if you used a debit card. Use a credit card to get the better protection, 
and then pay the bill at the end of the month so that you don’t owe interest.
If, after this harangue, you still don’t want to send your credit card number 
over the Internet, most online stores are happy to have you call in your 
card number over the phone (although, likely as not, an operator halfway 
around the globe then enters your credit card number by using the Internet). 
If you’re one of those fiscally responsible holdouts who doesn’t do plastic, 
send a check or money order.
Take a credit card number — any number
One of the cleverer innovations in online bank­
ing is virtual credit cards. If you want to place 
an online credit card order with a merchant you 
don’t entirely trust, first visit your bank’s Web 
site and tell the bank how much the order will 
cost, and on the spot, it may be able to concoct 
a brand-new card number. Then you return to 
the merchant’s site and order with that card 
number rather than with your regular number. 
As soon as the merchant places the charge, 
your bank links the new number to the mer­
chant, so even if the merchant leaks the number, 
it’s no good to anyone else. The number’s credit 
limit is the amount you set when you created 
it, so if the merchant tries to overcharge you, 
the bank says no. You can also create virtual 
numbers that are good for a set number of 
charges, for subscriptions that require regular 
payments.
Different banks use different names for this ser­
vice. Citibank and Discover call it virtual num­
bers. Bank of America calls it ShopSafe. Ask 
your bank whether it offers this service.
John found that virtual numbers also work for 
phone orders and mail orders and any other 
type of charge where you don’t use your physi­
cal card. Because he’s paranoid, he uses vir­
tual numbers for everything from his electric 
bill to his college alumni association. Don’t 
use them for buying plane tickets or reserving 
hotel rooms, though, because you often have to 
show a real card with the number at the check-
in desk.

Part III: Web Mania 
Paying at the Store
Buying stuff at an online store isn’t much different from buying it at a regular 
store. In the simplest case, a store sells only one item per Web page, as shown in 
Figure 10-1. To buy the item, you visit the page, you see the item, and you enter 
the payment and shipping details, and then the store sends the item to you.
Most stores hope you will buy several items at a time, so they use shopping 
carts instead. Margy runs the little online kids’ videotape store Great Tapes 
for Kids at www.greattapes.com. Originally, it had a single order page with 
an order form listing every tape in her rapidly expanding catalog. When the 
Great Tapes order form got hopelessly large, John reprogrammed it to pro­
vide a shopping cart to help track the items people order. (John will do prac­
tically anything to avoid writing.)
As you click your way around a site, you can toss items into your cart, adding 
and removing them as you want, by clicking a button labeled something 
like Add Item or Buy Now. When you have the items you want, you visit 
the virtual checkout line and buy the items in your cart. Until you visit the 
checkout, you can always take the items out of your cart if you decide that 
you don’t want them, and at online stores they don’t become shopworn, no 
matter how often you do that.
Figure 10-2 shows the Great Tapes for Kids shopping cart with two items in 
it. When you click the Proceed to Checkout button, the next page asks for the 
rest of your order details, much like the form shown earlier, in Figure 10-1.
Cookie alert
You may have heard horrible stories about the 
cookies that Web sites reputedly use to spy on 
you, steal your data, ravage your computer, 
inject cellulite into your hips while you sleep, 
and otherwise make your life miserable. After 
extensive investigation, we have found that 
most cookies aren’t bad; when you’re shopping 
online, they can even be quite helpful. (See the 
section “Cookies aren’t so bad” in Chapter 2 for 
more info about cookies.)
A cookie is no more than a little chunk of text 
that a Web site sends to a PC with a request 
(not a command) to send the cookie back during 
future visits to the same Web site. The cookie 
is stored on your computer in the form of a tiny 
snippet of text. That’s all it is. For online shop­
ping carts, cookies let the Web server track 
the items you have selected but not yet bought, 
even if you log out and turn off your computer 
in the interim. Stores can also use cookies to 
keep track of the last time you visited and what 
you bought, but they can keep that data on their 
own computers, so what’s the big deal? (If you 
don’t want Web sites to store cookies on your 
computer, you can prevent them; see how in 
Chapter 7.)

Part III: Web Mania 
Some stores even have the online equivalents of layaway plans and gift regis­
tries. For example, some Web shopping sites let you add items to a wish list 
that you can share with your friends so that you or someone else can buy the 
item for you later. Some sites offer gift certificates, too, for shopping online.
How Little Do You Want to Pay?
As little as possible, of course. About 15 minutes after the second online 
store appeared, someone realized that you could look at the stores to find 
who charges how much for which item and then report back on your own 
Web site. Price comparison sites work really well if you can exactly identify 
what you want to buy. For books, consumer electronics, computers, and 
computer parts, it’s always worth a look. But if you’re looking for khaki pants, 
no two pairs are the same, and most of us would rather pay an extra ten 
bucks to avoid a pair that makes us look like a spandex-wrapped potato.
Comparison sites now work two ways. One is to visit store sites and “scrape” 
the prices. The other is to make a deal with interested stores and let them 
upload their prices directly, typically in return for a commission when users 
click through. Both methods work okay, but we have occasionally seen com­
parison sites showing different prices from the ones you see if you visit the 
store site directly. Here are a few of our favorites:
	
✓	Google Product Search (www.google.com/products) is the latest 
incarnation of the Google price-comparison site that was originally 
named Froogle. Stores upload prices, but Google doesn’t charge them. 
(The search pages have ads on the right.) The searching is helpful, but 
the inventory is spotty.
	
✓	ISBN.NU (isbn.nu) checks prices for new books at a dozen online 
stores and tells you which one has the best price. The site scrapes the 
prices and then uses the stores’ affiliate programs to get paid.
	
✓	MySimon (www.mysimon.com) compares prices from a wide variety 
of online stores, finding its information about high-tech products from 
CNET and about nontechnical products from Shopping.com.
	
✓	Nextag (www.nextag.com) also covers a wide range of products, but 
we would decline their offer to help you shop for online degrees.
	
✓	Pricegrabber (www.pricegrabber.com) has good coverage of every­
thing from musical instruments to computer parts.

Up, Up, and Away
We buy lots of airline tickets online. Although the online travel sites aren’t 
as good as the very best human travel agents, the sites are now better than 
most agents and vastly better than bad travel agents. Even if you have a good 
agent, online sites let you look around to see your options before you get on 
the phone. Some airlines offer on their own Web sites some cheap fares that 
aren’t available any other way. The airlines know that it costs them much 
less to let the Web do the work, and they pay you (in the form of a hefty dis­
count) to use the Web.
The theory of airline tickets
Three giant airline computer systems in the United States — Sabre, Galileo/
Worldspan (two formerly separate systems that are merging), and Amadeus — 
handle nearly all airline reservations in the United States. (The sites are known 
as CRSs, or computer reservations systems, or GDS, for Global Distribution 
System.) Although each airline has a “home” GDS, the systems are all interlinked 
so that you can, with few exceptions, buy tickets for any airline from any GDS. 
Some low-price, start-up airlines are available by way of GDS, and others — 
notably, Southwest and Jet Blue — don’t participate in any of these systems but 
have instead their own Web sites, where you can check flights and buy tickets.
In theory, all the systems show the same data; in practice, however, they get 
a little out of sync with each other. If you’re looking for seats on a sold-out 
flight, an airline’s home system is most likely to have that last, elusive seat. 
If you’re looking for the lowest fare to somewhere, check all four systems 
(using different travel Web sites) because a fare that’s marked as sold out 
on one system often mysteriously reappears on another system. Also check 
Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) which has direct-connect access to many airlines, 
bypassing GDS altogether.
Some fare categories are visible only to travel agents and don’t appear on any 
Web sites, particularly if you aren’t staying over a weekend, so check with a 
good agent before buying. On the other hand, many airlines offer some spe­
cial deals that are only on their Web sites and that agents often don’t know 
about. Confused? You should be. We were.

172
Part III: Web Mania 
The confusion is even worse if you want to fly internationally. Official fares 
to most countries are set by way of the IATA cartel, so computer systems 
usually list IATA fares for only international flights. If you need to buy tickets 
sooner than a month ahead, you can often find entirely legal consolidator tick­
ets for considerably less than the official price, so an online or offline agent 
is extremely useful for finding the best price. International airlines also have 
some impressive online offers, most notably from Cathay Pacific, which usu­
ally has a pass that includes a ticket from the United States to Hong Kong and 
then unlimited travel all over Asia.
Here’s our distilled wisdom about buying tickets online:
	
✓	Check the online systems to see which flights are available and the 
range of prices. Check sites that use different GDSs. (We list some sites 
at the end of this section.)
	
✓	After you find a likely airline, check that airline’s site to see whether it 
has any special Web-only deals. If a low-fare airline flies the route, be 
sure to check that one, too.
	
✓	Check prices on flights serving all nearby airports. An extra 45 minutes 
of driving time can save you hundreds of dollars.
	
✓	Check with a travel agent (by phone, e-mail, or the agent’s Web site) to 
see whether he can beat the online price, and buy your tickets from the 
agent unless the online deal is better.
	
✓	For international tickets, do everything in this list and check both online 
and with your agent for consolidator tickets, particularly if you don’t 
qualify for the lowest published fare. For complex international trips, 
such as around the world, agents can invariably find routes and prices 
that the automated systems can’t.
	
✓	If you bid on airline tickets at a travel auction Web site, make sure that 
you already know the price at which you can buy the ticket so that you 
don’t bid more.
	
Before looking at online agents, check out ITA Software (www.itasoftware.
com). This company produces the fare search engine used by Orbitz and many 
airline sites. ITA’s own site has a version that just searches and doesn’t try to 
sell you any tickets, with more search options than most of its clients offer.
If you hate flying or would rather take the train, Amtrak and VIA Rail Canada 
offer online reservations (at www.amtrak.com and www.viarail.ca). 
If you’re visiting Europe, you can buy your Eurailpass online at www.
raileurope.com or check schedules and fares for most European railways 
at the German railways site at www.db.de (click the small English link near 
the right center).

Even More Places to Shop
Here are a few other places for you to shop on the Web. We have even 
bought stuff from most of them.
Auctions and used stuff
You can participate in online auctions of everything from computers and 
computer parts to antiques to vacation packages. Online auctions resemble 
any other kind of auction in at least one respect: If you know what you’re 
looking for and know what it’s worth, you can find some decent values; if you 
don’t, you can easily overpay for junk. When someone swiped our car phone 
handset, at eBay we found an exact replacement phone for $31, rather than 
the $150 the manufacturer charged for just the handset.

Many auctions — notably, eBay (as shown in Figure 10-3) — also allow you 
to list your own stuff for sale, which can be a way to get rid of some of your 
household clutter a little more discreetly than in a yard sale. The PayPal ser­
vice (www.paypal.com), now owned by eBay, lets you accept credit card 
payment from the highest bidder by e-mail. (See Chapter 11 for more informa­
tion about PayPal.)
Online auction sites include
	
✓	eBay (www.ebay.com): This auction site is the most popular one on the 
Web, and people flock there to sell all sorts of stuff, from baby clothes and 
toys to computer parts to cars to the occasional tropical island. You can 
sell stuff, too, by registering as a seller. eBay charges a small commission 
for auctions, which the seller pays. Searching the completed auctions at 
eBay is also a terrific way to find out how much an item is worth — you 
can see what people end up paying for items. If you’re thinking of selling 
that rare Beanie Baby, search the completed auctions for the bad news 
that it’s worth slightly less than it was when it was new.
	
✓	Half.com (www.half.com): This division of eBay is more like a consign­
ment shop than an auction. Sellers list used items they want to sell at 
a fixed price, such as books (including textbooks), CDs, movies, video 
games, electronic equipment, and trading cards. eBay keeps saying that 
it’ll merge this site into its main eBay site, but it never does.
	
✓	Priceline.com (www.priceline.com): This site sells airline tickets, 
hotel rooms, rental cars, and a grab bag of other items. Mostly like 
anyone else, you tell it what you want and it tells you the price. It still 
also has its famous reverse auction where you can specify a price for 
what you want and Priceline then accepts or rejects it.
Books, music, and more
You can’t flip through the books in an online bookstore as easily as you can 
in person (although Amazon.com comes close by offering a selection of pages 
from many books). However, if you know what you want, you can get good 
deals.
Here are some top sites:
	
✓	AbeBooks: This site, formerly Advanced Book Exchange, offers the 
combined catalogs of thousands of secondhand booksellers at www.
abebooks.com. You pay the same as you would in a used-book shop 
(plus shipping, of course), and you save hours of searching. Whether 
you’re looking for a favorite book from your childhood or a rare, first-
edition For Dummies book, this site is worth visiting.

Figure 10-3: 
You can find 
just about

✓	AddALL: AddALL (www.addall.com) is another good used-book site 
offering titles from thousands of used-book stores as well as a price-
comparison service for new books.
	
✓	Amazon.com: One of the great online-commerce success stories (at 
www.amazon.com) sprang up from nothing — if you call several million 
dollars of seed money nothing — to become one of the Net’s biggest 
online stores. Amazon.com has an enormous catalog of books and CDs 
and a growing variety of other junk, much of which can get to you in a 
few days. It also has an affiliates program in which other Web sites can 
refer you to their favorite books for sale at Amazon, creating sort of a 
virtual virtual-bookstore. Amazon sells most books at less than list price, 
and in most cases also has used copies from independent sellers. It also 
has DVDs and used books and just about everything else from pogo 
sticks to underwear.
	
✓	Barnes and Noble: Barnes & Noble (www.bn.com) is the biggest book­
store chain in the United States, and its online bookstore is big, com­
plete, and well done. You can even return online purchases at any of its 
stores. It also has a large selection of music.
	
✓	J&R Music World (www.jr.com): The online presence of one of New 
York’s largest music stores has a huge selection of music CDs. You can 
also buy a stereo to listen to your new CDs and a refrigerator to keep 
appropriate beverages at hand.

176
Part III: Web Mania 
	
✓	Powell’s Books: The country’s largest independent (nonchain) book­
store has a correspondingly large Web site (www.powellbooks.com) 
offering new and used books. We like its e-mail newsletter with new and 
rediscovered books and author interviews.
Clothes
This section points out a few familiar clothing merchants with online stores. 
Directories such as Open Directory Project (ODP, at www.dmoz.org) and 
Yahoo! (at dir.yahoo.com) have hundreds of other stores both familiar and 
obscure:
	
✓	Lands’ End: Most of this catalog is online (www.landsend.com), and 
you can order anything you find in any of its individual printed catalogs 
along with online-only discounted overstocks. It also has plenty of the 
folksy blather that encourages you to think of the company in terms of 
a few folks in the cornfields of Wisconsin rather than a corporate mail-
order colossus belonging to Sears Roebuck. (It’s both.)
	
✓	REI: This large sports-equipment and outdoor-wear co-op is headquar­
tered in Seattle. Members get a small rebate on purchases. The whole 
catalog is online (www.rei.com), and you can find occasional online 
specials and discounts.
	
✓	Eddie Bauer: This site (www.eddiebauer.com) has way more stuff 
than is available in its stores. (John gave up on the stores about the 
third time they said, “Oh, you have to order that from the Web site.”)
	
✓	The Gap: This site (www.gap.com) has the same stuff you find in its 
stores, but for people of unusual vertical or horizontal dimension, it 
also has jeans in sizes the stores don’t stock, as well as links to Banana 
Republic and Old Navy, its upscale and downscale divisions.
Computers
When you’re shopping for computer hardware online, be sure that the 
vendor you’re considering offers both a good return policy (in case the com­
puter doesn’t work when it arrives) and a long warranty.
Here are a few well-known vendors:
	
✓	Apple Computer: The Apple site (store.apple.com) has lots of infor­
mation about Macintosh computers, and now it offers online purchasing 
of iPods and iPhones, too.

177
 Chapter 10: More Shopping, Less Dropping
	
✓	Best Buy: This site (www.bestbuy.com) is the online version of the 
ubiquitous big-box store. Orders can be shipped, or you can pick them 
up at your local store.
	
✓	CDW: CDW (www.cdw.com) has a good selection of hardware and soft­
ware, and we’ve found it to be reliable.
	
✓	Dell Computers: This site has an extensive catalog with online ordering 
and custom computer system configurations (www.dell.com).
	
✓	PC Connection and Mac Connection: For computer hardware, software, 
and accessories, PC and Mac Connection (www.pcconnection.com 
and www.macconnection.com) is one of the oldest and most reliable 
online computer retailers. And, you can get overnight delivery within 
the continental United States even if you order as late as 2 a.m.!
Food
To show the range of edibles available online, here are some of our favorite 
places to point, click, and chow down:
	
✓	Cabot Creamery: This site (www.cabotcheese.coop) sells some of the 
best cheddar in Vermont. (Don’t tell anyone that a lot of the milk comes 
from New York.)
	
✓	Bobolink Dairy: A recovering software nerd and his family in rural New 
Jersey make and sell their own cheese — a rich, gooey, French-style 
cheese. Its URL (www.cowsoutside.com) refers to cows out in the pas­
ture rather than tied up in the barn.
	
✓	Gimme Coffee: This site (www.gimmecoffee.com) features highly opin­
ionated coffee from the wilds of upstate New York. Gimme Coffee has 
online orders and lots of advice on what to do with your coffee after it 
arrives; follow the Gimme Locations link to find pictures of the place John 
goes when he’s in need of literary inspiration, also known as caffeine.
	
✓	Gaspar’s (www.linguica.com): If you weren’t aware that Portuguese 
garlic sausage is one of the four basic food groups, this site will fix that 
problem. Oddly, online orders incur steep shipping charges, but phone or 
fax orders are shipped free, so we print and fax the order form. Also check 
out the competition at www.amarals.com and www.furtados.com.
	
✓	The Kitchen Link: Search this site (www.kitchenlink.com) for the 
perfect recipe and then shop for the ingredients.
	
✓	Peapod: Peapod (www.peapod.com) lets you shop for groceries online 
and then delivers them to your home. You have to live in an area that 
the parent grocery chains serve — the northeast and the Chicago area. 
If you live somewhere else, Netgrocer (www.netgrocer.com) delivers 
nonperishables by rather pricey overnight express, and perishables in a 
limited area near its New Jersey headquarters.

An online shopper’s checklist
Here are some questions to keep in mind when 
you’re shopping online. Astute shoppers will 
notice that these questions are the same ones 
to keep in mind wherever you’re shopping:
	✓	Are the descriptions clear enough to know 
what you’re ordering?
	✓	Are the prices competitive, with other 
online stores and with mail-order and regu­
lar retail?
	✓	Does the store have the products in stock, 
or does it offer a firm shipping date?
	✓	Does the store have a good reputation?
	✓	Does the store have a clearly written pri­
vacy policy that limits what it can do with 
the data it collects from you?
	✓	Can you ask questions about your order?
	✓	How can you return unsatisfactory goods?

O
nce upon a time, money was substantial stuff that glinted in the sun and 
clinked when you dropped it on the table. Investments were engraved 
certificates that you kept in your safe-deposit box if they worked out, and 
used as bathroom wallpaper if they didn’t. Well, that was then. Now, money 
and investments are mere electronic blips scampering from computer to 
computer, and if you do any banking or investing, one of the computers they 
scamper through might as well be yours.
You can do just about any banking online that doesn’t require physically han­
dling pieces of paper, which means everything except depositing checks and 
withdrawing cash. For those tasks, you have to use an ATM or, if you’re truly 
retro, physically visit a bank branch and talk to a human being. But we help 
you avoid that last option as much as possible.
Going to the Bank without 
Ever Leaving Home
Nearly every bank in the country now offers online banking. They don’t do it 
to be cool; they do it because online banking is vastly cheaper for them than 

180
Part III: Web Mania 
ATMs or tellers. Because both you and your bank have a strong interest in 
making sure that the person messing around online with your accounts is 
you, the sign-up process is usually a bit complicated — the bank either calls 
you to verify that you signed up or mails you a paper letter specifying your 
password. After you’re signed up, you visit the bank’s Web site and log in 
with your new user name or number and password. Each bank’s Web site is 
different, but they all show you an account statement along the lines of the 
one from John’s bank, shown in Figure 11-1.
	
Figure 11-1: 
A week of 
bank action, 
give or 
take a few 
details.
	
As you can see, deposits and withdrawals look like they do on printed state­
ments you receive in the mail. If you click the View Image link next to a 
check number, it shows you a picture of the canceled check. The Automated 
Clearing House, or ACH, lines are described in the nearby sidebar “ACH! It’s 
better than a check!”
If you use an accounting program such as Quicken or Microsoft Money, 
banks invariably offer a way to download your account info into your pro­
gram. Look for a link labeled Download or Export. In Figure 11-1, it’s the small 
Export History button, near the upper left corner.
Details differ, but beyond the capability to check your statement, banks all 
offer roughly the same services, including transfers and bill-paying.

181
 Chapter 11: Banking, Bill Paying, and Investing Online
Transferring money between 
bank accounts
If you have more than one account at a bank, a checking and savings account, 
some CDs, or a mortgage, you can usually move money from one account 
to another. In the account shown earlier, in Figure 11-1, the line that says 
Internet Banking Transfer indicates that money has been transferred from 
the checking account to a mortgage account, to make the monthly mortgage 
payment. To get a better idea of how this transaction works, here are the 
steps for transferring money from a checking account to a mortgage account 
(again, specific steps vary among banks):
	
1.	Click the Transfer button (or whatever your bank’s Web site calls it).
	
2.	Enter the amount you want to transfer in the box labeled Amount (or 
similar wording).
ACH! It’s better than a check!
For the past 150 years or so, the usual way to 
move money from one person’s account at a 
bank to a second person’s account at another 
bank has been for the first person to write a 
check and give it to the second person, who 
takes it to her bank and deposits it. (At least, 
that’s the system in the United States — in 
Europe, the first person writes out a bank trans­
fer and gives it to his bank to set up the pay­
ment.) Now that we’re in the computer age, we 
have a high-tech replacement for this process: 
ACH transfers.
Automated Clearing House, or ACH, transfers 
can do anything a check can do. Rather than 
print payroll checks, companies can use ACH 
to deposit money directly into employees’ bank 
accounts. The U.S. government uses ACH to 
make Social Security payments. You can use 
ACH to pay bills or to move money between 
accounts at different banks. For most purposes, 
ACH transactions are better than paper checks 
because they’re faster and more reliable.
To identify the account to use for an ACH trans­
fer, you need to provide the routing number that 
identifies the bank and the account number at 
that bank. The easiest way to find the rout­
ing number for your own checking account 
is to look at the line of funny-looking numbers 
printed along the bottom of one of your checks. 
The routing number consists of nine digits, 
usually printed at the left end of the line. The 
account number also appears on that line, and 
a check number (which ACH doesn’t use) may 
appear, too. Savings accounts also work for 
ACH transfers; to find the routing number, look 
at a check from the same bank or call the bank 
and ask.
You may be wondering, “Can anyone who 
knows my account number suck money from 
my account by using ACH?” Yes, but when you 
receive your statement, you can challenge any 
bogus ACH transaction just as you can chal­
lenge a forged check and get your money back. 
In practice, ACH is safe and reliable, and we 
use it for our own accounts all the time.

182
Part III: Web Mania 
	
3.	Select the account that the transferred money is coming from, gener­
ally from a list of possible From accounts.
	
4.	Select the account number that the transferred money is going to, 
­generally from a list of possible To accounts.
	
5.	Click the button labeled Transfer or Do It (or similar wording) — it’s 
done.
It’s that easy. Most banks handle transfers within the bank the same day; at 
John’s bank, you can enter a transfer as late as 7 p.m., which is handy when 
you remember at dinnertime that the mortgage is due today.
Many banks also let you make transfers to and from accounts at other banks, 
using ACH. To set up the transfers, you provide the other bank’s routing code 
and account number. Depending on the bank, it may require you to provide 
a voided check from that account, verify that the account name is the same 
as your account name, or make a couple of tiny deposits into the account 
and ask you how much they were. After you set up a transfer, it resembles a 
transfer within your own bank: You specify the accounts and the amount and 
then click. You can also transfer money between your bank and your mutual 
fund or brokerage account. In Figure 11-1, for example, the ACH deposits 
from ING Direct are from another bank, and the ACH deposit from VGI-ST 
TRSY is from a Vanguard mutual fund.
	
Transfers to other banks have two important differences: time and price. Even 
though the transfer is handled entirely electronically, it takes anywhere from 
two days to a week for the money to show up at the other end, depending on 
the other bank. The time it takes for any particular bank is consistent, so if the 
transaction took three days the last time, expect it to take three days the next 
time. If you must have the money available so that you can write checks on 
it, allow a week and keep an eye on your balances until you’ve made enough 
transfers to know how long they take.
The price for transfers varies from zero to two bucks, with no consistency 
among banks. A transfer can be started from either the sending (push) or 
receiving (pull) end; often, Bank A charges you a dollar if you tell it to send 
money to Bank B, but if (instead) you tell Bank B to receive exactly the same 
amount of money from Bank A, it’s free. All else being equal, pushing gets the 
money there faster.
	
You can use PayPal to move money from just about any bank account to any 
other bank account for free. It’s a handy way to make online transfers (and we 
describe it later in this chapter).

183
 Chapter 11: Banking, Bill Paying, and Investing Online
Paying bills online
Writing checks is so 20th century. Now you can pay most of your bills online. In 
many cases, you can arrange for automatic payments from your bank account 
for routine monthly bills. (In Figure 11-1, Bank America refers to the MasterCard 
bill.) We’ve arranged for payments for credit cards, the electric and gas com­
panies, and mobile phones — a typical mix. Most banks offer a bill-pay service, 
using one of a handful of specialized companies in this field. Some banks provide 
bill-pay for free, some charge, and some provide it for free as part of a package. 
Even if your bank doesn’t offer bill-pay, utility and credit card companies often 
can arrange for you to pay their bills automatically from your checking account.
Each of these companies has its own procedure. We use a credit card exam­
ple to show how this process usually works. Figure 11-2 shows the online 
payment page at American Express. When logged in to its Web site, you set 
up payments by entering for your bank account the routing code and account 
number that ACH needs. (See the preceding sidebar, “ACH! It’s better than a 
check!”) After the payment info is set up, you visit the Web site and specify 
how much you want to pay and when, and the bill is paid from your bank 
account. Usually, you get credit the same day, which is a big help to avoid 
paying credit card interest when you remember at the last minute that the 
bill is due. Some cards, including American Express, also offer the option to 
pay every month automatically on the due date, just the thing for thrifty card 
users who pay off the bills every month.
	
Figure 11-2: 
Pay your 
credit card 
bill with one 
click.
	

184
Part III: Web Mania 
Figure 11-3 shows the bill payment service from John’s bank. To set it up, 
you pick the companies to pay and then enter your account number and the 
name and address of the company if the bank doesn’t already have it on file. 
Some bill-pay systems offer the option of electronic presentment, in which you 
see your bill on the Web rather than receive it by paper mail. You also tell the 
system which bank account you want to pay the bills from. Then, to pay your 
bills each month, you just visit the bank’s Web site and enter the amounts 
to pay and the date. The bank automatically moves the money out of your 
account on the date for each payment. Some banks offer recurring payments 
so that you can tell it to pay the same amount every month.
If the payment service knows the payee’s bank account info, it uses ACH to 
pay. Otherwise, the service prints an old-fashioned paper check and mails it.
Taking advantage of other 
online bank services
Because doing business over the Web is much cheaper than doing it in 
person, banks are putting all sorts of other services online. Visit your bank’s 
Web site to see what it offers. Some of the services we’ve seen offered are
How safe are these banks, anyway?
When you open a bank account in person, you 
visit the bank and then look around to see that 
the bank looks like a bank, with tellers, people in 
suits, and a vault, which is good — or, you see 
a couple of people in a Winnebago with card 
tables and some money in cooler chests, which 
is bad. When you visit a bank’s Web site, it’s 
hard to tell a good one from a bad one. But it’s 
not hard to do a little research.
Every real bank in the United States is a member 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC). The FDIC has a nice-looking Web site 
at www.fdic.gov that has, among other 
things, detailed reports on each member bank. 
On the home page, click the Deposit Insurance 
link near the upper left corner, and then click 
Bank Find, at the top of the list. On that page, 
you can search by name or location. For exam­
ple, to check out ING Bank, enter its full name 
(ING bank, fsb, as it says on its home page) and 
search. (For this particular bank, an alterna­
tive route to the same information is to click 
the FDIC icon on the bank’s home page.) Either 
way, you see a reassuring page indicating that 
yes, it’s insured. For more info, click Financial 
Information to see the bank’s latest balance 
sheets. In this case, it says that the bank has 
$68 billion in assets and $5.7 billion in capital. 
Sounds like a bank to us.
Credit unions (joining one isn’t a bad idea if 
you’re eligible) are insured by the National 
Credit Union Association at www.ncua.gov. 
You can search for the name of your credit 
union to check its status.

Checking out a few recommended banks
These days, any bank you pass while driving down the street offers online 
banking, but some specialist banks do everything online. Although it’s pos­
sible to do all your banking online, we prefer to have our main account at a 
local bank, where we can drop by and argue with the staff, and use an online 
bank for a high-interest savings account that you can’t get at a local bank.
To give you a flavor of what’s available, here are two banks we use and 
recommend:
	
✓	HSBC Direct: A British bank that is, by some measures, the largest bank 
in the world (www.us.hsbc.com)
	
✓	ING Direct, www.ingdirect.com: A large Dutch bank also with subsid­
iaries all over the world (not as large as HSBC, but still big)

186
Part III: Web Mania 
Both have U.S. subsidiaries that offer online accounts with better interest 
rates than most competitors and no minimum balances. HSBC has lots of 
physical offices, but for the high-interest online account, you have to sign up 
online. ING has an office in Wilmington, Delaware, that we walked past one 
time, but we didn’t see any reason to go in.
To open an account at either bank, you fill out a form on its Web site, includ­
ing the ACH info about your existing checking account to link to your new 
HSBC or ING account. After it’s set up, you can move money back and forth 
between the accounts as needed. (Money you put into your ING account has 
to stay there for a week before you can get it back. The HSBC account limits 
you to six withdrawals per month. Accounts at other banks have similar 
rules.) Both also offer checkless checking accounts, certificates of deposit, 
mortgages, home equity loans, and retirement accounts. HSBC, a full-service 
bank, offers everything else a bank offers, all available online if you want it.
We’ve used both these banks quite happily, but we give the nod to HSBC 
because it pays slightly more interest and gives you an ATM card you can use 
for withdrawals anywhere and deposits at HSBC branches. If you travel a lot, 
you pay no withdrawal fee at any HSBC machine anywhere in the world.
Trying out combo banking
If you have an account with a stockbroker, such as the ones we list later in 
this chapter, it generally offers a check-writing option, which makes it act like 
a checking account, usually at very low cost. If you don’t have a local bank 
you like, this option can be a good one.
Dealing with Credit Cards
Just about every credit card in the country offers online access for the same 
reason that bank accounts do — online transactions are a lot cheaper for 
them than calls to the 800 number.
Online credit card services start with applying for the card. Search Google for 
credit cards, and you find a phantasmagoria of offers. They change daily, but 
you can look for various goodies — no annual fee, bonuses and rebates, and 
low interest rates. Most of the sites that appear to compare cards are in fact 
selling one bank’s cards, so treat their claims of unique and superior features 
with skepticism.

187
 Chapter 11: Banking, Bill Paying, and Investing Online
After you have your card, typical online conveniences include these:
	
✓	Check your balance and recent transactions.
	
✓	Pay your bill from your checking account.
	
✓	Apply for a credit line increase.
	
✓	Ask for copies of sales slips for charges you don’t recognize, or chal­
lenge ones you think are bogus.
	
✓	Download account information into Quicken and other personal finance 
programs.
	
✓	Manage rebate and bonus programs related to the cards.
Different credit-card-issuing banks have somewhat different versions of 
these services, but it’s difficult to compare them without getting the credit 
card first. For example, some banks let you set up automatic payments to 
pay each bill in full on the due date, getting the maximum use of your money 
without paying interest. At others, you have to visit their Web sites each 
month to schedule the month’s payment. Some have single-use card num­
bers, some don’t. We would make a list of features, but it would be out of 
date before it was printed, so visit some bank Web sites to see what they’re 
offering. (We compared two different banks in the tenth edition of this book, 
but then they merged, keeping the worst features of each. Sigh.)
Pay Your Pals with PayPal
Credit cards are easy to use — if you’re spending money. Until recently, it has 
been all but impossible for individuals (rather than companies) to receive 
payments by credit card. Even small businesses found it expensive and time 
consuming to accept credit card payments. PayPal (www.paypal.com) 
has changed all that, and also provides an easy way to move money among 
accounts at different banks.
PayPal is a boon to individuals who sell at auction sites like eBay (which owns 
PayPal), but it has many other uses, too. PayPal makes it easy to start a small 
business on the Web: Small organizations can use PayPal to collect payments for 
events such as dinners and amateur theater, nonprofits can accept donations, 
and it’s just about the only way to make payments to individuals in other coun­
tries without paying a service charge larger than the amount you’re paying.

188
Part III: Web Mania 
	
If you plan to accept PayPal for your business, be sure to heed PayPal’s warn­
ings regarding shipping only to verified buyer addresses. Be sure to comply 
carefully with all the fine print to protect yourself against fraud. Most first-
time sellers learn the hard way that it’s they who pay the cost of fraud — and 
even the cost of their customers’ innocent errors. The PayPal fraud rate is 
lower than that of most credit card fraud, but it’s a case of merchant beware — 
know your customer and take appropriate steps to safeguard your transactions.
PayPal offers the following services, but you have to observe a few rules:
	
✓	To send money, you have to have a PayPal account. An account is easy 
(and free) to open.
	
✓	After you open an account, you can send money to anyone who can 
receive e-mail. If that person doesn’t already have a PayPal account, she 
opens one when “cashing” your e-mail. The money you send can come 
from the balance in your PayPal account or from a bank account or 
credit card that you link to your PayPal account.
	
✓	After you have money in your account, you can use it to pay other 
people, move it to your linked bank account, or spend it with a debit 
card linked to your PayPal account.
	
✓	Individual accounts are free, but there are limits on the size and type of 
payments you can accept. The limits for payments from bank accounts 
tend to be higher than those from credit cards.
	
✓	Check the list of fees carefully. Payments marked Personal are generally 
free. Everything else has about a 3 percent fee.
	
✓	Premier accounts have a much higher limit on accepting payments, but 
are charged a fee on each payment they receive.
The folks at PayPal encourage you to provide them with your bank account 
number so that when you pay somebody, PayPal can take the money directly. 
That way, they don’t have to pay the credit card companies, and you can 
move any money you receive into your account with minimum hassle.
	
Be careful about giving your bank-account information to anyone. A variety of 
criminals send out huge numbers of notices, claiming to be from PayPal and 
claiming that you “must” provide them with your account number and password 
right away to clear up an account problem. Don’t fall for it. PayPal will never ask 
you for your password or account information in an e-mail message — or any­
where other than on its Web site (at https://www.paypal.com).
When you first tell PayPal to link your account to a bank account, PayPal 
verifies your bank account number by making two random deposits of less 
than a dollar. You then have to tell it the amount of the deposits to complete 
your registration. You can link several bank accounts to your PayPal account 
and then move money out of one account into PayPal, wait a few days for the 
transaction to be complete, and then move the money out of PayPal and into 
a different account — all for free.

 Chapter 11: Banking, Bill Paying, and Investing Online
	
If you leave money in your PayPal account, it pays interest at a decent rate — 
but because PayPal is not a bank, your money is safer in your bank account. 
(Most U.S. bank accounts are insured, whereas PayPal accounts are not.) We 
recommend that you only leave money in PayPal that you’re planning to use 
within a few days. If you’re fortunate enough to need to keep a significant bal­
ance in an online account, ING Direct and HSBC (described earlier in this chap­
ter) are real banks with deposit insurance and pay about the same as PayPal. 
Open an account at either one and then link your PayPal account to your 
HSBC or ING Direct account, as well as to your main bank account.
Investing Your Money Online
If you invest in mutual funds or the stock market (something that’s difficult to 
avoid these days unless you anticipate dying at an early age), you can find a 
remarkable range of resources online. An enormous amount of stock informa­
tion is also available, providing Net users with research resources as good as 
professional analysts had before the advent of online investing.
	
The most important thing to remember about all online financial resources is 
that everyone has an ax to grind — and wants to get paid somehow. In most 
cases, the situation is straightforward; for example, a mutual fund manager 
wants you to invest with her funds, and a stockbroker wants you to buy and 
sell stocks with him. Some other sites are less obvious: Some are supported 
by advertising, and others push certain special kinds of investments. Just 
consider the source (and any vested interests they may have in mind) when 
you’re considering that source’s advice.
Mutual funds
Mutual funds are definitely the investment of the baby boomer generation. 
The world now has more mutual funds than it has stocks for the funds to 
buy. (Kind of makes you wonder, doesn’t it?) Most fund managers have at 
least descriptions of the funds and prospectuses online, and many now pro­
vide online access so that you can check your account, move money from 
one fund to another within a fund group, and buy and sell funds — all with 
the money coming from and going to your bank account by way of ACH.
Well-known fund groups include
	
✓	American Century: A broad group of funds at www.american
century.com
	
✓	Fidelity Investments: The 500-pound gorilla of mutual funds; specializes 
in actively managed funds at www.fidelity.com

190
Part III: Web Mania 
	
✓	Vanguard Group: The other 500-pound gorilla; specializes in low-cost 
and index funds at www.vanguard.com
The online brokers listed in the following section also let you buy and sell 
mutual funds, although it almost always costs less if you deal directly with 
the fund manager.
Stockbrokers
Most well-known, full-service brokerage firms have jumped onto the Web, along 
with a new generation of low-cost online brokers that offer remarkably cheap 
stock trading. A trade that may cost $100 with a full-service firm can cost as little 
as $8 with a low-cost broker. The main difference is that the cheap firms don’t 
offer investment advice and don’t assign you to a specific broker. For people 
who do their own research and don’t want advice from a broker, the low-cost 
firms work well. For people who need some advice, the partial- or full-service 
firms often offer lower-cost trades online, and they let you get a complete view of 
your account whenever you want. The number of extra services the brokerages 
offer (such as retirement accounts, dividend reinvestment, and automatic trans­
fers to and from your checking account) varies widely.
Online brokers include
	
✓	Charles Schwab: The original discount broker (www.schwab.com) 
offers somewhat more investment help than E-Trade and TD Ameritrade, 
but at a slightly higher price. Kathleen Sindell, the author of Investing 
Online For Dummies, recommended this site to us.
	
✓	E-Trade: This low-cost, no-advice broker (www.etrade.com) also offers 
bank accounts, credit cards, boat loans, and just about every other 
financial service known to humankind.
	
✓	Smith Barney: This full-service broker (www.smithbarney.com) 
offers online access to accounts and research info. It’s a subsidiary of 
Citigroup, one of the largest banks in the world, which may or may not 
be a good thing.
	
✓	TD Ameritrade, www.tdameritrade.com: The low-cost, limited-advice 
broker, which is affiliated with Toronto-Dominion Bank, one of the larg­
est Canadian banks. It has good online research tools.
Most fund groups, including the ones in the preceding list, have brokerage 
departments — which can be a good choice if you want to hold both indi­
vidual stocks and funds.

 Chapter 11: Banking, Bill Paying, and Investing Online
Portfolio tracking
	
Several services let you track your portfolio online. You enter the number 
of shares of each fund and stock you own, and the service can tell you — at 
any time — exactly how much they’re worth and how much money you lost 
today. Some of them send by e-mail a daily portfolio report, if you want. These 
reports are handy if you have mutual funds from more than one group or both 
funds and stocks. All the tracking services are either supported by advertising 
or run by a brokerage that hopes to gain your trading business:
	
✓	Google Finance: (www.google.com/finance) offers multiple portfo­
lios with a minimalist Google style. Google is at the moment the only site 
that offers real-time as opposed to 20-minute delayed stock quotes, for 
people who think they can beat the market.
	
✓	MSN MoneyCentral: (moneycentral.msn.com) This service also has 
portfolios and lots of information, although we find it cumbersome to set 
up and more of a pain to use than My Yahoo!. To use all its features, you 
have to use Internet Explorer.
	
✓	Smart Money: (www.smartmoney.com) The online face of Smart Money 
magazine lets you track portfolios and read news stories. Although the 
site wants you to subscribe to the magazines, the free portfolio tracker 
isn’t bad.
	
✓	My Yahoo!: (my.yahoo.com) Enter multiple portfolios and custom­
ize your screens with related company and general news reports. You 
can also see lots of company and industry news, including some access 
to sites that otherwise require paid subscriptions. It’s advertiser sup­
ported, comprehensive, and easy to use. We stock market junkies par­
ticularly like the streaming updates that continually update stock values 
in flickers of red (bad) and green (good).
Budgeting Tools
Sites to help spend, pay, and invest your money are useful, assuming that 
you have money to spend, pay, and invest. Toward that end, some Web sites 
help you make and follow a budget. They link to your bank and credit card 
accounts so that they can track the money coming in and out and let you 
know how reality compares to your budget. We’ve found some significant 
bugs in the ones we’ve tried that made them misreport our financial situa­
tion, so check their numbers before you trust them. However, if your finances 
are simple (and all in one currency), these sites can be useful for categorizing 
your spending and comparing it to your budget. Here are two:

192
Part III: Web Mania 
	
✓	Mint.com tracks your budget against your bank accounts, with occa­
sional offers from their sponsors. It’s strong in budgeting tools, sug­
gestions about how your budget compares with its other million users, 
warnings of upcoming bills, and lots of pretty charts and graphs.
	
✓	Quicken.com is the online version of the popular Quicken personal 
finance package. The Web site isn’t as glitzy as Mint.com, but account 
setup is easier and the overall site is easier to use if you don’t want all 
the helpful Mint.com advice.
(Quicken has bought Mint.com, so these two sites may end up merging.)

Swiping Files from the Net
In This Chapter
▶	Using your Web browser to download files
▶	Downloading and viewing pictures
▶	Installing software you swiped from the Net
▶	Scanning downloaded files for purity and wholesomeness
▶	Downloading other types of files
T
he Internet is chock-full of computers, and those computers are chock-
full of files. What’s in those files? Programs, baby pictures, adult pictures, 
sounds, movies, documents, spreadsheets, recipes, Anne of Green Gables 
(the entire book and several of its sequels) — you name it. Some of the com­
puters are set up so that you can copy some of the files they contain to your 
own computer, usually for free. In this chapter, we tell you how to find some 
of those files and how to copy and use them.
What Is Downloading?
Downloading means copying files from a computer Up There On The Internet 
“down” to the computer sitting on or under your desk. Uploading is the 
reverse — copying a file from your computer “up” to a computer on the 
Internet.
You probably won’t be surprised to hear that you can download and upload 
files in three different ways:
	
✓	Click a link on a Web page. Web browsers can download files, too. In 
fact, they do it all time when they download Web pages so that you can 
see them.
	
✓	Participate in a file sharing service. Because these services are of dubi­
ous legality, and tend to install spyware on your computer, we don’t rec­
ommend them. File-sharing services include LimeWire and BitTorrent.

194
Part III: Web Mania 
	
✓	Run a file transfer program. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, an 
older (but still widely used) way that computers transfer files across the 
Internet.
You can also transfer files by attaching them to e-mail messages sent to other 
e-mail users, which we discuss in Chapter 13.
	
By far the easiest way to download files is by using your Web browser — clicking 
links is our favorite method of finding and downloading files.
How you download a file and what you do with it after you have it also 
depends on what’s in the file. This chapter describes how to download 
pictures, programs, and other files using your Web browser. If you want to 
download music and video, refer to Chapter 9.
Downloading Pictures
High-quality digitized pictures; a large fraction of all the bits flying around the 
Internet is made up of them. About 99.44 percent of the pictures are purely 
for fun, games, and worse. We’re sure that you’re in the 0.56 percent of users 
who need the pictures for work.
The most commonly used graphics formats on the Net are GIF, JPEG, and 
PNG. A nice feature of these file formats is that they do a fair job of compres­
sion internally, so quality is high even in files that aren’t too humongous.
Dozens of commercial and shareware programs on PCs and Macs can read 
and write graphics files. Firefox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer can 
display them as well; just choose File➪Open from the menu. The buttons and 
icons on Web pages are usually stored as GIF files, too.
To download a picture from the Web, follow these steps:
	
1.	Display the picture in your Web browser.
	
2.	Right-click the picture and choose Save Image As or Save Picture As 
from the menu that appears.
	
	 A small number of Web sites disable right-clicking pictures to prevent 
you from saving them. Oh, well!
	
3.	In the dialog box that appears, tell your browser where to save the 
picture on your computer.
	
	 You can choose the folder where you want to put it and the filename to use.
	
4.	Click Save.

195
 Chapter 12: Swiping Files from the Net
That’s all it takes!
	
Graphics files have special filename extensions that identify which graphics 
format the file is in. When you download a picture, you can change the name 
of the file, but don’t change the extension. Common extensions are GIF; JPEG 
or JPG; TIFF or TIF; and PNG.
Art Ain’t Free
As plentiful as art is on the Internet, consider this: Somebody had to work to 
create every one of those images. Some artists want to control what happens 
to their work, or even be paid for it. (What a concept.)
	
Just because a picture is on a Web page doesn’t mean that no one owns it. 
Nearly all graphics on Web pages are copyrighted, and it’s not legal to use the 
picture without getting permission from the copyright owner. No one will sue 
you for storing a picture on your computer (so far as we know — we’re not 
lawyers) but don’t plan on using downloaded graphics in your own Web site 
or publication without getting permission. Unless a picture comes from a site 
that specifically offers pictures as reusable clip art (art you can clip and use), 
you have to get permission to reuse the picture for most purposes — even to 
upload it to your own, noncommercial Web page.
To find clip art sources, search for clip art or clipart — and include a word 
or phrase describing what you need a picture of. Some of the images you’re 
shown are free, and some require a subscription or payment per picture. We 
like www.clipart.com, which requires a subscription fee but offers a moun­
tain of clip art and photos you can legally download and reuse.
Downloading Programs
Lots of the programs that this book recommends can be downloaded from 
the Web, often for free. This section describes the process for downloading 
programs and getting them running.
Sticking with the plan: Download, 
install, and run
When you download a program, you transfer a file from a computer on the 
Internet to your computer. But the program is still trapped inside the file — 
you usually need to take additional steps to let it out. The file you download 

196
Part III: Web Mania 
is usually an installation program, which you run to install the actual pro­
gram. While you’re at it, you’d be wise to scan the program for viruses before 
running it.
All these steps are described in the following pages — just keep reading!
Finding programs to download
The first step in downloading a program is to find it. In some cases, you 
already know the Web address where the file is available for download. 
For example, in Chapter 6 we recommend that you avoid Internet Explorer 
because it’s a target for viruses and spyware. (Chapter 2 describes what we 
mean by viruses and spyware.) We suggest that you switch to Firefox, which 
is a free download from the Web site www.mozilla.com, or Google Chrome, 
which you can download for free from chrome.google.com.
In other cases, you may hear about a program but not know where to find it. 
Google is your friend — search for the program’s name and you will probably 
find its source.
Another good source for downloadable programs is a software library, such 
as CNET at www.download.com (for freeware, described in the following 
sidebar, “Free and not-quite-free-ware”) and www.shareware.com (for 
shareware). Libraries include recommendations and reviews, and they scan 
their programs for viruses and other bad stuff.
Free and not-quite-free-ware
Some software is free — it’s freeware. 
Freeware is available for download for free 
with no strings attached. Firefox and Google 
Chrome are freeware, as are many of the pro­
grams at the TUCOWS software library at www.
tucows.com.
When the authors ask for donations if you like 
their programs — on the honor system — it’s 
shareware. You can download and install a 
program for free, just like freeware, but if you 
keep using it, you should make a donation to its 
author. (If you don’t, don’t expect the program 
to be updated in the long run!) The site from 
which you download shareware should specify 
the requested donation. You can usually also 
choose Help from the program’s menu to find 
out how to make a donation.
Some downloaded programs are trialware or 
crippleware, which are time-limited or other­
wise-limited versions of the program. You can 
use the downloaded program for free, but if you 
want the real, complete program, you need to 
pay for it. The program itself tells you its limita­
tions, its price, and how to pay. Some programs 
don’t limit their features, but they display ads 
unless you pay — a reasonable trade-off.

197
 Chapter 12: Swiping Files from the Net
	
Viruses and spyware can be contained in any program, so don’t run an execut­
able file unless you’re sure that you know what’s in it! Stick with the software 
libraries we recommend in this chapter because they scan their files for 
viruses and spyware. Or, download programs directly from the software orga­
nization. (For example, get Firefox from www.mozilla.com and Google soft­
ware from google.com.)
Downloading a program file
Before you start downloading, make a folder to store all your downloaded 
program files, like this:
	
✓	Windows 7 comes with a folder named Downloads. To open it, choose 
Start➪Documents and click Downloads.
	
✓	Windows Vista comes with a Downloads folder in your user folder.
	
✓	In Windows XP, to create a Downloads folder in My Documents, choose 
Start➪My Documents, choose File➪New➪Folder from the menu, and 
name the new folder Downloads.
	
✓	On a Mac, in Finder, open Places, your username, and Downloads.
Downloading a program file over the Web is easy:
	
1.	Click a link to the file, frequently a link that says either Download or 
the name of the program.
	
	 Your Web browser asks you what to do with the file. If it’s a program (in 
Windows, a file with the extension .exe) or a Zip file (with the exten­
sion .zip), the most reasonable thing for you to do is to save it in your 
Downloads folder and then install it at your leisure.
	
2.	Click Save.
	
	 Depending on which browser you use, downloading looks a little dif­
ferent. In Firefox, you may see a Downloads window that shows your 
progress. In Google Chrome, a message at the bottom of the window 
may appear and warn you that you’re downloading a program, and if 
you’re not sure that it’s a safe program, it could do a lot of damage. 
Assuming that you trust the source of the program, go ahead. Internet 
Explorer may block the download when it sees an executable file arriv­
ing; follow the directions to click the message and choose Download 
File. Sometimes, other download manager programs appear, too.
	
3.	When the download has finished, decide what to do next.
	
	 Your browser may display a message or window showing that the file is 
ready to install — read on.

198
Part III: Web Mania 
Scanning for Viruses
We warn you about viruses in Chapter 2 and encourage you in Chapter 4 to 
install a virus checker. Chapter 14 describes how to configure your virus checker 
and how to tell your e-mail program not to run programs you receive by e-mail. 
As you can tell, we take viruses seriously, and we think you should, too.
We all know that you practice safe software: You check every new program 
you get to make sure that it contains no hidden software viruses that may 
display obnoxious messages or trash your hard drive. If that’s true of you (no 
fibbing, now), you can skip this section.
The rest of you — make that all of us, these days — should run a virus-
scanning program at regular intervals and keep it updated. You never know 
what naughty piece of code you may otherwise unwittingly download to your 
defenseless computer!
	
Run your virus checker after you have obtained and run any new piece of soft­
ware. Although the Web and FTP servers on the Internet make every effort to 
keep their software archives virusfree, nobody is perfect.
Installing the program
Okay, now you have the downloaded program file and you know that it’s 
safe to proceed. However, most downloaded programs are still trapped in an 
installation file — they aren’t ready to use yet. For example, when you down­
load Firefox, you get a file with a name like Firefox Setup 3.5.2.exe. 
(The .exe at the end tells you that it’s a program; it’s short for executable.) 
That’s not Firefox; it’s the Firefox Setup program, which contains Firefox.
If you just downloaded the program file, your browser may be waiting breath­
lessly to install it:
	
✓	In Firefox, the Downloads window shows the filename, ready to click 
when the download is finished.
	
✓	In Google Chrome, the name of the file appears at the bottom of the 
Chrome window, along with a Show All Downloads link to see anything 
else you’ve downloaded recently.
	
✓	In IE, you see a Download Complete window with a Run button.

199
 Chapter 12: Swiping Files from the Net
If none of these buttons or windows is visible (maybe you’re getting around 
to installing the program a couple of days after downloading it), double-click 
the name of the setup program in My Computer or Finder. The file should 
open itself and walk you through a wizard-style set of windows to collect 
any needed setup info — and then install itself. If you’re using Windows 7 or 
Vista, a box pops up and asks whether you’re an administrator to complete 
the installation. If you’re sure that you trust the source of the program, click 
OK. The setup program probably creates an icon for the program on your 
desktop. In Windows, it may also add the program to your Start menu.
A small number of simple programs don’t come with an installation program — 
you just get the program itself, and after it’s unzipped, you need only run the 
program you extracted from the Zip file. To make the program easy to run, you 
need an icon for it. You can create your own icon or menu item for the program. 
In Windows, follow these steps:
	
1.	Run either My Computer or Windows Explorer and select the program 
file (the file with the extension .exe or occasionally .com or .msi).
	
2.	Use your right mouse button to drag the filename out on the desktop 
or into an open folder on the desktop.
	
	 An icon for the program appears.
Uncompressing and unzipping files
Most downloadable software on the Internet is 
in a compressed format to save storage space 
on the server and transmission time when 
you download the file. Most software is self-
installing — the file is (or contains) a program 
that does the necessary uncompressing and 
installing. Self-installing Windows files have the 
extension .exe or .msi, and non-self-install­
ing compressed files have the extension .zip.
To install a self-installing file, just double-click 
the file to run it — and skip to the later section 
“Installing the program.” If a file is compressed, 
you need a program to open and uncompress 
it. Files with the file extension .zip identify 
compressed files (these files are, amazingly, 
Zip files). If you use Windows 7, Vista, or XP or 
a modern Mac, they all pretend that Zip files 
are folders. Just double-click the Zip file to see 
what’s inside it. For older versions of Windows, 
programs such as WinZip (downloadable from 
www.winzip.com) can unzip and zip things 
for you. Users of older Macs may need the 
StuffIt program, from my.smithmicro.
com/mac.

200
Part III: Web Mania 
Another method is to choose Start➪Programs or Start➪All Programs, find the 
menu choice for the program, hold down the Shift key, drag the menu choice 
to the desktop, and release the Shift key. Windows copies the menu choice as 
an icon on the desktop.
To run your new program, you can just click or double-click the icon 
(depending on how you have Windows configured — try clicking first, and if 
nothing happens, double-click). Cool!
Configuring the program
Now you can run the program. Hooray!
You may have to tell the program, however, about your Internet address or 
your computer or who-knows-what before it can do its job. Refer to the text 
files (if any) that came with the program — or choose Help from the pro­
gram’s menu bar — to see more information about how to configure and run 
your new program. The Web site from which you got the program may have 
some explanations, too.
Downloading Other Types of Files
If you want to download almost any type of file — such as a Word document, 
a spreadsheet, or a database — you can follow these steps:
	
1.	Find the file on the Web.
	
	 Search the Web for it, as described in Chapter 8.
Downloading the old-fashioned way with FTP
Back before the Web was even invented, the 
Internet was up and running. (And yes, then-
Senator Al Gore was a major player in getting 
the funding that made the Internet possible.) 
When you wanted to download a file, you used 
an FTP program — File Transfer Protocol. You 
needed to know the name of the server on 
which the file was stored and in which folder 
it was stored.
If you want the retro FTP experience, see net.
gurus.org/ftp to read how FTP used to 
work — and still does.
Web browsers can download files by FTP 
automatically; if you see a URL that starts with 
ftp://, that’s an FTP download, which works 
just like any other Web download.

201
 Chapter 12: Swiping Files from the Net
	
2.	Follow the instructions on the Web page to download the file.
	
	 This step usually just means clicking a Download button.
	
3.	When your browser displays a Save or Save As dialog box, choose 
where to put the file.
	
	 If you have created a Downloads or Downloaded Files folder, put it 
there. Or, put it in the folder where you want the file to end up.
	
4.	Check the file for viruses.
	
	 See the section “Scanning for Viruses,” earlier in this chapter, for details.
	
5.	Unzip the file if necessary (which it usually isn’t).
	
	 If the file is large or you’re downloading a group of files, the file or files may 
be compressed into a Zip file. See the “Uncompressing and unzipping files” 
sidebar, earlier in this chapter, to find out how to uncompress the file.
	
6.	Open the file with its matching program.
	
	 If you downloaded a Word document, open it in Word (or, maybe 
OpenOffice, a nice freeware office suite you can download from www.
openoffice.org.) If you aren’t sure which kind of file you have, or 
which program opens it, display the filename in My Computer or Finder 
and double-click the filename. If you have a program installed that can 
open the file, your computer should run the program and open the file 
automatically.
Your files are ready to use!
Some File Types and What 
to Do with Them
The name of a file — in particular, its extension (the end of the name after the 
last period) — usually gives you a clue about the type of file it is. Although 
people usually try to be consistent and follow the conventions for filename 
extensions, file naming isn’t a sure thing. Windows uses the extension to 
specify which program to use to open a file, so you may sometimes have to 
rename a file to an extension that will persuade Windows to use the right 
program. For example, if you double-click a file with the extension DOC, 
Windows runs Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, or WordPad (which all are asso­
ciated with the DOC file extension) to open the file. If you rename a Word 
document to end with the extension GIF, Windows no longer knows that the 
file contains a document.
Hundreds of kinds of files exist, maybe thousands. Fortunately, they fall into 
some general categories:

202
Part III: Web Mania 
	
✓	Executable: Files you can execute, or run; in other words, programs. In 
Windows, these programs have the extension .exe or sometimes .msi. 
Executable programs are widely available for downloading for PCs and 
Macs; see the section “Downloading Programs,” earlier in this chapter, 
to find out how to install them safely.
	
✓	Compressed: Archives, Zip files, SIT files, and other compressed files, 
encoded in a special way that takes up less space but can be decoded 
only by the corresponding uncompressor. Windows compressed files end 
with ZIP and appear as compressed folders. Mac compressed files are 
decoded by using StuffIt. (See the sidebar “Uncompressing and unzip­
ping files,” earlier in this chapter.)
	
✓	Graphics: See “Downloading Pictures,” earlier in this chapter.
	
✓	Audio and video: Files that contain pictures and sounds encoded in com­
puter-readable form. Graphics files on Web pages are usually in GIF or JPEG 
format. Audio files can be in WAV (Windows audio), RAM (RealAudio), MP3 
(music), WMA (Windows Media Player), or other formats. Video files con­
tain digitized movies, in AVI, MPEG, or WMV format. Audio and video 
files — files that contain digitized sound and movies — can be found all 
over the Web, ranging from songs to radio shows to recorded books to 
full-length movies. For all kinds of music and video on the Web, refer to 
Chapter 9.
	
✓	Plain text: Files that contain text, believe it or not, with no formatting 
codes. Text files contain readable text with no word-processor-style 
formatting codes. (What did you expect?) Sometimes, the text is human-
readable text, such as the manuscript for the first edition of this book, 
which we typed into text files. Sometimes, the text is source code or 
data for computer programs. On PCs, text files usually have the file 
extension .txt (or no extension). You can look at these files by using 
Notepad, WordPad, or any word processor. Mac text files also often 
have the TXT file type. Read text files on a Macintosh with TextEdit or 
any word processor.
	
✓	PDF: Portable Document Format files (with the extension .pdf) are for­
matted documents, ready to view and print. The most popular program 
that displays and prints PDF files is Acrobat Reader. If your computer 
doesn’t already have it, you can download it from adobe.com/products/
acrobat. Several free or cheap PDF creators are now available; we rec­
ommend the Pdf995 Printer Driver, at www.pdf995.com. You usually 
can’t edit a PDF file, but when you print it, it looks great, and some PDFs 
are forms you can fill out and print. The IRS offers tax forms as PDFs at 
www.irs.gov/formspubs.
	
✓	Formatted text documents: Formatted text documents are frequently 
stored in Microsoft Word (DOC) or Rich Text Format (RTF) format. 
Unfortunately, different versions of Word store different types of DOC files; 
RTF is slightly more standard. OpenOffice Writer uses the extension .sxw. 
Most word processing software can recognize a competitor’s format and 

203
 Chapter 12: Swiping Files from the Net
make a valiant effort to convert the format to something usable so that 
you aren’t tempted to buy the other product. Windows comes with the 
WordPad program, which can open many Word documents.
	
✓	Entire books: You can download entire books and read them on 
your PC, reader (Amazon Kindle or Sony Reader), or smartphone. 
Unfortunately, too many competing formats for books exist. Books that 
are copyrighted usually have to be purchased, are copy-protected in 
some way, and need a special reader; for example, you can buy Kindle-
formatted books at Amazon.com and read them by using its Kindle 
Reader program. Books out of copyright (like the thousands of classics 
that you’ve been meaning to read) can be downloaded for free from 
Project Gutenberg, at gutenberg.org/catalog, in a variety of for­
mats. (Margy has downloaded War and Peace and hopes to finish read­
ing it on her iPhone before the year 2025. John is working on Ben-Hur.)
	
✓	Data: Any other type of file. You can handle Excel (.xls) and 
PowerPoint (.ppt) files similarly, by opening them in the application.

E-Mail, Chat, and 
Other Ways to Hang 
Out Online

In this part . . .
N
ow we turn to the part of the Internet that very 
slightly resembles talking on the phone because 
you’re talking (or typing) to other people. We start with 
e-mail, one of the oldest but still most useful Net services, 
for one-to-one conversations and discussions among 
larger e-mail communities. You’ll find advice about how to 
use e-mail and how to keep safe from e-mail-borne spam 
and viruses. We finish with faster-paced modern alterna­
tives, such as instant messages, online chat, Twitter, 
Internet phones, and the wild world of online gaming.

Receiving E-Mail

E
lectronic mail, or e-mail, is without a doubt the most popular Internet 
service, even though it’s one of the oldest and least glitzy. Although 
e-mail doesn’t have the flash and sparkle of the World Wide Web, more 
people use it. Every system on the Net supports some sort of mail service, 
which means that no matter what kind of computer you’re using, if it’s on the 
Internet, you can send and receive mail. Even some systems that aren’t tech­
nically on the Internet — think mobile phone — can do e-mail.
Regardless of which type of mail you’re using, the basic tasks of reading, 
sending, addressing, and filing mail work in much the same way, so skimming 
this chapter is worthwhile even if you’re not using any of the mail programs 
we describe here.
	
Young whippersnappers are alleged to think that e-mail is for old people, and 
that the cool way to send messages is by using text messages on their phones, 
instant messaging (covered in Chapter 16), or messages within Facebook or 
another social networking site. However, e-mail is still the way that businesses 
communicate with each other and with customers, and that most people send 
messages over the Internet. Not everyone is on Facebook, LinkedIn, or what­
ever the new Web site is, but almost everyone who has ever used the Internet 

208
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
has an e-mail address. Don’t worry: E-mail is still cool! (And anyway, nearly all 
those sites send you mail when someone sends you a message, so you just 
need to check your mail, not all umpteen Web sites, to see what’s new.)
What’s My Address?
Your e-mail address is the cyberspace equivalent of a postal address or a 
phone number. When you send an e-mail message, you type the addresses of 
the recipients so that the computer knows where to send it.
Before you can do much mailing, you have to figure out your e-mail address 
so that you can give it to people who want to get in touch with you. You also 
have to figure out some of their addresses so that you can write to them. (If 
you have no friends or plan to send only anonymous hate mail, you can skip 
this section.)
E-mail addresses have two parts, separated by an @ (the at-sign). The part 
before the @ is the username or mailbox, which is, roughly speaking, your 
personal name. The part after that is the domain.
The domain part
The domain (the part after the @) indicates where your mailbox is stored. 
Mailboxes usually live in one of four places:
	
✓	Your Internet service provider (ISP): If you sign up for a DSL account at 
Verizon, the domain is verizon.net. If you use AOL, it’s aol.com.
	
✓	Your school, employer, or other organization: If you attend Tufts 
University (Go, Jumbos!), the domain is tufts.edu. If you work for 
Microsoft, it’s microsoft.com.
	
✓	Your own domain, such as gurus.org: (That’s one of ours.) You can 
own your domain name, as described in Chapter 20. You need to arrange 
for your domain to live somewhere, which is probably where your mail­
boxes will be stored, too.
	
✓	A Web-based e-mail service, or webmail: If you don’t have an ISP (say, 
you connect from the public library), all is not lost. Years ago, some 
genius had the idea of creating a Web site where you can sign up for an 
e-mail account and then log in to read and send messages. Your e-mail 
mailbox lives on the Web site’s mail servers, and you use your browser, 
rather than a regular e-mail program, to read and send messages. Many 

209
 Chapter 13: It’s in the Mail: Sending and Receiving E-Mail
Web sites now provide free mailboxes — try one out at Google Gmail, 
www.gmail.com, Windows Live Hotmail (formerly just Hotmail) at 
mail.live.com, Yahoo! Mail at mail.yahoo.com, or AIM Mail at web­
mail.aol.com. See the later section “The Web Is a Fine Place to Read 
Your E-Mail” to find out how to sign up for a webmail account.
	
Even if your ISP or employer offers mailboxes, you may want to sign up for a 
webmail account. Some of us prefer to separate our work-related e-mail from 
our personal ones. Another advantage of webmail is that if you change ISPs, 
your e-mail address doesn’t change. When our local cable Internet company 
changed its domain from verizon.net to myfairpoint.com, all its custom­
ers had to let their friends know about their new e-mail address, and many 
chose to switch to a webmail address instead.
The username part
Your username is the name assigned to your particular mailbox. You can 
write to the president of the United States at president@whitehouse.gov, 
for example. The president’s username is president, and the domain that 
stores his mailbox is whitehouse.gov — reasonable enough.
If you’re lucky, you get to choose your username; in other cases, ISPs 
standardize usernames and you get what you get. You may choose (or be 
assigned) your first name as your username — or your last name, your ini­
tials, your first name and last initial, your first initial and last name, or a com­
pletely made-up name. At the major webmail sites, all obvious usernames 
have already been taken, so you may need to get creative, by adding num­
bers or other information to create a username that’s not already in use.
Many organizations assign usernames in a consistent format for all users, 
most often by using your first and last names with a dot (.) between them or 
your first initial followed by the first seven letters of your last name. In these 
schemes, your e-mail address may resemble elvis.presley@bluesuede.
org or epresley@bluesuede.org. (If your name isn’t Elvis Presley, adjust 
this example suitably. On the other hand, if your name is Elvis Presley, please 
contact us immediately. We know some people who are looking for you.)
When you sign up with an ISP, the provider creates a mailbox for each of 
your usernames. Although some ISPs offer only one username with each 
Internet account, many ISPs offer as many as five mailboxes with five differ­
ent usernames for a single account so that each person in your family can 
have a mailbox.

210
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
	
Don’t share an e-mail address with other people, unless they’re very close 
friends. Many Internet services use your e-mail address as your personal iden­
tifier, send a message to your address to confirm your identity, and assume 
that anyone with access to your account is you. Webmail addresses are free, 
so if you don’t already have your own e-mail address, get one.
Putting it all together
Whenever you set up a mail program, you need to enter information about 
your e-mail mailbox. People switch mail programs from time to time (new 
versions often come out with swell new features), so write in Table 13-1 your 
e-mail address and other info that your ISP, employer, or school or another 
e-mail provider gave you (and fold down the corner of this page so that you 
can find it again later). Capitalization never matters in domains and rarely 
matters in usernames. To make it easy on your eyes, therefore, most domain 
and mailbox names in this book are shown in lowercase. (Don’t worry about 
the parts of the table you don’t understand right away — we explain later in 
this chapter what servers are.)
Whaddaya mean you don’t know 
your own address?
It happens frequently — you know the e-mail 
address you requested for your new account, 
but you’re not absolutely positive that it was 
approved. Before you give out your address 
to everyone you know, test it out by sending a 
message to a friend or two. Tell them to reply 
to your message when they receive it and to let 
you know which address your message came 
from. Or, send yourself a message and use your 
e-mail login name as the mailbox name. Then 
examine the return address on the message.
Better yet, send a message to The Internet 
For Dummies Mail Central, at internet12@
gurus.org, and a friendly robot will send 
back a message with your address. (While 
you’re at it, tell us whether you like this book, 
because we authors read that mail and write 
back when time permits.) If you’re planning on 
testing your e-mail repeatedly and don’t care 
whether we read your message, send it to 
test@gurus.org.

Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
And I Would Read My Mail How?
How you read and send e-mail depends on which kind of e-mail account you 
have:
	
✓	Mailbox at your ISP or school or your own domain: Most ISPs expect 
you to use a mail program to read your e-mail — a program that dis­
plays incoming messages and allows you to send messages. You can 
use any of a long list of mail programs, including Thunderbird, Outlook, 
Windows Mail, Eudora, Mail.app, or Entourage, as well as mail programs 
on your smartphone. We talk about the most popular mail programs 
in the rest of this chapter. Most of these providers also have webmail 
options; see the next section.
	
✓	Corporate account: If you use e-mail at work, your organization may use 
a different type of mail server: Microsoft Exchange. In addition to provid­
ing mail services, Exchange also provides shared calendars, to-do lists, 
and other nifty features. The most popular program that works with all 
Exchange features is Microsoft Outlook, so your organization probably 
insists that you use it, despite its security flaws. To read about Outlook, 
see Outlook 2010 For Dummies by Bill Dyszel. Exchange provides a Web-
based system, too; see the next section.
	
✓	AOL: If you use an AOL account to connect to the Internet, you get as 
many as seven mailboxes as part of the AOL service. If you have a very 
large family, for example, you can sign up for as many free AOL email 
accounts as you like. You have three options for using AOL mail:
 
• The AOL e-mail program: Most people who connect to the Internet 
via AOL read and send e-mail from the same AOL program they use 
to connect to their account. Click the Read icon on the toolbar or 
any little mailbox icon you can find.
 
• Another mail program: You can use almost any Windows or Mac 
mail program. These mail programs tend to have better features 
for reading and filing messages than does AOL’s own software. We 
recommend that you use Thunderbird, which we describe later in 
this chapter.
 
• Your Web browser: Your third option is to do mail from the AOL 
Web site at www.aol.com, which has the advantage that you can 
use any Web browser from any computer. See the next section.
	
✓	Webmail: The whole point of webmail is that you can read it on (drum­
roll, please) the Web. Any Web browser will do, as described in the next 
section.
If you want to read your e-mail on your smartphone, see the section “Reading 
Your E-mail on Your Smartphone,” later in this chapter.

213
 Chapter 13: It’s in the Mail: Sending and Receiving E-Mail
The Web Is a Fine Place 
to Read Your E-Mail
No matter which type of e-mail account, you have, even if you normally 
use an e-mail program like Thunderbird or Outlook to read your messages, 
check whether your ISP or other mailbox provider has a Web-based mail 
system. On a webmail system, you can read your mail from any computer on 
the Internet, including computers at your friends’ houses, public libraries, 
and Internet cafés. For example, if you have a cable Internet account with 
Comcast, you can use its Web site to read and send messages at any com­
puter on the Net; go to comcast.net and click the Email link.
To find out whether your ISP provides webmail, go to its Web site and look 
around or write to its support e-mail address. Most ISPs have a Mail or simi­
lar link on their home pages. You log in with the same mailbox name and 
password that you may have jotted down in Table 13-1.
	
A cool thing about webmail systems such as Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, AIM Mail, and 
Hotmail is that you can read and send messages from any computer on the 
Net. Your mailbox is stored on the webmail server, and any computer with a 
Web browser can access it — you can check your mail from a friend’s com­
puter, at a cybercafé, or from the computer at the public library. Of course, no 
one can read your messages, or send messages as you, without typing your 
password. One downside is that reading and sending messages tends to be 
slower with webmail than with an e-mail program because you have to wait for 
a new Web page to open every time you click a new message.
Setting up a webmail account
If you don’t have a webmail account and you want one, follow these steps:
	
1.	Using your Web browser, go to the webmail service’s Web site.
	
	 Try Google Gmail at www.gmail.com, Windows Live Hotmail at mail.
live.com, Yahoo! Mail at mail.yahoo.com, or AIM Mail at webmail.
aol.com. See Chapter 6 for help starting your Web browser.
	
2.	Look for a link named Click Here to Get a Free E-Mail Account or 
Create Account or similar wording and follow the instructions to 
create your account.
	
	 They don’t ask anything too nosy. Be sure to click the links to read the 
terms of service (rules of the game) and privacy policy (what they plan to 
do with the information you give them).

214
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
	
3.	In Table 13-1, write down your e-mail address and your password.
	
	 Your e-mail address ends in @gmail.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com,
@yahoo.com, or @aim.com, depending on which service you chose.
You’ll end up with a username and password that you can use for other ser­
vices provided by these Web sites. You’re ready!
Reading webmail
You can read webmail — where else? — on the Web, whether your mailbox is 
at one of the webmail sites listed in the previous section or is hosted by your 
ISP. Almost every ISP has a Web site where you can read your mail.
To access your webmail mailbox, go to the Web site and log in:
	
1.	Go to the same Web site where you created your account.
	
	 If you created a webmail mailbox at AIM Mail (webmail.aol.com), 
Google Gmail (www.gmail.com), Windows Live Hotmail (mail.live.
com), or Yahoo! Mail (mail.yahoo.com), log in at that Web site. If your 
mailbox is provided by your ISP, employer, or school or another organi­
zation, go to its Web site.
	
2.	Sign in with your new username and password.
	
	 You see a Web page that may have ads and news and all kinds of other 
information, but somewhere is an Inbox link or other link for reading and 
sending mail. For example, Figure 13-1 shows the part of the Comcast 
home page where you can log in to myComcast to read your mail.
	
Figure 13-1: 
Log in, read 
e-mail.
	
	
3.	Click the Inbox or other mail-related link.
	
	 You see your inbox, which might look something like Figure 13-2. You 
may not have any e-mail yet, or you may have a welcome message from 
the webmail service. If so, you see the sender and subject line of the 
message.
	
4.	Click the message to read it.
	
	 Then you can click the Reply, Forward, or Delete buttons or links to deal 
with the message.

Sending e-mail with webmail
To send an e-mail message using webmail, follow these steps:
	
1.	Sign in.
	
	 See Steps 1 and 2 in the previous section to find out where to sign in.
	
2.	Click the Compose button or New button or any link that seems to be 
about writing and sending a message.
	
	 Your browser displays a form with boxes for To (the address) and 
Subject and a large, unlabeled box for the text of the message, as shown 
in Figure 13-3.
	
3.	Type one or more addresses in the To box.
	
	 If you want to send your message to more than one address, separate 
each address with a comma.
	
4.	If you see a Cc box, you can enter addresses there, too.
	
	 The Cc (carbon copy, for you historians) is for people to whom the mes­
sage isn’t directly addressed but who might want to be aware of your 
message.
	
5.	Type a subject line in the Subject box.
	
6.	Type your message in the big box.
	
7.	Click the Send button.
	
	 If you want to check your spelling first, which is the polite thing to do, 
look for a Spelling or Spell Check button to click before clicking Send.

Be sure to log out from the webmail site when you’re done reading and send­
ing mail, especially if you’re using a friend’s computer or a computer in a 
public place. Otherwise, someone else can come along and read or send mes­
sages using your account.
Reading Your E-Mail 
on Your Smartphone
Regular old cellphones can’t send or receive e-mail, but so-called smart­
phones can. (To find out what a smartphone is, see the section in Chapter 4 
about getting a little Blackberry, iPhone, or Palm.) Here are some tips for 
reading and sending mail depending on which kind of smartphone you 
have:
	
✓	BlackBerry: You get an e-mail address at Blackberry.com when you set 
up your phone. Ask your phone store to help.
	
✓	iPhone: An iPhone can read and send mail from one or several accounts. 
Tap Settings➪Mail Contacts Calendars➪Add Account. You see a list of 
popular mail providers, including Microsoft Exchange (used by many 
corporations and other organizations), MobileMe (see the following 

217
 Chapter 13: It’s in the Mail: Sending and Receiving E-Mail
sidebar, “Mobile who?”), Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and AOL. If your mail is 
somewhere else, tap Other➪Add Mail Account and enter your name, 
your e-mail address, your e-mail password, and a name for the account. 
Tap Save. Tap IMAP or POP, fill in the names of your incoming (IMAP or 
POP) and outgoing (SMTP) mail server, and tap Save.
	
✓	Palm: If your phone uses the Palm webOS, the process is something like 
this (but your phone store can probably help you if it doesn’t work): 
Open Email and tap Sign In. Tap Add an Account and enter your e-mail 
address and password, and tap Sign In again. Now you can open Email 
anytime you want to read or send messages. You can set up more than 
one e-mail account so that you can check your business and personal 
accounts.
	
✓	Windows Mobile phones: If your phone runs Windows Mobile (a teeny-
tiny, slow version of Windows), you can read and send e-mail from one 
or more accounts. Press the Start button and choose Messaging to 
start the e-mail program. To set up a new account, press Menu, choose 
Tools➪New Account, enter your e-mail address, and follow the instruc­
tions on the screen.
	
If you see an option similar to Leave Messages on Server, we recommend that 
you select it. If you have a choice between POP and IMAP as the account type, 
choose IMAP. (These two types of mail servers are described in the next sec­
tion of this chapter.) Although checking e-mail on a phone is cool, you also 
want to be able to check it on your computer!
If you don’t have a smartphone, you aren’t necessarily out of luck. Other ser­
vice providers (such as US Cellular) offer proprietary Web browsers that can 
retrieve webmail. Check with your cellphone provider.
Mobile who?
Apple offers the MobileMe server (at www.
me.com), where you can set up an @me.com 
e-mail address, an online calendar, and an 
online contacts list (address book). You can 
see them on any PC or Mac and on your iPhone. 
The service looks slick, but it costs $99. You 
can do the same thing for free by using a Gmail 
account (which includes a contacts list) and 
Google Calendar — all three are usable from 
any Web browser and iPhone. MobileMe also 
includes an online file storage area, a photo 
gallery, and (our favorite part) a Find My Phone 
feature, which can show your phone’s location 
on a map. However, it doesn’t seem to be able 
to tell you which couch cushion it’s under.

218
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Reading Your E-Mail in a Mail Program
Although reading your mail on the Web is convenient, it’s usually slower than 
using a real mail program. Mail programs have more features than many web­
mail sites, too. Many mail programs are available. Many businesses and other 
organizations use Outlook, which comes with Microsoft Office. Our favorite 
free mail program is Thunderbird, from the same people who make Firefox, 
an excellent free Web browser.
If you want to use a mail program (we sure do!), you need to figure out which 
mail servers it uses for sending and receiving mail, choose a program (down­
load it if you don’t already have it), and set it up. This section walks you 
through the process.
Mail servers galore
If you use a mail program to read your e-mail, one of the things you have to 
set in your mail program is the incoming mail server, which holds your mail 
until your mail program picks it up. (AOL and webmail users can skim this 
section.)
IMAP: Mail anywhere and everywhere
When you use POP to pick up your mail, the 
messages are downloaded to your PC and 
stored there and are deleted from your mailbox 
on the mail server. If, like most people, you build 
up large files of saved messages, the saved 
messages are on your PC and accessible only 
from your mail program on that PC. Often that’s 
good enough, but if you read your mail in more 
than one place (say, at home and at work), it 
can be a pain if you’re one place and the saved 
message with a crucial work-related item (a 
recipe for Killer Tequila Nachos, for example) 
is in the other. IMAP solves this problem by 
storing all your mail on a mail server so that 
you can access it from any mail program, and 
you have the same set of mailboxes no matter 
which computer you use. Many mail systems 
offer both IMAP and webmail, in which case 
you see the same mail in your mail program as 
you see in the webmail.
To use IMAP, you need a broadband connec­
tion at each of the places you read your mail, 
because IMAP is rather sluggish on dialup and 
your mail provider has to offer IMAP service. 
Because all your mail folders are on your ISP’s 
computer, see how much mail you’re allowed to 
store there because folders can get pretty big. 
One or 2 megabytes is tight, whereas 100 mega­
bytes should be plenty unless you mail around a 
lot of video files.

219
 Chapter 13: It’s in the Mail: Sending and Receiving E-Mail
The usual way to pick up mail is known as POP (Post Office Protocol, some­
times also written as POP3 because it’s version 3). All ISPs offer POP as the 
standard way to receive your mail. (If you have broadband, you’ll like the IMAP 
alternative, described in the following sidebar.) To send mail, your mail pro­
gram reverses the process and sends messages to your outgoing mail server (or 
SMTP server, for the badly misnamed Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
Write the names of your incoming (POP or IMAP) and outgoing (SMTP) mail 
servers in Table 13-1. If you don’t know what to write, ask your ISP or which­
ever organization hosts your e-mail mailbox. With luck, your mail program 
has the server names set automatically, but when the setup gets screwed up, 
you’ll be glad that you know how to restore its settings.
	
If you want to use a mail program (like Thunderbird or Outlook) to read AOL 
or webmail, here are the mail servers they provide:
	
✓	AOL has its own mail system, so AOL users don’t use POP, IMAP, or 
SMTP servers when they’re using AOL’s own software. However, AOL 
provides a POP server (pop.aol.com), an IMAP server (imap.aol.
com), and an SMTP server (smtp.aol.com) in case you want to use 
another mail program. Use your AOL username and password to connect.
	
✓	AIM Mail (at mail.aol.com) is free webmail that you can sign up for 
even if you don’t have an AOL account. It has the same POP, IMAP, and 
SMTP servers as AOL’s mail.
	
✓	Windows Live Hotmail (at hotmail.com or mail.live.com) doesn’t 
do POP, IMAP, or SMTP. Microsoft Windows Live Mail program can 
connect directly to a Hotmail account, or if you use Outlook, the mail 
program that comes with Microsoft Office, you can download the 
Microsoft Office Outlook Connector to read your Hotmail mail from 
Outlook. (From microsoft.com/downloads, search for Microsoft 
Office Outlook Connector.)
	
✓	Yahoo! Mail (at mail.yahoo.com) provides Web-based accounts, but 
if you sign up for its premium Yahoo! Plus service at $20 per year, it also 
provides a POP server (pop.mail.yahoo.com) in case you want to use 
a mail program rather than your browser to read your mail. It may also 
add IMAP support for use from smartphones. The free program YPOPS 
(at ypopsemail.com) works to give you POP and SMTP for a free 
Yahoo! Mail account.
	
✓	Gmail (at gmail.com) provides POP (pop.gmail.com), IMAP (imap.
gmail.com), and SMTP (smtp.gmail.com) servers for all its users. 
You enable them by clicking Settings at the top of any Gmail page, click­
ing Forwarding and POP/IMAP, and clicking either Enable POP or Enable 
IMAP. If you use IMAP, enter your entire e-mail address (including the @
gmail.com) as your username and change the port from 143 to 993. Then 
choose SSL as the connection type. For your outgoing mail, you need to 
change the port for the SMTP server from 25 to 587 and choose TLS as 
the connection type.

Which mail program do you like?
You can easily make a specific e-mail program do what you want — after all, 
dealing with mail is what these programs are for. We picked the two most 
popular e-mail programs to show you the ropes:
Windows Live Essentials
Windows 7 doesn’t come with all the free pro­
grams that earlier versions of Windows did. The 
reason might be the Microsoft response to vari­
ous antitrust suits, in which the makers of com­
peting programs (other Web browsers, e-mail 
programs, and chat programs, for example) 
pointed out that Microsoft took advantage of 
sales of Windows itself to push its other prod­
ucts. Or, maybe Microsoft had other reasons.
Instead, Windows 7 encourages you to down
load the Windows Live Essentials pack­
age, which includes several Internet-related 
programs:
	✓	Windows Live Mail, described in this 
chapter
	✓	Windows Live Toolbar, an add-on to the 
Internet Explorer Web browser, described 
in Chapter 7. It includes a Mail button that 
displays your Hotmail inbox page in your 
browser.
	✓	Windows Live Messenger, an instant mes­
saging program described in Chapter 16
	✓	Windows Live Photo Gallery, a photo-
editing and -organizing program described 
in Chapter 18
	✓	Windows Live Writer, a blogging program 
described in Chapter 19
	✓	Windows Live Family Safety, an Internet 
filtering program described in Chapter 3
You don’t have to have Windows 7 to use 
these programs; they work with Windows XP 
(with Service Pack 2) and Windows Vista, too. 
To download Windows Live Essentials, follow 
these steps:
	 1.	 Go to download.live.com and click 
Download. (In Windows 7, you can also 
choose Start➪Getting Started➪Go Online 
to Get Windows Live Essentials.)
	 2.	 Save the file in your Downloads folder.
	 3.	 Open or run the file you just downloaded.
	 4.	 Choose which Windows Live Essential 
programs you want to download. You can 
download others later.
	 5.	 During the installation, the program asks to 
set Live Search as your default search pro­
vider; Chapter 8 describes ways to search 
the Web. We recommend deselecting this 
option because you might prefer another 
search site.
	 6.	 The installation program asks to make MSN 
your browser’s home page, which we doubt 
you will enjoy, so deselect that one, too.
	 7.	 Finally, the installation program suggests 
that you sign up for a Windows Live ID. This 
free account gives you a Hotmail webmail 
mailbox and lets you participate in instant 
messaging. You can click Sign Up now, or 
you can sign up at any time at signup.
live.com.
See Chapter 12 for more information about 
downloading and installing software from the 
Internet.

 Chapter 13: It’s in the Mail: Sending and Receiving E-Mail
	
✓	Thunderbird: The people at the Mozilla Foundation who created Firefox, 
the Web browser we describe in Chapter 7, have also written the excel­
lent, free e-mail program Thunderbird. It works with regular Internet 
accounts as well as with AOL accounts and some webmail accounts. Refer 
to Chapter 12 to find out how to download and install Thunderbird.
	
✓	Windows Live Mail: Windows Live Mail is part of Windows Live 
Essentials (see the sidebar of that name, earlier in this chapter).
	
✓	Windows Mail: Windows Vista comes with Windows Mail. Windows XP 
(and earlier versions) came with the mail program Outlook Express, 
which looks similar to Windows Mail. Note: Despite the similar name, 
Outlook Express is unrelated to Outlook, the mail program included with 
the Microsoft Office package.
Before you can use your mail program, you need to tell it two things:
	
✓	Where your mailbox is stored: Usually on a POP or IMAP server at 
your ISP
	
✓	Where to send outgoing mail: Usually to the same or another mail 
server at your ISP
Follow the instructions in the following sections to get your mail program up 
and running. Later sections describe how to send and receive mail with each 
program.
Setting up Thunderbird
The Mozilla Foundation, which creates free, open source software, has writ­
ten Thunderbird to complement its excellent Firefox browser. This chapter 
describes Thunderbird 2. To download it and set it up, follow these steps:
	
1.	Download and install Thunderbird from www.mozilla.com.
	
	 Chapter 12 describes how to download and install programs; follow its 
procedures.
	
2.	Start Thunderbird by clicking the desktop icon or choosing Start➪All 
Programs➪Mozilla Thunderbird➪Mozilla Thunderbird.
	
	 The first time you run Thunderbird, the Account Wizard runs, asking 
for your name, the type of e-mail account you have (POP or IMAP), 
your e-mail address, and your mail servers (incoming and outgoing), as 
described in the earlier section “Mail servers galore.”
	
3.	Type your name, e-mail address, incoming mail server, and outgoing 
server, copying the information from Table 13-1.
	
	 When you’re done, you see your new account in the Account Settings 
window, which you can close.

222
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
If you need to change your e-mail account information later or set up 
Thunderbird to work with a different e-mail account, choose Tools➪Account 
Settings. To run the Account Wizard again, click New Account. To change the 
settings for an existing account, choose the account, click the settings cat­
egories below the account name, and change the settings that appear.
The Thunderbird window looks like the one shown in Figure 13-4. A list of 
your mailboxes (mail folders) appears in the upper left corner. To the right is 
a list of the messages in that mailbox and the text of the selected message.
	
Figure 13-4: 
Thunderbird 
displays 
mail folders 
to the left, 
messages to 
the (upper) 
right, and

message to 
the lower

Setting up Windows Live Mail
You can download Windows Live Mail along with any other Windows Live 
Essentials programs you might want to use. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Follow the steps in the “Windows Live Essentials” sidebar, earlier in 
this chapter, to download Windows Live Mail.
	
	 You can download other Windows Live programs, too, if you want them.
	
2.	Choose Start➪Windows Live Mail.
	
	 You see the Add an E-Mail Account window, shown in Figure 13-5.
	
3.	Enter your e-mail address, password, and name and click Next.
	
	 Or, if you want to sign up for a free Hotmail account, click the link.
	
4.	Enter the specs for your incoming mail server and outgoing server, 
copying the information from Table 13-1.

223
 Chapter 13: It’s in the Mail: Sending and Receiving E-Mail
	
	 If you have an account at any of the popular webmail systems (including 
Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, AOL, and Gmail), you can skip this step because 
the system already knows how to set it up. Windows Live Mail down­
loads the folders and mail from the mail server.
	
5.	If the program displays a list of your folders (usually just Inbox, Trash, 
and a few other folders, unless you’ve created more), click OK.

The Windows Live Mail layout looks a little different from the other mail pro­
grams, with a lefthand column of tasks and features, a middle column that 
lists your messages, and a righthand column that shows the selected mes­
sage, as shown in Figure 13-6.

Setting up Windows Mail
Windows Vista comes with Windows Mail already installed. (If you still use 
Windows XP and Outlook Express, it’s similar.)
To run Windows Mail, choose Start@-->Windows Mail. The first time you run 
Windows Mail, the Internet Connection Wizard wakes up and asks some ques­
tions: Most of the answers you should already have written in Table 13-1. 
When prompted, type your name, e-mail address, incoming (POP or IMAP) 
mail server, outgoing (SMTP) mail server, username, and password. Click 
Next after filling in the information that the wizard requests, and then click 
Finish when the wizard says that you can leave.
When you finish, you see the Windows Mail window. The layout is similar to 
Thunderbird’s, displaying the Folders and Contacts lists, a message list, and 
the selected message.
If you need to add or change your e-mail accounts later, choose Tools➪
Accounts from the menu. Click the Mail tab if it’s not already selected. You 
can edit an account by clicking it and clicking the Properties button. Add an 
e-mail account (mailbox) by clicking the Add button.
Sending Mail Is Easy
Whether you use an e-mail program or webmail, sending messages is easy 
enough that we show you a few examples rather than waste time explaining 
the theory. It works much the same way in all e-mail programs.
Follow these steps to write an e-mail message and send it off:
	
1.	Click the Write icon (in Thunderbird), the New button (in Windows 
Live Mail), or the Create Mail icon (in Windows Mail), or press Ctrl+N.
	
	 A window (the Compose or New Message window) opens. In webmail, 
your composition area appears in the Web browser.
	
2.	Fill in the recipient’s address (or recipients’ addresses) in the To box.
	
	 You can send this message to more than one person at a time by entering 
more than one To address. This feature works a little differently in dif­
ferent programs. In Thunderbird, press Enter (rather than Tab) to move 
down a line to enter another address. In Windows Live Mail, just type a 
comma or semicolon between the addresses. In Windows Mail, press Tab.
	
	 Remembering people’s e-mail addresses is annoying (or, for those of 
us at a Certain Age, just plain impossible). See the section in Chapter 
15 about keeping track of your friends to find out how to add people to 
your address book and use it when sending messages.

225
 Chapter 13: It’s in the Mail: Sending and Receiving E-Mail
	
3.	Add any Cc or Bcc addresses that you want the messages to go to.
	
	 See the later sidebar “CC and BCC” if you’re wondering what we’re 
talking about. In Thunderbird, after you enter an address, click the To 
button next to the address and select Cc or Bcc from the list that drops 
down. In Windows Live Mail, click Show Cc & Bcc to see boxes in which 
you can enter those addresses in the New Message window. In Windows 
Mail, choose View➪All Headers.
	
4.	Type the subject in the Subject box.
	
	Make it specific. If you want help, don’t type Help! as the subject. Type 
Need help getting my cat not to spit out his pills.
	
	 Press Tab to move to the message box.
	
5.	Type the message in the big box.
	
	The cursor should be blinking in the message area, the large, empty box 
where you type the message.
	
6.	Click the Send icon or button to send the message.
	
	 In Thunderbird, you can also press Ctrl+Enter or choose File➪Send Now. 
In Windows Live Mail and Windows Mail, you can press Alt+S.
	
7.	If the message isn’t sent right away, tell your mail program to send all 
waiting messages by clicking the Get Mail icon (in Thunderbird) or the 
Send/Receive icon (in Windows Mail). In Windows Live Mail, press F5.
	
When you send a message in which you use formatting (such as boldface or 
italics, by using the toolbar buttons in the Compose window), Thunderbird 
may ask whether you really want to send the message using formatting. See 
the sidebar “To format or not to format,” later in this chapter, to find out when 
to send formatted messages.
Cc and Bcc
The term carbon copy should be familiar to 
those of you who were born before 1965 and 
remember the ancient practice of putting 
sheets of carbon-coated paper between sheets 
of regular paper to make extra copies when 
using a typewriter. (Please don’t ask us what a 
typewriter is.) In e-mail, a carbon copy is simply 
a copy of the message you send. All recipients, 
on both the To and Cc lines, see who’s receiving 
the message — unless a recipient’s e-mail 
address is typed in the Bcc field instead. Blind 
carbon copies (Bccs) are copies sent to people 
without putting their names on the message so 
that the other recipients are none the wiser. 
You can figure out why you may want to send 
a copy to someone but not want everyone to 
know that you sent it.

226
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Spell-checking your message is a good idea; avoid the embarrassment of 
spotting your typos only after it’s too late to fix them. You can ask your mail 
program to check the spelling in your message before you send it. Click the 
Spell icon to see which typos your program finds. In Thunderbird, you can 
also press Ctrl+K or choose Options➪Check Spelling; in Windows Mail, press 
F7 or choose Tools➪Spelling.
	
After your mail program sends a piece of e-mail to the outgoing mail server, 
you can’t cancel it!
Mail Coming Your Way
If you send e-mail, and in most cases even if you don’t, you most likely 
receive it also. The arrival of e-mail is always exciting, even when you receive 
200 messages a day. (It’s exciting in a depressing kind of way, sometimes.)
A helpful feature of mail programs (not webmail) is that you can compose 
mail while you’re offline. On the other hand, when you want to check your 
To format or not to format
Years ago, someone got tired of e-mail’s plain, 
unformatted appearance. Once almost all com­
puters could display boldface, italics, different 
fonts, and different font sizes, why not use them 
in e-mail? And formatted e-mail was born.
Very old e-mail programs may not be able to 
display formatted e-mail. All the programs 
described in this chapter, including webmail, 
can. The formatting usually takes one of two 
forms: MIME, in which the formatted text is 
sent like an attached file with the message, and 
HTML, in which Web page formatting codes 
are included in the text. If your mail program 
can’t display formatted mail and you receive a 
formatted message, you see all kinds of gobble­
dygook mixed in with the text of the message, 
rendering it unreadable.
A big problem is that any HTML-formatted mail 
can potentially contain viruses, hostile Web 
pages that take over the screen, and other 
annoying or dangerous content. Some people 
turn off HTML mail, both the nice mail that you 
send and the nasty kind, to avoid having to deal 
with the nasty kind.
Boldface, italics, and color can add emphasis 
and interest to your messages although they’re 
no substitute for clear, concise writing. Some 
people (including John) prefer mail without 
formatting. To be sure that a message doesn’t 
have any of that tatty-looking formatting, do this 
in the New Message or Compose window when 
you’re writing your message:
	✓	Thunderbird: Choose Options➪Format➪
Plain Text Only
	✓	Windows Live Mail: Press Alt to dis­
play the hidden menus, and then choose 
Format➪Plain Text.
	✓	Windows Mail: Choose Format➪Plain Text.

 Chapter 13: It’s in the Mail: Sending and Receiving E-Mail
mailbox for your most current messages, you have to connect to the Internet. 
Webmail users have to be online to do anything.
Reading your messages
To check your e-mail in almost any e-mail program, follow these steps:
	
1.	Start your e-mail program if it’s not already running.
	
	 If you use webmail, start your Web browser and go to your webmail 
Web site.
	
2.	If your program doesn’t retrieve mail automatically, select the Check 
Mail, Sync, or Send/Receive button on the toolbar to retrieve your mail.
	
	 If you have a full-time Internet connection, your mail program may 
retrieve your mail automatically, in which case you only have to start 
the program to fetch your mail. In addition, if you leave your mail pro­
gram running, even hidden at the bottom of your screen as an icon, it 
may automatically check for new mail every once in a while. Most mail 
programs can even pick up mail while you’re reading or sending other 
messages.
	
	 The program may play a tune or display a message when you receive 
messages. The mail appears in your inbox (usually in a window or folder 
named In or Inbox), showing one line per message. If you don’t see it, 
double-click the In or Inbox mailbox in the list of mailboxes that usually 
appears on the left side of the window.
	
3.	To see a message, double-click the line or click the line and press 
Enter.
	
	 You see the text of the message, along with buttons for replying, for­
warding, and deleting the message.
	
4.	To stop looking at a message, click the Close (X) button in the upper 
right corner of the message window (the standard way to get rid of a 
window) or press Ctrl+W or Ctrl+F4.
	
	 On a Mac, click the red Close button in the upper left corner.
	
Here are some tips for displaying your inbox in specific e-mail programs:
	
✓	Thunderbird: To display your inbox, click your e-mail address, account 
name, or Inbox in the Mail Folders list.
	
✓	Windows Live Mail: If you’ve clicked Calendar (to see an appointment 
calendar), Feeds (to see articles from newsfeeds or blogs to which you 
have subscribed), or Newsgroups (to participate in online discussion 
groups, described on the Web at net.gurus.org/usenet or groups.
google.com), you may need to click Mail to return to the Mail part of 
the program.

228
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
	
	To tell Windows Live Mail to check for new messages, click the Sync 
button on the toolbar, just to the right of the Delete button. If you don’t 
see it, your Windows Live Mail window is too narrow (ours usually is); 
make your window wider.
	
✓	Windows Mail: If you don’t see your inbox, double-click the Local 
Folders item in the Folders list.
You can do lots of other tasks with messages (such as reply, save, and for­
ward), which we discuss in Chapter 15.
Deleting messages the 
quick-and-easy way
You don’t have to read every single message before you delete it; sometimes, 
you can guess from the sender’s name or the Subject line that reading the 
message would be a waste of time. If you subscribe to mailing lists (which we 
describe in Chapter 16), certain topics may not interest you.
Buttons on the e-mail program’s toolbar at the top of its window let you dis­
pose of your mail. First, click once to highlight the message. Then (in most 
mail programs) click the Trash or Delete button on the toolbar to discard the 
message.
In webmail, on the Web page that displays each message is some kind of 
Delete button. Some webmail systems have a check box on the Web page that 
lists all messages in your inbox folder, and a Delete button at the bottom of 
the list. To delete a bunch of messages, select their check boxes and then 
click Delete.
One-click surfing
Most e-mail programs display Web addresses 
as links. That is, if the text of a message 
includes a Web address (such as http://
net.gurus.org), the address appears 
underlined and perhaps in blue. Just click the 
link to display the page in your browser.
When you send messages, you don’t have to do 
anything special to display a Web address as a 
link — the recipient’s mail program should do it 
automatically.

229
 Chapter 13: It’s in the Mail: Sending and Receiving E-Mail
When you delete a message, most e-mail programs don’t throw it away imme­
diately. Instead, they file the message in your Trash or Deleted Messages 
mailbox or mail folder, or just mark it as deleted. From time to time (usually 
whenever you close the e-mail program), the program empties your trash, 
truly deleting the messages. Until then, you can undelete it if you deleted it 
by mistake.
To Whom Do I Write?
As you probably have figured out, one teensy detail is keeping you from send­
ing e-mail to all your friends: You don’t know their addresses. In this section, 
you find out lots of different ways to look for addresses. Start out with the 
easiest, most reliable way to find out people’s e-mail addresses:
Call them on the phone and ask them.
Pretty low-tech, huh? For some reason, this technique seems to be absolutely 
the last thing people want to do. (See the nearby sidebar “Top ten reasons 
not to call someone to find an e-mail address.”) Try it first. If you know or 
can find out the phone number, this method is much easier than any of the 
others.
Another way to find a person’s e-mail address is by using an online directory. 
Wouldn’t it be cool if an online directory listed everybody’s e-mail addresses? 
Maybe, but the Internet doesn’t have one. For one thing, nothing says that 
somebody’s e-mail address has any connection to her name. For another, not 
everybody wants everybody else to know his e-mail address.
Another approach is to go to a search engine, such as Google (www.google.
com) or Yahoo! Search (www.yahoo.com), and type the person’s full name, 
enclosed in quotes. You see a list of pages that include the name — of course, 
many people may have the same name if your friend is named Allen Johnson 
or Bob Smith. Or, try Yahoo! People Search at people.yahoo.com, which 
enables you to search by name and state. Try searching for your own name 
and see what you find!
If you’re in contact with someone by way of Facebook or another social net­
working site (described in Chapter 18), you can send them messages through 
that site to ask for an e-mail address.

	 9.	 You want to surprise a long-lost ex-friend 
who owes you a large amount of money 
and thinks that she has given you the slip.
	 8.	 Your friend doesn’t speak English. (That

	 7.	 You don’t — or your friend doesn’t — even

Keeping Your Mail Safe from 
Viruses, Spam, and Wi-Fi Snoops
In This Chapter
▶	Protecting yourself from viruses by e-mail
▶	Dealing with spam (it’s not just for breakfast any more)
▶	Considering who might read your messages
▶	Securing your mail against wireless snooping
O
kay, maybe you know how to send and receive e-mail. If you do, it’s 
time to have a little chat about e-mail safety. If you’ve used e-mail, 
you probably have already seen spam and maybe even viruses. Take a look 
at Chapter 2 for definitions of these e-mail-borne menaces. This chapter 
describes how to protect yourself from them. Listen up.
I Think I’ve Got a Virus
A virus arrives on your computer as an attachment to an e-mail message. 
(Refer to the section in Chapter 2 about viruses arriving by e-mail for a 
description of how viruses work.) In most mail programs, programs con­
tained in attachments don’t run until you click them — so don’t open pro­
grams that come from people you don’t know. Don’t even open attachments 
from people you do know if you weren’t expecting to receive them. Many 
successful viruses replicate themselves by sending copies of themselves to 
the first 50 people in an address book. Many viruses look like they come from 
someone who knows you.
It used to be that only an attachment that looked like a program (for example, 
a file with the filename extension .com or .exe) could contain a virus. Then 
the bad guys (aided by software written without security in mind) came up 

232
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
with ways to hide viruses in word processing documents, PDF files (print-
ready formatted documents, described in the section in Chapter 12 about 
files and what to do with them), and even pictures.
In addition to taking care not to run viruses by opening attachments, you 
should set up your virus checker and mail program to catch as many 
viruses as possible and not to run them inadvertently. The following sec­
tions explain how.
Configuring your virus checker
In Chapter 4, we tell you to install a virus checker as soon as you connect 
your computer to the Internet, but this topic is so important that we tell you 
again. You need to pay for a virus checker — and you need to pay annually 
to keep your subscription current for updates to the list of viruses that the 
checker checks for. (The free ClamWin at www.clamwin.com looks promis­
ing but isn’t ready for prime time yet.) The many good virus checkers include
	
✓	AVG, at free.avg.com
	
✓	F-Prot, at www.f-prot.com
	
✓	McAfee VirusScan, at www.mcafee.com
	
✓	Norton AntiVirus, at www.symantec.com
	
✓	Windows Defender, at www.microsoft.com/windows/products/
winfamily/defender (If you use Windows 7 or Vista, you already 
have it.)
After your virus checker is installed, look at its configuration settings to make 
sure that the program downloads updates regularly. You can set up the pro­
gram to connect to the Internet and download updates automatically. Most 
programs check for updates at least weekly. If you have an always-on Internet 
connection and you leave your computer on all the time, you can configure 
your program to check in the middle of the night so that it never disturbs 
you during the day. If you turn off your computer when you’re not using it or 
if you have a dial-up Internet account, you need to remember to run the pro­
gram’s update function regularly.
Most virus checkers look for viruses in two ways:
	
✓	Check e-mail messages as they arrive.
	
✓	Scan your whole computer (your hard disk) for viruses.
We recommend that you turn on both these options.

233
 Chapter 14: Keeping Your Mail Safe from Viruses, Spam, and Wi-Fi Snoops
You can also configure what your virus checker does when it finds a virus in 
a file. You usually have options like these:
	
✓	Disinfection: Throws away the virus but keeps the rest of the file
	
✓	Quarantine: Moves the file to a safe place on your computer
	
✓	Deletion: Just kills the file
We recommend that you set your virus checker to delete virus files. Infected 
files are unlikely to contain anything you want, and we can’t see any reason 
to leave them lying around your hard disk.
Configuring your mail program 
against viruses
Depending on which mail program you use, you may need to tell it about 
your virus-checker.
Webmail (at least, the big, popular ones, such as Yahoo Mail!, Hotmail, Gmail, 
and AIM Mail) includes virus-checkers, although you should still install and 
run one on your own computer.
Thunderbird was designed to resist viruses: It doesn’t use Internet Explorer 
to display formatted e-mail messages (as some other mail programs do), and 
it doesn’t automatically open attachments. If you’re running a third-party 
virus filter, such as the ones listed in the previous section, choose Tools➪
Options in the main window, click the Privacy button at the top of the 
options window and then the Anti-Virus tab, and be sure that the Allow Anti-
Virus Clients to Quarantine Individual Messages check box is selected.
Checking security settings 
in Windows (Live) Mail
	
Windows Mail (which comes with Windows Vista) may use Internet Explorer 
to display messages, which can run viruses: We recommend that you check 
the Microsoft site www.windowsupdate.com weekly for the latest bug fixes 
or follow the directions there to set Windows Update to do it automatically.
Windows Live Mail (downloadable as part of Windows Live Essentials, 
described in Chapter 13) includes a virus-checker and spam filter, too.

If you use either of these programs, check its security configuration. 
Here’s how:
	
1.	In Windows Mail, choose Tools➪Options. In Windows Live Mail, click 
the Menus icon on the toolbar and choose Safety Options.
	
	 You see the (Safety) Options dialog box, shown in Figure 14-1.
	
Figure 14-1: 
Windows 
Mail and

protection 
settings.
	
	
2.	Click the Security tab.
	
	 The Virus Protection and Download Images sections both deserve your 
attention.
	
3.	Set the Internet Explorer security zone to Restricted Sites Zone.
	
	 If you work in a corporation and expect to receive programs in e-mail 
from co-workers, you may need to change this setting; talk to your 
system administrator. For the rest of us, this setting is the safest.
	
4.	Make sure that the Warn Me When Other Applications Try to Send Mail 
As Me check box is selected. (Click it if it doesn’t contain a check mark.)
	
	 If your computer is infected with a spyware or virus program that tries to 
use your computer as a spam-sending machine, this setting may prevent it.
	
5.	Select the Do Not Allow Attachments to Be Saved or Opened That 
Could Potentially Be a Virus so that it contains a check mark.
	
	 If you expect to receive programs, Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, 
or Access databases, you need to turn off this setting because all these 
types of files can contain viruses. Start out with it turned on, though.

Chain letters: Arrrrrggghhh!
One of the most obnoxious things you can 
do with e-mail is pass around chain letters. 
Because all mail programs have forwarding 
commands, you can send a chain letter along 
to hundreds of other people with only a few 
keystrokes. Don’t do it. Chain letters are cute 
for about two seconds, and then they’re just 
annoying. After 20 years of using e-mail, we’ve 
never received a chain letter worth pass­
ing along. That’s NEVER! (Please excuse the 
shouting.) Don’t pass them along, okay? No, 
they don’t destroy your computer, but they’re 
just annoying.
A few chain letters just keep coming around 
and around, despite our best efforts to stamp 
them out:
	✓	Make big bucks with a chain letter: These 
letters usually contain lots of testimoni­
als from people who are now rolling in 
dough, and they tell you to send $5 to the 
name at the top of the list, put your name 
at the bottom, and send the message to 
a zillion other suckers. Some even say, 
“This isn’t a chain letter.” (You’re suppos­
edly helping to compile a mailing list or 
sending reports or something — your 100 
percent guaranteed tipoff that it’s a chain 
letter). Don’t even think about forwarding it. 
These chain letters are illegal in the United 
States even when they say that they aren’t, 
and, besides, they don’t even work. (Why 
send any money? Why not just add your 
name and send it on? Heck, why not just 
replace all names on the list with yours?) 
Think of them as gullibility viruses. Send a 
polite note to the sender’s postmaster to 
encourage her to tell users not to send any 
more chain letters. If you don’t believe that 
they’re illegal, see the Postal Service Web 
site at www.usps.com/postallaw/
_txt/RANDReport.txt.
	✓	Big company will send you cash for read­
ing e-mail: This one has circulated with 
either Disney or Microsoft as the desig­
nated corporation. The message claims 
that the company is conducting a market­
ing test and that you can win big bucks or 
a trip to Disney World for sending along the 
message. Some claim that a sick child will 
receive one cent for each person you for­
ward the message to. Yeah, right. A varia­
tion says that something interesting but 
unspecified will happen when you forward 
it; we suppose that’s true if having all your 
friends find out you’re a sucker is interest­
ing. This chain letter isn’t dangerous; it’s 
just a waste of time — yours and everyone 
to whom you send it.
	✓	Hideous virus will wreck your computer: 
Occasionally, these are true; generally 
they’re not, and when they are true, they 
tend to be about viruses that have been 
around since 1992. If you run software 
that’s subject to viruses, look at the ven­
dor’s Web site and at the sites belonging 
to antivirus software makers for some more 
credible reports, downloadable updates, 
and antivirus advice. Some of the appar­
ent virus warnings are themselves viruses. 
If a message shows up saying, “Install this 
patch from Microsoft immediately to keep 
viruses out,” it’s not a patch; it’s a virus.

Get This Spam Outta Here!
Spam is unsolicited bulk e-mail, and we describe its history and sources in 
detail in Chapter 2. But you probably don’t care about details — you just 
want it to go away.
One approach to spam is to ask your computer to figure out which messages 
are spam and then either trash them or put them in a separate folder so 
that you can trash them yourself. This seems like the perfect solution. The 
problem is how to get your computer to know what is spam and what is not. 
Many techniques are available, but none is perfect. Here are a few of the most 
common types:
	
✓	Blackhole list: A number of organizations circulate lists of Internet 
addresses that they consider to be sources of spam. Most ISPs sub­
scribe to one or more of these blackhole lists and block all messages 
from listed sites. These ISPs block spam for you, at least the spam that 
comes from these Internet addresses. That’s not all the spam, but it can 
catch about 3⁄4 of it, which is a good start.
	
✓	Content-based filter: These filters look for words or phrases in the 
e-mail that are common in spam. They also note certain formatting 
errors that spammers seem to make often. Each text match earns a 
score. If a message scores above a certain threshold, it gets trashed. For 
example, messages with the word Viagra or the phrase mortgage rate are 
much more likely to be spam than other messages are.
	
✓	Bayesian filter: The mathematician Tom Bayes died 208 years before 
the Internet was born, but his groundbreaking work in statistics now 
helps computers figure out what is spam by being shown examples of 
messages that are spam along with others that are not. Many e-mail pro­
grams have built-in Bayesian filters. In your e-mail program, you might 
have noticed a button or menu option labeled something like This Is 
Junk. As you read your e-mail, you tell it which messages are spam. After 
a while, the program starts guessing based on the examples you give it 
and redirects suspected spam into a Junk or Trash mailbox so that you 
don’t have to read it. However, you do need to check the spam mailbox 
from time to time because the Bayesian filter may guess wrong and 
move in good messages with the bad.
All these methods make mistakes that let through some spam and block the 
occasional legit message. To reduce the latter problem, some e-mail systems 
whitelist senders who are listed in your e-mail address book, telling the filters 
that you always want to see messages from those senders — perhaps your 
boss or your significant other. Whitelists don’t help you receive messages 
from long-lost friends or people who just changed their e-mail addresses 
because their ISPs got bought out.

237
 Chapter 14: Keeping Your Mail Safe from Viruses, Spam, and Wi-Fi Snoops
Filtering spam in webmail
The major webmail sites try to identify spam and move it to a Junk or Spam 
folder. (In Gmail, you may need to click a “More” link to see the Spam folder.) 
Take a look in this folder from time to time to look for any real messages that 
might accidentally have gotten marked as spam. (In the technical jargon, it’s 
known as “mixing the ham with the spam.”)
When reading your incoming mail, if you see spam messages, you can mark 
them as spam, which helps the webmail service identify these messages in 
the future. From the list of messages, select the message and click the Spam, 
Report Spam, or Junk icon or link.
You can configure how aggressively your webmail service looks for spam. In 
Yahoo Mail!, click Options➪Mail Options and click Spam to see the Spam set­
tings shown in Figure 14-2. In AIM Mail, click Settings and then Spam Controls. 
In Hotmail, click Options➪More Options➪Filters and Reporting. (As of late 
2009, Gmail doesn’t have spam controls you can set.) You can control how 
stringently the system filters out spam and what it does with suspected spam.
	
Figure 14-2: 
Yahoo! Mail 
provides 
spam filter-
ing, as do 
most other 
webmail 
services.
	
Filtering spam in Thunderbird
Thunderbird 2 contains a Bayesian filer that works pretty well after you give 
it some examples of what your spam looks like.

238
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Telling Thunderbird to start filtering
First, set up your spam-filtering configuration settings, like this:
	
1.	Choose Tools➪Account Settings. In the new window, click Junk 
Settings under your e-mail account.
	
	 You see the Junk Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 14-3.
	
Figure 14-3: 
Configuring 
Thunderbird 
to can your 
spam.
	
	
2.	Select the Enable Adaptive Junk Mail Controls for This Account check 
box if it’s not already selected.
	
3.	Select the check box labeled Do Not Mark Mail As Junk If the Sender 
Is in Personal Address Book if it doesn’t already contain a check mark 
in it.
	
	 Usually, people you know don’t spam you.
	
4.	Click to select the Move New Junk Messages To check box if it doesn’t 
already contain a check mark. Choose where to move your spam.
	
	 The default setting is a Junk folder, which sounds good to us.
	
5.	Clear any check mark from the Automatically Delete Junk Messages 
Older Than ___ Days check box.
	
	 Until your filter is well trained, don’t let Thunderbird delete suspected 
spam before you have a chance to review it. It’s terribly embarrassing 
to tell someone that you threw away their important message because 
your program thought it was spam.

239
 Chapter 14: Keeping Your Mail Safe from Viruses, Spam, and Wi-Fi Snoops
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	 If you have set up more than one account, repeat this set of steps for 
each account in the Account Settings window.
Now Thunderbird is ready to distinguish the spam from the ham — the bad 
messages from the good. As you read the messages in your Inbox folder, 
every time you receive a spam message, click the Junk button on the toolbar. 
The message vanishes from your inbox, and Thunderbird analyzes the words 
in the message and makes a note that they’re likely to appear in spam. The 
more spam messages you mark with the Junk button, the more Thunderbird 
knows about what spam looks like.
Checking your Junk folder for real mail
From time to time (every week or so), open the Junk mail folder (or what­
ever folder you told Thunderbird to put suspected spam into in Step 4 in 
the previous section). The Junk mail folder appears on your list of folders, 
below your Inbox, Templates (form letters you send out), and Sent folders. 
Click the Junk folder to see the list of messages. You don’t need to open 
each message — reviewing the sender names and subjects is usually enough 
to find any good messages mixed in there.
If you see a good message in your Junk folder, select it and click the Not 
Junk button on the toolbar. (It’s where the Junk button usually is — the 
button turns into Not Junk when you open the Junk folder.) This button tells 
Thunderbird to look at this message and to adjust the filters accordingly. 
Then drag the message back into your Inbox. When you’re sure that all mes­
sages in your Junk folder are indeed junk, delete them. An easy way to do 
it is to click the first message and then scroll down and Shift+click the last 
message — now all the messages in the Junk folder are selected. Press the 
Del key or click the Delete button on the toolbar to trash them.
Filtering spam in Windows (Live) Mail
Neither Windows Live Mail (which comes with Windows Live Essentials) nor 
Windows Mail (which comes with Vista) have Bayesian filters, but they have 
a number of other spam-fighting features:
	
✓	Junk E-Mail Options: You can adjust the built-in spam filters.
	
✓	Blocked Senders list: If you receive a message from anyone on this list, 
the message goes right into the trash.
	
✓	Safe Senders list: Messages from people on this list don’t get marked as 
spam, even if the message looks like spam.

240
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
The following sections describe how to use these features.
Configuring your junk e-mail options
To configure the built-in junk mail filter, follow these steps:
	
1.	In Windows Live Mail, click the Menu icon and choose Safety Options. 
In Windows Mail, choose Tools➪Junk E-Mail Options. Click the 
Options tab if it isn’t already selected.
	
	 You should see the Safety Options or Junk E-Mail Options window.
	
2.	Select Low to pick the normal junk filter setting.
	
	 You can try High, but we find that it catches too much nonspam.
	
3.	Click the Phishing tab.
	
4.	Select Protect My Inbox from Messages with Potential Phishing Links 
if it’s not already set.
	
	 This feature is useful, but it raises some privacy concerns. Because it 
checks any Web URLs in the message against a list of known phishing 
sites maintained by Microsoft, the link information in your mail is sent to 
Microsoft for checking.
	
5.	Click OK.
	
You can use the Safe Senders and Blocked Senders tabs to list addresses of 
people whose mail you always and never want, respectively. On the Options 
tab of this window, click Safe List Only to accept mail only from people listed 
on the Safe Senders tab. This setting is way too restrictive for adults, but is 
appropriate for children, so you can set up a list of the friends and relatives 
from whom you expect them to be receiving mail.
The International tab lets you block mail from addresses from certain top-
level domains (the part of the e-mail address after the last dot) and in certain 
language encodings. We don’t recommend the domain blocking, which tends 
to block more mail than you want, but if you don’t speak Korean (or Arabic, 
Chinese, Greek, Vietnamese, or another language in the list) and don’t know 
anyone in Korea, you can somewhat safely tell it to block mail encoded as 
Korean. Don’t tell it to block US_ASCII or Western European or else you’ll 
block most of your real mail.
Blocking messages by sender
In Windows Live Mail, right-click the message in the message list and choose 
Junk E-Mail➪Add Sender to Blocked Senders List. If you’ve opened the mes­
sage in a separate window, click Junk.
In Windows Mail, open the message and choose Message➪Junk Email➪Add 
Sender to Blocked Senders List.

241
 Chapter 14: Keeping Your Mail Safe from Viruses, Spam, and Wi-Fi Snoops
The message you opened is still in your inbox; the program will block future 
messages, but doesn’t do anything about this one. Just delete it! Blocking 
by sender is occasionally useful to deal with real people who send mail that 
is never interesting (see the sidebar on chain letters) but useless for spam 
since spammers never use the same address twice.
Viewing your Blocked Senders list
You can look at or edit the Blocked Senders list later, in case you add a friend 
accidentally or you want to type a bunch of spammer addresses. In Windows 
Live Mail, click the Menu icon and choose Safety Options. In Windows Mail, 
choose Tools➪Junk E-Mail Options from the menu bar in the main window. 
Click the Blocked Senders tab to see the list of senders you have blocked. 
Messages from any addresses on this list are shunted straight to your 
Deleted Items folder.
You can add more addresses to your Blocked Senders list by clicking the 
Add button and typing or pasting the address in the dialog box that appears. 
If you decide to accept messages from an address after all, you can delete it 
from the list by choosing the address and clicking Remove.
Blocking messages from entire domains
The Blocked Senders list can include entire domains. (A domain is the part 
of an e-mail address after the @.) For example, if you don’t want to receive 
any mail from the White House, you can block all messages that come from 
anything@whitehouse.gov. Follow these steps to block all messages 
from an entire domain:
	
1.	Display the Blocked Senders list, as described in the preceding section.
	
2.	Click the Add button.
	
	 You see the Add Sender dialog box.
	
3.	Type the domain name and click OK.
	
	 (In Windows Mail, leave the Mail Messages radio button selected.) When 
you click OK, the new entry appears on your Blocked Senders list.
Reviewing your spam
From time to time, be sure to look through the messages that have been iden­
tified and filed as spam. Perfectly innocent messages may have been misla­
beled as spam.
To look in your Junk E-mail folder, click it on the folder list. The list of mes­
sages in that folder appears. Scroll through the messages; the unread mes­
sages appear in bold. (Spam you never saw should all appear in bold.) If you 
see any good messages, select each one and click Not Junk to put them back 
in your Inbox.

Sneaky ways that spammers evade filters
Spammers are smart — if they weren’t, out­
raged Internet users would have shut them 
down long ago. Every time spam filterers come 
up with another way to spot spam, spammers 
change what they send out. It’s like a sped-up 
version of e-mail evolution.
Here are some tricks that spammers use to 
prevent your filters from catching their junk 
messages:
	✓	Funky capitalization: Most mail filter pro­
grams look for the exact capitalization you 
specify. If your filter looks for spammers
rus.com on the From line, you don’t catch 
messages from SpammersRus.com or 
spaMmersruS.com.
	✓	No text: Many spam messages contain 
almost no text — just a graphical image 
of text. When text is sent as a graphical 
image, filters can’t read the text to spot the 
phrases you’re looking for.
	✓	Wrods Speled w.r.0.n.g: People are remark­
ably good at making sense of garbled text, 
so it’s not hard to garble text enough to 
defeat filters and remain legible to people.
	✓	Hidden bogus codes: E-mail messages can 
contain HTML formatting codes, which are 
enclosed in <angle brackets>. These for­
matting codes can create bold (using the 
<b> code) and italic (using <i>) text in your 
messages. However, lots of codes have no 
meaning in HTML, such as <m> and <n>, 
so your e-mail program ignores them when 
displaying messages. However, if these 
meaningless codes are sprinkled in your 
messages, your filters are prevented from 
finding the words you have flagged. For 
example, a filter that’s looking for make 
money doesn’t match a message that con­
tains ma<m>ke mon<n>ey.

243
 Chapter 14: Keeping Your Mail Safe from Viruses, Spam, and Wi-Fi Snoops
We believe that spam is not just a technical problem and that only a combi­
nation of technical, social, and legal solutions will work in the long run. In the 
meantime, every ISP now does at least some spam filtering on incoming mail, 
and many let you “tune” their filters. Check with your ISP for the specific ser­
vices it provides.
How Private Is E-Mail?
Relatively, but not totally. Any recipient of your mail may forward it to other 
people. Some mail addresses are actually mailing lists that redistribute mes­
sages to many other people. We’ve gotten misrouted mail in our inter­
net12@gurus.org mailbox with details of our correspondents’ lives and 
anatomies that they probably would rather we forget. (So we did.)
If you send mail from work or to someone at work, your mail isn’t private 
because companies have the right to read all employee e-mail that passes 
through their systems. You and your friend may work for companies of the 
highest integrity whose employees would never dream of reading private 
e-mail. When push comes to shove, however, and someone is accusing your 
company of leaking confidential information and the corporate lawyer says 
“Examine the e-mail,” someone reads all the e-mail. (This situation happened 
to a friend of ours who was none too pleased to find that all his intimate cor­
respondence with his fiancée had been read.) E-mail you send and receive 
is stored on your disk, and most companies back up their disks regularly. 
One-click surfing, but no phishing
Most e-mail programs convert URLs (Web site 
addresses) in your e-mail messages into links 
to the actual Web sites. You don’t have to type 
these addresses into your browser. All you have 
to do is click the highlighted link in the e-mail 
message and — poof — your browser opens 
and you’re at the Web site. If your e-mail pro­
gram has this feature (all programs mentioned 
in this chapter do), URLs in e-mail messages 
appear underlined and in blue — a nice feature.
Unfortunately, this feature is abused by phish­
ers. Phishing is sending faked e-mail that claims 
to be from your bank or another official organi­
zation to trick you into revealing personal infor­
mation, and we describe it in Chapter 2. If you 
click one of these links and it opens a Web site 
that asks for a password or credit card number 
or the like, don’t give it any information!
Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, and Windows 
Mail have phish detection features. The fea­
tures aren’t perfect, but if either one says that a 
link looks phishy, you probably shouldn’t click it.

244
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
If anybody wants to read your mail, it’s not hard to do. The usual rule is not 
to send anything you wouldn’t want to see posted next to the water cooler or 
perhaps scribbled next to a pay phone.
Secure That Mail
If you have a laptop and you use it to read your e-mail in public Wi-Fi hot­
spots, you may have a security problem. (Refer to the section in Chapter 5 
about getting Wi-Fi with your latté to find out what we mean by Wi-Fi and hot­
spot.) Public Wi-Fi setups allow anyone connected to the same hotspot (that 
is, anyone in the same café or area of the airport) to eavesdrop on what you 
type, including potentially seeing your e-mail username and password.
Fortunately, most mail programs and mail servers let you use a secure con­
nection, the same kind that secure Web pages use, for incoming and outgoing 
mail. Setting up the secure connection can be a little tricky, but you have to 
do it only once.
Secure webmail — or maybe not
You’d think that webmail services would use secure Web sites, but you’d 
be wrong in some cases. If you use Gmail, you can click Settings and scroll 
down the list of General settings until you see the Browser Connection set­
ting; set it to Always Use Https (the secure version of the HTTP Web brows­
ing protocol).
Secure mail with Thunderbird
To set up secure mail in Thunderbird, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Tools➪Account Settings.
	
	 You see the Account Settings window, with a list of your mail accounts 
on the left.
	
2.	Click Server Settings under your incoming mail account.
	
	 You may have to click the little + sign next to your account’s name to 
see the Server Settings option.
	
3.	Select the Use Secure Connection (SSL) check box.

245
 Chapter 14: Keeping Your Mail Safe from Viruses, Spam, and Wi-Fi Snoops
	
4.	Click Outgoing Server (SMTP) at the bottom of the left column.
	
	 If you have several accounts set up, you may have to scroll down to 
find it.
	
5.	Click Edit.
	
6.	Under Use Secure Connection, select TLS.
	
7.	Click OK.
Now check your mail and try sending yourself a message. If it doesn’t work, 
your mail provider may not offer secure mail, or it may offer it in a nonstan­
dard way, and you have to call for help.
Secure mail with Windows Live Mail
To set up secure mail in Windows Live Mail, follow these steps:
	
1.	Right-click the account name in the left column (for example, Hotmail) 
and choose Properties from the menu that appears.
	
	 You see the Properties dialog box for that account.
	
2.	Click the Advanced tab, shown in Figure 14-4.

	 If the check box isn’t checked, click it.

246

4.	Change the Outgoing Mail (SMTP) port number to 465.
	
5.	Change the Incoming Mail (IMAP) port number to 993, or the 
Incoming Mail (POP3) port number to 995.
	
6.	Click OK to save your settings.
Secure mail with Windows Mail
To set up secure mail in Windows Mail, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Tools➪Accounts.
	
2.	Click the name of your mail account in the window that opens, and 
then click Properties.
	
3.	In the window that opens, click the Advanced tab.
	
	 There’s a Security tab, but that’s not the one you want here.
	
4.	Select the check boxes labeled This Server Requires a Secure 
Connection (SSL) for both incoming and outgoing mail.
	
5.	Click OK.
Now check your mail and try sending yourself a message, clicking the Send/
Receive button to make Windows Mail connect to the server. If it doesn’t 
work, your mail provider may not offer secure mail, or may offer it in a non­
standard way, and you have to call for help.

A
fter you get used to using e-mail, you start sending and receiving 
enough messages that you had better keep it organized. This chapter 
describes how to delete, reply to, forward, and file messages in Thunderbird, 
Windows Live Mail (which comes with Windows Live Essentials), Windows 
Mail (which comes with Windows Vista), and webmail systems such as 
Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, AIM Mail, and Hotmail. (Refer to Chapter 13 to find out 
how to get started using these programs.)
After you read (or decide not to read) an e-mail message, you can deal with it 
in a number of ways, much the same as with paper mail. Here are your usual 
choices:
	
✓	Throw it away (as described in Chapter 13).
	
✓	Mark it as spam (as described in Chapter 14) so that your program and 
sometimes your mail provider can learn to identify spam before you 
even have to see it.
	
✓	Reply to it.
	
✓	Forward it to other people.
	
✓	File it.
You can do any or all these things with each message. If you don’t tell your 
mail program what to do with a message, the message usually stays in your 
mailbox for later perusal.

A Few Words from the Etiquette Ladies
Sadly, the Great Ladies of Etiquette, such as Emily Post and Amy Vanderbilt, 
died before the invention of e-mail. Here’s what they may have suggested 
about what to say and, more important, what not to say in e-mail.
E-mail is a funny hybrid, something between a phone call (or voice mail) 
and a letter. On one hand, it’s quick and usually informal; on the other hand, 
because e-mail is written rather than spoken, you don’t see a person’s facial 
expressions or hear her tone of voice.
	
A few words of advice:
	
✓	When you send a message, watch the tone of your language.
	
✓	Don’t use all capital letters — it looks like you’re SHOUTING.
	
✓	If someone sends you an incredibly obnoxious and offensive message, 
as likely as not it’s a mistake or a joke gone awry. In particular, be on the 
lookout for failed sarcasm.
Flame off!
Pointless and excessive outrage in e-mail is so common that it has a name of 
its own: flaming. Don’t flame. It makes you look like a jerk.
	
When you get a message so offensive that you just have to reply, stick it back 
in your inbox for a while and wait until after lunch. Then . . . don’t flame back. 
The sender probably didn’t realize how the message would look. In about 20 
years of using e-mail, we can testify that we have never, ever, regretted not 
sending an angry message (although we have regretted sending a few — 
ouch).
When you’re sending e-mail, keep in mind that the person reading it will have 
no idea what you intended to say — just what you did say. Subtle sarcasm 
and irony are almost impossible to use in e-mail and usually come across as 
annoying or dumb instead. (If you’re an extremely superb writer, you can dis­
regard this advice — but don’t say that we didn’t warn you.)
Another possibility to keep in the back of your mind is that it’s technically 
easy to forge e-mail return addresses. If you get a totally off-the-wall message 
that seems out of character for the person who sent it, somebody else may 
have forged it as a prank. (No, we don’t tell you how to forge e-mail. How 
dumb do you think we are?)

 Chapter 15: Putting Your Mail in Its Place
Smile!
	
Sometimes, a :-) (a smiley or an emoticon) can help clarify your meaning. It 
means “This is a joke.” (Try tilting your head to the left if you don’t see why 
it’s a smile.) In some communities, <g> or <grin> serves the same purpose. 
Here’s a typical example:
People who don’t believe that we are all part of a warm,
caring community who love and support each other are no
better than rabid dogs and should be hunted down and shot.
:-)
We feel that any joke that needs a smiley probably wasn’t worth making, but 
tastes differ.
For more guidance about online etiquette, see our net.gurus.org/
netiquette Web page.
BTW, what does IMHO mean? RTFM!
E-mail users are often lazy typists, and abbreviations are common. Here are some of the most 
widely used:

Back to You, Sam: Replying to Mail
Replying to mail is easy: Choose Message➪Reply in Thunderbird or click 
Reply in Windows Live Mail or choose Message➪Reply to Sender in Windows 
Mail. Pressing Ctrl+R (Ô+R on the Mac) works in some mail programs, too. In 
webmail, you usually see a Reply button.
After you open the reply message, ask yourself two important questions:
	
✓	To whom does the reply go? Look carefully at the To line, which your 
mail program has filled out for you. Is that who you thought you were 
addressing? If the reply is addressed to a mailing list, did you truly 
intend to send a message to the entire list, or is your reply of a more 
personal nature, intended only for the individual who sent the message? 
Did you mean to reply to a group? Are all the addresses that you think 
you’re replying to included on the To list? If the To list isn’t correct, 
click it and edit it as necessary.
	
	Occasionally, you may receive a message that has been sent to a zillion 
people and their addresses appear in dozens of lines in the To section of 
the message. If you reply to a message such as this one, make sure that 
your reply isn’t addressed to the entire huge list of recipients.
	
	Some mail programs have a separate Reply to All command or button 
that addresses your reply to the people that the message was from and 
the people who received copies of the message (the “To” people and the 
“Cc” people). Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, and Windows Mail all 
have a Reply All button on their toolbars,
	
✓	Do you want to include the content of the message to which you’re 
replying? Most mail programs include the content of the message to 
which you’re replying, usually formatted to show that it’s a quotation 
or quoted text. Edit the quoted text to include just the relevant material, 
so as not to bore or confuse the recipient with unrelated stuff. If you 
don’t provide some context to people who get a great deal of e-mail, 
your reply makes no sense, so including part of the original message can 
be helpful. If you’re answering a question, include the question in the 
response. You don’t have to include the entire text, but give your reader 
a break. She may have read 50 messages since she sent you mail and 
may not have a clue what you’re talking about unless you remind her.
When you reply to a message, most mail programs fill in the Subject field 
with the letters Re: (short for regarding) and the Subject field contents of the 
message to which you’re replying. Type your message above the quoted text 
from the original message and click Send.

251
 Chapter 15: Putting Your Mail in Its Place
Keeping Track of Your Friends
After you begin using e-mail, you quickly find that you have enough regu­
lar correspondents that keeping track of their e-mail addresses is a pain. 
Fortunately, every popular e-mail program provides an address book or con­
tacts list in which you can save your friends’ addresses so that you can send 
mail to Mom, for example, and have it automatically addressed to chairman@
exec.hq.giantcorp.com. You can also create address lists so that you can 
send mail to family, for example, and it goes to Mom, Dad, your brother, 
both sisters, and your dog, all of whom have e-mail addresses.
All address books let you do the same things:
	
✓	Save in your address book the address from a message you have just 
read.
	
✓	Use addresses you have saved for outgoing messages.
	
✓	Edit your address book.
Some address books also provide space for you to store other information 
about your friends and coworkers.
Who’s who
Click the Address Book or Contacts icon or link to see your address book. (In 
Windows Mail, it looks like a little flag.) Most programs open a new window 
for your contacts list. Figure 15-1 shows the Windows Live Mail contacts list 
for a Hotmail webmail account. In most address books, you double-click a 
contact to edit the person’s information.

Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Here’s how to add people to your address book:
	
✓	Thunderbird: Click New Card and fill out the form. To edit an entry, 
select it and click the Properties button on the toolbar. You can also 
create a list — that is, an address book entry that sends a message to a 
bunch of people (for example, the members of a committee or of your 
family). To create a mailing list for your use, click the New List button, 
which creates an empty list, and then type the addresses you want.
	
	When you’re reading a message, you can add the sender’s address to 
your address book by clicking the sender’s name or address on the From 
line and choosing Add to Address Book from the menu that pops up.
	
✓	Windows Live Mail: Click Contacts to see your contacts list, and then 
click New to create a new contact. Fill out the information and click Add 
Contact. When you’re reading a message and want to save the sender’s 
name in your contacts list, right-click the person’s name and choose 
Add to Contacts or Add Sender to Contacts from the menu that appears.
	
✓	Windows Mail: Click the New Contact button and fill in as much info 
as you want in the Properties window that opens. To add an e-mail 
address, type it in the E-mail box and then click the Add button to the 
right of that box. After you enter the contact info (the name and one 
e-mail address are plenty), click OK. To change an entry, just click it in 
the Contacts window, and a Properties window opens, where you can 
change it.
	
	To add an address from a message in a mailbox, right-click the person’s 
name or address in the list of messages and then choose Add Sender to 
Contacts from the menu that appears.
	
✓	Webmail: Click the Contacts, Contact List, Addresses, or Address 
Book link to display your address book. Click the Add Contact, Create 
Contact, or New button or the little plus sign or similar icon or link to 
add someone. Fill out the form that appears, and be sure to enter a nick­
name for the person: You can type the nickname when addressing an 
e-mail message rather than type the person’s whole e-mail address. The 
form may include fields for the person’s postal address and phone num­
bers, but you can leave them blank. Then click the Save or Save Contact 
button. (These instructions are approximate because webmail sites 
change their designs all the time.)
Addressing messages the easy way
Composing a message is when you really want to use your address book, 
because who can remember all those weird e-mail addresses your friends 
pick? When you’re writing a new message (or replying to or forwarding a 
message, as described later in this chapter), here’s what to do:

253
 Chapter 15: Putting Your Mail in Its Place
	
✓	Thunderbird: Just start typing the person’s name in your new message. 
As soon as Thunderbird sees a name that begins with the same letters 
as an address book entry, it displays the person’s name. If more than 
one entry matches, you see a list you can choose from.
	
✓	Windows Live Mail and Windows Mail: Click the little flag or book icon 
to the left of the To, Cc, or Bcc line, and a Select Recipients window 
opens. Double-click the one or ones you want, and then click OK to 
return to the message.
	
✓	Webmail: Webmail systems provide several ways to address a message 
to someone in your address book. In Yahoo! Mail, you can display a list 
of your contacts. When composing a message, try typing the person’s 
nickname to see whether a matching entry appears in the window of 
address book entries or click the To or Cc button to see a list of contacts 
from which to choose.
Hot Potatoes: Forwarding Mail
You can forward e-mail to someone else. It’s easy. It’s cheap. Forwarding is 
one of the best things about e-mail and at the same time one of the worst. 
It’s good because you can easily pass along messages to people who need to 
know about them. It’s bad because you (not you personally, but, um, people 
around you — that’s it) can just as easily send out floods of messages to 
recipients who would just as soon not hear another press release from the 
local Ministry of Truth or another joke that’s making the rounds. Think about 
whether you will enhance someone’s quality of life by forwarding a message 
to him. If a message says “forward this to everyone you know,” do everyone 
you know a favor and delete it instead.
Forwarding a message involves wrapping the message in a new message of 
your own, sort of like putting sticky notes all over a copy of it and mailing the 
copy and notes to someone else.
Forwarding mail is almost as easy as replying to it: Select the message and 
click the Forward button on the toolbar or choose Message➪Forward. Pressing 
Ctrl+L (Ô+L on the Mac) also works in Thunderbird, and Ctrl+F forwards in 
Windows Live Mail and Windows Mail. In webmail systems, a Forward button 
usually appears when you view a message. The mail program composes a mes­
sage that contains the text of the message you want to forward; all you have to 
do is address the message, add a few snappy comments, and send it.
The text of the original message appears at the top or bottom of the message, 
usually formatted as quoted text and preceded by a line that specifies whom 
the original message was from, and when. You then get to edit the message 
and add your own comments. (See the nearby sidebar “Fast forward” for tips 
about pruning forwarded mail.)

254
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Cold Potatoes: Saving Mail
Saving e-mail for later reference is similar to putting potatoes in the fridge 
for later. (Don’t knock it if you haven’t tried it — day-old boiled potatoes 
are yummy with enough butter or sour cream.) Lots of your e-mail is worth 
saving, just as lots of your paper mail is worth saving. Lots of it isn’t, of 
course, but that’s what the Delete icon is for.
Fast forward
Whenever you’re forwarding mail, be sure to 
delete uninteresting parts. All the glop in the 
message header is frequently included auto­
matically in the forwarded message, and almost 
none of it is comprehensible, much less inter­
esting, so get rid of it.
The tricky part is editing the text. If the message 
is short (a screenful or so), you probably should 
leave it alone:
>Is there a lot of demand for 
fruit pizza?
>
I checked with our research 
department and found 
that the favorite 
pizza toppings in the 
18-34 age group are 
pepperoni, sausage, 
ham, pineapple, olives, 
peppers, sauerkraut, 
hamburger, and broccoli. 
I specifically asked about 
prunes, and they found no 
statistically significant 
response.
If the message is long and only part of it is rel­
evant, you should, as a courtesy to the reader, 
cut it down to the interesting part. We can tell 
you from experience that people pay much 
more attention to a concise, one-line e-mail 
message than they do to 12 pages of quoted 
stuff followed by a two-line question.
Sometimes it makes sense to edit material even 
more, particularly to emphasize a specific part. 
When you do so, of course, be sure not to edit 
to the point where you put words in the original 
author’s mouth or garble the sense of the mes­
sage, as in the following reply:
>I checked with
>our research department and 
found that the
>favorite pizza toppings ... 
and they
>found no statistically 
significant
>response.
This version of the original message is totally 
misleading — it twists the original text. 
Sometimes, it makes sense to paraphrase a 
little — in that case, put the paraphrased part 
in square brackets, like this:
>[When asked about prunes on 
pizza, research]
>found no statistically 
significant response.
People disagree about whether paraphrasing 
to shorten quotes is a good idea. On one hand, 
if you do it well, it saves everyone time. On the 
other hand, if you do it badly and someone takes 
offense, you’re in for a week of accusations and 
apologies that will wipe out whatever time you 
may have saved. The decision is yours.

255
 Chapter 15: Putting Your Mail in Its Place
You can save e-mail in a few different ways:
	
✓	Save it in a folder full of messages.
	
✓	Print it and put it in a file cabinet with paper mail. (Spare a tree; don’t 
use this method.)
The easiest method usually is to stick messages in a folder. E-mail programs 
usually come with folders named In (or Inbox), Outbox, Sent, and Trash, and 
perhaps others. But you can also make your own folders.
People use two general approaches in filing mail: by sender and by topic. 
Whether you use one or the other or both is mostly a matter of taste. For 
filing by topic, it’s entirely up to you to come up with folder names. The most 
difficult part is coming up with memorable names. If you aren’t careful, you 
end up with four folders with slightly different names, each with a quarter of 
the messages about a particular topic.
Gmail takes a different tack — it saves all your mail in one huge folder. When 
you want to find an old message, you search for it by sender or by some text 
in the message. This method sure saves filing!
	
You can save all or part of a message by copying it into a text file or word pro­
cessing document. Select the text of the message by using your mouse. Press 
Ctrl+C (Ô+C on a Mac) or choose Edit➪Copy to copy the text to the Clipboard. 
Switch to your word processor (or whatever program in which you want to 
copy the text) and press Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) or choose Edit➪Paste to 
make the message appear where the cursor is.
Filing messages with Thunderbird
Thunderbird lists your mail folders down the left side of the window, starting 
with Inbox. Thunderbird provides folders named Inbox, Unsent Messages, 
Drafts, Sent, and Trash, but you can create your own folders. If you have a lot 
of messages to file, you can even create folders within folders to keep things 
organized. To make a new folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose File➪New➪New Folder.
	
	 You see the New Folder dialog box.
	
2.	Type a name for the folder in the Name text box.
	
	 Make one named Personal, just to give it a try.
	
3.	Set the Create As a Subfolder Of drop-down box to the folder name in 
which you want the new folder to live.

256
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
	
	 Usually, you want your folder to be a subfolder of Local Folders, so set 
it to Local Folders and click Choose This for the Parent. Or, choose 
another folder; for example, you can have a folder named Personal, and 
inside that can be a folder for each friend you receive messages from.
	
4.	Click OK.
The new folder appears on the list of folders on the left side of the 
Thunderbird window. You can see the list of message headers for any folder 
by clicking the folder name.
You can save a message in a folder by dragging the message to the folder 
name — easy enough. Or, right-click the message, choose Move To from the 
menu that appears, and choose the folder from the list that appears.
	
When you compose a message, you can tell Thunderbird to save a copy of 
your message in a folder. While writing the message, choose Options➪Send a 
Copy To and then choose a folder.
Filing messages with Windows 
Live Mail and Windows Mail
You start out with folders named Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, Drafts, Deleted 
Items, and Junk E-Mail. To make a new folder:
	
✓	In Windows Live Mail, click the little down arrow next to the New button 
and choose Folder.
	
✓	In Windows Mail, choose File➪Folder➪New or File➪New➪Folder.
Either way, give the folder a name and choose which folder to put this new 
folder in. (You can have folders within folders — very convenient.)
Move messages into a folder by clicking a message header and dragging it 
over to the folder name or by right-clicking the message on the message list 
and choosing Move to Folder.
Filing messages with webmail systems
Webmail systems change every time the company decides to redesign the 
Web site, but here’s how the popular webmail system worked the last time we 
checked.

257
 Chapter 15: Putting Your Mail in Its Place
Your folders appear in the list of folders down the left side of your browser 
window, under the My Folders heading. Your folders include names like 
Inbox, Sent, Draft, Spam, and Trash. Click a folder name to see the messages 
in that folder. To save a message in a folder, drag it from the list of messages 
into the new folder, like in a real mail program. To create a new folder, click 
the Add link to the right of My Folders, or in Hotmail, click Manage Folders 
and then click New.
With Gmail, rather than put mail into folders, you label it. All the mail with 
the same label acts sort of like a folder. Click the Labels button and choose 
from the list. If you’re creating a new label, click the Labels button, choose 
Manage Labels, scroll down to the Create a New Label box, type a name, and 
click the Create button.
Handling Exotic Mail and 
Mail Attachments
Sooner or later, just plain, old, everyday e-mail isn’t good enough for you: 
Someone will send you a picture you just have to see, or you will want to 
send a video clip of Fluffy to your new best friend in Paris. To send stuff other 
than text through the mail, a message uses special file formats. Sometimes 
the entire message is in a special format, and sometimes people attach things 
to their plain text mail. The usual format for attaching files to messages is 
MIME, or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. The programs we describe 
in this chapter can send and receive files attached with MIME, as do most 
e-mail programs on the planet — only a few, very old e-mail programs can’t.
When you receive a file that’s attached to an e-mail message, your mail 
program is responsible for noticing the attached file and doing something 
intelligent with it. Most of the time, your program saves the attached file as a 
separate file in the folder you specify. After the file has been saved, you can 
use it just like you use any other file. If you see a picture in a message and 
you’re not sure where it’s saved, most programs let you right-click the pic­
ture and choose Save Image As to put the picture in the folder of your choice.
These types of files are often sent as attachments:
	
✓	Pictures, in image files
	
✓	Word processing documents
	
✓	PDF files (printable, viewable formatted documents)
	
✓	Sounds, in audio files

258
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
	
✓	Movies, in video files
	
✓	Programs, in executable files
	
✓	Compressed files, such as zip files
	
E-mail viruses usually show up as attachments. If you receive a message with 
an unexpected attachment, even from someone you know, DON’T OPEN IT 
until you check with the sender to make sure she sent it deliberately. Viruses 
often suck all the addresses from a victim’s address book so that the virus can 
mail itself to the victim’s friends. Some kinds of attachments can’t carry 
viruses — notably, GIF and JPG images. Refer to Chapter 14 for details.
Your ISP or webmail service may place a limit on the size of your mailbox 
(the place on its server where your messages are stored until you pick them 
up). Google Gmail and Yahoo! Mail have high limits, so other mail systems 
have been increasing their limits to match, but you may still run into a size 
limit if someone sends you a truly gigantic file, such as a video file. One way 
to shrink the size of attached files is to zip them first. Read the sidebar in 
Chapter 12 about uncompressing and unzipping files if you receive a zipped 
file (with the file extension .zip).
	
When you receive a picture as an attachment, it’s sometimes so large that all 
you see in your message window is one corner of a picture that would mea­
sure about 4 feet by 6 feet if viewed in its entirely, as shown in Figure 15-2. 
When this happens, right-click the picture and save it as a separate file, and 
then view it using another program.
	
Figure 15-2: 
Pictures 
can show 
up looking 
enormous 
in your 
program.
	
Thunderbird attachments
To attach a file to the message you’re composing, click the Attach button 
or choose File➪Attach. Then select the file you want to send. Or, just drag 
the file from an Explorer window or the desktop into the message composi­
tion window. You can insert a picture directly into the text of the message 

259
 Chapter 15: Putting Your Mail in Its Place
by positioning the cursor where you want the picture to appear, choosing 
Insert➪Image, and specifying the filename.
For incoming mail, Thunderbird displays any attachments that it can dis­
play itself (Web pages and GIF and JPEG image files). For other types of 
attachments, it displays a little description of the file, which you can click. 
Thunderbird then runs an appropriate display program — if it knows of 
one — or asks you whether to save the attachment to a file or to configure 
a display program, which Thunderbird then runs in order to display the 
attachment.
Windows Live Mail and Windows 
Mail attachments
In Windows Mail, create a new message and then attach a file to the message 
by clicking the Attach button. (In Windows Mail, the Attach button, which 
looks like a paper clip, might be off the right side of the toolbar — make the 
Composition window wider to display it.) Then select the file to attach. Or, 
just drag the file into the New Message window. Then send the message as 
usual.
When an incoming message contains an attachment, a paper-clip icon 
appears in the message on your list of incoming messages and in the mes­
sage header when you view the message. Click the paper clip to see the 
filename — double-click and you may be able to see the attachment.
Microsoft has “solved” some chronic security problems by making Windows 
Mail refuse to show you certain attachments, including a lot of benign ones, 
such as attached text messages and PDF files. You can sort of fix this prob­
lem by choosing Menu➪Safety Options (in Windows Live Mail; the Menu icon 
is to the left the question-mark icon) or Tools➪Options (in Windows Mail). 
Then click the Security tab and deselect Do Not Allow Attachments to Be 
Saved or Opened That Could Potentially Be a Virus. Now the program lets 
you open your attachments, although of course when someone does send 
you a virus, it cheerfully opens that one, too.
Webmail attachments
To attach stuff with most webmail sites, compose a message as usual. Then 
click the Attach button and select the file. (You might need to click Browse 
first, to find the file.) Your Web browser, amazing beast that it is, copies the 
file right off your hard drive and sends it to the Yahoo! Mail system to include 
in your message. When the file is done uploading, the filename appears just 
below the subject line. Send the message as usual.

260
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
When you receive a message with attachments, a paper clip may indicate that 
a file came along for the ride. If it’s a picture, the browser usually displays 
the picture directly in the message, or you might have to click a Show Images 
button. The filename of the attached file also appears, and you can click it, or 
a View or Download link, to open or save the file.
Teaching Your E-Mail Program 
to Sort Your Mail
After you begin sending e-mail, you probably will find that you receive quite 
a bit of it, particularly if you put yourself on some mailing lists (see Chapter 
16). Your incoming mail becomes a trickle, and then a stream, and then a 
torrent, and pretty soon you can’t walk past your keyboard without getting 
soaking wet, metaphorically speaking.
Fortunately, most mail systems provide ways for you to manage the flow and 
avoid ruining your clothes. (Enough of this metaphor already.) Thunderbird 
can create filters that can automatically check incoming messages against a 
list of senders and subjects and file them in appropriate folders. Windows 
Mail has Message Rules, which can sort your mail automatically. Most other 
mail programs (and a few webmail systems) have similar filtering features. If 
you sort mail into separate mailboxes for each mailing list or other category, 
you can deal with it a lot more efficiently.
For example, you can create filters that tell your mail program, “Any message 
that comes from the CHICKENS-L mailing list should be automatically filed in 
the Cluck mail folder.” Figure 15-3 shows this type of filter in Thunderbird.
Corresponding with a robot
Not every mail address has a live person 
behind it. Some addresses belong to mailing 
lists (which we talk about in Chapter 16), and 
some are robots (or mailbots) — programs that 
automatically reply to messages. Mail robots 
are a common way of subscribing or leav­
ing a mailing list, and for the occasional other 
arcane purpose. You send a message to the 
robot (usually referred to as a mailbot or mail 
server), it takes some action based on the 
contents of your message, and then the robot 
sends back a response. If you send a message 
to internet12@gurus.org, for example, 
you receive a response telling you your e-mail 
address. See Chapter 16 for more details on 
mailing lists.

You can create filters to highlight messages from particularly interesting 
friends, or delete certain messages (you know the ones we mean) so that you 
never have to see them. You first choose a condition, which enables the pro­
gram to identify messages based on the From line, Subject line, or message 
body. Then you select an action, which is usually to move the message to a 
folder. (Remember that Trash is a folder.) Here’s how to make a filter or mes­
sage rule for the main e-mail programs we discuss in this book:
	
✓	Thunderbird: Choose Tools➪Message Filters to display the Message 
Filters window, where you can see, create, edit, and delete filters. Click 
New to create a new filter, and then specify a filter name (for your own 
reference), how Thunderbird can match incoming messages to this 
filter, and what to do with messages that match. Or, click the To or From 
address in a message and choose Create Filter from Message to make a 
filter for mail sent to or from that address.
	
✓	Windows Mail and Windows Live Mail: Choose Tools➪Message Rules➪
Mail. (You may have to tap the Alt key to see the menu bar so that you 
can select Tools.) The bottom part of the window that opens shows a 
description of what to the filter will do. Because you haven’t yet told 
it what messages to look for or where to move the message, clickable 
placeholders appear in the description. Click each one to enter the 
words to match and the folder to use. Then click OK. This method is a 
lot simpler in practice than it is to describe; try making a rule to move 
messages with pickle in the subject line into a folder named Pickles and 
you’ll get the hang of it.
	
✓	Yahoo! Mail: Click the Options button on the Yahoo! Mail Web page 
and then the Mail Options entry on the menu that drops down, and then 
click the Filters heading. You can create, edit, or delete your filters.

All this automatic-sorting nonsense may seem like overkill, and if you receive 
only five or ten messages a day, it is. After the mail starts flowing, however, 
dealing with it takes much more of your time than it used to. Keep those 
automated tools in mind — if not for now, then for later.

nternet e-mail is pretty fast, usually arriving in less than a minute. But 
sometimes that’s just not fast enough. Instant-message (IM) systems let 
you pop up a message on a friend’s screen in a matter of seconds. You can 
also tell your instant-message program the usernames of your friends and 
colleagues so that the program can alert you the instant that one of your 
buddies comes online and you can instantiate an instant message to them. 
(Excuse us, this gives us a headache. Wait just a moment while we get some 
instant coffee. Ahh, that’s better.)
The good thing about instant messages is that you can stay in touch with 
people as fast as by talking to them on the phone. The bad thing about 
instant messages is that they also offer an unparalleled range of ways to 
annoy people. AOL Instant Messenger, discussed later in this chapter, has 
about two features to send and receive messages, and about 12 features to 
reject, denounce, erase, and otherwise deal with unwanted messages. (This 
may say more about AOL users than about the technology, of course.)
Gregarious people can chat with a whole bunch of people at once, by either 
typing at the same time, like a party line, or sending messages to each other 
by e-mail or Web forums.
Of course, even better than typing messages to another person is talking 
right out loud. If your computer has a microphone and speakers, you can 
use IM or other systems to talk to people over the Net — even groups of 
people — with no toll charges. If you connect a digital video camera (or 
Webcam) to your computer, your friends can even see you as you talk or 
type. It’s not hard to do!

264
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
AIMing to Chat via Text
Instant messaging (IM) lets you type short messages that appear in a window on 
someone else’s computer. It’s faster than e-mail but slightly less intrusive than a 
phone call — whoever heard of people having their secretaries screen their IMs?
This chapter describes how to use the most popular IM system: AOL Instant 
Messenger. Google Chat, Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger 
work similarly, and have similar features. Skype, a voice-over-Internet pro­
gram described in “Internet Phones and Voice Chat,” later in this chapter, 
also includes IM chat.
AOL Instant Messenger (AIM, for short) is one of the simplest chat systems 
around. All it does is let you type messages back and forth. This chapter 
describes AIM version 7. If you use AOL, you can use either the separate AIM 
program we describe here, the AIM part of the regular AOL program, or AIM 
Express, which runs in a Web browser window. (They all do the same things 
although the windows are a little different.)
	
Instant-message programs open a new window when one of your buddies 
sends you a message. If you have a program that blocks pop-up windows in 
your browser, IM windows aren’t affected because popup-blockers block only 
Web browser pop-ups.
Taking AIM
If you’re an AOL user, you’re already set up for instant messages. If not, you 
have to install the AIM program. AOL subscribers can also run the AIM pro­
gram and use their AOL screen names when they’re logged in to another kind 
of Internet account.
AOL, hyperaggressive marketing organization that it is, has arranged for 
AIM to be bundled with a lot of other packages. If you don’t have it, visit 
www.aim.com and follow the directions on the Web page to download it. 
(See Chapter 12 to find out how to download and install programs from the 
Internet.) We recommend choosing the custom installation, which enables 
you to decline the various parasitical programs that arrive with AIM.
When you install the program, you have to choose a screen name — which 
can be as long as 16 letters (be creative so that yours doesn’t collide with 
one of the 40 million names already in use) — and a password. You also 
have to enter your e-mail address. AOL, refreshingly, doesn’t want any more 
personal information. The e-mail address you give has to be real; AOL sends 
a confirmation message to that address, and you must reply or else your 
screen name is deleted. Normally, AIM runs in the background whenever 
you’re online. If it’s not running, click the AIM icon on your desktop.

265
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
The first time you use AIM, you enter your AIM or AOL screen name, as shown 
in the left part of Figure 16-1. Type your screen name and password and click 
Sign On. If you want to use AIM every time you’re online, select the Remember 
My Password and Automatically Sign Me In boxes before signing on. After you 
sign in, you see the AIM window, shown on the right side of Figure 16-1.
	
Figure 16-1: 
Signing on 
to AIM and 
the AIM 
window.
	
Getting your buddies organized
First you create your Buddy List, and then you can send messages.
When AIM opens, you see your Buddy List; that is, other AIM users you like 
to chat with. The window shows which of your many buddies is online now 
(everyone who’s not listed in the Offline category). What? None of your pals 
appears? You should add your friends’ AOL or AIM screen names to your 
Buddy List.
In the AIM window, choose Menu➪Add to Buddy List➪Add Buddy or press 
Ctrl+D to display the New Buddy window. (The Menu button is in the upper 
right corner of the window.) Enter an AIM username, a nickname to use for 
your friend or coworker, and (optionally) a cellphone number (preceded by 
+1 for U.S. numbers) and e-mail address. (AIM can send IMs as text messages 
to cellphones.) Click the Buddy Group button to choose which group to put 
your new buddy in. AOL provides a few groups, but you can also make your 
own, by choosing Menu➪Add to Buddy List➪ Add Group. Click Save to add 
your friend as a buddy.

266
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
You can drag a buddy from one group to another in the Buddy List or get rid 
of a buddy (by clicking the buddy and then pressing Del).
Getting buddy-buddy online
To send a message to someone, double-click the buddy’s name to open a 
message window, type the message, and click the Send button or press Enter. 
AIM pops up a window (shown in Figure 16-2) on the recipient’s machine and 
plays a little song, and you and your buddy can type back and forth. When 
you’re done, close the message window.
Which instant-message system should I use?
Unfortunately, most instant-message systems 
don’t talk to one another. Because the goal of 
all these systems is to help you stay in touch 
with your friends, use whichever one they use. 
If you’re not sure who your friends are, AOL 
Instant Messenger is a good bet because it’s 
easy to set up and works automatically with 
any AOL user; it’s the same system that AOL 
uses internally. AIM, Google Chat, Windows 
Live Messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger have 
similar features because when one adds some­
thing, the others tend to follow suit. All are free; 
support text, voice, and video; and allow more 
than two people to chat. (We’ve held meet­
ings on Yahoo! Messenger with six people on 
voice and two on video and everyone typing 
snide comments at the same time.) Windows 
Live Messenger is preinstalled on Windows 
XP and easy to install on Windows Vista and 
Windows 7.
The bottom line: Use whichever system your 
friends use. If you’re message-mad or you have 
friends on more than one system, you can run 
more than one messaging program at the same 
time. While we were writing this chapter, we 
had AOL Instant Messenger, Windows Live 
Messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger all running 
at the same time. It was an awful lot of blinking 
and flashing, but it worked.
Better yet, use a program that speaks all three 
IM languages. We know of and like two, both 
free. They are Pidgin, at www.pidgin.im, 
and Trillian, at www.trillian.im, and they 
simultaneously handle every IM system you 
ever heard of. Trillian requires that you set up 
an account with it (separate from the accounts 
with the IM systems you’re using) and tries to 
install a bunch of extra applications and tool­
bars when you install it; say No unless you’re 
sure you want them. A Pro version has more 
features for $25 per year. Pidgin is plain old-
fashioned freeware — no ads, no registration, 
no begging. Adium from www.adiumx.com 
is the Mac version of Pidgin.

using AIM.
	
Making noise and pictures with AIM
After you establish a conversation using AIM, you can switch to voice or 
video (assuming that both parties have computers equipped with micro­
phones and speakers and, for video, a camera). Click the little camera icon 
and pick Audio or Video. Your friend sees a window asking whether he 
wants to make a direct connection with you. If your friend accepts the invi­
tation, you can chat using the microphone and speakers on your PC. Click 
Disconnect when you’re done talking. See the section “Adding Voices and 
Faces,” later in this chapter, for more about both voice and video on AIM.
Buzz off
AOL evidently has a lot of ill-mannered users, because AIM has a system for 
warning and blocking users you don’t like. If someone sends you an annoy­
ing message, you can choose Menu➪Block or Menu➪Report This User in the 
chat window.
What if someone IMs you when you aren’t online? You can tell AIM to show 
you your missed messages by pressing F7 or choosing Menu➪Settings in 
the AIM window, which displays the Setting – Buddy List window. Click the 
Offline IM tab, select the settings you want, and click Save. AIM can save as 
many as 40 offline messages for as long as two weeks.
You can fine-tune whom you let send messages to you: Choose Edit➪Settings 
and then click the Privacy tab. You can limit messages to people on your 
Buddy List, permit access to specific people, or block specific people. You 
can also add or delete people from your Block List. We recommend choos­
ing Only Buddies on My Buddy List unless you like being contacted by total 
strangers at inconvenient moments.

268
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
The more the merrier — 
chatting with a group
AIM doesn’t limit you to chatting with one person at a time. You can have 
several chat windows open at the same time, and have separate chats in each 
window. It can make you crazy, though, keeping track of a bunch of conversa­
tions, but teenagers do it every day.
An alternative is to have one chat window for more than just one other 
person. In a chat window, you can press Alt+C or choose Menu➪New Group 
Chat and type the screen names of people you want to invite into a group 
chat window. AIM opens a new tab in your chat window and sends invitations 
to your buddies, and, assuming that they click Accept, you’re all in!
You can control whether your multiple chats appear in separate windows 
or as separate tabs in one window. Choose Menu➪View➪Group IMs in One 
Window to switch between separate windows and tabs in one window.
Some obvious rules of messaging conduct
Sending someone an instant message is the 
online equivalent of walking up to someone 
on the street and starting a conversation. If it’s 
someone you know, it’s one thing; if not, it’s 
usually an intrusion.
Unless you have a good reason to expect that 
the other person will welcome your message, 
don’t send instant messages to people you 
don’t know who haven’t invited you to do so. 
Don’t say anything that you wouldn’t say in an 
analogous situation on the street.
Most instant-message programs allow you 
to send and receive files. Unsolicited files 
from people you don’t know are always spam, 
viruses, or both. Most virus checkers don’t 
monitor file transfers via an IM program.
The messages you send with AIM and other 
chat programs may appear to be ephemeral, 
but anyone in the conversation can easily store 
the messages. Most IM programs have a log 
feature that saves the series of messages in a 
text file, which may be embarrassing later. In 
AIM, you control your own logging by choosing 
Edit➪Settings and clicking the IM Logging tab.
Finally, if someone tells you to give a series of 
commands or to download and install a pro­
gram, don’t do it. And never tell anyone any of 
your passwords.

269
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
AIM on your phone
You can tell AIM to forward messages to your cellphone by way of text mes­
sage. Choose Edit➪Settings, and then click the Mobile tab. Click Register a 
Phone Number to display the sign-up page in your Web browser. AIM sends 
a text message to your phone with a code that you must type on the registra­
tion page, to prove that the phone is truly yours.
Or, use Windows Live Messenger
Someone at Microsoft noticed that instant messaging was a niche in which 
the company didn’t have the dominant program, and so they decided to issue 
everyone a copy of theirs. Windows XP comes with Windows Messenger 
(which used to be named MSN Messenger), whereas Windows Vista and 
Windows 7 have Windows Live Messenger Download command on the Start 
menu, which installs Messenger as part of the Windows Live package.
We don’t see the advantage of Windows Live Messenger over the other 
instant-message programs, but one nice thing is that it interconnects with 
Yahoo! Messenger, so you can chat with people who use either system. (Or, 
you can use Adium, Pidgin, or Trillian to talk with people on all the major sys­
tems. See the earlier sidebar “Which instant-message system should I use?”) 
It supports voice and video, along with sending text messages to cellphones. 
Windows Live Messenger also has a nice Sharing Folder feature that allows 
you and a friend to share photos and other files.
Versions are available for Windows and Macs. If your friends use Windows or 
Yahoo! Messenger, you can download it from get.live.com/messenger. 
See Chapter 12 to find out how to download and install programs. We recom­
mend that you decline all other programs that come along with Windows Live 
Messenger, by deselecting their check boxes during installation.
After Windows Live Messenger is installed, you can run it by choosing 
Start➪Windows Live➪Windows Live Messenger. You sign in with your free 
Windows Live ID (previously known as a .NET Passport), if you created one; 
this account is the same one you use to read Hotmail, a type of webmail 
account described in Chapter 13. The program, shown on the left side of 
Figure 16-3, works similarly to AIM, with a buddy list (contact list) and chat 
windows. You add people to your contact list by specifying their Windows 
Live e-mail address at Live.com or Hotmail.com or their Yahoo! e-mail 
address at Yahoo.com. Then right-click a contact name and choose how to 
contact them — IM, e-mail, voice call, or video call (if you have a Webcam). 
You can also make phone calls from your computer, but the calls aren’t free.

Or, use Yahoo! Messenger
Yahoo!, the popular Web site, has its own instant-message program, named 
Yahoo! Messenger. It pioneered multiperson voice and video chats back in 
2001. We’ve held six-person voice-and-video conference calls using Yahoo! 
Messenger for a total cost of $0. Yahoo Messenger can communicate with 
Windows Live Messenger, so there’s no reason to install both programs, and 
it also has a photo-sharing feature. Yahoo! Messenger can make and receive 
voice calls to real telephones, although it costs money. You can also use 
Yahoo! Messenger to join Yahoo! chat rooms, described in the section “Look 
Who’s Chatting,” later in this chapter.
To get the program, go to messenger.yahoo.com and follow the directions 
to download and install the program. If you don’t already have a Yahoo! 
account, which is also used for Yahoo! Mail and other Yahoo! services, you 
have to create one before you can log in.

271
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
Yahoo! Messenger, shown on the right side of Figure 16-3, looks and acts 
much like AIM. Choose Contact➪Add a Contact to add your friends who use 
Yahoo! or Windows Messenger. Then you can right-click a contact and choose 
how you want to communicate with them — chat, send a text message to their 
cellphone, leave a voice message, call their telephone number — you name it. 
After you’re chatting, you can click the Conference button to add other people 
or choose Actions➪View Webcam to view each other’s Webcams.
And there’s Google Chat
Every Google Gmail account includes Web-based chat that can also connect 
to AIM users. Visit www.gmail.com and log in to your Gmail account, and 
on the left side is a list of other Gmail users in your address book. (If you just 
see the word Chat or your own name, click it to expand the list.) The ones 
with colored dots are online, so click one to open a little chat window and 
start typing. If you have an AIM account, you can click Options at the bottom 
of the chat user list and sign into AIM. Google has an optional voice and video 
add-on for Windows and the Mac. Choose Options➪Voice and Video to open 
a page where you can download the voice and video plug-in. After you’ve 
done that, a little camera marks people who can do multimedia chat.
Google Chat uses an open standard known as Jabber or XMPP, so you can 
chat with anyone who has an account on any Jabber system. Google doesn’t 
offer a separate chat program (it doubtless thinks that its Chrome Web 
browser, in which you can display the Gmail window, is plenty good) but you 
can use any Jabber/XMPP client, including Adium, Pidgin, or Trillian.
Instant messaging away from home
Most IM systems let you send and receive mes­
sages from a Web browser, which is handy if 
you’re at the library or a café that has public 
computers. The Web version usually doesn’t 
have all the goodies of the downloadable 
programs, but it’s fine to exchange a few text 
messages.
For AIM, visit www.aim.com and click 
the AIM Express button. For Windows Live 
Messenger, log in to www.hotmail.com 
and click the Messenger button near the upper 
right corner to open a menu that lets you sign in 
and view your contacts. For Yahoo! Messenger, 
it’s webmessenger.yahoo.com, or 
there’s a Messenger module you can add to 
my.yahoo.com. Google and Facebook chat 
are Web based.

272
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Facebook has chat, too
	
	 Facebook (the social networking site described in Chapter 18) has chat built 
into its Web site, so you can chat with any Facebook user who’s online. 
Because Facebook users often are online just about constantly to fiddle with 
their pages and keep track of their friends, the chances of finding someone 
online for a chat are pretty good. In the lower right corner of every Facebook 
Web page is a little chat icon showing the number of your friends who are 
online. Click it to see a list of potential chat-ees, pick a friend, and start 
typing. If someone chats with you, your Facebook page pops up a little chat 
window. Like Google, Facebook doesn’t offer a separate chat program, but 
Pidgin (with an optional add-in) or Trillian will do.
Skype does chat as well as phone calls
Although Skype is best known for voice chatting (see the sidebar “The 
hype about Skype”), it also has an easy-to-use chat feature. Open the Skype 
window and click any of your online contacts, and you can type messages 
in a chat subwindow in the lower right area. During Skype phone calls, you 
can conveniently type information into the chat box or cut and paste Web 
addresses that you want your friends or associates to look at.
Abbreviations and smileys
Typing is way slower than talking, so when people IM (or participate in online 
chat, described later in this chapter), they tend to abbreviate wildly. Many 
chat abbreviations are the same as those used in e-mail. Because IM is live, 
however, some are unique. We also list some common emoticons (sometimes 
called smileys) — funky combinations of punctuation used to depict the emo­
tional inflection of the sender. If at first you don’t see what they are, try tilting 
your head to the left. Table 16-1 shows you a short list of chat abbreviations 
and emoticons.

Adding Voices and Faces
If you don’t want to talk with or see people while you chat — that is, if you 
don’t mind being limited to typing back and forth with your friends — skip 
this section. If you do want the audiovisual goodies, read on. You can use a 
Webcam with AIM, Google Chat, Skype, Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo! 
Messenger.
Say what? Hooking up the sound
Almost every computer comes with speakers, which are connected to a sound 
board inside the computer. These speakers produce the various noises that 
your programs make (such as the AOL “You’ve got mail!” announcement). 
Most laptops have built-in microphones, and most desktop computers also 
have jacks for microphones, or a microphone built right into the monitor. 
(Check your computer manual or ask almost any teenager for help with this.)
	
If you don’t have a microphone, you can get one that works with almost any 
computer. A mike should cost less than $20 at your local computer or office 
supply store. While you’re there, also check the prices on computer headsets 
that have both headphones and a mike, because both you and the people you 
are talking to will sound much better over a headset than on the computer’s 
built-in speakers.
To test your mike and speakers on a Windows machine, run the Sound 
Recorder program; try recording yourself and playing it back:
	
1.	Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Entertainment➪Sound 
Recorder or Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Sound Recorder
	
2.	Click the red Record button to start recording, and the square Stop 
button to stop.
	
	 Talk or sing or make other noises between your Start and Stop clicks.
	
3.	Click the triangular Play button to hear what you just recorded.
	
	 Click Record again to add to the end of your recording. Choose 
File➪New to start over and throw away the sound you recorded.
	
4.	Choose File➪Save to save it as a WAV (audio) file.
	
	 We like to make WAV recordings of our kids saying silly things and then 
e-mail them (the recordings, not the kids) to their grandparents.
You can adjust the volume of your microphone (for the sound coming into 
the computer) and your speakers or headphones (for the sound coming 
out) by choosing Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Entertainment➪Volume 
Control or clicking the Volume Control icon on the right side of the Windows 

275
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
taskbar. If a volume control for your microphone doesn’t appear, choose 
Options➪Properties, select the Microsoft check box so that a check mark 
appears, and click OK.
If you want to test how voices from the Net sound on your computer, type 
the URL net.gurus.org/ngc.wav into your browser and see what hap­
pens. You may need to click an Open or Open with Default Application button 
after the sound downloads.
If you can record yourself and hear the recording when you play it back, 
you’re ready for Internet-based phone calls or chats!
	
Many Webcam-related sites are, um, not, shall we say, family friendly. If you 
want to test your Webcam with a total stranger, don’t be surprised to see 
parts of the stranger that you weren’t expecting to see.
I see you!
If you want other people to be able to see you during online conversations, 
consider getting a Webcam. This small digital video camera can connect to a 
computer. Some laptops, such as the MacBook, have built-in Webcams above 
their screens; otherwise, you have to buy one. Webcams come in many sizes 
and shapes, and prices run from $30 to $300. More expensive Webcams send 
higher-quality images at higher speeds and come with better software. On the 
other hand, we’ve had great luck with a $36 Webcam for chatting with friends 
and participating in videoconferences.
Most Webcams connect to your computer’s USB port, a little rectangular plug 
on the back of the computer. Some cameras connect to special video-capture 
cards, which you have to open your computer to install.
	
If you own a digital video camera for taking video of your family and friends, 
you may be able to connect it to your computer for use as a Webcam. Check 
the manual that came with the camera.
Viewing your chat buddies
When chatting in AIM with one other person, if both you and your friend have 
Webcams set up, you can switch them on for use in your chat. Make sure that 
AIM knows about your Webcam; choose Edit➪Settings, click the Enhanced 
IM tab, and see whether the camera appears in the Video setting. (It may just 
say Default Device.)

276
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
To switch on your Webcams, click the Video button at the bottom of the chat 
window. You see a message while AIM sets up the connection, and then your 
buddy’s image appears! You can choose Actions in the video window to con­
trol the size of the video image.
Getting Webcams working with Google Chat, Skype (described in the next 
section), Windows Live Messenger, or Yahoo! Messenger works much the 
same way as with AIM.
Internet Phones and Voice Chat
For about a decade, Internet phones were just around the corner. If you have 
a broadband Net connection, you’re now rounding that corner. No Internet 
phenomenon would be complete without an arcane abbreviation, so this one 
is VoIP, for Voice over Internet Protocol, pronounced either “V-O-I-P” or to 
sound like a dripping faucet.
Some kinds of VoIP use a microphone and headphones plugged into the com­
puter, but you can also plug a regular phone into a terminal adapter, or TA.
Easy VoIP with Skype
The freeware VoIP service Skype is owned by eBay and located in 
Luxembourg, a tiny country in Europe whose main attraction is that it’s not 
anywhere else. You download and install Skype on your computer from www.
skype.com, set up a free account, and start using it to talk to other Skype 
users. You can use your computer’s built-in speakers and microphone, a 
headset with headphones and a microphone, or a handset (which is like a 
phone handset) plugged into your computer. Skype voice quality over most 
broadband is very good, much better than that of a normal phone. You can 
also buy Skype phones that work like regular cordless phones, except that 
calls are made by using Skype.
Skype isn’t limited to talking to other Skype users. You can set up a SkypeOut 
account to which you add money — from a credit card or as a bonus included 
with certain computer headsets — and you can then call any normal phone 
in the world and pay by the minute. Rates are quite low, about 2 cents per 
minute for the United States, Canada, and Europe, and do not depend on 
where you’re using Skype — only where you’re calling. John once called home 
using his laptop by way of a Wi-Fi connection in a hotel lobby in Argentina for 
2 cents rather than the dollar a minute it would have cost from a pay phone. 
You can also use SkypeIn — a real phone number for your Skype phone so 
that people can call you — for a monthly fee.

 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
Skype lets you have conference calls of as many as five people and any com­
bination of Skype users and SkypeOut calls to regular phones. It includes an 
IM feature for typing with your friends while talking to them (or even when 
you’re not talking to them). And, it has a chat feature with SkypeMe, in which 
you set up a profile, set your online status to SkypeMe, and invite people to 
call. Skype users live all over the world, so with luck you may make some new 
faraway friends.
Using a regular phone for VoIP
If you want to use a regular phone for VoIP, setting up VoIP phone service 
is moderately complicated, not unlike setting up regular phone service. You 
visit a VoIP provider’s Web site and go through the signup process, which 
includes giving your payment info and picking your phone number, which 
can be either where you live or anywhere you want people to be able to call 
you as a local call. Most VoIP companies can also port your existing phone 
number away from your old phone company so that you don’t have to 
change your number. (If you later hate your VoIP company, you can port it 
back, or to a different VoIP company.) The company then ships you the TA, 
which you plug into your Internet connection. Then you plug a regular phone 
into the TA, and you’re ready to go.
Several VoIP companies sell combined routers (see Chapter 4) and VoIP 
terminal adapters through electronics stores. In that case, you set up your 
Internet connection with the router. Then you use your computer’s Web 
browser to go to the VoIP company’s Web site to activate the terminal-
adapter part of the router, plug a phone into the phone jack on the router, 
and you’re ready to go.
VoIP companies vary a lot, with local calling areas ranging from a single U.S. 
state to all of North America and Europe and large parts of Asia. Calls to 
other customers of the same VoIP company are always free, so you might 
want to use the same one your friends have. See our Web site at net.gurus.
org/phone for some suggestions about VoIP companies.
If you have a cable modem, your cable company may also offer VoIP. If it 
does. the quality of service is better than what you get with independent 
VoIP providers, so it’s worth a close look.
The nice thing about using a regular phone for VoIP is — it’s a phone. When 
it rings, answer it. If you want to call someone, pick up the phone and dial. 
Most VoIP companies offer a full suite of phone features, such as voice mail, 
call forwarding, and caller ID, usually controlled from a Web page rather than 
from the phone itself.

Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Around the Virtual Town Pump
Typing or talking to a few people is fun and interesting, but for really good 
gossip, you need a group. Fortunately, the Internet offers limitless opportuni­
ties to find like-minded people and discuss anything you can imagine. Clubs, 
churches, and other groups use the Internet to hold meetings. Hobbyists 
and fans talk about an amazing variety of topics, from knitting to American 
Idol and everything in between. People with medical problems support each 
other and exchange tips. You get the idea — anything that people might want 
to talk about is now under intense discussion somewhere on the Net.
You can talk with groups of people on the Internet in lots of ways, including 
these:
	
✓	E-mail mailing lists, in which you exchange messages by e-mail.
	
✓	Social networking sites, such as MySpace and Facebook, described in 
Chapter 18.
	
✓	Usenet newsgroups (the original Internet discussion groups), which 
you read with a newsreading program. For a description of Usenet news­
groups and how to read them, see our Web site at net.gurus.org/
usenet. Or, go to groups.google.com on the Web and search for 
topics that interest you.
	
✓	Web-based message boards, where messages appear on a Web page.
This section tells you how to participate in Internet-based discussions using 
e-mail mailing lists and Web message boards. These systems are instant, like 
instant messaging; you post a message, and hours or days later, you get a reply.
Mailing lists: Are you sure 
that this isn’t junk mail?
An e-mail mailing list is quite different from a snail-mail mailing list. Yes, 
both distribute messages to the people on the list, but the messages on most 
e-mail mailing lists contain a discussion among the subscribers rather than 
junk mail and catalogs.
Here’s how an e-mail mailing list works. The list has its own, special e-mail 
address, and anything someone sends to that address is sent to all the 
people on the list. Because these people in turn often respond to the mes­
sages, the result is a running conversation. For example, if the authors of 
this book hosted the chocolate-lovers discussion about the use and abuse of 

279
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
chocolate, and if the list-server program ran at lists.gurus.org, the list of 
the address would be chocolate-lovers@lists.gurus.org. (We run a 
bunch of lists, but not one about chocolate. Yet.)
Different lists have different styles. Some are relatively formal, hewing closely 
to the official topic of the list. Others tend to go flying off into outer space, 
topic-wise. You have to read them for a while to be able to tell which list 
works which way.
Mailing lists fall into three categories:
	
✓	Discussion: Every subscriber can post a message. These lists lead to 
freewheeling discussions and can include a certain number of off-topic 
messages.
	
✓	Moderated: A moderator reviews each message before it’s distributed. 
The moderator can stop irrelevant, redundant, or clueless postings from 
wasting everyone’s time.
	
✓	Announcement-only: Only the moderator posts messages. 
Announcement mailing lists are essentially online newsletters.
Who handles all this mail?
Something or somebody has to take on the job of keeping track of who’s on 
the mailing list and distributing messages to all the subscribers. This job is 
way too boring for a human being to handle, so programs usually do the job. 
(A few lists are still run by human beings, and we pity them!) Most lists are 
run by list servers or mailing-list managers. Popular list manager programs 
include LISTSERV, Lyris, MailMan, Majordomo, and many others, as well as 
Web-based systems, such as Yahoo! Groups and Google Groups.
Talking to the human being in charge
Someone is in charge of every mailing list: the list manager. The list manager 
is in charge of helping people on and off the list, answering questions about 
the list, and hosting the discussion. If you have a problem with a list, write a 
nice message to the list manager. Remember that most list managers are vol­
unteers who sometimes eat, sleep, and work regular jobs as well as maintain 
mailing lists. If it takes longer than you want, be patient. Don’t send cranky 
follow-ups — they just cheese off the list manager.
The list manager’s address is usually the same as the list address with the 
addition of owner- at the beginning or -request­ just before the @. For example, 
the manager of the chocoloate-lovers@lists.gurus.org list would be 
chocoloate-lovers-request@lists.gurus.org.

Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Getting on and off lists
To find out how to subscribe to a list, or how to unsubscribe to the list, take 
a look at the instructions that (with luck) came with whatever information 
you received about the mailing list. With most lists, you can subscribe, unsub­
scribe, and change your subscription settings from the Web — you go to a Web 
page and fill out a form. Generally, you enter your e-mail address in a box on 
a Web page and click a Send or Subscribe button, and you’re on the list. This 
strategy is often more convenient than sending a command by e-mail.
	
Before you subscribe, be sure that you see a way to get off the list (an option 
that some marketing-oriented outfits neglect to provide).
You should receive a chatty, machine-generated welcoming message telling you 
that you have joined the list, along with a description of some commands you 
can use to fiddle with your mailing-list membership. Usually, this message 
includes a request to confirm that you received this message and that it was 
really you who wanted to subscribe. Follow the instructions by clicking a link 
or replying to this message, or doing whatever else the instructions say to do. 
Confirmation helps lists ensure that they aren’t mailing into the void, and keeps 
people from sticking you on lists without your knowledge. If you don’t provide 
this confirmation, you don’t get on the list.
	
Save the chatty, informative welcome message that tells you about all the 
commands you can use when you’re dealing with the list. For one thing, it tells 
you how to get off the mailing list if it’s not to your liking. We have in our mail 
program a folder named Mailing Lists, in which we store the welcome mes­
sages from all the mailing lists we join, so that we don’t have to embarrass 
ourselves by asking for help with unsubscribing later.
Urrp! Computers digest messages!
Some mailing lists are digested. No, they’re not 
dripping with digital gastric juices — they’re 
digested more in the sense of Reader’s Digest. 
All the messages over a particular period (usu­
ally a day or two) are gathered into one big 
message with a table of contents added at the 
front. Many people find this method more con­
venient than receiving messages separately, 
because you can easily look at all messages on 
the topic at one time.
We prefer to receive our messages individually, 
and to tell our e-mail program to sort our incom­
ing messages into separate folders, one for 
each mailing list we subscribe to. Thunderbird, 
Windows Live Mail, and many other e-mail pro­
grams can sort your messages.

281
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
To get off a list, you again visit the Web page for the list and follow the unsub­
scription instructions. Don’t send a message to the list saying “Please unsub­
scribe me” because it just wastes the other subscribers’ time.
Stupid mailing-list tricks
Most list servers know some other commands, including commands to hold 
your mail for a while, send you a daily message that includes all postings for 
the day, and see a subscriber list. For the exact commands, which vary depend­
ing on the list server software, refer to the instructions you received when you 
subscribed to the list. (You did save the welcome message, didn’t you?)
Sending messages to mailing lists
Okay, you’re signed up on a mailing list. Now what? First, wait a week or so 
to see what sort of messages arrive from the list — that way, you can get an 
idea of what you should or should not send to it. When you think that you 
have seen enough to avoid embarrassing yourself, try sending something in. 
That’s easy: You mail a message to the list address, which is the same as the 
name of the list — chocolate-lovers@lists.gurus.org or dandruff-
l@bluesuede.org or whatever. Keep in mind that because hundreds or 
thousands of people may be reading your pearls of wisdom, don’t send any­
thing until you have something to say, and try to spell things correctly. (You 
might think that this advice is obvious, but you would be sadly mistaken.) On 
popular lists, you may begin to get back responses within a few minutes of 
sending a message.
Boing!
Computer accounts are created and deleted 
often enough and mail addresses change often 
enough that a large list always contains, at 
any given moment, some addresses that are 
no longer valid. If you send a message to the 
list, your message is forwarded to these invalid 
addresses — and a return message (report­
ing a bad address) is generated for each of 
them. Mailing-list managers (both human and 
computer) normally try to deflect the error 
messages over to the list owner, who can do 
something about them, rather than to you. As 
often as not, however, a persistently dumb mail 
system sends one of these failure messages 
directly to you. Just ignore it because you can’t 
do anything about it.
Sometimes you may see an “I’m away on vaca­
tion” message or a “Click here if you’re not a 
spammer” message in response to list messages 
you send. Don’t respond to those, either — 
vacation and antispam programs shouldn’t 
even be responding to list mail. Forward those 
messages to the list manager, though, so that 
she can suspend those recipients’ subscrip­
tions until they get their software under control.

282
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Some mailing lists have rules about who is allowed to send messages, so just 
because you’re on the list doesn’t automatically mean that any messages 
you send appear on the list. Some lists are moderated: Any message you 
send in is sent to a human moderator who decides what goes to the list and 
what doesn’t. Although this process may sound sort of fascist, moderation 
can make a list about 50 times more interesting than it would be otherwise 
because a good moderator can filter out the boring and irrelevant messages 
and keep the list on track. Indeed, the people who complain the loudest 
about moderator censorship are usually the ones whose messages most 
urgently need to be filtered out.
Another rule that sometimes causes trouble is that many lists allow messages 
to be sent only from people whose addresses appear on the list, to prevent 
the list from being overrun with spam. If your mailing address changes, you 
have to resubscribe or else you can’t post anything.
The fine points of replying to list messages
Often, you receive an interesting message from a list and want to respond 
to it. When you send your answer, does it go just to the person who sent the 
original message or to the entire list? It depends on how the list manager set 
up the list. About half the list managers set up their lists so that replies go 
automatically to just the person who sent the original message, on the theory 
that your response is likely to be of interest to only the original author. The 
other half set up the lists so that replies go to the entire list, on the theory 
that the list is a running public discussion. In messages coming from the list, 
the mailing-list software automatically sets the Reply-To header line to the 
address to which replies should be sent. (Which way to set it up is a topic 
that can provoke great and prolix passion, so don’t ever suggest that they 
change it.)
Fortunately, you’re in charge of that feature. When you start to create a reply, 
your mail program should show you the address to which it’s replying. If you 
don’t like the address it’s using, change the address. Check the To and Cc 
fields to make sure that you’re sending your message where you want. Don’t 
run the risk of sending a message such as, “I agree with you — aren’t the rest 
of these people idiots?” to the whole list if you intend it for only one person.
While you’re fixing the recipient’s address, you may also want to fix the 
Subject line. After a few rounds of replies to replies to replies, the topic of 
discussion often wanders away from the original topic. Change the subject to 
better describe what is really under discussion, as a favor to the other folks 
trying to follow the discussion.

283
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
How to avoid looking like a dimwit
	
After you subscribe to a list, don’t send anything to it until you read it for a 
week. Trust us — the list has been getting along without your insights since it 
began, and it can get along without them for one more week.
You can determine which topics people really discuss and the tone of the list, 
for example. It also gives you a fair idea about which topics people are tired 
of. The classic newcomer gaffe is to subscribe to a list and immediately send 
a message asking a dumb question that isn’t germane to the topic and that 
was beaten to death three days earlier.
The number-two newcomer gaffe is to send a message directly to the list 
asking to subscribe or unsubscribe. This type of message should go to the 
list manager or list server program, not to the list itself, where all the other 
subscribers can see that you screwed up.
	
One more thing not to do: If you don’t like what another person is posting (for 
example, some newbie is posting blank messages or “unsubscribe me” mes­
sages or is ranting interminably about a topic), don’t waste everyone’s time by 
posting a response on the list. The only thing stupider than a stupid posting is 
a response complaining about it. Instead, e-mail the person privately and ask 
him to stop, or e-mail the list manager and ask that person to intervene.
Posting to message boards
Mailing lists are great if you want to receive messages by e-mail, but some 
people prefer to read messages on the Web. These folks are in luck: Message 
boards are Web-based discussion groups that post messages on a Web site. 
They’re also called discussion boards, forums, or communities. Like mailing 
lists, some message boards are readable only by subscribers, some allow 
only subscribers to post, and some are moderated (that is, a moderator must 
approve messages before they appear on the message board). Other mes­
sage boards are more like bulletin boards: Anyone can post at any time, and 
there’s no continuity to the messages or feeling of community among the 
people who post.
Many Web sites include message boards. Some Web sites are dedicated to 
hosting message boards on lots of different topics. Some sites host message 
boards that can also send the messages to you by e-mail, so they work as 
message boards and mailing lists rolled into one.

284
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
Web-based discussion sites
Here are some of our favorites:
	
✓	About.com, at www.about.com: About.com hires semipro experts in 
a wide variety of fields to host sites about each field. For example, the 
knitting site at knitting.about.com is run by a world-class knitter 
who posts articles and patterns and hosts one or more message boards 
about knitting. Find the Forums or My Forums link to join in. Figure 16-4 
shows a discussion of knitting techniques.
	
✓	Google Groups, at groups.google.com: Google Groups started as a 
way for people to participate in Usenet newsgroups over the Web. Then 
Google provided a way to set up new groups, too. You can search by 
topic for groups or messages of interest.
	
Figure 16-4: 
About.
com hosts 
sites about 
hundreds 
(thou-
sands?) of 
topics, each 
with a mes-
sage board.
	
	
✓	Yahoo! Groups, at groups.yahoo.com: Yahoo! Groups includes mes­
sage boards and file libraries, and you can read the messages either 
on the Web site or by e-mail — it’s your choice when you join a group. 
Yahoo! Groups also features calendars for group events and real-time 
chats right on the Web site. To join, you must first sign up for a free 
Yahoo! ID, which also gets you a mailbox and free Web space — what 
a deal! You can also create your own Yahoo! group by clicking links — 
either a public group for all to join or a private group for your club or 
family.

285
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
Subscribing and participating
Most good message boards require you to register before you can subscribe, 
which means that you choose a username and password, and possibly pro­
vide your e-mail address, and respond to a message sent to that address. 
Registration makes it harder for spam-posting robots to take over the mes­
sage board.
To subscribe to a community on one of these Web sites, just follow the 
instructions on the site. Some community Web sites let you read the mes­
sages posted to their lists without subscribing — you can click links to dis­
play the messages in your Web browser.
You can set up your own mailing lists or message boards, too. It’s free 
because the sites display ads on their Web pages, and may even tack on ads 
to the postings on the list. If you have an unusual hobby, job, interest, or 
ailment, you may want to create a list to discuss it. Or, set up a list for a com­
mittee or family group to use for online discussions.
Look Who’s Chatting
If mailing lists and message boards are too slow — if you want to chat with 
strangers right now — you might want to try online chat, which is similar to 
CB radio. Online chat differs from IM chat because it’s public and you usually 
don’t know the other people in the discussion.
You begin chatting by entering an area of the Internet called an electronic 
chat room (AOL calls them channels). After you join a room, you can read 
onscreen what people are saying and then add your own comments just 
by typing them and clicking Send. Although several people participating in 
the chat can type at the same time, each person’s contribution is presented 
Finding interesting online communities
Tens of thousands of communities — in the 
form of mailing lists, message boards, and 
hybrids of the two — reside on the Internet, 
but there’s no central directory of them. This is 
partly because so many lists are intended only 
for specific groups of people, like members of 
the board of directors of the First Parish Church 
of Podunk or students in Economics 101 at Tech 
State.
You can find some communities by searching 
the Web (as we describe in Chapter 8) and 
including the word or phrase, mailing list, com­
munity, forum, or message board. Or, start at 
www.about.com, groups.google.com, 
or groups.yahoo.com and search for your 
topic.

286
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
onscreen in the order received. Whatever people type appears in the general 
conversation window and is identified by their screen names. On some chat 
systems, such as AOL, each participant can select a personal type font and 
color for his comments.
If one of the people in a chat room seems like someone you want to know 
better, you can ask to establish a private room or direct connection, which is a 
private conversation between you and the other person and not much differ­
ent from instant messaging. And, of course, you might get such an invitation 
from someone else. It’s not uncommon for someone to be in a chat room and 
be holding several direct conversations at the same time, although it’s con­
sidered rude (not to mention confusing!) to overdo this.
You might also be asked to join a private chat room with several other 
people. We’re not really sure just what goes on in those rooms because we’ve 
never been invited.
Where is everyone chatting?
Which groups of people you can chat with depends on which chat system 
you connect to. Here are a few places you can find groups of people chatting 
online:
	
✓	America Online: If you have an America Online account, you can chat 
with other AOL users. Get AOL For Dummies, by John Kaufeld and Ted 
Leonsis (Wiley), for a full description of AOL chat rooms. Or, after you 
have an AIM account, start at chat.aim.com and click See All Chats to 
see which topics are active.
	
✓	Skype and other VoIP systems: If you use Skype (described in the sec­
tion “Internet Phones and Voice Chat,” earlier in this chapter), you can 
choose the Live tab to join a public voice chat or choose Chats➪Start 
Public Chat to start your own.
	
✓	Web sites. Some Web sites include chat rooms, using a plug-in program 
that allows people to type at each other.
	
✓	Yahoo! Messenger: In Yahoo! Messenger, you can choose Messenger➪
Yahoo Chat.
Chatting is pretty much the same from system to system, although the par­
ticipants vary. This section gives a sense of the essence of chat no matter 
where you go to do it. We describe how to use Web-based chat rooms later in 
this chapter.
Each chat room has a name; with luck, the name is an indication of what the 
chatters there are talking about or what they have in common. Some chan­
nels have names such as lobby, and the people there are probably just being 
sociable.

287
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
Who am I?
No matter which chat facility you use, each participant has a screen name, or 
nickname, often chosen to be unique, colorful, or clever and used as a mask. 
Chatters sometimes change their screen names. This anonymity makes a chat 
room a place where you need to be careful. On the other hand, one attraction 
of chatting is meeting new and interesting people. Many warm and wonderful 
friendships have evolved from a chance meeting in a chat room.
When you join a group and begin chatting, you see the screen names of the 
people who are already there and a window in which the current conversa­
tion goes flying by. If the group is friendly, somebody may even send you a 
welcome message.
	
As in real life, in a room full of strangers you’re likely to encounter people you 
don’t like much. Because it’s possible to be fairly anonymous on the Internet, 
some people act boorish, vulgar, or crude. If you’re new to chat, sooner or 
later you’ll visit some disgusting places, although you’ll find out how to avoid 
them and find rooms that have useful, friendly, and supportive conversations. 
Be very careful about letting children chat unsupervised (see Chapter 3). Even 
in chat rooms that are designed for young people and provide some supervi­
sion, unwholesome goings-on can take place.
Type or talk?
The original chat rooms consisted entirely of people typing messages to each 
other. Newer chat systems include voice chat (which requires you to have a 
microphone and speakers on your computer) and even video (which requires 
a Webcam if you want other people to be able to see you).
Getting Used to Chat Culture
Your first time in a chat room can seem stupid or daunting or both. Here are 
some things you can do to survive your first encounters:
	
✓	Remember that when you enter a chat room, a conversation is probably 
already in progress. You don’t know what went on before you arrived.
	
✓	Wait a minute or two to see a page full of exchanges so that you can 
understand some of the context before you start writing.
	
✓	Read messages for a while to figure out what’s happening before sending 
a message to a chat group. (Reading without saying anything is known 
as lurking. When you finally venture to say something, you’re de-lurking.) 
Lurking isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but be aware that you might not 
always have the privacy you think you have.

288
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
	
✓	Some chat systems enable you to indicate people to ignore. Messages 
from these chatters no longer appear on your screen, although other 
members’ replies to them do appear. This strategy is usually the best 
way to deal with obnoxious chatters. You may also be able to set 
your chat program not to display the many system messages, which 
announce when people arrive or leave or are ejected forcefully from the 
chat room.
	
✓	Scroll up to see older messages if you have to, but remember that on 
most systems, after you have scrolled up, no new messages appear until 
you scroll back down.
	
Chatting etiquette isn’t much different from e-mail etiquette, and common 
sense is your best guide. Here are some additional chatting tips:
	
✓	The first rule of chatting is not to hurt anyone. A real person with real 
feelings is at the other end of the computer-chat connection. Don’t insult 
people, and don’t use foul language, and don’t respond to people who do.
	
✓	The second rule is to be cautious. You really have no idea who the other 
people are. Remember, too, that people might be people hanging out in 
a chat room and quietly collecting information, and you might not notice 
them because they never say anything. (See the “Safety first” section in 
Chapter 2.)
	
✓	Keep your messages short and to the point.
	
✓	Create a profile with selected information about yourself. Most chat sys­
tems have provisions for creating profiles (personal information) that 
other members can access.
	
	Don’t give out your last name, phone number, or address. Extra caution 
is necessary for kids: A kid should never enter her age, hometown, 
school, last name, phone number, or address. Although you don’t have 
to tell everything about yourself in your profile, what you do say should 
be truthful. The one exception is role-playing chat, where everyone is 
acting out a fantasy character.
	
✓	If you want to talk to someone in private, send a message saying hi, who 
you are, and what you want.
	
✓	If the tone of conversation in one chat room offends or bores you, try 
another. As in real life, you run into lots of people in chat rooms that 
you don’t want to meet — and you don’t have to stay there.
	
As in society at large, online chat involves some contact with strangers. 
Most encounters are with reasonable folks. For the rest, common sense 
dictates that you keep your wits about you — and your private information 
private. See Chapter 2 for some guidelines for staying safe while chatting 
with strangers.

289
 Chapter 16: Typing and Talking on the Net
Let’s Chat
Whatever chat service you use, the idea is the same: You read other people’s 
messages and chime in with your own. In this section, we describe Web-
based chat because it’s available to all Internet users without installing any 
extra programs.
Web-based chat sites have Java-based chat programs that your browser can 
download and run automatically. Some other Web chat sites require that 
you download a plug-in or an ActiveX control to add chat capability to your 
browser. (See Chapter 7 for information on how to use plug-ins.)
Finding some action
Some Web chat sites include
 
✓ ICQ Chat, at www.icq.com/icqchat
 
✓ AIM Chat, at chat.aim.com
 
✓ The new Google Wave at wave.google.com
 
✓ Userplane, at www.userplane.com, which supports text, voice, and 
video chat. Click the Directory box near the bottom of the page to find 
active chats.
Many other Web sites have chats on the specific topic of the site. Search for 
chat at www.google.com for a variety of chat venues.
Starting to chat
Most chat sites have directories or search boxes so that you can find a group 
talking about a topic of interest. We find that after you enter the chat room, 
93 percent of chats are about nothing at all, or general flirting, so you may 
need to shop around. Also, you may make a number of tries before you find 
a chat room where people are actually chatting — sometimes, everyone 
appears to have wandered off.
Most Web-based chat pages have a large window that displays the ongo-
ing conversation, a smaller window that displays the screen names of the 
participants, and a text area where you type messages. After you type your 
message, press Enter or click Send and the message appears in the message 
window for you and everyone else in the chat room.

In some chat rooms, you can click a name in the list of participants to see 
more information about that person, perhaps a name, location, or picture. 
Some chat rooms have links or buttons that enable you to turn on voice capa­
bility so that you can talk into your computer’s microphone and hear other 
people from the speakers. And, some have video buttons or links that can 
enable your Webcam.

e’re sure that you’re reading about the Internet to become a more 
useful, productive member of society and bring positive change to 
the world. Or maybe not. You wouldn’t be the only person on the planet who 
uses the Internet primarily to have fun. Enterprising game designers have 
found myriad ways to meet and exceed the time-wasting needs of the most 
demanding Internaut. Your options include traditional games, single-player 
games, multiplayer games, and Brave New Worlds you can create.
A Solitaire-y Pastime
When people say “online gaming,” we often assume that they mean multi­
player games, and for good reason: The Internet is fundamentally a com­
munication technology, and the biggest advantage to online games is the 
enormous pool of other players available at any time.
If you’re feeling antisocial, though, plenty of single-person games can be 
found, from classic solitaire to video games to games that are secretly teach­
ing you something. Here are some places to look:

Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
	
✓	Games.com: The site www.games.com (from AOL) has numerous soli­
taire games available to anyone willing to create a free account. (Read 
the sidebar “Who am us, anyway?” later in this chapter, to see how to 
create an account.)
	
✓	AddictingGames: One of countless Web sites dedicated to solitary 
gaming is www.addictinggames.com, shown in Figure 17-1. A 
good search engine can help you find others, like Miniclip (www.
miniclip.com).

✓	Game Show Network: The GSN cable-television games network has a 
Web site where you can play along with the shows, at www.gsn.com. If 
you win, your name may even appear on TV!
	
✓	Merchandising advertising: Many corporations advertise their products 
in downloadable games. If you like Legos, try play.lego.com. The Web 
sites for some action movies offer related games.
	
✓	MSN Games: Puzzle, card, word, trivia, and other types of games are 
available at the Microsoft site zone.msn.com. Yahoo! Games at games.
yahoo.com is the same idea.
	
✓	Neopets: You can play action, puzzle, and word games at www.
neopets.com to earn virtual money (not the real stuff, unfortunately) 
to buy products for your virtual pets. Neopets allows for some degree of 
interaction between players, but most activities are solo.
	
✓	VirtualNES: If you loved your old Nintendo game console, you’ll love 
www.virtualnes.com. It offers classic Nintendo Entertainment System 
games for free. (It’s legal because the games are now out of copyright.)

Plays Well with Others
Anyone who spends much time playing games on the Internet will probably 
eventually want to play with other people. Most of us simply find more thrill 
in facing off with another human being than with an electronic box.
When looking for a game to play online, don’t think that you need to sift 
through the overflowing shelves of the local video game store. An easy way 
to start is with games you already know.
A great many classic games have been adapted for online play, both propri­
etary ones, such as Scrabble and Monopoly, and ancient ones, such as chess 
and Go. Chances are good that you already know how to play at least one of 
them, so look for a free site on which to play. Here’s what to do:
	
1.	 Choose a game — one you’re comfortable with already. The field is wide 
open!
	
2.	 Consult with friends who play the game; they may recommend a Web 
site, or you may end up referring them to your choice.
	
3.	 If you have an AOL account (perhaps you use AIM), you’ll find its game 
service (at games.aol.com) mostly free and easy to use. If not, try the 
MSN game site (games.msn.com).
	
4.	 If you use Facebook (described in Chapter 18), you can play online 
games solo or with other Facebookers. Type games into the search box, 
click Applications from the list of types of search results, and choose 
from the games. Our favorite is Bananagrams.
	
5.	 Try typing online game in your favorite search engine. You can find 
many free, independent sites, like OKbridge (at www.okbridge.com) or 
Miniclip (www.miniclip.com).
Start playing in a Flash
Most games use interactive moving graphics, 
written in a system from Adobe Systems named 
Flash. To play these games, you download and 
install Flash Player, a plug-in for your browser 
that enables it to play Flash games. YouTube, 
the popular video-sharing site, uses Flash, too. 
(See Chapter 9 for more about Web-based 
video.) No matter what kind of games you play, 
you want Flash Player.
You can download Flash Player from get.
adobe.com/flashplayer. If you try to 
play a Flash-based game and you don’t have 
the player loaded yet, your browser will prob­
ably display a message and suggest installing it. 
Adobe updates Flash fairly frequently, generally 
to add whizzo features or fix security bugs, so 
if your browser suggests a Flash update, surf 
over to the Adobe Web site and install it.

Looking to become a bridge master? At certain sites, like the American 
Contract Bridge League (at www.acbl.org), you can earn master points by 
playing online.
Games You Can Play at Any Computer
Some computer games don’t involve online play — one of our kids loves 
strategy games that simulate battles from Rome to Gettysburg to WWII. 
These games traditionally come on CDs or DVDs because they include enor­
mous amounts of high-quality graphics (along with sound and video). These 
CDs are copy-protected and can be installed on only one or two computers. 
If you lose the CD or you buy a new computer, you may lose your games and 
have to repurchase them.
Who am us, anyway?
For many of the games described in this sec­
tion, you need to create an account, which is 
simply an online identification that helps the 
site owners distinguish you from your neighbor. 
Creating an account generally involves these 
steps:
	 1.	 Find the Create Account or Register link 
and click it.
	
	 It’s on the home page of the Web site. If you 
see a Sign In link, click it because it prob­
ably leads to a page with a link to register.
	 2.	 Enter your information, including a user­
name and password.
	
	 Make up a username that you can remem­
ber and that reflects the kind of character 
you want to be in the game. Choose a pass­
word that isn’t in the dictionary and isn’t the 
same as any nongame passwords.
	
	 Remember: Don’t choose the same pass­
word you use for online banking or making 
purchases! See “What’s the secret word, 
Mr. Potter?” in Chapter 2 for advice on pick­
ing passwords. We keep our passwords in 
the KeePass program (downloadable from 
www.keepass.info).
	 3.	 Check your e-mail for the activation code.
	
	 Generally, the Web site sends you an acti­
vation code that you must enter in order to 
activate your account. This system allows 
the Web site to confirm that your e-mail 
address is really yours.
	 4.	 Play!
What type of information do game Web sites 
ask for? Generally, they want your name and 
e-mail address. (If they ask for your birthdate, 
feel free to make one up. What business is it of 
theirs?) For games that cost money, you have 
to provide credit card information. Providing it 
is never entirely without risk but, as we discuss 
elsewhere in this book, not nearly as dangerous 
as you might think.

295
 Chapter 17: Games and Worlds on the Web
Steam (at steampowered.com) is a way of buying games for your computer 
without waiting for the letter carrier to deliver it in a box. You can search for 
games and purchase them for (usually) slightly less than the boxed games 
from a store. Rather than send you a CD or DVD, Steam simply downloads 
the game to your computer. Downloading can take several hours, depending 
on the computer and your Internet connection. The advantage, in addition 
to saving postage and receiving them right away, is that your games aren’t 
tied to your computer. If you’re away from home, you can get on your Steam 
account from any computer, download your games to the computer, and 
play them. (Steam allows you to play from only one computer at a time.) This 
system means that you don’t lose your games regardless of what happens to 
your computer. (Just don’t lose your password!) In addition, the system keeps 
all your games currently downloading and installing updates automatically.
Here’s the bad news: Steam is free, but the games are not. Steam runs only on 
PCs, not on Macs. And, if you want to play your games on a computer that’s 
never connected to the Internet, you’re out of luck.
MMORPGs Are More Fun 
than They Sound
MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) are one of the 
biggest online gaming industries, and something of a pop culture phenom­
enon. You may not have heard the term, but if you spend any time around 
gamers, you hear the names — RuneScape, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, and 
EverQuest among them.
What’s all the fuss about? Read on, and we’ll show you.
The general idea
MMO, or massively multiplayer online, just means that it’s a big online game 
with lots of people playing together at one time. RPG stands for role-playing 
game, which may require more explanation. In a role-playing game, you 
invent a character, a fictitious personality who represents you in a fictional 
world and whose actions you control. You play the role of a fictitious person­
ality while exploring an imaginary world.
Computer RPGs generally ask you to take on the role of a warrior or an 
adventurer, and the main activities of your alter ego are fighting and trea­
sure-hunting, although many MMORPGs also have possibilities for trading, 

296
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
crafting, nation-building, and more. These RPGs are as much about develop­
ing your character’s abilities as his or her personality; as you fight, your 
character gains levels of skill, experience points, and better equipment, with 
which you can fight more dangerous monsters and earn yet more levels and 
equipment.
One of the earliest commercially successful RPGs, the pen-and-paper game 
Dungeons & Dragons, has a fantasy setting, a tradition that many modern 
RPGs uphold. If elves and dwarves leave you cold, there are MMORPGs for 
you, with themes ranging from crime fiction to comic books to the occult. 
For a long list, go to Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org) and type List of free 
MMOGs or List of MMORPGs in the search box.
Some groups of players like to hang out in online chat rooms where they can 
discuss the action. The most popular chat space for online players seems to 
be Internet Relay Chat (IRC), which we describe at net.gurus.org/irc. 
See Chapter 16 for more about chatting with groups online.
Who’s playing?
Many people think that MMORPGs are the exclusive playground of geeky, 
straight, white, male gamers. (Of course, we know that you don’t hold that 
narrow-minded view!) Without getting into nature-versus-nurture debates, 
our experience suggests that there’s some truth to this stereotype.
	
Whether it’s a cause or an effect of their scarcity, minority gamers may some­
times feel less than welcome in the online world. You may find that other play­
ers, emboldened by anonymity and able to assume that other users are just 
like them, express offensive sentiments more freely than they might in person. 
Every game has antiharassment policies, but many games are used by so 
many players that enforcement is sometimes patchy.
Regardless, MMORPGs are not purely white men’s spaces, nor are they used 
only by stereotypical gamers. Most MMORPGs depend more on quick think­
ing than on quick reflexes, and are thus accessible to those without much 
video game experience. World of Warcraft has more than 11 million players — 
we’re sure you’ll find like-minded people to hang out with.
	
If you feel like an outsider among gamers, you should know that alternative 
gaming communities exist in which you may feel more comfortable. Rather 
than be discouraged by the occasional bigoted remark, why not seek out a 
feminist mercenary guild, Chicano raiding team, or band of gay-friendly orcs? 
Believe us, they exist!

297
 Chapter 17: Games and Worlds on the Web
Of course, there are bad apples in any online barrel, and you may run into 
trolls, players who deliberately annoy other people just for the fun of it. (The 
activity is trolling.) Your best defense is to ignore them.
Choosing a server
After you choose an MMORPG to play, create an account, and provide your 
credit card information, you may need to choose a server. Large games may 
have tens of thousands of people playing simultaneously. To avoid overload­
ing the system, players are divided over a number of servers. Each server is a 
separate computer system running a separate copy of the “world,” to prevent 
it from getting too crowded. For the most part, all servers are equally usable, 
but here are some thoughts to consider:
	
✓	Location: Servers located near you physically are less likely to lag, 
which is important if you have a slow machine. The amount of time it 
takes your command to travel halfway around the world to a distant 
server may prove annoying.
	
✓	RP: Some designated “role-play” servers require users to speak with medi­
eval affectations and eschew modern slang and game terms, forsooth.
	
✓	PvP: Some servers are all about player-versus-player combat, whereas 
others forbid it.
	
✓	Population: On a smaller server, your connection is slightly faster, but it 
may be harder to find players to trade or fight with.
	
✓	Friends: If you know someone who plays, ask which server she’s on and 
join that one.
Roaming around RuneScape
RuneScape is a popular fantasy MMORPG aimed mainly at children and teen­
agers. Its chief claim to fame is its price tag: $0. RuneScape has a simplistic 
but serviceable combat engine and many nonviolent pastimes, such as 
mining, cooking, and other handicrafts.
The advantages of RuneScape include these:
	
✓	It’s freely available online.
	
✓	It has manageable system requirements.
	
✓	It has useful guides and manuals, and may be less intimidating than more 
advanced RPGs. Its tutorial explains how to play the game and gets you 
started easily, and the information applies to other online games as well.

298
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
However, RuneScape has some disadvantages:
	
✓	If you prefer gaming with adults, the low RuneScape price attracts a 
younger population.
	
✓	Its graphics are less sophisticated than those in pricier games.
	
✓	It has less character customization than other RPGs. (All characters are 
human, for instance).
	
✓	It isn’t completely free. Some skills and areas are available to only those 
who pay for membership, which starts at $5 per month.
Want to try it out? Find it at www.runescape.com. After you make your 
account, we recommend jumping right in. The beginning of the game is a 
handy tutorial. After you play around a bit, you may want to go back and read 
the online manual, which makes more sense in context.
	
RuneScape isn’t the only free online RPG. Many others are on the Web, includ­
ing the two-dimensional AdventureQuest (www.battleon.com), the chess-
based Tactics Arena Online (www.tacticsarena.com), and the text 
adventure Kingdom of Loathing (www.kingdomofloathing.com).
Crafting war in World of Warcraft
The MMORPGs World of Warcraft (at www.worldofwarcraft.com), EverQuest 
(www.everquest.com), EverQuest II (www.everquest2.com), and Final 
Fantasy XI (playonline.com/ff11us) are examples of from mainstream 
game developers. These games have more content, more options, and snaz­
zier graphics than do free online games. They’re also significantly more 
expensive.
Your first step, if you choose to play one of these games, is to acquire the 
software. Unlike the games we describe earlier in this chapter, which you can 
play in your Web browser, these fancier games require special programs on 
your computer. For World of Warcraft, you’ll probably make a pilgrimage to 
your local game shop to buy the game.
After you install it, you (as usual) set up an account, enter your credit card 
information, and decide how to pay for the game. Most of these games 
require a monthly fee, like magazine subscriptions do. Also like magazines, 
they give you a bulk discount, and you can cancel at any time.
	
Rather than make a long-term commitment early, get a free trial of the game 
and then decide how to pay after it ends. Here are some ways to acquire a free 
trial:

299
 Chapter 17: Games and Worlds on the Web
	
✓	Referrals: Many games let current members give their friends free trial 
accounts.
	
✓	Out of the box: Often, you get a free trial when buying the game. These 
games are released and rereleased frequently, so do some comparison 
shopping and make sure that the edition you buy gives you enough time 
to evaluate.
	
✓	Demo disks: We have gotten free software and trial periods from maga­
zine promotions and the like.
	
✓	Special offers: As in any industry, good deals often exist for the persis­
tent and discerning on the game Web sites.
You can read instructions for World of Warcraft at worldofwarcraft.com/
info — click the Introduction or Getting Started links in the Game Guide 
listing. In the game, you can click the flashing exclamation point icon at the 
bottom of the screen for help, too.
After you start playing World of Warcraft, you can pick a race (elf, orc, gnome, 
or undead, for example) and a class (fighter, wizard, healer) for your charac­
ter. The races belong to one of two factions — the Alliance or the Horde — 
who are locked in never-ending combat to control the world of Azeroth. 
Choosing wisely is important — if you dislike your character, you generally 
have to start again from the beginning. However, the rule books don’t indi­
cate what you’ll enjoy, so we recommend trying a few different characters 
briefly before settling on one.
The basic activities of the game are killing monsters for levels and rare items, 
a process that can sometimes grow tedious. To liven it up and speed things 
along, consider working together with other players. Either arrange to play 
at the same time as your friends or ask around online to find others looking 
for a group. Some classes are more popular in groups than others, something 
you might consider when designing your character.
After you’ve played for a while, you may want to consider joining a guild, 
which is simply an association of like-minded players who cooperate to earn 
power, wealth, and prestige. The chief benefit is the ease with which you can 
recruit party members, but most games also offer mechanical incentives to 
join guilds. Of course, many people join more for the camaraderie and guild-
marked clothing than for any material benefit.
	
One recent game that’s quite different from those discussed here is Guild 
Wars, at www.guildwars.com; it has no monthly fees. Joining a guild should 
be your first priority because the focus of the game is guild-on-guild combat. 
The monster-hunting, treasure-finding part of the game has been abridged and 
streamlined to let you jump into player-versus-player (PvP) mode rather than 
player-versus-computer mode action that much faster.

It’s a Whole New World
Second Life (at www.secondlife.com) is a game unlike any other, if it 
can even be accurately termed a game. It’s a complex phenomenon that 
shares properties of MMORPGs and social networking sites, like Facebook 
(described in Chapter 18).
Second Life is essentially a simulated world — not our exact world, but rather 
another world with towns and people. It started with land, sea, and sky, and 
players have created towns, cities, building, parks, and businesses. (Go to 
maps.secondlife.com to see what’s there.) In Second Life, you can run a 
store, buy and sell clothes, visit night clubs, or do practically anything else 
that some daring user has programmed. Although you create a character to 
represent you, as in an RPG, you don’t fight monsters (unless that’s what you 
truly want to do) and you don’t accumulate levels. Rather, the game attempts 
to simulate the real world in its entirety — or at least an alternative reality 
populated by players who appear as 20-something hipsters and a smattering 
of dragons and talking raccoons.
Whom might you meet in Second Life? Almost anyone. The population skews 
slightly male and geekier than the average population, but it’s certainly not 
used only by gamers and programmers. You find artists, stay-at-home moms, 
and presidential candidates as well (no joke!). A few corporations own islands 
in Second Life in which they hold virtual business meetings. You can even 
attend religious services (for example, from maps.secondlife.com, search 
for unitarian to find the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Second Life).
By the way, if you want a simulation of this world, go to www.twinity.
com, which is creating online copies of real cities, starting with Berlin and 
Singapore.
A day in the Second Life
At the www.secondlife.com Web site, you can acquire the free Second Life 
software. You must be at least 18 to play; minors 13 and older should check 
out teen.secondlife.com. Either way, the first thing you want to do is 
create an account and download the software.
The basic version of Second Life is free, although if you provide your credit 
card information, you get some free Linden dollars, the currency of Second 
Life. We recommend that you do this. Providing your information now makes 
it easier for you to be tempted to spend money later, but you don’t get far in 
Second Life without a few Linden dollars.

301
 Chapter 17: Games and Worlds on the Web
When you set up your account, you choose a name for your character. Your 
name matters. You‘re offered a selection of last names from which you must 
pick (although you can see a different selection by reloading the page), and 
your first-name-last-name combination must be unique. You cannot change 
your name after you have created the account. Most people opt for names 
with standard capitalization and no numbers, but your mileage may vary. 
Some people choose names based on their real names, and some go for cre­
ative names, puns, or homages to favorite fictional characters. (Thanks to 
Second Lifer Kenneth Sutton for this advice.)
You start off on Tutorial Island, shown in Figure 17-2. You learn how to create 
and dress your avatar, which is the Second Life version of you. The screen 
prompts walk you through changing the appearance of your avatar, walking, 
flying, picking up items, and looking around. At that point, you can head off 
to the mainland.
	
Figure 17-2: 
Watching 
Second Life 
go by.
	
Absolutely the first thing you should do is change your clothes. Tutorial 
Island gives you three stylish outfits to choose from; don’t wear them. Seize 
the chance for a little self-expression and design something that doesn’t mark 
you as so obviously new. Fashion snobbery is alive and well on the Internet, 
but you generally get an A for effort. As long as your attire reflects you, and 
not corporate homogeneity, you’ll be fine. If not, you can change outfits 
instantly. The Library folder in your Inventory has a variety of designer ava­
tars from which you can mix and match to get started.

302
Part IV: E-Mail, Chat, and Other Ways to Hang Out Online 
The easiest way is to right-click your character, choose Edit Appearance, and 
take off all your clothes. Then you can design new costume pieces one by one 
and click Save As Outfit to name them. Don’t neglect the Create Skirt button, 
even if your character is male — with a few tweaks, it can be used to create 
coats, cloaks, and capes.
After you’ve done that, you can begin your Second Life journey. A few things 
you may be interested in doing are listed here:
	
✓	Collect free stuff: Search for freebies or ask around for places with free 
clothes, tools, or animations.
	
✓	Join a group: Search for groups through the search engine or look in the 
profiles of interesting people you meet.
	
✓	Shop: Everywhere you go are items for you to spend your money on.
	
✓	Build: Search for a “sandbox” area where you can use the builder to con­
struct more elaborate objects. This process takes a while to get good at, 
but can be quite rewarding. You can use in-world scripting and particle 
tools for programming objects.
Who’s Linden?
Linden dollars are the currency of Second Life. As in the real world, you don’t 
get far without them. Fortunately, you don’t need to buy food or transporta­
tion, but you can still empty your virtual pocketbook in plenty of ways. Here 
are some uses for Linden dollars:
	
✓	Shopping: If you don’t want to create everything yourself, you want 
some Linden dollars to decorate and adorn your character (and home, if 
you have one). You can buy better clothes than standard issue or items 
for your home, such as furniture and trees.
	
✓	Designing: You must pay a small fee to upload objects and screen shots 
into Second Life. At this point, you can sell them, give them away, or 
trade them with other players.
	
✓	Buying land: You need a premium account to do this, but you can buy 
virtual property to use a house, club, clubhouse, store, or whatever 
strikes your fancy. If you don’t want to pay for an account, you might 
want to rent from another resident.
We hope that you already have a few Linden dollars. If not, look into acquir­
ing some. Here are a few ways to make money:

303
 Chapter 17: Games and Worlds on the Web
	
✓	Sign-up bonus: You get this money just for registering.
	
✓	Direct purchase: If you can afford it, you can simply exchange U.S. dol­
lars for Linden bucks.
	
✓	Stipend: A more effective way to get money may be to shell out for a 
premium account. You pay a monthly fee but get a weekly stipend and 
the right to own land.
	
✓	Sales: Write scripts, design objects, write music, or take pictures and 
you can sell them to other players. You need some money to get started 
because it costs a small number of Linden dollars to upload your cre­
ations, but after that, it can be both fun and rewarding. You also retain 
real-world rights to your creations.
Is virtual stuff worth something in the real world?
After lots of people started playing in virtual 
worlds (gaming worlds and Second Life), they 
began creating things of value, even if these 
“things” exist only as ones and zeroes in a 
computer. (Hey, your checking account exists 
in your bank’s computer in the same way.) An 
online character with lots of experience points, 
a beautifully designed costume (or body), or 
a well-placed chunk of real estate (virtual 
estate?) can be an object of envy to other 
gamers.
Naturally, an industry sprouted as soon as 
gamers figured this out. Experienced play­
ers realized that they could create a valuable 
character or item in the game and then sell it 
to a newbie for real money, and began doing 
so. An entire industry, gold farming, was born, 
and third world countries, with low-wage work­
ers make up the bulk of it. Chinese workers can 
make good money playing World of Warcraft or 
other games in ten-hour shifts to gain points or 
experience level for gamers too lazy — er, too 
busy — to do it themselves. When one study 
was done in 2007, 1000g (an amount of virtual 
gold in World of Warcraft) on U.S. servers 
was worth about $260 in real dollars. Online 
game companies usually outlaw gold farming 
and close their accounts, but where there’s 
demand, there will always be supply.

Putting Your Own 
Stuff on the Net
 

In this part . . .
T
he Internet is different from other computer networks 
because it’s flat — every computer is, in principle, 
equal to every other. So, there’s no excuse for being a 
virtual couch potato and just looking at other people’s 
stuff — you can publish your own. We look at different 
ways you can make or contribute to Web sites, such as 
photo gallery sites, video sharing sites, blogs, and social 
networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace, includ­
ing making your own Web site, either from scratch or (the 
easy way) by using a wiki or page creator site.

B
ack at the dawn of the World Wide Web (in 1989), the plan was that 
people all over the world would communicate among themselves — a 
virtual rustic global village. That’s not exactly how it turned out, with giant 
megamalls like Amazon.com making the Net a distinctly nonrustic experience. 
However, after you’ve used the Internet and browsed the Web for a while, 
you’ll probably think of putting your own material on the Web. Hey, you’ve 
got interesting things to say, probably more interesting than a lot of Web sites 
you’ve surfed past!
Yes, it’s time to stop just browsing the Web and start putting yourself out 
there in various ways. This chapter takes you through a bunch of ways you 
can post information on the Web, and explains how to use the ones that are 
the easiest to start with.
Ways to Go Public on the Web
You can post information on the Internet in lots of different ways. Some 
require more start-up effort than others. Here’s an overview of the best 
­methods for putting your own information online:
	
✓	Join a social network: Web sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and 
MySpace started as glorified personal ads, and have expanded to 
include photos, video, e-mail, blogs, polls — you name it. See the section 
“Presenting Your Online Self,” later in this chapter.

308
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
	
✓	Create photo galleries: Many sites enable you to create an online gallery 
of photos or other pictures. Make your gallery public or share it with 
only friends and family. See the later section “Say ‘Cheese!’”
	
✓	Share videos: If you have home videos, animated movies, or other digi­
tal video you created or edited using software on your PC or Mac, you 
can post it on a number of video sites. See the section “The Internet’s 
Funniest Home Videos,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Share documents, spreadsheets, and calendars: Post word process­
ing documents or spreadsheets that selected others can view or edit, 
and create calendars that others can see and change. See the section 
“Sharing Documents and Calendars,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Sell stuff: Sell goods or services in an online storefront or auction. See 
the section “Setting Up an Online Shop,” at the end of this chapter.
	
✓	Write a Web log (blog): Create an online diary or journal with chrono­
logical entries. Chapter 19 describes how to read blogs and write your 
own blog.
	
✓	Use Twitter to let your friends know what you’re up to: Twitter is a 
little, tiny blog where you post short messages (tweets) and read other 
people’s messages. See Chapter 19.
	
✓	Produce podcasts: If you’re a musician, storyteller, minister, or teacher 
or you just think you have something to say, you can post digital record­
ings on the Web. See Chapter 19.
	
✓	Create a collaborative Web site: A wiki enables you and your friends or 
co-workers to edit a set of Web pages together. See Chapter 20.
	
✓	Build a handcrafted Web site: You can use Google Sites, Homestead, 
Weebly, or a Web page editor to create a Web site with pages of your 
choosing. See Chapter 20 to find out how.
Presenting Your Online Self
Facebook, LinkedIn, and MySpace are social networking sites, which make it 
easy to make a Web page about yourself without having to know how to use 
HTML. Then you can use your Web page to communicate with friends, orga­
nize events, create committees, and meet new people.
Social networking sites have become hugely popular with all kinds of people. 
Facebook (www.facebook.com) was started for college students and 
expanded to teenagers in general, but the fastest-growing group of users 
these days is folks over 40. Now, every political candidate who’s serious 
needs a Facebook presence. LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) is designed for 
making business contacts. Many musical groups (especially rock bands) have 
also found MySpace (www.myspace.com) to be a good place to communi­
cate with fans.

309
 Chapter 18: Making a Splash Online
Since their creation, these sites have been a way for people to publish their 
thoughts and ideas on the Internet, for free. The sites have also opened a 
huge window for up-and-coming musicians, poets, and other performers, 
helping many people rise in their careers.
Figure 18-1 shows a typical Facebook page (okay, it’s the page of one of the 
authors), also known as a profile. Your page can include photos, videos, a 
blog (described in the later section “What’s in a Blog?”), and other elements 
to present the Real You (or, optionally, the Fake You).
	
Figure 18-1: 
Social 
networking 
sites display 
information 
about you 
and make 
links to your 
friends.
	
You can find a bunch of social networking sites on Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.
org); search for list of social networking sites. Facebook is the most popular, so 
we describe it in this section. How do you decide which social network to join? 
Ask your friends which networks they belong to.
	
Because social networking is trendy, it has a vast number of sites, most of 
which will never amount to anything. Some sites are popular in such specific 
niches as Spoke.com which is popular among salespeople, and Google’s Orkut.
com which is inexplicably popular among Brazilians, but if you’ve never heard 
of a site, likely nobody else has heard of it, either. Before joining a site, think of 
people you’d expect to find there, and search for them. If you don’t find at 
least a few of them, the site isn’t likely to interest you. Some sleazier wannabe 
sites scoop all the addresses out of members’ address books and send invita­
tions “from” them, so if you receive an invitation you weren’t expecting, first 
write back to the alleged sender and see whether they intended to invite you.
Different sites have different age restrictions for users, along with rules that 
apply to all users regardless of age. Facebook, like most networking sites, 
requires users to be 13 or older.

Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Setting up your social site
To create your own page on a social networking site, the steps work like this:
	
1.	Go to the Web site where you want to create a site, such as www.
facebook.com.
	
2.	Find the Sign Up or Register button. Follow the instructions to create 
an account, which is free. Some sites send a confirmation message to 
your e-mail, containing a link that you must click to prove that your 
address is what you say it is. On Facebook and MySpace, you specify a 
username that becomes part of the Web address of your site. (If your 
username is elvispresley on Facebook, your site is www.facebook.
com/elvispresley).
	
3.	Set up your account. Depending on the site, you’re asked for different 
kinds of information. Facebook prompts you to join one or more net­
works based on geography (people in your town), people who went to 
your college, or people at your company.
	
4.	Edit your profile. Click the Profile or Edit Profile button or link to enter 
the information you want to display on your pages. You may be asked 
for your gender, age, political leanings, religious views, hometown, 
phone number, mailing address, school name (current or past), sexual 
orientation, marital status, activities, favorite music — you name it. 
Enter only what you’re comfortable sharing!
	
5.	 Choose your security settings. Look for settings that enable you to 
control who can see this information; we recommend that you not 
share your hometown (unless it’s a big, big city), birthdate, or other 
identifying information. In Facebook, click Settings and then Privacy 
Settings to control who can see what. While you’re at it, set your noti­
fications; Facebook can e-mail you or send a text message when you 
receive various types of Facebook events.
	
6.	Take a look at your page. In Facebook, click Profile. In MySpace, click 
Home. Make sure that you’re comfortable with the entire world reading 
the information that’s there — keeping in mind your boss, your minister, 
your kids, your parents, and that creep who compelled you to change 
your phone number to get away from him. (You get the idea.)
	
7.	Upload pictures, if you want. You can upload photos from your PC, 
organize them into albums, add captions, and even click individual faces 
in your photos and identify them. (Very cool.) The Facebook system 
notifies any other Facebook users you identify in your photos so that 
they can take a look.
Finally, you have your own home page! At Facebook, you’re at www.
facebook.com followed by your username. At MySpace — same idea.

311
 Chapter 18: Making a Splash Online
Keeping your page current
Some people check their profiles once a week to see whether new comments 
or messages are posted online. Others feel the need to update and redesign 
their accounts daily. (Perhaps these people check their voice mail every 
hour, too.) It’s all up to you — that’s why they call it MySpace.
Updating pictures is an easy way to keep your page current. New photos 
change the look of your profile and allow users to comment (“Where were 
you and what were you doing?!” “New shirt?”).
MySpace and Facebook enable you to add other elements to your profile, like 
a Weblog (blog) of your news and musings or posting notes on your and your 
friends’ “walls” (a section of your Facebook page).
Updating from Your iPhone
	
If you have an iPhone or iPod touch, download the free Facebook or MySpace 
Mobile app so that you can view and update your site from that cute little 
device. The app enables you to post profile updates, read messages, and look 
at your friends’ pages, as shown in Figure 18-2. When you take a picture or 
video, you can send it directly to Facebook or MySpace for posting.
	
Figure 18-2: 
Use a 
smartphone 
“app” to 
update your 
profile from 
anywhere.

Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Making connections
The whole point of social networking sites is, believe it or not, social net­
working. Your site isn’t complete until it includes links to lots of friends — 
preferably, people you actually know. (Why add a stranger as your friend if 
the person is a stranger?)
On Facebook, click Friends and then click the Find Friends tab. If you store 
your friends’ e-mail addresses in your Yahoo! Mail, Google Gmail, Windows 
Live Hotmail, or AOL, Facebook offers to search your address book for the 
addresses of people who have Facebook accounts. A scary feature (but we 
tried it anyway) was uploading the address book from our e-mail program so 
that Facebook could identify people with Facebook accounts that we might 
want to invite to be our Facebook friends. Or, you can search for friends, rela­
tives, or classmates. Click Friends and type names in the Search Friends box.
After you have friends, you can send them messages, look at their pages, 
view their photos, look at their friends, and (depending on people’s privacy 
settings) look at their friends’ pages. You see their walls, which you can write 
on (leave a note) — it’s a kind of personalized digital graffiti.
LinkedIn works a little differently because its emphasis is on making business 
connections. After you’ve linked up to your business contacts, you can write 
recommendations of other people, pose questions, and answer questions. 
The idea is to garner recommendations and write useful answers so that 
people looking for employees or contractors see your profile and decide to 
contact you through a mutual connection.
Say “Cheese!”
We love sharing our family photos with other people, and the Web makes it 
easy. Also, sharing over the Web saves you the cost of making extra prints 
of your snapshots, and it’s quick. Several Web sites enable you to upload 
your digital pictures to the sites and share the pictures with your friends and 
family. These free photo-sharing sites make their money by selling prints — 
after your family sees that gorgeous shot of little Mary finger-painting with 
pudding, they’ll have to have a copy for the fridge!
	
Of course, the most popular way to share pictures is on Facebook!

313
 Chapter 18: Making a Splash Online
You can try one of these photo-sharing sites:
	
✓	Flickr (part of Yahoo!), at flickr.com: This is probably the biggest 
photo-sharing site. Upload pictures from your computer, e-mail them, or 
send them from your phone — videos, too. Flickr gives you the choice 
of making photos public to all Flickr users, accessible only to specific 
groups of people, or completely private.
	
✓	Picasa (from Google), at picasa.google.com: Picasa combines a free 
photo-organizing program with a web-based picture-sharing site, at 
picasaweb.google.com.
	
✓	Photobucket (owned by Fox), at photobucket.com: This site hosts 
both pictures and video.
	
✓	Windows Live Photos, at profile.live.com or photos.live.
com: When you log in with your Windows Live ID, you get a profile that 
includes calendars, instant messaging, and (most germane to file-
sharing) a Photos section where you can create albums and upload pic­
tures. You can also see photos that your friends have tagged as contain­
ing you. Click Photos and then Create a Photo Album, type a name for 
the album, and then choose the photos to update into your new album.
	
✓	HP Snapfish, at www.snapfish.com, lets you set up online photo 
albums using either photos you upload or rolls of film you mail in to the 
site. You can share the albums and order prints.
Picture formats
Pictures come in dozens of formats. Fortunately, 
only three picture formats are in common use on 
the Web: GIF, JPEG, and PNG. Many lengthy — 
er, free and frank discussions have occurred 
on the Internet concerning the relative merits of 
these formats. John, who is an Official Graphics 
Format Expert, by virtue of having persuaded 
two otherwise reputable publishers to publish 
his books on the topic, suggests that photo­
graphs work better in JPEG format, whereas 
clip art, icons, and cartoons are better in PNG 
or GIF. If you’re in doubt, JPEG files are smaller, 
and download faster. PNG is a superior, new 
replacement for GIF, and its only disadvantage 
is that people with very old browsers (Netscape 
3.0 and older, for example) can’t easily view 
PNG files.
If you have a picture in any other format, 
such as BMP or PCX, you must convert it 
to GIF, JPEG, or PNG before you can use it 
on the Web. Windows comes with Paint, 
which you can run by choosing Start➪All 
Programs➪Accessories➪Paint. Or, check out 
Tucows at tucows.com/downloads/
Windows or try Download.com at www.
download.com for graphics programs that 
can convert file formats. For the Mac, consider 
GraphicConverter at www.lemkesoft.de 
and click the American flag for the English ver­
sion of the site.

314
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
After you create an account at one of these sites, you can upload photos into 
online photo albums by filling out forms on the Web site. Then you can share 
your albums with your friends. If you want, you can make your photos on 
these sites invisible to the general public — only to the people with whom 
you share the album.
You (and your friends) can also order prints of your uploaded photos — 
that’s how these sites make their money. The prices for prints are reason­
able, and we find these systems convenient. You can print your photos as 
calendars, cards, books, and even postage stamps.
	
Another way to share photos is to include them on a blog, as described in 
Chapter 19. Blogs are useful if you want to use your photos to illustrate a nar­
rative, like the story of your trip to Spain.
Organizing your photos, too
Several programs help you organize the pictures on your computer as well 
as uploading and sharing them online. Picasa is the Google photo manage­
ment program, which you can download from www.picasa.com or picasa.
google.com. The program finds the photos on your computer (identifying 
them by their filename extensions) and helps you organize, caption, and edit 
them. They then enable you to upload the photos or albums to their Web site 
for sharing with your friends and family. Figure 18-3 shows the Picasa photo-
sharing Web site.

 Chapter 18: Making a Splash Online
Windows Live Gallery comes as part of a bundle of programs that you can 
download for free from download.live.com, as described in the sidebar 
“Windows Live Essentials” in Chapter 13. Like Picasa, this program organizes 
and uploads your photos.
The Internet’s Funniest Home Videos
It would be hard to live in the 21st century and not have heard of YouTube 
(at youtube.com), the popular video-sharing Web site owned by Google. 
YouTube and similar sites, like Dailymotion (dailymotion.com/us), 
Flickr (flickr.com), Google Video (video.google.com), Photobucket 
(photobucket.com), Veoh (www.veoh.com), and Yahoo! Video (video.
yahoo.com), store huge libraries of videos that you can search and watch. 
To watch videos on YouTube and other video-sharing sites, see the section 
“Watching Movies on the Net” in Chapter 9.
You can post videos on these sites, too, as long as your video isn’t longer than 
about ten minutes. (Different sites may have different limits.) Use your video 
camera, digital camera, or phone to shoot a short movie and transfer it to 
your PC. Then you can upload your video. On YouTube, you sign up for a free 
account first and then click the Upload Videos link on any YouTube page.
If you have a cellphone that takes video, you can upload videos from your 
cellphone and post them to social networking sites like Facebook. The built-
in iPhone Camera program enables you to shoot video, and then gives you 
the option of e-mailing or uploading it to YouTube.
Sharing Documents and Calendars
Have you ever wished that you could share a spreadsheet or word process­
ing document with other people, and maybe even let them let them make 
changes? For example, you’re the commissioner of a fantasy football league 
and you want to share a spreadsheet of players and their statistics with the 
other players. Yeah, you could print the spreadsheet and pass it around, 
but what if you make updates? Instead, you can upload the spreadsheet to a 
document-sharing site and share it with the other players.
Or, a document or spreadsheet might be just for you, but you need to be 
able to edit from more than one computer. Our kids use a document-sharing 
site to work on their school papers both at home and at school — it’s much 
easier than copying their files to a thumb drive or disk, which they’d prob­
ably forget on the kitchen counter, right next to their lunch.

316
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Several document-sharing sites allow you to use the Web as your word pro­
cessing, spreadsheet, or presentation program, storing your files online. You 
can see, edit, and print your documents, spreadsheets, and presentations 
from any computer that’s on the Internet. In fact, these sites are so good that 
some people use them for all their documents and spreadsheets, even if they 
have word processing and spreadsheet programs on their computers.
Making a Google Doc
The most popular document-sharing site is Google Docs, at docs.google.
com. Google Docs doesn’t support every advanced feature of Microsoft Word 
and Excel, but it handles all the basics. Figure 18-4 shows a Google spread­
sheet. The toolbar just above the spreadsheet provides formatting options, 
like a “real” spreadsheet, and the menu bar (File, Edit, View, and so on) pro­
vides other spreadsheet features. You can print your spreadsheet, presenta­
tion, or document or export it in a standard format.
	
Figure 18-4: 
A group 
of people 
can view 
and edit 
a Google 
Docs 
spread-
sheet.
	
To get started with Google Docs, follow these steps:
	
1.	Sign in at docs.google.com with your Google account username and 
password.
	
	 Or, if you’re already signed in at another Google site, click Documents 
on the list of Google services at the top of the screen. Either way, you 
see the Google Docs screen, with a list of the documents and spread­
sheets that you can view or edit.

317
 Chapter 18: Making a Splash Online
	
2.	To upload a word processing document, presentation, or spreadsheet 
from your computer, click Upload, click Browse, and select the file to 
import. Then click Upload File.
	
	 Google Docs uploads the file and creates a new document, presentation, 
or spreadsheet that you can edit and share.
	
3.	To create a new document, presentation, or spreadsheet from scratch 
(rather than uploading it), choose New➪Document, New➪Presentation, 
or New➪Spreadsheet.
	
	 Hey, the New menu has a bunch of other options, too (maybe more 
since we wrote this chapter), like Presentation, which enables you to 
create a PowerPoint-style set of slides.
	
	 Google creates a new element of the type you chose and displays it on 
the screen, with the appropriate menu bar and icons for editing.
	
4.	If you created the file from scratch, give it a name. Choose File➪Rename 
from the menu bar in Google Docs (not the menu bar at the top of your 
browser window) and type a name.
	
5.	Type in the document, presentation, or spreadsheet as usual.
	
	 If you made a spreadsheet, click in a cell and then type in it. To edit a 
cell, double-click it or click it and press F2.
	
6.	When Google Docs asks whether to start autosaving your information, 
click Start Autosaving.
	
	 Google saves your data in the cloud, that is, the innumerable Web serv­
ers that Google maintains and that we never have to see or worry about. 
It saves your changes every few minutes, so you’re unlikely to lose your 
work.
Sharing the wealth
After you have a document or spreadsheet (or presentation) in Google Docs, 
you can share it with other people. Click the Share button and choose Invite 
People. Cut and paste or type the addresses of people you want to share the 
information with. Click To Edit if you want to allow them to make changes 
to your document or spreadsheet, or To View if they can look but not touch. 
Enter the subject and text of the e-mail message that Google Docs will send to 
invite them to look at your document or spreadsheet, and click Send.
Your invitees receive a message explaining how to access the information 
you’re sharing.
	
You can also give people a Web address they can use to view the document 
or spreadsheet (no editing). Click Share and choose Get the Link to Share to 
see a rather long URL that you can e-mail or IM to people so that they can 
take a look.

318
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Making and sharing an online calendar
Another kind of information you can share is an online calendar. Maybe your 
club, church, theater, or whatever holds public events. Or, maybe they have 
a schedule of meetings to share with a small group of people. Either way, 
you can make an online calendar, enter events or meetings on it, and make it 
available for viewing or editing.
Google Calendars, at calendar.google.com, enables you to make one or 
more calendars, share them with other people, and make them public. You 
can display more than one calendar, overlaid in different colors, so that you 
can see your own events alongside your friends or co-workers. Microsoft has 
a similar service at calendar.live.com.
Margy’s family has a Google calendar for our family events. On the computer 
in her kitchen, family members refer to the online calendar rather than to the 
traditional coffee-stained paper wall calendar. We sync our Google calendar 
with the calendars on our smartphones or other devices, such as the iPhone 
or iPod touch. Okay, we are geeks, but it sure is convenient to have a shared 
family calendar with us all the time!
Beyond Google Docs
Google Docs isn’t the only online document-sharing site. Zoho (www.zoho.
com) offers free accounts (you can even log in using your Google account 
name) that you can use to create a share several types of files. Zoho Writer 
has more formatting options than Google Docs. Zoho Sheet provides online 
spreadsheets. Zoho Show makes slide show presentations. Holy cow — it’s a 
complete Microsoft Office-like set of programs, all for free!
Not surprisingly, Microsoft has decided to play this game, too. If you go to 
Microsoft Office Live, at www.officelive.com, you can create (surprise!) 
documents, presentations, and spreadsheets by uploading them or making 
them from scratch. To get started, sign in with your Windows Live account 
(or make one for free).
Setting Up an Online Shop
Selling stuff on the Internet used to take hundreds of thousands of dollars 
worth of software and programming talent. A number of sites now let you 
create Web stores for very modest fees. Here are a few:

319
 Chapter 18: Making a Splash Online
	
✓	Amazon.com Marketplace, at sellercentral.amazon.com, is easy 
to set up. Sign in with an Amazon.com account (the same account you 
use if you buy books or other items on the site), click Your Account, and 
click Your Seller Account to find out how to set up a seller account. Or, 
search Amazon.com for the item you want to sell and click the Sell Yours 
Here button. The site even processes credit card sales for you, eliminat­
ing what was once a horrible pain in the neck.
	
✓	eBay.com Stores, at pages.ebay.com/sellercentral, enables you to 
sell items in auctions (for which eBay is famous) or at fixed prices (using 
the Buy It Now option). Your store can have its own name and logo, and 
items in your store show up when people search eBay for merchandise.
	
✓	Yahoo!, at smallbusiness.yahoo.com, lets you create a storefront 
for a monthly fee.
To set up a store, you sign up for a free account at the Web site and then 
click the link to create the store. You provide information about the items 
you sell, including descriptions, prices, and shipping costs.
	
If you don’t want to set up a whole store, you can still sell individual items 
either on consignment at sites like www.half.com or at auction at sites like 
www.ebay.com. eBay owns Half.com, so when you set up an account to buy 
or sell items on one, you’re ready to buy or sell on the other, too.
To sell an item on Half.com (or any other consignment site), first find the 
item you want to sell, as shown in Figure 18-5. Half specializes in books, 
movies, and music, and it has almost everything in print in its database. 
When you find your item, click the Sell My Copy link, specify the condition of 
the item, add a description, and state your asking price. When you click the 
List Item link, your listing goes into the Half.com database and appears on 
the site within an hour. When you sell your item — which could be minutes, 
hours, or months later — Half.com keeps a commission.

Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Selling an item on eBay is similar for books, CDs, and DVDs, but for other 
items it can be a little more complicated. You write a description for the item 
and take or scan a digital picture of it. Start at www.ebay.com, click the Sell 
tab or link, and follow the directions. Auctions can last as long as seven days, 
or you can set up a fixed-price offer with no end date. eBay charges you a list­
ing fee, although if your item doesn’t sell, you can usually relist it (try again, 
perhaps with a lower starting price) for free. Click Help at the bottom of any 
eBay page, and then Selling Basics, for instructions and hints for selling.

Chapter 19
Blogs and Twitter
In This Chapter
▶	Reading other people’s online diaries (also known as blogs)
▶	Making your own blog
▶	Tweeting what’s happening right now on Twitter
D
iaries are as old as writing. (We made up that statement, but it may 
well be true.) However, diaries that every single person on the entire 
Internet can read are a more recent invention. Not many people have always 
dreamed of publishing their diaries, but lots of people want to write regular 
columns where they can express their opinion, tell stories, or post pictures. 
Blogs have made that expression possible, easy, and free.
If you’re not an enthusiastic and voluminous writer and you want to post 
tiny articles or journal entries, Twitter was invented for you. This chapter 
explains how blogs work, including microblogs (the technical term for what 
Twitter is).
What’s in a Blog?
A Weblog, usually abbreviated as blog, is a public online diary where some­
one posts more or less regular updates. A blog uses software that lets you 
easily post entries by using your Web browser — no additional software is 
needed. You can even post updates from your mobile phone.
Most blogs are updated frequently by one author and contain short, dated 
entries, as in a diary, with the newest ones at the top. Other blogs are more 
complex, with multiple topics or pictures as well as or instead of words, but 
they retain the idea of relatively short entries, updated relatively often. 
Figure 19-1 shows the political blog of a friend of ours, Doug Muder 
(weeklysift.blogspot.com).

The best blogs offer cutting-edge journalism and commentary and brilliant, 
witty, sparkling writing, whereas the worst disprove the old cliché that a mil­
lion monkeys at a million typewriters would eventually produce the works 
of Shakespeare. If you search Google.com for the word blog or weblog and 
some topic words that are of interest to you, you’ll invariably find someone 
blogging away at it. But keep reading to find out better ways to discover and 
organize the blogs you read.
As blogs have become more popular, many Web sites have added blogs to 
post news, gossip, or behind-the-scenes stories. Every New York Times 
columnist (at www.nytimes.com) has a blog — go to nytimes.com/blogs 
to see a list. Some sites show the latest blog posting or two in a prominent 
spot, and you can click a link to see older posts.
How to read a blog
Reading a blog is easy because blogs are just Web pages. Point your browser 
at the home page of the one you’re interested in and read it. (Bet you thought 
it would be more complicated than that.) If you want to see more information 
about a particular story, click the link in the story.

 Chapter 19: Blogs and Twitter
Reading one blog is like eating only one potato chip, which never happens. 
When you find one blog, it usually has links to other blogs. If you search for 
one blog on a particular topic, you find a dozen blogs on that subject, and 
before you know it, you’re mired deep in the swamps of Blogistan, with far 
too many interesting blogs to keep track of.
Because blogs change frequently (at least they’re supposed to), you might 
want to bookmark your favorite ones in your Web browser so that you can 
find them again. As you find more blogs, you soon find your bookmark folder 
and your brain exploding from trying to keep track of them.
Luckily, you can subscribe to blogs so that you don’t have to remember to 
return to each blog Web site to read the latest postings. When you subscribe 
to a blog, the new entries arrive on your computer automatically, so you 
don’t have to check the blog Web site.
	
An RSS feed is the blogging feature that enables you to subscribe to the 
blog and receive new postings automagically. (RSS stands for Really Simple 
Syndication.) An RSS feed is a special Web address (URL) that usually ends 
with .rss. When you’re reading a blog in your Web browser, look for a 
Subscribe or RSS link, which should display information about the site’s RSS 
feed. Some blogs use a URL at feedburner.google.com for their feeds.
The system you use to subscribe is an aggregator, although almost no one 
uses the term. One type of aggregator is Web based, a Web site that tracks 
and shows you all your favorite blogs. The other is desktop based, a program 
that lets your computer track and show your favorite blogs.
Your favorite blogs
The following sections describe three of our favorite aggregator Web sites, all free.
Bloglines
www.bloglines.com
Bloglines, shown in Figure 19-2, is the premier site for people who want to 
follow a whole lot of blogs. To get started at Bloglines, you set up a free 
account and then tell it to subscribe to the blogs you’re interested in. If you 
know the RSS feed’s URL, you can enter it directly, but it’s usually easier to 
use the built-in search engine. Type a few words describing blogs you might 
like and pick the likely-looking ones. Many blogs also have a Bloglines button 
you can click to open the Bloglines site and add that blog to your account.

324
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
For each blog, Bloglines tracks the items in the blog and remembers which 
ones you’ve looked at, reporting the number unread in parentheses after the 
name of each blog. That makes it easy to cruise by and catch up on what’s 
new. You can mark stories of interest to add to your private clipping folder, 
and you can also publish a blog of clippings and, optionally, add notes to 
each clipping. (Your clipping blog is a real blog with its own RSS feed, so your 
friends can read it and save entries, and their friends can read their clipping 
blogs, offering nearly theological blogs within blogs within blogs.)
	
Figure 19-2: 
All blogs, all 
the time, at 
Bloglines.
	
Google Reader and iGoogle
www.google.com/reader
google.com/ig
After you log in to your free Google account, you can start subscribing to 
blogs. (This Google account works with all Google services; if you don’t 
already have an account, click a link to create one.) Google Reader offers 
bundles of popular feeds to get you started. To add a blog from Blogger 
(Blogspot), Facebook, Flickr, LiveJournal, MySpace, or several other popular 
blog sites, you can select the site and type the name of the blog. You can 
either click the Add Subscription link at any time to search for a blog by 
name or topic (this is Google, after all) or paste in an RSS feed.
Or, you can add blogs to your Google home page, a.k.a. your iGoogle page. 
When you log in to google.com/ig using your Google username and pass­
word, you see your iGoogle page, which you can configure to display the 
weather, calendars, news, and (of course) your favorite blogs.

325
 Chapter 19: Blogs and Twitter
My Yahoo!
my.yahoo.com
My Yahoo! lets you mix and match the site’s own material with RSS feeds, in 
a two- or three-column format that lets you pack an amazing amount of infor­
mation into one Web page. Any resemblance to iGoogle shows that Google 
knows good ideas when it sees them.
	
Because Bloglines, iGoogle, and My Yahoo! are quite popular, many blogs offer 
a one-click way to add the blog to your subscriptions.
Writing Your Own Blog
Now that you’ve read other people’s blogs, how about starting your own? 
People read blogs for their brilliant, witty, sparkling content. Sparkling is 
hard, and sparkling regularly is exhausting. If you start your own blog, try 
blogging for a while on your own before telling all your friends about it. 
Otherwise: “It was okay at the beginning, but now, big yawn.”
Many blogging sites accept text, phones, and even video as part of your blog. 
You don’t have to decide in advance what kind of material you’ll include.
Can I make big buck$ with my blog?
Probably not. The alleged path to blog riches is 
that you start a blog, fill it with fabulous writing, 
and add some ads down the side and then mil­
lions of people flock to your blog and click the 
ads, and your share of the advertising income 
buys a tropical island where you retire.
A few famous blogs have succeeded with 
this plan, such as Boing Boing (www.boing
boing.net, for eclectic technogossip) 
and Wonkette (www.wonkette.com, for 
Washington, D.C. political gossip), but you 
can probably count them on your fingers, and 
running each one is a full-time job. We’ve 
experimented with ads on some of our blog­
gish Web sites, such as John’s airline infor­
mation site at airinfo.travel or his blog 
about Internet and e-mail policy, at weblog.
johnlevine.com, and we’ve never seen 
more than a few dollars a day, which means 
that our tropical island will be limited to about 
four square inches.
You can put up a blog with ads for free at 
Blogger (www.blogger.com), so you have 
nothing to lose but your time and perhaps your 
self-esteem. Don’t quit your day job quite yet.

326
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Finding where to put your blog
Many big blog sites let you blog away without having to install anything. 
These sites offer a basic usable blog for free. Some also have extra-cost add-
ons that they hope you’ll use. For reasons that will shortly become apparent 
if you read this entire section, we suggest that most of our users try Blogger.
Here are some popular blog-hosting sites:
Blogger
www.blogger.com
Also known as Blogspot, Blogger is now part of the Google empire, although 
Google hasn’t Google-ized it, at least not yet. After you create an account, 
you can add and edit blog entries through the Web site, customize it in any 
of a zillion ways, and publish your blog. Blog entries can include photos and 
videos. You can even post text and pictures from your mobile phone.
Blogger is remarkably uninterested in asking for your money. As far as we 
can figure out, its reason for existence is mostly to be a place for people to 
display Google ads. That’s fine — it’s a nice site, and the ads are entirely 
optional.
LiveJournal
www.livejournal.com
The cliché LiveJournal user is a college student who needs to provide too 
much information to his 100,000 closest friends on topics ranging from taste 
in music to short-term party plans to personal political philosophy. If this 
sounds like you, LiveJournal is the place. Blog entries can include photos, 
video, and other cool stuff.
WordPress
www.wordpress.com
WordPress can provide you with a customizable blog for free. Because its 
software is widely used, lots of plug-ins allow you to mix photos from Flickr, 
posts from Twitter, and other kinds of information directly into your blog. 
You can also create nonjournal pages, such as an About Me page.
Xanga
www.xanga.com

327
 Chapter 19: Blogs and Twitter
Xanga is a lot like LiveJournal except that the average user seems to be about 
five years younger. Unlike the other two sites, Xanga shows its ads on your 
blog unless you buy a premium account. Xanga also includes some social 
networking features, like Facebook and MySpace.
	
You can also add a blog to your Facebook, MySpace, or other social networking
 site. See the section in Chapter 18 about setting up your social site.
When you create a blog at one of these sites, you choose a name for the blog 
and this name plus the site name becomes the Web address of your blog. For 
example, if you name your blog Weekly Sift at blogspot.com, the address of 
the blog is weeklysift.blogspot.com.
Going postal
When you’re ready to post an article, diary entry, story, or rant to your blog, 
you have a number of options:
	
✓	Use your Web browser. Go to the blog’s Web site in your Web browser 
and click the Create Post or New Post link. Type your article, or cut and 
paste it from your word processor. Most blog sites allow you to preview 
your posting before publishing for the world to see.
	
✓	Use a blogging program. The Windows Live package includes Windows 
Live Writer, which can manage blogs on most of the popular blogging 
services as well as on Microsoft’s own spaces.live.com.
Top five reasons not to start your own blog
Blog entries are usually short, so in that spirit, 
we offer you a short list:
	 5.	 You work on your blog when you should 
be working on your day job, annoying your 
co-workers and boss, and you spend hours 
reading other blogs, looking for topics to 
comment on or borrow.
	 4.	 Every conversation or experience becomes 
a potential blog entry rather than part 
of your life (also known as novelist’s 
syndrome).
	 3.	 You try to have strange conversations and 
experiences in order to have something to 
blog (bad novelist’s syndrome).
	 2.	 Everything, no matter how trivial, takes 
on a deep bloggable meaning. (“Did you 
ever notice all the different ways that rain 
streaks the dirt on the side of a city bus?”)
	 1.	 You realize that you have nothing to say.
We practice what we preach here. None of us 
has a personal blog, just work-related ones.

328
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
	
✓	Mail it in. At some blog sites in this list, you can e-mail articles to a spe­
cial address. In Blogger, you click Settings and then Email to set up the 
address.
	
✓	Text it in. Some blog sites — notably, Twitter (see the later section 
“Twittering about Your Life”) @md let you send them text messages that 
are then posted to your blog. You can either set up the blog from your 
phone or register your phone to post messages on a blog you already cre­
ated. Go to go.blogger.com if you use Blogger. A number of third-party 
iPhone apps are available for posting to all the major blogging sites.
For more ways to blog, see Blogging For Dummies, by Susannah Gardner and 
Shane Birley.
Illustrating your blog
Text is so 20th century. (Actually, it’s more 15th century, but who’s count­
ing?) If you find text constraining, just about every blog site, including the 
ones we describe in the preceding section, lets you include pictures as part 
of your blog, often uploaded directly from your mobile phone.
For example, when you’re creating a new post on Blogger (also known as 
Blogspot), you can add a picture or video to your post. You upload it and 
there it is, in your blog!
Blogging in song
If you’re a storyteller or musician, or you just have a lot to say, you can post 
your digital recording on the Web as a podcast, which is an audio blog. You 
can upload any audio file you created yourself, containing music, speech, or 
any sounds you like, and other people can subscribe to it, just like on a blog. 
Chapter 9 describes how to find and subscribe to podcasts.
Several Web sites will host your podcast for free or for a small monthly fee. 
Here are two:
	
✓	Liberated Syndication, at www.libsyn.com, offers accounts starting at 
$5 per month.
	
✓	PodBean, at www.podbean.com, is free for the first 100MB of audio 
files. To store more files, you need to pay a modest monthly fee.

329
 Chapter 19: Blogs and Twitter
After you have a podcast, be sure to submit it to the iTunes Store so that people 
who use iTunes can easily subscribe: Run the free iTunes program (which is 
useful even if you don’t own an i-Anything), click iTunes Store, click Podcasts, 
and click Submit a Podcast. (See Chapter 9 to find out how to use iTunes.)
Twittering about Your Life
Blogs can let the world know the details of your life as it happens. But what 
about the times you’re away from your computer? How can you tell your 
friends right away that you found an outstanding purchase at the mall or that 
you’re stuck in traffic? And, how can you receive these vital messages from 
your friends when you’re on the road? Twitter (at www.twitter.com) is the 
answer. It’s a microblogging service that lets you send in updates as often as 
you want, no matter where you are. This level of detail can, of course be a 
mixed blessing — a friend of ours likens Twitter to a continuously updated 
Christmas letter.
When you create a free Twitter account, you create a blog that allows only very 
short entries, no more than 140 characters each, known as tweets. You can 
send as many tweets as you want, and some people send in many indeed. The 
simplest way is to log in to Twitter and type a line in the box at the top of the 
page, but you can also tweet from any of a vast number of Twitter-compatible 
programs, plug-ins on Web sites such as Facebook, as well as from your mobile 
phone. (See the nearby sidebar “Tweeting from your phone.”)
Gack — it’s a trackback
Bloggers frequently comment on each other. 
Sometimes the comments are nice, sometimes 
they’re not so nice, but they’re certainly, uh, 
involved. Most blogs let visitors leave com­
ments, but the serious discussions are often 
between two or more blogs, with each one 
containing comments on the other blog. Anyone 
reading the blog with comments can see the 
reference to the original blog, but there’s no 
way for someone reading the original to know 
where to look for comments. That’s where 
trackbacks come in.
Let’s say that one blogger — call him John (not 
his real name) — posts a provocative entry in 
his blog. Then a second blogger, Margy (not her 
real name, either) posts “For an utterly priceless 
example of disenchronia, check out this entry in 
John’s blog” with a link to John’s blog. If John’s 
blog software is set up to handle trackbacks, 
Margy’s blog system can tell John’s blog about 
the new link so that John’s blog adds a track­
back note with a link to the comment, thereby 
making the connection two-way.
The original vision of hypertext, of which the 
Web is a quick-and-dirty, hacked-up version, 
made all links two-way. Trackbacks bring the 
real-life Web closer to what it was originally 
supposed to be.

330
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Tweeting from your phone
You can post to Twitter by text-messaging from 
your mobile phone. First, you link your phone 
number to your Twitter account; click the 
Settings button at the top of the page, click the 
Devices tab, and follow the instructions, which 
include sending a text message to prove that 
the number is yours. After that, whenever you 
send a text to the special phone number 40404 
in the United States or 21212 in Canada, Twitter 
posts the message on your Twitter page. If you 
turn on Device Updates on that page, the service 
also sends you a text for each direct message 
and each tweet in the feeds you follow.
The Twitter service is free, but you pay the usual 
charge for sending and receiving messages. If 
you receive as few as five messages a day, 
that’s 150 messages a month, so be sure that 
your phone plan includes enough messages 
that you don’t end up paying by the tweet.
iPhone users can download and install apps to 
display and send tweets, too. The figure here 
shows the free TweetDeck app displaying the 
results of a search. As you can see in the figure, 
iPhone apps can display information from Twitter, 
like what people are saying about “Mad Men.”
Each user’s tweets are visible on a Web page such as twitter.
com/barackobama. Because it would be tedious to have to check 
every page of every person you’re interested in, you can follow other 
Twitter users by clicking the Follow button under their names on 
their Twitter pages. Then on your Twitter home page, you see, in one 
chaotic list, all the tweets from everyone you’re following, as shown 
in Figure 19-3. Twitter indexes all tweets, and you can search for 
words and phrases to find recent tweets of interest.

331
 Chapter 19: Blogs and Twitter
	
Figure 19-3: 
Twitter has 
extremely 
short 
articles — 
and you can 
search the 
world of 
tweets by 
topic.
	
Private tweeting
Normally, your Twitter account is public, which means that anyone can 
follow your tweets. If you’re one of the rare people who would rather not 
have every random person in the world watching what you say, you can go 
to the Settings page and select the Protect My Tweets check box to limit your 
tweets to people you approve.
If your organization wants to create its own private Twitter, you can use 
Yammer, at yammer.com
Using @replies and direct messages
Sometimes, you may want to reply to another user’s message. If you start a 
message with an @ sign and the name of a user, that message is a reply to 
that user. Or, you can insert @user in the middle of a tweet, as a mention. In 
either case, the user you reply to or mention will see your message when she 
clicks the @user button on the Twitter home page. You can also send a direct 
message by typing the letter D, a space, the username, and the message. This 
message isn’t visible to anyone else — only to the person you sent it to.

332
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Specifying a topic by using hash marks
If you particularly like someone’s tweet, on your Twitter home page you can 
mark it as a favorite by clicking the star that appears when you put your mouse 
cursor to the right of the tweet. Put #tag in a tweet to specify that it’s related 
to other tweets with the same topic tag to help people find it.
Twitter has a culture all of its own, but it’s easier just to watch the tweets go 
by and see the style rather than try to explain it.
A surprising number of people and organizations use Twitter to send out 
announcements and updates. They range from pop stars (with Twitter 
account mileycyrus) to politicians (Schwarzenegger) to fictional super-
reporter Roland Hedley (Roland_Hedley). Enter a person’s name or Twitter 
account name in the search box to see the most recent tweets.
Including a Web address in your tweet
Web addresses can be long, and tweets have to be short. What to do? A 
number of URL-shortening Web sites can provide a shorter Web address that 
redirects to the real Web address. The most popular URL-shortener is bit.ly. 
Here’s how to use it:
	
1.	Go to bit.ly in your Web browser.
	
	 (It has no .com on the end.)
	
2.	In the text box on the bit.ly page, type or paste the Web address you 
want to include in a tweet, and then click the Shorten button.
	
	 Bit.ly displays a short Web address (starting with http://bit.ly) that 
redirects to the address you provided.
	
3.	Click the Copy button to copy the shorter address to your clipboard.
	
4.	Paste (or type) the address into your tweet.
	
	 Or, use it anywhere else you want a shorter Web address, such as in an 
e-mail message.
Making Twitter lists
A recent addition to Twitter is lists, where you can create a list of Twitter 
users that have something in common. For example, you can make a list of 
your friends, players on your favorite team, or people who post about a topic 

333
 Chapter 19: Blogs and Twitter
you find interesting. Your list can be public (so anyone can see it), or private 
(just for you). The list appears on your Twitter page so you can click it to see 
tweets from all the people on that list. If you follow a lot of people, lists allow 
you to separate the tweets into topics, so you aren’t stuck seeing them all 
mixed together.
If you make a list public, people can see your list at www.twitter.com/
yourname/listname, where yourname is your Twitter username and 
listname is the name of the list.
Even more ways to tweet
Twitter is so popular that many programs are available to make it easier to 
send tweets, follow people, and find tweets on specific topics. For example, 
TweetDeck (at www.tweetdeck.com) runs on Windows, Macs, and iPhones 
and displays tweets from people you follow, tweets that mention specific 
topics, and newsfeeds from Facebook and MySpace in one window. To find 
other Twitter-related programs search the Web for Twitter applications.

▶	Collaborating on a wiki
▶	Finding or making pictures for your Web site
▶	Making a real Web site using a site-builder
▶	Registering a domain name
▶	Getting the word out about your site
I
n Chapter 18, we list a bunch of ways that you can put information on the 
Web, like posting pictures on a photo-sharing site, participating in a social 
networking site, or writing journal entries or articles on a blogging site. Those 
ways are terrific, just terrific — we love them all — but they may not be 
enough for you. What if you want more? What if you need a Web site with a 
bunch of pages, with titles you choose, about topics you choose, and maybe 
even with your own domain name? Okay, you’re ready for the next step.
There are (as usual), several ways to create a site over which you have more 
control than the types of sites described in Chapters 18 and 19. This chapter 
describes how you can use a wiki to make a site with as many pages as you like 
and how to use a page creator site, such as Weebly or Google Sites. Finally, we 
tell you how to register a domain name. (However, we have to warn you that all 
the short and pronounceable domain names are already taken.)
Working Together on a Wiki
Wikis were designed to enable groups of people to work together to make 
and maintain Web sites, but wikis are helpful for setting up single-creator 
sites, too. A wiki (named for the interterminal bus at Honolulu International 
Airport, which is in turn named for the Hawaiian word wiki-wiki, which
 literally means “in a hurry” — no, really) can have an unlimited number
of authors, all of whom can add and change pages within the wiki Web site. 

336
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Unlike a blog, it doesn’t have to be a sequence of journal entries. Instead, you 
can organize your text any way you like, including making as many new, 
interlinked pages as you like.
If this process sounds potentially chaotic when you have more than one author, 
it is, but most wikis have ground rules that keep the group moving in more 
or less the same direction. A wiki can work well if it has a single author or if 
it has a group of people who trust each other to edit each other’s writing. For 
example, a group of co-workers can make a wiki that contains information 
about a project they’re working on. A church or club can make a wiki with 
committee meeting minutes, mission statements, plans, and schedules.
The biggest wiki of them all is Wikipedia, shown in Figure 20-1, at www.
wikipedia.org, a collaborative encyclopedia which, with more than 3 mil­
lion entries (in English, plus millions in other languages), is well on its way to 
including all human knowledge. Most pages have an Edit link so that you can 
add what you know. Some pages have a sidebar with complaints about the 
article from the Wikipedia editors, begging you to help improve it.
	
Figure 20-1: 
The 
Wikipedia 
has articles 
on almost 
everything 
— and you 
can add 
missing 
articles.
	
Weaving your own wiki
You can create your own wiki in one of two ways:
	
✓	Set up a Web site and install wiki software. The wiki program that 
Wikipedia uses is MediaWiki (at www.mediawiki.org). This method 
assumes that you know how to install a program on a Web server, so it 
probably isn’t your best option.

337
 Chapter 20: Making Your Own Web Site
	
✓	Use a wiki farm, which is a Web server that already runs wiki 
software. Wikipedia has a list of wiki farms — look up wiki farm. We’ve 
had good luck with Wikispaces at www.wikispaces.com. Another site 
is Wetpaint, at www.wetpaint.com, which includes social networking 
features.
When you sign up for a wiki at a wiki farm, you may need to pay a monthly 
or yearly fee, or you may have the option to run the wiki for free in return for 
displaying ads. After you create your account and name your wiki, you can 
invite your collaborators to use it, usually by typing or pasting their e-mail 
addresses into a form so that the system can send them invitations. Every 
user has a username and password so that only they can make changes to 
the wiki content.
Wiki farms usually let you name your wiki, and the Web address of the 
wiki combines your name and their name. For example, Figure 20-2 shows 
a church that uses a wiki for its Web site. The leaders of the congregation 
have permission to edit the pages, and others can just look at them. The site 
is hosted at Wikispaces, so its Web address is cvuus.wikispaces.com 
because the initials of the congregation’s name are CVUUS.
	
Figure 20-2: 
You can use 
a wiki to 
make a Web 
site about 
anything, as 
long as you 
aren’t picky 
about the 
page layout.
	
Wiki pros and cons
There’s a lot to like about wikis, but they aren’t perfect. Some advantages are 
described in this list:

338
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
	
✓	Wikis are free, if you don’t mind ads. Some wiki farms give adfree 
accounts to schools and other nonprofits. Some allow you to pay an 
annual fee to eliminate the ads.
	
✓	Wikis are quick to set up — you can usually get started in minutes.
	
✓	You don’t have to have special software (like a Web site editor) to edit 
wiki pages. Instead, you click the Edit link on a page and make changes 
directly in your browser. You may have to learn a simple set of punctuation 
(wiki markup) to create headings and apply bold and italics. Or, your 
wiki software may provide a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) 
visual editor.
	
✓	Wiki markup is simpler to learn than HTML, the markup language that 
all Web pages use, as described in the nearby sidebar “Why you don’t 
care (much) about HTML.”
	
✓	You can upload pictures and make them appear on wiki pages.
	
✓	At some wiki farms, you can register your own domain name and use it 
as your wiki’s address. (See the section “Be the Master of Your Domain,” 
later in this chapter.)
	
✓	A group of people can collaborate on a wiki, each person making 
changes to the pages and creating new ones.
So what’s wrong with wikis? Here are some drawbacks:
	
✓	On most wikis, you can’t control who can edit which page. Someone who 
has permission to edit pages can edit any page. (Better wiki software 
may be on its way, though.)
	
✓	You have limited control over the format of your wiki pages. Links are 
usually listed down the side with a title at the top and a single column of 
text and pictures. Making more columns is hard.
	
✓	Most wikis require that all pages in your site have the same layout — the 
same look. You can’t control where your navigation links appear or the 
background color of your pages. Some wikis display Main Page as the 
title of your home page, which is particularly ugly.
A wiki is an excellent way to get started with a Web site. Wikis are cool, 
but you don’t have much control of how your pages look. Wikis emphasize 
collaboration over graphic design. If you become frustrated by the limited 
formatting options, you’ll know that you’re ready to move to a more custom­
izable program. In the meantime, refer to Wikis For Dummies, by Dan Woods 
and Peter Thoeny.

If you’re ready to take more control over the look of your Web site, consider 
using one of a number of page creator sites that have sprung up. These sites 
enable you to you design what you want your site to look like, create a home 
page for the site, and create as many other pages as you want. Different 
pages can have different layouts.
Page creator sites offer a variety of features, so look carefully before 
choosing one:
	
✓	The site may be free or may incur a monthly charge. Free sites often 
display ads over which you have little control.
	
✓	Some page creator sites allow more customization of the design than 
others. Some let you see the HTML (Web page code) that makes up your 
pages and tweak it so that your pages look just right. Others don’t 
allow this.
Why you don’t care (much) about HTML
Just so you know what HTML is, in case some­
one asks, it stands for HyperText Markup 
Language, the language used for formatting 
Web pages. Web pages are made up of text and 
pictures that are stuck together and formatted 
with HTML codes. Fortunately, you have waited 
until now to start creating a Web page: Clever 
page-creator Web sites and programs are 
available that let you create your pages and 
then write the HTML codes for you automati­
cally so that you don’t have to write the codes 
yourself.
If you want to write a lot of Web pages, you 
should eventually master some HTML. Although 
complex, interactive pages require a fair 
amount of programming, the basics aren’t all 
that complicated. The HTML for complicated is 
<b>complicated</b> (that’s <b> for bold 
type). In case you decide that you want to be in 
the Web-page creation business, entire books 
have been written about how to do it. Stick to 
recent titles because extensions to HTML are 
evolving at a furious pace, and the books go 
out of date in less than a year. We recommend 
HTML, XHTML & CSS For Dummies, 6th Edition, 
written by Ed Tittel and Jeff Noble (Wiley) for 
the basics, and Web Design in a Nutshell, 3rd 
Edition, written by Jennifer Niederst (O’Reilly 
Media) for more advanced information.

✓	Your site can be a subdomain of the page creator site (that is, your Web 
address is their address with www replaced by a name you choose).
	
✓	Page creator sites offer lots of standard designs. See whether any sites 
have a design you like.
	
✓	Some sites let you include message boards, guest books, blogs, calen­
dars, photo galleries, and video on your site. Some help you sell items 
on your site, with connections to PayPal for checkout.
	
✓	The amount of information you can store on your Web site varies, along 
with the maximum number of pages.
Here are some page creator sites we know about:
	
✓	Google Sites (at sites.google.com) is a free page creator site run by 
(who else?) Google. The layout isn’t completely customizable.
	
✓	Homestead (at www.homestead.com) is for small businesses and lets 
you start from more than 2,000 business templates.
	
✓	Moogo (at www.moogo.com) shows ads on your site.
	
✓	Moonfruit (at www.moonfruit.com) is a British page creation site that 
helps you connect to Facebook and Twitter.
	
✓	uCoz (at www.ucoz.com) hosts Web sites for free, and lets you include 
photos, videos, photo albums, polls, guest books, and forms that e-mail 
you the information that people fill in. It’s one of the most popular sites 
in Russia.
	
✓	Viviti (at www.viviti.com) is free for one small, personal Web site, 
and a modest fee for larger or commercial sites. You can include Twitter 
messages, Google maps, and other fancy components on your pages.
	
✓	Weebly (at www.weebly.com) has a nice drag-and-drop system for 
setting up your site — and no ads.
	
✓	Webs (at www.webs.com) has lots of design templates and can host 
photos, videos, blogs, and message forums.
	
✓	Wix (at www.wix.com) hosts Flash-based sites — animated, graphics-
based sites that can have fancier formatting than most of the other sites. 
If you’re more of a word person, look elsewhere.
	
✓	Yola (at www.yola.com) used to be SynthaSite. It’s another well-
regarded page creator site.
All these sites make it incredibly easy to make your own Web site — for free. (Of 
course, you have to decide what to say — see the sidebar “What do you say?”)

 Chapter 20: Making Your Own Web Site
Setting up your site
To give you an idea of how easily you can use these page creator sites, try 
Weebly, a free site with lots of nice features. You can set up one Web page or 
a set of pages, including text, pictures, and links to other pages. Your Web site 
is then at username.weebly.com, where username is a name you choose. If 
you want to pay for a domain name (described later in this chapter), you can 
register a name that doesn’t include weebly.com in it.
	
At any page creator site, you create an account (usually for free) with a user­
name. Because this username becomes part of your Web address, choose it 
with care. In our example, we make a Web site for the Maiden Vermont 
Women’s Barbershop Chorus of Middlebury Vermont, so the username 
maidenvermont or maidenvt is a good pick. Weebly lets you choose for 
your Web site a name that’s different from your username, but not all page 
creator sites allow it.
In your Web browser, start at www.weebly.com (or the Web site of the page 
creation site of your choice) and sign up to create an account. Be sure to read 
the terms of service to ensure that you know your rights and responsibilities; 
for example, make sure that you (and not they) own anything you post.
After you sign in, you begin to create the site. Weebly asks for a title for the 
Web site and then shows you an empty home page with a basic design, as 
shown in Figure 20-3. Your next steps are to add text and pictures and to 
refine the design.
What do you say?
Creating a Web page is easy. Choosing what to 
put on your page, however, is harder. What is 
the page for? What kind of person do you want 
to see it? Is it for you and your family and friends 
and potential friends across the world, or are 
you advertising your business online?
Consider which information you want the entire 
world to know, because a Web site is poten­
tially visible to absolutely anyone, including 
that guy who has hated you ever since fifth 
grade. If your page is a personal page, don’t 
include your home address or phone number 
unless you want random people who see the 
page potentially calling you up. If it’s a business 
page, include your address, phone number, and 
any other information that potential customers 
might want.
If you put your e-mail address on your Web site, 
you can expect lots more spam because spam­
mers scrape Web sites: Their programs visit 
Web sites looking for text with at-signs (@) in 
it. You can deter these programs somewhat by 
inserting a space on either side of the @ (as in 
internet12 @ gurus.org) or replac­
ing it with the word at (like internet12 at 
gurus.org), although these programs may 
get wise to this trick.

Figure 20-3: 
Create a 
Web site at 
Weebly by 
using only 
your Web 
browser.
	
Editing a page
Each page creator site has its own, nifty way of helping you make your pages. 
Weebly has this set of tabs along the top (as of the fall of 2009):
	
✓	Elements: Add pictures, text, columns, and other items to the page.
	
✓	Designs: Choose the overall color scheme and page layout.
	
✓	Pages: Add more pages or blogs.
	
✓	Settings: Edit the Web site’s title, password, and other options that 
affect the entire site.
First, decide on a format for your entire site. In Weebly, you click the Designs 
tab and choose a likely-looking color scheme and page layout. Don’t worry 
about the text and pictures in the samples that appear — you change those 
elements later. Choose an overall look that you like.
To edit the page, you use the Elements tab, which shows a series of items you 
can put on your page, such as paragraphs of text and pictures. If you click 
Multimedia at the left end of the tab, you see more options, including a photo 
gallery, videos, and Google Maps. Find an item you want to add to your page, 

343
 Chapter 20: Making Your Own Web Site
drag it where you want it, and then add whatever information is missing. For 
text, cut and paste or type the text you want to appear. For pictures, upload 
photos or clip art from your computer. (See the section “Producing Pictures 
for Your Site,” later in this chapter, for how to find or make graphics.)
Spruce up your home page in these ways:
	
✓	Add text. Weebly includes a few paragraph-formatting options among its 
elements — drag one to your page. When you click in the new text area, 
you see a toolbar with buttons for boldface, italics, bullets, font color, 
typeface, type size, and text alignment, just like in a word processor.
	
✓	Add pictures. For icons, clip art, or photos, drag the Picture element to 
the place on your page where you want a picture to appear. Then upload 
the file that contains your picture. If you put the image in the wrong 
place, you can drag it around the page with your mouse.
	
✓	Add links to other pages. You can convert any text or picture into a 
link. Select the text or image with your mouse and click the Link button 
on the editing toolbar. Choose whether you’re linking to a page on your 
own site or to a Web page that’s not in your site or to an e-mail address 
(so that when a visitor clicks the link, her e-mail program opens with 
a new message addressed to that address). You can also upload docu­
ments (like Word documents or PDF files) and link to them.
	
✓	Add other cool stuff. Most page creator sites provide a bunch of other 
items you can add to your pages, such as a calendar, a weather report, a 
Google map, a blog, an MP3 music player, and videos. For example, you 
can include a map to your church’s or club’s meeting location.
	
✓	Edit the HTML. As you make changes to your page, the page creator 
writes the HTML to display the page. If you’re a glutton for punishment, 
or if you want to tweak the look of your page, many sites enable you to 
see and edit the HTML — in Weebly, click the Custom HTML link.
Publishing your first Web page!
When you like the look of your page, click the Publish button to save your 
changes. The system may ask you to confirm the address you’re going to use 
for your site. Now you can look at your new site in your browser! To see your 
site, type sitename.weebly.com (replace sitename with the name you specified) 
into your browser’s address box.
Naturally, you won’t get it right the first time. (We never do.) You can go back 
to Weebly.com, make changes, and publish again until you like the way the 
site looks.

344
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
One page is not enough
One Web page is rarely enough. How about an About Us page or a Links page 
with the names and links to related Web sites?
To add more pages in Weebly, click the Pages tab (shown in Figure 20-4) and 
then click the New Page link. Give the page a name and decide whether a link 
to it should appear on your site’s navigation bar (the main series of links, 
which may appear along the top of the page or down one side, depending on 
your page layout).
	
Figure 20-4: 
Adding 
pages in 
Weebly. 
	
Be sure to create links among your pages so that your visitors have a way to 
see them (without requiring them to guess the page names and type them as 
part of the Web address).
Producing Pictures for Your Site
Most Web pages contain graphics of some sort. Each picture that appears on 
a Web page is stored in a separate file. To add an image to a Web page, you 
add an HTML tag (command) — or your page creator site’s equivalent — 
to indicate where it should appear, along with a caption for the visually 
impaired, and positioning information (whether you want the pictures to 
the left, center, or right and whether text should flow around it).

345
 Chapter 20: Making Your Own Web Site
Where do pictures come from? You can draw them by using a paint program, 
scan in photographs, or use that fancy digital camera you got for Christmas 
(or your cellphone). Then use Paint or a better graphics editor to crop your 
pictures, fix the red-eye effect, and generally spiff up your pictures. Save your 
files as GIF or JPEG files, and resize them to be fewer than 500 pixels wide and 
smaller than 200KB in file size.
If you need graphics that you can’t produce yourself, you can find lots of 
sources of graphical material:
	
✓	Plenty of freeware, shareware, and commercial clip art are available on 
the Net. Try the Clip Art page at our favorite Web directory, the Open 
Directory Project list, at www.dmoz.org/Computers/Graphics/
Clip_Art.
	
✓	If you see an image you want to use on a Web page, write to the page’s 
owner and ask for permission to use it. More likely than not, the owner 
will let you use the image.
	
✓	You can subscribe to a clip art site. We use clipart.com, which has 
subscriptions starting at $15.
	
Clip art, like any art, is protected by copyright laws. Whether it has already 
been used on a Web page or whether a copyright notice appears on or near 
the image doesn’t matter. It’s all copyrighted. If you use someone else’s 
copyrighted art, you must get permission to do so. Whether your use is edu­
cational, personal, or noncommercial is irrelevant. If you fail to secure permis­
sion, you run the risk of anything from receiving a crabby phone call from 
the owner’s lawyer to winding up on the losing end of a lawsuit.Most people 
are quite reasonable whenever you ask for permission to use their work. If an 
image you want to use doesn’t already come with permission to use it, check 
with the owner before you decide to add it to your own Web page.
Linking to Other Pages and Sites
The hyper in hypertext is the thing that makes the Web so cool. A hyperlink 
(or just link) is the thing on the page that lets you go from page to page by just 
clicking the link. A Web page is hardly a page if it doesn’t link somewhere else.
The immense richness of the Web comes from the links that Web page authors 
place on their pages. Contribute to this richness by including links to places 
you know of that the people who visit your page may also be interested in. 
Try to avoid including links to places that everyone already knows about and 

346
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
has in their bookmarks. For example, everyone knows where to find Google 
and Yahoo!, so leave them off. If your home page mentions your interest in 
one of your hobbies, however, such as canoeing or volleyball or birding or 
your alma mater, include some links to related sites you know of that are 
interesting.
Creating a Web Site with 
Your Bare Hands
If you’re an old-fashioned person, or just someone who likes to get your 
hands dirty (bits and bytes can be particularly hard to wash off), you can use 
the time-honored tools or our Web-site-making forebears — Web editors and 
file transfer programs. Making a Web site from scratch gives you full control 
over the layout of the site and enables you to add database-driven or other 
advanced features. Here’s a quick overview of how the process works:
	
1.	Sign up for Web server space.
	
	 Lots of Web hosting companies are out there, ready to charge from $5 
to $20 per month to store your Web pages on their Web servers — 
computers where Web pages live. We’ve used pair.com, dreamhost.
com, ipowerweb.com, and myhosting.com but lots of other good ones 
are out there. Your Internet service provider (ISP) may include Web 
hosting in your Internet service, so you may already have Web server 
space. Your ISP or Web hosting company gives you a server name, 
username, and password so that you can upload your pages to its site.
	
2.	(Optional) Buy a domain name.
	
	 You don’t have to have a domain name (that is, something-or-other.
com or .net or .org or .us) to have a Web site, but it’s classier. Your 
ISP or Web hosting company can help you find out whether the domain 
name you want is already taken (all the good names are long gone) 
and can help you buy it. Domain names cost from $7 to $20 per year, 
although many Web hosts will throw in a domain name if you sign up for 
a year or longer. See the section “Be the Master of Your Domain,” later in 
this chapter.
	
3.	Write some Web pages.
	
	 Start with one page. You can use any text editor or word processor, but 
spiffy Web-page authoring programs designed for this purpose are 
available — and some are free — so you may as well use one. Dreamweaver 
is the most widely used Web editor, but it costs several hundred dollars. 
KompoZer (the successor to the free Nvu, which was the successor to 
the Web editor that was a part of the precursor to Firefox) is an open 

347
 Chapter 20: Making Your Own Web Site
source Web editor that includes a file transfer (FTP) program; you can 
download it from www.kompozer.net.
	
	 Save the pages in files on your computer’s hard drive, using the filename 
extension .htm or .html. You can see how the pages look by opening 
them in your browser and choosing the File➪Open File command (or 
press Ctrl+O and browse to the file).
	
4.	Upload your Web pages to your Web server.
	
	 The rest of your world can’t see Web pages that are stored on your disk.
You have to copy them to your ISP’s or Web hosting company’s Web 
server. You can use an FTP program such as FileZilla (from filezilla-
project.org). Or, your Web editor may have a built-in FTP program 
(KompoZer and Dreamweaver do). Or, if you’re a real he-man — uh,
he-person — you can use the command line FTP program included with 
Windows.
See Building a Web Site For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by David A. Crowder (Wiley)
for a more detailed explanation of how to create a Web site, add pictures, make 
links among your pages and from your pages to other sites, and publicize 
your site.
Content management systems (CMSs) rule!
As Web sites grow large, they become diffi­
cult to maintain. For a Web site to look profes­
sional, or at least not actively embarrassing, all 
its pages should be formatted in the same way 
and should include a consistent set of sitewide 
navigation links so that visitors can find their 
way around. Making pages by hand becomes 
increasingly cumbersome as all these features 
are added. Naturally, some clever person real­
ized that what we needed to help manage large 
Web sites is a computer program!
A content management system (or CMS) is a 
program that creates Web pages for you. You 
configure the CMS with all the formatting your 
pages will use, including links, menus, colors, 
graphics — you name it. The CMS stores this 
information in a database. Then you create 
Web pages for your site, usually by cutting and 
pasting text into CMS-generated Web forms — 
the CMS stores all content from your pages in 
its database, too. As you complete each page 
and click Publish (or an equivalent link), the 
CMS creates the Web page and stores it on 
your Web server for the public to see.
Many CMS programs are available, but you 
need to have your own Web server space and 
know how to install programs in order to use 
one. Search for list of content management 
systems at www.wikipedia.com to see a 
page that includes tables of CMS software with 
features and pricing. All CMSs have quirks and 
peculiarities that can take a while to figure out, 
so if you have a friend who’s already familiar 
with a CMS, use the same one and share the 
wisdom.

Be the Master of Your Domain
A home page address like this one:
www.people.stratford-upon-avon-internet.com/~shakespeare/
PrinceOfDenmark/index.html
just doesn’t attract as many visitors as
www.hamlet.org
Getting your own domain name is a lot easier and cheaper than you might 
think. Follow these three steps:
	
1.	Choose a name.
	
	 Pick one that’s easy to remember and to spell. Pick out a couple of alter­
native names in case the one you want is taken. Don’t use a variation 
of a popular trademark like Coke or Sony (or For Dummies) unless you 
like dealing with lawyers. Also be sure that the name isn’t already taken; 
whoever you pick to register your domain will have a lookup service to 
see what’s available.
	
2.	Ask your ISP or Web hosting company to host your name.
	
	 Hosting your name means that your ISP or Web hosting company (wher­
ever you store your Web pages — perhaps a wiki farm or page creator 
site) breathes some incantations that tell the Internet where to go when 
someone types your Web address. Many ISPs charge a fee for this ser­
vice, but a few do it for free. Your ISP may be able to handle the next 
step, registration, for you too.
	
3.	Register your name if your ISP doesn’t.
	
	 Hundreds of registrars compete for business in the popular .com, .net, 
.org, .biz, .us, and .info categories. The going rate is between $7 
and $20 per year unless your Web host offers a package that includes it.
	
	 If your ISP wants to charge you big bucks (more than $10 a month) to 
register your name and host your pages, consider using a Web hosting 
service. Pair Networks at pair.com and MyHosting at myhosting.com 
are both reputable, reliable, and cheap.

 Chapter 20: Making Your Own Web Site
Shout It Out: Getting Your 
Web Site Found
After your pages are online, you may want to get people to come and visit. 
Before you create any online publicity, make sure that your pages have two 
types of information that search engines and Web directories look for:
	
✓	Page description: You can store a one-sentence description of your 
page in the metatags (hidden codes) at the beginning of each Web page. 
Yahoo!, Google, Bing, and other sites display this text when your page 
appears in their listings, and they use the text to determine how to cat­
egorize the page.
	
✓	Keywords: You can provide a list of key words and phrases that people 
might search for if they want to find your page. Display the HTML codes 
that make up your page, and skim down until you find </head>. Just 
above that, add a tag like this one:
<meta content=”chickens, hens, eggs, poultry, domestic poultry”
 name=”keywords”>
	
	Replace the list of chicken-related terms with your own. These words 
don’t appear on the page; they are part of the metainformation stored 
about your page. Keep your list reasonably short or else search engines 
will ignore it.
After your page description and keywords are in place, upload your pages again.
To publicize your site, visit your favorite Web directories and search engines, 
such as Google (google.com), Yahoo! (yahoo.com), and Bing (bing.com), 
and submit your URL (the address of your page) to add to their databases. 
All these sites have on their home pages an option for adding a new page — 
the option is usually labeled Suggest URL or Suggest a Site or Add Your Site. 
(Sometimes it’s a teeny link near the bottom of the page.) Automated indexes, 
such as Google, add pages promptly, but manually maintained directories, 
such as the Open Directory Project, may not accept them.
	
Don’t pay to have your site included: Every respectable search engine and 
directory has an option for adding your noncommercial site for free, although 
it make take a while for your site to show up.

350
Part V: Putting Your Own Stuff on the Net 
Getting lots of traffic to your site takes time. If your site offers something 
different that’s of real interest to other folks, it can build a following of its 
own. Even we For Dummies authors have gotten into the action: A few of our 
homegrown sites are Margy’s Great Tapes for Kids site (at www.greattapes.
com), John’s Airline Information On-Line on the Internet site (at airinfo.
travel), and Arnold Reinhold’s Math in the Movies page (at www.math
inthemovies.com). Just imagine what you can come up with!

osh, using the Internet is exciting. But sometimes things get so fouled 
up that you want to push your computer out the window and go back 
to the communication methods our ancestors used, like newspapers, tele­
phones, and smoke signals.
Don’t give up just yet. This chapter offers up some common problems that 
many Internet users encounter, as well as some solutions to those problems.
My PC Takes Forever to Boot and Pop-Up 
Ads Have Taken Over the Screen
Slow start-up, sluggish operation, and annoying pop-ups all suggest that 
your computer is infested with malware, sneaky programs that do bad things 
to your computer, including spyware (which arrives by way of your Web 
browser), viruses (which arrive by e-mail) and worms (which arrive all by 
themselves). A full-scale war is being waged in cyberspace for control of the 
world’s PCs, and your computer is likely a casualty. Chapter 2 describes both 

354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
types of malware, Chapter 4 suggests strongly that you install virus-checker 
and antispyware programs, and Chapter 14 describes how to configure your 
virus checker. Make sure that you have downloaded the latest improvements 
to your Windows operating system, and ensure that your virus checker and 
spyware removers are up to date. And, if you still use Internet Explorer to 
browse the Web, consider trying a different browser, such as Firefox.
We like these antispyware programs, all three of which we use:
	
✓	Ad-aware, from Lavasoft, at www.lavasoftusa.com (shareware)
	
✓	Microsoft Windows Defender, at www.microsoft.com/athome/
security/spyware/software (free, already included in Windows 7 
and Vista)
	
✓	Spybot Search & Destroy, from www.safer-networking.org 
(shareware)
For all three programs, download, install, and run them, and be sure to 
download updates regularly.
The nuclear option
If you have installed and run antivirus and antispyware programs and you 
still have problems, it may be too late for Band-Aid remedies. Your computer 
may be so thoroughly infested that you have no choice but to blow everything 
away and start over.
	
Before you reinstall Windows, you must get a firewall to protect your com­
puter. Most distributed versions of Windows are so insecure that you simply 
cannot install the program and all its security updates before you’re rein­
fected with viruses and worms. (Installing and updating Windows and your 
application programs take a couple of hours. Infection takes perhaps ten 
seconds.) The routers we mention in Chapter 5 that let you connect several 
computers to your Internet connection include adequate firewalls that are 
quite cheap. Even if you have only one computer, the $30 you spend for a 
router is well worth it.
Before you can reinstall Windows, be sure to make a copy of all your files. If 
you haven’t been backing up regularly, make two copies, just to be safe. Back 
up at least one copy to more reliable CD-Rs or DVD-Rs rather than to rewrit­
able media. Make sure that you have the installation CD or DVDs and all the 
registration codes, license codes, and key codes for all applications you use.

355
 Chapter 21: Ten Problems and Ten Solutions
Before reinstalling Windows, you may want to get a copy of Windows For 
Dummies (written by Andy Rathbone and published by Wiley) or Windows 
XP Home Edition: The Complete Reference, or Windows Vista: The Complete 
Reference. (The latter two books were written by John and Margy and — 
published by Osborne/McGraw-Hill.) These books contain more details about 
how to reinstall Windows than we have room for here. You need the original 
CDs that came with your computer or a new copy of Windows XP or later. 
Put the Windows CD or DVD in your CD or DVD drive and reboot. Follow 
the instructions to where it asks whether you want to rewrite or destroy all 
information on your hard drive. To find it, you may need to select advanced 
options. Take a deep breath and answer Yes and then Yes again to all warn­
ings indicating that all your files will be erased. They will — that’s why we 
have you back them up — but they’ll erase the worms, too.
When the reinstallation of Windows is complete, follow the onscreen instruc­
tion to reenter your Internet settings. Then go immediately to windowsup
date.microsoft.com (which works only with Internet Explorer — sigh) 
and download all suggested updates to Windows, which takes quite a while. 
Load your antivirus and antispyware software and get their latest updates. 
Then reinstall all your applications. Yes, this process is a real pain.
Next, place your data backup CD in the CD drive and have your antivirus 
program scan it. We recommend that you do not reinstall all your data files at 
first; just the ones you need to use. If you made two copies as we told you to, 
keep them in two different places — preferably, in two different buildings.
Finally, create separate, password-protected accounts for everyone who 
will use the computer, and make them all Limited rather than Administrator 
accounts unless they have a good reason to be installing their own programs. 
Have a talk with everyone about the risks of free downloads and online game 
sites. Suggest that, in case you have to repeat this process, their use of your 
computer will be terminated. This isn’t the kind of problem you want to keep 
dealing with, as you have no doubt concluded if you just had to rebuild your 
system.
The thermonuclear option
Because you can buy a reasonable computer for less than $400 these days 
and you can use the same printer and screen (if your computer isn’t a laptop) 
you have now, sometimes if you’ve had your old computer for a while, it’s 
easier to buy a new computer and start over. The nice people at the com­
puter store should be able to help you extract your files from your old, 

356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
messed-up computer, perhaps for a modest extra charge, and install them 
on a new one. Even if the new computer is all configured and updated at the 
store, which it should be, you still should get a router to deter future hostile 
invasions.
The switcheroo
Plan B is to consider getting an Apple Macintosh computer, even if only for 
your e-mail and Web surfing. As of this writing, no serious online threats exist 
for Apple’s Mac OS X. This situation could change, but at least Apple has a 
head start over the hackers, rather than the other way around for Microsoft. 
You should still keep your Mac’s operating system up to date and rebuild 
your PC if you still plan to use it. If you need certain programs for work, look 
for Mac equivalents or check out Boot Camp (www.apple.com/macosx/
compatibility), which lets you run your Windows system and programs 
on your Mac.
This Nice, Free Program Doesn’t 
Run If I Turn Off the Ads
Lots of free programs are supported by advertising. That’s the deal. You 
may be able to find equivalent programs that don’t show ads, or you can pay 
to register the program and make the ads go away. Even if you’re willing to 
trade ad-watching for free software, we do not recommend that you use any 
program that shows Web-based ads — adware — while other programs are 
running. (Ads displayed in the program itself rather than in your browser, 
such as the Eudora mail program and Opera Web browser, are fine.) Adware 
companies swear up and down that it’s not spyware and that they don’t com­
pile personal dossiers of all the Web sites you visit to decide which ads to 
send to your computer, but we don’t trust them.
I Can’t Send Large E-Mail Attachments
Some Internet service providers and some system administrators limit the 
size of files you can send or receive by using their mail servers. In the case of 
problems at work, the solution may be as simple as talking to the person in 
charge of your Internet access and asking for the limit to be changed. Your 
ISP might not be so accommodating.
We have other ways to move giant files from point A to point B.

357
 Chapter 21: Ten Problems and Ten Solutions
One is to open an account on a webmail provider that handles large attach­
ments. Google Gmail allows attachments of as much as 25MB, Yahoo Mail 
allows 10MB for the free version and 20MB for the paid Plus version, and 
Windows Live Hotmail allows 10MB. The process of attaching a file to a 
message increases its size by about 20 percent, so the maximum file size is 
smaller than the maximum attachment size.
For local file transfers, sneakernet (transferring files by walking them from 
one computer to another) has made a comeback in the form of USB flash 
drives. Flash drives work with recent versions of all major operating systems. 
They operate like removable disk drives but are about the size of your thumb 
(or smaller, especially if you have big thumbs) and have a shiny, rectangular 
plug at one end. Some geeks carry one on a lanyard around their necks or on 
their keychains. To use one, just plug it into a USB port on your computer. 
For very large files (many gigabytes), you can use an iPod as a portable 
USB hard drive. After you copy whatever files you want, you need to tell 
your operating system that you’re done with the drive before you unplug it. 
Windows uses a tiny icon in the system tray that does this. On Macs, drag the 
disk’s icon to the trash.
If your computer has a CD or DVD writer, you can also burn your files on a CD 
or DVD to give to your friend. It’s not as cute and compact as a USB drive, but 
it’s more durable. Your camera’s memory card can also hold files.
I’m Worried about ID Theft
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov/idtheft) offers this 
advice to prevent identity theft: First, look out for phishing, e-mail that claims 
to come from a bank or another online account, such as eBay, and claims 
that your account has a problem that you can clean up by clicking a link in 
the message. These messages are never real, but they’re very dangerous. If 
your bank thinks that a security problem exists, it doesn’t tell you by e-mail. 
If you’re not sure, contact the company by phone or type its Web address 
(for example, www.yourbank.com) into your browser by hand and look for 
the customer service section. See Chapter 2 for more about phishing.
The Internet isn’t the only source of information about you. Keep bills and 
other documents that bear your account and Social Security numbers in a 
safe place, and tear up or shred old bank statements and credit card bills. 
Get a shredder that cross-cuts the paper into short strips rather than the 
cheaper shredders that make strips the length of the page; patient thieves 
can paste those together. Those offers for preapproved credit cards are also 
dangerous if they fall into the wrong hands. Shred them or stop them alto­
gether by calling 1-888-5OPTOUT or visiting www.optoutprescreen.com. 
If your driver’s license still has your Social Security number on it, get a new 
license issued.

358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Get in the habit of looking over your bank and credit card statements when 
they arrive (or even earlier, online). Don’t worry about the bank’s arithmetic, 
but look for charges that you don’t remember incurring. If you find any, con­
tact your bank or credit card company immediately. After you verify any fraud­
ulent charges, tell the bank that you want new accounts with new credit card 
numbers. You may need to file a police report, although in our experience, if 
you have fraudulent charges, the bank will issue new cards without hassle.
I Can’t Remember All My 
Web Site Passwords
The standard advice is to construct passwords from a mixture of let­
ters, numbers, and special symbols; to have a different password for each 
account; to never write down passwords; and to change them every few 
months. Most Internet users who have dozens of accounts ignore this advice 
because only a truly unusual person can remember dozens of different 
random passwords and which account goes with each on.
We suggest a compromise. Make up one good password to use on all your 
low-risk accounts — accounts in which letting someone else gain access has 
little consequence, such as online newspaper subscriptions. Use different 
passwords for the accounts that really matter, such as online banking. If you 
feel that it’s necessary, writing down those passwords and keeping them in a 
safe place is better than picking a password that’s easy for someone to guess. 
Don’t list your passwords in your desktop Rolodex or on a sticky note stuck 
to your computer’s monitor. Never, ever choose a password that is a regular 
English word (a word that appears in a dictionary) or a common name.
Another option is to store your passwords in a password-protected file. 
The free, open source KeePass program (available for download from www.
keepass.info) enables you to create an entry for each Web site or other 
password you need to remember. You can enter a username, a password, 
a Web address (URL), and notes about the account, and you can organize 
accounts into categories (for example, Home Banking, Email and Chat, and 
Shopping). KeePass can also suggest very strong passwords for you (made of 
random strings of characters) and can copy a username and password into 
your computer’s Clipboard for pasting into your browser. Of course, you need 
to remember the password to your KeePass file — don’t write it anywhere!
Some decent programs are available for safely storing passwords on smart­
phones and the iPod touch, too. We like the free, open-source Keyring for 
Palm smartphones, available at gnukeyring.sourceforge.net. Be sure to 
pick an extremely strong master password and have a backup plan for when 
your phone falls into the bathtub and dies. (Ink on paper has stood the test 
of time.)

I Get Messages Telling Me That E-Mail 
I Never Sent Is Undeliverable
You can’t do much about this problem after it has happened. Most spammers 
use computers that have been taken over by worms or viruses to send spam, 
using faked return addresses taken from the list of spam addresses. Make 
sure that your computer isn’t the source of this type of unwanted message by 
keeping its operating system and antivirus software up to date, using a router 
as your firewall (see Chapter 5), and turning off the computer (or at least its 
connection to the Internet) when it’s not in use.
People Seem to Know a Lot about Me
The rate at which we’re all losing our privacy scares us, too. Here are a few tips.
Get rid of spyware that may 
be lurking on your machine
Spyware does just what it sounds like — it spies on you and your activities. 
You think your Internet activities are private, but unless you keep your PC spy­
ware free, they’re not. Browse one mortgage lender site and you’ll hear from 
the universe of mortgage lenders. Buy from one pharmacy and you’ll receive 
solicitations from other companies for drugs you didn’t even know existed. 
Your inbox is full of names that closely resemble — but aren’t quite — people 
you actually know. If all this sounds familiar, chances are good that software is 
recording your every keystroke. Get rid of it! (The software, not the keyboard.) 
When we use Internet Explorer (some folks still have Web sites that work only 
with Internet Explorer), we often have to clean our machines because worms 
and viruses often sneak through security holes in it. Because it’s so widely 
used, it’s targeted by hackers all over the world, which is why we use Firefox 
or Google Chrome instead (see Chapter 6).
Don’t be dumb
Don’t put information on your Web page that you don’t want everyone in the 
world to know. In particular, don’t include your home address and phone 
number unless you want calls and visits. We know at least one person who 
received an unexpected phone call from someone she met on the Net and 
wasn’t too pleased about it. Why would Net users need this information, 
anyway? They can send you e-mail!

360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Don’t order stuff while using a public PC
Normally, ordering stuff over the Web or by e-mail is safe — at least as safe 
as handing your credit card to a waiter! However, some shopping sites store 
information about you (including a link to your mailing address and payment 
info) on your computer in a file known as a cookie. This system works per­
fectly when you’re ordering from your own computer — you don’t have to 
retype all that info when you visit the site the next time you order. But when 
you order stuff at the library or at a cybercafé, this personal information may 
be stored on that computer. The next person who uses that computer and 
goes to that site then has all your personal data available and may be able to 
use it to place an order. Better not chance it.
I Can’t Get My Kids, Spouse, or Significant 
Other Off the Computer
Games and instant messaging are highly addictive and seem to be becoming 
more so. Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer brags about the addictive nature of the 
games his company sells and smiles as he says he wouldn’t let his kid play 
them. That ought to give you a hint.
Set clear limits on computer usage and stick to them. Have a talk with your 
spouse or significant other about which kinds of online chatting are okay and 
which aren’t. Also think about how much time you spend in front of a com­
puter screen. Use some of your Internet time to make a list of outside activi­
ties you enjoy and stick it next to your computer screen. Promise yourself 
you’ll do at least one fun off-computer activity every day. Internet addiction 
is serious — you may need professional help to quit the habit.
On the other hand, if it’s your spouse, sometimes it makes more sense to 
squander $400 on a second computer (see Chapter 5 for hints on connecting 
them both to the Net using a single account) than to squander your marriage.
When I Click a Link, My Browser 
Says “404 Page Not Found”
Web pages move about or disappear on the Internet. If you type a URL from a 
printed source, make sure that you type it exactly as it was printed, including 
capitalization. If you read a URL that’s part of a sentence, watch out for the 

361
 Chapter 21: Ten Problems and Ten Solutions
comma, period, or hyphen at the end. That comma, period, or hyphen may or 
may not be part of the URL — or it may be punctuation for the sentence.
If you clicked a hypertext link or you’re sure that you typed the URL correctly 
and you still see this error message, the data on the site may have been reor­
ganized. Try “walking up” the URL by deleting the portion back to the last 
slash character and trying again; then delete the portion back to the next-to-
last slash character; and so on.
If you see a File Not Found message when you try entering this line, for 
example:
epicurious.com/cooking/menus/cooknow/omelettes.html
try entering these lines, in order:
epicurious.com/cooking/menus/cooknow
epicurious.com/cooking/menus
epicurious.com/cooking
At one of these levels, you may find a hint about where the file you seek can 
be found. Alternatively, go to your favorite search engine and search for it.
A page long gone may still be found on the Wayback Machine at www.
archive.org, a free site that has attempted the daunting task of periodi­
cally saving snapshots of the whole World Wide Web.
I Want to Include My E-Mail 
Address on My Web Page
Including your e-mail address in a Web page is a sure way to attract spam. 
Spammers have programs that crawl the Web looking for e-mail addresses 
to spam. You can thwart them by describing your e-mail address rather than 
just typing it out — “It’s al at blahblah.com” — or use obscure HTML 
coding on the Web page. At the least, we suggest that you set up a separate 
e-mail address for your Web site at a free webmail site, such as www.gmail.
com, www.hotmail.com, or mail.yahoo.com. If the flood of unwanted mail 
becomes too great, you can abandon that account and set up a new one.
One useful trick is to ask Web site visitors to include a special word in the 
subject line of their messages. For example, if your Web page is about belt 
buckle collecting, you can ask correspondents to include buckles in the sub­
ject line. You can send the rest of the messages to the trash.

Ten Fun or Worthwhile Things 
You Can Do Online
In This Chapter
▶	Taking film-free pictures for family and friends
▶	Checking out short movies and TV advertisements
▶	Finding out the value of stuff you might want to sell
▶	Playing games and touring the solar system
▶	Taking a look at art museums around the globe
▶	Looking for a cure for cancer
▶	Helping poor people around the world
▶	Changing children’s lives
You can use the Internet in hundreds of ways for work and profit. In this 
chapter, we focus on some of the fun you can have out there. If you’d 
like to spend your time online doing something more worthwhile — we’re 
sure you do! — the Internet also offers ways to make the world a better place, 
by working directly on projects or making it possible for other people to do 
so. When you find other ways to improve the world or other new and fun 
things to do on the Net, let us know by sending us an e-mail at internet12@
gurus.org.
Share Pictures and Videos with 
Your Friends and Family
E-mail attachments (see Chapter 15) are an excellent way to ship snapshots 
anywhere in the world for free. You don’t even need a digital camera; your 
phone can probably take sttgills and maybe even video.

364
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If you have more than one or two pictures or videos and you want to share 
them with more than one or two people, making an online photo album is a 
more convenient way to go. Make an account at Flickr (at www.flickr.com) 
or Photobucket (at www.photobucket.com), upload your photo and video 
files, and tell the site who else can see it. You can point your friends to your 
album by giving them the URL, and they can view the pictures online. Some 
of the sites listed in the section “Say Cheese!” in Chapter 18 can also sell your 
friends prints of the ones they especially like.
Entertain Yourself with TV and Radio
There are more and more ways to entertain yourself online than these days 
than ever before, and the day when you don’t need a TV or a stereo is at 
hand. Here are just a few of the things you can find to kill some time.
Watch movies, TV, and ads
The Internet has created a new way for makers of short and experimental 
movies to find an audience. Many sites feature miniflicks that you can watch 
for free. The most popular is Google’s YouTube at youtube.com, whose users 
upload vast amounts of video, from the profound to the inane. Try looking for 
airplane landings. You can upload your own videos, too, as long as you made 
them yourself, they’re no more than ten minutes long, and they follow other 
YouTube guidelines.
Hulu, at www.hulu.com, puts television on the Web, so you can watch early 
episodes of shows that you tuned in partway through. It’s supported by ABC, 
Fox, NBC, and others, so you get the real shows, not chopped-up captures of 
shows, although shows are prefaced with advertisements because something 
or someone has to pay the bills. Blip.tv (at blip.tv — no .com at the end) 
hosts shows you may never have heard of because they’re made by 
independent creators.
	
The entire original 1960s Star Trek series is available on YouTube, complete 
and without ads. Visit www.youtube.com and search for Star Trek.
If for some reason you don’t see as many ads on TV as you want, visit www.
advertisementave.com, where you can catch up on all the ads you’ve 
missed. The excellent AdCritic (creativity-online.com/adcritic) also 
features the best current ads and classics. Either way, now you can catch 
those great Super Bowl ads without having to watch the tedious football.

 Chapter 22: Ten Fun or Worthwhile Things You Can Do Online
These film sites mainly use Flash, which plays videos directly in your Web 
browser. See Chapter 9 to find out how to watch videos on the Web.
Listen to current and classic 
radio programs
Have you ever turned on your radio, found yourself in the middle of a fas­
cinating story, and wished you could have heard the beginning? National 
Public Radio in the United States keeps many of its past programs avail­
able online. If you want to hear the whole program, visit www.npr.org. 
You can also use the site’s search feature to browse for stories you missed 
completely. Some radio shows also have their own Web sites, like Car Talk 
(shown in Figure 22-1).
	
Figure 22-1: 
The Car Talk 
podcast 
offers 
advice 
about cars 
any time you 
need it.
	
Many NPR affiliates and other radio stations have live streaming audio of 
their programs, so you can listen live to stations all over the country — go 
to Google and search for the station call letters or the program name. (John 
recommends his local station at wrvo.fm, especially the old shows from 
the 1930s through 1950s, which they play in the evening.) Many other radio 
stations now let you listen to their live programs over the Internet, which is 
particularly handy in large office buildings with poor radio reception. You 
can listen to stations from around the world and get a taste of world music 
firsthand or hear the news from different perspectives.

366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If you have an iPod or another MP3 player, you can download audio files and 
listen to many radio shows at any time. See Chapter 9 to find out how to 
subscribe to podcasts.
Find Out What Your Stuff Is Worth
You already know about eBay, the online auction site where you can buy and 
sell almost anything. (If not, flip back to Chapter 10 to read about it.) But you 
may not know that you can use it to find out the value of almost anything — 
at least, anything that has sold on eBay in the last 90 days — by searching 
completed eBay auctions.
You need an eBay account to search completed auctions, so start at www.
ebay.com and register for a free account if you don’t already have one. Then 
click the Advanced Search link (we can’t tell you exactly where it is, since 
Web site designs change so often, but it’s probably next to the search box or 
the Search button). Type key words about your priceless treasure into the 
search box and select the Completed Listings check box. When you click the 
Search button, you see all the auctions with those keywords, and what the 
final selling price was. If any of the merchandise is similar to your fabulous 
object, you can see what people are actually paying for it.
(Warning to all you Beanie baby speculators: You may be depressed to 
find out what vintage, rare, one-of-a-kind, limited-edition, collectible Beanie 
Babies are selling for.)
Have Some Fun and Play Games
There are too many sites with games and puzzles to list here, so we had to go 
with a select number of the fun places to visit online.
Play checkers or bridge
. . . Or chess, poker, hearts, backgammon, cribbage, go, or any other board 
game or card game. The classic games hold up well against the ever-more-
bloody electronic games. Now you don’t need to round up live friends to play 
with — you can find willing partners at any time, day or night, at sites such as 
games.yahoo.com or games.aol.com. If you used to play Diplomacy, our 
favorite board game, back in the 1970s, try www.playdiplomacy.com.

367
 Chapter 22: Ten Fun or Worthwhile Things You Can Do Online
True bridge aficionados like to think of bridge not as a card game but, rather, 
as a way of life. You can round up a bridge foursome at www.bridgebase.com 
(for free) and www.okbridge.com ($99 per year after a free trial period). 
Many free and fee sites are listed at www.greatbridgelinks.com.
See Chapter 17 for more elaborate games for one, two, four, or thousands.
Build your own world
Virtual worlds are electronic places you can visit on the Web — kind of like 3D 
chat rooms. Rather than create a screen name, you create a personal action 
figure, or avatar, that walks, talks, and emotes (but doesn’t make a mess on 
your floor). When you’re in one of these worlds, your avatar interacts with 
the avatars of other people who are logged on in surroundings that range 
from quite realistic to truly fantastic. In some virtual worlds, you can even 
build your own places: a room, a house, a park, a city — whatever you can 
imagine. Other worlds let you make money, gain status, and battle complete 
strangers. People who enjoy role-playing games can disappear into online 
games for hours, days, or months at a time.
Most virtual worlds require you to download a plug-in or special software. 
Some are free, whereas others require a monthly or an annual subscription. 
See Chapter 17 for some virtual worlds to consider. For example, Second Life, 
at secondlife.com, lets you create your own part of a shared online world, 
including spending real-world money.
Web-based online worlds are an outgrowth of MUDs (which stands for Multi-
User Dimensions or Multi-User Dungeons or various other names, depending 
on whom you ask), which were text-based virtual online worlds long before 
there was a Web.
Build Your Own Jumbo Jet
Even staid corporate sites have the occasional goodies tucked away. Airbus 
builds airplanes, including the very, very, very large A380 superjumbo. 
Normally, an A380 lists for $300 million, but if that’s a little out of your price 
range, Airbus Goodies has some paper versions you can print, cut out, fold, 
and fly, at www.airbus.com/en/myairbus/goodies.

Visit Art Museums around the World
Art museums are great places to spend a rainy afternoon. Now you can visit 
museums and galleries all over the world by using your browser. Not all 
museum Web sites have online artwork, but many do. Our favorites include 
the Louvre in Paris (www.louvre.fr, click English in the upper right corner 
if you don’t read French), Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts (www.mfa.org), 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (www.metmuseum.org), 
the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam (www.rijksmuseum.nl), and the State 
Hermitage Museum in Russia (www.hermitagemuseum.org). Check out 
the spectacular color photographs from Tsarist Russia by Sergei Prokudin-
Gorskii, digitally reconstructed by the Library of Congress, at www.loc.gov/
exhibits/empire, and the amazing American Memory collection of 
historical photos at memory.loc.gov (shown in Figure 22-2).

Take a Trip around the 
Planet and the Stars
The Internet offers many wonderful simulations of activities such as flight 
and space travel. So if you’ve ever wanted to be a pilot or an astronaut but 
lacked the time or the money to commit, here’s a few places to take a look at.

369
 Chapter 22: Ten Fun or Worthwhile Things You Can Do Online
Tour the earth
The modestly named Google Earth at earth.google.com is a download­
able program that lets you fly around the earth and zoom in and out. After 
you get fairly close to the ground, you find links to pictures contributed by 
users (including some impressively remote places — try looking for South 
Georgia), Wikipedia links, and enough to keep you busy for hours, days, or 
even months, if you’re not careful.
Or, check out Google Maps Street View: Start at maps.google.com, go to 
an urban area (try 1 5th Ave, NY NY 10011), and click Street View. You can 
make a 360-degree pan of that spot to see what it looked like the last time a 
Google employee was there with a camera.
Lots of other interesting maps are on the Web. Watch the “walmartization” of 
the United States at projects.flowingdata.com/walmart. A wonderful 
analysis of the red-state-versus-blue-state political landscape is at www.
personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008.
Tour the solar system
The last half of the 20th century will go down in history as the time when 
humans began to explore outer space. Probes visited several comets and 
asteroids and every planet except Pluto. The probes sent back amazing 
pictures: storms on Jupiter, oceans on Europa, mudslides on Mars, and the 
Earth at night.
Which generation will get to play tourist in the solar system remains to be 
seen; here are some great space sites:
	
✓	You can follow the adventures of the Mars rovers at marsrovers.jpl.
nasa.gov, and virtual tours are available now at sites such as sse.
jpl.nasa.gov.
	
✓	Be sure to bookmark the astronomy picture of the day at apod.nasa.

Do Some Cool Things with Books Online 
No longer must you carry around that hardback bunch of paper with words 
printed in ink. No. Today you can find references online, help turn print 
books into digital ones, and even go check out some comics.
Edit an encyclopedia
Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org) is not only a free encyclopedia, it also 
lets you edit its articles. If you feel knowledgeable about a topic, look it up 
in Wikipedia. If you find mistakes or have more to say, just set up a free 
account, then click the Edit tab. If no article exists, Wikipedia offers to let you 
create one. Read en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents/Editing_
Wikipedia for more information on how to edit existing articles and write new 
ones, following the rules of Neutral Point of View. See the section “Working 
Together on a Wiki” in Chapter 20 for more about how groups can edit a Web 
site communally using a wiki.
Digitize old books
Many Web sites require that you decode some blurry text known as a 
CAPTCHA (which allegedly stands for Completely Automated Public Turing 
test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) before it will let you set up 
an account or post a message. The reCAPTCHA project at Carnegie-Mellon 
University uses CAPTCHAs to help digitize old books and newspapers. The scan­
ning process first makes a photographic image of each page, then tries to iden­
tify the words in the text. It can recognize most of the words but some are just 
too blurry or obscure for automatic identification. That’s where you come in. 
Each reCAPTCHA challenge shows you two words (see Figure 22-3); one that’s 
already been decoded and one that hasn’t. When you type in the two words, it

Search for Extraterrestrial Life 
or Cure Cancer
SETI@home (setiweb.ssl.berkeley.edu) is a scientific experiment that 
uses Internet-connected home and office computers to search for extrater­
restrial intelligence (SETI). The idea is to have thousands of otherwise idle 
PCs and Macs perform the massive calculations needed to extract the radio 
signals of other civilizations from intergalactic noise. You can participate by 
running a free program that downloads and analyzes data collected at the 
Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico.
If eavesdropping on space aliens seems a bit far out, you may enjoy lending 
your computer’s idle time to solving problems in cryptography and mathe­
matics. Distributed.net (www.distributed.net) manages several projects. 
(Feel free to join the Internet Gurus team there.) When you sign up to help 
a project at Distributed.net, you agree to run its program on your computer 
when the computer isn’t otherwise occupied, and your donation of computer 
time helps achieve the goal of the project.

By signing up to run its program, you’re helping with basic research that may 
help find a cure for “Alzheimer’s, Mad Cow (BSE), CJD, ALS, Huntington’s, 
Parkinson’s disease, and many cancers and cancer-related syndromes.”

sites that list special children in need of homes: www.rainbowkids.com and 
www.capbook.org. It can’t hurt to look.
