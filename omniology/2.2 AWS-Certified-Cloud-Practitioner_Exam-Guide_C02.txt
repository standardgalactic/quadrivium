Introduction 
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam is intended for individuals who can effectively 
demonstrate overall knowledge of the AWS Cloud, independent of a specific job role.  
The exam validates a candidate’s ability to complete the following tasks: 
•

• 
Understand and explain the AWS shared responsibility model 
• 
Understand security best practices 
• 
Understand AWS Cloud costs, economics, and billing practices 
• 
Describe and position the core AWS services, including compute, network, database, and storage 
services 
• 
Identify AWS services for common use cases 
Target candidate description 
The target candidate has up to 6 months of exposure to AWS Cloud design, implementation, and/or 
operations. This certification is ideal for candidates who are from non-IT backgrounds. These candidates 
might be in the early stages of pursuing an AWS Cloud career or might work with people in AWS Cloud 
roles. 
Recommended AWS knowledge 
The target candidate should have knowledge in the following areas: 
• 
AWS Cloud concepts 
• 
Security and compliance in the AWS Cloud 
• 
Core AWS services 
• 
Economics of the AWS Cloud 
What is considered out of scope for the target candidate? 
The following is a non-exhaustive list of related job tasks that the target candidate is not expected to be 
able to perform. These items are considered out of scope for the exam: 
• 
Coding 
• 
Cloud architecture design 
• 
Troubleshooting  
• 
Implementation  
• 
Load and performance testing 
To view a detailed list of specific tools and technologies that might be covered on the exam, in addition to 
lists of in-scope AWS services and out-of-scope AWS services, refer to the Appendix.

Exam content 
Response types 
There are two types of questions on the exam:  
• 
Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors) 
• 
Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options 
Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or 
incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose. 
Distractors are generally plausible responses that match the content area. 
Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes 50 
questions that will affect your score. 
Unscored content 
The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about 
candidate performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these questions for future use as scored 
questions. These unscored questions are not identified on the exam.  
Exam results 
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam is a pass or fail exam. The exam is scored against a 
minimum standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification industry best practices and 
guidelines.  
Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum passing score is 700. 
Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether you passed. Scaled scoring 
models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels.  
Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. This 
information is intended to provide general feedback about your exam performance. The exam uses a 
compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each 
section. You need to pass only the overall exam. 
Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than other 
sections have. The table contains general information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use 
caution when interpreting section-level feedback.  
Content outline 
This exam guide includes weightings, test domains, and task statements for the exam. This guide is not a 
comprehensive listing of the content on the exam. However, additional context for each of the task 
statements is available to help guide your preparation for the exam. The following table lists the main 
content domains and their weightings. The table precedes the complete exam content outline, which 
includes the additional context. The percentage in each domain represents only scored content.
