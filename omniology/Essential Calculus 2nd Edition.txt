PREFACE
This book is a response to those instructors who feel that calculus textbooks are too
big. In writing the book I asked myself: What is essential for a three-semester calcu-
lus course for scientists and engineers?
The book is about two-thirds the size of my other calculus books (Calculus, Seventh
Edition and Calculus, Early Transcendentals, Seventh Edition) and yet it contains
almost all of the same topics. I have achieved relative brevity mainly by condensing
the exposition and by putting some of the features on the website www.stewartcal-
culus.com. Here, in more detail are some of the ways I have reduced the bulk:
■
I have organized topics in an efﬁcient way and rewritten some sections
with briefer exposition.
■
The design saves space. In particular, chapter opening spreads and photo-
graphs have been eliminated.
■
The number of examples is slightly reduced. Additional examples are 
provided online.
■
The number of exercises is somewhat reduced, though most instructors 
will ﬁnd that there are plenty. In addition, instructors have access to the
archived problems on the website.
■
Although I think projects can be a very valuable experience for students, 
I have removed them from the book and placed them on the website.
■
A discussion of the principles of problem solving and a collection of
challenging problems for each chapter have been moved to the website.
Despite the reduced size of the book, there is still a modern ﬂavor: Conceptual
understanding and technology are not neglected, though they are not as prominent as
in my other books.
ALTERNATE VERSIONS
I have written several other calculus textbooks that might be preferable for some
instructors. Most of them also come in single variable and multivariable versions.
■
Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Second Edition, is similar to the
present textbook except that the exponential, logarithmic, and inverse trigo-
nometric functions are covered earlier than in the present book.
■
Calculus, Seventh Edition, has more complete coverage of calculus than the
present book, with somewhat more examples and exercises.
■
Calculus, Seventh Edition, Hybrid Version, is similar to Calculus, Seventh
Edition, in content and coverage except that all of the end-of-section exer-
cises are available only in Enhanced WebAssign. The printed text includes
all end-of-chapter review material.
■
Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Seventh Edition, is similar to Calculus,
Seventh Edition, except that the exponential, logarithmic, and inverse 
trigonometric functions are covered earlier. It is also available in a 
Hybrid Version.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

■
Calculus: Concepts and Contexts, Fourth Edition, emphasizes conceptual
understanding. The coverage of topics is not encyclopedic and the material on
transcendental functions and on parametric equations is woven throughout the
book instead of being treated in separate chapters. It is also available in a
Hybrid Version.
■
Calculus: Early Vectors introduces vectors and vector functions in the ﬁrst
semester and integrates them throughout the book. It is suitable for students
taking Engineering and Physics courses concurrently with calculus.
■
Brief Applied Calculus is intended for students in business, the social sciences,
and the life sciences. It is also available in a Hybrid Version.
WHAT’S NEW IN THE SECOND EDITION?
The changes have resulted from talking with my colleagues and students at the Uni-
versity of Toronto and from reading journals, as well as suggestions from users and
reviewers. Here are some of the many improvements that I’ve incorporated into this
edition: 
■
At the beginning of the book there are four diagnostic tests, in Basic Algebra, 
Analytic Geometry, Functions, and Trigonometry. Answers are given and students
who don’t do well are referred to where they should seek help (Appendixes,
review sections of Chapter 1, and the website).
■
Section 7.5 (Area of a Surface of Revolution) is new. I had asked reviewers if
there was any topic missing from the ﬁrst edition that they regarded as essential.
This was the only topic that was mentioned by more than one reviewer.
■
Some material has been rewritten for greater clarity or for better motivation. See,
for instance, the introduction to maximum and minimum values on pages 145–46
and the introduction to series on page 442.
■
New examples have been added (see Example 4 on page 731 for instance). And
the solutions to some of the existing examples have been ampliﬁed. A case in
point: I added details to the solution of Example 1.4.9 because when I taught
Section 1.4 from the ﬁrst edition I realized that students need more guidance
when setting up inequalities for the Squeeze Theorem.
■
The data in examples and exercises have been updated to be more timely.
■
Several new historical margin notes have been added.
■
About 40% of the exercises are new. Here are some of my favorites: 1.6.43,
2.2.13–14, 2.5.59, 2.6.39–40, 3.3.52, 4.3.44–45, 7.6.24, 8.2.29–30, 8.7.67–68,
10.1.38, 10.4.43–44
■
The animations in Tools for Enriching Calculus (TEC) have been completely
redesigned and are accessible in Enhanced WebAssign, CourseMate, and 
PowerLecture. Selected Visuals and Modules are available at 
www.stewartcalculus.com.
CONTENT
DIAGNOSTIC TESTS ■The book begins with four diagnostic tests, in Basic Algebra,
Analytic Geometry, Functions, and Trigonometry.
CHAPTER 1 ■FUNCTIONS AND LIMITS After a brief review of the basic functions,
limits and continuity are introduced, including limits of trigonometric functions, lim-
its involving inﬁnity, and precise deﬁnitions.

CHAPTER 2 ■DERIVATIVES The material on derivatives is covered in two sections in
order to give students time to get used to the idea of a derivative as a function. The
formulas for the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions are derived in the section
on basic differentiation formulas. Exercises explore the meanings of derivatives in
various contexts.
CHAPTER 3 
■APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION The basic facts concerning
extreme values and shapes of curves are deduced from the Mean Value Theorem. The
section on curve sketching includes a brief treatment of graphing with technology. The
section on optimization problems contains a brief discussion of applications to busi-
ness and economics.
CHAPTER 4 ■INTEGRALS The area problem and the distance problem serve to moti-
vate the deﬁnite integral, with sigma notation introduced as needed. (Full coverage of
sigma notation is provided in Appendix B.) A quite general deﬁnition of the deﬁnite
integral (with unequal subintervals) is given initially before regular partitions are
employed. Emphasis is placed on explaining the meanings of integrals in various con-
texts and on estimating their values from graphs and tables.
CHAPTER 5 ■INVERSE FUNCTIONS: EXPONENTIAL, LOGARITHMIC, AND INVERSE TRIGONO-
METRIC FUNCTIONS The logarithm is deﬁned as an integral and the exponential func-
tion as its inverse. Applications to exponential growth and decay follow. Inverse
trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions are also covered here. L’Hospital’s
Rule is included in this chapter because limits of transcendental functions so often
require it.
CHAPTER 6 ■TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION All the standard methods are covered,
as well as computer algebra systems, numerical methods, and improper integrals.
CHAPTER 7 ■APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION General methods are emphasized.
The goal is for students to be able to divide a quantity into small pieces, estimate with
Riemann sums, and recognize the limit as an integral. The chapter concludes with an
introduction to differential equations, including separable equations and direction
ﬁelds.
CHAPTER 8 ■SERIES The convergence tests have intuitive justiﬁcations as well as
formal proofs. The emphasis is on Taylor series and polynomials and their applica-
tions to physics. Error estimates include those based on Taylor’s Formula (with
Lagrange’s form of the remainder term) and those from graphing devices.
CHAPTER 9 ■PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS AND POLAR COORDINATES This chapter
introduces parametric and polar curves and applies the methods of calculus to them.
A brief treatment of conic sections in polar coordinates prepares the way for Kepler’s
Laws in Chapter 10. 
CHAPTER 10 ■VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE In addition to the material
on vectors, dot and cross products, lines, planes, and surfaces, this chapter covers vector-
valued functions, length and curvature of space curves, and velocity and acceleration
along space curves, culminating in Kepler’s laws.
CHAPTER 11 ■PARTIAL DERIVATIVES In view of the fact that many students have dif-
ﬁculty forming mental pictures of the concepts of this chapter, I’ve placed a special
emphasis on graphics to elucidate such ideas as graphs, contour maps, directional
derivatives, gradients, and Lagrange multipliers.

A Companion to Calculus
By Dennis Ebersole, Doris Schattschneider, Alicia Sevilla, 
and Kay Somers
ISBN 0-495-01124-X
Written to improve algebra and problem-solving skills of stu-
dents taking a calculus course, every chapter in this companion
is keyed to a calculus topic, providing conceptual background
and speciﬁc algebra techniques needed to understand and solve
calculus problems related to that topic. It is designed for calcu-
lus courses that integrate the review of precalculus concepts or
for individual use. 
Linear Algebra for Calculus
By Konrad J. Heuvers, William P. Francis, John H. Kuisti,
Deborah F. Lockhart, Daniel S. Moak, and Gene M. Ortner
ISBN 0-534-25248-6
This comprehensive book, designed to supplement the calculus
course, provides an introduction to and review of the basic
ideas of linear algebra.

Reading a calculus textbook is different from reading a 
newspaper or a novel, or even a physics book. Don’t be dis-
couraged if you have to read a passage more than once in
order to understand it. You should have pencil and paper and
calculator at hand to sketch a diagram or make a calculation.
Some students start by trying their homework problems
and read the text only if they get stuck on an exercise. I sug-
gest that a far better plan is to read and understand a section
of the text before attempting the exercises. In particular, you
should look at the deﬁnitions to see the exact meanings of
the terms. And before you read each example, I suggest that
you cover up the solution and try solving the problem your-
self. You’ll get a lot more from looking at the solution if you
do so.
Part of the aim of this course is to train you to think logi-
cally. Learn to write the solutions of the exercises in a con-
nected, step-by-step fashion with explanatory sentences—
not just a string of disconnected equations or formulas.
The answers to the odd-numbered exercises appear at the
back of the book, in Appendix D. Some exercises ask for a
verbal explanation or interpretation or description. In such
cases there is no single correct way of expressing the
answer, so don’t worry that you haven’t found the deﬁnitive
answer. In addition, there are often several different forms in
which to express a numerical or algebraic answer, so if your
answer differs from mine, don’t immediately assume you’re
wrong. For example, if the answer given in the back of the
book is 
and you obtain 
, then you’re
right and rationalizing the denominator will show that the
answers are equivalent.
The icon ; indicates an exercise that deﬁnitely requires 
the use of either a graphing calculator or a computer with
graphing software. (The use of these graphing devices and
some of the pitfalls that you may encounter are discussed on
stewartcalculus.com. Go to Additional Topics and click on
Graphing Calculators and Computers.) But that doesn’t
mean that graphing devices can’t be used to check your
work on the other exercises as well. The symbol 
is
reserved for problems in which the full resources of a com-
puter algebra system (like Derive, Maple, Mathematica, or
the TI-89/92) are required.
You will also encounter the symbol |, which warns you
against committing an error. I have placed this symbol in the
margin in situations where I have observed that a large pro-
portion of my students tend to make the same mistake.

TO THE STUDENT

Tools for Enriching Calculus, which is a companion to
this text, is referred to by means of the symbol 
and
can be accessed in Enhanced WebAssign and CourseMate
(selected Visuals and Modules are available at www.stewart-
calculus.com). It directs you to modules in which you can
explore aspects of calculus for which the computer is partic-
ularly useful.
There is a lot of useful information on the website
stewartcalculus.com. There you will ﬁnd a review of pre-
calculus topics (in case your algebraic skills are rusty), as
well as Homework Hints (see the following paragraph),
Additional Examples (see below), Challenge Problems,
Projects, Lies My Calculator and Computer Told Me,
(explaining why calculators sometimes give the wrong
answer), Additional Topics, and links to outside resources.
Homework Hints for representative exercises are indi-
cated by printing the exercise number in blue: 5. These hints
can be found on stewartcalculus.com as well as Enhanced
WebAssign and CourseMate. The homework hints ask you
questions that allow you to make progress toward a solution
without actually giving you the answer. You need to pursue
each hint in an active manner with pencil and paper to work
out the details. If a particular hint doesn’t enable you to
solve the problem, you can click to reveal the next hint.
You will see margin notes in some sections directing 
you to Additional Examples on the website. You will also 
see the symbol 
beside two or three of the examples in
every section of the text. This means that there are videos 
(in Enhanced WebAssign and CourseMate) of instructors
explaining those examples in greater detail.
I recommend that you keep this book for reference pur-
poses after you ﬁnish the course. Because you will likely
forget some of the speciﬁc details of calculus, the book will
serve as a useful reminder when you need to use calculus in
subsequent courses. And, because this book contains more
material than can be covered in any one course, it can also
serve as a valuable resource for a working scientist or 
engineer.
Calculus is an exciting subject, justly considered to be
one of the greatest achievements of the human intellect. I
hope you will discover that it is not only useful but also
intrinsically beautiful.

1.1
FUNCTIONS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIONS
Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another. Consider the following
four situations.
A. The area 
of a circle depends on the radius of the circle. The rule that connects
and 
is given by the equation 
. With each positive number 
there is
associated one value of , and we say that 
is a function of .
B. The human population of the world 
depends on the time . The table gives esti-
mates of the world population 
at time 
for certain years. For instance,
But for each value of the time there is a corresponding value of 
and we say that
is a function of .
C. The cost 
of mailing an envelope depends on its weight . Although there is no
simple formula that connects 
and , the post ofﬁce has a rule for determining
when 
is known.
D. The vertical acceleration of the ground as measured by a seismograph during an
earthquake is a function of the elapsed time Figure 1 shows a graph generated by
seismic activity during the Northridge earthquake that shook Los Angeles in 1994.
For a given value of 
the graph provides a corresponding value of .
Each of these examples describes a rule whereby, given a number ( , , , or ),
another number ( , , , or ) is assigned. In each case we say that the second num-
ber is a function of the ﬁrst number.

FUNCTIONS AND LIMITS
Calculus is fundamentally different from the mathematics that you have studied previously. Calculus 
is less static and more dynamic. It is concerned with change and motion; it deals with quantities that
approach other quantities. So in this first chapter we begin our study of calculus by investigating how
the values of functions change and approach limits.

A function
is a rule that assigns to each element in a set 
exactly one
element, called
, in a set .
We usually consider functions for which the sets 
and 
are sets of real numbers.
The set 
is called the domain of the function. The number
is the value of 
at 
and is read “
of .” The range of 
is the set of all possible values of 
as
varies throughout the domain. A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the
domain of a function 
is called an independent variable. A symbol that represents
a number in the range of 
is called a dependent variable. In Example A, for
instance, 
is the independent variable and 
is the dependent variable.
It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine (see Figure 2). If is in the domain
of the function 
then when 
enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the
machine produces an output 
according to the rule of the function. Thus we can
think of the domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all pos-
sible outputs.
Another way to picture a function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 3. Each
arrow connects an element of 
to an element of . The arrow indicates that 
is
associated with 
is associated with , and so on.
The most common method for visualizing a function is its graph. If 
is a function
with domain , then its graph is the set of ordered pairs
(Notice that these are input-output pairs.) In other words, the graph of consists of all
points 
in the coordinate plane such that 
and is in the domain of .
The graph of a function 
gives us a useful picture of the behavior or “life history”
of a function. Since the -coordinate of any point 
on the graph is 
, we
can read the value of 
from the graph as being the height of the graph above the
point . (See Figure 4.) The graph of 
also allows us to picture the domain of 
on
the -axis and its range on the -axis as in Figure 5.
EXAMPLE 1 The graph of a function 
is shown in Figure 6.
(a) Find the values of 
and 
.
(b) What are the domain and range of ?
SOLUTION
(a) We see from Figure 6 that the point 
lies on the graph of , so the value of
at 1 is 
. (In other words, the point on the graph that lies above 
is
3 units above the x-axis.)
When 
, the graph lies about 0.7 unit below the -axis, so we estimate that

REPRESENTATIONS OF FUNCTIONS
There are four possible ways to represent a function:
■verbally (by a description in words)
■visually (by a graph)
■numerically (by a table of values)
■algebraically (by an explicit formula)
If a single function can be represented in all four ways, it is often useful to go from
one representation to another to gain additional insight into the function. But certain
functions are described more naturally by one method than by another. With this in
mind, let’s reexamine the four situations that we considered at the beginning of this
section.
A. The most useful representation of the area of a circle as a function of its radius 
is probably the algebraic formula 
, though it is possible to compile a
table of values or to sketch a graph (half a parabola). Because a circle has to have
a positive radius, the domain is 
, and the range is also 
.
B. We are given a description of the function in words: 
is the human population
of the world at time . Let’s measure so that 
corresponds to the year 1900.
The table of values of world population provides a convenient representation of this
function. If we plot these values, we get the graph (called a scatter plot) in Figure
7. It too is a useful representation; the graph allows us to absorb all the data at once.
What about a formula? Of course, it’s impossible to devise an explicit formula that
gives the exact human population 
at any time . But it is possible to ﬁnd an
expression for a function that approximates
. In fact, we could use a graphing
calculator with exponential regression capabilities to obtain the approximation
Figure 8 shows that it is a reasonably good “ﬁt.” The function 
is called a mathe-
matical model for population growth. In other words, it is a function with an 
explicit formula that approximates the behavior of our given function. We will see,
however, that the ideas of calculus can be applied to a table of values; an explicit
formula is not necessary.

The function 
is typical of the functions that arise whenever we attempt to
apply calculus to the real world. We start with a verbal description of a function.
Then we may be able to construct a table of values of the function, perhaps from
instrument readings in a scientiﬁc experiment. Even though we don’t have com-
plete knowledge of the values of the function, we will see throughout the book that
it is still possible to perform the operations of calculus on such a function.
C. Again the function is described in words: Let 
be the cost of mailing a large
envelope with weight . The rule that the US Postal Service used as of 2011 is as
follows: The cost is 88 cents for up to one ounce, plus 20 cents for each successive
ounce (or less) up to 13 ounces. The table of values shown in the margin is the most
convenient representation for this function, though it is possible to sketch a graph
(see Example 6).
D. The graph shown in Figure 1 is the most natural representation of the vertical accel-
eration function 
. It’s true that a table of values could be compiled, and it is even
possible to devise an approximate formula. But everything a geologist needs to
know—amplitudes and patterns—can be seen easily from the graph. (The same is
true for the patterns seen in electrocardiograms of heart patients and polygraphs for
lie-detection.)
In the next example we sketch the graph of a function that is deﬁned verbally.
EXAMPLE 2 When you turn on a hot-water faucet, the temperature 
of the water
depends on how long the water has been running. Draw a rough graph of 
as a
function of the time that has elapsed since the faucet was turned on.
SOLUTION The initial temperature of the running water is close to room tempera-
ture because the water has been sitting in the pipes. When the water from the hot-
water tank starts ﬂowing from the faucet, 
increases quickly. In the next phase, 
is constant at the tempera ture of the heated water in the tank. When the tank is
drained, 
decreases to the temperature of the water supply. This enables us to make
the rough sketch of 
as a function of in Figure 9.
■
EXAMPLE 3 Find the domain of each function.
(a) 
(b) 
SOLUTION
(a) Because the square root of a negative number is not deﬁned (as a real number),
the domain of 
consists of all values of such that 
. This is equivalent to
, so the domain is the interval 
.
(b) Since
and division by 
is not allowed, we see that 
is not deﬁned when 
or
. Thus the domain of is 
, which could also be written in
interval notation as 
.
■
The graph of a function is a curve in the 
-plane. But the question arises: Which
curves in the 
-plane are graphs of functions? This is answered by the following test.
THE VERTICAL LINE TEST A curve in the 
-plane is the graph of a function of
if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.

SECTION 1.1  FUNCTIONS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIONS
5
The reason for the truth of the Vertical Line Test can be seen in Figure 10. If each
vertical line 
intersects a curve only once, at 
, then exactly one functional
value is deﬁned by 
. But if a line 
intersects the curve twice, at
and 
, then the curve can’t represent a function because a function can’t assign
two different values to .
PIECEWISE DEFINED FUNCTIONS
The functions in the following three examples are deﬁned by different formulas in dif -
ferent parts of their domains.
EXAMPLE 4 A function 
is defined by
Evaluate 
, 
, and 
and sketch the graph.
SOLUTION Remember that a function is a rule. For this particular function the rule
is the following: First look at the value of the input . If it happens that 
, then
the value of 
is 
. On the other hand, if 
, then the value of 
is 
.
How do we draw the graph of ? We observe that if 
, then 
,
so the part of the graph of 
that lies to the left of the vertical line 
must coin-
cide with the line 
, which has slope 
and -intercept 1. If 
, then
, so the part of the graph of 
that lies to the right of the line 
must
coincide with the graph of 
, which is a parabola. This enables us to sketch the
graph in Figure l1. The solid dot indicates that the point 
is included on the
graph; the open dot indicates that the point 
is excluded from the graph.
■
The next example of a piecewise deﬁned function is the absolute value function.
Recall that the absolute value of a number , denoted by 
, is the distance from
to 
on the real number line. Distances are always positive or , so we have

(Remember that if is negative, then 
is positive.)
EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the absolute value function 
.
SOLUTION From the preceding discussion we know that
Using the same method as in Example 4, we see that the graph of 
coincides with
the line 
to the right of the -axis and coincides with the line 
to the
left of the -axis (see Figure 12).
■
EXAMPLE 6 In Example C at the beginning of this section we considered the cost
of mailing a large envelope with weight . In effect, this is a piecewise deﬁned
function because, from the table of values on page 4, we have
The graph is shown in Figure 13. You can see why functions similar to this one are
called step functions—they jump from one value to the next.
■
SYMMETRY
If a function 
satisﬁes 
for every number 
in its domain, then 
is
called an even function. For instance, the function 
is even because
The geometric signiﬁcance of an even function is that its graph is symmetric with
respect to the -axis (see Figure 14). This means that if we have plotted the graph of

A CATALOG OF ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS
In solving calculus problems you will ﬁnd that it is helpful to be familiar with the
graphs of some commonly occurring functions. These same basic functions are often
used to model real-world phenomena, so we begin with a discussion of mathematical
modeling. We also review brieﬂy how to transform these functions by shifting, stretch-
ing, and reﬂecting their graphs as well as how to combine pairs of functions by the
standard arithmetic operations and by composition.
MATHEMATICAL MODELING
A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function
or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the
demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in
a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission
reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps
to make predictions about future behavior.
Figure 1 illustrates the process of mathematical modeling. Given a real-world prob-
lem, our ﬁrst task is to formulate a mathematical model by identifying and naming the
independent and dependent variables and making assumptions that simplify the phe-
nomenon enough to make it mathematically tractable. We use our knowledge of the
physical situation and our mathematical skills to obtain equations that relate the vari-
ables. In situations where there is no physical law to guide us, we may need to collect
data (either from a library or the Internet or by conducting our own experiments) and
examine the data in the form of a table in order to discern patterns. From this numeri -
cal representation of a function we may wish to obtain a graphical representation by
plotting the data. The graph might even suggest a suitable algebraic formula in some
cases.
The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus
that will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that we have
formulated in order to derive mathematical conclusions. Then, in the third stage, we
take those mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the origi-
nal real-world phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions.
The ﬁnal step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the pre-
dictions don’t compare well with reality, we need to reﬁne our model or to formulate
a new model and start the cycle again.
A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical
situation—it is an idealization. A good model simpliﬁes reality enough to permit
mathematical calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions. It
is important to realize the limitations of the model. In the end, Mother Nature has the
ﬁnal say.
There are many different types of functions that can be used to model relationships
observed in the real world. In what follows, we discuss the behavior and graphs

of these functions and give examples of situations appropriately modeled by such
functions.
■Linear Models
When we say that is a linear function of , we mean that the graph of the function
is a line, so we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line to write a for-
mula for the function as
where 
is the slope of the line and 
is the -intercept.
A characteristic feature of linear functions is that they grow at a constant rate. For
instance, Figure 2 shows a graph of the linear function 
and a table of
sample values. Notice that whenever increases by 0.1, the value of 
increases by
0.3. So 
increases three times as fast as . Thus the slope of the graph 
,
namely 3, can be interpreted as the rate of change of with respect to .
EXAMPLE 1
(a) As dry air moves upward, it expands and cools. If the ground temperature is
and the temperature at a height of 1 km is 
, express the temperature 
(in °C) as a function of the height 
(in kilometers), assuming that a linear model is
appropriate.
(b) Draw the graph of the function in part (a). What does the slope represent?
(c) What is the temperature at a height of 2.5 km?
SOLUTION
(a) Because we are assuming that 
is a linear function of , we can write
We are given that 
when 
, so
In other words, the -intercept is 
.
We are also given that 
when 
, so
The slope of the line is therefore

tion is

■Polynomials
A function 
is called a polynomial if
where 
is a nonnegative integer and the numbers 
are constants
called the coefﬁcients of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is
If the leading coefﬁcient 
, then the degree of the polynomial 
is . For example, the function
is a polynomial of degree 6.
A polynomial of degree 1 is of the form 
and so it is a linear func-
tion. A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form 
and is called a
quadratic function. Its graph is always a parabola obtained by shifting the parabola
. The parabola opens upward if 
and downward if 
. (See Figure 4.)
A polynomial of degree 3 is of the form
and is called a cubic function. Figure 5 shows the graph of a cubic function in part
(a) and graphs of polynomials of degrees 4 and 5 in parts (b) and (c). We will see later
why the graphs have these shapes.
Polynomials are commonly used to model various quantities that occur in the nat-
ural and social sciences. For instance, in Chapter 2 we will explain why economists
often use a polynomial 
to represent the cost of producing units of a commodity.

■Power Functions
A function of the form 
, where 
is a constant, is called a power function.
We consider several cases.
(i)
, where n is a positive integer
The graphs of 
for 
, and 
are shown in Figure 6. (These are
polynomials with only one term.) You are familiar with the shape of the graphs of
(a line through the origin with slope 1) and 
(a parabola).
The general shape of the graph of 
depends on whether 
is even or
odd. If 
is even, then 
is an even function and its graph is similar to the
parabola 
. If 
is odd, then 
is an odd function and its graph is simi-
lar to that of 
. Notice from Figure 7, however, that as 
increases, the graph of
becomes ﬂatter near 0 and steeper when 
. (If is small, then 
is
smaller, 
is even smaller, 
is smaller still, and so on.)
(ii)
, where n is a positive integer
The function 
is a root function. For 
it is the square root
function 
, whose domain is 
and whose graph is the upper half of
the parabola 
. [See Figure 8(a).] For other even values of , the graph of
is similar to that of 
. For 
we have the cube root function

whose domain is 
(recall that every real number has a cube root) and
whose graph is shown in Figure 8(b). The graph of 
for 
odd 
is
similar to that of 
.
(iii)
The graph of the reciprocal function
is shown in Figure 9. Its
graph has the equation 
, or 
, and is a hyperbola with the coordinate
axes as its asymptotes. This function arises in physics and chemistry in connection
with Boyle’s Law, which says that, when the temperature is constant, the volume
of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure :
where 
is a constant. Thus the graph of 
as a function of 
has the same general
shape as the right half of Figure 9.
Power functions are also used to model species-area relationships (Exercise 16),
illumination as a function of distance from a light source (Exercise 15), and the peri-
od of revolution of a planet as a function of its distance from the sun (Kepler’s Sec-
ond Law, page 612).
■Rational Functions
A rational function
is a ratio of two polynomials:
where 
and 
are polynomials. The domain consists of all values of 
such that
. A simple example of a rational function is the function 
, whose
domain is 
; this is the reciprocal function graphed in Figure 9. The function
is a rational function with domain 
. Its graph is shown in Figure 10.
■Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometry and the trigonometric functions are reviewed on Reference Page 2 
and also in Appendix A. In calculus the convention is that radian measure is always
used (except when otherwise indicated). For example, when we use the function
, it is understood that 
means the sine of the angle whose radian
measure is . Thus the graphs of the sine and cosine functions are as shown in Fig-
ure 11.

Notice that for both the sine and cosine functions the domain is 
and the
range is the closed interval 
. Thus, for all values of , we have
or, in terms of absolute values,
Also, the zeros of the sine function occur at the integer multiples of ; that is,
An important property of the sine and cosine functions is that they are periodic
functions and have period 
. This means that, for all values of ,
The periodic nature of these functions makes them suitable for modeling repetitive
phenomena such as tides, vibrating springs, and sound waves.
The tangent function is related to the sine and cosine functions by the equation
and its graph is shown in Figure 12. It is undeﬁned whenever

Its range is

The remaining three trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, and cotangent) are 
the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. Their graphs are shown in
Appendix A.
■Exponential Functions and Logarithms
The exponential functions are the functions of the form 
, where the base
is a positive constant. The graphs of 
and 
are shown in Figure 13. In
both cases the domain is 
and the range is 
.
Exponential functions will be studied in detail in Chapter 5, and we will see that
they are useful for modeling many natural phenomena, such as population growth (if
) and radioactive decay (if 
The logarithmic functions
, where the base 
is a positive constant,
are the inverse functions of the exponential functions. They will be studied in Chap-
ter 5. Figure 14 shows the graphs of four logarithmic functions with various bases. 
In each case the domain is 
, the range is 
, and the function increases
slowly when 
.

many functions quickly by hand. It will also enable us to write equations for given
graphs. Let’s ﬁrst consider translations. If

shifted upward a distance of 
units
(because each -coordinate is increased by the same number ). Likewise, if

of 
shifted units to the right.
VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL SHIFTS Suppose

Now let’s consider the stretching and reﬂecting transformations. If 
, then the
graph of 
is the graph of 
stretched by a factor of 
in the vertical 
direction (because each -coordinate is multiplied by the same number ). The graph
of 
is the graph of 
reﬂected about the -axis because the point
is replaced by the point 
. The following chart also incorporates the results
of other stretching, shrinking, and reﬂecting transformations.
VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL STRETCHING, SHRINKING, AND REFLECTING

Figure 16 illustrates these stretching transformations when applied to the cosine
function with

we multi-
ply the -coordinate of each point on the graph of 
by 2. This means that the
graph of 
gets stretched vertically by a factor of 2.

15. Many physical quantities are connected by inverse square
laws, that is, by power functions of the form 
. In
particular, the illumination of an object by a light source is
inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the
source. Suppose that after dark you are in a room with just
one lamp and you are trying to read a book. The light is too
dim and so you move halfway to the lamp. How much
brighter is the light?
16. It makes sense that the larger the area of a region, the larger
the number of species that inhabit the region. Many ecolo-
gists have modeled the species-area relation with a power
function and, in particular, the number of species 
of bats
living in caves in central Mexico has been related to the sur-
face area 
of the caves by the equation 
.
(a) The cave called Misión Imposible near Puebla, Mexico,
has a surface area of

bats would you expect to find in that cave?

estimate the area of the cave.

THE LIMIT OF A FUNCTION
Our aim in this section is to explore the meaning of the limit of a function. We begin
by showing how the idea of a limit arises when we try to ﬁnd the velocity of a falling
ball.
EXAMPLE 1 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of
the CN Tower in Toronto, 450 m above the ground. Find the velocity of the ball
after 5 seconds.
SOLUTION Through experiments carried out four centuries ago, Galileo discovered
that the distance fallen by any freely falling body is proportional to the square of the
time it has been falling. (This model for free fall neglects air resistance.) If the dis-
tance fallen after seconds is denoted by 
and measured in meters, then Galileo’s
law is expressed by the equation
The difﬁculty in ﬁnding the velocity after 5 s is that we are dealing with a single
instant of time 
, so no time interval is involved. However, we can approxi-
mate the desired quantity by computing the average velocity over the brief time
interval of a tenth of a second from 
to 
:
The table shows the results of similar calculations of the average velocity over suc-
cessively smaller time periods. It appears that as we shorten the time period, the
average velocity is becoming closer to 
. The instantaneous velocity when

INTUITIVE DEFINITION OF A LIMIT
Let’s investigate the behavior of the function deﬁned by 
for val-
ues of near 2. The following table gives values of 
for values of close to 2, but
not equal to 2.
From the table and the graph of 
(a parabola) shown in Figure 1 we see that when
is close to 2 (on either side of 2), 
is close to 4. In fact, it appears that we can
make the values of 
as close as we like to 4 by taking sufﬁciently close to 2. We
express this by saying “the limit of the function 
as 
approaches
2 is equal to 4.” The notation for this is
In general, we use the following notation.
DEFINITION Suppose 
is deﬁned when is near the number . (This
means that is deﬁned on some open interval that contains , except possibly
at itself.) Then we write
and say
“the limit of 
, as approaches , equals ”
if we can make the values of 
arbitrarily close to 
(as close to L as we
like) by taking x to be sufﬁciently close to 
(on either side of ) but not 
equal to .
Roughly speaking, this says that the values of 
approach 
as approaches . In
other words, the values of 
tend to get closer and closer to the number 
as 
gets
closer and closer to the number (from either side of ) but 
.
An alternative notation for
is
as    
which is usually read “
approaches 
as approaches .”

The table in the margin shows the results from one calculator; you can see that some-
thing strange seems to be happening.
If you try these calculations on your own calculator you might get different values,
but eventually you will get the value 0 if you make sufﬁciently small. Does this mean
that the answer is really 0 instead of ? No, the value of the limit is , as we will show

culator’s value for

to as many digits as the calculator is capable
of carrying.)
Something similar happens when we try to graph the function
of Example 3 on a graphing calculator or computer. Parts (a) and (b) of Figure 5 show
quite accurate graphs of , and when we use the trace mode (if available) we can esti-
mate easily that the limit is about . But if we zoom in too much, as in parts (c) and (d),
then we get inaccurate graphs, again because of problems with subtraction.

■COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS
Computer algebra systems (CAS) have
commands that compute limits. In order
to avoid the types of pitfalls demon-
strated in Examples 3 and 5, they don’t
ﬁnd limits by numerical experimentation.
Instead, they use more sophisticated
techniques such as computing inﬁnite
series. If you have access to a CAS, use
the limit command to compute the limits
in the examples of this section and to
check your answers in the exercises of
this chapter.
EXAMPLE 4 Guess the value of 
.
SOLUTION The function 
is not deﬁned when 
. Using a cal-
culator (and remembering that, if 
, 
means the sine of the angle whose
radian measure is ), we construct the table of values correct to eight decimal
places. From the table at the left and the graph in Figure 6 we guess that
This guess is in fact correct, as will be proved in the next section using a geometric 
argument.

is undeﬁned at 0. Evaluating the

Examples 3 and 5 illustrate some of the pitfalls in guessing the value of a limit. It
is easy to guess the wrong value if we use inappropriate values of , but it is difﬁcult
to know when to stop calculating values. And, as the discussion after Example 3
shows, sometimes calculators and computers give the wrong values. In the next sec-
tion, however, we will develop foolproof methods for calculating limits.
EXAMPLE 6 The Heaviside function 
is deﬁned by
[This function is named after the electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925)
and can be used to describe an electric current that is switched on at time 
.] Its
graph is shown in Figure 8.
As approaches 0 from the left, 
approaches 0. As approaches 0 from the
right, 
approaches 1. There is no single number that 
approaches as
approaches 0. Therefore 
does not exist.
■
ONE-SIDED LIMITS
We noticed in Example 6 that 
approaches 0 as approaches 0 from the left and
approaches 1 as approaches 0 from the right. We indicate this situation symbol-
ically by writing
and    
The symbol “
” indicates that we consider only values of that are less than 0.
Likewise, “
” indicates that we consider only values of that are greater than 0.
DEFINITION We write
and say the left-hand limit of 
as 
approaches 
[or the limit of 
as
approaches 
from the left] is equal to 
if we can make the values of
arbitrarily close to L by taking x to be sufﬁciently close to a and x less than a.

Notice that Deﬁnition 2 differs from Deﬁnition 1 only in that we require 
to be
less than . Similarly, if we require that 
be greater than , we get “the right-hand
limit of 
as
approaches 
is equal to ” and we write
Thus the symbol “

. These deﬁnitions are
illustrated in Figure 9.
By comparing Deﬁnition l with the deﬁnitions of one-sided limits, we see that the
following is true.

EXAMPLE 8 Find

SOLUTION As becomes close to 0, 
also becomes close to 0, and 
becomes
very large. (See the following table.) In fact, it appears from the graph of the func-
tion 
shown in Figure 11 that the values of

large by taking close enough to 0. Thus the values of 
do not approach a num-
ber, so

PRECISE DEFINITION OF A LIMIT
Deﬁnition 1 is appropriate for an intuitive understanding of limits, but for deeper under-
standing and rigorous proofs we need to be more precise.
We want to express, in a quantitative manner, that 
can be made arbitrarily
close to 
by taking 
to be sufﬁciently close to 
(but 
. This means that 
can be made to lie within any preassigned distance from 
(traditionally denoted by
, the Greek letter epsilon) by requiring that 
be within a speciﬁed distance 
(the
Greek letter delta) from . That is, 
when 
and 
.
Notice that we can stipulate that 
by writing 
. The resulting precise
deﬁnition of a limit is as follows.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function deﬁned on some open interval that con-
tains the number , except possibly at 
itself. Then we say that the limit of
as
approaches
is , and we write
if for every number 
there is a corresponding number 
such that
if    
Deﬁnition 4 is illustrated in Figures 12–14. If a number  
is given, then we
draw the horizontal lines 
and 
and the graph of . (See Fig-
ure 12.) If 
, then we can ﬁnd a number 
such that if we restrict
to lie in the interval 
and take 
, then the curve 
lies

a

It’s important to realize that the process illustrated in Figures 12 and 13 must work
for every positive number , no matter how small it is chosen. Figure 14 shows that if
a smaller 
is chosen, then a smaller 
may be required.
In proving limit statements it may be helpful to think of the deﬁnition of limit as a
challenge. First it challenges you with a number . Then you must be able to produce
a suitable . You have to be able to do this for every

CALCULATING LIMITS
In Section 1.3 we used calculators and graphs to guess the values of limits, but we saw
that such methods don’t always lead to the correct answer. In this section we use the
following properties of limits, called the Limit Laws, to calculate limits.

These ﬁve laws can be stated verbally as follows:
Sum Law
1. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.
Difference Law
2. The limit of a difference is the difference of the limits.
Constant Multiple Law
3. The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the 
function.
Product Law
4. The limit of a product is the product of the limits.
Quotient Law
5. The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of
the denominator is not 0).
It is easy to believe that these properties are true. For instance, if 
is close to 
and 
is close to 
, it is reasonable to conclude that 
is close to 
.
This gives us an intuitive basis for believing that Law 1 is true. All of these laws can
be proved using the precise deﬁnition of a limit. (See Appendix C.)
If we use the Product Law repeatedly with 
, we obtain the following
law.
Power Law
6.
where 
is a positive integer
In applying these six limit laws, we need to use two special limits: 
7.
8.
These limits are obvious from an intuitive point of view (state them in words or
draw graphs of 
and 
), but they can be proved from the precise deﬁnition.
(See Exercises 37 and 38 in Section 1.3.)
If we now put 
in Law 6 and use Law 8, we get another useful special
limit.
9.
where 
is a positive integer
A similar limit holds for roots as follows. 
10.
where 
is a positive integer
(If 
is even, we assume that

More generally, we have the following law.

have gotten the correct answer in Example 1(a) by substituting 5 for x. Similarly,
direct substitution provides the correct answer in part (b). The functions in Example
1 are a polynomial and a rational function, respectively, and similar use of the Limit
Laws proves that direct substitution always works for such functions (see Exercises 57
and 58). We state this fact as follows.
DIRECT SUBSTITUTION PROPERTY If

The trigonometric functions also enjoy the Direct Substitution Property. We know

■NEWTON AND LIMITS
Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day
in 1642, the year of Galileo’s death. When
he entered Cambridge University in 1661
Newton didn’t know much mathematics,
but he learned quickly by reading Euclid
and Descartes and by attending the lectures
of Isaac Barrow. Cambridge was closed
because of the plague in 1665 and 1666,
and Newton returned home to reﬂect on
what he had learned. Those two years were
amazingly productive for at that time he
made four of his major discoveries: (1) his
representa tion of functions as sums of inﬁ-
nite series, including the binomial theorem;
(2) his work on differential and integral cal-
culus; (3) his laws of motion and law of
universal gravitation; and (4) his prism
experi ments on the nature of light and
color. Because of a fear of controversy and
criticism, he was reluctant to publish his
discoveries and it wasn’t until 1687, at the
urging of the astronomer Halley, that New-
ton published Principia Mathematica. In
this work, the greatest scientiﬁc treatise
ever written, Newton set forth his version
of calculus and used it to investigate
mechanics, ﬂuid dynamics, and wave
motion, and to explain the motion of 
planets and comets.
The beginnings of calculus are found in 
the calculations of areas and volumes by
ancient Greek scholars such as Eudoxus
and Archimedes. Although aspects of the
idea of a limit are implicit in their “method
of exhaustion,” Eudoxus and Archimedes
never explicitly formulated the concept of a
limit. Likewise, mathematicians such as
Cavalieri, Fermat, and Barrow, the immedi-
ate precursors of Newton in the develop-
ment of calculus, did not actually use
limits. It was Isaac Newton who was the
ﬁrst to talk explicitly about limits. He
explained that the main idea behind limits
is that quantities “approach nearer than by
any given difference.” Newton stated that
the limit was the basic concept in calculus,
but it was left to later mathe maticians like
Cauchy to clarify his ideas about limits.

functions satisfy the Direct Substitution Property at 0. The addition formulas for cosine
and sine can then be used to deduce that these functions satisfy the Direct Substitution
Property everywhere (see Exercises 59 and 60). In other words, for any real number
,
This enables us to evaluate certain limits quite simply. For example,
Functions with the Direct Substitution Property are called continuous at a and will
be studied in Section 1.5. However, not all limits can be evaluated by direct substitu-
tion, as the following examples show.
EXAMPLE 2 Find 
.
SOLUTION Let 
. We can’t ﬁnd the limit by substituting
because 
isn’t deﬁned. Nor can we apply the Quotient Law, because the
limit of the denominator is 0. Instead, we need to do some preliminary algebra. We
factor the numerator as a difference of squares:
The numerator and denominator have a common factor of 
. When we take the
limit as 
approaches 1, we have 
and so 
. Therefore we can cancel
the common factor and compute the limit as follows:
■
NOTE In Example 2 we were able to compute the limit by replacing the given
function 
by a simpler function, 
, with the same
limit. This is valid because 
except when 
, and in computing a limit
as 
approaches 1 we don’t consider what happens when 
is actually equal to 1. In
general, we have the following useful fact.
, provided the limits exist.

Note that the values of the functions in Examples 2 and 3 are identical except when
(see Figure 2) and so they have the same limit as approaches 1.

EXAMPLE 5 Find 
.
SOLUTION We can’t apply the Quotient Law immediately, since the limit of the
denominator is 0. Here the preliminary algebra consists of rationalizing the 
numerator:
This calculation conﬁrms the guess that we made in Example 3 in Section 1.3.
■
Some limits are best calculated by ﬁrst ﬁnding the left- and right-hand limits. The
following theorem is a reminder of what we discovered in Section 1.3. It says that a
two-sided limit exists if and only if both of the one-sided limits exist and are equal.

When computing one-sided limits, we use the fact that the Limit Laws also hold
for one-sided limits.

Since the right- and left-hand limits are different, it follows from Theorem 2 that
does not exist. The graph of the function 
is shown in
Figure 4 and supports the one-sided limits that we found.

The next two theorems give two additional properties of limits. Their proofs can be
found in Appendix C.
THEOREM If 
when is near 
(except possibly at ) and the
limits of 
and both exist as approaches , then
THE SQUEEZE THEOREM If 
when is near 
(except
possibly at ) and
then
The Squeeze Theorem, which is sometimes called the Sandwich Theorem or the
Pinching Theorem, is illustrated by Figure 6. It says that if 
is squeezed between
and 
near , and if and have the same limit at , then is forced to have
the same limit 
at .
EXAMPLE 9 Show that 
.
SOLUTION First note that we cannot use
because 
does not exist (see Example 5 in Section 1.3).
Instead we apply the Squeeze Theorem, and so we need to ﬁnd a function
smaller than 
and a function 
bigger than such that both
and 
approach 0. To do this we use our knowledge of the sine function. Because
the sine of any number lies between 
and 1, we can write
Any inequality remains true when multiplied by a positive number. We know that
for all and so, multiplying each side of the inequalities in 
by 
, we get
as illustrated by Figure 7. We know that
Taking

In Example 4 in Section 1.3 we made the guess, on the basis of numerical and
graphical evidence, that
We can prove Equation 6 with help from the Squeeze Theorem. Assume ﬁrst that 
lies between 0 and 
. Figure 8(a) shows a sector of a circle with center O, central
angle , and radius 1. BC is drawn perpendicular to OA. By the deﬁnition of radian
measure, we have arc
. Also, 
. From the diagram
we see that
Therefore
so    
Let the tangent lines at 
and 
intersect at . You can see from Figure 8(b) that the 
cir cumference of a circle is smaller than the length of a circumscribed polygon, and
so arc
. Thus
(In Appendix C the inequality 
is proved directly from the deﬁnition of the
length of an arc without resorting to geometric intuition as we did here.) Therefore we
have
and so    
We know that 
and 
, so by the Squeeze Theorem, we
have
But the function 
is an even function, so its right and left limits must be equal.
Hence we have
so we have proved Equation 6.

CHAPTER 1
FUNCTIONS AND LIMITS
1.5
CONTINUITY
We noticed in Section 1.4 that the limit of a function as 
approaches 
can often 
be found simply by calculating the value of the function at . Functions with this 
property are called continuous at a. We will see that the mathematical deﬁnition of
continuity corresponds closely with the meaning of the word continuity in everyday
language. (A continuous process is one that takes place gradually, without interrup-
tion or abrupt change.)
DEFINITION A function 
is continuous at a number a if
Notice that Deﬁnition l implicitly requires three things if 
is continuous at a:
1.
is deﬁned (that is, a is in the domain of )
2.
exists
3.
The deﬁnition says that 
is continuous at if 
approaches 
as approaches
. Thus a continuous function 
has the property that a small change in 
produces
only a small change in 
. In fact, the change in 
can be kept as small as we
please by keeping the change in sufﬁciently small.
If 
is deﬁned near 
(in other words, 
is deﬁned on an open interval containing
, except perhaps at ), we say that 
is discontinuous at a (or 
has a discontinuity
at ) if 
is not continuous at .
Physical phenomena are usually continuous. For instance, the displacement or
velocity of a vehicle varies continuously with time, as does a person’s height. But dis-
continuities do occur in such situations as electric currents. [See Example 6 in Sec-
tion 1.3, where the Heaviside function is discontinuous at because 
does
not exist.]
Geometrically, you can think of a function that is continuous at every number in an
interval as a function whose graph has no break in it. The graph can be drawn with-
out removing your pen from the paper.
EXAMPLE 1 Figure 2 shows the graph of a function f. At which numbers is f dis-
continuous? Why?
SOLUTION It looks as if there is a discontinuity when 
because the graph has a
break there. The ofﬁcial reason that f is discontinuous at 1 is that 
is not deﬁned.
The graph also has a break when 
, but the reason for the discontinuity is
different. Here, 
is deﬁned, but 
does not exist (because the left and
right limits are different). So f is discontinuous at 3.
What about 
? Here, 
is deﬁned and 
exists (because the left
and right limits are the same). But
So 
is discontinuous at 5.
■
Now let’s see how to detect discontinuities when a function is deﬁned by a formula.

EXAMPLE 2 Where are each of the following functions discontinuous?
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
SOLUTION
(a) Notice that 
is not deﬁned, so f is discontinuous at 2. Later we’ll see why
is continuous at all other numbers.
(b) Here 
is deﬁned but
does not exist. (See Example 8 in Section 1.3.) So f is discontinuous at 0.
(c) Here 
is deﬁned and
exists. But 
so 
is not continuous at 2.
(d) The greatest integer function 
has discontinuities at all of the integers
because 
does not exist if 
is an integer. (See Example 8 and Exercise 45
in Section 1.4.)
■
Figure 3 shows the graphs of the functions in Example 2. In each case the graph
can’t be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper because a hole or break or jump
occurs in the graph. The kind of discontinuity illustrated in parts (a) and (c) is called
removable because we could remove the discontinuity by redeﬁning 
at just the 
single number 2. [The function 
is continuous.] The discontinuity in part
(b) is called an inﬁnite discontinuity. The discontinuities in part (d) are called jump
discontinuities because the function “jumps” from one value to another.

Instead of always using Deﬁnitions 1, 2, and 3 to verify the continuity of a func-
tion as we did in Example 4, it is often convenient to use the next theorem, which
shows how to build up complicated continuous functions from simple ones.
THEOREM If 
and are continuous at 
and is a constant, then the
following functions are also continuous at :
1.
2.

PROOF Each of the ﬁve parts of this theorem follows from the corresponding Limit
Law in Section 1.4. For instance, we give the proof of part 1. Since 
and are con-
tinuous at , we have
Therefore
(by Law 1)
This shows that 
is continuous at .
It follows from Theorem 4 and Deﬁnition 3 that if 
and 
are continuous on an
interval, then so are the functions 
, and (if 
is never 0) 
. The
following theorem was stated in Section 1.4 as the Direct Substitution Property.
THEOREM
(a) Any polynomial is continuous everywhere; that is, it is continuous on
.
(b) Any rational function is continuous wherever it is deﬁned; that is, it is
continuous on its domain.
PROOF
(a) A polynomial is a function of the form
where 
are constants. We know that
(by Law 7)
and
(by 9)
This equation is precisely the statement that the function 
is a continuous 
function. Thus, by part 3 of Theorem 4, the function 
is continuous. Since

is a sum of functions of this form and a constant function, it follows from part 1
of Theorem 4 that 
is continuous.
(b) A rational function is a function of the form
where 
and 
are polynomials. The domain of 
is 
. We
know from part (a) that 
and 
are continuous everywhere. Thus, by part 5 of The-
orem 4, 
is continuous at every number in .
As an illustration of Theorem 5, observe that the volume of a sphere varies contin-
uously with its radius because the formula 
shows that 
is a polynomial
function of . Likewise, if a ball is thrown vertically into the air with a velocity of
50 fts, then the height of the ball in feet 
seconds later is given by the formula
. Again this is a polynomial function, so the height is a continuous
function of the elapsed time.
Knowledge of which functions are continuous enables us to evaluate some limits
very quickly, as the following example shows. Compare it with Example 1(b) in Sec-
tion 1.4.
EXAMPLE 5 Find 
.
SOLUTION The function
is rational, so by Theorem 5 it is continuous on its domain, which is 
. 
Therefore
■
It turns out that most of the familiar functions are continuous at every number in
their domains. For instance, Limit Law 10 (page 36) is exactly the statement that root
functions are continuous.
From the appearance of the graphs of the sine and cosine functions (Figure 11 in
Section 1.2), we would certainly guess that they are continuous. And in Section 1.4
we showed that
In other words, the sine and cosine functions are continuous everywhere. It follows
from part 5 of Theorem 4 that
is continuous except where cos

tiple of

and so on (see Figure 5).

THEOREM The following types of functions are continuous at every 
number in their domains: polynomials, rational functions, root functions,
trigonometric functions
EXAMPLE 6 On what intervals is each function continuous?
(a) 
(b)
(c)
SOLUTION 
(a) 
is a polynomial, so it is continuous on 
by Theorem 5(a).
(b) 
is a rational function, so by Theorem 5(b) it is continuous on its domain,
which is 
. Thus is continuous on the inter-
vals 
, 
, and 
.
(c) We can write 
, where
is continuous on 
by Theorem 6. 
is a rational function, so it is continuous
everywhere except when 
, that is, 
. 
is also a rational function, but
its denominator is never 0, so 
is continuous everywhere. Thus, by parts 1 and 2 of
Theorem 4, 
is continuous on the intervals 
and 
.
■
Another way of combining continuous functions 
and to get a new continuous
function is to form the composite function 
. This fact is a consequence of the fol-
lowing theorem.
THEOREM If

and 
then
In other words,
Intuitively, Theorem 7 is reasonable because if is close to , then 
is close to
, and since 
is continuous at , if 
is close to , then 
is close to 
. A
proof of Theorem 7 is given in Appendix C.
THEOREM If is continuous at 
and 
is continuous at 
, then the
composite function 
given by 
is continuous at .
This theorem is often expressed informally by saying “a continuous function of a
continuous function is a continuous function.”

bol if the function is continuous and the
limit exists. In other words, the order of
these two symbols can be reversed.

Since 
is continuous at 
, we can apply Theorem 7 to obtain
which is precisely the statement that the function 
is continuous at ;
that is, 
is continuous at .

SOLUTION
(a) We have

Now is continuous on 
since it is a polynomial, and 
is also continuous every-
where by Theorem 6. Thus 
is continuous on 
by Theorem 8.
(b) Notice that 
can be broken up as the composition of four continuous functions:
or    
where
We know that each of these functions is continuous on its domain (by Theorems 5
and 6), so by Theorem 8, 
is continuous on its domain, which is
■
An important property of continuous functions is expressed by the following theo-
rem, whose proof is found in more advanced books on calculus.
THE INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREM Suppose that 
is continuous on
the closed interval 
and let 
be any number between 
and 
,
where 
. Then there exists a number in 
such that 
.
The Intermediate Value Theorem states that a continuous function takes on every
intermediate value between the function values 
and 
. It is illustrated by Fig-
ure 6. Note that the value 
can be taken on once [as in part (a)] or more than once
[as in part (b)].

If we think of a continuous function as a function whose graph has no hole or
break, then it is easy to believe that the Intermediate Value Theorem is true. In geo-
metric terms it says that if any horizontal line 
is given between 
and
as in Fig ure 7, then the graph of 
can’t jump over the line. It must intersect
somewhere.
It is important that the function 
in Theorem 9 be continuous. The Intermediate
Value Theorem is not true in general for discontinuous functions (see Exercise 36).
One use of the Intermediate Value Theorem is in locating roots of equations as in
the following example.
EXAMPLE 8 Show that there is a root of the equation
between 1 and 2.
SOLUTION Let 
. We are looking for a solution of the
given equation, that is, a number between 1 and 2 such that 
. Therefore
we take 
, 
, and 
in Theorem 9. We have
and
Thus 
; that is, 
is a number between 
and 
. Now 
is
continuous since it is a polynomial, so the Intermediate Value Theorem says there 
is a number between 1 and 2 such that 
. In other words, the equation
has at least one root in the interval 
.
In fact, we can locate a root more precisely by using the Intermediate Value 
Theorem again. Since
a root must lie between 1.2 and 1.3. A calculator gives, by trial and error,
so a root lies in the interval 
.
■
We can use a graphing calculator or computer to illustrate the use of the Interme-
diate Value Theorem in Example 8. Figure 8 shows the graph of 
in the viewing rect-
angle 
by 
and you can see that the graph crosses the -axis between 1
and 2. Fig ure 9 shows the result of zooming in to the viewing rectangle 
by

In fact, the Intermediate Value Theorem plays a role in the very way these graph-
ing devices work. A computer calculates a ﬁnite number of points on the graph and
turns on the pixels that contain these calculated points. It assumes that the function is
continuous and takes on all the intermediate values between two consecutive points.
The computer therefore connects the pixels by turning on the intermediate pixels.

LIMITS INVOLVING INFINITY
In this section we investigate the global behavior of functions and, in particular,
whether their graphs approach asymptotes, vertical or horizontal.
INFINITE LIMITS
In Example 8 in Section 1.3 we concluded that
does not exist
by observing, from the table of values and the graph of 
in Figure 1, that the
values of 
can be made arbitrarily large by taking 
close enough to 0. Thus the
values of 
do not approach a number, so 
does not exist.
To indicate this kind of behavior we use the notation
| This does not mean that we are regarding 
as a number. Nor does it mean that the
limit exists. It simply expresses the particular way in which the limit does not exist:
can be made as large as we like by taking close enough to 0.
In general, we write symbolically
to indicate that the values of 
become larger and larger (or “increase without
bound”) as approaches .

DEFINITION The notation
means that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily large (as large as we
please) by taking sufﬁciently close to (on either side of ) but not equal to .
Another notation for 
is
as    
Again, the symbol 
is not a number, but the expression 
is often read
as
“the limit of 
, as approaches , is inﬁnity”
or
“
becomes inﬁnite as approaches ”
or
“
increases without bound as approaches ”
This deﬁnition is illustrated graphically in Figure 2.
Similarly, as shown in Figure 3,
means that the values of 
are as large negative as we like for all values of 
that
are sufﬁciently close to , but not equal to .
The symbol 
can be read as “the limit of 
, as 
approaches
, is negative inﬁnity” or “
decreases without bound as 
approaches .” As an
example we have
Similar deﬁnitions can be given for the one-sided inﬁnite limits
remembering that “
” means that we consider only values of that are less than
, and similarly “
” means that we consider only 
. Illustrations of these
four cases are given in Figure 4.

CHAPTER 1
FUNCTIONS AND LIMITS
DEFINITION The line 
is called a vertical asymptote of the curve
if at least one of the following statements is true:
For instance, the -axis is a vertical asymptote of the curve 
because
. In Figure 4 the line 
is a vertical asymptote in each of the 
four cases shown.
EXAMPLE 1 Find 
and 
.
SOLUTION If is close to 3 but larger than 3, then the denominator 
is a
small positive number and 
is close to 6. So the quotient 
is a large
positive number. Thus, intuitively, we see that
Likewise, if is close to 3 but smaller than 3, then 
is a small negative number
but 
is still a positive number (close to 6). So 
is a numerically large
negative number. Thus
The graph of the curve 
is given in Figure 5. The line 
is a
vertical asymptote.
■
EXAMPLE 2 Find the vertical asymptotes of 
.
SOLUTION Because
there are potential vertical asymptotes where 
. In fact, since 
as 
and 
as 
, whereas 
is positive (and not
near 0) when x is near 
, we have
and    
This shows that the line 
is a vertical asymptote. Similar reasoning shows 
that the lines 
, where n is an integer, are all vertical asymptotes of
. The graph in Figure 6 conﬁrms this.

LIMITS AT INFINITY
In computing inﬁnite limits, we let 
approach a number and the result was that the
values of became arbitrarily large (positive or negative). Here we let become arbi-
trarily large (positive or negative) and see what happens to .

Let’s begin by investigating the behavior of the function 
deﬁned by
as 
becomes large. The table at the left gives values of this function correct to six 
decimal places, and the graph of 
has been drawn by a computer in Figure 7.
As grows larger and larger you can see that the values of 
get closer and clos-
er to 1. In fact, it seems that we can make the values of 
as close as we like to 1
by taking sufﬁciently large. This situation is expressed symbolically by writing
In general, we use the notation
to indicate that the values of 
approach 
as becomes larger and larger.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function deﬁned on some interval 
. Then
means that the values of 
can be made as close to 
as we like by taking
sufﬁciently large.
Another notation for 
is
as  
The symbol 
does not represent a number. Nonetheless, the expression
is often read as 
“the limit of 
, as approaches inﬁnity, is ”
or
“the limit of 
, as becomes inﬁnite, is ”
or
“the limit of 
, as increases without bound, is ”
The meaning of such phrases is given by Deﬁnition 3. A more precise deﬁnition, sim-
ilar to the 
deﬁnition of Section 1.3, is given at the end of this section.

Geometric illustrations of Deﬁnition 3 are shown in Figure 8. Notice that there are
many ways for the graph of 
to approach the line 
(which is called a horizon-
tal asymptote) as we look to the far right of each graph.
Referring back to Figure 7, we see that for numerically large negative values of ,
the values of 
are close to 1. By letting 
decrease through negative values with-
out bound, we can make 
as close to 1 as we like. This is expressed by writing
In general, as shown in Figure 9, the notation
means that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily close to 
by taking sufﬁciently
large negative.
Again, the symbol 
does not represent a number, but the expression
is often read as
“the limit of 
, as x approaches negative inﬁnity, is L”

EXAMPLE 3 Find the inﬁnite limits, limits at inﬁnity, and asymptotes for the func-
tion 
whose graph is shown in Figure 11.
SOLUTION We see that the values of 
become large as 
from both
sides, so
Notice that 
becomes large negative as x approaches 2 from the left, but large
positive as x approaches 2 from the right. So
Thus both of the lines 
and 
are vertical asymptotes.
As x becomes large, it appears that 
approaches 4. But as x decreases through
neg ative values, 
approaches 2. So
This means that both 
and 
are horizontal asymptotes.
■
EXAMPLE 4 Find 
and 
.
SOLUTION Observe that when is large, 
is small. For instance,
In fact, by taking large enough, we can make 
as close to 0 as we please.
Therefore, according to Deﬁnition 3, we have 
Similar reasoning shows that when is large negative, 
is small negative, so we
also have
It follows that the line 
(the -axis) is a horizontal asymptote of the curve
. (This is an equilateral hyperbola; see Figure 12.)

Most of the Limit Laws that were given in Section 1.4 also hold for limits at inﬁn-
ity. It can be proved that the Limit Laws listed in Section 1.4 (with the exception of
Laws 9 and 10) are also valid if “
” is replaced by “
” or “
.” In
particular, if we combine Law 6 with the results of Example 4 we obtain the follow-
ing important rule for calculating limits.
If 
is a positive integer, then
EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate
SOLUTION As becomes large, both numerator and denominator become large, so
it isn’t obvious what happens to their ratio. We need to do some preliminary algebra. 
To evaluate the limit at inﬁnity of any rational function, we ﬁrst divide both the
numerator and denominator by the highest power of that occurs in the denomi-
nator. (We may assume that 
, since we are interested only in large values of .)
In this case the highest power of is 
, and so, using the Limit Laws, we have

]
A similar calculation shows that the limit as 
is also .

see what happens to their difference, so we use algebra to rewrite the function. We

PRECISE DEFINITIONS
The following is a precise version of Deﬁnition 1.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function deﬁned on some open interval that con-
tains the number , except possibly at 
itself. Then
means that for every positive number 
there is a positive number 
such that
if    
This says that the values of

number 
) by taking close enough to (within a distance , where depends on

Given any horizontal line 
, we can ﬁnd a number 
such that if we
restrict 
to lie in the interval 
but 
, then the curve 
lies
above the line 
. You can see that if a larger 
is chosen, then a smaller 
may
be required.

2.1
DERIVATIVES AND RATES OF CHANGE
The problem of ﬁnding the tangent line to a curve and the problem of ﬁnding the
velocity of an object involve ﬁnding the same type of limit, which we call a derivative.
THE TANGENT PROBLEM
The word tangent is derived from the Latin word tangens, which means “touching.”
Thus a tangent to a curve is a line that touches the curve. In other words, a tangent line
should have the same direction as the curve at the point of contact. How can this idea
be made precise?
For a circle we could simply follow Euclid and say that a tangent is a line that inter-
sects the circle once and only once as in Figure 1(a). For more complicated curves this
deﬁnition is inadequate. Figure l(b) shows two lines 
and 
passing through a point
on a curve . The line 
intersects 
only once, but it certainly does not look like
what we think of as a tangent. The line , on the other hand, looks like a tangent but
it intersects 
twice.
To be speciﬁc, let’s look at the problem of trying to ﬁnd a tangent line 
to the
parabola 
in the following example.
EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola 
at the 
point 
.
SOLUTION
We will be able to ﬁnd an equation of the tangent line 
as soon as we
know its slope . The difﬁculty is that we know only one point, , on , whereas 
we need two points to compute the slope. But observe that we can compute an
approximation to 
by choosing a nearby point 
on the parabola (as in Fig-
ure 2) and computing the slope 
of the secant line 
. [A secant line, from the
Latin word secans, meaning cutting, is a line that cuts (intersects) a curve more than
once.]

slope of a tangent line, or a velocity, or any instantaneous rate of change.

We choose 
so that 
. Then
What happens as 
approaches 1? From Figure 3 we see that 
approaches 
along the parabola and the secant lines 
rotate about 
and approach the tangent
line .
It appears that the slope 
of the tangent line is the limit of the slopes of the
secant lines as 
approaches 1:
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we ﬁnd that an equation of the
tangent line at 
is
■
We sometimes refer to the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point as the slope
of the curve at the point. The idea is that if we zoom in far enough toward the point,
the curve looks almost like a straight line. Figure 4 illustrates this procedure for the
curve 
in Example 1. The more we zoom in, the more the parabola looks like a
line. In other words, the curve becomes almost indistinguishable from its tangent line.

In general, if a curve 
has equation 
and we want to ﬁnd the tangent line
to

, where 
,
and compute the slope of the secant line 
:
Then we let 
approach 
along the curve 
by letting 
approach . If 
approaches a number , then we deﬁne the tangent
to be the line through 
with
slope . (This amounts to saying that the tangent line is the limiting position of the
secant line 
as 
approaches . See Figure 5.)
DEFINITION The tangent line to the curve

There is another expression for the slope of a tangent line that is sometimes easier
to use. If

THE VELOCITY PROBLEM
In Section 1.3 we investigated the motion of a ball dropped from the CN Tower and
deﬁned its velocity to be the limiting value of average velocities over shorter and
shorter time periods.
In general, suppose an object moves along a straight line according to an equation
of motion 
, where is the displacement (directed distance) of the object from
the origin at time . The function 
that describes the motion is called the position
function of the object. In the time interval from 
to 
the change in
position is 
. (See Figure 8.) The average velocity over this time inter-
val is
which is the same as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 9.
Now suppose we compute the average velocities over shorter and shorter time inter-
vals 
. In other words, we let 
approach . As in the example of the falling
ball, we deﬁne the velocity (or instantaneous velocity) 
at time 
to be the
limit of these average velocities:

This means that the velocity at time 
is equal to the slope of the tangent line at
(compare Equations 2 and 3).
Now that we know how to compute limits, let’s reconsider the problem of the fall-
ing ball.
EXAMPLE 3 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of
the CN Tower, 450 m above the ground.
(a) What is the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds?
(b) How fast is the ball traveling when it hits the ground?
SOLUTION We ﬁrst use the equation of motion 
to ﬁnd the velocity
after 
seconds:
(a) The velocity after 5 s is 
ms.
(b) Since the observation deck is 450 m above the ground, the ball will hit the
ground at the time 
when 
, that is,
This gives
The velocity of the ball as it hits the ground is therefore
■
DERIVATIVES
We have seen that the same type of limit arises in ﬁnding the slope of a tangent line
(Equation 2) or the velocity of an object (Equation 3). In fact, limits of the form
arise whenever we calculate a rate of change in any of the sciences or in engineering,
such as a rate of reaction in chemistry or a marginal cost in economics. Since this type
of limit occurs so widely, it is given a special name and notation.
DEFINITION The derivative of a function 
at a number , denoted by
, is
if this limit exists.

■
We deﬁned the tangent line to the curve 
at the point 
to be the
line that passes through 
and has slope 
given by Equation 1 or 2. Since, by Deﬁni -
tion 4, this is the same as the derivative 
, we can now say the following.
The tangent line to 
at 
is the line through 
whose
slope is equal to 
, the derivative of 
at .
If we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write an equation
of the tangent line to the curve 
at the point 
:

and the corresponding change in is
The difference quotient
is called the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval
and can be interpreted as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 11.
By analogy with velocity, we consider the average rate of change over smaller and
smaller intervals by letting 
approach 
and therefore letting 
approach . The
limit of these average rates of change is called the (instantaneous) rate of change of
y with respect to x at 

, which is interpreted as the slope of the tangent to the
curve 
at 
:
We recognize this limit as being the derivative 
.
We know that one interpretation of the derivative 
is as the slope of the tan-
gent line to the curve 
when 
. We now have a second interpretation:
The derivative 
is the instantaneous rate of change of 
with
respect to 
when 
.
The connection with the ﬁrst interpretation is that if we sketch the curve 
,
then the instantaneous rate of change is the slope of the tangent to this curve at the
point where 
. This means that when the derivative is large (and therefore the
curve is steep, as at the point 
in Figure 12), the -values change rapidly. When the
derivative is small, the curve is relatively ﬂat and the -values change slowly.
In particular, if 
is the position function of a particle that moves along a
straight line, then 
is the rate of change of the displacement 
with respect to 
the time . In other words, 
is the velocity of the particle at time 
. The speed
of the particle is the absolute value of the velocity, that is, 
In the following example we estimate the rate of change of the national debt with
respect to time. Here the function is deﬁned not by a formula but by a table of values.
EXAMPLE 6 Let 
be the US national debt at time t. The table in the margin
gives approximate values of this function by providing end of year estimates, in
billions of dollars, from 1990 to 2010. Interpret and estimate the value of 
.
SOLUTION The derivative 
means the rate of change of 
with respect to
when 
, that is, the rate of increase of the national debt in 2000.

So we compute and tabulate values of the difference quotient (the average rates of
change) as follows.
From this table we see that 
lies somewhere between 140.04 and 451.70
billion dollars per year. [Here we are making the reasonable assumption that the
debt didn’t ﬂuctuate wildly between 1995 and 2005.] We estimate that the rate of
increase of the national debt of the United States in 2000 was the average of these
two numbers, namely
Another method would be to plot the debt function and estimate the slope of the
tangent line when 
.
■
The rate of change of the debt with respect to time in Example 6 is just one example
of a rate of change. Here are a few of the many others:
The velocity of a particle is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.
Physicists are interested in other rates of change as well—for instance, the rate of
change of work with respect to time (which is called power). Chemists who study a
chemical reaction are interested in the rate of change in the concentration of a reac-
tant with respect to time (called the rate of reaction). A steel manufacturer is inter-
ested in the rate of change of the cost of producing tons of steel per day with respect
to 
(called the marginal cost). A biologist is interested in the rate of change of the
population of a colony of bacteria with respect to time. In fact, the computation of
rates of change is important in all of the natural sciences, in engineering, and even in
the social sciences.
All these rates of change can be interpreted as slopes of tangents. This gives added
signiﬁcance to the solution of the tangent problem. Whenever we solve a problem
involving tangent lines, we are not just solving a problem in geometry. We are also
implicitly solving a great variety of problems involving rates of change in science and
engineering.

The units for the average rate of change
are the units for 
divided by
the units for 
, namely, billions of dol-
lars per year. The instan taneous rate of
change is the limit of the average rates 
of change, so it is measured in the same
units: billions of dollars per year.

2.2
THE DERIVATIVE AS A FUNCTION
In Section 2.1 we considered the derivative of a function
at a ﬁxed number :
Here we change our point of view and let the number a vary. If we replace a in Equa-
tion 1 by a variable x, we obtain
Given any number x for which this limit exists, we assign to x the number 
. 
So we can regard 
as a new function, called the derivative of and deﬁned by Equa-
tion 2. We know that the value of 
at , 
, can be interpreted geometrically as the
slope of the tangent line to the graph of 
at the point 
.
The function 
is called the derivative of 
because it has been “derived” from 
by the limiting operation in Equation 2. The domain of 
is the set 
exists
and may be smaller than the domain of .
EXAMPLE 1 The graph of a function 
is given in Figure 1. Use it to sketch the
graph of the derivative .
SOLUTION We can estimate the value of the derivative at any value of by draw-
ing the tangent at the point 
and estimating its slope. For instance, for 
we draw the tangent at 
in Figure 2(a) and estimate its slope to be about , so
. This allows us to plot the point 
on the graph of 
directly
beneath . Repeating this procedure at several points, we get the graph shown in
Figure 2(b). Notice that the tangents at , , and 
are horizontal, so the derivative
is 0 there and the graph of 
crosses the -axis at the points 
, 
, and 
, directly
beneath A, B, and C. Between 
and 
the tangents have positive slope, so 
is
positive there. But between 
and 
the tangents have negative slope, so 
is
negative there.

OTHER NOTATIONS
If we use the traditional notation 
to indicate that the independent variable is
and the dependent variable is , then some common alternative notations for the
derivative are as follows:
The symbols 
and 
are called differentiation operators because they indicate
the operation of differentiation, which is the process of calculating a derivative.
The symbol 
, which was introduced by Leibniz, should not be regarded as a
ratio (for the time being); it is simply a synonym for 
. Nonetheless, it is a very
useful and suggestive notation, especially when used in conjunction with increment
notation. Referring to Equation 2.1.6, we can rewrite the deﬁnition of derivative in
Leibniz notation in the form
If we want to indicate the value of a derivative 
in Leibniz notation at a speciﬁc
number , we use the notation
or    
which is a synonym for 
.
DIFFERENTIABLE FUNCTIONS

SECTION 2.2  THE DERIVATIVE AS A FUNCTION
87
■LEIBNIZ
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in
Leipzig in 1646 and studied law, theology, 
philosophy, and mathematics at the univer-
sity there, graduating with a bachelor’s
degree at age 17. After earning his doctor-
ate in law at age 20, Leibniz entered the
diplomatic service and spent most of his
life traveling to the capitals of Europe on
political missions. In particular, he worked
to avert a French military threat against
Ger many and attempted to reconcile the
Catholic and Protestant churches.
His serious study of mathematics did not
begin until 1672 while he was on a diplo-
matic mission in Paris. There he built a cal-
culating machine and met scientists, like
Huygens, who directed his attention to the
latest develop ments in mathematics and sci-
ence. Leibniz sought to develop a symbolic
logic and system of notation that would
simplify logical reasoning. In particular, the
version of calculus that he published in
1684 established the notation and the rules
for ﬁnding derivatives that we use today.
Unfortunately, a dreadful priority dispute
arose in the 1690s between the followers of
Newton and those of Leibniz as to who had
invented calculus ﬁrst. Leibniz was even
accused of plagiarism by members of the 
Royal Society in England. The truth is that 
each man invented calculus independently.
Newton arrived at his version of calculus
ﬁrst but, because of his fear of controversy,
did not publish it immediately. So Leibniz’s
1684 account of calculus was the ﬁrst to be
published.

For

Let’s compute the left and right limits separately:

Since these limits are different,

except 0.
A formula for 
is given by
and its graph is shown in Figure 5(b). The fact that 
does not exist is reﬂected
geometrically in the fact that the curve 
does not have a tangent line at 
.
[See Figure 5(a).]
■
Both continuity and differentiability are desirable properties for a function to have.
The following theorem shows how these properties are related.
THEOREM If 
is differentiable at , then 
is continuous at .
PROOF To prove that 
is continuous at , we have to show that 
.
We do this by showing that the difference 
approaches 0.
The given information is that f is differentiable at a, that is,
exists (see Equation 2.1.5). To connect the given and the unknown, we divide and
multiply 
by 
(which we can do when 
):

To use what we have just proved, we start with 
and add and subtract 
:
Therefore

|
NOTE The converse of Theorem 4 is false; that is, there are functions that are con-
tinuous but not differentiable. For instance, the function 
is continuous at 0
because
(See Example 6 in Section 1.4.) But in Example 5 we showed that 
is not differen-
tiable at 0.
HOW CAN A FUNCTION FAIL TO BE DIFFERENTIABLE?
We saw that the function 
in Example 5 is not differentiable at 0 and Fig-
ure 5(a) shows that its graph changes direction abruptly when 
. In general, if the
graph of a function has a “corner” or “kink” in it, then the graph of has no tangent
at this point and 
is not differentiable there. [In trying to compute 
, we ﬁnd that
the left and right limits are different.]
Theorem 4 gives another way for a function not to have a derivative. It says that if
is not continuous at , then 
is not differentiable at . So at any discontinuity (for
instance, a jump discontinuity) 
fails to be differentiable.
A third possibility is that the curve has a vertical tangent line when 
; that is,
is continuous at 
and
This means that the tangent lines become steeper and steeper as 
. Figure 6 shows
one way that this can happen; Figure 7(c) shows another. Figure 7 illustrates the three
possibilities that we have discussed.
A graphing calculator or computer provides another way of looking at differentia-
bility. If 
is differentiable at , then when we zoom in toward the point

graph straightens out and appears more and more like a line. (See Figure 8. We saw a
speciﬁc example of this in Figure 4 in Section 2.1.) But no matter how much we zoom
in toward a point like the ones in Figures 6 and 7(a), we can’t eliminate the sharp point
or corner (see Figure 9).
HIGHER DERIVATIVES
If is a differentiable function, then its derivative 
is also a function, so 
may have
a derivative of its own, denoted by 
. This new function 
is called the sec-
ond derivative of 
because it is the derivative of the derivative of . Using Leibniz
notation, we write the second derivative of

are shown in Figure 10.
We can interpret 
as the slope of the curve 
at the point 
.
In other words, it is the rate of change of the slope of the original curve 
.
Notice from Figure 10 that 
is negative when 
has negative slope
and positive when 
has positive slope. So the graphs serve as a check on
our calculations.

In general, we can interpret a second derivative as a rate of change of a rate of
change. The most familiar example of this is acceleration, which we deﬁne as follows.
If 
is the position function of an object that moves in a straight line, we
know that its ﬁrst derivative represents the velocity 
of the object as a function of
time:
The instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the accel-
eration
of the object. Thus the acceleration function is the derivative of the veloc-
ity function and is therefore the second derivative of the position function:
or, in Leibniz notation,
The third derivative
is the derivative of the second derivative: 
. So
can be interpreted as the slope of the curve 
or as the rate of change
of 
. If 
, then alternative notations for the third derivative are
The process can be continued. The fourth derivative 
is usually denoted by 
. In
general, the th derivative of

and is obtained from

tiating 
times. If

derivative has equation 
and so it is a straight line with slope 6. Since the

Therefore, for all values of ,

We have seen that one application of second derivatives occurs in analyzing the
motion of objects using acceleration. We will investigate another application of sec-
ond derivatives in Section 3.3, where we show how knowledge of

higher derivatives enable us to represent functions as sums of inﬁnite series.

2.3
BASIC DIFFERENTIATION FORMULAS
If it were always necessary to compute derivatives directly from the deﬁnition, as we
did in the preceding section, such computations would be tedious and the evaluation
of some limits would require ingenuity. Fortunately, several rules have been developed
for ﬁnding derivatives without having to use the deﬁnition directly. These formulas
greatly simplify the task of differentiation.
In this section we learn how to differentiate constant functions, power functions,
polynomials, and the sine and cosine functions. Then we use this knowledge to com-
pute rates of change.
Let’s start with the simplest of all functions, the 
. The
graph of this function is the horizontal line 
, which has slope 0, so we must have
. (See Figure 1.) A formal proof, from the deﬁnition of a derivative, is also
easy:
In Leibniz notation, we write this rule as follows.

we found that
For

In ﬁnding the derivative of 
we had to expand 
. Here we need to expand
and we use the Binomial Theorem to do so:
because every term except the ﬁrst has 
as a factor and therefore approaches 0.

The Power Rule enables us to ﬁnd tangent lines without having to resort to the deﬁ-
nition of a derivative. It also enables us to ﬁnd normal lines. The normal line to a
curve

is the line through 
that is perpendicular to the tangent line at .
(In the study of optics, one needs to consider the angle between a light ray and the nor-
mal line to a lens.)
EXAMPLE 3 Find equations of the tangent line and normal line to the curve
at the point 
. Illustrate by graphing the curve and these lines.
SOLUTION The derivative of 
is
So the slope of the tangent line at (1, 1) is 
. Therefore an equation of the
tangent line is
The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, so its slope is the negative
reciprocal of , that is, 
. Thus an equation of the normal line is
We graph the curve and its tangent line and normal line in Figure 4.

NEW DERIVATIVES FROM OLD
When new functions are formed from old functions by addition, subtraction, or mul-
tiplication by a constant, their derivatives can be calculated in terms of derivatives of
the old functions. In particular, the following formula says that the derivative of a con-
stant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.

THE SINE AND COSINE FUNCTIONS
If we sketch the graph of the function 
and use the interpretation of
as the slope of the tangent to the sine curve in order to sketch the graph of
(see 
Exer cise 16 in Section 2.2), then it looks as if the graph of
may be the same as the
cosine curve (see Figure 6).
To prove that this is true we need to use two limits from Section 1.4 (see Equation 6

easily.

SOLUTION
(a) The velocity function is the derivative of the position function.
(b) The velocity after 2 s means the instantaneous velocity when 
, that is,
The velocity after 4 s is
(c) The particle is at rest when 
, that is,
and this is true when 
or 
. Thus the particle is at rest after 1 s and after 3 s.
(d) The particle moves in the positive direction when 
, that is, 
This inequality is true when both factors are positive 
or when both factors
are negative 
. Thus the particle moves in the positive direction in the time
intervals 
and 
. It moves backward (in the negative direction) when
.
(e) Using the information from part (d) we make a schematic sketch in Figure 7 of
the motion of the particle back and forth along a line (the -axis).
(f) Because of what we learned in parts (d) and (e), we need to calculate the dis-
tances traveled during the time intervals [0, 1], [1, 3], and [3, 5] separately.
The distance traveled in the ﬁrst second is
From

EXAMPLE 10 Suppose 
is the total cost that a company incurs in producing
units of a certain commodity. The function 
is called a cost function. If the 
number of items produced is increased from 
to 
, then the additional cost is
, and the average rate of change of the cost is
The limit of this quantity as 
, that is, the instantaneous rate of change of 
cost with respect to the number of items produced, is called the marginal cost by
economists:
[Since often takes on only integer values, it may not make literal sense to let 
approach 0, but we can always replace 
by a smooth approximating function.]
Taking 
and 
large (so that 
is small compared to ), we have
Thus the marginal cost of producing 
units is approximately equal to the cost of
producing one more unit [the 
st unit].
It is often appropriate to represent a total cost function by a polynomial
where 
represents the overhead cost (rent, heat, maintenance) and the other terms 
represent the cost of raw materials, labor, and so on. (The cost of raw materials may
be proportional to , but labor costs might depend partly on higher powers of
because of overtime costs and inefﬁciencies involved in large-scale operations.)
For instance, suppose a company has estimated that the cost (in dollars) of pro-
ducing items is
Then the marginal cost function is
The marginal cost at the production level of 500 items is
This gives the rate at which costs are increasing with respect to the production level
when 
and predicts the cost of the 501st item.
The actual cost of producing the 501st item is

THE PRODUCT AND QUOTIENT RULES
The formulas of this section enable us to differentiate new functions formed from old
functions by multiplication or division.
THE PRODUCT RULE
| By analogy with the Sum and Difference Rules, one might be tempted to guess, as
Leibniz did three centuries ago, that the derivative of a product is the product of the
derivatives. We can see, however, that this guess is wrong by looking at a particular
example. Let 
and 
. Then the Power Rule gives 
and
. But 
, so 
. Thus 
. The correct for-
mula was discovered by Leibniz (soon after his false start) and is called the Product
Rule.
THE PRODUCT RULE If 
and are both differentiable, then
PROOF Let 
. Then
In order to evaluate this limit, we would like to separate the functions 
and as in 
the proof of the Sum Rule. We can achieve this separation by subtracting and adding
the term 
in the numerator:

In words, the Product Rule says that the derivative of a product of two functions is
the ﬁrst function times the derivative of the second function plus the second function
times the derivative of the ﬁrst function.

In words, the Quotient Rule says that the derivative of a quotient is the denomina-
tor times the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator times the derivative of
the denominator, all divided by the square of the denominator.

derivative of any rational function, as the next example illustrates.

function as
before differentiating.
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Knowing the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions, we can use the Quotient
Rule to ﬁnd the derivative of the tangent function:
The derivatives of the remaining trigonometric functions, 
, 
, and 
, can also
be found easily using the Quotient Rule (see Exercises 37–39). We collect all the dif-
ferentiation formulas for trigonometric functions in the following table. Remember

It turns out that the derivative of the composite function 
is the product of the
derivatives of and . This fact is one of the most important of the differentiation rules

as the rate
of change of with respect to , and 
as the rate of change of with respect to

reasonable that changes six times as fast as , and so we expect that

Nonetheless, this reasoning does at least suggest that the Chain Rule is true. A
full proof of the Chain Rule is given at the end of this section.

■JAMES GREGORY
The ﬁrst person to formulate the Chain
Rule was the Scottish mathematician 
James Gregory (1638–1675), who also
designed the ﬁrst practical reﬂecting tele-
scope. Gregory discovered the basic 
ideas of calculus at about the same time 
as Newton. He became the ﬁrst Professor 
of Mathematics at the University of St.
Andrews and later held the same position 
at the University of Edinburgh. But one
year after accepting that position he died 
at the age of 36.

The Chain Rule can be written either in the prime notation
or, if 
and 
, in Leibniz notation:
Equation 3 is easy to remember because if 
and 
were quotients, then we
could cancel 
. Remember, however, that 
has not been deﬁned and 
should
not be thought of as an actual quotient.

When using Formula 3 we should bear in mind that

of 
when 
is considered as a function of 
(called the derivative of 
with respect 
to ), whereas 
refers to the derivative of 
when considered as a function of

as a function  of 
and also as a function of 
. Note that
whereas    
NOTE In using the Chain Rule we work from the outside to the inside. Formula 2
says that we differentiate the outer function 
[at the inner function

multiply by the derivative of the inner function.

EXAMPLE 2 Differentiate (a) 
and (b) 
.
SOLUTION
(a) If 
, then the outer function is the sine function and the inner function
is the squaring function, so the Chain Rule gives
(b) Note that 
. Here the outer function is the squaring function and
the inner function is the sine function. So
The answer can be left as 
or written as 
(by a trigonometric 
identity known as the double-angle formula).
■
In Example 2(a) we combined the Chain Rule with the rule for differentiating the
sine function. In general, if 
, where 
is a differentiable function of , then,
by the Chain Rule,
Thus
In a similar fashion, all of the formulas for differentiating trigonometric functions
can be combined with the Chain Rule.
Let’s make explicit the special case of the Chain Rule where the outer function
is a power function. If 
, then we can write 
where 
.
By using the Chain Rule and then the Power Rule, we get
THE POWER RULE COMBINED WITH THE CHAIN RULE If

number and

Thus, for a differentiable function f, we can write
and is a continuous function of 
. This property of differentiable functions is what
enables us to prove the Chain Rule.
PROOF OF THE CHAIN RULE Suppose 
is differentiable at a and 
is differentiable at 
. If 
is an increment in x and 
and 
are the corre-
sponding increments in u and y, then we can use Equation 5 to write
where 
as 
. Similarly
where 
as 
. If we now substitute the expression for 
from Equa-
tion 6 into Equation 7, we get
so
As
, Equation 6 shows that 
. So both 
and 
as
Therefore
This proves the Chain Rule.

2.6
IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION
The functions that we have met so far can be described by expressing one variable
explicitly in terms of another variable—for example,
or    
or, in general, 
. Some functions, however, are deﬁned implicitly by a relation
between and such as
or
In some cases it is possible to solve such an equation for 
as an explicit function 
(or several functions) of . For instance, if we solve Equation 1 for , we obtain
, so two of the functions determined by the implicit Equation l are
and 
. The graphs of 
and are the upper and
lower semicircles of the cir cle 
. (See Figure 1.)
It’s not easy to solve Equation 2 for explicitly as a function of by hand. (A com-
puter algebra system has no trouble, but the expressions it obtains are very compli-
cated.) Nonetheless, 
is the equation of a curve called the folium of Descartes
shown in Fig ure 2 and it implicitly deﬁnes as several functions of . The graphs of
three such functions are shown in Figure 3. When we say that 
is a function deﬁned
implicitly by Equa tion 2, we mean that the equation
is true for all values of in the domain of .

Fortunately, we don’t need to solve an equation for in terms of in order to ﬁnd
the derivative of . Instead we can use the method of implicit differentiation: This
consists of differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to 
and then solv-
ing the resulting equation for 
. In the examples and exercises of this section it is
always assumed that the given equation determines 
implicitly as a differentiable
function of so that the method of implicit differentiation can be applied.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) If 
, ﬁnd 
.
(b) Find an equation of the tangent to the circle 
at the point 
.
SOLUTION 1
(a) Differentiate both sides of the equation 
:
Remembering that is a function of and using the Chain Rule, we have 
Thus
Now we solve this equation for 
:
(b) At the point 
we have 
and 
, so
An equation of the tangent to the circle at 
is therefore
SOLUTION 2
(b) Solving the equation 
, we get

RELATED RATES
If we are pumping air into a balloon, both the volume and the radius of the balloon are
increasing and their rates of increase are related to each other. But it is much easier to
measure directly the rate of increase of the volume than the rate of increase of the
radius.
In a related rates problem the idea is to compute the rate of change of one quantity
in terms of the rate of change of another quantity (which may be more easily mea-

sured). The procedure is to ﬁnd an equation that relates the two quantities and then use
the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides with respect to time.
EXAMPLE 1 Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume
increases at a rate of 
. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing
when the diameter is 50 cm?
SOLUTION We start by identifying two things:
the given information:
the rate of increase of the volume of air is 
and the unknown:
the rate of increase of the radius when the diameter is 50 cm
In order to express these quantities mathematically, we introduce some suggestive
notation:
Let V be the volume of the balloon and let r be its radius.
The key thing to remember is that rates of change are derivatives. In this problem,
the volume and the radius are both functions of the time . The rate of increase of
the volume with respect to time is the derivative 
, and the rate of increase 
of the radius is 
. We can therefore restate the given and the unknown as 
follows:
Given:
Unknown:
In order to connect 
and 
, we ﬁrst relate 
and by the formula for the
volume of a sphere:
In order to use the given information, we differentiate each side of this equation
with respect to . To differentiate the right side, we need to use the Chain Rule:
Now we solve for the unknown quantity:
If we put 
and 
in this equation, we obtain
The radius of the balloon is increasing at the rate of 
cms.

STRATEGY
Examples 1–3 suggest the following steps in solving related rates problems:
1. Read the problem carefully.

2.8
LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS AND DIFFERENTIALS
We have seen that a curve lies very close to its tangent line near the point of tangency.
In fact, by zooming in toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function, we
noticed that the graph looks more and more like its tangent line. (See Figure 4 in 
Section 2.1.) This observation is the basis for a method of ﬁnding approximate values
of functions.
The idea is that it might be easy to calculate a value 
of a function, but difﬁ-
cult (or even impossible) to compute nearby values of f. So we settle for the easily
computed values of the linear function L whose graph is the tangent line of f at
. (See Figure 1.)
In other words, we use the tangent line at 
as an approximation to the curve
when x is near a. An equation of this tangent line is
and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or tangent line approximation of f at a. The lin-
ear function whose graph is this tangent line, that is,
is called the linearization of f at a.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the linearization of the function 
at 
and
use it to approximate the numbers 
and 
. Are these approximations
overestimates or underestimates?
SOLUTION The derivative of 
is
and so we have 
and 
. Putting these values into Equation 2, we see
that the linearization is
The corresponding linear approximation 
is
(when is near )
In particular, we have
The linear approximation is illustrated in Figure 2. We see that, indeed, the tan-
gent line approximation is a good approximation to the given function when is
near l. We also see that our approximations are overestimates because the tangent
line lies above the curve.
Of course, a calculator could give us approximations for 
and 
, but
the linear approximation gives an approximation over an entire interval.

In the following table we compare the estimates from the linear approximation in
Example 1 with the true values. Notice from this table, and also from Figure 2, that
the tangent line approximation gives good estimates when x is close to 1 but the accu-
racy of the approximation deteriorates when x is farther away from 1.
How good is the approximation that we obtained in Example 1? The next example
shows that by using a graphing calculator or computer we can determine an interval
throughout which a linear approximation provides a speciﬁed accuracy.
EXAMPLE 2 For what values of is the linear approximation
accurate to within 0.5? What about accuracy to within 0.1?
SOLUTION Accuracy to within 0.5 means that the functions should differ by less 
than 0.5: 
Equivalently, we could write
This says that the linear approximation should lie between the curves obtained by
shifting the curve 
upward and downward by an amount 0.5. Figure 3
shows the tangent line 
intersecting the upper curve
at 
and . Zooming in and using the cursor, we estimate that the -coordinate of
is about 
and the -coordinate of 
is about 8.66. Thus we see from the graph
that the approximation
is accurate to within 0.5 when 
. (We have rounded to be safe.)
Similarly, from Figure 4 we see that the approximation is accurate to within 0.1
when 
.

APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS

equation, a physicist sometimes needs to simplify a function by replacing it with its

lum, physics textbooks obtain the expression 
for tangential accelera-
tion and then replace 
by 
with the remark that 
is very close to 
if 
is not
too large. [See, for example, Physics: Calculus, 2d ed., by Eugene Hecht (Paciﬁc
Grove, CA, 2000), p. 431.] You can verify that the linearization of the function
at 
is 
and so the linear approximation at 0 is
(see Exercise 28). So, in effect, the derivation of the formula for the period of a pen-
dulum uses the tangent line approximation for the sine function.
Another example occurs in the theory of optics, where light rays that arrive at 
shallow angles relative to the optical axis are called paraxial rays. In paraxial (or Gaus-
sian) optics, both 
and 
are replaced by their linearizations. In other words,
the linear approximations
and    
are used because 
is close to 0. The results of calculations made with these approxi-
mations became the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses. [See Optics, 4th ed.,
by Eugene Hecht (San Francisco, 2002), p. 154.]
In Section 8.8 we will present several other applications of the idea of linear approxi-
mations to physics.
DIFFERENTIALS
The ideas behind linear approximations are sometimes formulated in the terminology
and notation of differentials. If 
, where 
is a differentiable function, then the
differential
is an independent variable; that is, 
can be given the value of 
any real number. The differential
is then deﬁned in terms of 
by the equation 
So 
is a dependent variable; it depends on the values of 
and 
. If 
is given a
speciﬁc value and is taken to be some speciﬁc number in the domain of , then the
numerical value of 
is determined.
The geometric meaning of differentials is shown in Figure 5. Let 
and
be points on the graph of 
and let 
. The correspond-
ing change in is
The slope of the tangent line 
is the derivative 
. Thus the directed distance
from S to R is 
. Therefore 
represents the amount that the tangent line
rises or falls (the change in the linearization), whereas 
represents the amount that
the curve 
rises or falls when 
changes by an amount 
. Notice from Fig-
ure 5 that the approximation 
becomes better as 
becomes smaller.
If we let 
, then 
and we can rewrite the linear approxima-
tion 
in the notation of differentials:
For instance, for the function 
in Example 1, we have

If 
and 
, then
and
just as we found in Example 1.
Our ﬁnal example illustrates the use of differentials in estimating the errors that
occur because of approximate measurements.
EXAMPLE 3 The radius of a sphere was measured and found to be 21 cm with a
pos sible error in measurement of at most 0.05 cm. What is the maximum error in
using this value of the radius to compute the volume of the sphere?
SOLUTION If the radius of the sphere is , then its volume is 
. If the error
in the measured value of is denoted by 
, then the corresponding error in
the calculated value of 
is 
, which can be approximated by the differential
When 
and 
, this becomes
The maximum error in the calculated volume is about 277 cm .
■
NOTE Although the possible error in Example 3 may appear to be rather large, 
a better picture of the error is given by the relative error, which is computed by 
dividing the error by the total volume:
Therefore the relative error in the volume is approximately three times the relative
error in the radius. In Example 3 the relative error in the radius is approximately
and it produces a relative error of about 0.007 in the vol-
ume. The errors could also be expressed as percentage errors of 
in the radius
and 
in the volume.

27. When blood ﬂows along a blood vessel, the ﬂux 
(the vol-
ume of blood per unit time that ﬂows past a given point) is
proportional to the fourth power of the radius 
of the blood
vessel:
(This is known as Poiseuille’s Law.) A partially clogged
artery can be expanded by an operation called angioplasty,
in which a balloon-tipped catheter is inﬂated inside the
artery in order to widen it and restore the normal blood ﬂow.
Show that the relative change in 
is about four times the
relative change in . How will a 5% increase in the radius
affect the ﬂow of blood?

for the tan-
gential acceleration of the bob of the pendulum. He then

APPLICATIONS OF 
DIFFERENTIATION
We have already investigated some of the applications of derivatives, but now that we know the differ-
entiation rules we are in a better position to pursue the applications of differentiation in greater depth.
Here we learn how derivatives affect the shape of a graph of a function and, in particular, how they help
us locate maximum and minimum values of functions. Many practical problems require us to minimize
a cost or maximize an area or somehow find the best possible outcome of a situation. In particular, we
will be able to investigate the optimal shape of a can and to explain the shape of cells in beehives.
3.1
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES
Some of the most important applications of differential calculus are optimization
problems, in which we are required to ﬁnd the optimal (best) way of doing something.
Here are examples of such problems that we will solve in this chapter:
■What is the shape of a can that minimizes manufacturing costs?
■What is the maximum acceleration of a space shuttle? (This is an important 
question to the astronauts who have to withstand the effects of acceleration.)
■What is the radius of a contracted windpipe that expels air most rapidly
during a cough?
■How far should you stand from a painting in an art gallery to get the best
view of the painting?
These problems can be reduced to ﬁnding the maximum or minimum values of a func-
tion. Let’s ﬁrst explain exactly what we mean by maximum and minimum values.
We see that the highest point on the graph of the function shown in Figure 1 is 
the point 
. In other words, the largest value of
is
. Likewise, the small-
est value is 
. We say that 
is the absolute maximum of and
is the absolute minimum. In general, we use the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION Let be a number in the domain 
of a function . Then
is the
■absolute maximum value of
on 
if
for all in .
■absolute minimum value of
on 
if
for all in .
An absolute maximum or minimum is sometimes called a global maximum or
minimum. The maximum and minimum values of
are called extreme values of .
Figure 2 shows the graph of a function with absolute maximum at and absolute 
minimum at . Note that 
is the highest point on the graph and 
is 
the lowest point. In Figure 2, if we consider only values of 
near 
[for instance, if
we restrict our attention to the interval 
], then 
is the largest of those values
of 
and is called a local maximum value of . Likewise, 
is called a local 
minimum value of

instance]. The function 
also has a local minimum at . In general, we have the fol-
lowing deﬁnition.
DEFINITION The number
is a
■local maximum value of
if
when is near .
■local minimum value of
if
when is near .
In Deﬁnition 2 (and elsewhere), if we say that something is true near , we mean
that it is true on some open interval containing . For instance, in Figure 3 we see that
is a local minimum because it’s the smallest value of
on the interval . It’s
not the absolute minimum because 
takes smaller values when is near 12 (in the
interval , for instance). In fact 
is both a local minimum and the absolute
minimum. Similarly, 
is a local maximum, but not the absolute maximum
because takes larger values near 1.
EXAMPLE 1 The function 
takes on its (local and absolute) maxi-
mum value of 1 inﬁnitely many times, since
for any integer
and
for all . Likewise, 
is its minimum value,
where 
is any integer.
■
EXAMPLE 2 If 
, then 
because 
for all . Therefore
is the absolute (and local) minimum value of . This corresponds to the
fact that the origin is the lowest point on the parabola 
. (See Figure 4.) How-
ever, there is no highest point on the parabola and so this function has no maximum
value.
■
EXAMPLE 3 From the graph of the function 
, shown in Figure 5, we see
that this function has neither an absolute maximum value nor an absolute minimum
value. In fact, it has no local extreme values either.
■
EXAMPLE 4 The graph of the function
is shown in Figure 6. You can see that 
is a local maximum, whereas the
absolute maximum is 
. (This absolute maximum is not a local maxi-
mum because it occurs at an endpoint.) Also, 
is a local minimum and
is both a local and an absolute minimum. Note that
has neither a
local nor an absolute maximum at 
.
■
We have seen that some functions have extreme values, whereas others do not. The 
following theorem gives conditions under which a function is guaranteed to possess
extreme values.
THE EXTREME VALUE THEOREM If 
is continuous on a closed interval
, then 
attains an absolute maximum value 
and an absolute mini-
mum value

The Extreme Value Theorem is illustrated in Figure 7. Note that an extreme value
can be taken on more than once. Although the Extreme Value Theorem is intuitively
very plausible, it is difﬁcult to prove and so we omit the proof.
Figures 8 and 9 show that a function need not possess extreme values if either
hypothesis (continuity or closed interval) is omitted from the Extreme Value Theorem.
The function f whose graph is shown in Figure 8 is deﬁned on the closed interval
[0, 2] but has no maximum value. [Notice that the range of f is [0, 3). The function
takes on values arbitrarily close to 3, but never actually attains the value 3.] This 
does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem because f is not continuous. [None-
theless, a discontinuous function could have maximum and minimum values. See Exer-
cise 13(b).]
The function t shown in Figure 9 is continuous on the open interval (0, 2) but has
neither a maximum nor a minimum value. [The range of t is 
. The function takes
on arbitrarily large values.] This does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem
because the interval (0, 2) is not closed.
The Extreme Value Theorem says that a continuous function on a closed interval
has a maximum value and a minimum value, but it does not tell us how to ﬁnd these
extreme values. We start by looking for local extreme values.
Figure 10 shows the graph of a function 
with a local maximum at 
and a local 
minimum at . It appears that at the maximum and minimum points the tangent lines
are horizontal and therefore each has slope 0. We know that the derivative is the slope
of the tangent line, so it appears that

says that this is always true for differentiable functions.

PROOF Suppose, for the sake of deﬁniteness, that 
has a local maximum at .
Then, according to Deﬁnition 2, 
if 
is sufﬁciently close to . This
implies that if is sufﬁciently close to 0, with being positive or negative, then
and therefore
We can divide both sides of an inequality by a positive number. Thus if 
and
is sufﬁciently small, we have
Taking the right-hand limit of both sides of this inequality (using Theorem 1.4.3),
we get
But since 
exists, we have
and so we have shown that 
.
If 
, then the direction of the inequality 
is reversed when we divide by :
So, taking the left-hand limit, we have
We have shown that 
and also that 
. Since both of these inequali-
ties must be true, the only possibility is that 
.
We have proved Fermat’s Theorem for the case of a local maximum. The case of
a local minimum can be proved in a similar manner, or we could use Exercise 58 to
deduce it from the case we have just proved (see Exercise 59).
Although Fermat’s Theorem is very useful, we have to guard against reading too
much into it. If 
, then 
, so 
. But 
has no maximum or
minimum at 0, as you can see from its graph in Figure 11. The fact that 
sim-
ply means that the curve 
has a horizontal tangent at 
. Instead of having a
maximum or minimum at 
, the curve crosses its horizontal tangent there.
|
Thus, when 
, 
doesn’t necessarily have a maximum or minimum at .
(In other words, the converse of Fermat’s Theorem is false in general.)
We should bear in mind that there may be an extreme value where 
does not
exist. For instance, the function 
has its (local and absolute) minimum
value at 0 (see Figure 12), but that value cannot be found by setting 
because,
as was shown in Example 5 in Section 2.2, 
does not exist.
Fermat’s Theorem does suggest that we should at least start looking for extreme
values of at the numbers where 
or where 
does not exist. Such num-
bers are given a special name.

■FERMAT
Fermat’s Theorem is named after Pierre
Fermat (1601–1665), a French lawyer who
took up mathematics as a hobby. Despite
his amateur status, Fermat was one of 
the two inventors of analytic geometry
(Descartes was the other). His methods for
ﬁnding tangents to curves and maximum
and minimum values (before the invention
of limits and derivatives) made him a 
forerunner of Newton in the creation of
differential calculus.

DEFINITION A critical number of a function 
is a number in the
domain of 
such that either 
or 
does not exist.
EXAMPLE 5 Find the critical numbers of 
.
SOLUTION The Product Rule gives
[The same result could be obtained by ﬁrst writing 
.] Therefore
if 
, that is, 
, and 
does not exist when 
. Thus
the critical numbers are
and .
■
In terms of critical numbers, Fermat’s Theorem can be rephrased as follows (com-
pare Deﬁnition 6 with Theorem 4):
If f has a local maximum or minimum at c, then c is a critical number 
of f.
To ﬁnd an absolute maximum or minimum of a continuous function on a closed
interval, we note that either it is local [in which case it occurs at a critical number by
] or it occurs at an endpoint of the interval. Thus the following three-step procedure
always works.
THE CLOSED INTERVAL METHOD To ﬁnd the absolute maximum and mini-
mum values of a continuous function 
on a closed interval 
:
1. Find the values of 
at the critical numbers of 
in 
.
2. Find the values of 
at the endpoints of the interval.
3. The largest of the values from Steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum
value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.
EXAMPLE 6 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function
SOLUTION Since 
is continuous on 
, we can use the Closed Interval
Method:
Since 
exists for all , the only critical numbers of 
occur when 
, that
is, 
or

55. When a foreign object lodged in the trachea (windpipe)
forces a person to cough, the diaphragm thrusts upward
causing an increase in pressure in the lungs. This is accom-
panied by a contraction of the trachea, making a narrower
channel for the expelled air to ﬂow through. For a given
amount of air to escape in a ﬁxed time, it must move faster
through the narrower channel than the wider one. The
greater the velocity of the airstream, the greater the force on
the foreign object. X-rays show that the radius of the circu-
lar tracheal tube contracts to about two-thirds of its normal
radius during a cough. According to a mathematical model
of coughing, the velocity of the airstream is related to the
radius of the trachea by the equation
where is a constant and 
is the normal radius of the tra-
chea. The restriction on is due to the fact that the tracheal

THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM
We will see that many of the results of this chapter depend on one central fact, which
is called the Mean Value Theorem. But to arrive at the Mean Value Theorem we ﬁrst
need the following result.
ROLLE’S THEOREM Let 
be a function that satisﬁes the following three
hypotheses:
1.
is continuous on the closed interval 
.
2.
is differentiable on the open interval 
.
3.
Then there is a number in 
such that 
.
Before giving the proof let’s take a look at the graphs of some typical functions that
satisfy the three hypotheses. Figure 1 shows the graphs of four such functions. In each
case it appears that there is at least one point 
on the graph where the tangent
is horizontal and therefore 
. Thus Rolle’s Theorem is plausible.

■ROLLE
Rolle’s Theorem was ﬁrst published in
1691 by the French mathematician Michel
Rolle (1652–1719) in a book entitled 
Méthode pour resoudre les Egalitez. He
was a vocal critic of the methods of his day
and attacked calculus as being a “collection
of ingenious fallacies.” Later, however, he
became convinced of the essential correct-
ness of the methods of calculus.

PROOF There are three cases:
CASE I
, a constant
Then 
, so the number can be taken to be any number in 
.
CASE II
for some x in 
[as in Figure 1(b) or (c)]
By the Extreme Value Theorem (which we can apply by hypothesis 1), 
has a max-
imum value somewhere in 
. Since 
, it must attain this maximum
value at a number in the open interval 
. Then 
has a local maximum at
and, by hypothesis 2, 
is differentiable at . Therefore 
by Fermat’s
Theorem.
CASE III
for some x in 
[as in Figure 1(c) or (d)]
By the Extreme Value Theorem, 
has a minimum value in 
and, since
, it attains this minimum value at a number in 
. Again 
by
Fermat’s Theorem.
EXAMPLE 1 Let’s apply Rolle’s Theorem to the position function 
of a
moving object. If the object is in the same place at two different instants 
and
, then 
. Rolle’s Theorem says that there is some instant of time
between 
and 
when 
; that is, the velocity is 0. (In particular, you
can see that this is true when a ball is thrown directly upward.)
■
EXAMPLE 2 Prove that the equation 
has exactly one real root.
SOLUTION First we use the Intermediate Value Theorem (1.5.9) to show that a root
exists. Let 
. Then 
and 
. Since 
is
a polynomial, it is continuous, so the Intermediate Value Theorem states that there is
a number between 0 and 1 such that 
. Thus the given equation has a root.
To show that the equation has no other real root, we use Rolle’s Theorem and
argue by contradiction. Suppose that it had two roots and . Then
and, since 
is a polynomial, it is differentiable on 
and continuous on 
.
Thus by Rolle’s Theorem there is a number between 
and 
such that 
.
But
(since 
) so 
can never be 0. This gives a contradiction. Therefore the
equation can’t have two real roots.
■
Our main use of Rolle’s Theorem is in proving the following important theorem,
which was ﬁrst stated by another French mathematician, Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM Let 
be a function that satisﬁes the following
hypotheses:
1.
is continuous on the closed interval 
.
2.
is differentiable on the open interval 
.
Then there is a number in 
such that
or, equivalently,
Before proving this theorem, we can see that it is reasonable by interpreting it geo-
metrically. Figures 3 and 4 show the points 
and 
on the graphs of
two differentiable functions. The slope of the secant line 
is
which is the same expression as on the right side of Equation 1. Since 
is the slope
of the tangent line at the point 
, the Mean Value Theorem, in the form given
by Equation 1, says that there is at least one point 
on the graph where the
slope of the tangent line is the same as the slope of the secant line 
. In other words,
there is a point 
where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line 
. (Imagine a
line parallel to 
, starting far away and moving parallel to itself until it touches the
graph for the ﬁrst time.)
PROOF We apply Rolle’s Theorem to a new function 
deﬁned as the difference
between 
and the function whose graph is the secant line 
. Using Equation 3, 
we see that the equation of the line 
can be written as

■The Mean Value Theorem is an
example of what is called an existence
theorem. Like the Intermediate Value
Theorem, the Extreme Value Theorem,
and Rolle’s Theorem, it guarantees that
there exists a number with a certain
property, but it doesn’t tell us how to
ﬁnd the number.

So, as shown in Figure 5,
First we must verify that satisﬁes the three hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem.
1. The function 
is continuous on 
because it is the sum of 
and a ﬁrst-
degree polynomial, both of which are continuous.
2. The function 
is differentiable on 
because both 
and the ﬁrst-degree
polynomial are differentiable. In fact, we can compute 
directly from Equa-
tion 4:
(Note that 
and 
are constants.)
3.
Therefore 
.
Since 
satisﬁes the hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem, that theorem says there is a
number in 
such that 
. Therefore
and so
EXAMPLE 3 To illustrate the Mean Value Theorem with a speciﬁc function, let’s
consider 
. Since 
is a polynomial, it is continuous and
differentiable for all , so it is certainly continuous on 
and differentiable on
. Therefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number in 
such that
Now 
, and 
, so this equation becomes
which gives

Figure 6 illustrates this calculation: The tangent line at this value of is parallel to

■LAGRANGE AND THE 
MEAN VALUE THEOREM
The Mean Value Theorem was ﬁrst 
formulated by Joseph-Louis Lagrange
(1736–1813), born in Italy of a French
father and an Italian mother. He was a
child prodigy and became a professor in
Turin at the tender age of 19. Lagrange
made great contributions to number theory,
theory of functions, theory of equations,
and analytical and celestial mechanics. In
particular, he applied calculus to the analy-
sis of the stability of the solar system. At
the invitation of Frederick the Great, he
succeeded Euler at the Berlin Academy
and, when Frederick died, Lagrange
accepted King Louis XVI’s invitation to
Paris, where he was given apartments in
the Louvre. Despite all the trappings of
luxury and fame, he was a kind and quiet
man, living only for science.

and the velocity at 
is 
. Thus the Mean Value Theorem (in the form of
Equation 1) tells us that at some time 
between 
and 
the instantaneous
velocity 
is equal to that average velocity. For instance, if a car traveled 180 km
in 2 hours, then the speedometer must have read 90 kmh at least once.
In general, the Mean Value Theorem can be interpreted as saying that there is a
number at which the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the average rate of
change over an interval.
■
The main signiﬁcance of the Mean Value Theorem is that it enables us to obtain
information about a function from information about its derivative. The next example
provides an instance of this principle.
EXAMPLE 5 Suppose that 
and 
for all values of . How
large can

SOLUTION We are given that 
is differentiable (and therefore continuous) every-
where. In particular, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem on the interval 
.
There exists a number such that
so
We are given that 
for all , so in particular we know that 
. Multi-
plying both sides of this inequality by 2, we have 
, so
The largest possible value for 
is 7.
■
The Mean Value Theorem can be used to establish some of the basic facts of dif-
ferential calculus. One of these basic facts is the following theorem. Others will be
found in the following sections.

on

PROOF Let

ferentiable on 
, it must be differentiable on 
and continuous on 
.
By applying the Mean Value Theorem to 
on the interval 
, we get a number
such that 
and
Since 
for all , we have 
, and so Equation 6 becomes
Therefore

that

DERIVATIVES AND THE SHAPES OF GRAPHS
Many of the applications of calculus depend on our ability to deduce facts about a
function from information concerning its derivatives. Because 
represents the
slope of the curve 
at the point 
, it tells us the direction in which the
curve proceeds at each point. So it is reasonable to expect that information about 
will provide us with information about

WHAT DOES 
SAY ABOUT ?
To see how the derivative of 
can tell us where a function is increasing or decreas-
ing, look at Figure 1. (Increasing functions and decreasing functions were deﬁned in
Section 1.1.) Between 
and 
and between 
and , the tangent lines have positive
slopes and so 
. Between 
and , the tangent lines have negative slopes and
so 
. Thus it appears that increases when 
is positive and decreases
when 
is negative. To prove that this is always the case, we use the Mean Value
Theorem.
INCREASING/DECREASING TEST
(a) If 
on an interval, then 
is increasing on that interval.
(b) If 
on an interval, then 
is decreasing on that interval.
PROOF
(a) Let 
and 
be any two numbers in the interval with 
. According to the
deﬁnition of an increasing function (page 7) we have to show that 
.
Because we are given that 
, we know that
is differentiable on 
.
So by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number c between 
and 
such that
Now 
by assumption and 
because 
. Thus the right 
side of Equation 1 is positive, and so
This shows that 
is increasing.
Part (b) is proved similarly.
EXAMPLE 1 Find where the function 
is increas-
ing and where it is decreasing.
SOLUTION
To use the ID Test we have to know where 
and where 
. This
depends on the signs of the three factors of 
, namely, 
, 
, and 
.
We divide the real line into intervals whose endpoints are the critical numbers 
,
and 
and arrange our work in a chart. A plus sign indicates that the given expres-
sion is positive, and a minus sign indicates that it is negative. The last column of 
the chart gives the conclusion based on the ID Test. For instance, 
for
, so 
is decreasing on (0, 2). (It would also be true to say that
is
decreasing on the closed interval
.)
The graph of 
shown in Figure 2 conﬁrms the information in the chart.

CHAPTER 3
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
Recall from Section 3.1 that if 
has a local maximum or minimum at , then
must be a critical number of 
(by Fermat’s Theorem), but not every critical number
gives rise to a maximum or a minimum. We therefore need a test that will tell us
whether or not 
has a local maximum or minimum at a critical number.
You can see from Figure 2 that 
is a local maximum value of 
because
increases on 
and decreases on 
. Or, in terms of derivatives, 
for
and 
for 
. In other words, the sign of 
changes
from positive to negative at . This observation is the basis of the following test.
THE FIRST DERIVATIVE TEST Suppose that is a critical number of a continu-
ous function .
(a) If 
changes from positive to negative at , then 
has a local maximum
at .
(b) If 
changes from negative to positive at , then 
has a local minimum 
at .
(c) If 
does not change sign at (for example, if 
is positive on both sides
of c or negative on both sides), then 
has no local maximum or minimum
at .
The First Derivative Test is a consequence of the ID Test. In part (a), for instance,
since the sign of 
changes from positive to negative at c, f is increasing to the left
of c and decreasing to the right of c. It follows that f has a local maximum at c.
It is easy to remember the First Derivative Test by visualizing diagrams such as
those in Figure 3.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the local minimum and maximum values of the function 
in
Example 1.
SOLUTION From the chart in the solution to Example 1 we see that 
changes
from negative to positive at 1, so 
is a local minimum value by the First
Derivative Test. Similarly, 
changes from negative to positive at 2, so
is also a local minimum value. As previously noted, 
is a local maximum
value because 
changes from positive to negative at 0.

.
Because is differentiable everywhere, the only critical numbers are 
and
and so we analyze in the following table.
Because 
changes from positive to negative at 
, the First Derivative Test
tells us that there is a local maximum at 
and the local maximum value is
Likewise, 
changes from negative to positive at 
and so
is a local minimum value. The graph of in Figure 4 supports our conclusion.

WHAT DOES 
SAY ABOUT ?
Figure 5 shows the graphs of two increasing functions on 
. Both graphs join
point 
to point 
but they look different because they bend in different directions.
How can we distinguish between these two types of behavior? In Figure 6 tangents to
these curves have been drawn at several points. In (a) the curve lies above the tangents
and 
is called concave upward on 
. In (b) the curve lies below the tangents and
is called concave downward on 
.
DEFINITION If the graph of 
lies above all of its tangents on an interval ,
then it is called concave upward on . If the graph of 
lies below all of its
tangents on I, it is called concave downward on .

CHAPTER 3
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION

Figure 7 shows the graph of a function that is concave upward (abbreviated CU) on
the intervals
,
, and
and concave downward (CD) on the intervals
,
, and 
.
DEFINITION A point 
on a curve 
is called an inﬂection point if
is continuous there and the curve changes from concave upward to concave
downward or from concave downward to concave upward at .
For instance, in Figure 7, 
, and 
are the points of inﬂection. Notice that if
a curve has a tangent at a point of inﬂection, then the curve crosses its tangent there.
Let’s see how the second derivative helps determine the intervals of concavity.
Looking at Figure 6(a), you can see that, going from left to right, the slope of the tan-
gent increases. This means that the derivative 
is an increasing function and there-
fore its derivative 
is positive. Likewise, in Figure 6(b) the slope of the tangent
decreases from left to right, so 
decreases and therefore 
is negative. This reason-
ing can be reversed and suggests that the following theorem is true. A proof is given
in Appendix C with the help of the Mean Value Theorem.
CONCAVITY TEST
(a) If 
for all in , then the graph of 
is concave upward on .
(b) If 
for all in , then the graph of 
is concave downward on .
In view of the Concavity Test, there is a point of inﬂection at any point where the
second derivative changes sign.
EXAMPLE 4 Sketch a possible graph of a function 
that satisﬁes the following 
conditions:
SOLUTION Condition (i) tells us that 
is increasing on 
and decreasing on
. Condition (ii) says that 
is concave upward on 
and 
, and
concave downward on 
. From condition (iii) we know that the graph of 
has
two horizontal asymptotes: 
and 
.

We ﬁrst draw the horizontal asymptote 
as a dashed line (see Figure 8).
We then draw the graph of 
approaching this asymptote at the far left, increasing to
its maximum point at 
and decreasing toward the x-axis at the far right. We
also make sure that the graph has inﬂection points when 
and 2. Notice that
we made the curve bend upward for 
and 
, and bend downward when
x is between 2 and 2.
■
Another application of the second derivative is the following test for maximum and
minimum values. It is a consequence of the Concavity Test.
THE SECOND DERIVATIVE TEST Suppose 
is continuous near .
(a) If 
and 
, then 
has a local minimum at .
(b) If 
and 
, then 
has a local maximum at .
For instance, part (a) is true because 
near c and so
is concave upward
near . This means that the graph of 
lies above its horizontal tangent at c and so
has a local minimum at . (See Figure 9.)
EXAMPLE 5 Discuss the curve 
with respect to concavity, points of
inﬂection, and local maxima and minima. Use this information to sketch the curve.
SOLUTION If 
, then
To ﬁnd the critical numbers we set 
and obtain 
and 
. To use
the Second Derivative Test we evaluate 
at these critical numbers:
Since 
and 
, 
is a local minimum. Since 
,
the Second Derivative Test gives no information about the critical number 0. But
since 
for 
and also for 
, the First Derivative Test tells us
that 
does not have a local maximum or minimum at 0. [In fact, the expression for
shows that
decreases to the left of 3 and increases to the right of 3.]
Since 
when 
or , we divide the real line into intervals with these
numbers as endpoints and complete the following chart.
The point 
is an inﬂection point since the curve changes from concave
upward to concave downward there. Also 
is an inﬂection point since the
curve changes from concave downward to concave upward there.
Using the local minimum, the intervals of concavity, and the inﬂection points, we
sketch the curve in Figure 10.

NOTE The Second Derivative Test is inconclusive when 
. In other words,
at such a point there might be a maximum, there might be a minimum, or there might
be neither (as in Example 5). This test also fails when 
does not exist. In such
cases the First Derivative Test must be used. In fact, even when both tests apply, the
First Derivative Test is often the easier one to use.
EXAMPLE 6 Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION You can use the differentiation rules to check that the ﬁrst two deriva-
tives are
Since 
when 
and 
does not exist when 
or 
, the
critical numbers are 
, and .
To ﬁnd the local extreme values we use the First Derivative Test. Since
changes from negative to positive at 0, 
is a local minimum. Since
changes from positive to negative at 4, 
is a local maximum. The sign of
does not change at 6, so there is no minimum or maximum there. (The Second
Derivative Test could be used at 4 but not at 0 or 6 since 
does not exist at either
of these numbers.)
Looking at the expression for 
and noting that 
for all , we have
for 
and for 
and 
for 
. So 
is concave
downward on 
and 
and concave upward on 
, and the only inﬂec-
tion point is 
. The graph is sketched in Figure 11. Note that the curve has verti-
cal tangents at 
and 
because 
as

CURVE SKETCHING
So far we have been concerned with some particular aspects of curve sketching:
domain, range, symmetry, limits, continuity, and asymptotes in Chapter 1; deriva tives
and tangents in Chapter 2; and extreme values, intervals of increase and decrease, con-
cavity, and points of inﬂection in this chapter. It’s now time to put all of this informa-
tion together to sketch graphs that reveal the important features of functions.
You may ask: Why don’t we just use a graphing calculator or computer to graph a
curve? Why do we need to use calculus?
It’s true that modern technology is capable of producing very accurate graphs. But
even the best graphing devices have to be used intelligently. The use of calculus 
enables us to discover the most interesting aspects of curves and to detect behavior

that we might otherwise overlook. We will see in Example 4 how calculus helps us to
avoid the pitfalls of technology.
GUIDELINES FOR SKETCHING A CURVE
The following checklist is intended as a guide to sketching a curve 
by hand.
Not every item is relevant to every function. (For instance, a given curve might not
have an asymptote or possess symmetry.) But the guidelines provide all the informa-
tion you need to make a sketch that displays the most important aspects of the function.
A. Domain It’s often useful to start by determining the domain 
of , that is, the set
of values of for which 
is deﬁned.
B. Intercepts The -intercept is 
and this tells us where the curve intersects the 
-axis. To ﬁnd the -intercepts, we set 
and solve for . (You can omit this
step if the equation is difﬁcult to solve.)
C. Symmetry
(i) If 
for all 
in 
, that is, the equation of the curve is
unchanged when is replaced by 
, then 
is an even function and the curve is
symmetric about the -axis. This means that our work is cut in half. If we know
what the curve looks like for 
, then we need only reﬂect about the -axis to
obtain the complete curve [see Figure 1(a)]. Here are some examples:
, and 
.
(ii) If 
for all 
in , then 
is an odd function and the curve
is symmetric about the origin. Again we can obtain the complete curve if we know
what it looks like for 
. [Rotate 180° about the origin; see Figure 1(b).] Some
simple examples of odd functions are 
, and 
.
(iii) If 
for all in , where 
is a positive constant, then 
is
called a periodic function and the smallest such number 
is called the period. 
For instance, 
has period 
and 
has period . If we know what
the graph looks like in an interval of length , then we can use translation to sketch
the entire graph (see Figure 2).
D. Asymptotes
(i) Horizontal Asymptotes. Recall from Section 1.6 that if
or
, then the line 
is a horizontal asymptote of the curve
. If it turns out that 
(or 
), then we do not have an
asymptote to the right, but that is still useful information for sketching the curve.
(ii) Vertical Asymptotes. Recall from Section 1.6 that the line 
is a ver-
tical asymptote if at least one of the following statements is true:

(For rational functions you can locate the vertical asymptotes by equating the
denominator to 0 after canceling any common factors. But for other functions this
method does not apply.) Furthermore, in sketching the curve it is very useful 
to know exactly which of the statements in 
is true. If 
is not deﬁned but
is an endpoint of the domain of , then you should compute 
or
, whether or not this limit is inﬁnite.
E. Intervals of Increase or Decrease Use the I/D Test. Compute 
and ﬁnd the
intervals on which 
is positive (
is increasing) and the intervals on which
is negative (
is decreasing).
F. Local Maximum and Minimum Values Find the critical numbers of 
[the num-
bers where 
or 
does not exist]. Then use the First Derivative Test.
If 
changes from positive to negative at a critical number , then 
is a local 
maximum. If 
changes from negative to positive at , then 
is a local mini-
mum. Although it is usually preferable to use the First Derivative Test, you can 
use the Second Derivative Test if 
and 
. Then 
implies that 
is a local minimum, whereas 
implies that 
is a local
maximum.
G. Concavity and Points of Inflection Compute 
and use the Concavity Test.
The curve is concave upward where 
and concave downward where
. Inﬂection points occur where the direction of concavity changes.
H. Sketch the Curve Using the information in items A–G, draw the graph. Sketch the
asymptotes as dashed lines. Plot the intercepts, maximum and minimum points,
and inﬂection points. Then make the curve pass through these points, rising 
and falling according to E, with concavity according to G, and approaching the
asymptotes. If additional accuracy is desired near any point, you can compute the
value of the derivative there. The tangent indicates the direction in which the curve
proceeds.
EXAMPLE 1 Use the guidelines to sketch the curve 
.
A. The domain is
B. The - and -intercepts are both 0.
C. Since 
, the function 
is even. The curve is symmetric about the 
-axis.
D.
Therefore the line 
is a horizontal asymptote. 
Since the denominator is 0 when 
, we compute the following limits:
Therefore the lines 
and 
are vertical asymptotes. This information
about limits and asymptotes enables us to draw the preliminary sketch in 
Figure 3, showing the parts of the curve near the asymptotes.

GRAPHING WITH TECHNOLOGY
When we use technology to graph a curve, our strategy is different from that in Exam-
ples 1–3. Here we start with a graph produced by a graphing calculator or computer
and then we reﬁne it. We use calculus to make sure that we reveal all the important
features of the curve. And with the use of graphing devices we can tackle curves that
would be far too complicated to consider without technology.

SOLUTION If we specify a domain but not a range, many graphing devices will
deduce a suitable range from the values computed. Figure 8 shows the plot from one
such device if we specify that 
. Although this viewing rectangle is use-
ful for showing that the asymptotic behavior (or end behavior) is the same as for
, it is obviously hiding some ﬁner detail. So we change to the viewing rect-
angle 
by 
shown in Figure 9.
From this graph it appears that there is an absolute minimum value of about
3 when 
(by using the cursor) and 
is decreasing on
and increasing on 
. Also there appears to be a horizontal tangent at the
origin and inﬂection points when 
and when is somewhere between 
and 
.
Now let’s try to conﬁrm these impressions using calculus. We differentiate 
and get 
When we graph 
in Figure 10 we see that 
changes from negative to positive
when 
; this conﬁrms (by the First Derivative Test) the minimum value
that we found earlier. But, perhaps to our surprise, we also notice that 
changes
from positive to negative when 
and from negative to positive when 
.
This means that 
has a local maximum at 0 and a local minimum when 
,
but these were hidden in Figure 9. Indeed, if we now zoom in toward the origin in
Figure 11, we see what we missed before: a local maximum value of 0 when
and a local minimum value of about 
when 
.
What about concavity and inﬂection points? From Figures 9 and 11 there appear
to be inﬂection points when is a little to the left of 
and when is a little to the
right of 0. But it’s difﬁcult to determine inﬂection points from the graph of , so we
graph the second derivative 
in Figure 12. We see that 
changes from positive 
to negative when 
and from negative to positive when 
. So, cor-
rect to two decimal places, 
is concave upward on 
and 
and
concave downward on 
. The inﬂection points are 
and 
.
We have discovered that no single graph reveals all the important features of 
this polynomial. But Figures 9 and 11, when taken together, do provide an accurate
picture.

OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
The methods we have learned in this chapter for ﬁnding extreme values have practi-
cal applications in many areas of life. A businessperson wants to minimize costs and
maximize proﬁts. A traveler wants to minimize transportation time. Fermat’s Principle
in optics states that light follows the path that takes the least time. In this section and
the next we solve such problems as maximizing areas, volumes, and proﬁts and min-
imizing distances, times, and costs.
In solving such practical problems the greatest challenge is often to convert the
word problem into a mathematical optimization problem by setting up the function
that is to be maximized or minimized. The following steps may be useful.

1. Understand the Problem The ﬁrst step is to read the problem carefully until it is
clearly understood. Ask yourself: What is the unknown? What are the given quan-
tities? What are the given conditions?
2. Draw a Diagram In most problems it is useful to draw a diagram and identify
the given and required quantities on the diagram.
3. Introduce Notation Assign a symbol to the quantity that is to be maximized
or minimized (let’s call it 
for now). Also select symbols 
for other unknown quantities and label the diagram with these symbols. It may
help to use initials as suggestive symbols—for example, 
for area, 
for
height, for time.
4. Express 
in terms of some of the other symbols from Step 3.
5. If 
has been expressed as a function of more than one variable in Step 4, use the
given information to ﬁnd relationships (in the form of equations) among these
variables. Then use these equations to eliminate all but one of the variables in the
expression for . Thus 
will be expressed as a function of one variable , say,
. Write the domain of this function.
6. Use the methods of Sections 3.1 and 3.3 to ﬁnd the absolute maximum or mini-
mum value of . In particular, if the domain of 
is a closed interval, then the
Closed Interval Method in Section 3.1 can be used.
EXAMPLE 1 A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular
ﬁeld that borders a straight river. He needs no fence along the river. What are the
dimensions of the ﬁeld that has the largest area?
SOLUTION In order to get a feeling for what is happening in this problem, let’s
experiment with some special cases. Figure 1 (not to scale) shows three possible
ways of laying out the 2400 ft of fencing. We see that when we try shallow, wide
ﬁelds or deep, narrow ﬁelds, we get relatively small areas. It seems plausible that
there is some intermediate conﬁguration that produces the largest area.
Figure 2 illustrates the general case. We wish to maximize the area 
of the rect-
angle. Let and be the depth and width of the rectangle (in feet). Then we express
in terms of and :
We want to express 
as a function of just one variable, so we eliminate by
expressing it in terms of . To do this we use the given information that the total
length of the fencing is 2400 ft. Thus

From this equation we have

maximize is
The derivative is

number or at an endpoint of the interval. Since

[Alternatively, we could have observed that

maximum.]
Thus the rectangular ﬁeld should be 600 ft deep and 1200 ft wide.

EXAMPLE 2 A cylindrical can is to be made to hold 1 L of oil. Find the dimen-
sions that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can.
SOLUTION Draw the diagram as in Figure 3, where is the radius and 
the height
(both in centimeters). In order to minimize the cost of the metal, we minimize the
total surface area of the cylinder (top, bottom, and sides). From Figure 4 we see that
the sides are made from a rectangular sheet with dimensions 
and h. So the
surface area is
To eliminate 
we use the fact that the volume is given as 1 L, which we take to
be 1000 cm . Thus
which gives

Therefore the function that we want to minimize is

[Alternatively, we could argue that

See Figure 5.]
The value of

Thus to minimize the cost of the can, the radius should be 
cm and
the height should be equal to twice the radius, namely, the diameter.
■
NOTE 1 The argument used in Example 2 to justify the absolute minimum is a
variant of the First Derivative Test (which applies only to local maximum or minimum
values) and is stated here for future reference.
FIRST DERIVATIVE TEST FOR ABSOLUTE EXTREME VALUES Suppose that is
a critical number of a continuous function 
deﬁned on an interval.

(b) If

NOTE 2 An alternative method for solving optimization problems is to use implicit
differentiation. Let’s look at Example 2 again to illustrate the method. We work with
the same equations
but instead of eliminating h, we differentiate both equations implicitly with respect 
to r:
The minimum occurs at a critical number, so we set

equations

Instead of minimizing , we minimize its square:

metric nature of the problem, it’s obvious that there is a closest point but not a far-
thest point.) The corresponding value of is

EXAMPLE 4 A man launches his boat from point 
on a bank of a straight river, 
3 km wide, and wants to reach point , 8 km downstream on the opposite bank, as
quickly as possible (see Figure 7). He could row his boat directly across the river to
point 
and then run to , or he could row directly to , or he could row to some
point 
between 
and 
and then run to . If he can row 6 kmh and run 8 kmh,
where should he land to reach 
as soon as possible? (We assume that the speed of
the water is negligible compared with the speed at which the man rows.)
SOLUTION If we let be the distance from 
to , then the running distance 
is 
and the Pythagorean Theorem gives the rowing distance as
. We use the equation
Then the rowing time is 
and the running time is 
, so the total
time 
as a function of is
The domain of this function 
is

he rows directly to . The derivative of

The only critical number is

critical number or at an endpoint of the domain

EXAMPLE 5 Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in a
semicircle of radius .
SOLUTION 1 Let’s take the semicircle to be the upper half of the circle
with center the origin. Then the word inscribed means that the rect-
angle has two vertices on the semicircle and two vertices on the -axis as shown in
Figure 9.
Let 
be the vertex that lies in the ﬁrst quadrant. Then the rectangle has sides
of lengths 
and , so its area is
To eliminate we use the fact that 
lies on the circle 
and so
. Thus
The domain of this function is 
. Its derivative is
which is 0 when 
, that is, 
(since 
). This value of gives a 
maximum value of 
since 
and 
. Therefore the area of the largest
inscribed rectangle is
SOLUTION 2 A simpler solution is possible if we think of using an angle as a
variable. Let 
be the angle shown in Figure 10. Then the area of the rectangle is
We know that 
has a maximum value of 1 and it occurs when 
. So

Notice that this trigonometric solution doesn’t involve differentiation. In fact, we 
didn’t need to use calculus at all.

APPLICATIONS TO BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
In Example 10 in Section 2.3 we introduced the idea of marginal cost. Recall that if
, the cost function, is the cost of producing units of a certain product, then the
marginal cost is the rate of change of 
with respect to . In other words, the mar-
ginal cost function is the derivative, 
, of the cost function.
Now let’s consider marketing. Let 
be the price per unit that the company can
charge if it sells 
units. Then 
is called the demand function (or price function)
and we would expect it to be a decreasing function of . If 
units are sold and the
price per unit is 
, then the total revenue is
and 
is called the revenue function. The derivative 
of the revenue function 
is called the marginal revenue function and is the rate of change of revenue with
respect to the number of units sold.
If units are sold, then the total proﬁt is
and 
is called the proﬁt function. The marginal proﬁt function is , the derivative
of the proﬁt function. In Exercises 43– 48 you are asked to use the marginal cost, rev-
enue, and proﬁt functions to minimize costs and maximize revenues and proﬁts.
EXAMPLE 6 A store has been selling 200 DVD burners a week at 
each. 
A market survey indicates that for each 
rebate offered to buyers, the number of
units sold will increase by 20 a week. Find the demand function and the revenue
function. How large a rebate should the store offer to maximize its revenue?
SOLUTION If is the number of DVD burners sold per week, then the weekly
increase in sales is 
. For each increase of 20 units sold, the price is
decreased by 
. So for each additional unit sold, the decrease in price will 
be 
and the demand function is
The revenue function is
Since 
, we see that 
when 
. This value of gives
an absolute maximum by the First Derivative Test (or simply by observing that the
graph of 
is a parabola that opens downward). The corresponding price is
and the rebate is 
. So to maximize revenue, the store should offer
a rebate of 
.

NEWTON’S METHOD
Suppose that a car dealer offers to sell you a car for $18,000 or for payments of $375
per month for ﬁve years. You would like to know what monthly interest rate the dealer
is, in effect, charging you. To ﬁnd the answer, you have to solve the equation
(The details are explained in Exercise 29.) How would you solve such an equation?
For a quadratic equation 
there is a well-known formula for the
roots. For third- and fourth-degree equations there are also formulas for the roots, but
they are extremely complicated. If f is a polynomial of degree 5 or higher, there is no
such formula. Likewise, there is no formula that will enable us to ﬁnd the exact roots
of a transcendental equation such as 
.
We can ﬁnd an approximate solution to Equation 1 by plotting the left side of the
equation. Using a graphing device, and after experimenting with viewing rectangles,
we produce the graph in Figure 1.
We see that in addition to the solution x  0, which doesn’t interest us, there is a
solution between 0.007 and 0.008. Zooming in shows that the root is approximately
0.0076. If we need more accuracy we could zoom in repeatedly, but that becomes tire-
some. A faster alternative is to use a numerical rootﬁnder on a calculator or computer
algebra system. If we do so, we ﬁnd that the root, correct to nine decimal places, is
0.007628603.
How do those numerical rootﬁnders work? They use a variety of methods, but 
most of them make some use of Newton’s method, which is also called the Newton-
Raphson method. We will explain how this method works, partly to show what hap-
pens inside a calculator or computer, and partly as an application of the idea of linear
approximation.
The geometry behind Newton’s method is shown in Figure 2, where the root that
we are trying to ﬁnd is labeled . We start with a ﬁrst approximation 
, which is
obtained by guessing, or from a rough sketch of the graph of , or from a computer-
generated graph of f. Consider the tangent line 
to the curve 
at the point
and look at the -intercept of , labeled 
. The idea behind Newton’s
method is that the tangent line is close to the curve and so its x-intercept, 
, is close
to the x-intercept of the curve (namely, the root r that we are seeking). Because the
tangent is a line, we can easily ﬁnd its x-intercept.
To ﬁnd a formula for 
in terms of 
we use the fact that the slope of L is 
,
so its equation is
Since the -intercept of 
is 
, we set 
and obtain
If 
, we can solve this equation for 
:
We use 
as a second approximation to r.

Next we repeat this procedure with

If we keep repeating this process, we obtain a sequence of approximations
as shown in Figure 3. In general, if the th approximation is 
and
, then the next approximation is given by
If the numbers 
become closer and closer to as 
becomes large, then we say
that the sequence converges to and we write
| Although the sequence of successive approximations converges to the desired root for
functions of the type illustrated in Figure 3, in certain circumstances the sequence may
not converge. For example, consider the situation shown in Figure 4. You can see that

is close
to 0. It might even happen that an approximation (such as 
in Figure 4) falls outside
the domain of . Then Newton’s method fails and a better initial approximation
should be chosen. See Exercises 23–25 for speciﬁc examples in which Newton’s
method works very slowly or does not work at all.

It turns out that this third approximation 
is accurate to four decimal
places.
■
Suppose that we want to achieve a given accuracy, say to eight decimal places,
using Newton’s method. How do we know when to stop? The rule of thumb that 
is generally used is that we can stop when successive approximations 
and 
agree to eight decimal places. (A precise statement concerning accuracy in Newton’s
method will be given in Exercise 29 in Section 8.8.)
Notice that the procedure in going from 
to 
is the same for all values of .
(It is called an iterative process.) This means that Newton’s method is particularly
convenient for use with a programmable calculator or a computer.
EXAMPLE 2 Use Newton’s method to ﬁnd 
correct to eight decimal places.
SOLUTION First we observe that ﬁnding 
is equivalent to ﬁnding the positive
root of the equation
so we take 
. Then 
and Formula 2 (Newton’s method)
becomes
If we choose 
as the initial approximation, then we obtain
Since 
and 
agree to eight decimal places, we conclude that
to eight decimal places.

EXAMPLE 3 Find, correct to six decimal places, the root of the equation

Therefore we let

In order to guess a suitable value for 
we sketch the graphs of

in Figure 6. It appears that they intersect at a point whose -coordinate is
somewhat less than 1, so let’s take 
as a convenient ﬁrst approximation. Then,
remembering to put our calculator in radian mode, we get
Since

agree to six decimal places (eight, in fact), we conclude that the root
of the equation, correct to six decimal places, is 
.
■
Instead of using the rough sketch in Figure 6 to get a starting approximation for
Newton’s method in Example 3, we could have used the more accurate graph that a
calculator or computer provides. Figure 7 suggests that we use 
as the initial
approximation. Then Newton’s method gives
and so we obtain the same answer as before, but with one fewer step.

ANTIDERIVATIVES
A physicist who knows the velocity of a particle might wish to know its position at a
given time. An engineer who can measure the variable rate at which water is leaking
from a tank wants to know the amount leaked over a certain time period. A biologist
who knows the rate at which a bacteria population is increasing might want to deduce
what the size of the population will be at some future time. In each case, the problem
is to ﬁnd a function 
whose derivative is a known function . If such a function
exists, it is called an antiderivative of .
DEFINITION A function 
is called an antiderivative of 
on an interval if
for all in .
For instance, let 
. It isn’t difﬁcult to discover an antiderivative of 
if we
keep the Power Rule in mind. In fact, if 
, then 
. But the
function 
also satisﬁes 
. Therefore both 
and 
are
antiderivatives of . Indeed, any function of the form 
, where 
is a
constant, is an antiderivative of . The question arises: Are there any others?
To answer this question, recall that in Section 3.2 we used the Mean Value Theorem
to prove that if two functions have identical derivatives on an interval, then they must
differ by a constant (Corollary 3.2.7). Thus if 
and 
are any two antiderivatives of
, then
so 
, where 
is a constant. We can write this as 
,
so we have the following result.
THEOREM If 
is an antiderivative of 
on an interval , then the most
general antiderivative of 
on is
where 
is an arbitrary constant.

Going back to the function 
, we see that the general antiderivative of 
is
. By assigning speciﬁc values to the constant , we obtain a family of func-
tions whose graphs are vertical translates of one another (see Figure 1). This makes
sense because each curve must have the same slope at any given value of .
EXAMPLE 1 Find the most general antiderivative of each of the following functions.
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
SOLUTION
(a) If 
, then 
, so an antiderivative of 
is 
. By
Theorem 1, the most general antiderivative is 
.
(b)
Thus the general antiderivative of 
is
This is valid for 
because then 
is deﬁned on an interval.
(c) If we put 
in part (b) we get the particular antiderivative
by the same calculation. But notice that 
is not deﬁned
at 
. Thus Theorem 1 tells us only that the general antiderivative of 
is
on any interval that does not contain 0. So the general antiderivative
of 
is
■
As in Example 1, every differentiation formula, when read from right to left, gives
rise to an antidifferentiation formula. In Table 2 we list some particular antideriva-
tives. Each formula in the table is true because the derivative of the function in the
right column appears in the left column. In particular, the ﬁrst formula says that the
antiderivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the antiderivative of
the function. The second formula says that the antiderivative of a sum is the sum of
the antiderivatives. (We use the notation 
, 
.)

In applications of calculus it is very common to have a situation as in Example 2,
where it is required to ﬁnd a function, given knowledge about its derivatives. An equa-
tion that involves the derivatives of a function is called a differential equation. These
will be studied in some detail in Section 7.7, but for the present we can solve some
elementary differential equations. The general solution of a differential equation
involves an arbitrary constant (or constants) as in Example 2. However, there may be
some extra conditions given that will determine the constants and therefore uniquely
specify the solution.

RECTILINEAR MOTION
Antidifferentiation is particularly useful in analyzing the motion of an object moving
in a straight line. Recall that if the object has position function 
, then the
velocity function is 
. This means that the position function is an anti-
derivative of the velocity function. Likewise, the acceleration function is 
,
so the velocity function is an antiderivative of the acceleration. If the acceleration and
the initial values 
and 
are known, then the position function can be found by
antidifferentiating twice.
EXAMPLE 5 A particle moves in a straight line and has acceleration given by
. Its initial velocity is 
cms and its initial displacement is
cm. Find its position function 
.
SOLUTION Since 
, antidifferentiation gives
Note that

■
An object near the surface of the earth is subject to a gravitational force that pro-
duces a downward acceleration denoted by . For motion close to the ground we may
assume that is constant, its value being about 
ms (or 
fts ).

EXAMPLE 6 A ball is thrown upward with a speed of 
fts from the edge of a
cliff 
ft above the ground. Find its height above the ground seconds later. When
does it reach its maximum height? When does it hit the ground?
SOLUTION The motion is vertical and we choose the positive direction to be
upward. At time the distance above the ground is 
and the velocity 
is
decreasing. Therefore the acceleration must be negative and we have
Taking antiderivatives, we have
To determine 
we use the given information that 
. This gives
, so
The maximum height is reached when 
, that is, after 
s. Since 
,
we antidifferentiate again and obtain
Using the fact that 
, we have 
and so
The expression for
is valid until the ball hits the ground. This happens when
, that is, when
or, equivalently,
Using the quadratic formula to solve this equation, we get
We reject the solution with the minus sign since it gives a negative value for .
Therefore the ball hits the ground after 
s.

4.1
AREAS AND DISTANCES
In this section we discover that in trying to ﬁnd the area under a curve or the distance 
traveled by a car, we end up with the same special type of limit.
THE AREA PROBLEM
We begin by attempting to solve the area problem: Find the area of the region 
that
lies under the curve 
from to . This means that , illustrated in Figure 1, is
bounded by the graph of a continuous function 
[where 
], the vertical lines
and 
, and the -axis.
In trying to solve the area problem we have to ask ourselves: What is the meaning
of the word area? This question is easy to answer for regions with straight sides. For
a rectangle, the area is deﬁned as the product of the length and the width. The area of
a triangle is half the base times the height. The area of a polygon is found by dividing
it into triangles (as in Figure 2) and adding the areas of the triangles.
However, it isn’t so easy to ﬁnd the area of a region with curved sides. We all have
an intuitive idea of what the area of a region is. But part of the area problem is to make
this intuitive idea precise by giving an exact deﬁnition of area.
Recall that in deﬁning a tangent we ﬁrst approximated the slope of the tangent line
by slopes of secant lines and then we took the limit of these approximations. We pur-
sue a similar idea for areas. We ﬁrst approximate the region 
by rectangles and then
we take the limit of the areas of these rectangles as we increase the number of rect-
angles. The following example illustrates the procedure.
EXAMPLE 1 Use rectangles to estimate the area under the parabola 
from
0 to 1 (the parabolic region S illustrated in Figure 3).
SOLUTION We ﬁrst notice that the area of S must be somewhere between 0 and 1
because 
is contained in a square with side length 1, but we can certainly do better

INTEGRALS
In Chapter 2 we used the tangent and velocity problems to introduce the derivative, which is the cen-
tral idea in differential calculus. In much the same way, this chapter starts with the area and distance
problems and uses them to formulate the idea of a definite integral, which is the basic concept of inte-
gral calculus. We will see in Chapter 7 how to use the integral to solve problems concerning volumes,
lengths of curves, work, forces on a dam, and centers of mass, among many others.
There is a connection between integral calculus and differential calculus. The Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus relates the integral to the derivative, and we will see in this chapter that it greatly simplifies
the solution of many problems.

than that. Suppose we divide S into four strips 
, 
, 
, and 
by drawing the ver-
tical lines 
, 
, and 
as in Figure 4(a).
We can approximate each strip by a rectangle whose base is the same as the strip
and whose height is the same as the right edge of the strip [see Figure 4(b)]. In other
words, the heights of these rectangles are the values of the function 
at the
right endpoints of the subintervals 
, 
, 
, and 
.
Each rectangle has width and the heights are 
, 
, 
, and 
. If we let
be the sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles, we get
From Figure 4(b) we see that the area A of S is less than 
, so
Instead of using the rectangles in Figure 4(b) we could use the smaller rectangles
in Figure 5 whose heights are the values of 
at the left endpoints of the subintervals.
(The leftmost rectangle has collapsed because its height is 0.) The sum of the areas
of these approximating rectangles is
We see that the area of S is larger than 
, so we have lower and upper estimates 
for A:
We can repeat this procedure with a larger number of strips. Figure 6 shows what
happens when we divide the region S into eight strips of equal width.

By computing the sum of the areas of the smaller rectangles 
and the sum of
the areas of the larger rectangles 
, we obtain better lower and upper estimates
for A:
So one possible answer to the question is to say that the true area of S lies some-
where between 0.2734375 and 0.3984375.
We could obtain better estimates by increasing the number of strips. The table 
at the left shows the results of similar calculations (with a computer) using n rect-
angles whose heights are found with left endpoints 
or right endpoints 
. 
In particular, we see by using 50 strips that the area lies between 0.3234 and 
0.3434. With 1000 strips we narrow it down even more: A lies between 0.3328335
and 0.3338335. A good estimate is obtained by averaging these numbers:
.
■
From the values in the table in Example 1, it looks as if 
is approaching as n
increases. We conﬁrm this in the next example.
EXAMPLE 2 For the region S in Example 1, show that the sum of the areas of
the upper approximating rectangles approaches , that is,
SOLUTION
is the sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 7. Each rectangle
has width 
and the heights are the values of the function 
at the points
; that is, the heights are 
.
Thus
Here we need the formula for the sum of the squares of the ﬁrst n positive integers:
Perhaps you have seen this formula before. It is proved in Example 5 in Appendix B.

It can be shown that the lower approximating sums also approach , that is,

better approximations to the area of S. Therefore we deﬁne the area A to be the limit

Let’s apply the idea of Examples 1 and 2 to the more general region S of Figure 1.

Figure 12 shows this approximation for n  2, 4, 8, and 12. Notice that this approx-
imation appears to become better and better as the number of strips increases, that is,
as 
. Therefore we deﬁne the area A of the region S in the following way.
DEFINITION The area A of the region S that lies under the graph of the 
continuous function
is the limit of the sum of the areas of approximating
rectangles:
It can be proved that the limit in Deﬁnition 2 always exists, since we are assuming
that 
is continuous. It can also be shown that we get the same value if we use left
endpoints:
In fact, instead of using left endpoints or right endpoints, we could take the height of
the ith rectangle to be the value of f at any number 
in the ith subinterval 
.
We call the numbers 
, 
, . . . , 
the sample points. Figure 13 shows approxi-
mating rectangles when the sample points are not chosen to be endpoints. So a more
general expression for the area of S is
NOTE It can be shown that an equivalent deﬁnition of area is the following: 
is
the unique number that is smaller than all the upper sums and bigger than all the
lower sums. We saw in Examples 1 and 2, for instance, that the area 
is trapped
between all the left approximating sums 
and all the right approximating sums 
.
The function in those examples, 
, happens to be increasing on 
and so
the lower sums arise from left endpoints and the upper sums from right endpoints.
(See Figures 8 and 9.) In general, we form lower (and upper) sums by choosing the

We often use sigma notation to write sums with many terms more compactly. For
instance,
So the expressions for area in Equations 2, 3, and 4 can be written as follows:

THE DISTANCE PROBLEM
Now let’s consider the distance problem: Find the distance traveled by an object dur-
ing a certain time period if the velocity of the object is known at all times. (In a sense
this is the inverse problem of the velocity problem that we discussed in Section 2.1.)
If the velocity remains constant, then the distance problem is easy to solve by means
of the formula
But if the velocity varies, it’s not so easy to ﬁnd the distance traveled. We investigate
the problem in the following example.
EXAMPLE 4 Suppose the odometer on our car is broken and we want to estimate
the distance driven over a 30-second time interval. We take speedometer readings
every ﬁve seconds and record them in the following table:

In order to have the time and the velocity in consistent units, let’s convert the veloc-
ity readings to feet per second (1 mih  52803600 fts):
During the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds the velocity doesn’t change very much, so we can esti-
mate the distance traveled during that time by assuming that the velocity is constant.
If we take the velocity during that time interval to be the initial velocity (25 fts),
then we obtain the approximate distance traveled during the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds:
Similarly, during the second time interval the velocity is approximately constant and
we take it to be the velocity when t  5 s. So our estimate for the distance traveled
from 
to 
is
If we add similar estimates for the other time intervals, we obtain an estimate for the
total distance traveled:
We could just as well have used the velocity at the end of each time period
instead of the velocity at the beginning as our assumed constant velocity. Then our
estimate becomes
If we had wanted a more accurate estimate, we could have taken velocity readings
every two seconds, or even every second.
■
Perhaps the calculations in Example 4 remind you of the sums we used earlier to
estimate areas. The similarity is explained when we sketch a graph of the velocity
function of the car in Figure 16 and draw rectangles whose heights are the initial
velocities for each time interval. The area of the ﬁrst rectangle is 
,
which is also our estimate for the distance traveled in the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds. In fact, the
area of each rectangle can be interpreted as a distance because the height represents
velocity and the width represents time. The sum of the areas of the rectangles in 
Figure 16 is 
, which is our initial estimate for the total distance traveled.
In general, suppose an object moves with velocity 
, where 
and
(so the object always moves in the positive direction). We take velocity read-
ings at times 
so that the velocity is approximately constant
on each subinterval. If these times are equally spaced, then the time between consecu-
tive readings is 
. During the ﬁrst time interval the velocity is approxi-
mately 
and so the distance traveled is approximately 
. Similarly, the 
distance traveled during the second time interval is about 
and the total dis-

tance traveled during the time interval 
is approximately
If we use the velocity at right endpoints instead of left endpoints, our estimate for the
total distance becomes
The more frequently we measure the velocity, the more accurate our estimates
become, so it seems plausible that the exact distance d traveled is the limit of such
expressions:
We will see in Section 4.3 that this is indeed true.
Because Equation 5 has the same form as our expressions for area in Equations 2
and 3, it follows that the distance traveled is equal to the area under the graph of 
the velocity function. In Chapter 7 we will see that other quantities of interest in the
natural and social sciences—such as the work done by a variable force—can also be
interpreted as the area under a curve. So when we compute areas in this chapter, bear
in mind that they can be interpreted in a variety of practical ways.

THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
We saw in Section 4.1 that a limit of the form
arises when we compute an area. We also saw that it arises when we try to ﬁnd the
distance traveled by an object. It turns out that this same type of limit occurs in a wide
variety of situations even when 
is not necessarily a positive function. Here we con-
sider limits similar to 
but in which 
need not be positive or continuous and the
subintervals don’t necessarily have the same length.

In general, we start with any function 
deﬁned on 
and we divide 
into
smaller subintervals by choosing partition points 
so that
The resulting collection of subintervals
is called a partition
of 
. We use the notation 
for the length of the 
sub-
interval 
. Thus
Then we choose sample points
in the subintervals with 
in the
subinterval 
. These sample points could be left endpoints or right endpoints
or any numbers between the endpoints. Figure 1 shows an example of a partition and
sample points.
A Riemann sum associated with a partition 
and a function 
is constructed by
evaluating 
at the sample points, multiplying by the lengths of the corresponding sub-
intervals, and adding:
The geometric interpretation of a Riemann sum is shown in Figure 2. Notice that if
is negative, then 
is negative and so we have to subtract the area of the
corresponding rectangle.
If we imagine all possible partitions of 
and all possible choices of sample
points, we can think of taking the limit of all possible Riemann sums as 
becomes
large by analogy with the deﬁnition of area. But because we are now allowing subin-
tervals with different lengths, we need to ensure that all of these lengths 
approach 0.

CHAPTER 4
INTEGRALS
We can do that by insisting that the largest of these lengths, which we denote by
, approaches 0. The result is called the deﬁnite integral of
from 
to .
DEFINITION OF A DEFINITE INTEGRAL If 
is a function deﬁned on 
,
the deﬁnite integral of f from a to b is the number
provided that this limit exists. If it does exist, we say that
is integrable
on
.
The precise meaning of the limit that deﬁnes the integral in Deﬁnition 2 is as follows:
means that for every 
there is a corresponding number 
such that
for all partitions 
of 
with 
and for all possible choices of 
in 
.
This means that a deﬁnite integral can be approximated to within any desired degree
of accuracy by a Riemann sum.
NOTE 1 The symbol was introduced by Leibniz and is called an integral sign. It
is an elongated 
and was chosen because an integral is a limit of sums. In the nota-
tion 
is called the integrand and 
and 
are called the limits of inte-
gration; 
is the lower limit and 
is the upper limit. For now, the symbol 
has 
no ofﬁcial meaning by itself; 
is all one symbol. The 
simply indicates 
that the independent variable is . The procedure of calculating an integral is called
integration.
NOTE 2 The deﬁnite integral 
is a number; it does not depend on . In 
fact, we could use any letter in place of 
without changing the value of the integral:
We have deﬁned the deﬁnite integral for an integrable function, but not all func-
tions are integrable. The following theorem shows that the most commonly occurring
functions are in fact integrable. The theorem is proved in more advanced courses.
THEOREM If 
is continuous on 
, or if 
has only a ﬁnite number of
jump discontinuities, then 
is integrable on 
; that is, the deﬁnite integral
exists.
If 
is integrable on 
, then the Riemann sums in Deﬁnition 2 must approach
as 
no matter how the partitions and sample points are chosen.
So in calculating the value of an integral we are free to choose partitions 
and

■RIEMANN
Bernhard Riemann received his Ph.D.
under the direction of the legendary 
Gauss at the University of Göttingen and
remained there to teach. Gauss, who 
was not in the habit of praising other
mathematicians, spoke of Riemann’s 
“creative, active, truly mathematical mind
and gloriously fertile originality.” The 
deﬁnition 
of an integral that we use is
due to Riemann. He also made major con-
tributions to the theory of functions of a
complex variable, mathematical physics,
number theory, and the foundations of
geometry. Riemann’s broad concept of
space and geometry turned out to be the
right setting, 50 years later, for Einstein’s
general relativity theory. Riemann’s health
was poor throughout his life, and he died
of tuberculosis at the age of 39.

Later, when we apply the deﬁnite integral to physical situations, it will be impor-
tant to recognize limits of sums as integrals, as we did in Example 1. When Leibniz

ing process. In general, when we write

NOTE 3 If 
happens to be positive, then the Riemann sum can be interpreted as a
sum of areas of approximating rectangles (see Fig ure 3). By comparing Theorem 4
with the deﬁnition of area in Section 4.1, we see that the deﬁnite integral
can be interpreted as the area under the curve 
from a to b. (See Figure 4.)
If 
takes on both positive and negative values, as in Figure 5, then the Riemann
sum is the sum of the areas of the rectangles that lie above the -axis and the nega-
tives of the areas of the rectangles that lie below the -axis (the areas of the dark blue
rectangles minus the areas of the light blue rectangles). When we take the limit of such
Riemann sums, we get the situation illustrated in Figure 6. A deﬁnite integral can be
interpreted as a net area, that is, a difference of areas:
where 
is the area of the region above the -axis and below the graph of , and
is the area of the region below the -axis and above the graph of .
EVALUATING INTEGRALS
When we use the deﬁnition or Theorem 4 to evaluate a deﬁnite integral, we need to
know how to work with sums. The following three equations give formulas for sums
of powers of positive integers. Equation 5 may be familiar to you from a course in
algebra. Equations 6 and 7 were discussed in Section 4.1 and are proved in Appendix B.

shows that the graph of

pute the integral as the difference of the areas of the two triangles:

THE MIDPOINT RULE
We often choose the sample point 
to be the right endpoint of the th subinterval
because it is convenient for computing the limit. But if the purpose is to ﬁnd an
approximation to an integral, it is usually better to choose 
to be the midpoint of the
interval, which we denote by . Any Riemann sum is an approximation to an integral,
but if we use midpoints and a regular partition we get the following approximation.
MIDPOINT RULE

At the moment we don’t know how accurate the approximation in Example 4 is,
but in Section 6.5 we will learn a method for estimating the error involved in using the
Midpoint Rule. At that time we will discuss other methods for approximating deﬁnite
integrals.
If we apply the Midpoint Rule to the integral in Example 2, we get the picture in
Fig ure 13. The approximation 
is much closer to the true value
than the right endpoint approximation, 
, shown in Figure 9.
PROPERTIES OF THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
We now develop some basic properties of integrals that will help us to evaluate inte-
grals in a simple manner. We assume that
and are integrable functions.
When we deﬁned the deﬁnite integral 
, we implicitly assumed that 
.
But the deﬁnition as a limit of Riemann sums makes sense even if 
. Notice that
if we reverse a and b in Theorem 4, then 
changes from 
to 
.
Therefore
If

Property 1 says that the integral of a constant function 
is the constant
times the length of the interval. If 
and 
, this is to be expected because
is the area of the shaded rectangle in Figure 14.
Property 2 says that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. For positive
functions it says that the area under 
is the area under 
plus the area under t.
Figure 15 helps us understand why this is true: In view of how graphical addition
works, the corresponding vertical line segments have equal height.
In general, Property 2 follows from Theorem 4 and the fact that the limit of a sum
is the sum of the limits:
Property 3 can be proved in a similar manner and says that the integral of a con-
stant times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. In other words,
a constant (but only a constant) can be taken in front of an integral sign. Property 4 is
proved by writing 
and using Properties 2 and 3 with 
.
EXAMPLE 5 Use the properties of integrals to evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Using Properties 2 and 3 of integrals, we have
We know from Property 1 that
and we found in Example 2 in Section 4.1 that 
. So

The next property tells us how to combine integrals of the same function over adja-
cent intervals:

■Property 3 seems intuitively reason-
able because we know that multiplying

shrinks each approximating rectangle by
a factor and therefore it has the effect
of multiplying the area by .c

EVALUATING DEFINITE INTEGRALS
In Section 4.2 we computed integrals from the deﬁnition as a limit of Riemann sums
and we saw that this procedure is sometimes long and difﬁcult. Sir Isaac Newton dis-
covered a much simpler method for evaluating integrals and a few years later Leibniz
made the same discovery. They realized that they could calculate 
if they
happened to know an antiderivative 
of . Their discovery, called the Evaluation The-
orem, is part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which is discussed in the next
section.

Theorem.
EVALUATION THEOREM If 
is continuous on the interval 
, then
where 
is any antiderivative of , that is, 
.
This theorem states that if we know an antiderivative 
of , then we can evaluate
simply by subtracting the values of 
at the endpoints of the interval 
.
It is very surprising that 
, which was deﬁned by a complicated procedure
involving all of the values of 
for 
, can be found by knowing the values
of 
at only two points, 
and .
For instance, we know from Section 3.7 that an antiderivative of 
is
, so the Evaluation Theorem tells us that 
Comparing this method with the calculation in Example 2 in Section 4.1, where we
found the area under the parabola 
from 0 to 1 by computing a limit of sums,
we see that the Evaluation Theorem provides us with a simple and powerful method.
Although the Evaluation Theorem may be surprising at ﬁrst glance, it becomes
plausible if we interpret it in physical terms. If 
is the velocity of an object and 
is its position at time t, then 
, so s is an antiderivative of . In Section
4.1 we considered an object that always moves in the positive direction and made 
the guess that the area under the velocity curve is equal to the distance traveled. In 
symbols:
That is exactly what the Evaluation Theorem says in this context.
PROOF OF THE EVALUATION THEOREM We divide the interval 
into 
subin-
tervals with endpoints 
, , 
, 
and with length 
.
Let 
be any antiderivative of . By subtracting and adding like terms, we can
express the total difference in the 
values as the sum of the differences over the
subintervals:
Now 
is continuous (because it’s differentiable) and so we can apply the Mean
Value Theorem to 
on each subinterval 
. Thus there exists a number
between 
and 
such that

Therefore
Now we take the limit of each side of this equation as 
. The left side is a
constant and the right side is a Riemann sum for the function , so
When applying the Evaluation Theorem we use the notation
and so we can write
Other common notations are

Theorem as follows:

EXAMPLE 2 Find the area under the cosine curve from 
to , where

SOLUTION Since an antiderivative of 
is 
, we have
In particular, taking 
, we have proved that the area under the cosine
curve from 0 to 
is 
. (See Figure 1.)
■
When the French mathematician Gilles de Roberval ﬁrst found the area under the
sine and cosine curves in 1635, this was a very challenging problem that required a
great deal of ingenuity. If we didn’t have the beneﬁt of the Evaluation Theorem, we
would have to compute a difﬁcult limit of sums using obscure trigonometric identities
(or a computer algebra system as in Exercise 23 in Section 4.1). It was even more dif-
ﬁcult for Roberval because the apparatus of limits had not been invented in 1635. But
in the 1660s and 1670s, when the Evaluation Theorem was discovered by Newton and
Leibniz, such problems became very easy, as you can see from Example 2.
INDEFINITE INTEGRALS
We need a convenient notation for antiderivatives that makes them easy to work with.

integrals, the notation 
is traditionally used for an antiderivative of 
and is
called an indeﬁnite integral. Thus
means
|
You should distinguish carefully between deﬁnite and indeﬁnite integrals. A
deﬁnite integral 
is a number, whereas an indeﬁnite integral 
is a
func tion (or family of functions). The connection between them is given by the Eval-
uation Theorem: If 
is continuous on 
, then
Recall from Section 3.7 that if 
is an antiderivative of 
on an interval , then the
most general antiderivative of 
on is 
, where 
is an arbitrary constant.
For instance, the formula
is valid (on any interval that doesn’t contain 0) because 
. So an
indeﬁnite integral 
can represent either a particular antiderivative of 
or an
entire family of antiderivatives (one for each value of the constant ).
The effectiveness of the Evaluation Theorem depends on having a supply of anti-
derivatives of functions. We therefore restate the Table of Antidifferentiation Formulas
from Section 3.7, together with a few others, in the notation of indeﬁnite integrals. Any
formula can be veriﬁed by differentiating the function on the right side and ob tain ing
the integrand. For instance,
because

SOLUTION First we need to write the integrand in a simpler form by carrying out
the division:

APPLICATIONS
The Evaluation Theorem says that if 
is continuous on 
, then
where 
is any antiderivative of . This means that 
, so the equation can be
rewritten as
We know that 
represents the rate of change of 
with respect to x and
is the change in y when x changes from a to b. [Note that 
could, for
instance, increase, then decrease, then increase again. Although 
might change in
both directions, 
represents the net change in .] So we can reformulate
the Evaluation Theorem in words as follows.
NET CHANGE THEOREM The integral of a rate of change is the net change: 
This principle can be applied to all of the rates of change in the natural and social
sciences. Here are a few instances of this idea:
■
If 
is the volume of water in a reservoir at time t, then its derivative
is the rate at which water ﬂows into the reservoir at time t. So
is the change in the amount of water in the reservoir between time
and
time
.
■
If 
is the concentration of the product of a chemical reaction at time t,
then the rate of reaction is the derivative 
. So
is the change in the concentration of C from time 
to time .

If the rate of growth of a population is 
, then
is the net change in population during the time period from 
to .
(The population increases when births happen and decreases when deaths
occur. The net change takes into account both births and deaths.)
■
If an object moves along a straight line with position function 
, then its
velocity is 
, so
is the net change of position, or displacement, of the particle during the
time period from 
to . In Section 4.1 we guessed that this was true for
the case where the object moves in the positive direction, but now we have
proved that it is always true.
■
If we want to calculate the distance traveled during the time interval, we
have to consider the intervals when 
(the particle moves to the
right) and also the intervals when 
(the particle moves to the left).
In both cases the distance is computed by integrating 
, the speed.
Therefore
Figure 4 shows how both displacement and distance traveled can be inter-
preted in terms of areas under a velocity curve.
■
The acceleration of the object is 
, so
is the change in velocity from time 
to time .
EXAMPLE 7 A particle moves along a line so that its velocity at time is
(measured in meters per second).
(a) Find the displacement of the particle during the time period 
.
(b) Find the distance traveled during this time period.
SOLUTION
(a) By Equation 2, the displacement is
This means that the particle’s position at time 
is 4.5 m to the left of its posi-
tion at the start of the time period.

EXAMPLE 8 Figure 5 shows the power consumption in the city of San Francisco
for a day in September (P is measured in megawatts; t is measured in hours starting
at mid night). Estimate the energy used on that day.
SOLUTION Power is the rate of change of energy: 
. So, by the Net
Change Theorem,
is the total amount of energy used on that day. We approximate the value of the
integral using the Midpoint Rule with 12 subintervals and 
:
The energy used was approximately 15,840 megawatt-hours.

■A note on units
How did we know what units to use for energy in Example 8? The integral
is deﬁned as the limit of sums of terms of the form 
. Now 
is
measured in megawatts and 
is measured in hours, so their product is measured in
megawatt-hours. The same is true of the limit. In general, the unit of measurement for
is the product of the unit for 
and the unit for x.

SECTION 4.4  THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS
233

4.4
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is appropriately named because it establishes
a connection between the two branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral
calculus. Differential calculus arose from the tangent problem, whereas integral cal-
culus arose from a seemingly unrelated problem, the area problem. Newton’s mentor
at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), discovered that these two problems are
actually closely related. In fact, he realized that differentiation and integration are
inverse processes. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives the precise inverse
relationship between the derivative and the integral. It was Newton and Leibniz who
exploited this relationship and used it to develop calculus into a systematic mathe-
ma tical method.
The ﬁrst part of the Fundamental Theorem deals with functions deﬁned by an equa -
tion of the form
where 
is a continuous function on 
and varies between and . Observe that
depends only on , which appears as the variable upper limit in the integral. If 
is
a ﬁxed number, then the integral 
is a deﬁnite number. If we then let 
vary,
the number 
also varies and deﬁnes a function of denoted by 
.
If happens to be a positive function, then 
can be interpreted as the area under
the graph of 
from 
to , where can vary from 
to . (Think of as the “area so
far” function; see Figure 1.)
EXAMPLE 1 If 
is the function whose graph is shown in Figure 2 and
, ﬁnd the values of 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
. Then sketch
a rough graph of .
SOLUTION First we notice that 
. From Figure 3 we see that
is the area of a triangle:
To ﬁnd 
we add to

We estimate that the area under 
from 2 to 3 is about 1.3, so
For 
, 
is negative and so we start subtracting areas:
We use these values to sketch the graph of in Figure 4. Notice that, because
is positive for 
, we keep adding area for 
and so is increasing up to
, where it attains a maximum value. For 
, decreases because 
is
negative.

EXAMPLE 2 If 
, where 
and 
, ﬁnd a formula for
and calculate

SOLUTION In this case we can compute 
explicitly using the Evaluation 
Theorem:
Then
■
For the function in Example 2 notice that 
, that is 
. In other words,
if is deﬁned as the integral of 
by Equation 1, then turns out to be an antideriva-
tive of , at least in this case. And if we sketch the derivative of the function shown
in Figure 4 by estimating slopes of tangents, we get a graph like that of 
in Figure 2.
So we suspect that 
in Example 1 too.
To see why this might be generally true we consider any continuous function
with 
. Then 
can be interpreted as the area under the graph of
from 
to , as in Figure 1.
In order to compute 
from the deﬁnition of derivative we ﬁrst observe that, 
for 
is obtained by subtracting areas, so it is the area under the
graph of from to 
(the shaded area in Figure 5). For small you can see from
the ﬁgure that this area is approximately equal to the area of the rectangle with height
and width :
so
Intuitively, we therefore expect that

The fact that this is true, even when 
is not necessarily positive, is the ﬁrst part of the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

By Property 8 of integrals, we have
that is,
Since

because

and the Squeeze Theorem, that
If 
or , then Equation 4 can be interpreted as a one-sided limit. Then Theo -
rem 2.2.4 (modiﬁed for one-sided limits) shows that is continuous on 
.
Using Leibniz notation for derivatives, we can write FTC1 as
when 
is continuous. Roughly speaking, this equation says that if we ﬁrst integrate
and then differentiate the result, we get back to the original function .
EXAMPLE 3 Find the derivative of the function

SOLUTION Since

rem of Calculus gives
■
EXAMPLE 4 Although a formula of the form 
may seem like a
strange way of deﬁning a function, books on physics, chemistry, and statistics are
full of such functions. For instance, the Fresnel function
is named after the French physicist Augustin Fresnel (1788–1827), who is famous
for his works in optics. This function ﬁrst appeared in Fresnel’s theory of the 
diffraction of light waves, but more recently it has been applied to the design of
highways.
Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem tells us how to differentiate the Fresnel 
function:
This means that we can apply all the methods of differential calculus to analyze
(see Exercise 29).
Figure 7 shows the graphs of 
and the Fresnel function
. A computer was used to graph 
by computing the value of this
integral for many values of . It does indeed look as if 
is the area under the
graph of 
from 
to [until 
, when 
becomes a difference of areas].
Figure 8 shows a larger part of the graph of .
If we now start with the graph of 
in Figure 7 and think about what its derivative
should look like, it seems reasonable that 
. [For instance, 
is increasing
when 
and decreasing when 
.] So this gives a visual conﬁrmation
of Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION AS INVERSE PROCESSES
We now bring together the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem. We regard Part 1
as fundamental because it relates integration and differentiation. But the Evaluation
Theorem from Section 4.3 also relates integrals and derivatives, so we rename it as
Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem.
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS Suppose

on

, then

2.
, where 
is any antiderivative of , that is, 
We noted that Part 1 can be rewritten as
which says that if 
is integrated and the result is then differentiated, we arrive back
at the original function . In Section 4.3 we reformulated Part 2 as the Net Change
Theorem:
This version says that if we take a function , ﬁrst differentiate it, and then integrate
the result, we arrive back at the original function , but in the form 
.
Taken together, the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus say that differ-
entiation and integration are inverse processes. Each undoes what the other does.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is unquestionably the most important theo -
rem in calculus and, indeed, it ranks as one of the great accomplishments of the human
mind. Before it was discovered, from the time of Eudoxus and Archimedes to the time
of Galileo and Fermat, problems of ﬁnding areas, volumes, and lengths of curves were
so difﬁcult that only a genius could meet the challenge. But now, armed with the sys-
tematic method that Newton and Leibniz fashioned out of the Funda mental Theorem,
we will see in the chapters to come that these challenging problems are accessible to
all of us.

AVERAGE VALUE OF A FUNCTION
It’s easy to calculate the average value of ﬁnitely many numbers , , . . . , :
But how do we compute the average temperature during a day if inﬁnitely many tem-
perature readings are possible? Figure 9 shows the graph of a temperature function
, where is measured in hours and 
in C, and a guess at the average tempera-
ture, 
.
In general, let’s try to compute the average value of a function 
,
We start by dividing the interval 
into 
equal subintervals, each with length
. Then we choose points 
, . . . , 
in successive subintervals and
calculate the average of the numbers 
, . . . , 
:
(For example, if 
represents a temperature function and 
, this means that we
take temperature readings every hour and then average them.) Since 
,
we can write 
and the average value becomes
If we let 
increase, we would be computing the average value of a large number of
closely spaced values. (For example, we would be averaging temperature readings
taken every minute or even every second.) The limiting value is
by the deﬁnition of a deﬁnite integral.
Therefore we deﬁne the average value of f on the interval 
as

If 
is the temperature at time , we might wonder if there is a speciﬁc time when
the temperature is the same as the average temperature. For the temperature function
graphed in Figure 9, we see that there are two such times––just before noon and just
before midnight. In general, is there a number at which the value of a function 
is
exactly equal to the average value of the function, that is, 
? The following
theorem says that this is true for continuous functions.
THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM FOR INTEGRALS If

then there exists a number in 
such that
that is,
PROOF Let

derivatives, there is a number

But 
by FTC1. Therefore
The geometric interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is that, for
positive functions , there is a number 
such that the rectangle with base 
and
height 
has the same area as the region under the graph of 
from 
to . (See 
Figure 10 and the more picturesque interpretation in the margin note.)
EXAMPLE 7 Since 
is continuous on the interval 
, the
Mean Value Theorem for Integrals says there is a number in 
such that
In this particular case we can ﬁnd explicitly. From Example 6 we know that
, so the value of c satisﬁes
Therefore
Thus in this case there happen to be two numbers 
in the interval
that work in the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.

THE SUBSTITUTION RULE
Because of the Fundamental Theorem, it’s important to be able to ﬁnd antiderivatives.
But our antidifferentiation formulas don’t tell us how to evaluate integrals such as
To evaluate this integral our strategy is to simplify the integral by changing from the
variable x to a new variable u. Suppose that we let be the quantity under the root sign
in 
, 
. Then the differential of 
is 
. Notice that if the 
in
the notation for an integral were to be interpreted as a differential, then the differen-
tial 
would occur in 
and so, formally, without justifying our calculation, we
could write
But now we can check that we have the correct answer by using the Chain Rule to 
differentiate the ﬁnal function of Equation 2: 
In general, this method works whenever we have an integral that we can write in the
form 
. Observe that if 
, then
because, by the Chain Rule,
If we make the “change of variable” or “substitution”

tion 3 we have 
or, writing 
, we get 
Thus we have proved the following rule.
THE SUBSTITUTION RULE If 
is a differentiable function whose
range is an interval and 
is continuous on , then
Notice that the Substitution Rule for integration was proved using the Chain Rule
for differentiation. Notice also that if 
, then 
, so a way to
remember the Substitution Rule is to think of 
and 
in 
as differentials.
Thus the Substitution Rule says: It is permissible to operate with dx and du
after integral signs as if they were differentials.
EXAMPLE 1 Find 
.
SOLUTION We make the substitution 
because its differential is
, which, apart from the constant factor 4, occurs in the integral. Thus,
using 
and the Substitution Rule, we have
Notice that at the ﬁnal stage we had to return to the original variable .
■
The idea behind the Substitution Rule is to replace a relatively complicated inte-
gral by a simpler integral. This is accomplished by changing from the original vari-
able to a new variable 
that is a function of . Thus in Example 1 we replaced the
integral 
by the simpler integral 
.
The main challenge in using the Substitution Rule is to think of an appropriate sub-
stitution. You should try to choose 
to be some function in the integrand whose dif-
ferential also occurs (except for a constant factor). This was the case in Example 1. If
that is not possible, try choosing to be some complicated part of the integrand (per-
haps the inner function in a composite function). Finding the right substitution is a bit
of an art. It’s not unusual to guess wrong; if your ﬁrst guess doesn’t work, try another
substitution.

NOTE With some experience, you might be able to evaluate integrals like those in
Examples 1–4 without going to the trouble of making an explicit substitution. By rec-
ognizing the pattern in Equation 3, where the integrand on the left side is the product
of the derivative of an outer function and the derivative of the inner function, we could
work Example 1 as follows:
Similarly, the solution to Example 4 could be written like this:
DEFINITE INTEGRALS
When evaluating a deﬁnite integral by substitution, two methods are possible. One
method is to evaluate the indeﬁnite integral ﬁrst and then use the Evaluation Theorem.
For instance, using the result of Example 2, we have 
Another method, which is usually preferable, is to change the limits of integration
when the variable is changed.
THE SUBSTITUTION RULE FOR DEFINITE INTEGRALS If 
is continuous
on 
and 
is continuous on the range of 
, then
PROOF Let 
be an antiderivative of . Then, by 
, 
is an antiderivative of
and so, by the Evaluation Theorem, we have
But, applying the Evaluation Theorem a second time, we also have

See Additional Example B.
■This rule says that when using a sub-
stitution in a deﬁnite integral, we must
put everything in terms of the new vari-
able , not only and 
but also the
limits of integration. The new limits of
integration are the values of 
that cor-
respond to

Therefore
Observe that when using 
we do not return to the variable

SYMMETRY
The next theorem uses the Substitution Rule for Deﬁnite Integrals 
to simplify the
calculation of integrals of functions that possess symmetry properties.
INTEGRALS OF SYMMETRIC FUNCTIONS Suppose is continuous on 
.
(a) If
is even 
, then 
.
(b) If
is odd 
, then 
.
PROOF We split the integral in two:
In the ﬁrst integral on the far right side we make the substitution 
. Then
and when 
, 
. Therefore
and so Equation 7 becomes
(a) If 
is even, then 
so Equation 8 gives

Theorem 6 is illustrated by Figure 2. For the case where

part (a) says that the area under 
from

because of symmetry. Recall that an integral 
can be expressed as the area
above the -axis and below 
minus the area below the axis and above the
curve. Thus part (b) says the integral is 
because the areas cancel.

51. Breathing is cyclic and a full respiratory cycle from the
beginning of inhalation to the end of exhalation takes 
about 5 s. The maximum rate of air ﬂow into the lungs is
about 0.5 Ls. This explains, in part, why the function
has often been used to model the rate of
air ﬂow into the lungs. Use this model to ﬁnd the volume of
inhaled air in the lungs at time .

these calculators after weeks is

INVERSE FUNCTIONS
Exponential, Logarithmic, and 
Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The common theme that links the functions of this chapter is that they occur as pairs of inverse func-
tions. In particular, two of the most important functions that occur in mathematics and its applications
are the exponential function 
and its inverse function, the logarithmic function 
.
Here we investigate their properties, compute their derivatives, and use them to describe exponential
growth and decay in biology, physics, chemistry, and other sciences. We also study the inverses of the
trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Finally we look at a method (l’Hospital’s Rule) for computing
limits of such functions.

INVERSE FUNCTIONS
Table 1 gives data from an experiment in which a bacteria culture started with 100
bacteria in a limited nutrient medium; the size of the bacteria population was recorded
at hourly intervals. The number of bacteria 
is a function of the time : 
.
Suppose, however, that the biologist changes her point of view and becomes inter-
ested in the time required for the population to reach various levels. In other words,
she is thinking of t as a function of N. This function is called the inverse function of f,
denoted by
, and read “f inverse.” Thus 
is the time required for the 
population level to reach N. The values of 
can be found by reading Table 1 from
right to left or by consulting Table 2. For instance, 
because 
Not all functions possess inverses. Let’s compare the functions

(any two inputs in 
have different outputs), whereas 
does take on the same value
twice (both 2 and 3 have the same output, 4). In symbols,

Functions that share this property with

CHAPTER 5
INVERSE FUNCTIONS
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
DEFINITION A function 
is called a one-to-one function if it never takes
on the same value twice; that is,
If a horizontal line intersects the graph of 
in more than one point, then we see
from Figure 2 that there are numbers 
and 
such that 
. This means
that is not one-to-one. Therefore we have the following geometric method for deter-
mining whether a function is one-to-one.
HORIZONTAL LINE TEST
A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal
line intersects its graph more than once.
EXAMPLE 1 Is the function 
one-to-one?
SOLUTION 1 If 
, then 
(two different numbers can’t have the same
cube). Therefore, by Deﬁnition 1, 
is one-to-one.
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 3 we see that no horizontal line intersects the graph of
more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, 
is one-to-one.
■
EXAMPLE 2 Is the function 
one-to-one?
SOLUTION 1 This function is not one-to-one because, for instance,
and so 1 and 
have the same output.
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 4 we see that there are horizontal lines that intersect the
graph of more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, is not one-to-
one.
■
One-to-one functions are important because they are precisely the functions that
possess inverse functions according to the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION Let 
be a one-to-one function with domain 
and range .
Then its inverse function
has domain 
and range 
and is deﬁned by
for any in .
This deﬁnition says that if 
maps 
into , then 
maps 
back into . (If 
were not one-to-one, then 
would not be uniquely deﬁned.) The arrow diagram in

The ﬁrst cancellation equation says that if we start with , apply , and then apply
we arrive back at , where we started (see the machine diagram in Figure 7). Thus 
undoes what 
does. The second equation says that 
undoes what 
does.
For example, if 
, then 
and so the cancellation equations
become
These equations simply say that the cube function and the cube root function cancel
each other when applied in succession.
Now let’s see how to compute inverse functions. If we have a function 
and
are able to solve this equation for 
in terms of , then according to Deﬁnition 2 we
must have 
. If we want to call the independent variable , we then inter-
change and and arrive at the equation 
.
HOW TO FIND THE INVERSE FUNCTION OF A ONE-TO-ONE FUNCTION 
STEP 1
Write

STEP 2

SOLUTION According to 
, we ﬁrst write
Then we solve this equation for :
Finally, we interchange and :
Therefore the inverse function is 
.

if 
, the point 
is on the graph of 
if and only if the point 
is on
the graph of 
. But we get the point 
from 
by reﬂecting about the line
. (See Figure 8.)
Therefore, as illustrated by Figure 9:
The graph of 
is obtained by reﬂecting the graph of 
about the line 
.
EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graphs of 
and its inverse function using
the same coordinate axes.
SOLUTION First we sketch the curve 
(the top half of the parabola
, or 
) and then we reﬂect about the line 
to get the 
graph of 
. (See Figure 10.) As a check on our graph, notice that the expression
for 
is 
. So the graph of 
is the right half of the
parabola 
and this seems reasonable from Figure 10.
■
THE CALCULUS OF INVERSE FUNCTIONS
Now let’s look at inverse functions from the point of view of calculus. Suppose that
is both one-to-one and continuous. We think of a continuous function as one whose
graph has no break in it. (It consists of just one piece.) Since the graph of 
is
obtained from the graph of 
by reﬂecting about the line 
, the graph of 
has
no break in it either (see Figure 9). Thus we might expect that 
is also a continu-
ous function.

This geometrical argument does not prove the following theorem but at least it
makes the theorem plausible. A proof can be found in Appendix C.
THEOREM If 
is a one-to-one continuous function deﬁned on an interval,
then its inverse function 
is also continuous.
Now suppose that 
is a one-to-one differentiable function. Geometrically we can
think of a differentiable function as one whose graph has no corner or kink in it. We
get the graph of 
by reﬂecting the graph of 
about the line 
, so the graph of
has no corner or kink in it either. We therefore expect that 
is also differen-
tiable (except where its tangents are vertical). In fact, we can predict the value of the
derivative of 
at a given point by a geometric argument. In Figure 11 the graphs of
and its inverse 
are shown. If 
, then 
and 
is the
slope of the tangent line 
to the graph of 
at 
, which is 
. Reﬂecting in
the line 
has the effect of interchanging the - and -coordinates. So the slope of
the reﬂected line  [the tangent to the graph of at 
] is 
. Thus the slope of
is the reciprocal of the slope of , that is,
THEOREM If 
is a one-to-one differentiable function with inverse func-
tion 
and 
, then the inverse function is differentiable at 
and
PROOF Write the deﬁnition of derivative as in Equation 2.1.5:
If

5.2
THE NATURAL LOGARITHMIC FUNCTION
In this section we deﬁne the natural logarithm as an integral and then show that it
obeys the usual laws of logarithms. The Fundamental Theorem makes it easy to dif-
ferentiate this function.
DEFINITION The natural logarithmic function is the function deﬁned by
The existence of this function depends on the fact that the integral of a continuous
function always exists. If 
, then 
can be interpreted geometrically as the area
under the hyperbola 
from 
to 
. (See Figure 1.) For 
, we have
For 
,
and so 
is the negative of the area shown in Figure 2.

SOLUTION
(a) We can interpret 
as the area under the curve 
from 1 to 2. From
Figure 3 we see that this area is larger than the area of rectangle 
and smaller
than the area of trapezoid 
. Thus we have

Notice that the integral that deﬁnes

LOGARITHMIC DIFFERENTIATION
The calculation of derivatives of complicated functions involving products, quotients,
or powers can often be simpliﬁed by taking logarithms. The method used in the fol-
lowing example is called logarithmic differentiation.

Logarithms to simplify:

THE NATURAL EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION
Since 
is an increasing function, it is one-to-one and therefore has an inverse func-
tion, which we denote by 
. Thus, according to the deﬁnition of an inverse function,
and the cancellation equations are
In particular, we have
We obtain the graph of

If is any rational number, then the third law of logarithms gives
Therefore, by 
,
Thus 
whenever is a rational number. This leads us to deﬁne 
, even for
irrational values of , by the equation
In other words, for the reasons given, we deﬁne

:
Since the natural logarithm is found on scientiﬁc calculators, we can approximate
the solution to four decimal places: 
.
■
The exponential function 
is one of the most frequently occurring func-
tions in calculus and its applications, so it is important to be familiar with its graph
(Figure 2) and its properties (which follow from the fact that it is the inverse of the
natural logarithmic function).

PROOF OF LAW 1 Using the ﬁrst law of logarithms and Equation 5, we have
Since 
is a one-to-one function, it follows that 
Laws 2 and 3 are proved similarly (see Exercises 73 and 74). As we will see in
the next section, Law 3 actually holds when is any real number.
DIFFERENTIATION
The natural exponential function has the remarkable property that it is its own deriv-
ative.
PROOF The function 
is differentiable because it is the inverse function of
, which we know is differentiable with nonzero derivative. To ﬁnd its deriv-
ative, we use the inverse function method. Let 
. Then 
and, differenti-
ating this latter equation implicitly with respect to , we get
The geometric interpretation of Formula 8 is that the slope of a tangent line to 
the curve 
at any point is equal to the -coordinate of the point (see Figure 3).
This property implies that the exponential curve 
grows very rapidly (see Exer-
cise 78).

GENERAL LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
In this section we use the natural exponential and logarithmic functions to study expo-
nential and logarithmic functions with base 
.
GENERAL EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
If 
and is any rational number, then by 
and 
in Section 5.3,
Therefore, even for irrational numbers , we deﬁne
Thus, for instance,
The function 
is called the exponential function with base a. Notice that
is positive for all because 
is positive for all .
Deﬁnition 1 allows us to extend one of the laws of logarithms. We know that
when 
is rational. But if we now let 
be any real number we have,
from Deﬁnition 1,
Thus
The general laws of exponents follow from Deﬁnition 1 together with the laws of
expo nents for

The remaining proofs are left as exercises.
The differentiation formula for exponential functions is also a consequence of 
Deﬁnition 1:
PROOF
Notice that if

and Formula 4 simpliﬁes to a formula that we
already know: 
. In fact, the reason that the natural exponential function
is used more often than other exponential functions is that its differentiation formula
is simpler.

Notice from Figure 3 that as the base a gets larger, the exponential function grows
more rapidly (for 
).
Figure 4 shows how the exponential function 
compares with the power
function 
. The graphs intersect three times, but ultimately the exponential curve
grows far more rapidly than the parabola

exponent are functions, logarithmic differentiation can be used as in the following
example.

GENERAL LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS

called the logarithmic function with base a and is denoted by 
. Thus
In particular, we see that
The cancellation equations for the inverse functions 
and 
are
Figure 7 shows the case where 
. (The most important logarithmic functions
have base 
.) The fact that 
is a very rapidly increasing function for
is reﬂected in the fact that 
is a very slowly increasing function for 
.
Figure 8 shows the graphs of 
with various values of the base . Since
, the graphs of all logarithmic functions pass through the point 
.
The laws of logarithms are similar to those for the natural logarithm and can be
deduced from the laws of exponents (see Exercise 53).
The following formula shows that logarithms with any base can be expressed in

PROOF Let 
. Then, from

. Taking natural logarithms
of both sides of this equation, we get 
. Therefore
Scientiﬁc calculators have a key for natural logarithms, so Formula 6 enables us to
use a calculator to compute a logarithm with any base (as shown in the next example).
Simi larly, Formula 6 allows us to graph any logarithmic function on a graphing cal-
culator or computer (see Exercises 14–16).
EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate 
correct to six decimal places.
SOLUTION Formula 6 gives
■
Formula 6 enables us to differentiate any logarithmic function. Since 
is a con-
stant, we can differentiate as follows:

From Formula 7 we see one of the main reasons that natural logarithms (logarithms
with base ) are used in calculus: The differentiation formula is simplest when

■NOTATION FOR LOGARITHMS
Most textbooks in calculus and the 
sciences, as well as calculators, use the
notation 
for the natural logarithm
and 
for the “common logarithm,”
. In the more advanced mathe-
matical and scientiﬁc literature and 
in computer languages, however, the
notation 
usually denotes the 
natural logarithm.

EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND DECAY
In many natural phenomena, quantities grow or decay at a rate proportional to their
size. For instance, if 
is the number of individuals in a population of animals
or bacteria at time , then it seems reasonable to expect that the rate of growth 
is proportional to the population 
; that is, 
for some constant .
Indeed, under ideal conditions (unlimited environment, adequate nutrition, immunity
to disease) the mathematical model given by the equation
predicts what
actually happens fairly accurately. Another example occurs in nuclear physics where
the mass of a radioactive substance decays at a rate proportional to the mass. In chem-
istry, the rate of a unimolecular ﬁrst-order reaction is proportional to the concentration 
of the substance. In ﬁnance, the value of a savings account with continuously com-
pounded interest increases at a rate proportional to that value.
In general, if 
is the value of a quantity at time and if the rate of change of
with respect to is proportional to its size 
at any time, then
where
is a constant. Equation 1 is sometimes called the law of natural growth (if
) or the law of natural decay (if 
). It is called a differential equation
because it involves an unknown function 
and its derivative 
.
It’s not hard to think of a solution of Equation 1. This equation asks us to ﬁnd a func-
tion whose derivative is a constant multiple of itself. We have met such functions in
this chapter. Any exponential function of the form

is a constant,

We will see in Section 7.7 that any function that satsiﬁes 
must be of the
form 
. To see the signiﬁcance of the constant , we observe that
Therefore

THEOREM The only solutions of the differential equation 
are
the exponential functions
POPULATION GROWTH
What is the signiﬁcance of the proportionality constant ? In the context of population
growth, where 
is the size of a population at time , we can write
The quantity
is the growth rate divided by the population size; it is called the relative growth rate.
According to 
, instead of saying “the growth rate is proportional to population size”
we could say “the relative growth rate is constant.” Then 
says that a population
with constant relative growth rate must grow exponentially. Notice that the relative
growth rate 
appears as the coefﬁcient of 
in the exponential function 
. For
instance, if
and is measured in years, then the relative growth rate is 
and the popula-
tion grows at a relative rate of 2% per year. If the population at time 0 is 
, then the
expression for the population is
EXAMPLE 1 Use the fact that the world population was 2560 million in 1950
and 3040 million in 1960 to model the population of the world in the second half of
the 20th century. (Assume that the growth rate is proportional to the population size.)
What is the relative growth rate? Use the model to estimate the world population in
1993 and to predict the population in the year 2020.
SOLUTION We measure the time t in years and let t  0 in the year 1950. We mea-
sure the population

Since we are assuming that

The relative growth rate is about 1.7% per year and the model is
We estimate that the world population in 1993 was
The model predicts that the population in 2020 will be
The graph in Figure 1 shows that the model is fairly accurate to date (the dots repre-
sent the actual population), so the estimate for 1993 is quite reliable. But the predic-
tion for 2020 is riskier.

RADIOACTIVE DECAY
Radioactive substances decay by spontaneously emitting radiation. If 
is the mass
remaining from an initial mass 
of the substance after time , then the relative decay
rate
has been found experimentally to be constant. (Since 
is negative, the relative
decay rate is positive.) It follows that

where is a negative constant. In other words, radioactive substances decay at a rate
proportional to the remaining mass. This means that we can use 
to show that the
mass decays exponentially:
Physicists express the rate of decay in terms of half-life, the time required for half
of any given quantity to decay.
EXAMPLE 2 The half-life of radium-226 (
) is 1590 years.
(a) A sample of radium-226 has a mass of 100 mg. Find a formula for the mass 
of 
that remains after years.
(b) Find the mass after 1000 years correct to the nearest milligram.
(c) When will the mass be reduced to 30 mg?
SOLUTION
(a) Let 
be the mass of radium-226 (in milligrams) that remains after years.
Then 
and 
, so 
gives
In order to determine the value of , we use the fact that 
. Thus

Therefore
We could use the fact that 
to write the expression for

form
(b) The mass after 1000 years is 
(c) We want to ﬁnd the value of such that 
, that is,
We solve this equation for by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
Thus

NEWTON’S LAW OF COOLING
Newton’s Law of Cooling states that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional 
to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings, provided 
that this difference is not too large. (This law also applies to warming.) If we 
let 
be the temperature of the object at time and 
be the temperature of the sur-
roundings, then we can formulate Newton’s Law of Cooling as a differential equation:
where 
is a constant. This equation is not quite the same as Equation 1, so we
make the change of variable 
. Because 
is constant, we have
and so the equation becomes
We can then use 
to find an expression for , from which we can find .
EXAMPLE 3 A bottle of soda pop at room temperature (
F) is placed in a refrig-
erator where the temperature is 
F. After half an hour the soda pop has cooled 
to 
F.
(a) What is the temperature of the soda pop after another half hour?
(b) How long does it take for the soda pop to cool to 
F?
SOLUTION
(a) Let 
be the temperature of the soda after minutes. The surrounding temper-
ature is 
, so Newton’s Law of Cooling states that

So after another half hour the pop has cooled to about

CONTINUOUSLY COMPOUNDED INTEREST
EXAMPLE 4 If $1000 is invested at 6% interest, compounded annually, then after
1 year the investment is worth 
, after 2 years it’s worth
, and after years it’s worth 
. In general,
if an amount 
is invested at an interest rate 
in this example), then 
after years it’s worth 
. Usually, however, interest is compounded more
frequently, say, 
times a year. Then in each compounding period the interest rate is
and there are 
compounding periods in years, so the value of the investment
is
For instance, after 3 years at 6% interest a $1000 investment will be worth

You can see that the interest paid increases as the number of compounding periods
increases. If we let 
, then we will be compounding the interest continu-
ously and the value of the investment will be
(where 
)
But the limit in this expression is equal to the number (see Equation 5.4.9). So with
continuous compounding of interest at interest rate , the amount after years is
If we differentiate this equation, we get
which says that, with continuous compounding of interest, the rate of increase of an
investment is proportional to its size.
Returning to the example of $1000 invested for 3 years at 6% interest, we see
that with continuous compounding of interest the value of the investment will be
Notice how close this is to the amount we calculated for daily compounding,
$1197.20. But the amount is easier to compute if we use continuous compounding.

11. Scientists can determine the age of ancient objects by the
method of radiocarbon dating. The bombardment of the
upper atmosphere by cosmic rays converts nitrogen to a
radioactive isotope of carbon, C, with a half-life of about
5730 years. Vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide through the
atmosphere and animal life assimilates C through food
chains. When a plant or animal dies, it stops replacing its 
carbon and the amount of C begins to decrease through
radioactive decay. Therefore the level of radioactivity must
also decay exponentially.
A parchment fragment was discovered that had about
74% as much C radioactivity as does plant material on
the earth today. Estimate the age of the parchment.

INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Recall from Section 5.1 that the only functions that have inverse functions are one-to-
one functions. Trigonometric functions, however, are not one-to-one and so they don’t
have inverse functions. But we can make them one-to-one by restricting their domains
and we will see that the inverses of these restricted trigonometric functions play a
major role in integral calculus.
You can see from Figure 1 that the sine function 
is not one-to-one (use
the Horizontal Line Test). But the function 
(see 
Figure 2), is one-to-one. The inverse function of this restricted sine function 
exists
and is denoted by 
or 
. It is called the inverse sine function or the arcsine
function.
Since the deﬁnition of an inverse function says that
we have

is continuous, so the inverse sine function is also
continuous. We also know from Section 2.3 that the sine function is differentiable, so
the inverse sine function is also differentiable. We could calculate the derivative of
by the formula in Theorem 5.1.7, but since we know that 
is differentiable,
we can just as easily calculate it by implicit differentiation as follows.

HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
Certain even and odd combinations of the exponential functions 
and 
arise so
frequently in mathematics and its applications that they deserve to be given special
names. In many ways they are analogous to the trigonometric functions, and they have
the same relationship to the hyperbola that the trigonometric functions have to the 
circle. For this reason they are collectively called hyperbolic functions and individu-
ally called hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, and so on. 
DEFINITION OF THE HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
The graphs of hyperbolic sine and cosine can be sketched using graphical addition
as in Figures 1 and 2.

. (See Exercise 19.)
Applications of hyperbolic functions to science and engineering occur whenever an
entity such as light, velocity, electricity, or radioactivity is gradually absorbed or
extinguished, for the decay can be represented by hyperbolic functions. The most
famous application is the use of hyperbolic cosine to describe the shape of a hanging
wire. It can be proved that if a heavy ﬂexible cable (such as a telephone or power line)
is suspended between two points at the same height, then it takes the shape of a curve
with equation 
called a catenary (see Figure 4). (The Latin word
catena means “chain.”)
Another application of hyperbolic functions occurs in the description of ocean
waves: The velocity of a water wave with length moving across a body of water with
depth 
is modeled by the function
where is the acceleration due to gravity. (See Figure 5 and Exercise 45.)
The hyperbolic functions satisfy a number of identities that are similar to well-
known trigonometric identities. We list some of them here and leave most of the
proofs to the exercises.

The identity proved in Example 1(a) gives a clue to the reason for the name “hyper-
bolic” functions:
If is any real number, the point 
lies on the unit circle
because 
. In fact, 
can be interpreted as the radian measure of
in Figure 6. For this reason the trigonometric functions are sometimes called
circular functions.
Likewise, if is any real number, then the point 
lies on the right
branch of the hyperbola 
because 
and 
.
This time, does not represent the measure of an angle. However, it turns out that
represents twice the area of the shaded hyperbolic sector in Figure 7, just as in the
trigonometric case represents twice the area of the shaded circular sector in Figure 6.
The derivatives of the hyperbolic functions are easily computed. For example,
We list the differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions as Table 1. The
remaining proofs are left as exercises. Note the analogy with the differentiation for-
mulas for trigonometric functions, but beware that the signs are different in some cases.
DERIVATIVES OF HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
EXAMPLE 2 Any of these differentiation rules can be combined with the Chain
Rule. For instance,

INVERSE HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
You can see from Figures 1 and 3 that 
and 
are one-to-one functions and so
they have inverse functions denoted by 
and 
. Figure 2 shows that 
is
not one-to-one, but when restricted to the domain 
it becomes one-to-one. The
inverse hyperbolic cosine function is deﬁned as the inverse of this restricted function.
The remaining inverse hyperbolic functions are deﬁned similarly (see Exercise 24).

5.8
INDETERMINATE FORMS AND L’HOSPITAL’S RULE
Suppose we are trying to analyze the behavior of the function
Although 
is not deﬁned when 
, we need to know how 
behaves near 1. In
particular, we would like to know the value of the limit
In computing this limit we can’t apply Law 5 of limits (the limit of a quotient is the
quotient of the limits, see Section 1.4) because the limit of the denominator is 0. In
fact, although the limit in 
exists, its value is not obvious because both numerator
and denominator approach 
and is not deﬁned.
In general, if we have a limit of the form
where both 
and 
as 
, then this limit may or may not exist and
is called an indeterminate form of type . We met some limits of this type in Chap-
ter 1. For rational functions, we can cancel common factors:
We used a geometric argument to show that
But these methods do not work for limits such as 
, so in this section we introduce
a systematic method, known as l’Hospital’s Rule, for the evaluation of indeterminate
forms.
Another situation in which a limit is not obvious occurs when we look for a hori-
zontal asymptote of F and need to evaluate the limit
It isn’t obvious how to evaluate this limit because both numerator and denominator
become large as 
. There is a struggle between numerator and denominator. 
If the numerator wins, the limit will be ; if the denominator wins, the answer will 
be 0. Or there may be some compromise, in which case the answer may be some ﬁnite
positive number.
In general, if we have a limit of the form
where both 
(or 
) and 
(or 
), then the limit may or may not

exist and is called an indeterminate form of type
. We saw in Section 1.6 that
this type of limit can be evaluated for certain functions, including rational functions,
by dividing numerator and denominator by the highest power of 
that occurs in the
denominator. For instance,
This method does not work for limits such as 
, but l’Hospital’s Rule also applies to
this type of indeterminate form.
L’HOSPITAL’S RULE Suppose 
and are differentiable and 
near
(except possibly at ). Suppose that
and    
or that
and    
(In other words, we have an indeterminate form of type or 
.) Then
if the limit on the right side exists (or is 
or 
).
NOTE 1 L’Hospital’s Rule says that the limit of a quotient of functions is equal to
the limit of the quotient of their derivatives, provided that the given conditions are sat-
isﬁed. It is especially important to verify the conditions regarding the limits of 
and
before using l’Hospital’s Rule.
NOTE 2 L’Hospital’s Rule is also valid for one-sided limits and for limits at inﬁn-
ity or negative inﬁnity; that is, “
” can be replaced by any of the symbols
,
, or 
.
NOTE 3 For the special case in which 
, 
and 
are continuous,
and 
, it is easy to see why l’Hospital’s Rule is true. In fact, using the alter-
native form of the deﬁnition of a derivative, we have
The general version of l’Hospital’s Rule is more difﬁcult; its proof can be found in
Appendix C.

■L’Hospital’s Rule is named after a
French nobleman, the Marquis de l’Hospi-
tal (1661–1704), but was discovered by a
Swiss mathematician, John Bernoulli
(1667–1748). See Exercise 49 for the
example that the Marquis used to illustrate
his rule.

Since the limit on the right side is still indeterminate of type , we apply l’Hospital’s
Rule again:
Because 
, we simplify the calculation by writing
We can evaluate this last limit either by using l’Hospital’s Rule a third time or by
writing 
as 
and making use of our knowledge of trigonometric
limits. Putting together all the steps, we get

EXAMPLE 5 Find 
.
SOLUTION If we blindly attempted to use l’Hospital’s Rule, we would get
|
This is wrong! Although the numerator 
as 
, notice that the
denominator 
does not approach , so l’Hospital’s Rule can’t be applied
here.
The required limit is, in fact, easy to ﬁnd because the function is continuous at
and the denominator is nonzero there:
■
Example 5 shows what can go wrong if you use l’Hospital’s Rule without think-
ing. Other limits can be found using l’Hospital’s Rule but are more easily found by
other methods. (See Examples 2 and 4 in Section 1.4, Example 5 in Section 1.6, and
the discussion at the beginning of this section.) So when evaluating any limit, you
should consider other methods before using l’Hospital’s Rule.

This converts the given limit into an indeterminate form of type or 
so that we
can use l’Hospital’s Rule.
EXAMPLE 6 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION The given limit is indeterminate because, as 
, the ﬁrst factor
approaches 0 while the second factor 
approaches 
. Writing 
,
we have 
as 
, so l’Hospital’s Rule gives
■
NOTE In solving Example 6 another possible option would have been to write
This gives an indeterminate form of the type 
, but if we apply l’Hospital’s Rule we
get a more complicated expression than the one we started with. In general, when we
rewrite an indeterminate product, we try to choose the option that leads to the simpler
limit.
INDETERMINATE DIFFERENCES
If 
and 
, then the limit
is called an indeterminate form of type
. Again there is a contest between
and . Will the answer be 
(
wins) or will it be 
( wins) or will they compro-
mise on a ﬁnite number? To ﬁnd out, we try to convert the difference into a quotient
(for instance, by using a common denominator, or rationalization, or factoring out a
common factor) so that we have an indeterminate form of type or 
.
EXAMPLE 7 Compute 
.
SOLUTION First notice that 
and 
as 
, so the limit
is indeterminate. Here we use a common denominator:
Note that the use of l’Hospital’s Rule is justiﬁed because

INDETERMINATE POWERS
Several indeterminate forms arise from the limit

type 
2.
and  
type 
3.
and  
type 
Each of these three cases can be treated either by taking the natural logarithm:
,  
or by writing the function as an exponential:
(Recall that both of these methods were used in differentiating such functions.) In
either method we are led to the indeterminate product 
, which is of type
.
EXAMPLE 8 Calculate 
.
SOLUTION First notice that as 
, we have 
and 
,
so the given limit is indeterminate. Let
Then
so l’Hospital’s Rule gives
So far we have computed the limit of

ﬁnd this we use the fact that

INTEGRATION BY PARTS
Every differentiation rule has a corresponding integration rule. For instance, the Sub-
stitution Rule for integration corresponds to the Chain Rule for differentiation. The
rule that corresponds to the Product Rule for differentiation is called the rule for inte-
gration by parts.
The Product Rule states that if 
and are differentiable functions, then
In the notation for indeﬁnite integrals this equation becomes

TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION
Because of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can integrate a function if we know an anti-
derivative, that is, an indefinite integral. We summarize here the most important integrals that we 
have learned so far.
,
,  
In this chapter we develop techniques for using these basic integration formulas to obtain 
indefinite integrals of more complicated functions. We learned the most important method of 
integration, the Substitution Rule, in Section 5.5. The other general technique, integration by parts, is
presented in Section 6.1. Then we learn methods that are special to particular classes of functions such
as trigonometric functions and rational functions.

Although this is true, 
is a more difﬁcult integral than the one we started
with. In general, when deciding on a choice for

to be a function that becomes simpler when differentiated (or at least not
more complicated) as long as 
can be readily integrated to give .

The integral that we have obtained,

At ﬁrst glance, it appears as if we have accomplished nothing because we have

TRIGONOMETRIC INTEGRALS AND SUBSTITUTIONS
In this section we look at integrals involving trigonometric functions and integrals that
can be transformed into trigonometric integrals by substitution.
TRIGONOMETRIC INTEGRALS
Here we use trigonometric identities to integrate certain combinations of trigo nometric
functions. We start with powers of sine and cosine.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Simply substituting 
isn’t helpful, since then 
.
In order to integrate powers of cosine, we would need an extra 
factor. Similarly,
a power of sine would require an extra 
factor. Thus here we can separate one
cosine factor and convert the remaining 
factor to an expression involving sine

We can then evaluate the integral by substituting

and
■
In general, we try to write an integrand involving powers of sine and cosine in a
form where we have only one sine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms
of cosine) or only one cosine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of
sine). The identity 
enables us to convert back and forth between
even powers of sine and cosine.
EXAMPLE 2 Find 
.
SOLUTION We could convert 
to 
, but we would be left with an
expression in terms of 
with no extra 
factor. Instead, we separate a single
sine factor and rewrite the remaining 
factor in terms of 
:
Substituting 
, we have 
and so
■
In the preceding examples, an odd power of sine or cosine enabled us to separate
a single factor and convert the remaining even power. If the integrand contains even
powers of both sine and cosine, this strategy fails. In this case, we can take advantage
of the following half-angle identities (see Equations 17b and 17a in Appendix A):
and    
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION If we write 
, the integral is no simpler to evaluate.
Using the half-angle formula for 
, however, we have
Notice that we mentally made the substitution 
when integrating 
.
Another method for evaluating this integral was given in Exercise 31 in Section 6.1.

SOLUTION We could evaluate this integral using the reduction formula for
(Equation 6.1.7) together with Example 3 (as in Exercise 31 in Section 6.1), but a
better method is to write 
and use a half-angle formula:
Since

EXAMPLE 6 Find 
.
SOLUTION If we separate a 
factor, as in the preceding example, we are left
with a 
factor, which isn’t easily converted to tangent. However, if we separate
a 
factor, we can convert the remaining power of tangent to an expression
involving only secant using the identity 
. We can then evaluate
the integral by substituting 
, so 
:
■
For other cases, the guidelines are not as clear-cut. We may need to use identities,
integration by parts, and occasionally a little ingenuity. We will sometimes need to be
able to integrate 
by using the formula established in (5.2.9):
We will also need the indeﬁnite integral of secant:
We could verify Formula 1 by differentiating the right side, or as follows. First we
multiply numerator and denominator by 
:
If we substitute 
, then

gral becomes

a function of the new one).
In general, we can make a substitution of the form 
by using the Substitu-
tion Rule in reverse. To make our calculations simpler, we assume that has an inverse
function; that is, 
is one-to-one. In this case, if we replace 
by 
and 
by in the
Substitution Rule (Equation 4.5.4), we obtain
This kind of substitution is called inverse substitution.
We can make the inverse substitution 
provided that it deﬁnes a one-to-
one function. We accomplish this by restricting 
to lie in the interval 
.
In the following table we list trigonometric substitutions that are effective for the
given radical expressions because of the speciﬁed trigonometric identities. In each case
the restriction on 
is imposed to ensure that the function that deﬁnes the substitution
is one-to-one. (These are the same intervals used in Section 5.6 in deﬁning the inverse
functions.)

PARTIAL FRACTIONS
In this section we show how to integrate any rational function (a ratio of polynomials)
by expressing it as a sum of simpler fractions, called partial fractions, that we already
know how to integrate. To illustrate the method, observe that by taking the fractions
and 
to a common denominator we obtain
If we now reverse the procedure, we see how to integrate the function on the right side
of this equation:
To see how the method of partial fractions works in general, let’s consider a rational
function

where 
and 
are polynomials. It’s possible to express 
as a sum of simpler frac-
tions provided that the degree of 
is less than the degree of . Such a rational func-
tion is called proper. Recall that if
where 
, then the degree of 
is 
and we write 
.
If 
is improper, that is, 
, then we must take the preliminary step
of dividing 
into 
(by long division) until a remainder 
is obtained such that
. The division statement is
where 
and 
are also polynomials.
As the following example illustrates, sometimes this preliminary step is all that is
required.
EXAMPLE 1 Find 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the
denominator, we ﬁrst perform the long division. This enables us to write
■
The next step is to factor the denominator 
as far as possible. It can be shown
that any polynomial 
can be factored as a product of linear factors (of the form
and irreducible quadratic factors (of the form 
, where 
).
For instance, if 
, we could factor it as
The third step is to express the proper rational function 
(from Equation 1)
as a sum of partial fractions of the form
A theorem in algebra guarantees that it is always possible to do this. We explain the
details for the four cases that occur.
CASE I The denominator 
is a product of distinct linear factors.
This means that we can write
where no factor is repeated (and no factor is a constant multiple of another). In this
case the partial fraction theorem states that there exist constants

These constants can be determined as in the following example.
EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denom-
inator, we don’t need to divide. We factor the denominator as
Since the denominator has three distinct linear factors, the partial fraction decompo-
sition of the integrand 
has the form
To determine the values of , , and , we multiply both sides of this equation by
the product of the denominators, 
, obtaining
Expanding the right side of Equation 4 and writing it in the standard form for
polyno mials, we get
The polynomials in Equation 5 are identical, so their coefﬁcients must be equal.

, must equal the coefﬁcient of
on the left side—namely, 1. Likewise, the coefﬁcients of are equal and the con-
stant terms are equal. This gives the following system of equations for , , and :

ues of that simplify the equation. If we put 
in Equation 4, then the second and
third terms on the right side vanish and the equation then becomes 
, or
. Likewise, 
gives 
and 
gives

and
. (You may object that Equation 3 is not valid for 
, , or 
, so why
should Equation 4 be valid for those values? In fact, Equation 4 is true for all values

, , and 
. See Exercise 45 for the reason.)
CASE II
is a product of linear factors, some of which are repeated.
Suppose the ﬁrst linear factor 
is repeated 
times; that is,
occurs in the factorization of 
. Then instead of the single term 
in
Equation 2, we would use
By way of illustration, we could write
but we prefer to work out in detail a simpler example.

SOLUTION The ﬁrst step is to divide. The result of long division is
The second step is to factor the denominator 
. Since
, we know that 
is a factor and we obtain
Since the linear factor 
occurs twice, the partial fraction decomposition is
Multiplying by the least common denominator, 
, we get

In order to integrate the second term we split it into two parts:
We make the substitution 
in the ﬁrst of these integrals so that
. We evaluate the second integral by means of Formula 9 with 
:
■
EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is not less than the degree of the
denominator, we ﬁrst divide and obtain
Notice that the quadratic 
is irreducible because its discriminant is
. This means it can’t be factored, so we don’t need to use the 
partial fraction technique.
To integrate the given function we complete the square in the denominator:
This suggests that we make the substitution

INTEGRATION WITH TABLES AND
COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS
In this section we describe how to evaluate integrals using tables and computer alge-
bra systems.
TABLES OF INTEGRALS
Tables of indeﬁnite integrals are very useful when we are confronted by an integral
that is difﬁcult to evaluate by hand and we don’t have access to a computer algebra
system. A relatively brief table of 120 integrals, categorized by form, is provided on
the Reference Pages at the back of the book. More extensive tables are available in
CRC Standard Mathe matical Tables and Formulae, 32nd ed, by Daniel Zwillinger
(Boca Raton, FL, 2012) (709 entries) or in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik’s Table of Inte-
grals, Series, and Products, 7e, edited by A. Jefferey and D. Zwillinger (Boston,
2007), which contains hundreds of pages of integrals. It should be remembered, how-
ever, that integrals do not often occur in exactly the form listed in a table. Usually we
need to use the Substitution Rule or algebraic manipulation to transform a given inte-
gral into one of the forms in the table.

SOLUTION If we look at the section of the table entitled Forms involving
, we see that the closest entry is number 34:
This is not exactly what we have, but we will be able to use it if we ﬁrst make the
substitution 
:
Then we use Formula 34 with

SOLUTION If we look in the section called Trigonometric Forms, we see that none
of the entries explicitly includes a

formula in entry 84 with 
:
We now need to evaluate 
. We can use the reduction formula in entry 85
with

Combining these calculations, we get

COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS
We have seen that the use of tables involves matching the form of the given integrand
with the forms of the integrands in the tables. Computers are particularly good at
matching patterns. And just as we used substitutions in conjunction with tables, a CAS
can perform substitutions that transform a given integral into one that occurs in its
stored formulas. So it isn’t surprising that computer algebra systems excel at integra-
tion. That doesn’t mean that integration by hand is an obsolete skill. We will see that
a hand computation sometimes produces an indeﬁnite integral in a form that is more
convenient than a machine answer.
To begin, let’s see what happens when we ask a machine to integrate the relatively 
simple function 
. Using the substitution 
, an easy calcula-
tion by hand gives
whereas Derive, Mathematica, and Maple all return the answer
The ﬁrst thing to notice is that computer algebra systems omit the constant of integra-
tion. In other words, they produce a particular antiderivative, not the most general
one. Therefore, when making use of a machine integration, we might have to add a
constant. Second, the absolute value signs are omitted in the machine answer. That is
ﬁne if our problem is concerned only with values of 
greater than . But if we are
interested in other values of , then we need to insert the absolute value symbol.
In the next example we reconsider the integral of Example 3, but this time we ask
a machine for the answer.

EXAMPLE 4 Use a computer algebra system to ﬁnd 
.
SOLUTION Maple responds with the answer
This looks different from the answer we found in Example 3, but it is equivalent
because the third term can be rewritten using the identity
Thus
The resulting extra term 
can be absorbed into the constant of integration.
Mathematica gives the answer
Mathematica combined the ﬁrst two terms of Example 3 (and the Maple result) into
a single term by factoring.
Derive gives the answer
The ﬁrst term is like the ﬁrst term in the Mathematica answer, and the second term
is identical to the last term in Example 3.
■
EXAMPLE 5 Use a CAS to evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Maple and Mathematica give the same answer:
It’s clear that both systems must have expanded 
by the Binomial Theorem
and then integrated each term.
If we integrate by hand instead, using the substitution 
, we get
For most purposes, this is a more convenient form of the answer.

SOLUTION In Example 2 in Section 6.2 we found that
Derive and Maple report the answer
whereas Mathematica produces
We suspect that there are trigonometric identities which show these three answers
are equivalent. Indeed, if we ask Derive, Maple, and Mathematica to simplify their
expressions using trigonometric identities, they ultimately produce the same form of
the answer as in Equation 1.

CAN WE INTEGRATE ALL CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS?
The question arises: Will our basic integration formulas, together with the Substitu-
tion Rule, integration by parts, tables of integrals, and computer algebra systems,
enable us to ﬁnd the integral of every continuous function? In particular, can we use
it to evaluate 
? The answer is No, at least not in terms of the functions that we
are familiar with.
Most of the functions that we have been dealing with in this book are what are
called elementary functions. These are the polynomials, rational functions, power
functions 
, exponential functions 
, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and
in verse trigonometric functions, and all functions that can be obtained from these by
the ﬁve operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition.
For instance, the function
is an elementary function.
If 
is an elementary function, then 
is an elementary function but 
need
not be an elementary function. Consider 
. Since 
is continuous, its integral
exists, and if we deﬁne the function 
by 
then we know from Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that
Thus 
has an antiderivative , but it can be proved that 
is not an elemen-
tary function. This means that no matter how hard we try, we will never succeed in
evaluating 
in terms of the functions we know. (In Chapter 8, however, we will
see how to express 
as an inﬁnite series.) The same can be said of the follow-

APPROXIMATE INTEGRATION
There are two situations in which it is impossible to ﬁnd the exact value of a deﬁnite 
integral.
The ﬁrst situation arises from the fact that in order to ﬁnd 
using the Eval-
uation Theorem we need to know an antiderivative of . Sometimes, however, it is dif-
ﬁcult, or even impossible, to ﬁnd an antiderivative (see Section 6.4). For example, it
is impossible to evaluate the following integrals exactly:
The second situation arises when the function is determined from a scientiﬁc exper -
iment through instrument readings or collected data. There may be no formula for the
function (see Example 5).
In both cases we need to ﬁnd approximate values of deﬁnite integrals. We already
know one such method. Recall that the deﬁnite integral is deﬁned as a limit of Rie-
mann sums, so any Riemann sum could be used as an approximation to the integral:
If we divide 
into 
subintervals of equal length 
, then we have
where 
is any point in the th subinterval 
. If 
is chosen to be the left end-
point of the interval, then 
and we have
If 
, then the integral represents an area and 
represents an approximation
of this area by the rectangles shown in Figure 1(a). If we choose 
to be the right end-
point, then 
and we have
[See Figure 1(b).] The approximations 
and 
deﬁned by Equations 1 and 2 
are called the left endpoint approximation and right endpoint approximation, 
respectively.
In Section 4.2 we also considered the case where 
is chosen to be the midpoint
of the subinterval 
. Figure 1(c) shows the midpoint approximation 
,
which appears to be better than either 
or

Another approximation, called the Trapezoidal Rule, results from averaging the
approximations in Equations 1 and 2:

and 
.
The reason for the name Trapezoidal Rule can be seen from Figure 2, which illus-
trates the case 
. The area of the trapezoid that lies above the th subinterval
is
and if we add the areas of all these trapezoids, we get the right side of the Trapezoidal
Rule.

In Example 1 we deliberately chose an integral whose value can be computed 
explicitly so that we can see how accurate the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are. 
By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
The error in using an approximation is deﬁned to be the amount that needs to be added
to the approximation to make it exact. From the values in Example 1 we see that the
errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rule approximations for 
are 
In general, we have
The following tables show the results of calculations similar to those in Example 1,
but for 
, and 
and for the left and right endpoint approximations as well
as the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules.
We can make several observations from these tables:
1. In all of the methods we get more accurate approximations when we increase
the value of . (But very large values of 
result in so many arithmetic opera-
tions that we have to beware of accumulated round-off error.)
2. The errors in the left and right endpoint approximations are opposite in sign
and appear to decrease by a factor of about 2 when we double the value of .
3. The Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are much more accurate than the end-
point approximations.
4. The errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are opposite in sign and
appear to decrease by a factor of about 4 when we double the value of .
5. The size of the error in the Midpoint Rule is about half the size of the error in
the Trapezoidal Rule.
Figure 5 (on page 350) shows why we can usually expect the Midpoint Rule to be
more accurate than the Trapezoidal Rule. The area of a typical rectangle in the Mid-
point Rule is the same as the trapezoid 
whose upper side is tangent to the graph

at . The area of this trapezoid is closer to the area under the graph than is the area of
the trapezoid 
used in the Trapezoidal Rule. [The midpoint error (shaded gray)
is smaller than the trapezoidal error (shaded blue).]
These observations are corroborated in the following error estimates, which are
proved in books on numerical analysis. Notice that Observation 4 corresponds to the
in each denominator because 
. The fact that the estimates depend on the
size of the second derivative is not surprising if you look at Figure 5, because

Let’s apply this error estimate to the Trapezoidal Rule approximation in Example 1.

Therefore, taking

Notice that, in Example 4, Simpson’s Rule gives us a much better approximation
to the true value of the integral 
than does the
Trapezoidal Rule 
or the Midpoint Rule 
. It turns
out (see Exercise 42) that the approximations in Simpson’s Rule are weighted aver-
ages of those in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules:

In many applications of calculus we need to evaluate an integral even if no explic-
it formula is known for y as a function of x. A function may be given graphically or
as a table of values of collected data. If there is evidence that the values are not chang-
ing rapidly, then the Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson’s Rule can still be used to ﬁnd an
approximate value for

■SIMPSON
Thomas Simpson was a weaver who 
taught himself mathematics and went on 
to become one of the best English mathe-
maticians of the 18th century. What we 
call Simpson’s Rule was actually known 
to Cavalieri and Gregory in the 17th cen-
tury, but Simpson popularized it in his 
best-selling calculus textbook, entitled 
A New Treatise of Fluxions.

The table in the margin shows how Simpson’s Rule compares with the Midpoint
Rule for the integral 
, whose value is about 0.69314718. The second table
shows how the error 
in Simpson’s Rule decreases by a factor of about 16 when
is doubled. (In Exercise 24 you are asked to verify this for another integral.) That is
consistent with the appearance of 
in the denominator of the following error esti-
mate for Simpson’s Rule. It is similar to the estimates given in

■Many calculators and computer 
algebra systems have a built-in algo-
rithm that computes an approximation
of a deﬁnite integral. Some of these
machines use Simpson’s Rule; others
use more sophisticated techniques such
as adaptive numerical integration. This
means that if a function ﬂuctuates much
more on a certain part of the interval
than it does elsewhere, then that part
gets divided into more sub intervals.
This strategy reduces the number of 
calculations required to achieve a pre-
scribed accuracy.
■Figure 10 illustrates the calculation
in Example 7. Notice that the parabolic
arcs are so close to the graph of 
that they are practically indistinguish-
able from it.

IMPROPER INTEGRALS
In deﬁning a deﬁnite integral 
we dealt with a function
deﬁned on a ﬁnite
interval 
. In this section we extend the concept of a deﬁnite integral to the case
where the interval is inﬁnite and also to the case where
has an inﬁnite discontinuity
in 
. In either case the integral is called an improper integral.
TYPE 1: INFINITE INTERVALS
Consider the inﬁnite region that lies under the curve 
, above the -axis, and
to the right of the line 
. You might think that, since is inﬁnite in extent, its area
must be inﬁnite, but let’s take a closer look. The area of the part of 
that lies to the
left of the line 
(shaded in Figure 1) is
Notice that 
no matter how large is chosen.
We also observe that
The area of the shaded region approaches 
as 
(see Figure 2), so we say that
the area of the inﬁnite region 
is equal to

Using this example as a guide, we deﬁne the integral of (not necessarily a posi-
tive function) over an inﬁnite interval as the limit of integrals over ﬁnite intervals.
DEFINITION OF AN IMPROPER INTEGRAL OF TYPE 1
(a) If 
exists for every number 
, then
provided this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
(b) If 
exists for every number 
, then
provided this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
The improper integrals 
and 
are called convergent if the
corresponding limit exists and divergent if the limit does not exist.
(c) If both 
and 
are convergent, then we deﬁne
In part (c) any real number 
can be used (see Exercise 52).
Any of the improper integrals in Deﬁnition 1 can be interpreted as an area provided
that 
is a positive function. For instance, in case (a) if 
and the integral
is convergent, then we deﬁne the area of the region
in Figure 3 to be
This is appropriate because 
is the limit as 
of the area under the graph

is convergent or divergent.

The limit does not exist as a ﬁnite number and so the improper integral
is divergent.

Let’s compare the result of Example 1 with the example given at the beginning of
this section:
Geometrically, this says that although the curves 
and 
look very sim-
ilar for 
, the region under 
to the right of 
(the shaded region in
Figure 4) has ﬁnite area whereas the corresponding region under 
(in Fig-
ure 5) has inﬁnite area. Note that both 
and 
approach 
as 
but
approaches faster than 
. The values of 1x don’t decrease fast enough for its inte-
gral to have a ﬁnite value.

Since both of these integrals are convergent, the given integral is convergent and
Since 
, the given improper integral can be interpreted as the area of 
the inﬁnite region that lies under the curve 
and above the -axis (see
Figure 6).

is the following integral convergent?
SOLUTION We know from Example 1 that if

so let’s assume that 
. Then
If

We summarize the result of Example 4 for future reference:
TYPE 2: DISCONTINUOUS INTEGRANDS
Suppose that is a positive continuous function deﬁned on a ﬁnite interval 
but
has a vertical asymptote at . Let be the unbounded region under the graph of and
above the -axis between 
and . (For Type 1 integrals, the regions extended indeﬁ-
nitely in a horizontal direction. Here the region is inﬁnite in a vertical direction.) The
area of the part of 
between 
and (the shaded region in Figure 7) is
If it happens that 
approaches a deﬁnite number 
as 
, then we say that
the area of the region 
is 
and we write
We use this equation to deﬁne an improper integral of Type 2 even when
is not a pos-
itive function, no matter what type of discontinuity
has at .
DEFINITION OF AN IMPROPER INTEGRAL OF TYPE 2
(a) If is continuous on 
and is discontinuous at , then 
if this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
(b) If is continuous on 
and is discontinuous at , then 
if this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
The improper integral 
is called convergent if the corresponding
limit exists and divergent if the limit does not exist.
(c) If
has a discontinuity at , where 
, and both 
and
are convergent, then we deﬁne

occurs at the left endpoint of 
, we use part (b) of Deﬁnition 3:
Thus the given improper integral is convergent and, since the integrand is posi-
tive, we can interpret the value of the integral as the area of the shaded region in
Figure 10.
■
EXAMPLE 6 Determine whether 
converges or diverges.
SOLUTION Note that the given integral is improper because 
.
Using part (a) of Deﬁnition 3 and Formula 14 from the Table of Integrals, we have
because 
and 
as 
. Thus the given improper integral is
divergent.
■
EXAMPLE 7 Evaluate 
if possible.
SOLUTION Observe that the line 
is a vertical asymptote of the integrand.
Since it occurs in the middle of the interval 
, we must use part (c) of Deﬁnition 3
with 
:
where
because 
as 
. Thus 
is divergent. This implies that
is divergent. [We do not need to evaluate 
.]

WARNING If we had not noticed the asymptote 
in Example 7 and had
instead confused the integral with an ordinary integral, then we might have made the
following erroneous calculation:
This is wrong because the integral is improper and must be calculated in terms of limits.

From now on, whenever you meet the symbol 
you must decide, by look-
ing at the function on 
, whether it is an ordinary deﬁnite integral or an improper 
integral.
A COMPARISON TEST FOR IMPROPER INTEGRALS
Sometimes it is impossible to ﬁnd the exact value of an improper integral and yet it 
is important to know whether it is convergent or divergent. In such cases the follow-
ing theorem is useful. Although we state it for Type 1 integrals, a similar theorem is
true for Type 2 integrals.
COMPARISON THEOREM Suppose that and are continuous functions with
for 
.
(a) If 
is convergent, then 
is convergent.
(b) If 
is divergent, then 
is divergent.
We omit the proof of the Comparison Theorem, but Figure 11 makes it seem plau-
sible. If the area under the top curve 
is ﬁnite, then so is the area under the
bottom curve 
. And if the area under 
is inﬁnite, then so is the area
under 
. [Note that the reverse is not necessarily true: If 
is conver-
gent, 
may or may not be convergent, and if 
is divergent,
may or may not be divergent.]
EXAMPLE 8 Show that 
is convergent.
SOLUTION We can’t evaluate the integral directly because the antiderivative of
is not an elementary function (as explained in Section 6.4). We write
and observe that the ﬁrst integral on the right-hand side is just an ordinary deﬁnite
integral. In the second integral we use the fact that for 
we have 
, so
and therefore 
. (See Figure 12.) The integral of 
is easy to
evaluate:
Thus, taking 
and 
in the Comparison Theorem, we see that
is convergent. It follows that 
is convergent.
■
In Example 8 we showed that 
is convergent without computing its value.
In Exercise 58 we indicate how to show that its value is approximately 0.8862. In
probability theory it is important to know the exact value of this improper integral;
using the methods of multivariable calculus it can be shown that the exact value is
. Table 1 illustrates the deﬁnition of an improper integral by showing how the
(computer-generated) values of 
approach 
as becomes large. In fact, 
these values converge quite quickly because 
very rapidly as

AREAS BETWEEN CURVES
In Chapter 4 we deﬁned and calculated areas of regions that lie under the graphs of 
functions. Here we use integrals to ﬁnd areas of regions that lie between the graphs of
two functions.
Consider the region 
that lies between two curves 
and 
and be-
tween the vertical lines 
and 
, where 
and are continuous functions and
for all in 
. (See Figure 1.)
Just as we did for areas under curves in Section 4.1, we divide S into n strips of
equal width and then we approximate the ith strip by a rectangle with base 
and
height 
. (See Figure 2. If we like, we could take all of the sample points
to be right endpoints, in which case 
.) The Riemann sum
is therefore an approximation to what we intuitively think of as the area of S.

APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
In this chapter we explore some of the applications of the definite integral by using it to compute areas
between curves, volumes of solids, lengths of curves, the work done by a varying force, the center of
gravity of a plate, and the force on a dam. The common theme in most of these applications is the 
following general method, which is similar to the one we used to find areas under curves: We break up
a quantity 
into a large number of small parts. We next approximate each small part by a quantity of
the form 
and thus approximate 
by a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit and express 
as an integral. Finally we evaluate the integral by using the Evaluation Theorem, or Simpson’s Rule, or
technology.
In the final section we look at what is perhaps the most important of all the applications of integra-
tion: differential equations. When a scientist uses calculus, more often than not it is to solve a differen-
tial equation that has arisen in the description of some physical process.

This approximation appears to become better and better as 
. Therefore we
deﬁne the area
of 
as the limiting value of the sum of the areas of these approxi-
mating rectangles.
We recognize the limit in 
as the deﬁnite integral of 
. Therefore we have
the following formula for area.
The area A of the region bounded by the curves 
, and
the lines 
, 
, where and are continuous and 
for all
in 
, is
Notice that in the special case where 
, 
is the region under the graph of 
and our general deﬁnition of area 
reduces to our previous deﬁnition (Deﬁni-
tion 4.1.2).
In the case where both 
and are positive, you can see from Figure 3 why 
is
true: 
EXAMPLE 1 Find the area of the region bounded above by 
, bounded below
by 
, and bounded on the sides by x  0 and x  1.
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 4. The upper boundary curve is
and the lower boundary curve is y  x. So we use the area formula 
with
, 
, 
and 
:
■
In Figure 4 we drew a typical approximating rectangle with width 
as a reminder
of the procedure by which the area is deﬁned in 
. In general, when we set up an
integral for an area, it’s helpful to sketch the region to identify the top curve

Notice that in Figure 5 the left-hand boundary reduces to a point, whereas in Fig-
ure 3 the right-hand boundary reduces to a point. In the next example both of the side
boundaries reduce to a point, so the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a and b.

EXAMPLE 3 Figure 7 shows velocity curves for two cars, A and B, that start side by
side and move along the same road. What does the area between the curves repre-
sent? Use Simpson’s Rule to estimate it.
SOLUTION We know from Section 4.3 that the area under the velocity curve A
represents the distance traveled by car A during the ﬁrst 16 seconds. Similarly, the
area under curve B is the distance traveled by car B during that time period. So the
area between these curves, which is the difference of the areas under the curves, is
the distance between the cars after 16 seconds. We read the velocities from the
graph and convert them to feet per second 
.
Using Simpson’s Rule with 
intervals, so that 
, we estimate the dis-
tance between the cars after 16 seconds:

NOTE We could have found the area in Example 4 by integrating with respect to x
instead of y, but the calculation is much more involved. It would have meant splitting
the region in two and computing the areas labeled 
and 
in Figure 11. The method
we used in Example 4 is much easier.

VOLUMES
In trying to ﬁnd the volume of a solid we face the same type of problem as in ﬁnding
areas. We have an intuitive idea of what volume means, but we must make this idea
precise by using calculus to give an exact deﬁnition of volume.
We start with a simple type of solid called a cylinder (or, more precisely, a right
cylinder). As illustrated in Figure 1(a), a cylinder is bounded by a plane region 
, 
called the base, and a congruent region 
in a parallel plane. The cylinder consists of
all points on line segments that are perpendicular to the base and join 
to 
. If the
area of the base is 
and the height of the cylinder (the distance from 
to 
) is ,
then the volume 
of the cylinder is deﬁned as
In particular, if the base is a circle with radius , then the cylinder is a circular cylinder
with volume 
[see Figure 1(b)], and if the base is a rectangle with length 
and width , then the cylinder is a rectangular box (also called a rectangular parallel-
epiped) with volume 
[see Figure 1(c)].

For a solid that isn’t a cylinder we ﬁrst “cut” into pieces and approximate each
piece by a cylinder. We estimate the volume of by adding the volumes of the cylin-
ders. We arrive at the exact volume of S through a limiting process in which the num-
ber of pieces becomes large.
We start by intersecting S with a plane and obtaining a plane region that is called a
cross-section of 
Let 
be the area of the cross-section of in a plane 
perpen-
dicular to the -axis and passing through the point , where 
. (See Figure 2.
Think of slicing 
with a knife through 
and computing the area of this slice.) The
cross-sectional area 
will vary as increases from 
to .
We consider a partition of the interval 
into 
subintervals with partition
points 
. We divide S into n “slabs” of width 
by using
the planes 
, 
, . . . to slice the solid. (Think of slicing a loaf of bread.) If we choose
sample points 
in 
, we can approximate the th slab 
(the part of that lies
between the planes 
and 
) by a cylinder with base area 
and “height” 
.

The volume of this cylinder is 
, so an approximation to our intuitive con-
ception of the volume of the th slab 
is 
Adding the volumes of these slabs, we get an approximation to the total volume (that
is, what we think of intuitively as the volume): 
This approximation appears to become better and better as the slices become thinner
and thinner. So we deﬁne the volume as the limit of these sums as 
. But
we recognize the limit of Riemann sums as a deﬁnite integral and so we have the fol-
lowing deﬁnition.
DEFINITION OF VOLUME Let 
be a solid that lies between 
and 
.
If the cross-sectional area of 
in the plane 
, through x and perpendicular to
the x-axis, is 
, where 
is an integrable function, then the volume of 
is
When we use the volume formula 
it is important to remember that 
is the area of a moving cross-section obtained by slicing through 
perpendicu-
lar to the -axis.
Notice that, for a cylinder, the cross-sectional area is constant: 
for all .
So our deﬁnition of volume gives 
; this agrees with the for-
mula 
EXAMPLE 1 Show that the volume of a sphere of radius is 
.
SOLUTION If we place the sphere so that its center is at the origin (see Figure 4),
then the plane 
intersects the sphere in a circle whose radius (from the Py thag o-
 re an Theorem) is 
. So the cross-sectional area is
Using the deﬁnition of volume with 
and 
, we have
(The integrand is even.)
■
Figure 5 illustrates the deﬁnition of volume when the solid is a sphere with radius 
. From the result of Example 1, we know that the volume of the sphere is
. Here the slabs are circular cylinders, or disks, and the three parts of

Figure 5 show the geometric interpretations of the Riemann sums

, 10, and 20 if we use regular partitions and choose the sample points
to be the midpoints . Notice that as we increase the number of approximating cylin-
ders, the corresponding Riemann sums become closer to the true volume.

the region under the curve 
from 0 to 1. Illustrate the deﬁnition of volume
by sketching a typical approximating cylinder.
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 6(a). If we rotate about the x-axis, we
get the solid shown in Figure 6(b). When we slice through the point x, we get a disk
with radius 
. The area of this cross-section is
and the volume of the approximating cylinder (a disk with thickness 
) is
The solid lies between

■Did we get a reasonable answer in 
Example 2? As a check on our work,
let’s replace the given region by a
square with base

we rotate this square, we get a cylinder
with radius , height , and volume
. We computed that the
given solid has half this volume. That
seems about right.

EXAMPLE 3 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region 
bounded by 
, 
, and 
about the -axis.
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 7(a) and the resulting solid is shown in
Figure 7(b). Because the region is rotated about the -axis, it makes sense to slice
the solid perpendicular to the -axis and therefore to integrate with respect to y. If we
slice at height , we get a circular disk with radius , where 
. So the area of
a cross-section through
is
and the volume of the approximating cylinder pictured in Figure 7(b) is
Since the solid lies between 
and 
, its volume is

EXAMPLE 4 The region 
enclosed by the curves 
and 
is rotated
about the -axis. Find the volume of the resulting solid.
SOLUTION The curves 
and 
intersect at the points 
and 
.
The region between them, the solid of rotation, and a cross-section perpendicular to
the -axis are shown in Figure 8. A cross-section in the plane 
has the shape of a
washer (an annular ring) with inner radius 
and outer radius , so we ﬁnd the
cross-sectional area by subtracting the area of the inner circle from the area of the
outer circle:
Therefore we have

solid of revolution by using the basic deﬁning formula
and we ﬁnd the cross-sectional area 
or 
in one of the following ways:
■
If the cross-section is a disk (as in Examples 1–3), we ﬁnd the radius of the
disk (in terms of x or y) and use
■
If the cross-section is a washer (as in Examples 4 and 5), we ﬁnd the inner
radius 
and outer radius 
from a sketch (as in Figures 9 and 10) and
compute the area of the washer by subtracting the area of the inner disk
from the area of the outer disk:

We now ﬁnd the volumes of two solids that are not solids of revolution.
EXAMPLE 7 Figure 12 shows a solid with a circular base of radius 1. Parallel cross-
sections perpendicular to the base are equilateral triangles. Find the volume of the
solid.
SOLUTION Let’s take the circle to be 
. The solid, its base, and a typi-
cal cross-section at a distance from the origin are shown in Figure 13.
Since 
lies on the circle, we have 
and so the base of the triangle
is 
. Since the triangle is equilateral, we see from Figure 13(c) 
that its height is 
. The cross-sectional area is therefore
and the volume of the solid is

EXAMPLE 8 Find the volume of a pyramid whose base is a square with side
and whose height is .
SOLUTION We place the origin 
at the vertex of the pyramid and the -axis along
its central axis as in Figure 14. Any plane 
that passes through and is perpendi-
cular to the -axis intersects the pyramid in a square with side of length , say. We
can express in terms of by observing from the similar triangles in Figure 15 that
and so 
. [Another method is to observe that the line 
has slope
and so its equation is 
.] Thus the cross-sectional area is
The pyramid lies between 
and 
, so its volume is
■
NOTE We didn’t need to place the vertex of the pyramid at the origin in Example 8.
We did so merely to make the equations simple. If, instead, we had placed the center
of the base at the origin and the vertex on the positive -axis, as in Figure 16, you can
verify that we would have obtained the integral

VOLUMES BY CYLINDRICAL SHELLS
Some volume problems are very difﬁcult to handle by the methods of the preceding
section. For instance, let’s consider the problem of ﬁnding the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating about the -axis the region bounded by 
and 
.
(See Figure 1.) If we slice perpendicular to the -axis, we get a washer. But to com-
pute the inner radius and the outer radius of the washer, we would have to solve the
cubic equation 
for in terms of ; that’s not easy.
Fortunately, there is a method, called the method of cylindrical shells, that is eas-
ier to use in such a case. Figure 2 shows a cylindrical shell with inner radius , outer
radius , and height . Its volume 
is calculated by subtracting the volume 
of the
inner cylinder from the volume 
of the outer cylinder:
If we let

(the average
radius of the shell), then this formula for the volume of a cylindrical shell becomes
and it can be remembered as

be the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region bounded

We divide the interval 
into n subintervals 
of equal width 
and let
be the midpoint of the ith subinterval. If the rectangle with base 
and height
is rotated about the y-axis, then the result is a cylindrical shell with average
radius , height 
, and thickness 
(see Figure 4), so by Formula 1 its volume is
Therefore an approximation to the volume 
of is given by the sum of the volumes
of these shells:
This approximation appears to become better as 
. But, from the deﬁnition of an
integral, we know that
Thus the following appears plausible; a proof is outlined in Exercise 43.
The volume of the solid in Figure 3, obtained by rotating about the y-axis
the region under the curve 
from a to b, is
The best way to remember Formula 2 is to think of a typical shell, cut and ﬂattened
as in Figure 5, with radius x, circumference 
, height

This type of reasoning will be helpful in other situations, such as when we rotate
about lines other than the -axis.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the
region bounded by 
and 
.
SOLUTION From the sketch in Figure 6 we see that a typical shell has radius x,
circumference 
, and height 
. So, by the shell method, the 
volume is
It can be veriﬁed that the shell method gives the same answer as slicing.
■
NOTE Comparing the solution of Example 1 with the remarks at the beginning of
this section, we see that the method of cylindrical shells is much easier than the 
washer method for this problem. We did not have to ﬁnd the coordinates of the local
maximum and we did not have to solve the equation of the curve for in terms of .
However, in other examples the methods of the preceding section may be easier.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis
the region between 
and 
.
SOLUTION The region and a typical shell are shown in Figure 8. We see that the
shell has radius x, circumference 
, and height 
. So the volume is
■
As the following example shows, the shell method works just as well if we rotate
about the x-axis. We simply have to draw a diagram to identify the radius and height
of a shell.

EXAMPLE 3 Use cylindrical shells to ﬁnd the volume of the solid obtained by
rotating about the -axis the region under the curve 
from 0 to 1.
SOLUTION This problem was solved using disks in Example 2 in Section 7.2. To
use shells we relabel the curve 
(in the ﬁgure in that example) as 
in
Figure 9. For rotation about the x-axis we see that a typical shell has radius y, cir-
cumference 
, and height 
. So the volume is
In this problem the disk method was simpler.

ARC LENGTH
What do we mean by the length of a curve? We might think of ﬁtting a piece of string
to the curve in Figure 1 and then measuring the string against a ruler. But that might
be difﬁcult to do with much accuracy if we have a complicated curve. We need a pre-
cise deﬁnition for the length of an arc of a curve, in the same spirit as the deﬁnitions
we developed for the concepts of area and volume.
If the curve is a polygon, we can easily ﬁnd its length; we just add the lengths of
the line segments that form the polygon. (We can use the distance formula to ﬁnd the
distance between the endpoints of each segment.) We are going to deﬁne the length of
a general curve by ﬁrst approximating it by a polygon and then taking a limit as the
number of segments of the polygon is increased. This process is familiar for the case
of a circle, where the circumference is the limit of lengths of inscribed polygons (see
Figure 2).
Now suppose that a curve 
is deﬁned by the equation 
, where f is con-
tinuous and 
. We obtain a polygonal approximation to 
by dividing the
interval 
into n subintervals with endpoints 
and equal width 
. If
, then the point 
lies on 
and the polygon with vertices 
, 
, . . . ,
, illustrated in Figure 3, is an approximation to . The length L of 
is approxi-
mately the length of this polygon and the approximation gets better as we let n
increase. (See Figure 4, where the arc of the curve between 
and 
has been 
magniﬁed and approximations with successively smaller values of 
are shown.)
Therefore we deﬁne the length
of the curve 
with equation 
, 
,
as the limit of the lengths of these inscribed polygons (if the limit exists):

Notice that the procedure for deﬁning arc length is very similar to the procedure
we used for deﬁning area and volume: We divided the curve into a large number of
small parts. We then found the approximate lengths of the small parts and added them.
Finally, we took the limit as 
. (For the limit of a sequence, see the margin note
on page 202 or Section 8.1.)
The deﬁnition of arc length given by Equation 1 is not very convenient for compu-
tational purposes, but we can derive an integral formula for 
in the case where 
has
a continuous derivative. [Such a function 
is called smooth because a small change
in produces a small change in

If we let

By applying the Mean Value Theorem to

If we use Leibniz notation for derivatives, we can write the arc length formula as 
follows:
EXAMPLE 1 Find the length of the arc of the semicubical parabola 
between

interchanging the roles of

ing formula for its length:

to evaluate explicitly. Thus we sometimes have to be content with ﬁnding an approx-
imation to the length of a curve as in the following example.

THE ARC LENGTH FUNCTION
We will ﬁnd it useful to have a function that measures the arc length of a curve from
a particular starting point to any other point on the curve. Thus if a smooth curve
has the equation 
, 
, let 
be the distance along 
from the initial
point 
to the point 
. Then 
is a function, called the arc length
function, and, by Formula 2,
(We have replaced the variable of integration by so that 
does not have two mean-
ings.) We can use Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to differentiate Equa-
tion 5 (since the integrand is continuous):
Equation 6 shows that the rate of change of with respect to is always at least 1 and
is equal to 1 when 
, the slope of the curve, is 0. The differential of arc length is
and this equation is sometimes written in the symmetric form
The geometric interpretation of Equation 8 is shown in Figure 7. It can be used as a
mnemonic device for remembering both of the Formulas 3 and 4. If we write 
,
then from Equation 8 either we can solve to get 
, which gives 
, or we can solve
to get
which gives 
.

7.5
AREA OF A SURFACE OF REVOLUTION
A surface of revolution is formed when a curve is rotated about a line. Such a surface
is the lateral boundary of a solid of revolution of the type discussed in Sections 7.2
and 7.3.
We want to deﬁne the area of a surface of revolution in such a way that it corre-
sponds to our intuition. If the surface area is , we can imagine that painting the sur-
face would require the same amount of paint as does a ﬂat region with area .
Let’s start with some simple surfaces. The lateral surface area of a circular cylin-
der with radius and height 
is taken to be 
because we can imagine cut-
ting the cylinder and unrolling it (as in Figure 1) to obtain a rectangle with dimensions
and .
Likewise, we can take a circular cone with base radius and slant height , cut it
along the dashed line in Figure 2, and ﬂatten it to form a sector of a circle with radius
and central angle 
. We know that, in general, the area of a sector of a 
circle with radius and angle 
is
(see Exercise 69 in Section 6.2) and so in this
case the area is
Therefore we deﬁne the lateral surface area of a cone to be 
.
What about more complicated surfaces of revolution? If we follow the strategy 
we used with arc length, we can approximate the original curve by a polygon. When
this polygon is rotated about an axis, it creates a simpler surface whose surface area
approximates the actual surface area. By taking a limit, we can determine the exact
surface area.
The approximating surface, then, consists of a number of bands, each formed by
rotating a line segment about an axis. To ﬁnd the surface area, each of these bands can
be considered a portion of a circular cone, as shown in Figure 3. The area of the band
(or frustum of a cone) with slant height and upper and lower radii 
and 
is found
by subtracting the areas of two cones:
From similar triangles we have

Putting this in Equation 1, we get

is the average radius of the band.
Now we apply this formula to our strategy. Consider the surface shown in Fig-
ure 4, which is obtained by rotating the curve

where

APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING
Among the many applications of integral calculus to physics and engineering, we con-
sider three: work, force due to water pressure, and centers of mass. As with our pre-
vious applications to geometry (areas, volumes, and lengths), our strategy is to break
up the physical quantity into a large number of small parts, approximate each small
part, add the results, take the limit, and evaluate the resulting integral.
WORK
The term work is used in everyday language to mean the total amount of effort
required to perform a task. In physics it has a technical meaning that depends on the
idea of a force. Intuitively, you can think of a force as describing a push or pull on an
object—for example, a horizontal push of a book across a table or the downward pull
of the earth’s gravity on a ball. In general, if an object moves along a straight line with
position function 
, then the force
on the object (in the same direction) is given
by Newton’s Second Law of Motion as the product of its mass 
and its acceleration:
In the SI metric system, the mass is measured in kilograms (kg), the displacement in
meters (m), the time in seconds (s), and the force in newtons (
). Thus a
force of 1 N acting on a mass of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 ms . In the US
Customary system the fundamental unit is chosen to be the unit of force, which is the
pound.
In the case of constant acceleration, the force 
is also constant and the work done
is deﬁned to be the product of the force 
and the distance 
that the object moves:
If 
is measured in newtons and 
in meters, then the unit for 
is a newton-meter,
which is called a joule (J). If 
is measured in pounds and 
in feet, then the unit for
is a foot-pound (ft-lb), which is about 1.36 J.
For instance, suppose you lift a 1.2-kg book off the ﬂoor to put it on a desk that is
0.7 m high. The force you exert is equal and opposite to that exerted by gravity, so
Equation 1 gives

escape the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld.

and then Equation 2 gives the work done as
But if a 20-lb weight is lifted 6 ft off the ground, then the force is given as 
lb,
so the work done is
Here we didn’t multiply by because we were given the weight (a force) and not the
mass.
Equation 2 deﬁnes work as long as the force is constant, but what happens if the
force is variable? Let’s suppose that the object moves along the -axis in the positive
direction, from 
to 
, and at each point between and a force 
acts
on the object, where 
is a continuous function. We divide the interval 
into n
subintervals with endpoints 
and equal width 
. We choose a sample
point 
in the th subinterval 
. Then the force at that point is 
. If 
is large, then 
is small, and since 
is continuous, the values of 
don’t change 
very much over the interval 
. In other words, is almost constant on the inter-
val and so the work 
that is done in moving the particle from 
to 
is approxi-
mately given by Equation 2:
Thus we can approximate the total work by
It seems that this approximation becomes better as we make 
larger. Therefore we
deﬁne the work done in moving the object from a to b as the limit of this quantity
as 
. Since the right side of 
is a Riemann sum, we recognize its limit as being
a deﬁnite integral and so
EXAMPLE 1 When a particle is located a distance feet from the origin, a force 
of 
pounds acts on it. How much work is done in moving it from 
to 
?
SOLUTION
The work done is 
ft-lb.
■
In the next example we use a law from physics: Hooke’s Law states that the force
required to maintain a spring stretched units beyond its natural length is proportional

where 
is a positive constant (called the spring constant). Hooke’s Law holds pro-
vided that is not too large (see Figure 1).
EXAMPLE 2 A force of 40 N is required to hold a spring that has been stretched
from its natural length of 10 cm to a length of 15 cm. How much work is done in
stretching the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm?
SOLUTION According to Hooke’s Law, the force required to hold the spring
stretched meters beyond its natural length is 
. When the spring is
stretched from 10 cm to 15 cm, the amount stretched is 
cm
m. This means
that 
so
Thus

EXAMPLE 3 A 200-lb cable is 100 ft long and hangs vertically from the top of a
tall building. How much work is required to lift the cable to the top of the building?
SOLUTION Here we don’t have a formula for the force function, but we can use an
argument similar to the one that led to Deﬁnition 4.
Let’s place the origin at the top of the building and the -axis pointing downward
as in Figure 2. We divide the cable into small parts with length 
. If 
is a point
in the 
such interval, then all points in the interval are lifted by approximately the
same amount, namely 
. The cable weighs 2 pounds per foot, so the weight of the
part is 
. Thus the work done on the 
part, in foot-pounds, is 
We get the total work done by adding all these approximations and letting the
number of parts become large (so 
):

EXAMPLE 4 A tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with height 10 m and
base radius 4 m. It is ﬁlled with water to a height of 8 m. Find the work required to
empty the tank by pumping all of the water to the top of the tank. (The density of
water is 1000 kgm .)
SOLUTION Let’s measure depths from the top of the tank by introducing a vertical
coordinate line as in Figure 3. The water extends from a depth of 2 m to a depth 
of 10 m and so we divide the interval 
into n subintervals with endpoints
and choose 
in the th subinterval. This divides the water into
layers. The th layer is approximated by a circular cylinder with radius 
and

from similar triangles, using Figure 4, as follows:
Thus an approximation to the volume of the th layer of water is

The force required to raise this layer must overcome the force of gravity and so
Each particle in the layer must travel a distance of approximately
. The work
done to raise this layer to the top is approximately the product of the force
and the

HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE AND FORCE
Deep-sea divers realize that water pressure increases as they dive deeper. This is
because the weight of the water above them increases.
In general, suppose that a thin horizontal plate with area 
square meters is sub-
merged in a ﬂuid of density kilograms per cubic meter at a depth meters below the
surface of the ﬂuid as in Figure 5. The ﬂuid directly above the plate has volume
, so its mass is 
. The force exerted by the ﬂuid on the plate is

The SI unit for measuring pressure is newtons per square meter, which is called a 
pascal (abbreviation: 1 Nm
Pa). Since this is a small unit, the kilopascal (kPa)
is often used. For instance, because the density of water is 
kgm , the pres-
sure at the bottom of a swimming pool 2 m deep is
An important principle of ﬂuid pressure is the experimentally veriﬁed fact that at
any point in a liquid the pressure is the same in all directions. (A diver feels the same
pressure on nose and both ears.) Thus the pressure in any direction at a depth 
in a
ﬂuid with mass density 
is given by
This helps us determine the hydrostatic force against a vertical plate or wall or dam
in a ﬂuid. This is not a straightforward problem because the pressure is not constant
but increases as the depth increases.
EXAMPLE 5 A dam has the shape of the trapezoid shown in Figure 6. The
height is 20 m and the width is 50 m at the top and 30 m at the bottom. Find the
force on the dam due to hydrostatic pressure if the water level is 4 m from the top of
the dam.
SOLUTION We choose a vertical -axis with origin at the surface of the water as in
Figure 7(a). The depth of the water is 16 m, so we divide the interval 
into 
sub intervals with endpoints 
and we choose 
. The 
horizontal strip
of the dam is approximated by a rectangle with height 
and width 
, where, from
similar triangles in Figure 7(b),
or    
and so
If 
is the area of the 
strip, then
If 
is small, then the pressure 
on the 
strip is almost constant and we can use
Equation 5 to write
The hydrostatic force 
acting on the 
strip is the product of the pressure and the
area:
Adding these forces and taking the limit as 
, we obtain the total hydrostatic

EXAMPLE 6 Find the hydrostatic force on one end of a cylindrical drum with radius
3 ft if the drum is submerged in water 10 ft deep.
SOLUTION In this example it is convenient to choose the axes as in Figure 8 so
that the origin is placed at the center of the drum. Then the circle has a simple equa-
tion, 
. As in Example 5 we divide the circular region into horizontal
strips of equal width. From the equation of the circle, we see that the length of the
strip is
and so its area is
The pressure on this strip is approximately
and so the force on the strip is approximately
The total force is obtained by adding the forces on all the strips and taking the limit:
The second integral is 0 because the integrand is an odd function (see Theorem
4.5.6). The ﬁrst integral can be evaluated using the trigonometric substitution
, but it’s simpler to observe that it is the area of a semicircular disk with
radius 3. Thus

MOMENTS AND CENTERS OF MASS
Our main objective here is to ﬁnd the point 
on which a thin plate of any given shape
balances horizontally as in Figure 9. This point is called the center of mass (or cen-
ter of gravity) of the plate.
We ﬁrst consider the simpler situation illustrated in Figure 10, where two masses
and 
are attached to a rod of negligible mass on opposite sides of a fulcrum and
at distances 
and 
from the fulcrum. The rod will balance if
This is an experimental fact discovered by Archimedes and called the Law of the Lever.
(Think of a lighter person balancing a heavier one on a seesaw by sitting farther away
from the center.)
Now suppose that the rod lies along the -axis with 
at 
and 
at 
and the
center of mass at . If we compare Figures 10 and 11, we see that 
and
and so Equation 6 gives
The numbers 
and 
are called the moments of the masses 
and 
(with
respect to the origin), and Equation 7 says that the center of mass 
is obtained by
adding the moments of the masses and dividing by the total mass 
.
In general, if we have a system of 
particles with masses 
, 
. . . , 
located
at the points 
, 
. . . , 
on the -axis, it can be shown similarly that the center of
mass of the system is located at
where 
is the total mass of the system, and the sum of the individual
moments
is called the moment of the system about the origin. Then Equation 8 could be re-
written as 
, which says that if the total mass were considered as being con-
centrated at the center of mass , then its moment would be the same as the moment
of the system.

Now we consider a system of particles with masses 
, 
. . . , 
located at the
points 
, 
, . . . , 
in the 
-plane as shown in Figure 12. By anal-
ogy with the one-dimensional case, we deﬁne the moment of the system about the
y-axis to be
and the moment of the system about the x-axis as
Then 
measures the tendency of the system to rotate about the -axis and 
mea-
sures the tendency to rotate about the -axis.
As in the one-dimensional case, the coordinates 
of the center of mass are
given in terms of the moments by the formulas
where 
is the total mass. Since 
and 
, the center of mass 
is the point where a single particle of mass 
would have the same moments as
the system.
EXAMPLE 7 Find the moments and center of mass of the system of objects that
have masses 3, 4, and 8 at the points 
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION We use Equations 9 and 10 to compute the moments:
Since 
, we use Equations 11 to obtain
Thus the center of mass is 
. (See Figure 13.)
■
Next we consider a ﬂat plate (called a lamina) with uniform density 
that occu-
pies a region 
of the plane. We wish to locate the center of mass of the plate, which
is called the centroid of 
. In doing so we use the following physical principles: The
symmetry principle says that if 
is symmetric about a line , then the centroid of 
lies on . (If 
is reﬂected about , then 
remains the same so its centroid remains
ﬁxed. But the only ﬁxed points lie on .) Thus the centroid of a rectangle is its center.
Moments should be deﬁned so that if the entire mass of a region is concentrated at the
center of mass, then its moments remain unchanged. Also, the moment of the union
of two nonoverlapping regions should be the sum of the moments of the individual
regions.

Suppose that the region 
is of the type shown in Figure 14(a); that is, 
lies
between the lines 
and 
, above the -axis, and beneath the graph of ,
where is a continuous function. We divide the interval 
into n subintervals with
endpoints 
and equal width 
. We choose the sample point 
to be the
midpoint 
of the 
subinterval, that is, 
. This determines the
polygonal approximation to 
shown in Figure 14(b). The centroid of the 
approx-
imating rectangle 
is its center 
. Its area is 
, so its mass is
The moment of 
about the -axis is the product of its mass and the distance from
to the -axis, which is 
Adding these moments, we obtain the moment of the polygonal approximation to 
, and then by taking the limit as 
we obtain the moment of 
itself about the 
-axis:
In a similar fashion we compute the moment of 
about the -axis as the product
of its mass and the distance from 
to the -axis:
Again we add these moments and take the limit to obtain the moment of 
about the 
-axis:
Just as for systems of particles, the center of mass of the plate is deﬁned so that
and 
. But the mass of the plate is the product of its density and its
area:
and so
Notice the cancellation of the ’s. The location of the center of mass is independent
of the density.

The centroid is

We end this section by showing a surprising connection between centroids and vol-
umes of revolution.
THEOREM OF PAPPUS Let 
be a plane region that lies entirely on one side
of a line in the plane. If 
is rotated about , then the volume of the resulting
solid is the product of the area 
of 
and the distance 
traveled by the cen-
troid of 
.
PROOF We give the proof for the special case in which the region lies between
and 
as in Figure 16 and the line is the -axis. Using the method
of cylindrical shells (see Section 7.3), we have
(by Formulas 13)
where 
is the distance traveled by the centroid during one rotation about the 
-axis.
EXAMPLE 10 A torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius about a line in
the plane of the circle that is a distance 
from the center of the circle. Find
the volume of the torus.
SOLUTION The circle has area 
. By the symmetry principle, its centroid is
its center and so the distance traveled by the centroid during a rotation is 
.
Therefore, by the Theorem of Pappus, the volume of the torus is
■
The method of Example 10 should be compared with the method of Exercise 47 in
Section 7.2.

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
A differential equation is an equation that contains an unknown function and one or
more of its derivatives. Here are some examples:
In each of these differential equations is an unknown function of . The importance 
of differential equations lies in the fact that when a scientist or engineer formulates 
a physical law in mathematical terms, it frequently turns out to be a differential 
equation.
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that occurs
in the equation. Thus Equations 1, 2, and 3 are of order 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
A function
is called a solution of a differential equation if the equation is satis-
ﬁed when 
and its derivatives are substituted into the equation. Thus is a solu-
tion of Equation 1 if
for all values of x in some interval.
When we are asked to solve a differential equation we are expected to ﬁnd all 
possible solutions of the equation. We have already solved some particularly simple
differential equations, namely, those of the form 
. For instance, we know that
the general solution of the differential equation 
is given by 
,
where C is an arbitrary constant.
But, in general, solving a differential equation is not an easy matter. There is no
systematic technique that enables us to solve all differential equations. In this section
we learn how to solve a certain type of differential equation called a separable equa-
tion. At the end of the section, however, we will see how to sketch a rough graph of a
solution of a ﬁrst-order differential equation, even when it is impossible to ﬁnd a for-
mula for the solution.
SEPARABLE EQUATIONS
A separable equation is a ﬁrst-order differential equation that can be written in the
form
The name separable comes from the fact that the expression on the right side can be
“separated” into a function of 
and a function of . Equivalently, if 
, we
could write

where 
. To solve this equation we rewrite it in the differential form
so that all ’s are on one side of the equation and all ’s are on the other side. Then we
integrate both sides of the equation:
Equation 5 deﬁnes 
implicitly as a function of . In some cases we may be able to
solve for in terms of .
We use the Chain Rule to justify this procedure: If 
and satisfy 
, then
so
and
Thus Equation 4 is satisﬁed.
When applying differential equations, we are usually not as interested in ﬁnding a
family of solutions (the general solution) as we are in ﬁnding a solution that satisﬁes
some additional requirement. In many physical problems we need to ﬁnd the particu-
lar solution that satisﬁes a condition of the form 
. This is called an initial
condition, and the problem of ﬁnding a solution of the differential equation that sat-
isﬁes the initial condition is called an initial-value problem.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) Solve the differential equation 
.
(b) Find the solution of this equation that satisﬁes the initial condition 
.
SOLUTION
(a) We write the equation in terms of differentials and integrate both sides:
where 
is an arbitrary constant. (We could have used a constant 
on the left side
and another constant 
on the right side. But then we could combine these con-
stants by writing 
.)
Solving for , we get
We could leave the solution like this or we could write it in the form
where 
. (Since 
is an arbitrary constant, so is .)

■The technique for solving separable 
differential equations was ﬁrst used by
James Bernoulli (in 1690) in solving 
a problem about pendulums and by
Leibniz (in a letter to Huygens in 
1691). John Bernoulli explained the
general method in a paper published 
in 1694.

Thus the solution of the initial-value problem is

EXAMPLE 2 Solve the differential equation

SOLUTION Writing the equation in differential form and integrating both sides, we
have
where 
is a constant. Equation 6 gives the general solution implicitly. In this case
it’s impossible to solve the equation to express explicitly as a function of .
■
EXAMPLE 3 Solve the equation 
.
SOLUTION First we rewrite the equation using Leibniz notation: 
If 
, we can rewrite it in differential notation and integrate:
This equation deﬁnes implicitly as a function of . But in this case we can solve
explicitly for as follows:
so
We can easily verify that the function 
is also a solution of the given differen-
tial equation. So we can write the general solution in the form
where 
is an arbitrary constant (

SOLUTION This differential equation was studied in Section 5.5, where it was
called the law of natural growth (or decay). Since it is a separable equation, we can
solve it by the methods of this section as follows:
where 
is an arbitrary constant.

LOGISTIC GROWTH
The differential equation of Example 4 is appropriate for modeling population growth
says that the rate of growth is proportional to the size of the population)
under conditions of unlimited environment and food supply. However, in a restricted
environment and with limited food supply, the population cannot exceed a maximal
size 
(called the carrying capacity) at which it consumes its entire food supply. If
we make the assumption that the rate of growth of population is jointly proportional
to the size of the population 
and the amount by which falls short of the maximal
size 
, then we have the equation
where is a constant. Equation 7 is called the logistic differential equation and was
used by the Dutch mathematical biologist Pierre-François Verhulst in the 1840s to model
world population growth.
The logistic equation is separable, so we write it in the form
Using partial fractions, we have

MIXING PROBLEMS
A typical mixing problem involves a tank of ﬁxed capacity ﬁlled with a thoroughly
mixed solution of some substance, such as salt. A solution of a given concentration
enters the tank at a ﬁxed rate and the mixture, thoroughly stirred, leaves at a ﬁxed rate,
which may differ from the entering rate. If 
denotes the amount of substance in the
tank at time , then 
is the rate at which the substance is being added minus the
rate at which it is being removed. The mathematical description of this situation often
leads to a ﬁrst-order sepa rable differential equation. We can use the same type of rea-
soning to model a variety of phenomena: chemical reactions, discharge of pollutants
into a lake, injection of a drug into the bloodstream.
EXAMPLE 5 A tank contains 20 kg of salt dissolved in 5000 L of water. Brine that
contains 0.03 kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of 25 Lmin. The
solution is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate. How
much salt remains in the tank after half an hour?
SOLUTION Let 
be the amount of salt (in kilograms) after minutes. We are
given that 
and we want to ﬁnd 
. We do this by ﬁnding a differential
equation satisﬁed by 
. Note that 
is the rate of change of the amount of salt,

where (rate in) is the rate at which salt enters the tank and (rate out) is the rate at
which salt leaves the tank. We have
The tank always contains 5000 L of liquid, so the concentration at time is
(measured in kilograms per liter). Since the brine ﬂows out at a rate of
25 Lmin, we have
Thus from Equation 9 we get
Solving this separable differential equation, we obtain
Since

Therefore
Since

solution curves by means of a direction ﬁeld. If a solution curve passes through a point
, then its slope at that point is , which is equal to 
. If we draw short line
segments with slopes 
at several points 
, the result is called a direction ﬁeld
(or slope ﬁeld). These line segments indicate the direction in which a solution curve
is heading, so the direction ﬁeld helps us visualize the general shape of these curves.
EXAMPLE 6
(a) Sketch the direction ﬁeld for the differential equation 
.
(b) Use part (a) to sketch the solution curve that passes through the origin.
SOLUTION
(a) We start by computing the slope at several points in the following chart:
Now we draw short line segments with these slopes at these points. The result is the
direction ﬁeld shown in Figure 6.
(b) We start at the origin and move to the right in the direction of the line segment
(which has slope 
). We continue to draw the solution curve so that it moves paral-
lel to the nearby line segments. The resulting solution curve is shown in Figure 7.
Returning to the origin, we draw the solution curve to the left as well.
■
The more line segments we draw in a direction ﬁeld, the clearer the picture
becomes. Of course, it’s tedious to compute slopes and draw line segments for a huge
number of points by hand, but computers are well suited for this task. Figure 8 shows
a more detailed, computer-drawn direction ﬁeld for the differential equation in
Example 6. It enables us to draw, with reasonable accuracy, the solution curves shown
in Figure 9 with -intercepts

SEQUENCES
A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a deﬁnite order:
The number 
is called the ﬁrst term,
is the second term, and in general 
is the
nth term. We will deal exclusively with inﬁnite sequences and so each term 
will
have a successor 
.
Notice that for every positive integer 
there is a corresponding number 
and so
a sequence can be deﬁned as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers.
But we usually write 
instead of the function notation 
for the value of the func-
tion at the number .
NOTATION The sequence {
, 
, 
, . . .} is also denoted by
EXAMPLE 1 Some sequences can be deﬁned by giving a formula for the nth term.
In the following examples we give three descriptions of the sequence: one by using
the preceding notation, another by using the deﬁning formula, and a third by writing
out the terms of the sequence. Notice that 
doesn’t have to start at 1.

SERIES
Infinite series are sums of infinitely many terms. (One of our aims in this chapter is to define exactly
what is meant by an infinite sum.) Their importance in calculus stems from Newton’s idea of represent-
ing functions as sums of infinite series. For instance, in finding areas he often integrated a function by
first expressing it as a series and then integrating each term of the series. We will pursue his idea in
Section 8.7 in order to integrate such functions as 
. (Recall that we have previously been unable to
do this.) Many of the functions that arise in mathematical physics and chemistry, such as Bessel func-
tions, are defined as sums of series, so it is important to be familiar with the basic concepts of conver-
gence of infinite sequences and series.
Physicists also use series in another way, as we will see in Section 8.8. In studying fields as diverse as
optics, special relativity, and electromagnetism, they analyze phenomena by replacing a function with
the first few terms in the series that represents it.

EXAMPLE 2 Find a formula for the general term 
of the sequence
assuming that the pattern of the ﬁrst few terms continues.
SOLUTION We are given that
Notice that the numerators of these fractions start with 3 and increase by 1 whenever
we go to the next term. The second term has numerator 4, the third term has numer-
ator 5; in general, the th term will have numerator 
. The denominators are the
powers of 5, so 
has denominator 
. The signs of the terms are alternately posi-
tive and negative, so we need to multiply by a power of 
. In Example 1(b) the
factor 
meant we started with a negative term. Here we want to start with a
positive term and so we use 
or 
. Therefore

This sequence arose when the 13th-century Italian mathematician known as Fibonacci
solved a problem concerning the breeding of rabbits (see Exercise 45).

A sequence such as the one in Example 1(a), 
, can be pictured
either by plotting its terms on a number line as in Figure 1 or by plotting its graph as
in Figure 2. Note that, since a sequence is a function whose domain is the set of posi-
tive integers, its graph consists of isolated points with coordinates

sufﬁciently large. We indicate this by 
writing
In general, the notation
means that the terms of the sequence 
approach 
as becomes large. Notice that
the following deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence is very similar to the deﬁnition of a
limit of a function at inﬁnity given in Section 1.6.
DEFINITION A sequence 
has the limit
and we write
if we can make the terms 
as close to 
as we like by taking 
sufﬁciently
large. If 
exists, we say the sequence converges (or is convergent).
Otherwise, we say the sequence diverges (or is divergent).
Figure 3 illustrates Deﬁnition 1 by showing the graphs of two sequences that have
the limit .
A more precise version of Deﬁnition 1 is as follows.
DEFINITION A sequence 
has the limit
and we write
if for every 
there is a corresponding integer 
such that
if    
then    
Deﬁnition 2 is illustrated by Figure 4, in which the terms 
, 
, 
, . . . are plotted
on a number line. No matter how small an interval 
is chosen, there exists
an 
such that all terms of the sequence from 
onward must lie in that interval.

■CREATING GRAPHS OF SEQUENCES
Some computer algebra systems have spe-
cial commands that enable us to create
sequences and graph them directly. With
most graphing calcula tors, however,
sequences can be graphed by using para-
metric equations. For instance, the
sequence in Example 9 can be graphed 
by entering the parametric equations
and graphing in dot mode starting with 
, setting the -step equal to . The 
result is shown in Figure 10.

It is called decreasing if

DEFINITION A sequence 
is bounded above if there is a number 
such that
It is bounded below if there is a number 
such that
If it is bounded above and below, then 
is a bounded sequence.
For instance, the sequence 
is bounded below 
but not above. The
sequence 
is bounded because 
for all .
We know that not every bounded sequence is convergent [for instance, the 
sequence 
satisﬁes 
but is divergent from Example 6] and 
not every mono tonic sequence is convergent 
. But if a sequence is 
both bounded and monotonic, then it must be convergent. This fact is proved as 
The o rem 11, but intuitively you can understand why it is true by looking at Fig-
ure 12. If 
is increasing and 
for all , then the terms are forced to crowd
together and approach some number .
The proof of Theorem 11 is based on the Completeness Axiom for the set 
of
real numbers, which says that if is a nonempty set of real numbers that has an upper
bound 
(
for all in ), then 
has a least upper bound . (This means that
is an upper bound for , but if 
is any other upper bound, then 
.) The 
Completeness Axiom is an expression of the fact that there is no gap or hole in the real
number line.
MONOTONIC SEQUENCE THEOREM Every bounded, monotonic sequence
is convergent.
PROOF Suppose 
is an increasing sequence. Since 
is bounded, the set
has an upper bound. By the Completeness Axiom it has a least
upper bound . Given 
, 
is not an upper bound for 
(since 
is the least
upper bound). Therefore
But the sequence is increasing so 
for every 
. Thus if 
we have

so 
.
A similar proof (using the greatest lower bound) works if 
is decreasing.
The proof of Theorem 11 shows that a sequence that is increasing and bounded
above is convergent. (Likewise, a decreasing sequence that is bounded below is con-
vergent.) This fact is used many times in dealing with inﬁnite series in Sections 8.2
and 8.3.
Another use of Theorem 11 is indicated in Exercises 42–44.

What do we mean when we express a number as an inﬁnite decimal? For instance,
what does it mean to write
The convention behind our decimal notation is that any number can be written as an
inﬁnite sum. Here it means that
where the three dots 
indicate that the sum continues forever, and the more terms
we add, the closer we get to the actual value of .
In general, if we try to add the terms of an inﬁnite sequence 
we get an
expression of the form
which is called an inﬁnite series (or just a series) and is denoted, for short, by the
symbol
Does it make sense to talk about the sum of inﬁnitely many terms?
It would be impossible to ﬁnd a ﬁnite sum for the series
because if we start adding the terms we get the cumulative sums 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 
21, . . . and, after the 
term, we get 
, which becomes very large as 
increases.
However, if we start to add the terms of the series
we get , , , , , , . . . , 
, . . . . The table shows that as we add more and
more terms, these partial sums become closer and closer to 1. In fact, by adding suf-
ﬁciently many terms of the series we can make the partial sums as close as we like 
to 1. So it seems reasonable to say that the sum of this inﬁnite series is 1 and to write
We use a similar idea to determine whether or not a general series 
has a sum.
We consider the partial sums

and, in general,
These partial sums form a new sequence 
, which may or may not have a limit. If
exists (as a ﬁnite number), then, as in the preceding example, we call it
the sum of the inﬁnite series 
.
DEFINITION Given a series 
, let 
denote
its th partial sum:
If the sequence 
is convergent and 
exists as a real number,
then the series 
is called convergent and we write
The number is called the sum of the series. If the sequence 
is divergent,
then the series is called divergent.
Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. So when we
write 
we mean that by adding sufﬁciently many terms of the series we can
get as close as we like to the number . Notice that
EXAMPLE 1 An important example of an inﬁnite series is the geometric series
Each term is obtained from the preceding one by multiplying it by the common
ratio . (We have already considered the special case where 
and 
on
page 442.)
If 
, then 
. Since 
doesn’t
exist, the geometric series diverges in this case.
If

■What do we really mean when we 
say that the sum of the series in Exam-
ple 2 is ? Of course, we can’t literally
add an inﬁnite number of terms, one by
one. But, according to Deﬁnition 2, the
total sum is the limit of the sequence 
of partial sums. So, by taking the sum
of sufﬁciently many terms, we can get
as close as we like to the number . 
The table shows the ﬁrst ten partial
sums 
and the graph in Figure 2 shows
how the sequence of partial sums
approaches .3

the sequence

sequence 
is 0.

NOTE 2 The converse of Theorem 6 is not true in general. If

cannot conclude that

we have 
as 
, but we showed in Example 7 that

TEST FOR DIVERGENCE If

The Test for Divergence follows from Theorem 6 because, if the series is not diver-
gent, then it is convergent, and so 
.

SOLUTION
So the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.

THE INTEGRAL AND COMPARISON TESTS
In general, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the exact sum of a series. We were able to accomplish
this for geometric series and the series 
because in each of those cases
we could ﬁnd a simple formula for the 
partial sum . But usually it isn’t easy 
to compute 
. Therefore, in this section and the next, we develop tests that
enable us to determine whether a series is convergent or divergent without explicitly
ﬁnding its sum.
In this section we deal only with series with positive terms, so the partial sums are
in creasing. In view of the Monotonic Sequence Theorem, to decide whether a series
is convergent or divergent, we need to determine whether the partial sums are bounded
or not.
TESTING WITH AN INTEGRAL
Let’s investigate the series whose terms are the reciprocals of the squares of the posi-
tive integers:
There’s no simple formula for the sum 
of the ﬁrst 
terms, but the computer-
generated table of values given in the margin suggests that the partial sums are ap-
proaching a number near 1.64 as 
and so it looks as if the series is convergent.
We can conﬁrm this impression with a geometric argument. Figure 1 shows the
curve 
and rectangles that lie below the curve. The base of each rectangle is
an interval of length 1; the height is equal to the value of the function 
at the
right endpoint of the interval. So the sum of the areas of the rectangles is
If we exclude the ﬁrst rectangle, the total area of the remaining rectangles is 
smaller than the area under the curve 
for 
, which is the value of the
integral 
. In Section 6.6 we discovered that this improper integral is con-
vergent and has value 1. So the picture shows that all the partial sums are less than
Thus the partial sums are bounded and the series converges. The sum of the series (the

limit of the partial sums) is also less than 2:
[The exact sum of this series was found by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler
(1707–1783) to be 
, but the proof of this fact is beyond the scope of this book.]
Now let’s look at the series
The table of values of 
suggests that the partial sums aren’t approaching a ﬁnite num-
ber, so we suspect that the given series may be divergent. Again we use a picture for
conﬁrmation. Figure 2 shows the curve 
, but this time we use rectangles
whose tops lie above the curve.
The base of each rectangle is an interval of length 1. The height is equal to the
value of the function 
at the left endpoint of the interval. So the sum of the
areas of all the rectangles is
This total area is greater than the area under the curve 
for 
, which is
equal to the integral 
. But we know from Section 6.6 that this improper
integral is divergent. In other words, the area under the curve is inﬁnite. So the sum of
the series must be inﬁnite, that is, the series is divergent.
The same sort of geometric reasoning that we used for these two series can be used
to prove the following test. (The proof is given at the end of this section.)
THE INTEGRAL TEST Suppose 
is a continuous, positive, decreasing function
on 
and let 
. Then the series 
is convergent if and only if
the improper integral 
is convergent. In other words:
(i) If 
is convergent, then 
is convergent.
(ii) If 
is divergent, then 
is divergent.

EXAMPLE 1 Determine whether the series 
converges or diverges.
SOLUTION The function

whether or not

Thus

and so we can apply the Integral Test:
Since this improper integral is divergent, the series 
is also divergent by
the Integral Test.

EXAMPLE 2 For what values of

convergent?
SOLUTION If

In either case

Divergence [see (8.2.7)].
If 
, then the function 
is clearly continuous, positive, and
decreasing on 
. We found in Chapter 6 [see (6.6.2)] that
It follows from the Integral Test that the series 
converges if 
and
diverges if 
. (For 
, this series is the harmonic series discussed in
Example 7 in Section 8.2.)

The series in Example 2 is called the p-series. It is important in the rest of this
chapter, so we summarize the results of Example 2 for future reference as follows.

For instance, the series
is convergent because it is a p-series with 
. But the series
is divergent because it is a p-series with 
.
TESTING BY COMPARING
The series
reminds us of the series 
, which is a geometric series with 
and
and is therefore convergent. Because the series 
is so similar to a convergent series,
we have the feeling that it too must be convergent. Indeed, it is. The inequality
shows that our given series 
has smaller terms than those of the geometric series
and therefore all its partial sums are also smaller than 1 (the sum of the geometric
series). This means that its partial sums form a bounded increasing sequence, which is
convergent. It also follows that the sum of the series is less than the sum of the geo-
metric series:
Similar reasoning can be used to prove the following test, which applies only to
series whose terms are positive. The ﬁrst part says that if we have a series whose terms
are smaller than those of a known convergent series, then our series is also convergent.
The second part says that if we start with a series whose terms are larger than those
of a known divergent series, then it too is divergent.
THE COMPARISON TEST Suppose that 
and 
are series with positive
terms.
(i) If 
is convergent and 
for all , then 
is also convergent.
(ii) If 
is divergent and 
for all , then 
is also divergent.
PROOF
(i) Let
Since both series have positive terms, the sequences 
and 
are increasing

■It is important to keep in mind the
distinction between a sequence and a
series. A sequence is a list of numbers,
whereas a series is a sum. With every
series 
there are associated two
sequences: the sequence 
of terms
and the sequence 
of partial sums.

we have

for all . This means that 
is increasing and bounded above
and therefore converges by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem. Thus 
converges.
(ii) If

is increasing). But 
so
. Thus 
. Therefore 
diverges.
In using the Comparison Test we must, of course, have some known series 
for
the purpose of comparison. Most of the time we use one of these series: 
■A 
-series [
con verges if 
and diverges if 
; see 
]
■A geometric series [
converges if 
and diverges if 
; 
see (8.2.4)]
EXAMPLE 3 Determine whether the series 
converges or
diverges.
SOLUTION For large 
the dominant term in the denominator is 
, so we com-
pare the given series with the series 
. Observe that
because the left side has a bigger denominator. (In the notation of the Comparison
Test, 
is the left side and 
is the right side.) We know that
is convergent ( -series with 
). Therefore
is convergent by part (i) of the Comparison Test.
■
Although the condition 
or 
in the Comparison Test is given for all
, we need verify only that it holds for 
, where 
is some ﬁxed integer, because
the convergence of a series is not affected by a ﬁnite number of terms. This is illus-
trated in the next example.
EXAMPLE 4 Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION We used the Integral Test to test this series in Example 1, but we can
also test it by comparing it with the harmonic series. Observe that 
for
and so
We know that 
is divergent ( -series with 
). Thus the given series is
divergent by the Comparison Test.

NOTE The terms of the series being tested must be smaller than those of a conver-
gent series or larger than those of a divergent series. If the terms are larger than the
terms of a convergent series or smaller than those of a divergent series, then the Com-
parison Test doesn’t apply. Consider, for instance, the series
The inequality
is useless as far as the Comparison Test is concerned because 
is conver-
gent and 
. Nonetheless, we have the feeling that 
ought to be con-
vergent because it is very similar to the convergent geometric series 
. In such
cases the following test can be used.
THE LIMIT COMPARISON TEST Suppose that 
and 
are series with 
positive terms. If
where is a ﬁnite number and 
, then either both series converge or 
both diverge.
PROOF Let m and M be positive numbers such that 
. Because 
is

and so
If 
converges, so does 
. Thus 
converges by part (i) of the Com par i -
son Test. If 
diverges, so does 
and part (ii) of the Comparison Test shows
that 
diverges.
EXAMPLE 5 Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION We use the Limit Comparison Test with
and obtain
Since this limit exists and 
is a convergent geometric series, the given series
converges by the Limit Comparison Test.

PROOF OF THE INTEGRAL TEST
We have already seen the basic idea behind the proof of the Integral Test in Figures 1
and 2 for the series 
and 
. For the general series 
look at Figures 3
and 4. The area of the ﬁrst shaded rectangle in Figure 3 is the value of at the right end-
point of 
, that is, 
. So, comparing the areas of the shaded rectangles
with the area under 
from 1 to , we see that
(Notice that this inequality depends on the fact that 
is decreasing.) Likewise, Fig-
ure 4 shows that
(i) If 
is convergent, then 
gives
since 
. Therefore
where 
is a constant. Since 
for all , the sequence 
is bounded above.
Also
since 
. Thus 
is an increasing bounded sequence and so it is 
convergent by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem (8.1.11). This means that 
is 
convergent.
(ii) If 
is divergent, then 
as 
because 
.
But 
gives
and so 
. This implies that 
and so 
diverges.

OTHER CONVERGENCE TESTS
The convergence tests that we have looked at so far apply only to series with positive
terms. In this section we learn how to deal with series whose terms are not necessarily
positive.
ALTERNATING SERIES
An alternating series is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative.
Here are two examples:
We see from these examples that the 
term of an alternating series is of the form
where 
is a positive number. (In fact, 
.)

The following test says that if the terms of an alternating series decrease to 0 in
absolute value, then the series converges.
THE ALTERNATING SERIES TEST If the alternating series
satisﬁes
(i)
(ii)
then the series is convergent.
Before giving the proof let’s look at Figure 1, which gives a picture of the idea
behind the proof. We ﬁrst plot 
on a number line. To ﬁnd 
we subtract 
, so
is to the left of 
. Then to ﬁnd 
we add 
, so 
is to the right of 
. But, since
, 
is to the left of . Continuing in this manner, we see that the partial sums
oscillate back and forth. Since 
, the successive steps are becoming smaller and
smaller. The even partial sums , , , . . . are increasing and the odd partial sums ,
, 
, . . . are decreasing. Thus it seems plausible that both are converging to some
number , which is the sum of the series. Therefore, in the following proof, we con-
sider the even and odd partial sums separately.
PROOF OF THE ALTERNATING SERIES TEST We ﬁrst consider the even partial
sums:
In general
Thus
But we can also write
Every term in brackets is positive, so 
for all . Therefore the sequence
of even partial sums is increasing and bounded above. So it is convergent by the
Monotonic Sequence Theorem. Let’s call its limit , that is,

Now we compute the limit of the odd partial sums:
[by condition (ii)]
Since both the even and odd partial sums converge to , we have 
(see
Exercise 52 in Section 8.1) and so the series is convergent.
EXAMPLE 1 The alternating harmonic series
satisﬁes
(i) 
because    
(ii) 
so the series is convergent by the Alternating Series Test.
■
EXAMPLE 2 The series 
is alternating, but
so condition (ii) is not satisﬁed. Instead, we look at the limit of the
term of the
series:
This limit does not exist, so the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.
■
EXAMPLE 3 Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION The given series is alternating so we try to verify conditions (i) and (ii)
of the Alternating Series Test.
Unlike the situation in Example 1, it is not obvious that the sequence given by
is decreasing. However, if we consider the related function
, we ﬁnd that

A partial sum 
of any convergent series can be used as an approximation to the
total sum , but this is not of much use unless we can estimate the accuracy of the
approximation. The error involved in using

NOTE The rule that the error (in using 
to approximate ) is smaller than the ﬁrst
neglected term is, in general, valid only for alternating series that satisfy the condi-
tions of the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. The rule does not apply to other
types of series.
ABSOLUTE CONVERGENCE
Given any series 
, we can consider the corresponding series
whose terms are the absolute values of the terms of the original series.
DEFINITION A series 
is called absolutely convergent if the series of
absolute values 
is convergent.
Notice that if 
is a series with positive terms, then 
and so absolute
convergence is the same as convergence.
EXAMPLE 5 The series
is absolutely convergent because
is a convergent -series (
).

sponding series of absolute values is
which is the harmonic series ( -series with 
) and is therefore divergent.
■
DEFINITION A series 
is called conditionally convergent if it is conver-
gent but not absolutely convergent.
Example 6 shows that the alternating harmonic series is conditionally convergent.
Thus it is possible for a series to be convergent but not absolutely convergent. How-
ever, the next theorem shows that absolute convergence implies convergence.
THEOREM If a series 
is absolutely convergent, then it is convergent.
PROOF Observe that the inequality
is true because 
is either 
or 
. If 
is absolutely convergent, then
is convergent, so 
is convergent. Therefore, by the Comparison Test,
is convergent. Then
is the difference of two convergent series and is therefore convergent.
EXAMPLE 7 Determine whether the series
is convergent or divergent.
SOLUTION This series has both positive and negative terms, but it is not alternating. 
(The ﬁrst term is positive, the next three are negative, and the following three are
positive. The signs change irregularly.) We can apply the Comparison Test to the
series of absolute values
Since 
for all , we have
We know that 
is convergent ( -series with 
) and therefore
is convergent by the Comparison Test. Thus the given series 
is abso-
lutely convergent and therefore convergent by Theorem 1.

■It can be proved that if the terms of
an absolutely convergent series are
rearranged in a different order, then the
sum is unchanged. But if a conditionally
convergent series is rearranged, the sum
could be different.

convergent.

(i) If

is absolutely convergent 
(and therefore convergent).
(ii) If 
or
, then the series 
is divergent.
(iii) If

can be drawn about the convergence or divergence of

PROOF
(i) The idea is to compare the given series with a convergent geometric series.
Since 
, we can choose a number such that 
. Since
the ratio 
will eventually be less than ; that is, there exists an integer 
such that

Therefore, if 
, the series 
might converge or it might
diverge. In this case the Ratio Test fails and we must use some other test.
EXAMPLE 8 Test the series 
for absolute convergence.
SOLUTION We use the Ratio Test with 
:
Thus by the Ratio Test the given series is absolutely convergent and therefore 
convergent.

EXAMPLE 9 Test the convergence of the series 
.
SOLUTION Since the terms 
are positive, we don’t need the absolute
value signs.
Since 
, the given series is divergent by the Ratio Test.
■
The following test is convenient to apply when th powers occur. Its proof is sim-
ilar to the proof of the Ratio Test and is left as Exercise 47.
THE ROOT TEST
(i) If 
, then the series 
is absolutely convergent 
(and therefore convergent).
(ii) If 
or 
, then the series 
is 
divergent.
(iii) If 
, the Root Test is inconclusive.
If 
, then part (iii) of the Root Test says that the test gives no infor-
mation. The series 
could converge or diverge. (If 
in the Ratio Test, don’t
try the Root Test because will again be 1. And if 
in the Root Test, don’t try the
Ratio Test because it will fail too.)
EXAMPLE 10 Test the convergence of the series 
.
SOLUTION
Thus the given series converges by the Root Test.

POWER SERIES
A power series is a series of the form
where is a variable and the ’s are constants called the coefﬁcients of the series. For
each ﬁxed , the series 
is a series of constants that we can test for convergence or
divergence. A power series may converge for some values of 
and diverge for other
values of . The sum of the series is a function
whose domain is the set of all for which the series converges. Notice that resembles
a polynomial. The only difference is that 
has inﬁnitely many terms.
For instance, if we take 
for all , the power series becomes the geometric
series
which converges when 
and diverges when 
(see Equation 8.2.5).
More generally, a series of the form
is called a power series in 
or a power series centered at a or a power series
about a. Notice that in writing out the term corresponding to 
in Equations 1
and 2 we have adopted the convention that 
even when 
. Notice
also that when 
all of the terms are 0 for 
and so the power series
always converges when

EXAMPLE 1 For what values of is the series 
convergent?
SOLUTION We use the Ratio Test. If we let 
, as usual, denote the nth term of the
series, then 
. If 
, we have
By the Ratio Test, the series diverges when 
. Thus the given series converges
only when 
.

EXAMPLE 2 For what values of does the series 
converge?
SOLUTION Let 
. Then
By the Ratio Test, the given series is absolutely convergent, and therefore conver-
gent, when 
and divergent when 
. Now
so the series converges when 
and diverges when 
or 
.
The Ratio Test gives no information when 
so we must consider
and 
separately. If we put 
in the series, it becomes 
, the
harmonic series, which is divergent. If 
, the series is 
, which con-
verges by the Alternating Series Test. Thus the given power series converges for
.
■
We will see that the main use of a power series is that it provides a way to repre-
sent some of the most important functions that arise in mathematics, physics, and
chemistry. In particular, the sum of the power series in the next example is called a
Bessel function, after the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel (1784–1846), and the
function given in Exer cise 29 is another example of a Bessel function. In fact, these
functions ﬁrst arose when Bessel solved Kepler’s equation for describing planetary
motion. Since that time, these functions have been applied in many different physical
situations, including the temperature distribution in a circular plate and the shape of a
vibrating drumhead.

SOLUTION Let

Thus by the Ratio Test the given series converges for all values of . In other words,
the domain of the Bessel function 
is 
.
■
Recall that the sum of a series is equal to the limit of the sequence of partial sums.
So when we deﬁne the Bessel function in Example 3 as the sum of a series we mean
that, for every real number ,
where    
The ﬁrst few partial sums are
Figure 1 shows the graphs of these partial sums, which are polynomials. They are all
approximations to the function 
, but notice that the approximations become better
when more terms are included. Figure 2 shows a more complete graph of the Bessel
function.
For the power series that we have looked at so far, the set of values of for which
the series is convergent has always turned out to be an interval [a ﬁnite interval for the 
geometric series and the series in Example 2, the inﬁnite interval 
in Example
3, and a collapsed interval 
in Example 1]. The following theorem, proved
in Appendix C, says that this is true in general.
THEOREM For a given power series 
there are only three 
possibilities:
(i) The series converges only when 
.
(ii) The series converges for all .
(iii) There is a positive number 
such that the series converges if
and diverges if 
.
The number 
in case (iii) is called the radius of convergence of the power series.
By convention, the radius of convergence is 
in case (i) and 
in case (ii).
The interval of convergence of a power series is the interval that consists of all val-
ues of 
for which the series converges. In case (i) the interval consists of just a

single point . In case (ii) the interval is 
. In case (iii) note that the inequality
can be rewritten as 
. When 
is an endpoint of the
interval, that is, 
, anything can happen—the series might converge at one
or both endpoints or it might diverge at both endpoints. Thus in case (iii) there are four
possibilities for the interval of convergence:
The situation is illustrated in Figure 3.
We summarize here the radius and interval of convergence for each of the examples
already considered in this section.
The Ratio Test (or sometimes the Root Test) should be used to determine the radius
of convergence 
in most cases. The Ratio and Root Tests always fail when 
is an
endpoint of the interval of convergence, so the endpoints must be checked with some
other test.
EXAMPLE 4 Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the series
SOLUTION Let 
. Then
By the Ratio Test, the given series converges if 
and diverges if 
.
Thus it converges if 
and diverges if 
. This means that the radius of 
convergence is

We know the series converges in the interval 
, but we must now test for 
convergence at the endpoints of this interval. If 
, the series becomes
which diverges. (Use the Integral Test or simply observe that it is a -series with
.) If 
, the series is
which converges by the Alternating Series Test. Therefore the given power series
converges when 
, so the interval of convergence is 
.

EXAMPLE 5 Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the
series
SOLUTION If 
, then
Using the Ratio Test, we see that the series converges if 
and it
diverges if 
. So it converges if 
and diverges if
. Thus the radius of convergence is 
.
The inequality 
can be written as 
, so we test the series
at the endpoints 
and 1. When 
, the series is
which diverges by the Test for Divergence [
doesn’t converge to 0]. When
, the series is
which also diverges by the Test for Divergence. Thus the series converges only 
when 
, so the interval of convergence is 
.

REPRESENTING FUNCTIONS AS POWER SERIES
In this section we learn how to represent certain types of functions as sums of power
series by manipulating geometric series or by differentiating or integrating such a
series. You might wonder why we would ever want to express a known function as a
sum of inﬁnitely many terms. This strategy is useful for integrating functions that
don’t have elementary antiderivatives, for solving differential equations, and for approx-
imating functions by polynomials. (Scientists do this to simplify the expressions 
they deal with; computer scientists do this to represent functions on calculators and 
computers.)
We start with an equation that we have seen before:
We ﬁrst encountered this equation in Example 5 in Section 8.2, where we obtained it
by observing that the series is a geometric series with 
and 
. But here our
point of view is different. We now regard Equation 1 as expressing the function
as a sum of a power series.
EXAMPLE 1 Express 
as the sum of a power series and ﬁnd the inter-
val of convergence.
SOLUTION Replacing by 
in Equation 1, we have
Because this is a geometric series, it converges when 
, that is, 
, or
. Therefore the interval of convergence is 
. (Of course, we could have
determined the radius of convergence by applying the Ratio Test, but that much
work is unnecessary here.)

we ﬁrst factor a 2 from the denominator:
This series converges when

. So the interval of conver-
gence is

times the function in Example 2, all we
have to do is to multiply that series by

■
DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION OF POWER SERIES
The sum of a power series is a function 
whose domain is the
interval of convergence of the series. We would like to be able to differentiate and inte-
grate such functions, and the following theorem (which we won’t prove) says that we
can do so by differentiating or integrating each individual term in the series, just as we
would for a polynomial. This is called term-by-term differentiation and integration.
THEOREM If the power series 
has radius of convergence
, then the function 
deﬁned by
is differentiable (and therefore continuous) on the interval 
and

The radii of convergence of the power series in Equations (i) and (ii) are both .

NOTE 1 Equations (i) and (ii) in Theorem 2 can be rewritten in the form
(iii)
(iv) 
We know that, for ﬁnite sums, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives and
the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. Equations (iii) and (iv) assert that the
same is true for inﬁnite sums, provided we are dealing with power series. (For other
types of series of functions the situation is not as simple; see Exercise 38.)
NOTE 2 Although Theorem 2 says that the radius of convergence remains the same
when a power series is differentiated or integrated, this does not mean that the inter-
val of convergence remains the same. It may happen that the original series converges
at an endpoint, whereas the differentiated series diverges there. (See Exercise 39.)
EXAMPLE 4 In Example 3 in Section 8.5 we saw that the Bessel function
is deﬁned for all . Thus by Theorem 2, 
is differentiable for all and its deriva-
tive is found by term-by-term differentiation as follows:

same as the radius of convergence of the original series, namely,

■This example demonstrates one way
in which power series representations
are useful. Integrating 
by
hand is incredibly difﬁcult. Different
computer algebra systems return differ-
ent forms of the answer, but they are all
extremely complicated. (If you have a
CAS, try it yourself.) The inﬁnite series
answer that we obtain in Exam ple 8 is
actually much easier to deal with than
the ﬁnite answer provided by a CAS.

TAYLOR AND MACLAURIN SERIES
In the preceding section we were able to ﬁnd power series representations for a cer-
tain restricted class of functions. Here we investigate more general problems: Which
functions have power series representations? How can we ﬁnd such representations?
We start by supposing that 
is any function that can be represented by a power
series:
Let’s try to determine what the coefﬁcients 
must be in terms of . To begin, notice
that if we put 
in Equation 1, then all terms after the ﬁrst one are 0 and we get
By Theorem 8.6.2, we can differentiate the series in Equation 1 term by term:
and substitution of 
in Equation 2 gives
Now we differentiate both sides of Equation 2 and obtain
Again we put 
in Equation 3. The result is
Let’s apply the procedure one more time. Differentiation of the series in Equation 3
gives
and substitution of 
in Equation 4 gives
By now you can see the pattern. If we continue to differentiate and substitute 
,
we obtain
Solving this equation for the th coefﬁcient 
This formula remains valid even for 
if we adopt the conventions that 
and
. Thus we have proved the following theorem.

THEOREM If 
has a power series representation (expansion) at , that 
is, if
then its coefﬁcients are given by the formula
Substituting this formula for 
back into the series, we see that if
has a power
series expansion at , then it must be of the following form.
The series in Equation 6 is called the Taylor series of the function f at a (or about
a or centered at a). For the special case 
the Taylor series becomes
This case arises frequently enough that it is given the special name Maclaurin series.
NOTE We have shown that if
can be represented as a power series about , then
is equal to the sum of its Taylor series. But there exist functions that are not equal
to the sum of their Taylor series. An example of such a function is given in Exercise 70.

■The Taylor series is named after the
English mathematician Brook Taylor
(1685–1731) and the Maclaurin series is
named in honor of the Scottish mathemati-
cian Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746) despite
the fact that the Maclaurin series is really
just a special case of the Taylor series. 
But the idea of representing particular
functions as sums of power series goes
back to Newton, and the general Taylor
series was known to the Scottish mathe-
matician James Gregory in 1668 and to the
Swiss mathematician John Bernoulli in the
1690s. Taylor was apparently unaware of
the work of Gregory and Bernoulli when
he published his discoveries on series in
1715 in his book Methodus incrementorum
directa et inversa. Maclaurin series are
named after Colin Maclaurin because he
popularized them in his calculus textbook
Treatise of Fluxions published in 1742.

The conclusion we can draw from Theorem 5 and Example 1 is that if
has a
power series expansion at 0, then
So how can we determine whether 
does have a power series representation?
Let’s investigate the more general question: Under what circumstances is a func-
tion equal to the sum of its Taylor series? In other words, if 
has derivatives of all
orders, when is it true that
As with any convergent series, this means that 
is the limit of the sequence of par-
tial sums. In the case of the Taylor series, the partial sums are
Notice that 
is a polynomial of degree 
called the nth-degree Taylor polynomial
of f at a. For instance, for the exponential function 
, the result of Example 1
shows that the Taylor polynomials at 0 (or Maclaurin polynomials) with

3 are
The graphs of the exponential function and these three Taylor polynomials are drawn

In trying to show that 
for a speciﬁc function , we usually use
the expression in the next theorem.
TAYLOR’S FORMULA If 
has 
derivatives in an interval 
that 
contains the number , then for 
in 
there is a number strictly between
and 
such that the remainder term in the Taylor series can be expressed as
NOTE 1 For the special case 
, if we put 
and 
in Taylor’s For-
mula, we get 
, which is the Mean Value Theorem. In fact,
Theorem 9 can be proved by a method similar to the proof of the Mean Value Theo-
rem. The proof is given at the end of this section.
NOTE 2 Notice that the remainder term
is very similar to the terms in the Taylor series except that 
is evaluated at
instead of at . All we can say about the number is that it lies somewhere between
and . The expression for 
in Equation 10 is known as Lagrange’s form of the
remainder term.
NOTE 3 In Section 8.8 we will explore the use of Taylor’s Formula in approximat-
ing functions. Our immediate use of it is in conjunction with Theorem 8.
In applying Theorems 8 and 9 it is often helpful to make use of the following fact.
for every real number x
This is true because we know from Example 1 that the series 
converges for all
and so its th term approaches 0.
EXAMPLE 2 Prove that

Formula is

the number as a sum of an inﬁnite series:

We have two power series expansions for 
, the Maclaurin series in Equation 12
and the Taylor series in Equation 14. The ﬁrst is better if we are interested in values
of near 0 and the second is better if is near 2.

SOLUTION Instead of computing derivatives and substituting in Equation 7, it’s
easier to multiply the series for 
(Equation 17) by :
■
The power series that we obtained by indirect methods in Examples 5 and 6 and 
in Section 8.6 are indeed the Taylor or Maclaurin series of the given functions 
because Theorem 5 asserts that, no matter how we obtain a power series representa-
tion 
, it is always true that

ﬁcients are uniquely determined.

Therefore the Maclaurin series of

This series is called the binomial series. Notice that if is a nonnegative integer,
then the terms are eventually 0 and so the series is ﬁnite. For other values of none
of the terms is 0 and so we can try the Ratio Test. If the

The traditional notation for the coefﬁcients in the binomial series is
and these numbers are called the binomial coefﬁcients.
The following theorem states that 
is equal to the sum of its Maclaurin
series. It is possible to prove this by showing that the remainder term 
approaches
0, but that turns out to be quite difﬁcult. The proof outlined in Exercise 69 is much
easier.
THE BINOMIAL SERIES If is any real number and 
, then
Although the binomial series always converges when 
, the question of
whether or not it converges at the endpoints, 
, depends on the value of . It turns
out that the series converges at 1 if 
and at both endpoints if 
. Notice
that if 
is a positive integer and 
, then the expression for 
contains a factor
, so 
 0 for 
. This means that the series terminates and reduces to the
ordinary Binomial Theorem when is a positive integer. (See Reference Page 1.)
EXAMPLE 8 Find the Maclaurin series for the function 
and its
radius of convergence.
SOLUTION We write 
in a form where we can use the binomial series:
Using the binomial series with 
and with replaced by

We know from 
that this series converges when

the radius of convergence is

CHAPTER 8
SERIES
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
We collect in the following table, for future reference, some important Maclaurin
series that we have derived in this section and the preceding one.
One reason that Taylor series are important is that they enable us to integrate func-
tions that we couldn’t previously handle. In fact, in the introduction to this chapter we
mentioned that Newton often integrated functions by ﬁrst expressing them as power
series and then integrating the series term by term. The function 
can’t be
integrated by techniques discussed so far because its antiderivative is not an elemen-
tary function (see Section 6.4). In the following example we use Newton’s idea to inte-
grate this function.
EXAMPLE 9
(a) Evaluate 
as an inﬁnite series.
(b) Evaluate 
correct to within an error of 
.
SOLUTION
(a) First we ﬁnd the Maclaurin series for 
. Although it’s possible to use
the direct method, let’s ﬁnd it simply by replacing with 
in the series for
given in the table of Maclaurin series. Thus, for all values of x,
Now we integrate term by term:
This series converges for all because the original series for 
converges for all .

MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF POWER SERIES
If power series are added or subtracted, they behave like polynomials (Theorem 8.2.8
shows this). In fact, as the following example illustrates, they can also be multiplied
and divided like polynomials. We ﬁnd only the ﬁrst few terms because the calculations
for the later terms become tedious and the initial terms are the most important ones.

8.8
APPLICATIONS OF TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS
In this section we explore two types of applications of Taylor polynomials. First we
look at how they are used to approximate functions––computer scientists like them
because polynomials are the simplest of functions. Then we investigate how physicists
and engineers use them in such ﬁelds as relativity, electric dipoles, the velocity of
water waves, and building highways across a desert.
APPROXIMATING FUNCTIONS BY POLYNOMIALS
Suppose that 
is equal to the sum of its Taylor series at :
In Section 8.7 we introduced the notation 
for the th partial sum of this series
and called it the th-degree Taylor polynomial of 
at . Thus
Since 
is the sum of its Taylor series, we know that 
as 
and so 
can be used as an approximation to :
.
Notice that the ﬁrst-degree Taylor polynomial
is the same as the linearization of f at a that we discussed in Section 2.8. Notice also
that 
and its derivative have the same values at a that
and 
have. In general, it can
be shown that the derivatives of 
at agree with those of up to and including deriv-
atives of order .

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

To illustrate these ideas let’s take another look at the graphs of 
and its ﬁrst
few Taylor polynomials, as shown in Figure 1. The graph of 
is the tangent line to
at 
; this tangent line is the best linear approximation to 
near 
. The
graph of 
is the parabola 
, and the graph of 
is the cubic curve
, which is a closer ﬁt to the exponential curve 
than
. The next Taylor polynomial 
would be an even better approximation, and so on.
The values in the table in the margin give a numerical demonstration of the conver-
gence of the Taylor polynomials 
to the function 
. We see that when x  0.2
the convergence is very rapid, but when x  3 it is somewhat slower. In fact, the far-
ther x is from 0, the more slowly 
converges to 
.
When using a Taylor polynomial 
to approximate a function , we have to ask
the questions: How good an approximation is it? How large should we take to be in
order to achieve a desired accuracy? To answer these questions we need to look at the
absolute value of the remainder:
There are three possible methods for estimating the size of the error:
1. If a graphing device is available, we can use it to graph 
and thereby
estimate the error.
2. If the series happens to be an alternating series, we can use the Alternating
Series Estimation Theorem.
3. In all cases we can use Taylor’s Formula (8.7.9), which says that
where is a number that lies between 
and .

(a) Approximate the function 
by a Taylor polynomial of degree 2

(b) The Taylor series is not alternating when 
, so we can’t use the Alternating
Series Estimation Theorem in this example. But using Taylor’s Formula we can
write
where lies between 
and . In order to estimate the error we note that if
, then 
, so 
and therefore 
.
Also, since 
, we have
and so
Thus if 
, the approximation in part (a) is accurate to within 
.
■
Let’s use a graphing device to check the calculation in Example 1. Figure 2 shows
that the graphs of 
and 
are very close to each other when 
is near
8. Figure 3 shows the graph of 
computed from the expression
We see from this graph that
when 
. Thus the error estimate from graphical methods is slightly better
than the error estimate from Taylor’s Formula in this case.
EXAMPLE 2
(a) What is the maximum error possible in using the approximation 
when 
? Use this approximation to ﬁnd 
correct to six decimal
places.
(b) For what values of is this approximation accurate to within 
?
SOLUTION
(a) Notice that the Maclaurin series
is alternating for all nonzero values of , and the successive terms decrease in size
because 
, so we can use the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. The
error in approximating 
by the ﬁrst three terms of its Maclaurin series is at most

To ﬁnd

Thus, correct to six decimal places, 
.
(b) The error will be smaller than

Solving this inequality for , we get
So the given approximation is accurate to within 
when

■
What if we had used Taylor’s Formula to solve Example 2? The remainder term is
(Note that 
.) But 
, so 
and we get the same
estimates as with the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.
What about graphical methods? Figure 4 shows the graph of

when 
. This is the same esti-
mate that we obtained in Example 2. For part (b) we want 
, so we
graph both 
and 
in Figure 5. By placing the cursor on the
right intersection point we ﬁnd that the inequality is satisﬁed when 
. Again
this is the same estimate that we obtained in the solution to Example 2.
If we had been asked to approximate 
instead of 
in Example 2, it
would have been wise to use the Taylor polynomials at 
(instead of 
)
because they are better approximations to 
for values of 
close to 
. Notice
that

(or 
radians) and the derivatives of 
are easy to com-
pute at

to the sine curve. You can see that as 
increases, 
is a good approximation to
on a larger and larger interval.
One use of the type of calculation done in Examples 1 and 2 occurs in calculators
and computers. For instance, when you press the 
or 
key on your calculator, or
when a computer programmer uses a subroutine for a trigonometric or exponential or
Bessel function, in many machines a polynomial approximation is calculated. The
polynomial is often a Taylor polynomial that has been modiﬁed so that the error is
spread more evenly throughout an interval. 
APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS
Taylor polynomials are also used frequently in physics. In order to gain insight into
an equation, a physicist often simpliﬁes a function by considering only the ﬁrst two or
three terms in its Taylor series. In other words, the physicist uses a Taylor polynomial
as an approximation to the function. Taylor’s Formula can then be used to gauge the
accuracy of the approximation. The following example shows one way in which this
idea is used in special relativity. Other applications are explored in Exercises 24–28.
EXAMPLE 3 In Einstein’s theory of special relativity the mass of an object mov-
ing with velocity is
where 
is the mass of the object when at rest and is the speed of light. The
kinetic energy of the object is the difference between its total energy and its energy
at rest:

23. A car is moving with speed 20 ms and acceleration 2 ms

of a conducting wire is the reciprocal of
the conductivity and is measured in units of ohm-meters

the values of 
(called the temperature coefﬁcient) and
(the resistivity at 
C) for various metals. Except at very
low temperatures, the resis tivity varies almost linearly with
tem perature and so it is common to approximate the
expression for 
by its ﬁrst- or second-degree Taylor
polynomial at

approximations.

9.1
PARAMETRIC CURVES
Imagine that a particle moves along the curve 
shown in Figure 1. It is impossible to
describe 
by an equation of the form 
because 
fails the Vertical Line Test.
But the - and -coordinates of the particle are functions of time and so we can write
and 
. Such a pair of equations is often a convenient way of describ-
ing a curve and gives rise to the following deﬁnition.
Suppose that 
and 
are both given as functions of a third variable 
(called a
param eter) by the equations
(called parametric equations). Each value of determines a point 
, which we
can plot in a coordinate plane. As varies, the point 
varies and
traces out a curve , which we call a parametric curve. The parameter does not nec-
essarily represent time and, in fact, we could use a letter other than for the parame-
ter. But in many applications of parametric curves, does denote time and therefore
we can interpret 
as the position of a particle at time .
EXAMPLE 1 Sketch and identify the curve deﬁned by the parametric equations
SOLUTION Each value of gives a point on the curve, as shown in the table. For
instance, if 
, then 
, 
and so the corresponding point is 
. In
Figure 2 we plot the points 
determined by several values of the parameter
and we join them to produce a curve.

PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS AND
POLAR COORDINATES
So far we have described plane curves by giving as a function of 
or as a function of 
or by giving a relation between and that defines implicitly as a function of
. In this chapter we discuss two new methods for describing curves.
Some curves, such as the cycloid, are best handled when both and are given in terms of a third
variable called a parameter 
. Other curves, such as the cardioid, have their most
convenient description when we use a new coordinate system, called the polar coordinate system.

A particle whose position is given by the parametric equations moves along the
curve in the direction of the arrows as increases. Notice that the consecutive points
marked on the curve appear at equal time intervals but not at equal distances. That is
because the particle slows down and then speeds up as increases.
It appears from Figure 2 that the curve traced out by the particle may be a 
parab ola. This can be conﬁrmed by eliminating the parameter as follows. We
obtain 
from the second equation and substitute into the ﬁrst equation.
This gives
and so the curve represented by the given parametric equations is the parabola
.
■
No restriction was placed on the parameter in Example 1, so we assumed that
could be any real number. But sometimes we restrict to lie in a ﬁnite interval. For
instance, the parametric curve
shown in Figure 3 is the part of the parabola in Example 1 that starts at the point
and ends at the point 
. The arrowhead indicates the direction in which the curve
is traced as increases from 0 to 4.
In general, the curve with parametric equations
has initial point
and terminal point
.
EXAMPLE 2 What curve is represented by the following parametric equations?
SOLUTION If we plot points, it appears that the curve is a circle. We can conﬁrm
this impression by eliminating 
Observe that
Thus the point 
moves on the unit circle 
. Notice that in this 
example the parameter can be interpreted as the angle (in radians) shown in Fig-
ure 4. As increases from 0 to 
, the point 
moves once
around the circle in the counterclockwise direction starting from the point 
.
■
EXAMPLE 3 What curve is represented by the given parametric equations?
SOLUTION Again we have
so the parametric equations again represent the unit circle 
. But as
increases from 0 to 
, the point 
starts at 
and moves
twice around the circle in the clockwise direction as indicated in Figure 5.

■This equation in and describes 
where the particle has been, but it 
doesn’t tell us when the particle was at a
particular point. The parametric equations
have an advantage––they tell us when the
particle was at a point. They also indicate
the direction of the motion.

SECTION 9.1  PARAMETRIC CURVES

Examples 2 and 3 show that different sets of parametric equations can represent the
same curve. Thus we distinguish between a curve, which is a set of points, and a para-
metric curve, in which the points are traced in a particular way.
EXAMPLE 4 Find parametric equations for the circle with center 
and radius .
SOLUTION If we take the equations of the unit circle in Example 2 and multiply
the expressions for and by , we get 
, 
. You can verify that
these equations represent a circle with radius and center the origin traced counter-
clockwise. We now shift units in the -direction and units in the -direction and
obtain parametric equations of the circle (Figure 6) with center 
and radius :
■
EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the curve with parametric equations 
, 
.
SOLUTION Observe that 
and so the point 
moves on the
parabola 
. But note also that, since 
, we have 
, 
so the parametric equations represent only the part of the parabola for which
. Since 
is periodic, the point 
moves back and
forth inﬁnitely often along the parabola from 
to 
. (See Figure 7.)
■
GRAPHING DEVICES
Most graphing calculators and computer graphing programs can be used to graph
curves deﬁned by parametric equations. In fact, it’s instructive to watch a parametric
curve being drawn by a graphing calculator because the points are plotted in order as
the corresponding parameter values increase.
EXAMPLE 6 Use a graphing device to graph the curve 
.
SOLUTION If we let the parameter be 
, then we have the equations
Using these parametric equations to graph the curve, we obtain Figure 8. It would
be possible to solve the given equation 
for as four functions of
and graph them individually, but the parametric equations provide a much easier
method.
■
In general, if we need to graph an equation of the form 
, we can use the
parametric equations
Notice also that curves with equations 
(the ones we are most familiar with—
graphs of functions) can also be regarded as curves with parametric equations

Graphing devices are particularly useful for sketching complicated curves. For
instance, the curves shown in Figures 9, 10, and 11 would be virtually impossible to
produce by hand.
THE CYCLOID
EXAMPLE 7 The curve traced out by a point 
on the circumference of a circle as
the circle rolls along a straight line is called a cycloid (see Figure 12). If the circle
has radius and rolls along the -axis and if one position of 
is the origin, ﬁnd
parametric equations for the cycloid.
SOLUTION We choose as parameter the angle of rotation 
of the circle
when 
is at the origin). Suppose the circle has rotated through 
radians. Because
the circle has been in contact with the line, we see from Figure 13 that the distance
it has rolled from the origin is
Therefore the center of the circle is 
. Let the coordinates of 
be 
. 
Then from Figure 13 we see that
Therefore parametric equations of the cycloid are
One arch of the cycloid comes from one rotation of the circle and so is described by
. Although Equations 1 were derived from Figure 13, which illustrates
the case 
, it can be seen that these equations are still valid for other
values of 
(see Exercise 33).

Although it is possible to eliminate the parameter 
from Equations 1, the result-

with as the parametric equations.

One of the ﬁrst people to study the cycloid was Galileo, who proposed that bridges
be built in the shape of cycloids and who tried to ﬁnd the area under one arch of a
cycloid. Later this curve arose in connection with the brachistochrone problem: Find
the curve along which a particle will slide in the shortest time (under the inﬂuence of
gravity) from a point 
to a lower point 
not directly beneath . The Swiss math-
ematician John Bernoulli, who posed this problem in 1696, showed that among all
possible curves that join 
to , as in Figure 14, the particle will take the least time
sliding from 
to 
if the curve is part of an inverted arch of a cycloid.
The Dutch physicist Huygens had already shown that the cycloid is also the sol-
ution to the tautochrone problem; that is, no matter where a particle 
is placed 
on an inverted cycloid, it takes the same time to slide to the bottom (see Figure 15).
Huygens proposed that pendulum clocks (which he invented) should swing in cycloi-
dal arcs because then the pendulum takes the same time to make a complete oscilla-
tion whether it swings through a wide or a small arc.

CALCULUS WITH PARAMETRIC CURVES
Having seen how to represent curves by parametric equations, we now apply the meth-
ods of calculus to these parametric curves. In particular, we solve problems involving
tangents, areas, and arc length.
TANGENTS
Suppose 
and are differentiable functions and we want to ﬁnd the tangent line at a
point on the parametric curve 
, 
where is also a differentiable func-
tion of . Then the Chain Rule gives
If 
, we can solve for 
:
Equation 1 (which you can remember by thinking of canceling the 
’s) enables us
to ﬁnd the slope 
of the tangent to a parametric curve without having to elimi-
nate the parameter . We see from 
that the curve has a horizontal tangent when
(provided that 
) and it has a vertical tangent when
(provided that 
). This information is useful for sketching parametric curves.
As we know from Chapter 3, it is also useful to consider 
. This can be
found by replacing by 
in Equation 1:
EXAMPLE 1 A curve 
is deﬁned by the parametric equations 
, 
(a) Show that 
has two tangents at the point (3, 0) and ﬁnd their equations.
(b) Find the points on 
where the tangent is horizontal or vertical.
(c) Determine where the curve is concave upward or downward.
(d) Sketch the curve.
SOLUTION
(a) Notice that 
when 
or 
. Therefore
the point 
on 
arises from two values of the parameter, 
and 
.
This indicates that 
crosses itself at

When 
, both 
and

and is tra-
versed once as increases from 
to , then we can adapt the earlier formula by using
the Sub stitution Rule for Deﬁnite Integrals as follows:
EXAMPLE 3 Find the area under one arch of the cycloid

■The result of Example 3 says that the
area under one arch of the cycloid is
three times the area of the rolling circle
that generates the cycloid (see Example 7
in Section 9.1). Galileo guessed this
result but it was ﬁrst proved by the
French mathematician Roberval and the
Italian mathematician Torricelli.

Notice that the formula in Theorem 5 is consistent with the general formulas
and 
of Section 7.4.

Section 9.1,
then 
and 
, so Theorem 5 gives
as expected. If, on the other hand, we use the representation given in Example 3 in
Section 9.1,
then 
, 
, and the integral in Theorem 5 gives
| Notice that the integral gives twice the arc length of the circle because as increases
from 0 to 
, the point 
traverses the circle twice. In general, when
ﬁnding the length of a curve 
from a parametric representation, we have to be
careful to ensure that 
is traversed only once as increases from 
to .

POLAR COORDINATES
A coordinate system represents a point in the plane by an ordered pair of numbers
called coordinates. Usually we use Cartesian coordinates, which are directed distances
from two perpendicular axes. Here we describe a coordinate system introduced by
Newton, called the polar coordinate system, which is more convenient for many 
purposes.
We choose a point in the plane that is called the pole (or origin) and is labeled .
Then we draw a ray (half-line) starting at 
called the polar axis. This axis is usually
drawn horizontally to the right and corresponds to the positive -axis in Cartesian
coordinates.
If 
is any other point in the plane, let be the distance from 
to 
and let 
be
the angle (usually measured in radians) between the polar axis and the line 
as in
Figure 1. Then the point 
is represented by the ordered pair 
and ,
are called
polar coordinates of . We use the convention that an angle is positive if measured
in the counterclockwise direction from the polar axis and negative in the clockwise
direction. If
, then 
and we agree that 
represents the pole for any
value of .
We extend the meaning of polar coordinates 
to the case in which is nega-
tive by agreeing that, as in Figure 2, the points 
and 
lie on the same line
through 
and at the same distance 
from , but on opposite sides of . If 
,
the point 
lies in the same quadrant as ; if 
, it lies in the quadrant on the
opposite side of the pole. Notice that 
represents the same point as 
.

SOLUTION The points are plotted in Figure 3. In part (d) the point 
is
located three units from the pole in the fourth quadrant because the angle 
is in
the second quadrant and 
is negative.
■
In the Cartesian coordinate system every point has only one representation, but in
the polar coordinate system each point has many representations. For instance, the
point 
in Example 1(a) could be written as 
or 
or
. (See Figure 4.)
In fact, since a complete counterclockwise rotation is given by an angle 2 , the
point represented by polar coordinates 
is also represented by
where 
is any integer.
The connection between polar and Cartesian coordinates can be seen from Figure 5,
in which the pole corresponds to the origin and the polar axis coincides with the pos-
itive -axis. If the point 
has Cartesian coordinates 
and polar coordinates 
,
then, from the ﬁgure, we have
and so

where

coordinates are known. To ﬁnd and

which can be deduced from Equations 1 or simply read from Figure 5.
EXAMPLE 2 Convert the point 
from polar to Cartesian coordinates.
SOLUTION Since 
and 
, Equations 1 give
Therefore the point is 
in Cartesian coordinates.
■
EXAMPLE 3 Represent the point with Cartesian coordinates 
in terms of
polar coordinates.
SOLUTION If we choose to be positive, then Equations 2 give
Since the point 
lies in the fourth quadrant, we can choose 
or
. Thus one possible answer is 
; another is 
.
■
NOTE Equations 2 do not uniquely determine 
when 
and 
are given because, 
as 
increases through the interval 
, each value of 
occurs twice.
Therefore, in converting from Cartesian to polar coordinates, it’s not good enough just
to ﬁnd and 
that satisfy Equations 2. As in Example 3, we must choose 
so that
the point 
lies in the correct quadrant.
POLAR CURVES
The graph of a polar equation
, or more generally 
, consists of
all points 
that have at least one polar representation 
whose coordinates satisfy
the equation.
EXAMPLE 4 What curve is represented by the polar equation 
?
SOLUTION The curve consists of all points 
with 
. Since represents the
distance from the point to the pole, the curve 
represents the circle with center
and radius . In general, the equation 
represents a circle with center 
and
radius 
. (See Figure 6.)

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the polar curve 
.
SOLUTION This curve consists of all points 
such that the polar angle 
is
1 radian. It is the straight line that passes through 
and makes an angle of 1 radian
with the polar axis (see Figure 7). Notice that the points 
on the line with
are in the ﬁrst quadrant, whereas those with 
are in the third quadrant.
■
EXAMPLE 6
(a) Sketch the curve with polar equation 
.
(b) Find a Cartesian equation for this curve.
SOLUTION
(a) In Figure 8 we ﬁnd the values of for some convenient values of 
and plot the
corresponding points 
. Then we join these points to sketch the curve, which
appears to be a circle. We have used only values of 
between 0 and , since if we
let 
increase beyond , we obtain the same points again.
(b) To convert the given equation into a Cartesian equation we use Equations 1 
and 2. From 
we have 
, so the equation 
becomes 
, which gives
or    
Completing the square, we obtain
which is an equation of a circle with center 
and radius 1.

EXAMPLE 7 Sketch the curve 
.
SOLUTION Instead of plotting points as in Example 6, we ﬁrst sketch the graph of
in Cartesian coordinates in Figure 10 by shifting the sine curve up
one unit. This enables us to read at a glance the values of that correspond to
increasing values of . For instance, we see that as 
increases from 0 to 
, (the
distance from ) increases from 1 to 2, so we sketch the corresponding part of the
polar curve in Figure 11(a). As
increases from 
to , Figure 10 shows that
decreases from 2 to 1, so we sketch the next part of the curve as in Figure 11(b). As 
increases from 
to 
, decreases from 1 to 0 as shown in part (c). Finally, 
as 
increases from 
to 
, increases from 0 to 1 as shown in part (d). If 
we let 
increase beyond 
or decrease beyond 0, we would simply re trace our
path. Putting together the parts of the curve from Figure 11(a)–(d), we sketch the
complete curve in part (e). It is called a cardioid because it’s shaped like a heart.
EXAMPLE 8 Sketch the curve 
.
SOLUTION As in Example 7, we ﬁrst sketch 
, 
, in Cartesian
coordinates in Figure 12. As 
increases from 0 to 
, Figure 12 shows that
decreases from 1 to 0 and so we draw the corresponding portion of the polar curve
in Figure 13 (indicated by !). As 
increases from 
to 
, goes from 0 to 
.
This means that the distance from 
increases from 0 to 1, but instead of being in
the ﬁrst quadrant this portion of the polar curve (indicated by @) lies on the opposite
side of the pole in the third quadrant. The remainder of the curve is drawn in a simi-
lar fashion, with the arrows and numbers indicating the order in which the portions
are traced out. The resulting curve has four loops and is called a four-leaved rose.

PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS AND POLAR COORDINATES

TANGENTS TO POLAR CURVES
To ﬁnd a tangent line to a polar curve 
we regard 
as a parameter and write
its parametric equations as
Then, using the method for ﬁnding slopes of parametric curves (Equation 9.2.1) and
the Product Rule, we have
We locate horizontal tangents by ﬁnding the points where 
(provided that
). Likewise, we locate vertical tangents at the points where
(provided that 
).
Notice that if we are looking for tangent lines at the pole, then 
and Equation 3
simpliﬁes to
For instance, in Example 8 we found that 
when 
or 
.
This means that the lines 
and 
(or 
and 
) are tangent
lines to 
at the origin.
EXAMPLE 9
(a) For the cardioid 
of Example 7, ﬁnd the slope of the tangent line 
when 
.
(b) Find the points on the cardioid where the tangent line is horizontal or vertical.

(b) Observe that
Therefore there are horizontal tangents at the points 
, 
,
and vertical tangents at 
and 
. When 
, both 
and
are 0, so we must be careful. Using l’Hospital’s Rule, we have
By symmetry,
Thus there is a vertical tangent line at the pole (see Figure 14).
■
NOTE Instead of having to remember Equation 3, we could employ the method
used to derive it. For instance, in Example 9 we could have written
Then we have
which is equivalent to our previous expression.
GRAPHING POLAR CURVES WITH GRAPHING DEVICES
Although it’s useful to be able to sketch simple polar curves by hand, we need to use
a graphing calculator or computer when we are faced with a curve as complicated as
the one shown in Figure 15.
Some graphing devices have commands that enable us to graph polar curves 
directly. With other machines we need to convert to parametric equations ﬁrst. In this
case we take the polar equation 
and write its parametric equations as
Some machines require that the parameter be called rather than .

EXAMPLE 10 Graph the curve 
.
SOLUTION Let’s assume that our graphing device doesn’t have a built-in polar
graphing command. In this case we need to work with the corresponding parametric
equations, which are
In any case we need to determine the domain for . So we ask ourselves: How many
complete rotations are required until the curve starts to repeat itself? If the answer 
is , then
and so we require that 
be an even multiple of . This will ﬁrst occur when
. Therefore we will graph the entire curve if we specify that 
.
Switching from 
to , we have the equations
and Figure 16 shows the resulting curve. Notice that this rose has 16 loops.

AREAS AND LENGTHS IN POLAR COORDINATES
In this section we develop the formula for the area of a region whose boundary is
given by a polar equation. We need to use the formula for the area of a sector of a 
circle
where, as in Figure 1, is the radius and 
is the radian measure of the central angle.
Formula 1 follows from the fact that the area of a sector is proportional to its central
angle: 
. (See also Exercise 69 in Section 6.2.)
Let 
be the region, illustrated in Figure 2, bounded by the polar curve 
and by the rays 
and 
, where is a positive continuous function and where
. We divide the interval 
into subintervals with endpoints 
, 
, 
, . . . , 
and equal width 
. The rays 
then divide 
into 
smaller
regions with central angle 
. If we choose 
in the th subinterval
, then the area 
of the th region is approximated by the area of the sector
of a circle with central angle 
and radius 
. (See Figure 3.)

Thus from Formula 1 we have
and so an approximation to the total area 
of 
is
It appears from Figure 3 that the approximation in 
improves as 
. But the
sums in 
are Riemann sums for the function 
, so
It therefore appears plausible (and can in fact be proved) that the formula for the area
of the polar region 
is
Formula 3 is often written as

. Note the similarity between Formulas 1 and 4.
When we apply Formula 3 or 4 it is helpful to think of the area as being swept out
by a rotating ray through 
that starts with angle 
and ends with angle .
EXAMPLE 1 Find the area enclosed by one loop of the four-leaved rose

SOLUTION The curve 
was sketched in Example 8 in Section 9.3.
Notice from Figure 4 that the region enclosed by the right loop is swept out by a ray
that rotates from 
to

in Formula 4 are
determined by ﬁnding the points of intersection of the two curves. They intersect

Since the region is symmetric about the vertical axis

Example 2 illustrates the procedure for ﬁnding the area of the region bounded by
two polar curves. In general, let 
be a region, as illustrated in Figure 6, that is 
bounded by curves with polar equations

, 
, and 
, where

CAUTION The fact that a single point has many representations in polar coordi-
nates sometimes makes it difﬁcult to ﬁnd all the points of intersection of two polar
curves. For instance, it is obvious from Figure 5 that the circle and the cardioid have
three points of intersection; however, in Example 2 we solved the equations
and 
and found only two such points, 
and 
.
The origin is also a point of intersection, but we can’t ﬁnd it by solving the equations
of the curves because the origin has no single representation in polar coordinates that
satisﬁes both equations. Notice that, when represented as 
or 
, the origin
satisﬁes 
and so it lies on the circle; when represented as 
, it sat-
isﬁes 
and so it lies on the cardioid. Think of two points moving along
the curves as the parameter value increases from 0 to 
. On one curve the origin is
reached at 
and 
; on the other curve it is reached at 
. The points
don’t collide at the origin because they reach the origin at different times, but the
curves intersect there nonetheless.
Thus, to ﬁnd all points of intersection of two polar curves, it is recommended that
you draw the graphs of both curves. It is especially convenient to use a graphing cal-
culator or computer to help with this task.
EXAMPLE 3 Find all points of intersection of the curves 
and 
.
SOLUTION If we solve the equations 
and 
, we get 
and
therefore

, 
, 
. Thus the values of 
between 0 and
that satisfy both equations are 
, 
, 
, 
. We have found four
points of inter section: 
, 
, and 
.
However, you can see from Figure 7 that the curves have four other points of
inter section—namely, 
, 
, 
, and 
. These can be
found using symmetry or by noticing that another equation of the circle is
and then solving the equations 
and 
.

ARC LENGTH
To ﬁnd the length of a polar curve 
, 
, we regard 
as a parameter
and write the parametric equations of the curve as
Using the Product Rule and differentiating with respect to , we obtain
so, using 
, we have
Assuming that 
is continuous, we can use Formula 9.2.5 to write the arc length as
Therefore the length of a curve with polar equation 
, 
, is
EXAMPLE 4 Find the length of the cardioid 
.
SOLUTION The cardioid is shown in Figure 8. (We sketched it in Example 7 in
Section 9.3.) Its full length is given by the parameter interval 
, so
Formula 5 gives 
We could evaluate this integral by multiplying and dividing the integrand by
, or we could use a computer algebra system. In any event, we ﬁnd
that the length of the cardioid is

CONIC SECTIONS IN POLAR COORDINATES
In your previous study of conic sections, parabolas were deﬁned in terms of a focus
and directrix whereas ellipses and hyperbolas were deﬁned in terms of two foci. After
reviewing those deﬁnitions and equations, we present a more uniﬁed treatment of all
three types of conic sections in terms of a focus and directrix. Furthermore, if we place
the focus at the origin, then a conic section has a simple polar equation. In Chapter 10
we will use the polar equation of an ellipse to derive Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.
CONICS IN CARTESIAN COORDINATES
Here we provide a brief reminder of what you need to know about conic sections. A
more thorough review can be found on the website www.stewartcalculus.com. (Click
on Review: Conic Sections.)
Recall that a parabola is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a
ﬁxed point 
(called the focus) and a ﬁxed line (called the directrix). This deﬁnition
is illustrated by Figure 1. Notice that the point halfway between the focus and the 
directrix lies on the parabola; it is called the vertex. The line through the focus per-
pendicular to the directrix is called the axis of the parabola.
A parabola has a very simple equation if its vertex is placed at the origin and its
directrix is parallel to the -axis or -axis. If the focus is on the -axis at the point
, then the directrix has the equation 
and an equation of the parabola is
. [See parts (a) and (b) of Figure 2.] If the focus is on the -axis at 
,
then the directrix is 
and an equation is 
as in parts (c) and (d).
An ellipse is the set of points in a plane the sum of whose distances from two ﬁxed
points 
and 
is a constant. These two ﬁxed points are called the foci (plural of
focus).

CHAPTER 9
PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS AND POLAR COORDINATES
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
An ellipse has a simple equation if we place the foci on the -axis at the points
and 
as in Figure 3 so that the origin is halfway between the foci. If the
sum of the distances from a point on the ellipse to the foci is 
, then the points 
and 
where the ellipse meets the -axis are called the vertices. The -intercepts
are 
, where 
. (See Figure 4.)
The ellipse
has foci 
, where 
, and vertices 
.
If the foci of an ellipse are located on the -axis at 
, then we can ﬁnd its
equation by interchanging and in 
.
A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane the difference of whose distances
from two ﬁxed points 
and 
(the foci) is a constant. Notice that the deﬁnition 
of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse; the only change is that the sum of dis-
tances has become a difference of distances. If the foci are on the -axis at 
and the difference of distances is 
, then the equation of the hyperbola is
, where 
. The -intercepts are 
and the points
and 
are the vertices of the hyperbola. There is no -intercept and the
hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches. (See Figure 5.)
When we draw a hyperbola it is useful to ﬁrst draw its asymptotes, which are 
the dashed lines 
and 
shown in Figure 5. Both branches of 
the hyperbola approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the
asymptotes.
The hyperbola
has foci 
, where 
, vertices 
, and asymptotes
.
If the foci of a hyperbola are on the -axis, then by reversing the roles of 
and
we get the graph shown in Figure 6.
We have given the standard equations of the conic sections, but any of them can be
shifted by replacing 
by 
and 
by 
. For instance, an ellipse with center
has an equation of the form
CONICS IN POLAR COORDINATES
In the following theorem we show how all three types of conic sections can be char-
acterized in terms of a focus and directrix.

THEOREM Let 
be a ﬁxed point (called the focus) and be a ﬁxed line
(called the directrix) in a plane. Let be a ﬁxed positive number (called the
eccentricity). The set of all points 
in the plane such that
(that is, the ratio of the distance from 
to the distance from is the con -
stant ) is a conic section. The conic is
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
PROOF Notice that if the eccentricity is 
, then 
and so the given
condition simply becomes the deﬁnition of a parabola.
Let us place the focus 
at the origin and the directrix parallel to the -axis and
units to the right. Thus the directrix has equation 
and is perpendicular to the
polar axis. If the point 
has polar coordinates 
, we see from Figure 7 that
Thus the condition 
, or 
, becomes
If we square both sides of this polar equation and convert to rectangular coordinates, 
we get
or
After completing the square, we have
If 
, we recognize Equation 5 as the equation of an ellipse. In fact, it is of the
form

This shows that
and conﬁrms that the focus as deﬁned in Theorem 3 means the same as the focus
deﬁned earlier. It also follows from Equations 6 and 7 that the eccentricity is given
by
If 
, then 
and we see that Equation 5 represents a hyperbola. Just as
we did before, we could rewrite Equation 5 in the form
and see that
By solving Equation 4 for , we see that the polar equation of the conic shown in
Fig ure 7 can be written as
If the directrix is chosen to be to the left of the focus as 
, or if the directrix is
chosen to be parallel to the polar axis as 
, then the polar equation of the conic
is given by the following theorem, which is illustrated by Figure 8. (See Exercises
19–21.)
THEOREM A polar equation of the form

and whose directrix is the line

SOLUTION Using Theorem 8 with

we see that the equation of the parabola is

SOLUTION Dividing numerator and denominator by 3, we write the equation as
From Theorem 8 we see that this represents an ellipse with 
. Since 
, 
we have

,
. So the vertices have polar coordinates 
and 
. The ellipse is
sketched in Figure 9.

EXAMPLE 3 Sketch the conic

SOLUTION Writing the equation in the form
we see that the eccentricity is 
and the equation therefore represents a hyper-
bola. Since 
, 
and the directrix has equation 
. The vertices occur
when 
and 
, so they are 
and 
, which can be writ-
ten as 
. It is also useful to plot the -intercepts. These occur when 
, ;
in both cases 
. For additional accuracy we could draw the asymptotes. Note
that

Thus the asymptotes are parallel to the rays 
and

bola is sketched in Figure 10.
■
In Figure 11 we use a computer to sketch a number of conics to demonstrate the
effect of varying the eccentricity . Notice that when is close to 0 the ellipse is nearly
circular, whereas it becomes more elongated as 
. When

conic is a parabola.

10.1
THREE-DIMENSIONAL COORDINATE SYSTEMS
To locate a point in a plane, two numbers are necessary. We know that any point 
in the plane can be represented as an ordered pair 
of real numbers, where 
is
the -coordinate and 
is the -coordinate. For this reason, a plane is called two-
dimensional. To locate a point in space, three numbers are required. We represent any
point in space by an ordered triple 
of real numbers.
In order to represent points in space, we ﬁrst choose a ﬁxed point 
(the origin)
and three directed lines through 
that are perpendicular to each other, called the
coordinate axes and labeled the -axis, -axis, and -axis. Usually we think of the 
- and -axes as being horizontal and the -axis as being vertical, and we draw the ori-
entation of the axes as in Figure 1. The direction of the -axis is determined by the
right-hand rule as illustrated in Figure 2: If you curl the ﬁngers of your right hand
around the -axis in the direction of a 
counterclockwise rotation from the positive
-axis to the positive -axis, then your thumb points in the positive direction of the 
-axis.
The three coordinate axes determine the three coordinate planes illustrated in Fig-
ure 3(a). The 
-plane is the plane that contains the - and -axes; the 
-plane con-
tains the - and -axes; the 
-plane contains the - and -axes. These three coordinate
planes divide space into eight parts, called octants. The ﬁrst octant, in the fore-
ground, is determined by the positive axes.
Because many people have some difﬁculty visualizing diagrams of three-dimen-
sional ﬁgures, you may ﬁnd it helpful to do the following [see Figure 3(b)]. Look at
any bottom corner of a room and call the corner the origin. The wall on your left is in

VECTORS AND THE 
GEOMETRY OF SPACE
In this chapter we introduce vectors and coordinate systems for three-dimensional space. This will be
the setting for the study of functions of two variables in Chapter 11 because the graph of such a func-
tion is a surface in space. In this chapter we will see that vectors provide particularly simple descriptions
of lines, planes, and curves. We will also use vector-valued functions to describe the motion of objects
through space. In particular, we will use them to derive Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.

the 
-plane, the wall on your right is in the 
-plane, and the ﬂoor is in the 
-plane.
The -axis runs along the intersection of the ﬂoor and the left wall. The -axis runs
along the intersection of the ﬂoor and the right wall. The -axis runs up from the ﬂoor
toward the ceiling along the intersection of the two walls. You are situated in the ﬁrst
octant, and you can now imagine seven other rooms situated in the other seven octants
(three on the same ﬂoor and four on the ﬂoor below), all connected by the common
corner point .
Now if 
is any point in space, let be the (directed) distance from the 
-plane to
let 
be the distance from the 
-plane to 
and let 
be the distance from the 
-plane to . We represent the point
by the ordered triple
of real numbers
and we call , , and the coordinates of ; 
is the -coordinate, 
is the -coordi-
nate, and is the -coordinate. Thus to locate the point 
we can start at the ori-
gin 
and move 
units along the -axis, then 
units parallel to the -axis, and then
units parallel to the -axis as in Figure 4.
The point 
determines a rectangular box as in Figure 5. If we drop a per-
pendicular from 
to the 
-plane, we get a point 
with coordinates 
called
the projection of 
on the 
-plane. Similarly, 
and 
are the projec-
tions of 
on the 
-plane and 
-plane, respectively.
As numerical illustrations, the points 
and 
are plotted in
Figure 6.
The Cartesian product 
is the set of all 
ordered triples of real numbers and is denoted by 
. We have given a one-to-one cor-
respondence between points 
in space and ordered triples 
in 
. It is called
a three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system. Notice that, in terms of coor-
dinates, the ﬁrst octant can be described as the set of points whose coordinates are all
positive.
In two-dimensional analytic geometry, the graph of an equation involving and
is a curve in 
. In three-dimensional analytic geometry, an equation in , , and rep-
resents a surface in 
.

(b) The equation 
represents the set of all points in 
whose -coordinate 
is 5. This is the vertical plane that is parallel to the 
-plane and ﬁve units to the
right of it as in Figure 7(b).
■
NOTE When an equation is given, we must understand from the context whether it
represents a curve in
or a surface in
. In Example 1,
represents a plane in
, but of course 
can also represent a line in 
if we are dealing with two-
dimensional analytic geometry. See Figure 7, parts (b) and (c).
In general, if is a constant, then 
represents a plane parallel to the
-plane,
is a plane parallel to the 
-plane, and 
is a plane parallel to the 
-plane.
In Figure 5, the faces of the rectangular box are formed by the three coordinate 
planes 
(the
-plane),
(the
-plane), and
(the
-plane), and the
planes
,
, and 
.
EXAMPLE 2 Describe and sketch the surface in 
represented by the 
equation 
.
SOLUTION The equation represents the set of all points in 
whose - and 
-coordinates are equal, that is, 
. This is a vertical plane
that intersects the 
-plane in the line 
, 
. The portion of this plane that
lies in the ﬁrst octant is sketched in Figure 8.
■
The familiar formula for the distance between two points in a plane is easily
extended to the following three-dimensional formula.
DISTANCE FORMULA IN THREE DIMENSIONS The distance 
between
the points 
and 
is
To see why this formula is true, we construct a rectangular box as in Figure 9,
where 
and 
are opposite vertices and the faces of the box are parallel to the coor-
dinate planes. If 
and 
are the vertices of the box indicated in

SOLUTION The inequalities
can be rewritten as
so they represent the points 
whose distance from the origin is at least 1 
and at most 2. But we are also given that 
, so the points lie on or below the

the spheres

VECTORS
The term vector is used by scientists to indicate a quantity (such as displacement or
velocity or force) that has both magnitude and direction. A vector is often represented
by an arrow or a directed line segment. The length of the arrow represents the magni-
tude of the vector and the arrow points in the direction of the vector. We denote a 
vector by printing a letter in boldface 
or by putting an arrow above the letter 
For instance, suppose a particle moves along a line segment from point 
to point
. The corresponding displacement vector , shown in Figure 1, has initial point
(the tail) and terminal point
(the tip) and we indicate this by writing 
AB
l.
Notice that the vector 
CD
l has the same length and the same direction as 
even
though it is in a different position. We say that 
and are equivalent (or equal) and
we write 
. The zero vector, denoted by 0, has length . It is the only vector with
no speciﬁc direction.
COMBINING VECTORS
Suppose a particle moves from 
, so its displacement vector is AB
l. Then the par-
ticle changes direction and moves from 
, with displacement vector BC
l as in
Figure 2. The combined effect of these displacements is that the particle has moved
from 
. The resulting displacement vector AC
lis called the sum of AB
l and BC
land
we write
AC
l
AB
l
BC
l
In general, if we start with vectors and , we ﬁrst move so that its tail coincides
with the tip of 
and deﬁne the sum of 
and

DEFINITION OF VECTOR ADDITION If 
and 
are vectors positioned so the
initial point of 
is at the terminal point of , then the sum
is the vector
from the initial point of 
to the terminal point of .
The deﬁnition of vector addition is illustrated in Figure 3. You can see why this deﬁ -
nition is sometimes called the Triangle Law.
In Figure 4 we start with the same vectors 
and as in Figure 3 and draw another 
copy of 
with the same initial point as . Completing the parallelogram, we see that
. This also gives another way to construct the sum: If we place 
and
so they start at the same point, then 
lies along the diagonal of the parallelo-
gram with 
and 
as sides. (This is called the Parallelogram Law.)
EXAMPLE 1 Draw the sum of the vectors 
shown in Figure 5.
SOLUTION First we translate 
and place its tail at the tip of , being careful to
draw a copy of 
that has the same length and direction. Then we draw the vector
[see Figure 6(a)] starting at the initial point of 
and ending at the terminal
point of the copy of .
Alternatively, we could place 
so it starts where 
starts and construct 
by
the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 6(b).
■
It is possible to multiply a vector by a real number . (In this context we call the
real number a scalar to distinguish it from a vector.) For instance, we want 
to be
the same vector as 
, which has the same direction as 
but is twice as long. In
general, we multiply a vector by a scalar as follows.
DEFINITION OF SCALAR MULTIPLICATION If is a scalar and 
is a vector,
then the scalar multiple
is the vector whose length is 
times the length
of 
and whose direction is the same as 
if 
and is opposite to 
if
. If 
or

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

This deﬁnition is illustrated in Figure 7. We see that real numbers work like scal-
ing factors here; that’s why we call them scalars. Notice that two nonzero vectors 
are parallel if they are scalar multiples of one another. In particular, the vector
has the same length as 
but points in the opposite direction. We call it
the negative of .
By the difference
of two vectors we mean
So we can construct 
by ﬁrst drawing the negative of , 
, and then adding it
to
by the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 8(a). Alternatively, since
the vector 
, when added to , gives . So we could construct 
as in Fig-
 ure 8(b) by means of the Triangle Law.
EXAMPLE 2 If 
are the vectors shown in Figure 9, draw 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst draw the vector 
pointing in the direction opposite to
and twice as long. We place it with its tail at the tip of 
and then use the Triangle
Law to draw 
as in Figure 10.
■
COMPONENTS
For some purposes it’s best to introduce a coordinate system and treat vectors alge-
braically. If we place the initial point of a vector at the origin of a rectangular coor-
dinate system, then the terminal point of 
has coordinates of the form 
or
, depending on whether our coordinate system is two- or three-dimensional
(see Figure 11). These coordinates are called the components of 
and we write
or      
We use the notation 
for the ordered pair that refers to a vector so as not to
confuse it with the ordered pair 
that refers to a point in the plane.
For instance, the vectors shown in Figure 12 are all equivalent to the vector
OP
l
whose terminal point is 
. What they have in common is that the
terminal point is reached from the initial point by a displacement of three units to the
right and two upward. We can think of all these geometric vectors as representations
of the algebraic vector 
. The particular representation OP
l from the origin
to the point 
is called the position vector of the point .

In three dimensions, the vector 
OP
l
is the position vector of the
point 
. (See Figure 13.) Let’s consider any other representation AB
l of 
, where the initial point is 
and the terminal point is 
. Then 
we must have 
, 
, and 
and so 
,
, and

Given the points

tation AB

SOLUTION By 
, the vector corresponding to AB
l is
■
The magnitude or length of the vector is the length of any of its representations
and is denoted by the symbol 
or 
. By using the distance formula to compute
the length of a segment 
, we obtain the following formulas.
The length of the two-dimensional vector 
is
The length of the three-dimensional vector 
is
How do we add vectors algebraically? Figure 14 shows that if 
and
, then the sum is 
, at least for the case where
the components are positive. In other words, to add algebraic vectors we add their
components. Similarly, to subtract vectors we subtract components. From the similar
triangles in Figure 15 we see that the components of 
are 
and 
. So to multi-
ply a vector by a scalar we multiply each component by that scalar.

■Vectors in 
dimensions are used to
list various quantities in an organized
way. For instance, the components of a
six-dimensional vector
might represent the prices of six dif fer-
ent ingredients required to make a partic-
ular product. Four-dimensional vectors
are used in relativity theory,
where the ﬁrst three compo nents specify
a position in space and the fourth repre-
sents time.

We can see why Property 2 (the associative law) is true by looking at Figure 16 and
applying the Triangle Law several times: The vector PQ
l is obtained either by ﬁrst con-
structing a  b and then adding c or by adding a to the vector b  c.
Three vectors in

A unit vector is a vector whose length is 1. For instance, , , and are all unit vec-
tors. In general, if 
, then the unit vector that has the same direction as 
is
In order to verify this we let 
. Then

APPLICATIONS
Vectors are useful in many aspects of physics and engineering. In Section 10.9 we will
see how they describe the velocity and acceleration of objects moving in space. Here
we look at forces.
A force is represented by a vector because it has both a magnitude (measured in
pounds or newtons) and a direction. If several forces are acting on an object, the resul -
tant force experienced by the object is the vector sum of these forces.
EXAMPLE 7 A 100-lb weight hangs from two wires as shown in Figure 19. Find the
tensions (forces) 
and 
in both wires and their magnitudes.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst express 
and 
in terms of their horizontal and vertical
components. From Figure 20 we see that
The resultant 
of the tensions counterbalances the weight 
and so we must
have
Thus
Equating components, we get
Solving the ﬁrst of these equations for

■GIBBS
Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903), a profes-
sor of mathematical physics at Yale College,
published the ﬁrst book on vectors, Vector
Analysis, in 1881. More complicated objects,
called quaternions, had earlier been invented
by Hamilton as mathematical tools for
describing space, but they weren’t easy for
scientists to use. Quaternions have a scalar
part and a vector part. Gibb’s idea was to
use the vector part separately. Maxwell and
Heaviside had similar ideas, but Gibb’s
approach has proved to be the most conven-
ient way to study space.

SECTION 10.3  THE DOT PRODUCT

10.3
THE DOT PRODUCT
So far we have added two vectors and multiplied a vector by a scalar. The question
arises: Is it possible to multiply two vectors so that their product is a useful quantity?
One such product is the dot product, whose deﬁnition follows. Another is the cross
product, which is discussed in the next section.
DEFINITION If 
and 
, then the dot prod-
uct of 
and 
is the number 
given by
Thus to ﬁnd the dot product of and we multiply corresponding components and
add. The result is not a vector. It is a real number, that is, a scalar. For this reason, the
dot product is sometimes called the scalar product (or inner product). Although
Deﬁnition 1 is given for three-dimensional vectors, the dot product of two-dimension-
al vectors is deﬁned in a similar fashion:
EXAMPLE 1
■
The dot product obeys many of the laws that hold for ordinary products of real
numbers. These are stated in the following theorem.

and 
is a scalar, then

The scalar projection of

deﬁned to be the signed magnitude of the vector projection, which is the number

The equation

scalar projection of

the component of

The vector projection is this scalar projection times the unit vector in the direction
of :
■
One use of projections occurs in physics in calculating work. In Section 7.6 we
deﬁned the work done by a constant force
in moving an object through a distance
as
, but this applies only when the force is directed along the line of motion
of the object. Suppose, however, that the constant force is a vector 
PR
l pointing
in some other direction as in Figure 5. If the force moves the object from 
to , then
the displacement vector is 
PQ
l. The work done by this force is deﬁned to be the
product of the component of the force along 
and the distance moved:
But then, from Theorem 3, we have
Thus the work done by a constant force 
is the dot product 
, where 
is the dis-
placement vector.
EXAMPLE 6 A wagon is pulled a distance of 100 m along a horizontal path by a
constant force of 70 N. The handle of the wagon is held at an angle of 
above the
horizontal. Find the work done by the force.
SOLUTION If 
are the force and displacement vectors, as pictured in Fig-
ure 6, then the work done is
■
EXAMPLE 7 A force is given by a vector 
and moves a particle
from the point 
to the point 
. Find the work done.
SOLUTION The displacement vector is 
PQ
l
, so by Equation 8, the
work done is
If the unit of length is meters and the magnitude of the force is measured in newtons,
then the work done is 36 J.

THE CROSS PRODUCT
The cross product
of two vectors 
and , unlike the dot product, is a vector.
For this reason it is also called the vector product. Note that 
is deﬁned only
when 
and 
are three-dimensional vectors.
DEFINITION If 
and 
, then the cross 
product of 
and 
is the vector
This may seem like a strange way of deﬁning a product. The reason for the partic-
ular form of Deﬁnition 1 is that the cross product deﬁned in this way has many useful
properties, as we will soon see. In particular, we will show that the vector 
is
perpendicular to both 
and .
In order to make Deﬁnition 1 easier to remember, we use the notation of determi-
nants. A determinant of order 2 is deﬁned by
For example,
A determinant of order 3 can be deﬁned in terms of second-order determinants as 
follows:
Observe that each term on the right side of Equation 2 involves a number 
in the ﬁrst
row of the determinant, and 
is multiplied by the second-order determinant obtained
from the left side by deleting the row and column in which 
appears. Notice also the
minus sign in the second term. For example,
If we now rewrite Deﬁnition 1 using second-order determinants and the standard
basis vectors , , and , we see that the cross product of

■HAMILTON
The cross product was invented by the Irish
mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton
(1805–1865), who had created a precursor 
of vectors, called quaternions. When he was
ﬁve years old Hamilton could read Latin,
Greek, and Hebrew. At age eight he added
French and Italian and when ten he could
read Arabic and Sanskrit. At the age of 21,
while still an undergraduate at Trinity Col-
lege in Dublin, Hamilton was appointed 
Professor of Astronomy at the university 
and Royal Astronomer of Ireland!

In view of the similarity between Equations 2 and 3, we often write
Although the ﬁrst row of the symbolic determinant in Equation 4 consists of vectors,
if we expand it as if it were an ordinary determinant using the rule in Equation 2, we
obtain Equation 3. The symbolic formula in Equation 4 is probably the easiest way of
remembering and computing cross products.

A similar computation shows that 
. Therefore 
is orthogonal
to both 
and .
If and 
are represented by directed line segments with the same initial point (as
in Figure 1), then Theorem 5 says that the cross product 
points in a direction
perpendicular to the plane through 
and . It turns out that the direction of 
is
given by the right-hand rule: If the ﬁngers of your right hand curl in the direction of
a rotation (through an angle less than 
) from to , then your thumb points in the
direction of 
.
Now that we know the direction of the vector 
, the remaining thing we need
to complete its geometric description is its length 
. This is given by the fol-
lowing theorem.
THEOREM If

and 
(so 
), then
PROOF From the deﬁnitions of the cross product and length of a vector, we have
(by Theorem 10.3.3)
Taking square roots and observing that 
because 
when
, we have
Since a vector is completely determined by its magnitude and direction, we can
now say that 
is the vector that is perpendicular to both and , whose orienta-
tion is determined by the right-hand rule, and whose length is 
. In fact,
that is exactly how physicists deﬁne
.

The geometric interpretation of Theorem 6 can be seen by looking at Figure 2. If
and 
are represented by directed line segments with the same initial point, then they
determine a parallelogram with base 
, altitude 
, and area
Thus we have the following way of interpreting the magnitude of a cross product.
The length of the cross product 
is equal to the area of the parallelogram
determined by 
and .

We compute the cross product of these vectors:

So the vector 
is perpendicular to the given plane. Any nonzero
scalar multiple of this vector, such as

plane.

Thus the cross product is not commutative. Also
whereas
So the associative law for multiplication does not usually hold; that is, in general,
|
However, some of the usual laws of algebra do hold for cross products. The following
theorem summarizes the properties of vector products.
THEOREM If , , and are vectors and is a scalar, then
1. a  b  b  a
2. (ca)  b  c(a  b)  a  (cb)
3. a  (b  c)  a  b  a  c
4. (a  b)  c  a  c  b  c
5.
6.
These properties can be proved by writing the vectors in terms of their components 
and using the deﬁnition of a cross product. We give the proof of Property 5 and leave
the remaining proofs as exercises.
PROOF OF PROPERTY 5 If 
, 
, and 
,
then
TRIPLE PRODUCTS
The product 
that occurs in Property 5 is called the scalar triple product
of the vectors , , and . Notice from Equation 9 that we can write the scalar triple
product as a determinant:
The geometric signiﬁcance of the scalar triple product can be seen by considering
the parallelepiped determined by the vectors , , and . (See Figure 3.) The area of
the base parallelogram is 
. If 
is the angle between 
and 
, then
the height 
of the parallelepiped is

.) Therefore the volume of the parallelepiped is
Thus we have proved the following formula.
The volume of the parallelepiped determined by the vectors , , and is
the magnitude of their scalar triple product:
If we use the formula in 
and discover that the volume of the parallelepiped 
determined by a, b, and c is 0, then the vectors must lie in the same plane; that is, they
are coplanar.
EXAMPLE 5 Use the scalar triple product to show that the vectors 
,
, and 
are coplanar.
SOLUTION We use Equation 10 to compute their scalar triple product:
Therefore by 
the volume of the parallelepiped determined by , , and is 0.
This means that , , and are coplanar.

The product 
that occurs in Property 6 is called the vector triple prod-
uct of
, , and . Property 6 will be used to derive Kepler’s First Law of planetary
motion in Section 10.9. Its proof is left as Exercise 50.
TORQUE
The idea of a cross product occurs often in physics. In particular, we consider a force
acting on a rigid body at a point given by a position vector . (For instance, if we
tighten a bolt by applying a force to a wrench as in Figure 4, we produce a turning
effect.) The torque 
(relative to the origin) is deﬁned to be the cross product of the
position and force vectors
and measures the tendency of the body to rotate about the origin. The direction of the
torque vector indicates the axis of rotation. According to Theorem 6, the magnitude of
the torque vector is

EQUATIONS OF LINES AND PLANES
A line in the 
-plane is determined when a point on the line and the direction of the
line (its slope or angle of inclination) are given. The equation of the line can then be
written using the point-slope form.
Likewise, a line 
in three-dimensional space is determined when we know a point
on 
and the direction of . In three dimensions the direction of a line is
conveniently described by a vector, so we let be a vector parallel to . Let 
be an arbitrary point on 
and let 
and be the position vectors of 
and 
(that is,
they have representations OP
A and OP
A). If 
is the vector with representation P P
A, 
as in Figure 1, then the Triangle Law for vector addition gives 
. But, since
and are parallel vectors, there is a scalar such that 
. Thus 
which is a vector equation of . Each value of the parameter gives the position vec-
tor of a point on . In other words, as varies, the line is traced out by the tip of the
vector . As Figure 2 indicates, positive values of correspond to points on 
that lie
on one side of 
, whereas negative values of correspond to points that lie on the other
side of 
If the vector that gives the direction of the line 
is written in component form as
, then we have 
. We can also write 
and
, so the vector equation 
becomes
Two vectors are equal if and only if corresponding components are equal. Therefore
we have the three scalar equations:

eter gives a point

EXAMPLE 1
(a) Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line that passes through

so

gives the point

■
The vector equation and parametric equations of a line are not unique. If we change
the point or the parameter or choose a different parallel vector, then the equations
change. For instance, if, instead of 
, we choose the point 
in Example 1,
then the parametric equations of the line become
Or, if we stay with the point 
but choose the parallel vector 
, we
arrive at the equations
In general, if a vector 
is used to describe the direction of a line ,
then the numbers , , and are called direction numbers of . Since any vector par-
allel to 
could also be used, we see that any three numbers proportional to , , and
could also be used as a set of direction numbers for .
Another way of describing a line is to eliminate the parameter from Equations 2.
If none of , , or is , we can solve each of these equations for , equate the results,
and obtain
These equations are called symmetric equations of . Notice that the numbers ,

that appear in the denominators of Equations 3 are direction numbers of ,

In general, the procedure of Example 2 shows that direction numbers of the line

Often, we need a description, not of an entire line, but of just a line segment. How,
for instance, could we describe the line segment 
in Example 2? If we put 
in the parametric equations in Example 2(a), we get the point 
and if we 
put

. So the line segment 
is described by the parametric
equations

In general, we know from Equation 1 that the vector equation of a line through the
(tip of the) vector 
in the direction of a vector is 
. If the line also passes
through (the tip of) , then we can take 
and so its vector equation is
The line segment from 
to 
is given by the parameter interval 
.
The line segment from
to 
is given by the vector equation
EXAMPLE 3 Show that the lines 
and 
with parametric equations
are skew lines; that is, they do not intersect and are not parallel (and therefore do
not lie in the same plane).
SOLUTION The lines are not parallel because the corresponding vectors
and 
are not parallel. (Their components are not proportional.) If 
and
had a point of intersection, there would be values of and such that
But if we solve the ﬁrst two equations, we get 
and 
, and these values
don’t satisfy the third equation. Therefore there are no values of and that satisfy
the three equations, so 
and 
do not intersect. Thus 
and 
are skew lines.

PLANES
Although a line in space is determined by a point and a direction, a plane in space is
more difﬁcult to describe. A single vector parallel to a plane is not enough to convey
the “direction” of the plane, but a vector perpendicular to the plane does completely
specify its direction. Thus a plane in space is determined by a point 
in the
plane and a vector 
that is orthogonal to the plane. This orthogonal vector 
is called
a normal vector. Let 
be an arbitrary point in the plane, and let 
and be
the position vectors of 
and . Then the vector 
is represented by P P
A. 
(See Figure 6.) The normal vector 
is orthogonal to every vector in the given plane.
In particular, 
is orthogonal to 
and so we have
which can be rewritten as
Either Equation 5 or Equation 6 is called a vector equation of the plane.

To obtain a scalar equation for the plane, we write 
, 
, and
. Then the vector equation 
becomes

Equation 7 is the scalar equation of the plane through 
with normal
vector
.

SOLUTION Putting 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
in Equa -
tion 7, we see that an equation of the plane is
or
To ﬁnd the -intercept we set 
in this equation and obtain 
. Simi-
larly, the -intercept is 4 and the -intercept is 3. This enables us to sketch the por-
tion of the plane that lies in the ﬁrst octant (see Figure 7).
■
By collecting terms in Equation 7 as we did in Example 4, we can rewrite the equa-
tion of a plane as
where 
. Equation 8 is called a linear equation in , , and .
Conversely, it can be shown that if , , and 
are not all 0, then the linear equation
represents a plane with normal vector 
. (See Exercise 59.)

Since both

lie in the plane, their cross product

Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel. For instance, the planes
and 
are parallel because their normal vectors
are 
and 
and 
. If two planes are not paral-
lel, then they intersect in a straight line and the angle between the two planes is de-
ﬁned as the acute angle between their normal vectors (see angle 
in Figure 9).
EXAMPLE 6
(a) Find the angle between the planes 
and 
.
(b) Find symmetric equations for the line of intersection 
of these two planes.
SOLUTION
(a) The normal vectors of these planes are
and so, if 
is the angle between the planes,
(b) We ﬁrst need to ﬁnd a point on . For instance, we can ﬁnd the point where the
line intersects the 
-plane by setting 
in the equations of both planes. This
gives the equations 
and 
, whose solution is 
, 
. So
the point 
lies on .
Now we observe that, since 
lies in both planes, it is perpendicular to both of
the normal vectors. Thus a vector 
parallel to 
is given by the cross product
and so the symmetric equations of 
can be written as

EXAMPLE 7 Find a formula for the distance 
from a point 
to the 
plane 
.
SOLUTION Let 
be any point in the given plane and let 
be the vector
corresponding to P P
A. Then
From Figure 11 you can see that the distance 
from 
to the plane is equal to the
absolute value of the scalar projection of 
onto the normal vector 
.

EXAMPLE 8 Find the distance between the parallel planes 
and 
.
SOLUTION First we note that the planes are parallel because their normal vectors
and 
are parallel. To ﬁnd the distance 
between the planes,
we choose any point on one plane and calculate its distance to the other plane. In
particular, if we put 
in the equation of the ﬁrst plane, we get 
and
so 
is a point in this plane. By Formula 9, the distance between 
and
the plane 
is
So the distance between the planes is

10.6
CYLINDERS AND QUADRIC SURFACES
We have already looked at two special types of surfaces—planes (in Section 10.5) and
spheres (in Section 10.1). Here we investigate two other types of surfaces—cylinders
and quadric surfaces.
In order to sketch the graph of a surface, it is useful to determine the curves of
intersection of the surface with planes parallel to the coordinate planes. These curves
are called traces (or cross-sections) of the surface.
CYLINDERS
A cylinder is a surface that consists of all lines (called rulings) that are parallel to a
given line and pass through a given plane curve.
EXAMPLE 1 Sketch the graph of the surface 
.
SOLUTION Notice that the equation of the graph, 
, doesn’t involve y. This
means that any vertical plane with equation 
(parallel to the 
-plane) inter-
sects the graph in a curve with equation 
. So these vertical traces are parab-
olas. Figure 1 shows how the graph is formed by taking the parabola 
in the 
-plane and moving it in the direction of the y-axis. The graph is a surface, called a

parabolic cylinder, made up of inﬁnitely many shifted copies of the same parabola.
Here the rulings of the cylinder are parallel to the y-axis.
■
We noticed that the variable y is missing from the equation of the cylinder in Exam -
ple 1. This is typical of a surface whose rulings are parallel to one of the coordinate
axes. If one of the variables x, y, or is missing from the equation of a surface, then
the surface is a cylinder.
EXAMPLE 2 Identify and sketch the surfaces.
(a) 
(b)
SOLUTION
(a) Since is missing and the equations 
, 
represent a circle with
radius 1 in the plane 
, the surface 
is a circular cylinder whose
axis is the -axis (see Figure 2). Here the rulings are vertical lines.
(b) In this case x is missing and the surface is a circular cylinder whose axis is the
x-axis (see Figure 3). It is obtained by taking the circle 
, 
in the 
-plane and moving it parallel to the x-axis.
■
|
NOTE When you are dealing with surfaces, it is important to recognize that an
equation like 
represents a cylinder and not a circle. The trace of the
cylinder 
in the 
-plane is the circle with equations 
, 
.
QUADRIC SURFACES
A quadric surface is the graph of a second-degree equation in three variables , ,
and . The most general such equation is
where , , 
are constants, but by translation and rotation it can be brought
into one of the two standard forms
or    
Quadric surfaces are the counterparts in three dimensions of the conic sections in the
plane. (See Section 9.5 for a review of conic sections.)

EXAMPLE 3 Use traces to sketch the quadric surface with equation
SOLUTION By substituting 
, we ﬁnd that the trace in the xy-plane is
, which we recognize as an equation of an ellipse. In general, the
horizontal trace in the plane 
is
which is an ellipse, provided that 
, that is, 
.
Similarly, the vertical traces are also ellipses:
Figure 4 shows how drawing some traces indicates the shape of the surface. It’s
called an ellipsoid because all of its traces are ellipses. Notice that it is symmetric
with respect to each coordinate plane; this is a reﬂection of the fact that its equation
involves only even powers of x, y, and .
■
EXAMPLE 4 Use traces to sketch the surface 
.
SOLUTION If we put 
, we get 
, so the 
-plane intersects the surface in
a parabola. If we put 
(a constant), we get 
. This means that if we 
slice the graph with any plane parallel to the 
-plane, we obtain a parabola that
opens upward. Similarly, if 
, the trace is 
, which is again a
parabola that opens upward. If we put 
, we get the horizontal traces
, which we recognize as a family of ellipses. Knowing the shapes of
the traces, we can sketch the graph in Figure 5. Because of the elliptical and para-
bolic traces, the quadric surface 
is called an elliptic paraboloid.
■
EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the surface 
.
SOLUTION The traces in the vertical planes 
are the parabolas 
,
which open upward. The traces in 
are the parabolas 
, which
open downward. The horizontal traces are 
, a family of hyperbolas. We
draw the families of traces in Figure 6, and we show how the traces appear when
placed in their correct planes in Figure 7.

In Figure 8 we ﬁt together the traces from Figure 7 to form the surface
, a hyperbolic paraboloid. Notice that the shape of the surface near the
origin resembles that of a saddle. This surface will be investigated further in Section
11.7 when we discuss saddle points.

but the traces in the

The idea of using traces to draw a surface is employed in three-dimensional graph-
ing software for computers. In most such software, traces in the vertical planes
and 
are drawn for equally spaced values of , and parts of the graph are elimi-
nated using hidden line removal. Table 1 shows computer-drawn graphs of the six
basic types of quadric surfaces in standard form. All surfaces are symmetric with
respect to the -axis. If a quadric surface is symmetric about a different axis, its equa-
tion changes accordingly.

VECTOR FUNCTIONS AND SPACE CURVES
In general, a function is a rule that assigns to each element in the domain an element
in the range. A vector-valued function, or vector function, is simply a function whose
domain is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors. We are most inter-
ested in vector functions 
whose values are three-dimensional vectors. This means
that for every number in the domain of 
there is a unique vector in 
denoted by
. If 
, 
, and 
are the components of the vector 
, then , , and 
are
real-valued functions called the component functions of and we can write
We use the letter to denote the independent variable because it represents time in
most applications of vector functions.
EXAMPLE 1 If
then the component functions are
By our usual convention, the domain of consists of all values of for which the
expression for 
is deﬁned. The expressions , 
, and 
are all deﬁned
when 
and 
. Therefore the domain of is the interval 
.
■
The limit of a vector function 
is deﬁned by taking the limits of its component
functions as follows.
If 
, then
provided the limits of the component functions exist.
Equivalently, we could have used an 
deﬁnition (see Exercise 70). Limits of vec-
tor functions obey the same rules as limits of real-valued functions (see Exercise 69).

EXAMPLE 2 Find 
, where 
.
SOLUTION According to Deﬁnition 1, the limit of r is the vector whose compo-
nents are the limits of the component functions of r:
(by Equation 1.4.6)
■
A vector function is continuous at a if
In view of Deﬁnition 1, we see that is continuous at 
if and only if its component
functions , , and 
are continuous at .
There is a close connection between continuous vector functions and space curves.
Suppose that , , and 
are continuous real-valued functions on an interval . Then
the set 
of all points 
in space, where
and varies throughout the interval , is called a space curve. The equations in 
are
called parametric equations of C and is called a parameter. We can think of 
as
being traced out by a moving particle whose position at time is 
. If 
we now consider the vector function 
, then 
is the position
vector of the point 
on 
. Thus any continuous vector function
deﬁnes a space curve 
that is traced out by the tip of the moving vector 
, as shown
in Figure 1.
EXAMPLE 3 Describe the curve deﬁned by the vector function
SOLUTION The corresponding parametric equations are
which we recognize from Equations 10.5.2 as parametric equations of a line passing
through the point 
and parallel to the vector 
. Alternatively, we
could observe that the function can be written as 
, where
and 
, and this is the vector equation of a line as given by Equation 10.5.1.
■
Plane curves can also be represented in vector notation. For instance, the curve
given by the parametric equations 
and 
(see Example 1 in Sec-
tion 9.1) could also be described by the vector equation
where

EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the curve whose vector equation is
SOLUTION The parametric equations for this curve are
Since 
, the curve must lie on the circular cylinder
. The point 
lies directly above the point 
, which moves 
counterclockwise around the circle 
in the xy-plane. (The projection of
the curve onto the 
-plane has vector equation 
. See Exam-
ple 2 in Section 9.1.) Since 
, the curve spirals upward around the cylinder as
increases. The curve, shown in Figure 2, is called a helix.
■
The corkscrew shape of the helix in Example 4 is familiar from its occurrence in
coiled springs. It also occurs in the model of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic
material of living cells). In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the
structure of the DNA molecule is that of two linked, parallel helixes that are inter-
twined as in Figure 3.
In Examples 3 and 4 we were given vector equations of curves and asked for a geo-
metric description or sketch. In the next two examples we are given a geometric descrip-
tion of a curve and are asked to ﬁnd parametric equations for the curve.
EXAMPLE 5 Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line segment
that joins the point 
to the point 
.
SOLUTION In Section 10.5 we found a vector equation for the line segment that
joins the tip of the vector 
to the tip of the vector :
(See Equation 10.5.4.) Here we take 
and 
to obtain
a vector equation of the line segment from 
to

The projection of C onto the xy-plane is the circle 
. So we
know from Example 2 in Section 9.1 that we can write
From the equation of the plane, we have
So we can write parametric equations for C as
The corresponding vector equation is
This equation is called a parametrization of the curve C. The arrows in Figure 6
indicate the direction in which C is traced as the parameter t increases.
■
USING COMPUTERS TO DRAW SPACE CURVES
Space curves are inherently more difﬁcult to draw by hand than plane curves; for an
accurate representation we need to use technology. For instance, Figure 7 shows a
computer-generated graph of the curve with parametric equations
It’s called a toroidal spiral because it lies on a torus. Another interesting curve, the
trefoil knot, with equations
is graphed in Figure 8. It wouldn’t be easy to plot either of these curves by hand.
Even when a computer is used to draw a space curve, optical illusions make it dif-
ﬁcult to get a good impression of what the curve really looks like. (This is especially
true in Figure 8.) The next example shows how to cope with this problem.

EXAMPLE 7 Use a computer to draw the curve with vector equation
This curve is called a twisted cubic.
SOLUTION We start by using the computer to plot the curve with parametric equa-
tions 
, 
, 
for 
. The result is shown in Figure 9(a), but
it’s hard to see the true nature of the curve from that graph alone. Most three-
dimensional computer graphing programs allow the user to enclose a curve or sur-
face in a box instead of displaying the coordinate axes. When we look at the same
curve in a box in Figure 9(b), we have a much clearer picture of the curve. We can
see that it climbs from a lower corner of the box to the upper corner nearest us, and
it twists as it climbs. We get an even better idea of the curve when we view it from
different vantage points. Part (c) shows the result of rotating the box to give another
viewpoint.

DERIVATIVES

of a vector function is deﬁned in much the same way as for real-
valued functions:
if this limit exists. The geometric signiﬁcance of this deﬁnition is shown in Figure 10.
If the points

vector

The parameter value corresponding to the point 
is

Thus

Geometrically, this result says that if a curve lies on a sphere with center the origin,
then the tangent vector 
is always perpendicular to the position vector 
.

INTEGRALS
The deﬁnite integral of a continuous vector function 
can be deﬁned in much the
same way as for real-valued functions except that the integral is a vector. But then we
can express the integral of in terms of the integrals of its component functions , ,
and 
as follows. (We use the notation of Chapter 4.)
and so
This means that we can evaluate an integral of a vector function by integrating each
component function.
We can extend the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to continuous vector func-
tions as follows:
where 
is an antiderivative of , that is, 
. We use the notation 
for
indeﬁnite integrals (antiderivatives).

equivalently, the parametric equations

it can be shown that its length is

A single curve 
can be represented by more than one vector function. For in-
stance, the twisted cubic
could also be represented by the function
where the connection between the parameters and 
is given by 
. We say that
Equations 4 and 5 are parametrizations of the curve . If we were to use Equation 3
to compute the length of 
using Equations 4 and 5, we would get the same answer.

In general, it can be shown that when Equation 3 is used to compute arc length, the
answer is independent of the parametrization that is used.
Now we suppose that 
is a curve given by a vector function
where 
is continuous and 
is traversed exactly once as increases from 
to . We
deﬁne its arc length function
by
Thus 
is the length of the part of 
between 
and 
. (See Figure 3.) If we 
differentiate both sides of Equation 6 using Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Cal -
cu lus, we obtain
It is often useful to parametrize a curve with respect to arc length because arc
length arises naturally from the shape of the curve and does not depend on a particu-
lar coordinate system. If a curve 
is already given in terms of a parameter and
is the arc length function given by Equation 6, then we may be able to solve for as a
function of :
Then the curve can be reparametrized in terms of by substi-
tuting for : 
. Thus if 
for instance, 
is the position vector of the
point 3 units of length along the curve from its starting point.
EXAMPLE 2 Reparametrize the helix 
with respect to
arc length measured from 
in the direction of increasing .
SOLUTION The initial point 
corresponds to the parameter value 
.
From Example 1 we have
and so
Therefore 
and the required reparametrization is obtained by substituting
for :
■
CURVATURE
A parametrization 
is called smooth on an interval if 
is continuous and
on . A curve is called smooth if it has a smooth parametrization. A smooth curve has
no sharp corners or cusps; when the tangent vector turns, it does so continuously.
If 
is a smooth curve deﬁned by the vector function , recall that the unit tangent
vector 
is given by

and indicates the direction of the curve. From Figure 4 you can see that 
changes
direction very slowly when 
is fairly straight, but it changes direction more quickly
when 
bends or twists more sharply.
The curvature of 
at a given point is a measure of how quickly the curve changes
direction at that point. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne it to be the magnitude of the rate of
change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length. (We use arc length so that
the curvature will be independent of the parametrization.)
DEFINITION The curvature of a curve is
where 
is the unit tangent vector.
The curvature is easier to compute if it is expressed in terms of the parameter
instead of , so we use the Chain Rule (Theorem 10.7.5, Formula 6) to write
But 
from Equation 7, so
EXAMPLE 3 Show that the curvature of a circle of radius 
is 
.
SOLUTION We can take the circle to have center the origin, and then a parame-
trization is
Therefore
so
and
This gives 
, so using Equation 9, we have
■
The result of Example 3 shows that small circles have large curvature and large cir-
cles have small curvature, in accordance with our intuition. We can see directly from
the deﬁnition of curvature that the curvature of a straight line is always 0 because the
tangent vector is constant.
Although Formula 9 can be used in all cases to compute the curvature, the formula
given by the following theorem is often more convenient to apply.

for all , we have 
by Example 11 in Section 10.7, so
is orthogonal to

is itself not a unit vector. But at any point where
we can deﬁne the principal unit normal vector
(or simply unit normal)
as
The vector 
is called the binormal vector. It is perpendicular to
both 
and 
and is also a unit vector. (See Figure 6.)

The plane determined by the normal and binormal vectors

is called the normal plane of 
at . It consists of all lines that are orthog-
onal to the tangent vector . The plane determined by the vectors 
and 
is called
the osculating plane of 
at . The name comes from the Latin osculum, meaning
“kiss.” It is the plane that comes closest to containing the part of the curve near . (For
a plane curve, the osculating plane is simply the plane that contains the curve.)
The circle that lies in the osculating plane of 
at , has the same tangent as 
at
, lies on the concave side of

points), and has radius 
(the
reciprocal of the curvature) is called the osculating circle (or the circle of curvature)
of 
at . It is the circle that best describes how 
behaves near ; it shares the same
tangent, normal, and curvature at . (See Figure 8.)

MOTION IN SPACE: VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION
In this section we show how the ideas of tangent and normal vectors and curvature can
be used in physics to study the motion of an object, including its velocity and accel-
eration, along a space curve. In particular, we follow in the footsteps of Newton by
using these methods to derive Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion.
Suppose a particle moves through space so that its position vector at time is 
.
Notice from Figure 1 that, for small values of , the vector
approximates the direction of the particle moving along the curve 
. Its magnitude
measures the size of the displacement vector per unit time. The vector 
gives the
average velocity over a time interval of length and its limit is the velocity vector
at time :
Thus the velocity vector is also the tangent vector and points in the direction of the tan-
gent line.
The speed of the particle at time
is the magnitude of the velocity vector, that is,
. This is appropriate because, from 
and from Equation 10.8.7, we have
As in the case of one-dimensional motion, the acceleration of the particle is deﬁned
as the derivative of the velocity:

Putting

■
In general, vector integrals allow us to recover velocity when acceleration is known
and position when velocity is known:
If the force that acts on a particle is known, then the acceleration can be found from
Newton’s Second Law of Motion. The vector version of this law states that if, at any
time , a force 
acts on an object of mass 
producing an acceleration 
, then
EXAMPLE 4 An object with mass 
that moves in a circular path with constant
angular speed 
has position vector 
. Find the force
acting on the object and show that it is directed toward the origin.
SOLUTION
Therefore Newton’s Second Law gives the force as
Notice that 
. This shows that the force acts in the direction oppo-
site to the radius vector 
and therefore points toward the origin (see Figure 5).
Such a force is called a centripetal (center-seeking) force.
■
EXAMPLE 5 A projectile is ﬁred with angle of elevation 
and initial velocity 
.
(See Figure 6.) Assuming that air resistance is negligible and the only external force
is due to gravity, ﬁnd the position function 
of the projectile. What value of
maximizes the range (the horizontal distance traveled)?
SOLUTION We set up the axes so that the projectile starts at the origin. Since the
force due to gravity acts downward, we have

TANGENTIAL AND NORMAL COMPONENTS OF ACCELERATION
When we study the motion of a particle, it is often useful to resolve the acceleration
into two components, one in the direction of the tangent and the other in the direction
of the normal. If we write 
for the speed of the particle, then
and so
If we differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to , we get
If we use the expression for the curvature given by Equation 10.8.9, then we have
The unit normal vector was deﬁned in the preceding section as 
, so
gives
and Equation 5 becomes
Writing 
and 
for the tangential and normal components of acceleration, we have
where
This resolution is illustrated in Figure 7.
Let’s look at what Formula 7 says. The ﬁrst thing to notice is that the binormal vec-
tor B is absent. No matter how an object moves through space, its acceleration always
lies in the plane of T and N (the osculating plane). (Recall that T gives the direction
of motion and N points in the direction the curve is turning.) Next we notice that the

tangential component of acceleration is , the rate of change of speed, and the normal
component of acceleration is 
, the curvature times the square of the speed. This
makes sense if we think of a passenger in a car—a sharp turn in a road means a large
value of the curvature , so the component of the acceleration perpendicular to the
motion is large and the passenger is thrown against a car door. High speed around the
turn has the same effect; in fact, if you double your speed, 
is increased by a factor
of 4.
Although we have expressions for the tangential and normal components of accel-
eration in Equations 8, it’s desirable to have expressions that depend only on , , and
. To this end we take the dot product of

Therefore

KEPLER’S LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION
We now describe one of the great accomplishments of calculus by showing how the
material of this chapter can be used to prove Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. After
20 years of studying the astronomical observations of the Danish astronomer Tycho
Brahe, the German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) for-
mulated the following three laws.
KEPLER’S LAWS
1. A planet revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit with the sun at one
focus.
2. The line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the
cube of the length of the major axis of its orbit.
In his book Principia Mathematica of 1687, Sir Isaac Newton was able to show
that these three laws are consequences of two of his own laws, the Second Law of
Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. In what follows we prove Kepler’s First
Law. The remaining laws are proved as a Web Project (with hints).
Since the gravitational force of the sun on a planet is so much larger than the forces
exerted by other celestial bodies, we can safely ignore all bodies in the universe except
the sun and one planet revolving about it. We use a coordinate system with the sun at
the origin and we let 
be the position vector of the planet. (Equally well,
could be the position vector of the moon or a satellite moving around the earth or a
comet moving around a star.) The velocity vector is 
and the acceleration vec-
tor is 
. We use the following laws of Newton:
where 
is the gravitational force on the planet, 
and 
are the masses of the plan-
et and the sun, 
is the gravitational constant, 
, and 
is the unit vec-
tor in the direction of .
We ﬁrst show that the planet moves in one plane. By equating the expressions for
in Newton’s two laws, we ﬁnd that
and so 
is parallel to . It follows that 
. We use Formula 5 in Theorem
10.7.5 to write

where 
is a constant vector. (We may assume that 
; that is, and are not par-
allel.) This means that the vector 
is perpendicular to 
for all values of t, so
the planet always lies in the plane through the origin perpendicular to . Thus the orbit
of the planet is a plane curve.
To prove Kepler’s First Law we rewrite the vector 
as follows:
Then
(by Theorem 10.4.8, Property 6)
But 
and, since 
, it follows from Example 11 in Sec-
tion 10.7 that 
. Therefore
and so
Integrating both sides of this equation, we get
where is a constant vector.
At this point it is convenient to choose the coordinate axes so that the standard basis
vector points in the direction of the vector . Then the planet moves in the 
-plane.
Since both 
and 
are perpendicular to , Equation 11 shows that 
lies in the 
-plane. This means that we can choose the - and -axes so that the vector lies in
the direction of , as shown in Figure 8.
If 
is the angle between 
and , then 
are polar coordinates of the planet.
From Equation 11 we have
where

Writing

Comparing with Theorem 9.5.8, we see that Equation 12 is the polar equation of a
conic section with focus at the origin and eccentricity . We know that the orbit of a
planet is a closed curve and so the conic must be an ellipse.
This completes the derivation of Kepler’s First Law. A Web Project will guide you
through the derivation of the Second and Third Laws. The proofs of these three laws
show that the methods of this chapter provide a powerful tool for describing some of
the laws of nature.

11.1
FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
The temperature 
at a point on the surface of the earth at any given time depends on
the longitude 
and latitude 
of the point. We can think of 
as being a function of
the two variables and , or as a function of the pair 
. We indicate this functional
dependence by writing 
.
The volume 
of a circular cylinder depends on its radius 
and its height . In 
fact, we know that
. We say that
is a function of
and
, and we write
.
DEFINITION A function
of two variables is a rule that assigns to each
ordered pair of real numbers 
in a set 
a unique real number denoted by
. The set 
is the domain of 
and its range is the set of values that
takes on, that is, 
.
We often write 
to make explicit the value taken on by 
at the general
point 
. The variables and are independent variables and is the dependent
variable. [Compare this with the notation 
for functions of a single variable.]
A function of two variables is just a function whose domain is a subset of 
and
whose range is a subset of . One way of visualizing such a function is by means of
an arrow diagram (see Figure 1), where the domain 
is represented as a subset of the
-plane and the range is a set of numbers on a real line, shown as a -axis. For
instance, if 
represents the temperature at a point 
in a ﬂat metal plate with
the shape of , we can think of the -axis as a thermometer displaying the recorded
temperatures.
If a function 
is given by a formula and no domain is speciﬁed, then the domain
of 
is understood to be the set of all pairs 
for which the given expression is a
well-deﬁned real number.

PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
So far we have dealt with the calculus of functions of a single variable. But, in the real world, physical
quantities often depend on two or more variables, so in this chapter we turn our attention to functions
of several variables and extend the basic ideas of differential calculus to such functions.

Another way of visualizing the behavior of a function of two variables is to consider
its graph.

graph of

Just as the graph of a function

. We can visualize the graph 
of 
as lying directly above or below its
domain 
in the 
-plane (see Figure 5).
EXAMPLE 3 Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION The graph of 
has the equation 
, or 
,
which represents a plane. To graph the plane we ﬁrst ﬁnd the intercepts. Putting
in the equation, we get 
as the -intercept. Similarly, the -intercept
is 3 and the -intercept is 6. This helps us sketch the portion of the graph that lies in
the ﬁrst octant (Figure 6).
■
The function in Example 3 is a special case of the function
which is called a linear function. The graph of such a function has the equation
, or 
, so it is a plane. In much the same way
that linear functions of one variable are important in single-variable calculus, we will
see that linear functions of two variables play a central role in multivariable calculus.
EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the graph of 
.
SOLUTION The graph has equation 
. We square both sides of
this equation to obtain 
, or 
, which we recognize
as an equation of the sphere with center the origin and radius 3. But, since 
,
the graph of is just the top half of this sphere (see Figure 7).
■
EXAMPLE 5 Find the domain and range and sketch the graph of
SOLUTION Notice that 
is deﬁned for all possible ordered pairs of real num-
bers 
, so the domain is 
, the entire xy-plane. The range of h is the set
of all nonnegative real numbers. [Notice that 
and 
, so 
for
all x and y.]
The graph of h has the equation 
, which is the elliptic paraboloid
that we sketched in Example 4 in Section 10.6. Horizontal traces are ellipses and
vertical traces are parabolas (see Figure 8).
■
Computer programs are readily available for graphing functions of two variables.
In most such programs, traces in the vertical planes 
and 
are drawn for
equally spaced values of 
and parts of the graph are eliminated using hidden line
removal.

Fig ure 9 shows computer-generated graphs of several functions. Notice that we get
an especially good picture of a function when rotation is used to give views from dif-
ferent vantage points. In parts (a) and (b) the graph of 
is very ﬂat and close to the
-plane except near the origin; this is because 
is very small when or is large.
LEVEL CURVES
So far we have two methods for visualizing functions: arrow diagrams and graphs. A
third method, borrowed from mapmakers, is a contour map on which points of con-
stant elevation are joined to form contour curves, or level curves.
DEFINITION The level curves of a function 
of two variables are the curves
with equations 
, where is a constant (in the range of ).
A level curve 
is the set of all points in the domain of at which takes
on a given value . In other words, it shows where the graph of 
has height .
You can see from Figure 10 the relation between level curves and horizontal traces.
The level curves 
are just the traces of the graph of in the horizontal plane
projected down to the 
-plane. So if you draw the level curves of a function

and visualize them being lifted up to the surface at the indicated height, then you can
mentally piece together a picture of the graph. The surface is steep where the level
curves are close together. It is somewhat ﬂatter where they are farther apart.
One common example of level curves occurs in topographic maps of mountainous
regions, such as the map in Figure 11. The level curves are curves of constant eleva-
tion above sea level. If you walk along one of these contour lines you neither ascend nor
descend. Another common example is the temperature function introduced in the
opening paragraph of this section. Here the level curves are called isothermals and
join locations with the same temperature. Figure 12 shows a weather map of the world
indicating the average January temperatures. The isothermals are the curves that sep-
arate the shaded bands.

FUNCTIONS OF THREE OR MORE VARIABLES
A function of three variables, , is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple
in a domain 
a unique real number denoted by 
. For instance, the tem-
perature 
at a point on the surface of the earth depends on the longitude x and lati-
tude y of the point and on the time t, so we could write 
.
EXAMPLE 10 Find the domain of 
if 
.
SOLUTION The expression for 
is deﬁned as long as 
, so the
domain of 
is
This is a half-space consisting of all points that lie above the plane 
.
■
It’s very difﬁcult to visualize a function 
of three variables by its graph, since that
would lie in a four-dimensional space. However, we do gain some insight into 
by
examining its level surfaces, which are the surfaces with equations 
,
where 
is a constant. If the point 
moves along a level surface, the value of
remains ﬁxed.
EXAMPLE 11 Find the level surfaces of the function 
.
SOLUTION The level surfaces are 
, where 
. These form a
family of concentric spheres with radius 
. (See Figure 18.) Thus as 
varies
over any sphere with center , the value of 
remains ﬁxed.
■
Functions of any number of variables can be considered. A function of n vari ables
is a rule that assigns a number 
to an -tuple 
of
real numbers. We denote by 
the set of all such n-tuples. For example, if a company
uses different ingredients in making a food product, 
is the cost per unit of the
ingredient, and 
units of the 
ingredient are used, then the total cost 
of the ingre-
dients is a function of the 
variables 
:
The function 
is a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of 
. Some -
times we will use vector notation in order to write such functions more compactly: If
, we often write 
in place of 
. With this nota-
tion we can rewrite the function deﬁned in Equation 1 as
where 
and 
denotes the dot product of the vectors c and x
in 
.
In view of the one-to-one correspondence between points 
in 
and
their position vectors 
in 
, we have three ways of looking at a
function f deﬁned on a subset of 
:
1. As a function of 
real variables 
2. As a function of a single point variable 
3. As a function of a single vector variable 
We will see that all three points of view are useful.

11.2
LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
The limit of a function of two or more variables is similar to the limit of a function of
a single variable. We use the notation
to indicate that the values of 
approach the number L as the point 
approaches the point 
along any path that stays within the domain of . In other
words, we can make the values of 
as close to L as we like by taking the point
sufﬁciently close to the point 
, but not equal to 
. A more precise deﬁ-
nition follows.
DEFINITION Let 
be a function of two variables whose domain D
includes points arbitrarily close to 
. Then we say that the limit of
as 
approaches 
is 
and we write
if for every number 
there is a corresponding number 
such that
and
then
Other notations for the limit in Deﬁnition 1 are
and    
Notice that 
is the distance between the numbers 
and , and
is the distance between the point 
and the point 
.
Thus Deﬁnition 1 says that the distance between 
and 
can be made arbitrar-
ily small by making the distance from 
to 
sufﬁciently small (but not 0).
Figure 1 illustrates Deﬁnition 1 by means of an arrow diagram. If any small interval
is given around , then we can ﬁnd a disk 
with center 
and
radius 
such that 
maps all the points in 
[except possibly 
] into the
interval 
.

Another illustration of Deﬁnition 1 is given in Figure 2 where the surface 
is the
graph of . If 
is given, we can ﬁnd 
such that if 
is restricted to lie
in the disk 
and 
, then the corresponding part of 
lies between the
horizontal planes 
and 
.
For functions of a single variable, when we let 
approach , there are only two
possible directions of approach, from the left or from the right. We recall from Chap -
ter 1 that if 
, then 
does not exist.
For functions of two variables the situation is not as simple because we can let
approach 
from an inﬁnite number of directions in any manner whatsoever
(see Figure 3) as long as 
stays within the domain of .
Deﬁnition 1 says that the distance between 
and L can be made arbitrarily
small by making the distance from 
to 
sufﬁciently small (but not 0). The
deﬁnition refers only to the distance between 
and 
. It does not refer to the
direction of approach. Therefore, if the limit exists, then 
must approach the
same limit no matter how 
approaches 
. Thus if we can ﬁnd two different
paths of approach along which the function 
has different limits, then it follows
that 
does not exist.
If

Although we have obtained identical limits along the axes, that does not show that
the given limit is 0. Let’s now approach 
along another line, say 
. For all
,
Therefore
(See Figure 5.) Since we have obtained different limits along different paths, the
given limit does not exist.

Figure 6 sheds some light on Example 2. The ridge that occurs above the line
corresponds to the fact that

on that line except the 
origin.
EXAMPLE 3 If

SOLUTION With the solution of Example 2 in mind, let’s try to save time by letting
along any nonvertical line through the origin. Then 
, where 
is the slope, and
So
Thus 
has the same limiting value along every nonvertical line through the origin.
But that does not show that the given limit is 0, for if we now let
along the parabola 
, we have
so
Since different paths lead to different limiting values, the given limit does not exist.
■
Now let’s look at limits that do exist. Just as for functions of one variable, the cal-
culation of limits for functions of two variables can be greatly simpliﬁed by the use of
properties of limits. The Limit Laws listed in Section 1.4 can be extended to functions
of two variables: The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, the limit of a product is
the product of the limits, and so on. In particular, the following equations are true.
The Squeeze Theorem also holds.

if it exists.
SOLUTION As in Example 3, we could show that the limit along any line through
the origin is 0. This doesn’t prove that the given limit is 0, but the limits along the

CONTINUITY
Recall that evaluating limits of continuous functions of a single variable is easy. It can
be accomplished by direct substitution because the deﬁning property of a continuous
function is 
. Continuous functions of two variables are also deﬁned
by the direct substitution property.
DEFINITION A function 
of two variables is called continuous at
if
We say 
is continuous on 
if 
is continuous at every point 
in .
The intuitive meaning of continuity is that if the point 
changes by a small
amount, then the value of 
changes by a small amount. This means that a sur-
face that is the graph of a continuous function has no hole or break.
Using the properties of limits, you can see that sums, differences, products, and
quotients of continuous functions are continuous on their domains. Let’s use this fact
to give examples of continuous functions.
A polynomial function of two variables (or polynomial, for short) is a sum of
terms of the form 
, where is a constant and 
and 
are nonnegative integers.
A rational function is a ratio of polynomials. For instance,

is a polynomial, whereas
is a rational function.
The limits in 
show that the functions 
, 
, and
are continuous. Since any polynomial can be built up out of the simple functions , 
, and by multiplication and addition, it follows that all polynomials are continuous
on 
. Likewise, any rational function is continuous on its domain because it is a quo-
tient of continuous functions.

SOLUTION Since 
is a polynomial, it is continu-
ous everywhere, so we can ﬁnd the limit by direct substitution:

EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function 
continuous?
SOLUTION The function 
is discontinuous at 
because it is not deﬁned there. 
Since

EXAMPLE 7 Let

Just as for functions of one variable, composition is another way of combining 
two continuous functions to get a third. In fact, it can be shown that if
is a contin-
uous function of two variables and 
is a continuous function of a single variable 
that is deﬁned on the range of , then the composite function 
deﬁned by
is also a continuous function.

EXAMPLE 9 Where is the function

SOLUTION The function

ous except on the line

So the composite function

FUNCTIONS OF THREE OR MORE VARIABLES
Everything that we have done in this section can be extended to functions of three or
more variables. The notation
means that the values of 
approach the number L as the point
approaches the point 
along any path in the domain of f. Because the distance
between two points 
and 
is 
, we
can write the precise deﬁnition as follows: For every number 
there is a corre-
sponding number 
such that
if
and
then  
The function f is continuous at 
if
For instance, the function
is a rational function of three variables and so is continuous at every point in 
except
where 
. In other words, it is discontinuous on the sphere with cen-
ter the origin and radius 1.
If we use the vector notation introduced at the end of Section 11.1, then we can
write the deﬁnitions of a limit for functions of two or three variables in a single com-
pact form as follows.
If is deﬁned on a subset D of 
, then 
means that for
every number 
there is a corresponding number 
such that

PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
If 
is a function of two variables 
and , suppose we let only 
vary while keeping
ﬁxed, say 
, where is a constant. Then we are really considering a function of
a single variable , namely, 
. If has a derivative at , then we call it the
partial derivative of
with respect to x at 
and denote it by 
. Thus
By the deﬁnition of a derivative, we have
and so Equation 1 becomes
Similarly, the partial derivative of 
with respect to y at 
, denoted by 
,
is obtained by keeping ﬁxed 
and ﬁnding the ordinary derivative at 
of the
function 
:
If we now let the point 
vary in Equations 2 and 3, 
and 
become functions
of two variables.
If 
is a function of two variables, its partial derivatives are the functions
and 
deﬁned by
There are many alternative notations for partial derivatives. For instance, instead of 
we can write 
or 
(to indicate differentiation with respect to the ﬁrst variable)
or 
. But here 
can’t be interpreted as a ratio of differentials.

To compute partial derivatives, all we have to do is remember from Equation 1 that 
the partial derivative with respect to is just the ordinary derivative of the function
of a single variable that we get by keeping 
ﬁxed. Thus we have the following rule.

INTERPRETATIONS OF PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
To give a geometric interpretation of partial derivatives, we recall that the equation
represents a surface 
(the graph of 
). If 
, then the point
lies on . By ﬁxing 
, we are restricting our attention to the curve 
in
which the vertical plane 
intersects S. (In other words, 
is the trace of in the
plane 
.) Likewise, the vertical plane 
intersects in a curve 
. Both of the
curves 
and 
pass through the point . (See Figure 1.)
Notice that the curve 
is the graph of the function 
, so the slope 
of its tangent
at
is
. The curve
is the graph of the function
, so the slope of its tangent 
at 
is 
.
Thus the partial derivatives 
and 
can be interpreted geometrically as
the slopes of the tangent lines at 
to the traces 
and 
of 
in the planes
and 
.
Partial derivatives can also be interpreted as rates of change. If 
, then
represents the rate of change of with respect to 
when 
is ﬁxed. Similarly,
represents the rate of change of with respect to when is ﬁxed.

FUNCTIONS OF MORE THAN TWO VARIABLES
Partial derivatives can also be deﬁned for functions of three or more variables. For
example, if 
is a function of three variables , , and , then its partial derivative with
respect to is deﬁned as
and it is found by regarding 
and 
as constants and differentiating 
with
respect to . If 
, then 
can be interpreted as the rate of change
of 
with respect to x when y and are held ﬁxed. But we can’t interpret it geometri-
cally because the graph of f lies in four-dimensional space.
In general, if is a function of variables,

■Alexis Clairaut was a child prodigy in 
mathematics, having read l’Hospital’s text-
book on calculus when he was ten and pre-
sented a paper on geometry to the French
Academy of Sciences when he was 13. 
At the age of 18, Clairaut published
Recherches sur les courbes à double cour-

is called Laplace’s equation after Pierre Laplace (1749–1827). Solutions of this equa -
 tion are called harmonic functions and play a role in problems of heat conduction,
ﬂuid ﬂow, and electric potential.
EXAMPLE 8 Show that the function 
is a solution of Laplace’s 
equation.
SOLUTION
Therefore 
satisﬁes Laplace’s equation.
■
The wave equation
describes the motion of a waveform, which could be an ocean wave, a sound wave, a
light wave, or a wave traveling along a vibrating string. For instance, if 
repre-
sents the displacement of a vibrating violin string at time and at a distance 
from
one end of the string (as in Figure 5), then 
satisﬁes the wave equation. Here the
constant 
depends on the density of the string and on the tension in the string.
EXAMPLE 9 Verify that the function 
satisﬁes the wave 
equation.
SOLUTION
So 
satisﬁes the wave equation.

SECTION 11.4  TANGENT PLANES AND LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS

11.4
TANGENT PLANES AND LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS
One of the most important ideas in single-variable calculus is that as we zoom in
toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function, the graph becomes indistin-
guishable from its tangent line and we can approximate the function by a linear func-
tion. (See Sec tion 2.8.) Here we develop similar ideas in three dimensions. As we
zoom in toward a point on a surface that is the graph of a differentiable func tion of
two variables, the surface looks more and more like a plane (its tangent plane) and we
can approximate the function by a linear function of two variables. We also extend the
idea of a differential to functions of two or more variables.
TANGENT PLANES
Suppose a surface 
has equation 
, where 
has continuous ﬁrst partial
derivatives, and let 
be a point on . As in the preceding section, let 
and
be the curves obtained by intersecting the vertical planes 
and 
with
the surface . Then the point 
lies on both 
and 
. Let 
and 
be the tangent
lines to the curves 
and 
at the point . Then the tangent plane to the surface
at the point 
is deﬁned to be the plane that contains both tangent lines 
and 
. (See
Figure 1.)
We will see in Section 11.6 that if 
is any other curve that lies on the surface
and passes through , then its tangent line at 
also lies in the tangent plane. There-
fore you can think of the tangent plane to 
at 
as consisting of all possible tangent
lines at 
to curves that lie on and pass through . The tangent plane at 
is the plane
that most closely approximates the surface 
near the point .
We know from Equation 10.5.7 that any plane passing through the point
has an equation of the form
By dividing this equation by 
and letting 
and 
, we can write
it in the form

If Equation 1 represents the tangent plane at , then its intersection with the plane
must be the tangent line 
. Setting 
in Equation 1 gives
and we recognize these as the equations (in point-slope form) of a line with slope . 
But from Section 11.3 we know that the slope of the tangent 
is 
. Therefore
.
Similarly, putting 
in Equation 1, we get 
, which must rep-
resent the tangent line 
, so 
.
Suppose

plane to the surface 
at the point

Figure 2(a) shows the elliptic paraboloid and its tangent plane at (1, 1, 3) that we
found in Example 1. In parts (b) and (c) we zoom in toward the point (1, 1, 3) by
restricting the domain of the function 
. Notice that the more we
zoom in, the ﬂatter the graph appears and the more it resembles its tangent plane.

In Figure 3 we corroborate this impression by zooming in toward the point (1, 1)
on a contour map of the function 
. Notice that the more we zoom
in, the more the level curves look like equally spaced parallel lines, which is charac-
teristic of a plane.
LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS
In Example 1 we found that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of the func-
tion 
at the point (1, 1, 3) is 
. Therefore, in view
of the visual evidence in Figures 2 and 3, the linear function of two variables
is a good approximation to 
when 
is near (1, 1). The function L is called
the linearization of f at (1, 1) and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or tangent plane approximation of f at (1, 1).
For instance, at the point (1.1, 0.95) the linear approximation gives
which is quite close to the true value of 
. 
But if we take a point farther away from (1, 1), such as (2, 3), we no longer get a good
approximation. In fact, 
whereas 
.
In general, we know from 
that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of
a function f of two variables at the point 
is
if and are continuous. The linear function whose graph is this tangent plane, namely
is called the linearization of f at 
and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or the tangent plane approximation of at

We have deﬁned tangent planes for surfaces 
, where 
has continuous
ﬁrst partial derivatives. What happens if 
and 
are not continuous? Figure 4 pic-
tures such a function; its equation is
You can verify (see Exercise 38) that its partial derivatives exist at the origin and, in
fact, 
and 
, but 
and 
are not continuous. The linear approx-
imation would be 
, but 
at all points on the line 
(other
than the origin). So a function of two variables can behave badly even though both of
its partial derivatives exist. To rule out such behavior, we formulate the idea of a dif-
ferentiable function of two variables.
Recall that for a function of one variable, 
, if x changes from a to
we deﬁned the increment of as
In Chapter 2 we showed that if 
is differentiable at a, then
Now consider a function of two variables, 
, and suppose x changes from
a to 
and y changes from b to 
. Then the corresponding increment of
is
Thus the increment 
represents the change in the value of 
when 
changes
from 
to 
. By analogy with 
we deﬁne the differentiability
of a function of two variables as follows.
DEFINITION If 
, then 
is differentiable at 
if 
can be
expressed in the form
where 
and 
as 
.
Deﬁnition 7 says that a differentiable function is one for which the linear approxi-
mation 
is a good approximation when 
is near 
. In other words, the tan-
gent plane approximates the graph of f well near the point of tangency.
It’s sometimes hard to use Deﬁnition 7 directly to check the differentiability of 
a function, but the following theorem provides a convenient sufﬁcient condition for
differentiability.
THEOREM If the partial derivatives 
and 
exist near 
and are con-
tinuous at 
, then 
is differentiable at

DIFFERENTIALS
For a differentiable function of one variable, 
, we deﬁne the differential dx to
be an independent variable; that is, dx can be given the value of any real number. The
differential of is then deﬁned as
(See Section 2.8.) Figure 6 shows the relationship between the increment 
and the
differential 
: 
represents the change in height of the curve 
and 
rep-
resents the change in height of the tangent line when changes by an amount 
For a differentiable function of two variables, 
, we deﬁne the differen-
tials
and 
to be independent variables; that is, they can be given any values. Then
the differential
, also called the total differential, is deﬁned by
(Compare with Equation 9.) Sometimes the notation 
is used in place of 
.
If we take 
and 
in Equation 10, then the dif-
ferential of is

SOLUTION The volume 
of a cone with base radius and height is 
.
So the differential of 
is
Since each error is at most 
cm, we have 
, 
. To estimate the
largest error in the volume we take the largest error in the measurement of and of
. Therefore we take 
and 
along with 
, 
. This gives
Thus the maximum error in the calculated volume is about 
cm

FUNCTIONS OF THREE OR MORE VARIABLES
Linear approximations, differentiability, and differentials can be deﬁned in a similar
manner for functions of more than two variables. A differentiable function is deﬁned
by an expression similar to the one in Deﬁnition 7. For such functions the linear
approximation is
and the linearization 
is the right side of this expression.
If 
, then the increment of 
is
The differential
is deﬁned in terms of the differentials 
, 
, and 
of the inde-
pendent variables by
EXAMPLE 5 The dimensions of a rectangular box are measured to be 75 cm, 60 cm, 
and 40 cm, and each measurement is correct to within 
cm. Use differentials to
estimate the largest possible error when the volume of the box is calculated from
these measurements.
SOLUTION If the dimensions of the box are , , and , its volume is 
and
so
We are given that 
, 
, and 
. To estimate the largest
error in the volume, we therefore use 
, 
, and 
together
with 
, 
, and 
:
Thus an error of only 
cm in measuring each dimension could lead to an error of
approximately 1980 cm in the calculated volume! This may seem like a large error,
but it’s only about 1% of the volume of the box.

11.5
THE CHAIN RULE
Recall that the Chain Rule for functions of a single variable gives the rule for differ-
entiating a composite function: If 
and 
, where 
and are differen-
tiable functions, then is indirectly a differentiable function of and
For functions of more than one variable, the Chain Rule has several versions, each
of them giving a rule for differentiating a composite function. The ﬁrst version (The-
orem 2) deals with the case where 
and each of the variables and is, in
turn, a function of a variable . This means that 
is indirectly a function of ,
, and the Chain Rule gives a formula for differentiating as a function
of . We assume that 
is differentiable (Deﬁnition 11.4.7). Recall that this is the case
when 
and 
are continuous (Theorem 11.4.8).
THE CHAIN RULE (CASE 1) Suppose that 
is a differentiable
function of and , where 
and 
are both differentiable func-
tions of . Then is a differentiable function of and

The derivative in Example 1 can be interpreted as the rate of change of 
with
respect to 
as the point 
moves along the curve 
with parametric equations
, 
. (See Figure 1.) In particular, when 
, the point 
is
and 
is the rate of increase as we move along the curve 
through
. If, for instance, 
represents the temperature at the
point 
, then the composite function 
represents the tempera-
ture at points on 
and the derivative 
represents the rate at which the temper -
ature changes along .
EXAMPLE 2 The pressure 
(in kilopascals), volume 
(in liters), and tempera-
ture 
(in kelvins) of a mole of an ideal gas are related by the equation 
. 
Find the rate at which the pressure is changing when the temperature is 
and
increas ing at a rate of 
and the volume is 100 L and increasing at a rate of
.
SOLUTION If represents the time elapsed in seconds, then at the given instant we
have 
, 
, 
, 
. Since
the Chain Rule gives
The pressure is decreasing at a rate of about 
kPas.

We now consider the situation where 
but each of 
and 
is a function
of two variables and : 
, 
. Then is indirectly a function of and
and we wish to ﬁnd 
and 
. Recall that in computing 
we hold ﬁxed
and compute the ordinary derivative of 
with respect to . Therefore we can apply
Theorem 2 to obtain
A similar argument holds for 
and so we have proved the following version of
the Chain Rule.
THE CHAIN RULE (CASE 2) Suppose that

function of and , where

tions of s and t. Then

SOLUTION Applying Case 2 of the Chain Rule, we get
■
Case 2 of the Chain Rule contains three types of variables: 
and are indepen-
dent variables, and are called intermediate variables, and is the dependent vari-
able. Notice that Theorem 3 has one term for each intermediate variable and each of
these terms resembles the one-dimensional Chain Rule in Equation 1.
To remember the Chain Rule it’s helpful to draw the tree diagram in Figure 2. We
draw branches from the dependent variable to the intermediate variables 
and to
indicate that is a function of 
and . Then we draw branches from 
and 
to the
independent variables 
and . On each branch we write the corresponding partial
derivative. To ﬁnd 
we ﬁnd the product of the partial derivatives along each path
from to and then add these products:
Similarly, we ﬁnd 
by using the paths from to .
Now we consider the general situation in which a dependent variable 
is a func-
tion of 
intermediate variables 
, 
, each of which is, in turn, a function of
independent variables , 
. Notice that there are 
terms, one for each interme-
diate variable. The proof is similar to that of Case 1.
THE CHAIN RULE (GENERAL VERSION) Suppose that 
is a differentiable
function of the 
variables 
, 
, 
and each 
is a differentiable func-
tion of the 
variables , ,

SOLUTION We apply Theorem 4 with

diagram. Although we haven’t written the derivatives on the branches, it’s under-
stood that if a branch leads from to , then the partial derivative for that branch is

IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION
The Chain Rule can be used to give a more complete description of the process of
implicit differentiation that was introduced in Sections 2.6 and 11.3. We suppose that
an equation of the form 
deﬁnes implicitly as a differentiable function of
, that is, 
, where 
for all in the domain of . If 
is differen-
tiable, we can apply Case 1 of the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equa-
tion 
with respect to . Since both and are functions of , we obtain
But 
, so if 
we solve for 
and obtain
To derive this equation we assumed that 
deﬁnes implicitly as a func-
tion of . The Implicit Function Theorem, proved in advanced calculus, gives con-
ditions under which this assumption is valid. It states that if 
is deﬁned on a disk
containing 
where 
, 
, and 
and 
are continuous on
the disk, then the equation 
deﬁnes as a function of near the point
and the derivative of this function is given by Equation 6.

DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND 
THE GRADIENT VECTOR
Recall that if 
, then the partial derivatives 
and 
are deﬁned as
and represent the rates of change of in the - and -directions, that is, in the direc-
tions of the unit vectors and .
Suppose that we now wish to ﬁnd the rate of change of at 
in the direction
of an arbitrary unit vector 
. (See Figure 1.) To do this we consider the sur-
face 
with equation 
(the graph of ) and we let 
. Then the
point 
lies on . The vertical plane that passes through 
in the direction
of 
intersects 
in a curve . (See Figure 2.) The slope of the tangent line 
to 
at
the point 
is the rate of change of in the direction of .
If 
is another point on 
and 
, 
are the projections of , 
on the
-plane, then the vector P
B
Q is parallel to 
and so

for some scalar . Therefore 
, 
, so

, and
If we take the limit as 
, we obtain the rate of change of (with respect to dis-
tance) in the direction of , which is called the directional derivative of in the direc-
tion of .

DEFINITION The directional derivative of 
at 
in the direction of
a unit vector 
is
if this limit exists.
By comparing Deﬁnition 2 with Equations 1, we see that if 
, then
and if 
, then 
. In other words, the partial derivatives
of 
with respect to and are just special cases of the directional derivative.
When we compute the directional derivative of a function deﬁned by a formula, we
generally use the following theorem.
THEOREM If 
is a differentiable function of and , then 
has a direc-
tional derivative in the direction of any unit vector 
and
PROOF If we deﬁne a function of the single variable 
by
then by the deﬁnition of a derivative we have

THE GRADIENT VECTOR
Notice from Theorem 3 that the directional derivative can be written as the dot prod-
uct of two vectors:
The ﬁrst vector in this dot product occurs not only in computing directional deriv -
atives but in many other contexts as well. So we give it a special name (the gradient
of ) and a special notation (grad
or 
, which is read “del ”).

MAXIMIZING THE DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE
Suppose we have a function 
of two or three variables and we consider all possible
directional derivatives of 
at a given point. These give the rates of change of 
in all
possible directions. We can then ask the questions: In which of these directions does
change fastest and what is the maximum rate of change? The answers are provided
by the following theorem.
THEOREM Suppose 
is a differentiable function of two or three vari-
ables. The maximum value of the directional derivative 
is 
and
it occurs when 
has the same direction as the gradient vector 
.
PROOF From Equation 9 or 14 we have
where 
is the angle between 
and . The maximum value of 
is 1 and this
occurs when 
. Therefore the maximum value of 
is 
and it occurs
when 
, that is, when 
has the same direction as 
.
EXAMPLE 5
(a) If 
, ﬁnd the rate of change of 
at the point 
in the direction
from 
to 
.
(b) In what direction does 
have the maximum rate of change? What is this maxi-
mum rate of change?
SOLUTION
(a) We ﬁrst compute the gradient vector:
The unit vector in the direction of 
is 
, so the rate of
change of 
in the direction from 
to 
is
(b) According to Theorem 15, 
increases fastest in the direction of the gradient
vector 
. The maximum rate of change is

function 
of three variables, and let

the curve 
is described by a continuous vector function 
. Let

In particular, when

Equation 18 says that the gradient vector at , 
, is perpendicular to the 
tangent vector 
to any curve 
on 
that passes through . (See Figure 7.) If
, it is therefore natural to deﬁne the tangent plane to the level sur-
face
at
as the plane that passes through 
and has normal
vector 
. Using the standard equation of a plane (Equation 10.5.7), we can
write the equation of this tangent plane as
The normal line to 
at 
is the line passing through 
and perpendicular to the
tangent plane. The direction of the normal line is therefore given by the gradient vec-
tor 
and so, by Equation 10.5.3, its symmetric equations are
In the special case in which the equation of a surface 
is of the form
(that is, 
is the graph of a function 
of two variables), we can rewrite the equation
as
and regard 
as a level surface (with 
) of . Then
so Equation 19 becomes
which is equivalent to Equation 11.4.2. Thus our new, more general, deﬁnition of a tan-
gent plane is consistent with the deﬁnition that was given for the special case of Sec-
tion 11.4.

■
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GRADIENT VECTOR
We now summarize the ways in which the gradient vector is signiﬁcant. We ﬁrst con-
sider a function 
of three variables and a point 
in its domain. On the one
hand, we know from Theorem 15 that the gradient vector 
gives the direc-
tion of fastest increase of . On the other hand, we know that 
is orthog-
onal to the level surface 
of 
through . (Refer to Figure 7.) These two properties
are quite compatible intuitively because as we move away from 
on the level surface 
, the value of 
does not change at all. So it seems reasonable that if we move in the
perpendicular direction, we get the maximum increase.
In like manner we consider a function 
of two variables and a point 
in
its domain. Again the gradient vector 
gives the direction of fastest increase
of . Also, by considerations similar to our discussion of tangent planes, it can be
shown that 
is perpendicular to the level curve 
that passes
through . Again this is intuitively plausible because the values of 
remain constant
as we move along the curve. (See Figure 9.)
If we consider a topographical map of a hill and let 
represent the height
above sea level at a point with coordinates 
, then a curve of steepest ascent can
be drawn as in Figure 10 by making it perpendicular to all of the contour lines. This
phenomenon can also be noticed in Figure 11 in Section 11.1, where Lonesome Creek
follows a curve of steepest descent.

11.7
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES
As we saw in Chapter 3, one of the main uses of ordinary derivatives is in ﬁnding max-
imum and minimum values. In this section we see how to use partial derivatives to
locate maxima and minima of functions of two variables. In particular, in Example 5
we will see how to maximize the volume of a box without a lid if we have a ﬁxed
amount of cardboard to work with.
Look at the hills and valleys in the graph of 
shown in Figure 1. There are two
points 
where 
has a local maximum, that is, where 
is larger than nearby
values of 
. The larger of these two values is the absolute maximum. Likewise,
has two local minima, where 
is smaller than nearby values. The smaller of
these two values is the absolute minimum.
DEFINITION A function of two variables has a local maximum at
if
when 
is near 
. [This means that 
for all points 
in some disk with center 
.] The number 
is
called a local maximum value. If 
when 
is near 
,
then 
is a local minimum value.
If the inequalities in Deﬁnition 1 hold for all points 
in the domain of , then
has an absolute maximum (or absolute minimum) at 
.
THEOREM If 
has a local maximum or minimum at 
and the ﬁrst-
order partial derivatives of 
exist there, then 
and

PROOF Let 
. If 
has a local maximum (or minimum) at 
, then 
has a local maximum (or minimum) at , so 
by Fermat’s Theorem (see
Theorem 3.1.4). But 
(see Equation 11.3.1) and so 
.
Similarly, by applying Fermat’s Theorem to the function 
, we obtain
.
■
If we put 
and 
in the equation of a tangent plane (Equation
11.4.2), we get 
. Thus the geometric interpretation of Theorem 2 is that if the
graph of has a tangent plane at a local maximum or minimum, then the tangent plane
must be horizontal.
A point 
is called a critical point (or stationary point) of if 
and
, or if one of these partial derivatives does not exist. Theorem 2 says that
if 
has a local maximum or minimum at 
, then 
is a critical point of .
However, as in single-variable calculus, not all critical points give rise to maxima or
minima. At a critical point, a function could have a local maximum or a local mini-
mum or neither.
EXAMPLE 1 Let 
. Then
These partial derivatives are equal to 0 when 
and 
, so the only critical
point is 
. By completing the square, we ﬁnd that
Since 
and 
, we have 
for all values of and .
Therefore 
is a local minimum, and in fact it is the absolute minimum 
of . This can be conﬁrmed geometrically from the graph of 
which is the elliptic
paraboloid with vertex 
shown in Figure 2.
■
EXAMPLE 2 Find the extreme values of 
.
SOLUTION Since 
and 
, the only critical point is 
. Notice
that for points on the -axis we have 
, so 
(if 
). How-
ever, for points on the -axis we have 
, so 
(if 
). Thus
every disk with center 
contains points where 
takes positive values as well as
points where 
takes negative values. Therefore 
can’t be an extreme
value for , so 
has no extreme value.
■
Example 2 illustrates the fact that a function need not have a maximum or mini-
mum value at a critical point. Figure 3 shows how this is possible. The graph of 
is
the hyperbolic paraboloid 
, which has a horizontal tangent plane (
)
at the origin. You can see that 
is a maximum in the direction of the -axis
but a minimum in the direction of the -axis. Near the origin the graph has the shape
of a saddle and so 
is called a saddle point of .
We need to be able to determine whether or not a function has an extreme value at
a critical point. The following test, which is proved in Appendix C, is analogous to the
Second Derivative Test for functions of one variable.

SECOND DERIVATIVES TEST Suppose the second partial derivatives of
are con tin uous on a disk with center 
, and suppose that 
and
[that is, 
is a critical point of ]. Let
(a) If 
and 
, then 
is a local minimum.
(b) If 
and 
, then 
is a local maximum.
(c) If 
, then 
is not a local maximum or minimum.
NOTE 1 In case (c) the point 
is called a saddle point of 
and the graph of
crosses its tangent plane at 
.
NOTE 2 If 
, the test gives no information: 
could have a local maximum or
local minimum at 
, or 
could be a saddle point of .
NOTE 3 To remember the formula for 
it’s helpful to write it as a determinant:
EXAMPLE 3 Find the local maximum and minimum values and saddle points of
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst locate the critical points:
Setting these partial derivatives equal to 0, we obtain the equations
To solve these equations we substitute 
from the ﬁrst equation into the second
one. This gives
so there are three real roots: 
, , 
. The three critical points are 
, 
, 
and

We can express 
as a function of just two variables and by using the fact that
the area of the four sides and the bottom of the box is
Solving this equation for , we get 
, so the expression for
becomes
We compute the partial derivatives:
If

gives 
, so
we must solve the equations
These imply that 
and so

this problem.) If we put

, and 
.
We could use the Second Derivatives Test to show that this gives a local maxi-
mum of , or we could simply argue from the physical nature of this problem that
there must be an absolute maximum volume, which has to occur at a critical point 
of , so it must occur when

, so the
maximum volume of the box is 4 m .

ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES
For a function 
of one variable the Extreme Value Theorem says that if 
is continu-
ous on a closed interval 
, then 
has an absolute minimum value and an absolute
maximum value. According to the Closed Interval Method in Section 3.1, we found
these by evaluating 
not only at the critical numbers but also at the endpoints and .
There is a similar situation for functions of two variables. Just as a closed interval
contains its endpoints, a closed set in 
is one that contains all its boundary points.
[A boundary point of D is a point 
such that every disk with center 
con-
tains points in D and also points not in D.] For instance, the disk
which consists of all points on and inside the circle 
, is a closed set
because it contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle
). But if even one point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would
not be closed. (See Figure 7.)
A bounded set in 
is one that is contained within some disk. In other words, it
is ﬁnite in extent. Then, in terms of closed and bounded sets, we can state the follow-
ing counterpart of the Extreme Value Theorem in two dimensions.

EXTREME VALUE THEOREM FOR FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES If 
is
continuous on a closed, bounded set 
in 
, then 
attains an absolute maxi-
mum value 
and an absolute minimum value 
at some points
and 
in .
To ﬁnd the extreme values guaranteed by Theorem 4, we note that, by Theorem 2,
if 
has an extreme value at 
, then 
is either a critical point of 
or a
boundary point of 
. Thus we have the following extension of the Closed Interval
Method.
To ﬁnd the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous func-
tion 
on a closed, bounded set 
:
1. Find the values of 
at the critical points of 
in .
2. Find the extreme values of 
on the boundary of .
3. The largest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum
value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.
EXAMPLE 6 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function
on the rectangle 
.
SOLUTION Since 
is a polynomial, it is continuous on the closed, bounded rect-
angle , so Theorem 4 tells us there is both an absolute maximum and an absolute
minimum. According to step 1 in 
, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the critical points. These occur
when
so the only critical point is 
, and the value of 
there is 
.
In step 2 we look at the values of 
on the boundary of , which consists of the
four line segments 
, 
, 
, 
shown in Figure 8. On 
we have 
and
This is an increasing function of , so its minimum value is 
and its
maximum value is 
. On 
we have 
and
This is a decreasing function of , so its maximum value is 
and its mini-
mum value is 
. On 
we have 
and
By the methods of Chapter 3, or simply by observing that 
, we
see that the minimum value of this function is 
and the maximum value
is 
. Finally, on 
we have

11.8
LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
In Example 5 in Section 11.7 we maximized a volume function 
subject to the
constraint 
, which expressed the side condition that the surface
area was 12 m . In this section we present Lagrange’s method for maximizing or min-
imizing a general function 
subject to a constraint (or side condition) of the
form 
.
It’s easier to explain the geometric basis of Lagrange’s method for functions of two
variables. So we start by trying to ﬁnd the extreme values of 
subject to a con-
straint of the form 
. In other words, we seek the extreme values of 
when the point 
is restricted to lie on the level curve 
. Figure 1 shows
this curve together with several level curves of . These have the equations
where
, , , 
, 
. To maximize 
subject to 
is to ﬁnd the
largest value of such that the level curve 
intersects 
. It appears
from Figure 1 that this happens when these curves just touch each other, that is, when
they have a common tangent line. (Otherwise, the value of c could be increased fur-
ther.) This means that the normal lines at the point 
where they touch are iden-
tical. So the gradient vectors are parallel; that is, 
for some
scalar .
This kind of argument also applies to the problem of ﬁnding the extreme values of
subject to the constraint 
. Thus the point 
is restricted to
lie on the level surface 
with equation 
. Instead of the level curves in
Figure 1, we consider the level surfaces 
and argue that if the maximum
value of 
is 
, then the level surface 
is tangent to the
level surface 
and so the corresponding gradient vectors are parallel.
This intuitive argument can be made precise as follows. Suppose that a function
has an extreme value at a point 
on the surface and let 
be a curve with
vector equation 
that lies on 
and passes through . If 
is the
parameter value corresponding to the point , then 
. The compos-
ite function 
represents the values that 
takes on the curve .
Since 
has an extreme value at 
, it follows that 
has an extreme value at

, so 
. But if 
is differentiable, we can use the Chain Rule to write
This shows that the gradient vector 
is orthogonal to the tangent vector
to every such curve . But we already know from Section 11.6 that the gradient
vector of , 
, is also orthogonal to 
. (See Equation 11.6.18.) This
means that the gradient vectors 
and 
must be parallel.
There fore if 
, there is a number 
such that
The number in Equation 1 is called a Lagrange multiplier. The procedure based
on Equation 1 is as follows.
METHOD OF LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS To ﬁnd the maximum and minimum
values of 
subject to the constraint 
[assuming that these
extreme values exist and 
on the surface 
]:
(a) Find all values of , , , and 
such that
and
(b) Evaluate 
at all the points 
that result from step (a). The largest of
these values is the maximum value of ; the smallest is the minimum
value of .
If we write the vector equation 
in terms of its components, then the equa -
tions in step (a) become
This is a system of four equations in the four unknowns , , , and , but it is not neces -
 sary to ﬁnd explicit values for .
For functions of two variables the method of Lagrange multipliers is similar to the
method just described. To ﬁnd the extreme values of 
subject to the constraint
, we look for values of , , and 
such that

Our ﬁrst illustration of Lagrange’s method is to reconsider the problem given in
Example 5 in Section 11.7.
EXAMPLE 1 A rectangular box without a lid is to be made from 12 m of card-
board. Find the maximum volume of such a box.
SOLUTION As in Example 5 in Section 11.7 we let , , and be the length, width,
and height, respectively, of the box, in meters. Then we wish to maximize
subject to the constraint
Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we look for values of , , , and 
such

and 
. This gives the equations
which become
There are no general rules for solving systems of equations. Sometimes some inge-
nuity is required. In the present example you might notice that if we multiply 
by 
by , and 
by , then the left sides of these equations will be identical.
Doing this, we have
We observe that 
because 
would imply 
from 
, 
, and 
and this would contradict 
. Therefore from 
and 
we have
which gives 
. But 
(since 
would give

. From
and 
we have
which gives 
and so (since 
)

Since , , and are all positive, we therefore have

EXAMPLE 2 Find the extreme values of the function

SOLUTION We are asked for the extreme values of

at the points 
, 
, 
, and 
. Evaluating 
at these four points, we
ﬁnd that
Therefore the maximum value of 
on the circle 
is 
and
the minimum value is 
. Checking with Figure 2, we see that these
values look reasonable.

EXAMPLE 3 Find the extreme values of 
on the disk 
.
SOLUTION According to the procedure in (11.7.5), we compare the values of 
at
the critical points with values at the points on the boundary. Since 
and
, the only critical point is 
. We compare the value of 
at that point
with the extreme values on the boundary from Example 2:
Therefore the maximum value of 
on the disk 
is 
and the
minimum value is 
.
■
EXAMPLE 4 Find the points on the sphere 
that are closest to and
farthest from the point 
.
SOLUTION The distance from a point 
to the point 
is
but the algebra is simpler if we instead maximize and minimize the square of the 
distance:
The constraint is that the point

of the level surfaces

at a point 
. We know from the beginning of this section that

onal to 
there. But we also know that

is
orthogonal to

and 
are both orthogonal to . This means that
the gradient vector 
is in the plane determined by 
and

12.1
DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER RECTANGLES
In much the same way that our attempt to solve the area problem led to the deﬁnition
of a deﬁnite integral, we now seek to ﬁnd the volume of a solid and in the process we
arrive at the deﬁnition of a double integral.
REVIEW OF THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
First let’s recall the basic facts concerning deﬁnite integrals of functions of a single
variable. If 
is deﬁned for 
, we start by dividing the interval 
into
n subintervals 
with length 
and we choose sample points
in these subintervals as in Figure 1. Then we form the Riemann sum
and take the limit of such sums as the largest of the lengths approaches to obtain the
deﬁnite integral of 
from 
to :
In the special case where 
, the Riemann sum can be interpreted as the sum of
the areas of the approximating rectangles in Figure 1, and 
represents the
area under the curve 
from 
to .
VOLUMES AND DOUBLE INTEGRALS
In a similar manner we consider a function 
of two variables deﬁned on a closed 
rectangle
and we ﬁrst suppose that
. The graph of f is a surface with equation
. Let S be the solid that lies above R and under the graph of f, that is,
(See Figure 2.) Our goal is to ﬁnd the volume of S.

MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
In this chapter we extend the idea of a definite integral to double and triple integrals of functions of
two or three variables. These ideas are then used to compute volumes, masses, and centroids of more
general regions than we were able to consider in Chapter 7. We will see that polar coordinates are 
useful in computing double integrals over some types of regions. In a similar way, we will introduce 
two new coordinate systems in three-dimensional space––cylindrical coordinates and spherical coor-
dinates––that greatly simplify the computation of triple integrals over certain commonly occurring
solid regions.

MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

The ﬁrst step is to take a partition 
of 
into subrectangles. This is accomplished
by dividing the intervals 
and 
as follows:
By drawing lines parallel to the coordinate axes through these partition points as in
Figure 3, we form the subrectangles
for 
and 
. There are 
of these subrectangles, and they
cover . If we let 
and 
, then the area of 
is
If we choose a sample point
in each 
, then we can approximate the part
of S that lies above each 
by a thin rectangular box (or “column”) with base 
and
height 
as shown in Figure 4. (Compare with Figure 1.) The volume of this
box is the height of the box times the area of the base rectangle:
If we follow this procedure for all the rectangles and add the volumes of the corre-
sponding boxes, we get an approximation to the total volume of S:
(See Figure 5.) This double Riemann sum means that for each subrectangle we eval-
uate 
at the chosen point and multiply by the area of the subrectangle, and then we
add the results.

SECTION 12.1  DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER RECTANGLES

Our intuition tells us that the approximation given in 
becomes better as the sub-
rectangles become smaller. So if we denote by 
, 
the largest of the lengths
of all the subintervals, we would expect that
We use the expression in Equation 4 to deﬁne the volume of the solid that lies under
the graph of 
and above the rectangle . (It can be shown that this deﬁnition is con-
sistent with our formula for volume in Section 7.2.)
Limits of the type that appear in Equation 4 occur frequently, not just in ﬁnding
volumes but in a variety of other situations as well—as we will see in Section 12.4—
even when 
is not a positive function. So we make the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION The double integral of 
over the rectangle 
is
if this limit exists.
The precise meaning of the limit in Deﬁnition 5 is that for every number
there is a corresponding number 
such that
for all partitions 
of 
whose subinterval lengths are less than , and for any choice
of sample points 
in 
A function 
is called integrable if the limit in Deﬁnition 5 exists. It is shown in
courses on advanced calculus that all continuous functions are integrable. In fact, the
double integral of 
exists provided that 
is “not too discontinuous.” In particular,

if 
is bounded [that is, there is a constant 
such that 
for all 
in ], and 
is continuous there, except on a ﬁnite number of smooth curves, then
is integrable over .
If we know that 
is integrable, we can choose the partitions 
to be regular, that
is, all the subrectangles 
have the same dimensions and therefore the same area:
. In this case we can simply let 
and 
. In addition, the sam-
ple point 
can be chosen to be any point in the subrectangle 
but if we
choose it to be the upper right-hand corner of 
[namely 
, see Fig ure 3], then
the expression for the double integral looks simpler:
By comparing Deﬁnitions 4 and 5, we see that a volume can be written as a double
integral:
If 
, then the volume 
of the solid that lies above the rectangle
and below the surface 
is
The sum in Deﬁnition 5,
is called a double Riemann sum and is used as an approximation to the value of the 
double integral. [Notice how similar it is to the Riemann sum in 
for a function of
a single variable.] If happens to be a positive function, then the double Riemann sum 
represents the sum of volumes of columns, as in Figure 5, and is an approximation to
the volume under the graph of .
EXAMPLE 1 Estimate the volume of the solid that lies above the square
and below the elliptic paraboloid 
. Divide 
into four equal squares and choose the sample point to be the upper right corner
of each square 
. Sketch the solid and the approximating rectangular boxes.
SOLUTION The squares are shown in Figure 6. The paraboloid is the graph of
and the area of each square is 1. Approximating the vol-
ume by the Riemann sum with 
, we have
This is the volume of the approximating rectangular boxes shown in Figure 7.

We get better approximations to the volume in Example 1 if we increase the num-
ber of squares. Figure 8 shows how the columns start to look more like the actual solid
and the corresponding approximations become more accurate when we use 16, 64, and
256 squares. In Example 7 we will be able to show that the exact volume is 48.
EXAMPLE 2 If 
, evaluate the integral
SOLUTION It would be very difﬁcult to evaluate this integral directly from Deﬁni-
tion 5 but, because 
, we can compute the integral by interpreting it as a
volume. If 
, then 
and 
, so the given double integral
represents the volume of the solid S that lies below the circular cylinder
and above the rectangle R. (See Figure 9.) The volume of S is the area of a semicircle
with radius 1 times the length of the cylinder. Thus
■
THE MIDPOINT RULE
The methods that we used for approximating single integrals (the Midpoint Rule, the
Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule) all have counterparts for double integrals. Here we
consider only the Midpoint Rule for double integrals. This means that we use a double
Riemann sum with a regular partition to approximate the double integral, where all the
subrectangles have area 
and the sample point 
in 
is chosen to be the
center 
of 
. In other words, 
is the midpoint of 
and 
is the mid-
point of 
.

NOTE In Example 5 we will see that the exact value of the double integral in
Example 3 is 
. (Remember that the interpretation of a double integral as a volume
is valid only when the integrand 
is a positive function. The integrand in Example 3
is not a positive function, so its integral is not a volume. In Examples 5 and 6 we will
discuss how to interpret integrals of functions that are not always positive in terms of
volumes.) If we keep dividing each subrectangle in Figure 10 into four smaller ones
with similar shape, we get the Midpoint Rule approximations displayed in the chart in
the margin. Notice how these approximations approach the exact value of the double
integral, 
.
ITERATED INTEGRALS
Recall that it is usually difﬁcult to evaluate single integrals directly from the deﬁnition
of an integral, but the Evaluation Theorem (Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus) provides a much easier method. The evaluation of double integrals from ﬁrst
principles is even more difﬁcult, but here we see how to express a double integral as
an iterated integral, which can then be evaluated by calculating two single integrals.
Suppose that 
is a function of two variables that is continuous on the rectangle
. We use the notation 
to mean that is held ﬁxed and
is integrated with respect to 
from 
to 
. This procedure is called
partial integration with respect to . (Notice its similarity to partial differentiation.)
Now 
is a number that depends on the value of , so it deﬁnes a function
of :

means that we ﬁrst integrate with respect to 
from to

from

Similarly, the iterated integral
means that we ﬁrst integrate with respect to 
(holding 
ﬁxed) from

and then we integrate the resulting function of with respect to from 
to
Notice that in both Equations 8 and 9 we work from the inside out.

(a) Regarding as a constant, we obtain
Thus the function 
in the preceding discussion is given by 
in this
example. We now integrate this function of from 0 to 3:
(b) Here we ﬁrst integrate with respect to :
■
Notice that in Example 4 we obtained the same answer whether we integrated with
respect to 
or 
ﬁrst. In general, it turns out (see Theorem 10) that the two iterated
integrals in Equations 8 and 9 are always equal; that is, the order of integration does
not matter. (This is similar to Clairaut’s Theorem on the equality of the mixed partial
derivatives.)
The following theorem gives a practical method for evaluating a double integral by
expressing it as an iterated integral (in either order).

FUBINI’S THEOREM If 
is continuous on the rectangle 
, 
, then
More generally, this is true if we assume that 
is bounded on , 
is discon-
tinuous only on a ﬁnite number of smooth curves, and the iterated integrals
exist.
The proof of Fubini’s Theorem is too difﬁcult to include in this book, but we can
at least give an intuitive indication of why it is true for the case where 
.
Recall that if 
is positive, then we can interpret the double integral 
as
the volume 
of the solid 
that lies above 
and under the surface 
. But
we have another formula that we used for volume in Chapter 7, namely,
where 
is the area of a cross-section of 
in the plane through perpendicular to
the -axis. From Figure 11 you can see that 
is the area under the curve 
whose
equation is 
, where is held constant and 
. Therefore
and we have
A similar argument, using cross-sections perpendicular to the -axis as in Figure 12,
shows that

■Theorem 10 is named after the Italian 
mathematician Guido Fubini (1879–1943), 
who proved a very general version of this 
theorem in 1907. But the version for con-
tinuous functions was known to the French
mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy
almost a century earlier.

■Notice the negative answer in Exam-
ple 5; nothing is wrong with that. The
function in that example is not a posi-
tive function, so its integral doesn’t rep-
resent a volume. From Figure 13 we see
that is always negative on , so the
value of the integral is the negative of
the volume that lies above the graph of 
and below

but this order of integration is much more difﬁcult than the method given in the exam-
ple because it involves integration by parts twice. Therefore, when we evaluate dou-
ble integrals, it is wise to choose the order of integration that gives simpler integrals.
EXAMPLE 7 Find the volume of the solid 
that is bounded by the elliptic 
paraboloid 
, the planes 
and 
, and the three coor-
dinate planes.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst observe that is the solid that lies under the surface
and above the square 
. (See Figure 15.) This
solid was considered in Example 1, but we are now in a position to evaluate the
double integral using Fubini’s Theorem. Therefore
■
In the special case where 
can be factored as the product of a function of 
only and a function of only, the double integral of 
can be written in a particularly
simple form. To be speciﬁc, suppose that 
and 
.
Then Fubini’s Theorem gives
In the inner integral is a constant, so 
is a constant and we can write
since 
is a constant. Therefore, in this case, the double integral of

written as the product of two single integrals:

12.2
DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER GENERAL REGIONS
For single integrals, the region over which we integrate is always an interval. But for 
double integrals, we want to be able to integrate a function 
not just over rectangles
but also over regions 
of more general shape, such as the one illustrated in Figure 1.
We suppose that 
is a bounded region, which means that 
can be enclosed in a rect-
angular region 
as in Figure 2. Then we deﬁne a new function 
with domain 
by
If the double integral of F exists over R, then we deﬁne the double integral of
over 
D by
Deﬁnition 2 makes sense because R is a rectangle and so 
has been
previously deﬁned in Section 12.1. The procedure that we have used is reasonable
because the values of 
are 0 when 
lies outside 
and so they contribute
nothing to the integral. This means that it doesn’t matter what rectangle 
we use as
long as it contains .

In the case where 
we can still interpret 
as the volume of
the solid that lies above 
and under the surface 
(the graph of ). You can
see that this is reasonable by comparing the graphs of 
and 
in Figures 3 and 4 and
remembering that

Figure 4 also shows that 
is likely to have discontinuities at the boundary points
of 
Nonetheless, if

and the boundary curve of 
is “well
behaved” (in a sense outside the scope of this book), then it can be shown that
exists and therefore 
exists. In particular, this is the case for
the following types of regions.
A plane region 
is said to be of type I if it lies between the graphs of two contin-
uous functions of , that is,
where 
and 
are continuous on 
. Some examples of type I regions are shown
in Figure 5.
In order to evaluate 
when 
is a region of type I, we choose a rect-
angle 
that contains 
, as in Figure 6, and we let 
be the func-
tion given by Equation 1; that is, 
agrees with 
on 
and 
is outside . Then, by
Fubini’s Theorem,
Observe that

. Thus we have the following for-
mula that enables us to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral.
If 
is continuous on a type I region D such that
then
The integral on the right side of 
is an iterated integral that is similar to the ones
we considered in the preceding section, except that in the inner integral we regard
as being constant not only in 
but also in the limits of integration, 
and 
We also consider plane regions of type II, which can be expressed as 
where 
and 
are continuous. Two such regions are illustrated in Figure 7.
Using the same methods that were used in establishing 
, we can show that
where D is a type II region given by Equation 4.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where 
is the region bounded by the 
parabolas 
and 
.
SOLUTION The parabolas intersect when 
, that is, 
, so 
.
We note that the region , sketched in Figure 8, is a type I region but not a type II
region and we can write
Since the lower boundary is

NOTE When we set up a double integral as in Example 1, it is essential to draw a
diagram. Often it is helpful to draw a vertical arrow as in Figure 8. Then the limits of 
integration for the inner integral can be read from the diagram as follows: The arrow 
starts at the lower boundary 
, which gives the lower limit in the integral, and 
the arrow ends at the upper boundary 
, which gives the upper limit of inte-
gration. For a type II region the arrow is drawn horizontally from the left boundary to
the right boundary.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid that lies under the paraboloid
and above the region 
in the 
-plane bounded by the line 
and the parabola

SOLUTION 1 From Figure 9 we see that 
is a type I region and
Therefore the volume under

is
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 10 we see that 
can also be written as a type II region:
Therefore another expression for

SOLUTION The region 
is shown in Figure 12. Again 
is both type I and type II,
but the description of 
as a type I region is more complicated because the lower
boundary consists of two parts. Therefore we prefer to express 
as a type II region:
Then 
gives
If we had expressed 
as a type I region using Figure 12(a), then we would have
obtained
but this would have involved more work than the other method.

EXAMPLE 4 Find the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by the planes
, 
, 
, and

SOLUTION In a question such as this, it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of the
three-dimensional solid and another of the plane region 
over which it lies. 
Figure 13 shows the tetrahedron 
bounded by the coordinate planes 
, 
,
the vertical plane 
, and the plane 
. Since the plane
intersects the 
-plane (whose equation is 
) in the line
, we see that 
lies above the triangular region 
in the 
-plane 
bounded by the lines 
, 
, and

EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate the iterated integral 
.
SOLUTION If we try to evaluate the integral as it stands, we are faced with the task 
of ﬁrst evaluating 
. But it’s impossible to do so in ﬁnite terms since
is not an elementary function. (See the end of Section 6.4.) So we must
change the order of integration. This is accomplished by ﬁrst expressing the given
iterated integral as a double integral. Using 
backward, we have
where
We sketch this region 
in Figure 15. Then from Figure 16 we see that an alterna-
tive description of 
is
This enables us to use 
to express the double integral as an iterated integral in the
reverse order:

PROPERTIES OF DOUBLE INTEGRALS

If

The next property of double integrals is similar to the property of single integrals
given by the equation 
.
If 
, where 
and 
don’t overlap except perhaps on their bound-
aries (see Figure 17), then
Property 9 can be used to evaluate double integrals over regions 
that are neither
type I nor type II but can be expressed as a union of regions of type I or type II. Fig-
ure 18 illustrates this procedure. (See Exercises 49 and 50.)
The next property of integrals says that if we integrate the constant function
over a region , we get the area of 
:
Figure 19 illustrates why Equation 10 is true: A solid cylinder whose base is 
and
whose height is 1 has volume 
, but we know that we can also write
its volume as 
.
Finally, we can combine Properties 7, 8, and 10 to prove the following property.

gular coordinates is rather complicated but 
is easily described using polar coordinates.
Recall from Figure 2 that the polar coordinates

which is shown in Figure 3. In order to compute the double integral 
,
where 
is a polar rectangle, we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals 
with lengths 
and we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals
with lengths 
. Then the circles 
and the rays 
divide the polar rectangle R into the small polar rectangles shown in Figure 4.
The “center” of the polar subrectangle
has polar coordinates
We compute the area of 
using the fact that the area of a sector of a circle with radius
and central angle 
is 
. Subtracting the areas of two such sectors, each of which
has central angle 
, we ﬁnd that the area of

Although we have deﬁned the double integral 
in terms of ordinary
rectangles, it can be shown that, for continuous functions , we always obtain the 
same answer using polar rectangles. The rectangular coordinates of the center of

EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid bounded by the plane 
and the
paraboloid 
.
SOLUTION If we put 
in the equation of the paraboloid, we get 
.
This means that the plane intersects the paraboloid in the circle 
, so the
solid lies under the paraboloid and above the circular disk 
given by
[see Figures 6 and 1(a)]. In polar coordinates 
is given by 
, 
.
Since 
, the volume is
If we had used rectangular coordinates instead of polar coordinates, then we would
have obtained
which is not easy to evaluate because it involves ﬁnding 
.
■
What we have done so far can be extended to the more complicated type of region
shown in Figure 7. It’s similar to the type II rectangular regions considered in Sec-
tion 12.2. In fact, by combining Formula 2 in this section with Formula 12.2.5, we
obtain the following formula.
If 
is continuous on a polar region of the form
then
In particular, taking 
, 
, and 
in this formula, we
see that the area of the region 
bounded by 
, 
, and 
is
and this agrees with Formula 9.4.3.

12.4
APPLICATIONS OF DOUBLE INTEGRALS
We have already seen one application of double integrals: computing volumes. 
Another geometric application is ﬁnding areas of surfaces and this will be done in the
next chapter. In this section we explore physical applications such as computing mass,
electric charge, center of mass, and moment of inertia.
DENSITY AND MASS
In Chapter 7 we were able to use single integrals to compute moments and the center
of mass of a thin plate or lamina with constant density. But now, equipped with the
double integral, we can consider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina
occupies a region 
of the 
-plane and its density (in units of mass per unit area) at
a point 
in 
is given by 
, where 
is a continuous function on 
. This
means that
where 
and 
are the mass and area of a small rectangle that contains 
and
the limit is taken as the dimensions of the rectangle approach 0. (See Figure 1.)
To ﬁnd the total mass 
of the lamina we divide a rectangle 
containing 
into
subrectangles 
(as in Figure 2) and consider 
to be 0 outside . If we choose
a point 
in 
, then the mass of the part of the lamina that occupies 
is
approximately 
, where 
is the area of 
. If we add all such masses,
we get an approximation to the total mass:
If we now take ﬁner partitions by using smaller subrectangles, we obtain the total
mass 
of the lamina as the limiting value of the approximations:
Physicists also consider other types of density that can be treated in the same man-
ner. For example, if an electric charge is distributed over a region 
and the charge
density (in units of charge per unit area) is given by 
at a point 
in , then
the total charge 
is given by
EXAMPLE 1 Charge is distributed over the triangular region 
in Figure 3 so that
the charge density at 
is 
, measured in coulombs per square meter
(Cm ). Find the total charge.

MOMENTS AND CENTERS OF MASS
In Section 7.6 we found the center of mass of a lamina with constant density; here we
consider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a region 
and
has density function 
. Recall from Chapter 7 that we deﬁned the moment of a
particle about an axis as the product of its mass and its directed distance from the axis.
We divide 
into small rectangles as in Figure 2. Then the mass of 
is approximately
, so we can approximate the moment of 
with respect to the -axis by
If we now add these quantities and take the limit as the subrectangles be come smaller,
we obtain the moment of the entire lamina about the x-axis:
Similarly, the moment about the y-axis is 
As before, we deﬁne the center of mass 
so that 
and 
. The
physical signiﬁcance is that the lamina behaves as if its entire mass is concentrated at
its center of mass. Thus the lamina balances horizontally when supported at its center
of mass (see Figure 4).
The coordinates 
of the center of mass of a lamina occupying the
region 
and having density function 
are
where the mass 
is given by

EXAMPLE 2 Find the mass and center of mass of a triangular lamina with ver-
tices

, and 
if the density function is 
.
SOLUTION The triangle is shown in Figure 5. (Note that the equation of the upper
boundary is 
.) The mass of the lamina is
Then the formulas in 
give
The center of mass is at the point 
.
■
EXAMPLE 3 The density at any point on a semicircular lamina is proportional to
the distance from the center of the circle. Find the center of mass of the lamina.
SOLUTION Let’s place the lamina as the upper half of the circle 
. (See
Fig ure 6.) Then the distance from a point 
to the center of the circle (the origin)
is 
. Therefore the density function is
where 
is some constant. Both the density function and the shape of the lamina
suggest that we convert to polar coordinates. Then 
and the region
is given by 
, 
. Thus the mass of the lamina is
Both the lamina and the density function are symmetric with respect to the -axis, so

■Compare the location of the center of
mass in Example 3 with Example 8 in
Section 7.6 where we found that the
center of mass of a lamina with the
same shape but uniform density is
located at the point

the center of mass must lie on the -axis, that is,

Therefore the center of mass is located at the point

MOMENT OF INERTIA
The moment of inertia (also called the second moment) of a particle of mass
about an axis is deﬁned to be 
, where is the distance from the particle to the axis.
We extend this concept to a lamina with density function 
and occupying a
region 
by proceeding as we did for ordinary moments. We divide 
into small 
rect angles, approximate the moment of inertia of each subrectangle about the -axis,
and take the limit of the sum as the subrectangles become smaller. The result is the
moment of inertia of the lamina about the x-axis:
Similarly, the moment of inertia about the y-axis is
It is also of interest to consider the moment of inertia about the origin, also called
the polar moment of inertia:
Note that

. Let’s compute 
ﬁrst:
Instead of computing 
and 
directly, we use the facts that 
and
(from the symmetry of the problem). Thus
■
In Example 4 notice that the mass of the disk is
so the moment of inertia of the disk about the origin (like a wheel about its axle) can
be written as
Thus if we increase the mass or the radius of the disk, we thereby increase the mo-
ment of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia plays much the same role in rota-
tional motion that mass plays in linear motion. The moment of inertia of a wheel is
what makes it difﬁcult to start or stop the rotation of the wheel, just as the mass of a
car is what makes it difﬁcult to start or stop the motion of the car.
The radius of gyration of a lamina about an axis is the number 
such that
where 
is the mass of the lamina and is the moment of inertia about the given axis.
Equation 9 says that if the mass of the lamina were concentrated at a distance 
from
the axis, then the moment of inertia of this “point mass” would be the same as the
moment of inertia of the lamina.
In particular, the radius of gyration 
with respect to the -axis and the radius of
gyration with respect to the -axis are given by the equations
Thus 
is the point at which the mass of the lamina can be concentrated without
changing the moments of inertia with respect to the coordinate axes. (Note the anal-
ogy with the center of mass.)
EXAMPLE 5 Find the radius of gyration about the -axis of the disk in Example 4.
SOLUTION As noted, the mass of the disk is 
, so from Equations 10 we
have
Therefore the radius of gyration about the -axis is 
, half the radius of the
disk.

TRIPLE INTEGRALS
Just as we deﬁned single integrals for functions of one variable and double integrals
for functions of two variables, so we can deﬁne triple integrals for functions of three
variables. Let’s ﬁrst deal with the simplest case where is deﬁned on a rectangular box:

The ﬁrst step is to divide B into sub-boxes. We do this by dividing the interval 
into subintervals 
with lengths 
, dividing 
into 
sub-
intervals with lengths 
, and dividing 
into 
subintervals with
lengths 
. The planes through the endpoints of these subintervals paral-
lel to the coordinate planes divide the box 
into 
sub-boxes
which are shown in Figure 1. The sub-box 
has volume 
.
Then we form the triple Riemann sum
where the sample point 
is in 
. By analogy with the deﬁnition of a
double integral (12.1.5), we deﬁne the triple integral as the limit of the triple Riemann
sums in 
as the sub-boxes shrink.
DEFINITION The triple integral of 
over the box 
is
if this limit exists.
Again, the triple integral always exists if is continuous. We can choose the sample
point to be any point in the sub-box, but if we choose it to be the point 
, and if
we choose sub-boxes with the same dimensions, so that 
, we get a simpler-
looking expression for the triple integral:
Just as for double integrals, the practical method for evaluating triple integrals is to
express them as iterated integrals as follows.
FUBINI’S THEOREM FOR TRIPLE INTEGRALS If 
is continuous on the
rectangular box 
, then
The iterated integral on the right side of Fubini’s Theorem means that we integrate
ﬁrst with respect to (keeping and ﬁxed), then we integrate with respect to (keep-
ing 
ﬁxed), and ﬁnally we integrate with respect to . There are ﬁve other possible
orders in which we can integrate, all of which give the same value. For instance, if we

SOLUTION We could use any of the six possible orders of integration. If we choose

Now we deﬁne the triple integral over a general bounded region E in three-
dimensional space (a solid) by much the same procedure that we used for double inte-
grals (12.2.2). We enclose 
in a box 
of the type given by Equation 1. Then we
deﬁne a function 
so that it agrees with 
on 
but is 0 for points in 
that are out-
side . By deﬁnition,
This integral exists if 
is continuous and the boundary of 
is “reasonably smooth.”
The triple integral has essentially the same properties as the double integral (Proper-
ties 6–9 in Section 12.2).
We restrict our attention to continuous functions 
and to certain simple types of
regions. A solid region 
is said to be of type 1 if it lies between the graphs of two
continuous functions of and , that is,
where 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane as shown in Figure 2. Notice that the
upper boundary of the solid 
is the surface with equation 
, while the
lower boundary is the surface 
.
By the same sort of argument that led to (12.2.3), it can be shown that if 
is a 
type 1 region given by Equation 5, then
The meaning of the inner integral on the right side of Equation 6 is that 
and 
are
held ﬁxed, and therefore 
and 
are regarded as constants, while

A solid region 
is of type 2 if it is of the form
where, this time, 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane (see Figure 7). The back
surface is

, and we have
Finally, a type 3 region is of the form
where 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane, 
is the left surface, and
is the right surface (see Figure 8). For this type of region we have
In each of Equations 10 and 11 there may be two possible expressions for the inte-
gral depending on whether 
is a type I or type II plane region (and corresponding to
Equa tions 7 and 8).
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate 
, where 
is the region bounded by the
paraboloid 
and the plane

SOLUTION The solid 
is shown in Figure 9. If we regard it as a type 1 region,
then we need to consider its projection 
onto the 
-plane, which is the parabolic
region in Figure 10. (The trace of 
in the plane 
is the parabola
.)
From 
we obtain 
, so the lower boundary surface of
is 
and the upper surface is

Although this expression is correct, it is extremely difﬁcult to evaluate. So let’s
instead consider

onto the

Then the left boundary of

| The most difﬁcult step in evaluating
a triple integral is setting up an expres-
sion for the region of integration (such as
Equation 9 in Example 2). Remem ber
that the limits of integra tion in the inner
integral contain at most two variables,
the limits of integration in the middle
integral contain at most one variable, and
the limits of integration in the outer inte-
gral must be constants.

APPLICATIONS OF TRIPLE INTEGRALS
Recall that if 
, then the single integral 
represents the area under the
curve 
from to , and if 
, then the double integral
represents the volume under the surface 
and above . The corresponding
interpretation of a triple integral 
, where 
, is not very
useful because it would be the “hypervolume” of a four-dimensional object and, of
course, that is very difﬁcult to visualize. (Remember that 
is just the domain of the
function ; the graph of 
lies in four-dimensional space.) Nonetheless, the triple inte-
gral 
can be interpreted in different ways in different physical situa-
tions, depending on the physical interpretations of , , and 
.
Let’s begin with the special case where 
for all points in . Then the
triple integral does represent the volume of :
For example, you can see this in the case of a type 1 region by putting
in Formula 6:
and from Section 12.2 we know this represents the volume that lies between the sur-
faces 
and 
.
EXAMPLE 5 Use a triple integral to ﬁnd the volume of the tetrahedron 
bounded
by the planes 
, 
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION The tetrahedron 
and its projection 
on the 
-plane are shown in
Fig ures 14 and 15. The lower boundary of 
is the plane 
and the upper
boundary is the plane 
, that is, 
. Therefore we have
by the same calculation as in Example 4 in Section 12.2.

simply give an alternative method for setting up the calculation.)

All the applications of double integrals in Section 12.4 can be immediately ex -
tended to triple integrals. For example, if the density function of a solid object that
occupies the region 
is 
, in units of mass per unit volume, at any given point
, then its mass is
and its moments about the three coordinate planes are
The center of mass is located at the point 
, where
If the density is constant, the center of mass of the solid is called the centroid of .
The moments of inertia about the three coordinate axes are
As in Section 12.4, the total electric charge on a solid object occupying a region
and having charge density 
is
EXAMPLE 6 Find the center of mass of a solid of constant density that is 
bounded by the parabolic cylinder 
and the planes

, and 
.
SOLUTION The solid 
and its projection onto the 
-plane are shown in Fig-
ure 16. The lower and upper surfaces of 
are the planes

TRIPLE INTEGRALS IN CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES
In plane geometry the polar coordinate system is used to give a convenient description
of certain curves and regions. (See Section 9.3.) Figure 1 enables us to recall the con-
nection between polar and Cartesian coordinates. If the point 
has Cartesian coordi-
nates 
and polar coordinates 
, then, from the ﬁgure,
In three dimensions there is a coordinate system, called cylindrical coordinates, that
is similar to polar coordinates and gives convenient descriptions of some commonly
occurring surfaces and solids. As we will see, some triple integrals are much easier to
evaluate in cylindrical coordinates.
CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES
In the cylindrical coordinate system, a point 
in three-dimensional space is repre-
sented by the ordered triple 
, where and 
are polar coordinates of the pro-
jection of 
onto the 
-plane and is the directed distance from the 
-plane to . (See
Figure 2.)
To convert from cylindrical to rectangular coordinates, we use the equations
whereas to convert from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates, we use
EXAMPLE 1

and ﬁnd its rectangular 
coordinates.
(b) Find cylindrical coordinates of the point with rectangular coordinates

SOLUTION

is plotted in Figure 3. From
Equations 1, its rectangular coordinates are
Thus the point is 
in rectangular coordinates.

(b) From Equations 2 we have
so    
Therefore one set of cylindrical coordinates is 
. Another is
. As with polar coordinates, there are inﬁnitely many choices.
■
Cylindrical coordinates are useful in problems that involve symmetry about an
axis, and the -axis is chosen to coincide with this axis of symmetry. For instance, the
axis of the circular cylinder with Cartesian equation 
is the -axis. In
cylindrical coordinates this cylinder has the very simple equation 
. (See Figure 4.)
This is the reason for the name “cylindrical” coordinates.
EXAMPLE 2 Describe the surface whose equation in cylindrical coordinates 
is 
.
SOLUTION The equation says that the -value, or height, of each point on the sur-
face is the same as r, the distance from the point to the -axis. Because 
doesn’t
appear, it can vary. So any horizontal trace in the plane 
is a circle of
radius k. These traces suggest that the surface is a cone. This prediction can be con-
ﬁrmed by converting the equation into rectangular coordinates. From the ﬁrst equa-
tion in 
we have
We recognize the equation 
(by comparison with Table 1 in Section 10.6)
as being a circular cone whose axis is the -axis (see Figure 5).

But we also know how to evaluate double integrals in polar coordinates. In fact, com-
bining Equation 3 with Equation 12.3.3, we obtain
Formula 4 is the formula for triple integration in cylindrical coordinates. It says
that we convert a triple integral from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates by writing
, 
, leaving 
as it is, using the appropriate limits of integration
for , , and , and replacing 
by 
. (Figure 7 shows how to remember this.)
It is worthwhile to use this formula when 
is a solid region easily described in cylin-
drical coordinates, and especially when the function 
involves the expression
.
EXAMPLE 3 A solid 
lies within the cylinder 
, below the plane
, and above the paraboloid 
. (See Figure 8.) The density at
any point is proportional to its distance from the axis of the cylinder. Find the mass
of .
SOLUTION In cylindrical coordinates the cylinder is 
and the paraboloid is
, so we can write
Since the density at 
is proportional to the distance from the -axis, the den-
sity function is
where 
is the proportionality constant. Therefore, from Formula 12.5.13, the mass
of 
is
■
EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION This iterated integral is a triple integral over the solid region 
and the projection of 
onto the

. The lower sur -
face of 
is the cone

TRIPLE INTEGRALS IN SPHERICAL COORDINATES
Another useful coordinate system in three dimensions is the spherical coordinate sys-
tem. It simpliﬁes the evaluation of triple integrals over regions bounded by spheres or
cones.
SPHERICAL COORDINATES
The spherical coordinates
of a point 
in space are shown in Figure 1,
where 
is the distance from the origin to , 
is the same angle as in cylin-
drical coordinates, and 
is the angle between the positive -axis and the line segment
. Note that
The spherical coordinate system is especially useful in problems where there is sym-
metry about a point, and the origin is placed at this point. For example, the sphere with

center the origin and radius has the simple equation 
(see Figure 2); this is the
reason for the name “spherical” coordinates. The graph of the equation 
is a ver-
tical half-plane (see Figure 3), and the equation 
represents a half-cone with the
-axis as its axis (see Figure 4).
The relationship between rectangular and spherical coordinates can be seen from

EXAMPLE 2 The point 
is given in rectangular coordinates. Find
spherical coordinates for this point.
SOLUTION From Equation 2 we have
and so Equations 1 give

EVALUATING TRIPLE INTEGRALS WITH SPHERICAL COORDINATES
In the spherical coordinate system the counterpart of a rectangular box is a spherical
wedge
where 
and 
, and 
. Although we deﬁned triple integrals
by dividing solids into small boxes, it can be shown that dividing a solid into small
spherical wedges always gives the same result. So we divide 
into smaller spherical
wedges
by means of spheres 
, half-planes 
, and half-cones 
.
Figure 7 shows that 
is approximately a rectangular box with dimensions 
,
(arc of a circle with radius 
angle 
), and 
(arc of a circle with
radius 
angle 
). So an approximation to the volume of 
is given by
In fact, it can be shown, with the aid of the Mean Value Theorem (Exercise 45), that
the volume of 
is given exactly by
where 
is some point in 
. Let 
be the rectangular coordi-
nates of this point. Then
But this sum is a Riemann sum for the function
Consequently, we have arrived at the following formula for triple integration in
spherical coordinates.

Formula 3 says that we convert a triple integral from rectangular coordinates to
spher ical coordinates by writing
using the appropriate limits of integration, and replacing 
by 
.
This is illustrated in Figure 8.
This formula can be extended to include more general spherical regions such as
In this case the formula is the same as in 
except that the limits of integration for
are 
and 
.
Usually, spherical coordinates are used in triple integrals when surfaces such as
cones and spheres form the boundary of the region of integration.
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate 
where 
is the unit ball:
SOLUTION Since the boundary of 
is a sphere, we use spherical coordinates:
In addition, spherical coordinates are appropriate because
Thus 
gives

NOTE It would have been extremely awkward to evaluate the integral in Example 3
without spherical coordinates. In rectangular coordinates the iterated integral would

12.8
CHANGE OF VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
In one-dimensional calculus we often use a change of variable (a substitution) to sim-
plify an integral. By reversing the roles of and , we can write the Substitution Rule
(4.5.4) as
where 
and 
, 
. Another way of writing Formula 1 is as 
follows:
A change of variables can also be useful in double integrals. We have already seen
one example of this: conversion to polar coordinates. The new variables 
and 
are
related to the old variables and by the equations
and the change of variables formula (12.3.2) can be written as
where is the region in the 
-plane that corresponds to the region 
in the
-plane.
More generally, we consider a change of variables that is given by a transforma-
tion
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane:
where and are related to 
and by the equations
or, as we sometimes write,
We usually assume that 
is a C transformation, which means that and have con-
tinuous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives.
A transformation 
is really just a function whose domain and range are both sub-
sets of
. If
, then the point
is called the image of the point
. If no two points have the same image, 
is called one-to-one. Figure 1 shows
the effect of a transformation 
on a region 
in the 
-plane. 
transforms 
into a
region 
in the 
-plane called the image of S, consisting of the images of all points

If 
is a one-to-one transformation, then it has an inverse transformation
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane and it may be possible to solve Equations 3 for
and in terms of and :
EXAMPLE 1 A transformation is deﬁned by the equations
Find the image of the square 
, 
.
SOLUTION The transformation maps the boundary of 
into the boundary of the
image. So we begin by ﬁnding the images of the sides of . The ﬁrst side, 
, is
given by 
. (See Figure 2.) From the given equations we have
, 
, and so 
. Thus 
is mapped into the line segment from
to 
in the 
-plane. The second side, 
is 
and, put-
ting 
in the given equations, we get
Eliminating , we obtain
which is part of a parabola. Similarly, 
is given by 
, whose
image is the parabolic arc
Finally, 
is given by 
whose image is 
, 
, that is,
. (Notice that as we move around the square in the counterclockwise
direction, we also move around the parabolic region in the counterclockwise direc-
tion.) The image of 
is the region 
(shown in Figure 2) bounded by the -axis and
the parabolas given by Equations 4 and 5.

Now let’s see how a change of variables affects a double integral. We start with a
small rectangle 
in the 
-plane whose lower left corner is the point 
and
whose dimensions are 
and

This means that we can approximate R by a parallelogram determined by the vec-

DEFINITION The Jacobian of the transformation 
given by
and 
is
With this notation we can use Equation 6 to give an approximation to the area 
of :
where the Jacobian is evaluated at 
.
Next we divide a region 
in the 
-plane into rectangles 
and call their images
in the 
-plane 
. (See Figure 6.)
Applying the approximation 
to each 
we approximate the double integral of
over 
as follows:
where the Jacobian is evaluated at 
. Notice that this double sum is a Riemann
sum for the integral
The foregoing argument suggests that the following theorem is true. (A full proof

■The Jacobian is named after the German
mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi
(1804–1851). Although the French mathe-
matician Cauchy ﬁrst used these special
determinants involving partial derivatives,
Jacobi developed them into a method for
evaluating multiple integrals.

MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

CHANGE OF VARIABLES IN A DOUBLE INTEGRAL Suppose that 
is a
transformation whose Jacobian is nonzero and that maps a region 
in the 
-plane onto a region 
in the 
-plane. Suppose that 
is continuous on
and that 
and 
are type I or type II plane regions. Suppose also that 
is
one-to-one, except perhaps on the boundary of . Then
Theorem 9 says that we change from an integral in and to an integral in 
and
by expressing and in terms of 
and and writing
Notice the similarity between Theorem 9 and the one-dimensional formula in Equa-
tion 2. Instead of the derivative 
, we have the absolute value of the Jacobian, that
is, 
.
As a ﬁrst illustration of Theorem 9, we show that the formula for integration in
polar coordinates is just a special case. Here the transformation 
from the 
-plane
to the 
-plane is given by
and the geometry of the transformation is shown in Figure 7. 
maps an ordinary rect-
angle in the 
-plane to a polar rectangle in the 
-plane. The Jacobian of 
is
Thus Theorem 9 gives
which is the same as Formula 12.3.2.
EXAMPLE 2 Use the change of variables 
, 
to evaluate the 
integral 
, where 
is the region bounded by the -axis and the parabolas
and 
, 
.
SOLUTION The region 
is pictured in Figure 2 (on page 743). In Example 1 we
discovered that

for making the change of variables to evaluate the integral is that 
is a much sim-
pler region than . First we need to compute the Jacobian:
Therefore, by Theorem 9,
■
NOTE Example 2 was not a very difﬁcult problem to solve because we were given
a suitable change of variables. If we are not supplied with a transformation, then the
ﬁrst step is to think of an appropriate change of variables. If 
is difﬁcult to inte-
grate, then the form of 
may suggest a transformation. If the region of integra-
tion 
is awkward, then the transformation should be chosen so that the corresponding
region 
in the 
-plane has a convenient description.
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate the integral 
, where 
is the trapezoidal
region with vertices 
, 
, 
, and 
.
SOLUTION Since it isn’t easy to integrate 
, we make a change of vari-
ables suggested by the form of this function:
These equations deﬁne a transformation 
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane. 
Theorem 9 talks about a transformation 
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane. It is
obtained by solving Equations 10 for and :
The Jacobian of 
is
To ﬁnd the region 
in the 
-plane corresponding to , we note that the sides of

VECTOR CALCULUS
In this chapter we study the calculus of vector fields. (These are functions that assign vectors to points
in space.) In particular we define line integrals (which can be used to find the work done by a force field
in moving an object along a curve). Then we define surface integrals (which can be used to find the rate
of fluid flow across a surface). The connections between these new types of integrals and the single,
double, and triple integrals that we have already met are given by the higher-dimensional versions of
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Green’s Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem.

6:00 PM on March 1, 2010. We see at a glance from the largest arrows that the great-
est wind speeds at that time occurred as the winds entered the bay across the Golden
Gate Bridge. Associated with every point in the air we can imagine a wind velocity
vector. This is an example of a velocity vector ﬁeld. Another example of a velocity
vector ﬁeld is illustrated in Figure 1(b).
Another type of vector ﬁeld, called a force ﬁeld, associates a force vector with each
point in a region. An example is the gravitational force ﬁeld that we will look at in
Example 4.
In general, a vector ﬁeld is a function whose domain is a set of points in 
(or 
)
and whose range is a set of vectors in 
(or 
).
DEFINITION Let 
be a set in 
(a plane region). A vector ﬁeld on 
is
a function 
that assigns to each point 
in 
a two-dimensional vector
.
The best way to picture a vector ﬁeld is to draw the arrow representing the vector
starting at the point 
. Of course, it’s impossible to do this for all points
, but we can gain a reasonable impression of 
by doing it for a few representa-
tive points in 
as in Figure 2. Since 
is a two-dimensional vector, we can write

and 
as follows:
or, for short,
Notice that 
and 
are scalar functions of two variables and are sometimes called
scalar ﬁelds to distinguish them from vector ﬁelds.
DEFINITION Let 
be a subset of 
. A vector ﬁeld on
is a function
that assigns to each point 
in 
a three-dimensional vector 
.
A vector ﬁeld on 
is pictured in Figure 3. We can express it in terms of its com-
ponent functions , , and 
as
As with the vector functions in Section 10.7, we can deﬁne continuity of vector ﬁelds 
and show that 
is continuous if and only if its component functions , , and 
are 
continuous.
We sometimes identify a point 
with its position vector 
and
write 
instead of 
. Then 
becomes a function that assigns a vector
to a vector .
EXAMPLE 1 A vector ﬁeld on 
is deﬁned by 
. Describe
by sketching some of the vectors 
as in Figure 2.
SOLUTION Since 
, we draw the vector 
starting at the point
in Figure 4. Since 
, we draw the vector 
with starting
point 
. Continuing in this way, we calculate several other representative values
of 
in the table and draw the corresponding vectors to represent the vector
ﬁeld in Figure 4.
It appears from Figure 4 that each arrow is tangent to a circle with center the
origin. To conﬁrm this, we take the dot product of the position vector
with the vector 
:
This shows that 
is perpendicular to the position vector 
and is therefore
tangent to a circle with center the origin and radius 
. Notice also that
so the magnitude of the vector 
is equal to the radius of the circle.

Some computer algebra systems are capable of plotting vector ﬁelds in two or three
dimensions. They give a better impression of the vector ﬁeld than is possible by hand
because the computer can plot a large number of representative vectors. Figure 5
shows a computer plot of the vector ﬁeld in Example 1; Figures 6 and 7 show two
other vector ﬁelds. Notice that the computer scales the lengths of the vectors so they
are not too long and yet are proportional to their true lengths.
EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the vector ﬁeld on 
given by 
.
SOLUTION The sketch is shown in Figure 8. Notice that all vectors are vertical and
point upward above the 
-plane or downward below it. The magnitude increases
with the distance from the 
-plane.
■
We were able to draw the vector ﬁeld in Example 2 by hand because of its partic-
ularly simple formula. Most three-dimensional vector ﬁelds, however, are virtually
impossible to sketch by hand and so we need to resort to a computer. Examples are
shown in Figures 9, 10, and 11. Notice that the vector ﬁelds in Figures 9 and 10 have
similar formulas, but all the vectors in Figure 10 point in the general direction of the
negative y-axis because their y-components are all 2. If the vector ﬁeld in Figure 11
represents a velocity ﬁeld, then a particle would be swept upward and would spiral
around the -axis in the clockwise direction as viewed from above.

EXAMPLE 3 Imagine a ﬂuid ﬂowing steadily along a pipe and let 
be the 
velocity vector at a point 
. Then 
assigns a vector to each point 
in a
certain domain 
(the interior of the pipe) and so 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
called a
velocity ﬁeld. A possible velocity ﬁeld is illustrated in Figure 12. The speed at any
given point is indicated by the length of the arrow.
Velocity ﬁelds also occur in other areas of physics. For instance, the vector ﬁeld in
Example 1 could be used as the velocity ﬁeld describing the counterclockwise rota-
tion of a wheel. We have seen other examples of velocity ﬁelds in Figure 1.

EXAMPLE 4 Newton’s Law of Gravitation states that the magnitude of the gravita-
tional force between two objects with masses 
and 
is
where is the distance between the objects and 
is the gravitational constant. (This 
is an example of an inverse square law.) Let’s assume that the object with mass 
is 
located at the origin in 
. (For instance, 
could be the mass of the earth and the
origin would be at its center.) Let the position vector of the object with mass
be
. Then 
, so 
. The gravitational force exerted on this
second object acts toward the origin, and the unit vector in this direction is
Therefore the gravitational force acting on the object at 
is
[Physicists often use the notation instead of 
for the position vector, so you may
see Formula 3 written in the form 
.] The function given by Equa-
tion 3 is an example of a vector ﬁeld, called the gravitational ﬁeld, because it asso-
ciates a vector [the force 
] with every point 
in space (except for the origin).
Formula 3 is a compact way of writing the gravitational ﬁeld, but we can also
write it in terms of its component functions by using the facts that
and 
:
The gravitational ﬁeld 
is pictured in Figure 13.

EXAMPLE 5 Suppose an electric charge 
is located at the origin. According to
Coulomb’s Law, the electric force 
exerted by this charge on a charge 
located
at a point 
with position vector 
is
where 
is a constant (that depends on the units used). For like charges, we have
and the force is repulsive; for unlike charges, we have 
and the force
is attractive. Notice the similarity between Formulas 3 and 4. Both vector ﬁelds are
examples of force ﬁelds.

Instead of considering the electric force , physicists often consider the force per
unit charge:

GRADIENT FIELDS
If 
is a scalar function of two variables, recall from Section 11.6 that its gradient
(or grad ) is deﬁned by
Therefore 
is really a vector ﬁeld on 
and is called a gradient vector ﬁeld. 
Likewise, if is a scalar function of three variables, its gradient is a vector ﬁeld on
given by
EXAMPLE 6 Find the gradient vector ﬁeld of 
. Plot the gradi-
ent vector ﬁeld together with a contour map of f. How are they related?
SOLUTION The gradient vector ﬁeld is given by
Figure 14 shows a contour map of 
with the gradient vector ﬁeld. Notice that the
gradient vectors are perpendicular to the level curves, as we would expect from
Section 11.6. Notice also that the gradient vectors are long where the level curves
are close to each other and short where they are farther apart. That’s because the
length of the gradient vector is the value of the directional derivative of 
and
closely spaced level curves indicate a steep graph.
■
A vector ﬁeld 
is called a conservative vector ﬁeld if it is the gradient of some
scalar function, that is, if there exists a function 
such that 
. In this situation
is called a potential function for .
Not all vector ﬁelds are conservative, but such ﬁelds do arise frequently in physics.
For example, the gravitational ﬁeld F in Example 4 is conservative because if we
deﬁne
then
In Sections 13.3 and 13.5 we will learn how to tell whether or not a given vector ﬁeld
is conservative.

13.2
LINE INTEGRALS
In this section we deﬁne an integral that is similar to a single integral except that
instead of integrating over an interval 
, we integrate over a curve . Such inte-
grals are called line integrals, although “curve integrals” would be better terminology.
They were invented in the early 19th century to solve problems involving ﬂuid ﬂow,
forces, electricity, and magnetism.
We start with a plane curve 
given by the parametric equations
or, equivalently, by the vector equation 
, and we assume that 
is a smooth curve. [This means that 
is continuous and 
. See Section 10.8.]
If we divide the parameter interval 
into n subintervals 
and we let
and 
, then the corresponding points 
divide 
into 
sub-
arcs with lengths 
(See Figure 1.) We choose any point
in the th subarc. (This corresponds to a point 
in 
.) Now if 
is any function
of two variables whose domain includes the curve 
, we evaluate 
at the point
, multiply by the length 
of the subarc, and form the sum
which is similar to a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit of these sums and make
the following deﬁnition by analogy with a single integral.

DEFINITION If 
is deﬁned on a smooth curve 
given by Equations 1,
then the line integral of f along C is
if this limit exists.
In Section 9.2 we found that the length of 
is
A similar type of argument can be used to show that if is a continuous function, then
the limit in Deﬁnition 2 always exists and the following formula can be used to eval-
uate the line integral:
The value of the line integral does not depend on the parametrization of the curve, pro-
vided that the curve is traversed exactly once as t increases from a to b.
If 
is the length of C between 
and 
, then
So the way to remember Formula 3 is to express everything in terms of the parameter
Use the parametric equations to express and in terms of t and write ds as
In the special case where 
is the line segment that joins 
to 
, using as
the parameter, we can write the parametric equations of 
as follows: 
, 
,
. Formula 3 then becomes
and so the line integral reduces to an ordinary single integral in this case.
Just as for an ordinary single integral, we can interpret the line integral of a posi-
tive function as an area. In fact, if 
, 
represents the area of one
side of the “fence” or “curtain” in Figure 2, whose base is 
and whose height above
the point 
is 
.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where 
is the upper half of the unit circle
.
SOLUTION In order to use Formula 3 we ﬁrst need parametric equations to repre-
sent C. Recall that the unit circle can be parametrized by means of the equations

wire is approximately 
. By taking more and more points on the curve,
we obtain the mass
of the wire as the limiting value of these approximations:
[For example, if 
represents the density of a semicircular wire, then
the integral in Example 1 would represent the mass of the wire.] The center of mass
of the wire with density function 
is located at the point 
, where
Other physical interpretations of line integrals will be discussed later in this chapter.
EXAMPLE 3 A wire takes the shape of the semicircle 
, 
, and is
thicker near its base than near the top. Find the center of mass of the wire if the
linear density at any point is proportional to its distance from the line 
.
SOLUTION As in Example 1 we use the parametrization 
, 
,
, and ﬁnd that 
. The linear density is
where is a constant, and so the mass of the wire is
From Equations 4 we have
By symmetry we see that

SECTION 13.2  LINE INTEGRALS

The following formulas say that line integrals with respect to 
and 
can also be 
evaluated by expressing everything in terms of : 
, 
, 
,
.
It frequently happens that line integrals with respect to 
and 
occur together.
When this happens, it’s customary to abbreviate by writing
When we are setting up a line integral, sometimes the most difﬁcult thing is to think
of a parametric representation for a curve whose geometric description is given. In
particular, we often need to parametrize a line segment, so it’s useful to remember that
a vector representation of the line segment that starts at 
and ends at 
is given by
(See Equation 10.5.4.)
EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate 
, where (a) 
is the line segment from
to 
and (b) 
is the arc of the parabola 
from
to 
. (See Figure 7.)
SOLUTION
(a) A parametric representation for the line segment is
(Use Equation 8 with 
and 
.) Then 
, 
,
and Formulas 7 give
(b) Since the parabola is given as a function of , let’s take as the parameter and

Then 
and by Formulas 7 we have
■
Notice that we got different answers in parts (a) and (b) of Example 4 even though
the two curves had the same endpoints. Thus, in general, the value of a line integral
depends not just on the endpoints of the curve but also on the path. (But see Sec-
tion 13.3 for conditions under which the integral is independent of the path.)
Notice also that the answers in Example 4 depend on the direction, or orientation,
of the curve. If 
denotes the line segment from 
to 
, then using the
parametrization
you can verify that
In general, a given parametrization 
, 
, 
, determines an
orientation of a curve , with the positive direction corresponding to increasing values
of the parameter 
(See Figure 8, where the initial point 
corresponds to the param-
eter value 
and the terminal point 
corresponds to 
.)
If 
denotes the curve consisting of the same points as 
but with the opposite
orientation (from initial point 
to terminal point 
in Figure 8), then we have
But if we integrate with respect to arc length, the value of the line integral does not
change when we reverse the orientation of the curve:
This is because 
is always positive, whereas 
and 
change sign when we
reverse the orientation of .
LINE INTEGRALS IN SPACE
We now suppose that 
is a smooth space curve given by the parametric equations
or by a vector equation 
. If 
is a function of three vari-
ables that is continuous on some region containing , then we deﬁne the line integral
of

LINE INTEGRALS OF VECTOR FIELDS
Recall from Section 7.6 that the work done by a variable force 
in moving a 
particle from to along the -axis is 
. Then in Section 10.3 we found
that the work done by a constant force 
in moving an object from a point
to another
point 
in space is 
, where 
l is the displacement vector.
Now suppose that 
is a continuous force ﬁeld on 
, such as
the gravitational ﬁeld of Example 4 in Section 13.1 or the electric force ﬁeld of 
Example 5 in Section 13.1. (A force ﬁeld on 
could be regarded as a special case
where 
and 
and 
depend only on 
and .) We wish to compute the work
done by this force in moving a particle along a smooth curve .
We divide 
into subarcs 
with lengths 
by dividing the parameter inter-
val 
into subintervals. (See Figure 1 for the two-dimensional case or Figure 11
for the three-dimensional case.) Choose a point 
on the th subarc cor-
responding to the parameter value 
. If 
is small, then as the particle moves from
to 
along the curve, it proceeds approximately in the direction of 
, the unit
tangent vector at 
. Thus the work done by the force 
in moving the particle from
to 
is approximately
and the total work done in moving the particle along 
is approximately
where 
is the unit tangent vector at the point 
on . Intuitively, we see
that these approximations ought to become better as the subarcs become shorter.
Therefore we deﬁne the work
done by the force ﬁeld 
as the limit of the Riemann

Equation 12 says that work is the line integral with respect to arc length of the tangen -
tial component of the force.
If the curve 
is given by the vector equation 
, then
, so using Equation 9 we can rewrite Equation 12 in the form
This integral is often abbreviated as 
and occurs in other areas of physics as
well. Therefore we make the following deﬁnition for the line integral of any continu-
ous vector ﬁeld.
DEFINITION Let 
be a continuous vector ﬁeld deﬁned on a smooth curve
given by a vector function 
, 
. Then the line integral of
along C is
When using Deﬁnition 13, remember that 
is just an abbreviation for
, so we evaluate 
simply by putting 
, 
, and
in the expression for

13.3
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM FOR LINE INTEGRALS
Recall from Section 4.4 that Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be
written as
where 
is continuous on 
. We also called Equation 1 the Net Change Theorem:
The integral of a rate of change is the net change.
If we think of the gradient vector 
of a function 
of two or three variables as a
sort of derivative of , then the following theorem can be regarded as a version of the
Funda mental Theorem for line integrals.
THEOREM Let
be a smooth curve given by the vector function
,
. Let 
be a differentiable function of two or three variables whose
gradient vector 
is continuous on . Then
NOTE Theorem 2 says that we can evaluate the line integral of a conservative vec-
tor ﬁeld (the gradient vector ﬁeld of the potential function ) simply by knowing the
value of 
at the endpoints of . In fact, Theorem 2 says that the line integral of
is the net change in f. If 
is a function of two variables and 
is a plane curve with
initial point 
and terminal point 
, as in Figure 1, then Theorem 2
becomes
If is a function of three variables and 
is a space curve joining the point 
to the point 
, then we have

Let’s prove Theorem 2 for this case.
PROOF OF THEOREM 2 Using Deﬁnition 13.2.13, we have
(by the Chain Rule)
The last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Equation 1).
Although we have proved Theorem 2 for smooth curves, it is also true for piecewise-
smooth curves. This can be seen by subdividing 
into a ﬁnite number of smooth
curves and adding the resulting integrals.

INDEPENDENCE OF PATH
Suppose

tion 13.2 that, in general,

that
whenever 
is continuous. In other words, the line integral of a conservative vector
ﬁeld depends only on the initial point and terminal point of a curve.

In general, if 
is a continuous vector ﬁeld with domain 
, we say that the line 
integral 
is independent of path if 
for any two paths
and 
in 
that have the same initial and terminal points. With this terminology
we can say that line integrals of conservative vector ﬁelds are independent of path.
A curve is called closed if its terminal point coincides with its initial point, that is,
. (See Figure 2.) If 
is independent of path in 
and 
is any
closed path in , we can choose any two points 
and 
on 
and regard 
as being
composed of the path 
from 
to 
followed by the path 
from 
to . (See Fig -
ure 3.) Then
since 
and 
have the same initial and terminal points.
Conversely, if it is true that 
whenever 
is a closed path in , then
we demonstrate independence of path as follows. Take any two paths 
and 
from
to 
in 
and deﬁne 
to be the curve consisting of 
followed by 
. Then
and so 
. Thus we have proved the following theorem.
THEOREM
is independent of path in 
if and only if
for every closed path 
in .
Since we know that the line integral of any conservative vector ﬁeld 
is indepen-
dent of path, it follows that 
for any closed path. The physical interpre-
tation is that the work done by a conservative force ﬁeld (such as the gravitational or
electric ﬁeld in Section 13.1) as it moves an object around a closed path is 0.
The following theorem says that the only vector ﬁelds that are independent of path
are conservative. It is stated and proved for plane curves, but there is a similar version
for space curves. We assume that 
is open, which means that for every point 
in
there is a disk with center 
that lies entirely in . (So 
doesn’t contain any of its
boundary points.) In addition, we assume that 
is connected. This means that any
two points in 
can be joined by a path that lies in .
THEOREM Suppose 
is a vector ﬁeld that is continuous on an open con-
nected region . If 
is independent of path in , then 
is a conserva-
tive vector ﬁeld on 
; that is, there exists a function 
such that 
.
PROOF Let 
be a ﬁxed point in . We construct the desired potential func-
tion 
by deﬁning
for any point 
in . Since 
is independent of path, it does not matter 
which path 
from 
to 
is used to evaluate 
. Since 
is open, there

THEOREM If 
is a conservative vector ﬁeld,
where 
and 
have continuous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives on a domain ,
then throughout 
we have
The converse of Theorem 5 is true only for a special type of region. To explain this,
we ﬁrst need the concept of a simple curve, which is a curve that doesn’t intersect
itself anywhere between its endpoints. [See Figure 6; 
for a simple closed
curve, but 
when 
.]
In Theorem 4 we needed an open connected region. For the next theorem we need
a stronger condition. A simply-connected region in the plane is a connected region
such that every simple closed curve in 
encloses only points that are in . Notice
from Figure 7 that, intuitively speaking, a simply-connected region contains no hole
and can’t consist of two separate pieces.
In terms of simply-connected regions we can now state a partial converse to Theo-
rem 5 that gives a convenient method for verifying that a vector ﬁeld on 
is conser-
vative. The proof will be sketched in the next section as a consequence of Green’s
Theorem.

Also, the domain of 
is the entire plane 
, which is open and simply-
connected. Therefore we can apply Theorem 6 and conclude that 
is conservative.
■
In Example 3, Theorem 6 told us that 
is conservative, but it did not tell us how
to ﬁnd the (potential) function 
such that 
. The proof of Theorem 4 gives us
a clue as to how to ﬁnd . We use “partial integration” as in the following example.
EXAMPLE 4
(a) If 
, ﬁnd a function 
such that 
.
(b) Evaluate the line integral 
, where 
is the curve given by
, 
.
SOLUTION
(a) From Example 3 we know that 
is conservative and so there exists a function
with 
, that is,
Integrating 
with respect to , we obtain
Notice that the constant of integration is a constant with respect to , that is, a func-
tion of , which we have called 
. Next we differentiate both sides of 
with
respect to :
Comparing 
and 
, we see that
Integrating with respect to , we have
where 
is a constant. Putting this in 
, we have
as the desired potential function.
(b) To use Theorem 2 all we have to know are the initial and terminal points of ,
namely, 
and 
. In the expression for 
in part (a),
any value of the constant 
will do, so let’s choose 
. Then we have
This method is much shorter than the straightforward method for evaluating line
integrals that we learned in Section 13.2.
■
A criterion for determining whether or not a vector ﬁeld 
on 
is conservative is
given in Section 13.5. Meanwhile, the next example shows that the technique for ﬁnd-
ing the potential function is much the same as for vector ﬁelds on

CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
Let’s apply the ideas of this chapter to a continuous force ﬁeld 
that moves an object
along a path 
given by 
, 
, where 
is the initial point and
is the terminal point of . According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion
(see Sec tion 10.9), the force 
at a point on 
is related to the acceleration
by the equation
So the work done by the force on the object is

Therefore
where 
is the velocity.
The quantity 
, that is, half the mass times the square of the speed, is
called the kinetic energy of the object. Therefore we can rewrite Equation 15 as
which says that the work done by the force ﬁeld along 
is equal to the change in
kinetic energy at the endpoints of .
Now let’s further assume that 
is a conservative force ﬁeld; that is, we can write
. In physics, the potential energy of an object at the point 
is deﬁned
as 
, so we have 
. Then by Theorem 2 we have
Comparing this equation with Equation 16, we see that
which says that if an object moves from one point 
to another point 
under the inﬂu-
ence of a conservative force ﬁeld, then the sum of its potential energy and its kinetic
energy remains constant. This is called the Law of Conservation of Energy and it is
the reason the vector ﬁeld is called conservative.

GREEN’S THEOREM
Green’s Theorem gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed
curve 
and a double integral over the plane region 
bounded by . (See Figure 1.
We assume that 
consists of all points inside 
as well as all points on .) In stating
Green’s Theorem we use the convention that the positive orientation of a simple
closed curve 
refers to a single counterclockwise traversal of . Thus if 
is given
by the vector function 
, 
, then the region 
is always on the left as the
point 
traverses . (See Figure 2.)
GREEN’S THEOREM Let 
be a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple
closed curve in the plane and let 
be the region bounded by . If 
and
have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains , then
NOTE The notation
gC
is sometimes used to indicate that the line integral is calculated using the positive ori-
entation of the closed curve . Another notation for the positively oriented boundary
curve of 
is 
, so the equation in Green’s Theorem can be written as
Green’s Theorem should be regarded as the counterpart of the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus for double integrals. Compare Equation 1 with the statement of the Funda -
mental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, in the following equation:
In both cases there is an integral involving derivatives (
, 
, and 
) on 
the left side of the equation. And in both cases the right side involves the values of 
the original functions ( , , and ) only on the boundary of the domain. (In the one-

whose boundary consists of just two
points, 
and .)
Green’s Theorem is not easy to prove in general, but we can give a proof for the
special case where the region is both of type I and of type II (see Section 12.2). Let’s
call such regions simple regions.
PROOF OF GREEN’S THEOREM FOR THE CASE IN WHICH 
IS A SIMPLE REGION
Notice that Green’s Theorem will be proved if we can show that
and
We prove Equation 2 by expressing 
as a type I region:
where 
and 
are continuous functions. This enables us to compute the double
integral on the right side of Equation 2 as follows:
where the last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Now we compute the left side of Equation 2 by breaking up 
as the union of the
four curves

shown in Figure 3. On

■GREEN
Green’s Theorem is named after the 
self-taught English scientist George Green
(1793–1841). He worked full-time in his
father’s bakery from the age of nine and
taught himself mathematics from library
books. In 1828 he published privately An
Essay on the Application of Mathematical
Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and
Magnetism, but only 100 copies were
printed and most of those went to his
friends. This pamphlet contained a theo-
rem that is equivalent to what we know as
Green’s Theorem, but it didn’t become
widely known at that time. Finally, at age
40, Green entered Cambridge University
as an undergraduate but died four years
after graduation. In 1846 William Thom-
son (Lord Kelvin) located a copy of
Green’s essay, realized its signiﬁcance, and
had it reprinted. Green was the ﬁrst person
to try to formulate a mathematical theory
of electricity and magnetism. His work
was the basis for the subsequent electro-
magnetic theories of Thomson, Stokes,
Rayleigh, and Maxwell.

Comparing this expression with the one in Equation 4, we see that
Equation 3 can be proved in much the same way by expressing 
as a type II region
(see Exercise 30). Then, by adding Equations 2 and 3, we obtain Green’s Theorem.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where 
is the triangular curve consisting
of the line segments from 
to 
, from 
to 
, and from 
to 
.
SOLUTION Although the given line integral could be evaluated as usual by the
methods of Section 13.2, that would involve setting up three separate integrals along
the three sides of the triangle, so let’s use Green’s Theorem instead. Notice that the
region 
enclosed by 
is simple and 
has positive orientation (see Figure 4). If
we let 
and 
, then we have
■
EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate 
, where 
is the
circle 
.
SOLUTION The region 
bounded by 
is the disk 
, so let’s change to
polar coordinates after applying Green’s Theorem:
■
In Examples 1 and 2 we found that the double integral was easier to evaluate than
the line integral. (Try setting up the line integral in Example 2 and you’ll soon be con-
vinced!) But sometimes it’s easier to evaluate the line integral, and Green’s Theorem
is used in the reverse direction. For instance, if it is known that
on the curve , then Green’s Theorem gives
no matter what values 
and 
assume in the region .
Another application of the reverse direction of Green’s Theorem is in computing
areas. Since the area of

There are several possibilities:
Then Green’s Theorem gives the following formulas for the area of

SOLUTION The ellipse has parametric equations 
and

■
Although we have proved Green’s Theorem only for the case where 
is simple,
we can now extend it to the case where 
is a ﬁnite union of simple regions. For exam-
ple, if 
is the region shown in Figure 5, then we can write 
, where
and 
are both simple. The boundary of 
is 
and the boundary of 
is
so, applying Green’s Theorem to 
and 
separately, we get
If we add these two equations, the line integrals along 
and 
cancel, so we get
which is Green’s Theorem for 
, since its boundary is 
.
The same sort of argument allows us to establish Green’s Theorem for any ﬁnite
union of nonoverlapping simple regions (see Figure 6).

annular region

Therefore Green’s Theorem gives
■
Green’s Theorem can be extended to apply to regions with holes, that is, regions
that are not simply-connected. Observe that the boundary 
of the region 
in Fig -
ure 8 consists of two simple closed curves 
and 
. We assume that these boundary
curves are oriented so that the region 
is always on the left as the curve 
is tra-
versed. Thus the positive direction is counterclockwise for the outer curve 
but
clockwise for the inner curve 
. If we divide 
into two regions 
and 
by means
of the lines shown in Figure 9 and then apply Green’s Theorem to each of 
and 
we get
Since the line integrals along the common boundary lines are in opposite directions,
they cancel and we get
which is Green’s Theorem for the region .
EXAMPLE 5 If 
, show that 
for
every positively oriented simple closed path that encloses the origin.
SOLUTION Since 
is an arbitrary closed path that encloses the origin, it’s difﬁcult
to compute the given integral directly. So let’s consider a counterclockwise-oriented
circle 
with center the origin and radius , where 
is chosen to be small enough
that 
lies inside . (See Figure 10.) Let 
be the region bounded by 
and 
.
Then its positively oriented boundary is 
and so the general version of
Green’s Theorem gives

If

Theo rem gives
A curve that is not simple crosses itself at one or more points and can be broken up
into a number of simple curves. We have shown that the line integrals of 
around
these simple curves are all 0 and, adding these integrals, we see that

CURL AND DIVERGENCE
In this section we deﬁne two operations that can be performed on vector ﬁelds and that
play a basic role in the applications of vector calculus to ﬂuid ﬂow and electricity and
magnetism. Each operation resembles differentiation, but one produces a vector ﬁeld
whereas the other produces a scalar ﬁeld.
CURL
If 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
and the partial derivatives of , , and
all exist, then the curl of 
is the vector ﬁeld on 
deﬁned by
As an aid to our memory, let’s rewrite Equation 1 using operator notation. We intro-
duce the vector differential operator 
(“del”) as
It has meaning when it operates on a scalar function to produce the gradient of :
If we think of 
as a vector with components 
, 
, and 
, we can also con-
sider the formal cross product of 
with the vector ﬁeld 
as follows:
Thus the easiest way to remember Deﬁnition 1 is by means of the symbolic expression

Recall that the gradient of a function of three variables is a vector ﬁeld on 
and
so we can compute its curl. The following theorem says that the curl of a gradient vec-
tor ﬁeld is .
THEOREM If is a function of three variables that has continuous second-
order partial derivatives, then
PROOF We have
by Clairaut’s Theorem.
Since a conservative vector ﬁeld is one for which 
, Theorem 3 can be re -
phrased as follows:
If 
is conservative, then 
.
This gives us a way of verifying that a vector ﬁeld is not conservative.
EXAMPLE 2 Show that the vector ﬁeld 
is not
conservative.
SOLUTION In Example 1 we showed that
This shows that 
and so, by Theorem 3, 
is not conservative.

The converse of Theorem 3 is not true in general, but the following theorem says
the converse is true if 
is deﬁned everywhere. (More generally it is true if the domain
is simply-connected, that is, “has no hole.”) Theorem 4 is the three-dimensional ver-
sion of Theorem 13.3.6. Its proof requires Stokes’ Theorem and is sketched at the end
of Section 13.8.
THEOREM If

whose component
functions have continuous partial derivatives and 
, then 
is a con-
servative vector ﬁeld.

Since

Theorem 4.
(b) The technique for ﬁnding 
was given in Section 13.3. We have

The reason for the name curl is that the curl vector is associated with rotations. One
connection is explained in Exercise 35. Another occurs when

ity ﬁeld in ﬂuid ﬂow (see Example 3 in Section 13.1). Particles near (x, y, ) in the ﬂuid

of this curl vector is a measure of how quickly the particles move around the axis (see
Figure 1). If 
at a point , then the ﬂuid is free from rotations at 
and 
is
called irro tational at . In other words, there is no whirlpool or eddy at P. If
, then a tiny paddle wheel moves with the ﬂuid but doesn’t rotate about its
axis. If 
, the paddle wheel rotates about its axis. We give a more detailed
explanation in Section 13.8 as a consequence of Stokes’ Theorem.
DIVERGENCE
If

then the divergence of

Observe that

is a scalar ﬁeld. In terms of the gradient
operator 
, the divergence of can be written sym-
bolically as the dot product of

SOLUTION By the deﬁnition of divergence (Equation 9 or 10) we have
■
If 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
, then 
is also a vector ﬁeld on 
. As such, we can
compute its divergence. The next theorem shows that the result is 0.
THEOREM If

EXAMPLE 5 Show that the vector ﬁeld 
can’t be 
written as the curl of another vector ﬁeld, that is, 
.
SOLUTION In Example 4 we showed that

which contradicts 
. Therefore

■
Again, the reason for the name divergence can be understood in the context of ﬂuid
ﬂow. If 
is the velocity of a ﬂuid (or gas), then 
represents the
net rate of change (with respect to time) of the mass of ﬂuid (or gas) ﬂowing from 
the point 
per unit volume. In other words, 
measures the ten-
dency of the ﬂuid to diverge from the point 
. If 
, then 
is said to be 
incompressible.
Another differential operator occurs when we compute the divergence of a gradi-
ent vector ﬁeld 
. If 
is a function of three variables, we have
and this expression occurs so often that we abbreviate it as 
. The operator
is called the Laplace operator because of its relation to Laplace’s equation
We can also apply the Laplace operator 
to a vector ﬁeld
in terms of its components:
VECTOR FORMS OF GREEN’S THEOREM
The curl and divergence operators allow us to rewrite Green’s Theorem in versions
that will be useful in our later work. We suppose that the plane region , its boundary
curve , and the functions 
and 
satisfy the hypotheses of Green’s Theorem. Then
we consider the vector ﬁeld 
. Its line integral is

13.6
PARAMETRIC SURFACES AND THEIR AREAS
So far we have considered special types of surfaces: cylinders, quadric surfaces,
graphs of functions of two variables, and level surfaces of functions of three variables.
Here we use vector functions to describe more general surfaces, called parametric
surfaces, and compute their areas. Then we take the general surface area formula and
see how it applies to special surfaces.
PARAMETRIC SURFACES
In much the same way that we describe a space curve by a vector function 
of a
single parameter , we can describe a surface by a vector function 
of two param -
 eters 
and . We suppose that
is a vector-valued function deﬁned on a region 
in the 
-plane. So x, y, and , the
component functions of r, are functions of the two variables u and with domain D.
The set of all points 
in 
such that
and 
varies throughout , is called a parametric surface
and Equations 2 are
called parametric equations of . Each choice of u and gives a point on S; by mak-
ing all choices, we get all of S. In other words, the surface is traced out by the tip of
the position vector 
as 
moves throughout the region . (See Figure 1.)
EXAMPLE 1 Identify and sketch the surface with vector equation
SOLUTION The parametric equations for this surface are
So for any point 
on the surface, we have
This means that vertical cross-sections parallel to the 
-plane (that is, with y con-
stant) are all circles with radius 2. Since 
and no restriction is placed on , the
surface is a circular cylinder with radius 2 whose axis is the y-axis (see Figure 2). ■
In Example 1 we placed no restrictions on the parameters u and and so we got the
entire cylinder. If, for instance, we restrict u and by writing the parameter domain as
then 
and we get the quarter-cylinder with length 3 illustrated
in Figure 3.

If a parametric surface S is given by a vector function 
, then there are two
useful families of curves that lie on S, one family with u constant and the other with
constant. These families correspond to vertical and horizontal lines in the 
-plane.
If we keep 
constant by putting 
becomes a vector function of
the single parameter and deﬁnes a curve 
lying on . (See Figure 4.)
Similarly, if we keep 
constant by putting 
given by
that lies on . We call these curves grid curves. (In Example 1, for instance,
the grid curves obtained by letting u be constant are horizontal lines whereas the grid
curves with constant are circles.) In fact, when a computer graphs a parametric sur-
face, it usually depicts the surface by plotting these grid curves, as we see in the fol-
lowing example.
EXAMPLE 2 Use a computer algebra system to graph the surface
Which grid curves have u constant? Which have constant?
SOLUTION We graph the portion of the surface with parameter domain
in Figure 5. It has the appearance of a spiral tube. To
identify the grid curves, we write the corresponding parametric equations:
If is constant, then 
and 
are constant, so the parametric equations 
resemble those of the helix in Example 4 in Section 10.7. So the grid curves with
constant are the spiral curves in Figure 5. We deduce that the grid curves with u
constant must be the curves that look like circles in the ﬁgure. Further evidence for
this assertion is that if u is kept constant, 
, then the equation
shows that the -values vary from 
to 
.
■
In Examples 1 and 2 we were given a vector equation and asked to graph the cor-
responding parametric surface. In the following examples, however, we are given the
more challenging problem of ﬁnding a vector function to represent a given surface. In
the rest of this chapter we will often need to do exactly that.
EXAMPLE 3 Find a vector function that represents the plane that passes through the 
point 
with position vector 
and that contains two nonparallel vectors a and b.

SOLUTION If P is any point in the plane, we can get from 
to 
by moving a
certain distance in the direction of 
and another distance in the direction of . So
there are scalars u and such that A

EXAMPLE 4 Find a parametric representation of the sphere 
.
SOLUTION The sphere has a simple representation 
in spherical coordinates,
so let’s choose the angles 
and 
in spherical coordinates as the parameters (see
Section 12.7). Then, putting 
in the equations for conversion from spherical to
rectangular coordinates (Equations 12.7.1), we obtain
as the parametric equations of the sphere. The corresponding vector equation is
We have 
and 
, so the parameter domain is the rectangle
. The grid curves with 
constant are the circles of constant
latitude (including the equator). The grid curves with
constant are the meridians
(semi circles), which connect the north and south poles (see Figure 7).
■
NOTE We saw in Example 4 that the grid curves for a sphere are curves of con-
stant latitude and longitude. For a general parametric surface we are really making a
map and the grid curves are similar to lines of latitude and longitude. Describing a
point on a parametric surface (like the one in Figure 5) by giving speciﬁc values of
and is like giving the latitude and longitude of a point.

shows the result of trying to graph the

equation for and graphing the top and

and in cylindrical coordinates. Then the para-
metric equations of the cylinder are
where 
and 
.
■
Parametric representations (also called parametrizations) of surfaces are not unique.
The next example shows two ways to parametrize a cone.
EXAMPLE 6 Find a parametric representation for the surface 
, that
is, the top half of the cone 
.
SOLUTION 1 If we regard x and y as parameters, then the parametric equations are
simply
and the vector equation is
SOLUTION 2 Another representation results from choosing as parameters the polar
coordinates r and . A point 
on the cone satisﬁes 
,
,
and 
. So a vector equation for the cone is
where 
and 
.
■
As in the ﬁrst solution of Example 6, a general surface given as the graph of a 
function of 
and , that is, with an equation of the form 
, can always be
regarded as a parametric surface by taking and as parameters and writing the para-
metric equations as
SURFACES OF REVOLUTION
Surfaces of revolution can be represented parametrically and thus graphed using a
computer. For instance, let’s consider the surface 
obtained by rotating the curve
, 
, about the -axis, where 
. Let 
be the angle of rotation
as shown in Figure 10. If 
is a point on , then
Therefore we take and 
as parameters and regard Equations 3 as parametric equa-
tions of . The parameter domain is given by 
, 
.

SOLUTION From Equations 3, the parametric equations are
and the parameter domain is 
, 
. Using a computer to plot
these equations and rotate the image, we obtain the graph in Figure 11.
■
We can adapt Equations 3 to represent a surface obtained through revolution about
the - or -axis. (See Exercise 26.)
TANGENT PLANES
We now ﬁnd the tangent plane to a parametric surface traced out by a vector function
at a point 
with position vector 
. If we keep 
constant by putting 
,
then 
becomes a vector function of the single parameter 
and deﬁnes a grid
curve 
lying on . (See Figure 12.) The tangent vector to 
at 
is obtained by tak-
ing the partial derivative of with respect to :
Similarly, if we keep constant by putting 
, we get a grid curve 
given by
that lies on , and its tangent vector at 
is
If 
is not , then the surface 
is called smooth (it has no “corners”). For a
smooth surface, the tangent plane is the plane that contains the tangent vectors 
and
, and the vector 
is a normal vector to the tangent plane.

Thus a normal vector to the tangent plane is
Notice that the point 
corresponds to the parameter values 
and

so the normal vector there is
Therefore an equation of the tangent plane at

■
SURFACE AREA
Now we deﬁne the surface area of a general parametric surface given by Equation 1.
For simplicity we start by considering a surface whose parameter domain 
is a rect-
angle, and we divide it into subrectangles 
. Let’s choose 
to be the lower left
corner of 
. (See Figure 14.) 
The part 
of the surface that corresponds to 
is called a patch and has the point
with position vector 
as one of its corners. Let
be the tangent vectors at 
as given by Equations 5 and 4.
Figure 15(a) shows how the two edges of the patch that meet at 
can be approx-
imated by vectors. These vectors, in turn, can be approximated by the vectors
and 
because partial derivatives can be approximated by difference quotients. So
we approximate 
by the parallelogram determined by the vectors 
and 
.
This parallelogram is shown in Figure 15(b) and lies in the tangent plane to 
at 
.
The area of this parallelogram is
and so an approximation to the area of 
is
Our intuition tells us that this approximation gets better as we increase the number of
subrectangles and their dimensions decrease, and we recognize the double sum as a
Riemann sum for the double integral 
. This motivates the following
deﬁnition.

SURFACE INTEGRALS
The relationship between surface integrals and surface area is much the same as the
relationship between line integrals and arc length. Suppose
is a function of three
variables whose domain includes a surface . We will deﬁne the surface integral of

in such a way that, in the case where 
, the value of the surface
integral is equal to the surface area of . We start with parametric surfaces and then
deal with the special case where 
is the graph of a function of two variables.
PARAMETRIC SURFACES
Suppose that a surface 
has a vector equation
We ﬁrst assume that the parameter domain 
is a rectangle and we divide it into sub-
rectangles 
with dimensions 
and 
. Then the surface 
is divided into corre-
sponding patches 
as in Figure 1. We evaluate at a point 
in each patch, multiply
by the area 
of the patch, and form the Riemann sum
Then we take the limit as the number of patches increases (and their dimensions

Notice the analogy with the deﬁnition of a line integral (13.2.2) and also the analogy
with the deﬁnition of a double integral (12.1.5).
To evaluate the surface integral in Equation 1 we approximate the patch area
by the area of an approximating parallelogram in the tangent plane. In our discussion
of surface area in Section 13.6 we made the approximation

a surface

, then
the total mass of the sheet is

ORIENTED SURFACES
To deﬁne surface integrals of vector ﬁelds, we need to rule out nonorientable surfaces
such as the Möbius strip shown in Figure 4. [It is named after the German geometer
August Möbius (1790–1868).] You can construct one for yourself by taking a long
rectangular strip of paper, giving it a half-twist, and taping the short edges together as
in Fig ure 5. If an ant were to crawl along the Möbius strip starting at a point , it
would end up on the “other side” of the strip (that is, with its upper side pointing in
the opposite direction). Then, if the ant continued to crawl in the same direction, 
it would end up back at the same point 
without ever having crossed an edge. (If 
you have constructed a Möbius strip, try drawing a pencil line down the middle.)
Therefore a Möbius strip really has only one side. You can graph the Möbius strip
using the parametric equations in Exercise 28 in Section 13.6.

From now on we consider only orientable (two-sided) surfaces. We start with a sur-
face 
that has a tangent plane at every point 
on 
(except at any boundary
point). There are two unit normal vectors 
and 
at 
. (See Figure 6.) 
If it is possible to choose a unit normal vector 
at every such point 
so that
varies con tinuously over , then is called an oriented surface and the given choice
of 
provides 
with an orientation. There are two possible orientations for any ori-
entable surface (see Figure 7).
For a surface 
given as the graph of , we use Equation 3 to associate
with the surface a natural orientation given by the unit normal vector
Since the -component is positive, this gives the upward orientation of the surface.
If 
is a smooth orientable surface given in parametric form by a vector function 
, then it is automatically supplied with the orientation of the unit normal vector
and the opposite orientation is given by 
. For instance, in Example 4 in Sec -
tion 13.6 we found the parametric representation
for the sphere 
. Then in Example 9 in Section 13.6 we found that
and
So the orientation induced by 
is deﬁned by the unit normal vector
Observe that 
points in the same direction as the position vector, that is, outward
from the sphere (see Figure 8). The opposite (inward) orientation would have been
obtained (see Figure 9) if we had reversed the order of the parameters because
.
For a closed surface, that is, a surface that is the boundary of a solid region , the 
convention is that the positive orientation is the one for which the normal vectors
point outward from , and inward-pointing normals give the negative orientation (see
Figures 8 and 9).

SURFACE INTEGRALS OF VECTOR FIELDS
Suppose that 
is an oriented surface with unit normal vector , and imagine a ﬂuid
with density 
and velocity ﬁeld 
ﬂowing through . (Think of 
as 
an imaginary surface that doesn’t impede the ﬂuid ﬂow, like a ﬁshing net across a
stream.) Then the rate of ﬂow (mass per unit time) per unit area is 
. If we divide
into small patches 
, as in Figure 10 (compare with Figure 1), then 
is nearly pla-
nar and so we can approximate the mass of ﬂuid crossing 
in the direction of the
normal 
per unit time by the quantity
where , , and are evaluated at some point on 
. (Recall that the component of the
vector 
in the direction of the unit vector 
is 
.) By summing these quantities
and taking the limit we get, according to Deﬁnition 1, the surface integral of the func-
tion 
over :
and this is interpreted physically as the rate of ﬂow through .
If we write 
, then 
is also a vector ﬁeld on 
and the integral in Equation 7
becomes
A surface integral of this form occurs frequently in physics, even when 
is not 
,
and is called the surface integral (or ﬂux integral) of 
over .
DEFINITION If 
is a continuous vector ﬁeld deﬁned on an oriented sur-
face 
with unit normal vector , then the surface integral of 
over S is
This integral is also called the ﬂux of 
across .
In words, Deﬁnition 8 says that the surface integral of a vector ﬁeld over is equal
to the surface integral of its normal component over 
(as previously deﬁned).
If 
is given by a vector function 
, then 
is given by Equation 6, and from
Deﬁnition 8 and Equation 2 we have
where

EXAMPLE 4 Find the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld 
across the
unit sphere 
.
SOLUTION As in Example 1, we use the parametric representation
Then
and, from Example 9 in Section 13.6,
Therefore
and, by Formula 9, the ﬂux is
by the same calculation as in Example 1.
■
If, for instance, the vector ﬁeld in Example 4 is a velocity ﬁeld describing the ﬂow
of a ﬂuid with density 1, then the answer, 
, represents the rate of ﬂow through the
unit sphere in units of mass per unit time.
In the case of a surface 
given by a graph 
, we can think of and as
parameters and use Equation 3 to write
Thus Formula 9 becomes
This formula assumes the upward orientation of ; for a downward orientation we
multiply by 
. Similar formulas can be worked out if 
is given by 
or

SOLUTION
consists of a parabolic top surface 
and a circular bottom surface 
.
(See Figure 12.) Since 
is a closed surface, we use the convention of positive 
(outward) orientation. This means that 
is oriented upward and we can use Equa-
tion 10 with 
being the projection of 
on the 
-plane, namely, the disk
. Since
on 
and
we have
The disk 
is oriented downward, so its unit normal vector is 
and we have
since 
on 
. Finally, we compute, by deﬁnition, 
as the sum of the
surface integrals of 
over the pieces 
and 
:
■
Although we motivated the surface integral of a vector ﬁeld using the example of
ﬂuid ﬂow, this concept also arises in other physical situations. For instance, if 
is an
electric ﬁeld (see Example 5 in Section 13.1), then the surface integral
is called the electric ﬂux of 
through the surface . One of the important laws of
electrostatics is Gauss’s Law, which says that the net charge enclosed by a closed sur-
face 
is
where 
is a constant (called the permittivity of free space) that depends on the units
used. (In the SI system, 
.) Therefore, if the vector ﬁeld
in Example 4 represents an electric ﬁeld, we can conclude that the charge enclosed
by 
is 
.
Another application of surface integrals occurs in the study of heat ﬂow. Suppose
the temperature at a point 
in a body is 
. Then the heat ﬂow is deﬁned

where 
is an experimentally determined constant called the conductivity of the sub-
stance. The rate of heat ﬂow across the surface in the body is then given by the sur-
face integral
EXAMPLE 6 The temperature 
in a metal ball is proportional to the square of
the distance from the center of the ball. Find the rate of heat ﬂow across a sphere
of radius 
with center at the center of the ball.
SOLUTION Taking the center of the ball to be at the origin, we have
where 
is the proportionality constant. Then the heat ﬂow is
where 
is the conductivity of the metal. Instead of using the usual parametrization
of the sphere as in Example 4, we observe that the outward unit normal to the
sphere

But on

STOKES’ THEOREM
Stokes’ Theorem can be regarded as a higher-dimensional version of Green’s Theo -
rem. Whereas Green’s Theorem relates a double integral over a plane region 
to a
line integral around its plane boundary curve, Stokes’ Theorem relates a surface inte-
gral over a surface to a line integral around the boundary curve of (which is a space
curve). Figure 1 shows an oriented surface with unit normal vector . The orientation
of 
induces the positive orientation of the boundary curve C shown in the ﬁgure.
This means that if you walk in the positive direction around 
with your head point-
ing in the direction of , then the surface will always be on your left.
STOKES’ THEOREM Let 
be an oriented piecewise-smooth surface that is
bounded by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve 
with posi-
tive orientation. Let 
be a vector ﬁeld whose components have continuous
partial derivatives on an open region in 
that contains . Then

Stokes’ Theorem says that the line integral around the boundary curve of of the tan-
gential component of 
is equal to the surface integral of the normal component of the
curl of .
The positively oriented boundary curve of the oriented surface is often written as 
, so Stokes’ Theorem can be expressed as
There is an analogy among Stokes’ Theorem, Green’s Theorem, and the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus. As before, there is an integral involving derivatives on the left
side of Equation 1 (recall that 
is a sort of derivative of ) and the right side
involves the values of 
only on the boundary of .
In fact, in the special case where the surface 
is ﬂat and lies in the 
-plane with
upward orientation, the unit normal is , the surface integral becomes a double inte-
gral, and Stokes’ Theorem becomes
This is precisely the vector form of Green’s Theorem given in Equation 13.5.12. Thus
we see that Green’s Theorem is really a special case of Stokes’ Theorem.
Although Stokes’ Theorem is too difﬁcult for us to prove in its full generality, we
can give a proof when 
is a graph and , , and 
are well behaved.
PROOF OF A SPECIAL CASE OF STOKES’ THEOREM We assume that the equa-
tion of 
is 
, where has continuous second-order partial
derivatives and 
is a simple plane region whose boundary curve 
corresponds 
to . If the orientation of 
is upward, then the positive orientation of 
corre-
sponds to the positive orientation of 
. (See Figure 2.) We are also given that
, where the partial derivatives of , , and 
are continuous.
Since 
is a graph of a function, we can apply Formula 13.7.10 with 
replaced 
by 
. The result is
where the partial derivatives of , , and

■STOKES
Stokes’ Theorem is named after the Irish
mathematical physicist Sir George Stokes
(1819–1903). Stokes was a professor at
Cambridge University (in fact he held the
same position as Newton, Lucasian Profes-
sor of Mathematics) and was especially
noted for his studies of ﬂuid ﬂow and
light. What we call Stokes’ Theorem was
actually discovered by the Scottish physi-
cist Sir William Thomson (1824–1907,
known as Lord Kelvin). Stokes learned of
this theorem in a letter from Thomson in
1850 and asked students to prove it on an
examination at Cambridge University in
1854. We don’t know if any of those stu-
dents was able to do so.

This allows us, with the aid of the Chain Rule, to evaluate the line integral as follows:
where we have used Green’s Theorem in the last step. Then, using the Chain Rule
again and remembering that , , and 
are functions of , , and and that is
itself a function of and , we get
Four of the terms in this double integral cancel and the remaining six terms can be
arranged to coincide with the right side of Equation 2. Therefore

SOLUTION The curve 
(an ellipse) is shown in Figure 3. Although
could be evaluated directly, it’s easier to use Stokes’ Theorem. We ﬁrst compute
Although there are many surfaces with boundary C, the most convenient choice 
is the elliptical region S in the plane 
that is bounded by . If we 
orient 
upward, then

of

Also, we have
Therefore, by Stokes’ Theorem,
■
Note that in Example 2 we computed a surface integral simply by knowing the val-
ues of 
on the boundary curve . This means that if we have another oriented surface
with the same boundary curve , then we get exactly the same value for the surface
integral!
In general, if 
and 
are oriented surfaces with the same oriented boundary curve
and both satisfy the hypotheses of Stokes’ Theorem, then
This fact is useful when it is difﬁcult to integrate over one surface but easy to integrate
over the other.
We now use Stokes’ Theorem to throw some light on the meaning of the curl vec-
tor. Suppose that 
is an oriented closed curve and 
represents the velocity ﬁeld in
ﬂuid ﬂow. Consider the line integral
and recall that 
is the component of 
in the direction of the unit tangent vector
. This means that the closer the direction of 
is to the direction of , the larger the
value of 
. Thus 
is a measure of the tendency of the ﬂuid to move around
and is called the circulation of 
around . (See Figure 5.)
Now let 
be a point in the ﬂuid and let 
be a small disk with radius
and center 
Then (

This approximation becomes better as

Equation 4 gives the relationship between the curl and the circulation. It shows that
is a measure of the rotating effect of the ﬂuid about the axis n. The curling
effect is greatest about the axis parallel to

Finally, we mention that Stokes’ Theorem can be used to prove Theorem 13.5.4
(which states that if

pre vious work (Theorems 13.3.3 and 13.3.4), we know that

for every closed path . Given , suppose we can ﬁnd an orientable sur-
face whose boundary is . (This can be done, but the proof requires advanced tech-
niques.) Then Stokes’ Theorem gives
A curve that is not simple can be broken into a number of simple curves, and the 
integrals around these simple curves are all 0. Adding these integrals, we obtain
for any closed curve .

in this case) over a region to the integral of the original
function 
over the boundary of the region.
At this stage you may wish to review the various types of regions over which we
were able to evaluate triple integrals in Section 12.5. We state and prove the Diver -
gence Theorem for regions 
that are simultaneously of types 1, 2, and 3 and we call
such regions simple solid regions. (For instance, regions bounded by ellipsoids or
rectangular boxes are simple solid regions.) The boundary of 
is a closed surface, and
we use the convention, introduced in Section 13.7, that the positive orientation is out-
ward; that is, the unit normal vector 
is directed outward from .

■The Divergence Theorem is sometimes
called Gauss’s Theorem after the great 
German mathematician Karl Friedrich
Gauss (1777–1855), who discovered 
this theorem during his investigation of
electrostatics. In Eastern Europe the 
Divergence Theorem is known as Ostro-
gradsky’s Theorem after the Russian
mathe matician Mikhail Ostrogradsky
(1801–1862), who published this result 
in 1826.

To prove Equation 4 we use the fact that 
is a type 1 region:
where 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane. By Equation 12.5.6, we have
and therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
The boundary surface 
consists of three pieces: the bottom surface 
, the top
surface 
, and possibly a vertical surface 
, which lies above the boundary curve
of D. (See Figure 1. It might happen that 
doesn’t appear, as in the case of a
sphere.) Notice that on 
we have 
, because k is vertical and n is horizon-
tal, and so
Thus, regardless of whether there is a vertical surface, we can write
The equation of 
is 
, 
, and the outward normal 
points
upward, so from Equation 13.7.10 (with 
replaced by 
) we have
On 
we have 
, but here the outward normal 
points downward, so 
we multiply by 
:
Therefore Equation 6 gives
Comparison with Equation 5 shows that
Equations 2 and 3 are proved in a similar manner using the expressions for 
as a
type 2 or type 3 region, respectively.

EXAMPLE 1 Find the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld 
over
the unit sphere 
.
SOLUTION First we compute the divergence of :
The unit sphere 
is the boundary of the unit ball 
given by 
.
Thus the Divergence Theorem gives the ﬂux as

EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate 
, where
and 
is the surface of the region 
bounded by the parabolic cylinder
and the planes 
, 
, and 
. (See Figure 2.)
SOLUTION It would be extremely difﬁcult to evaluate the given surface integral
directly. (We would have to evaluate four surface integrals corresponding to the four
pieces of .) Furthermore, the divergence of 
is much less complicated than
itself:
Therefore we use the Divergence Theorem to transform the given surface integral
into a triple integral. The easiest way to evaluate the triple integral is to express 
as
a type 3 region:
Then we have
■
Although we have proved the Divergence Theorem only for simple solid regions,
it can be proved for regions that are ﬁnite unions of simple solid regions. (The proce-
dure is similar to the one we used in Section 13.4 to extend Green’s Theorem.)
For example, let’s consider the region
that lies between the closed surfaces
and
, where 
lies inside 
. Let 
and 
be outward normals of 
and 
. Then the
boundary surface of

on 
(See Figure 3.) Applying the Divergence Theorem to , we get
EXAMPLE 3 In Example 5 in Section 13.1 we considered the electric ﬁeld
where the electric charge 
is located at the origin and 
is a position
vector. Use the Divergence Theorem to show that the electric flux of 
through any
closed surface 
that encloses the origin is
SOLUTION The difficulty is that we don’t have an explicit equation for 
because
it is any closed surface enclosing the origin. The simplest such surface would be a
sphere, so we let 
be a small sphere with radius 
and center the origin. You can
verify that 
. (See Exercise 23.) Therefore Equation 7 gives
The point of this calculation is that we can compute the surface integral over
because 
is a sphere. The normal vector at 
is 
. Therefore
since the equation of 
is 
. Thus we have
This shows that the electric flux of 
is 
through any closed surface 
that
contains the origin. [This is a special case of Gauss’s Law (Equation 13.7.11) for a
single charge. The relationship between 
and 
is 
.]
■
Another application of the Divergence Theorem occurs in ﬂuid ﬂow. Let
be the velocity ﬁeld of a ﬂuid with constant density . Then 
is the rate of ﬂow
per unit area. If 
is a point in the ﬂuid and 
is a ball with center 
and
very small radius , then 
for all points in

is con-
tinuous. We approximate the ﬂux over the boundary sphere

This approximation becomes better as 
and suggests that
Equation 8 says that 
is the net rate of outward ﬂux per unit volume at 
.
(This is the reason for the name divergence.) If 
, the net ﬂow is outward
near 
and 
is called a source. If 
, the net ﬂow is inward near 
and
is called a sink.
For the vector ﬁeld in Figure 4, it appears that the vectors that end near 
are 
shorter than the vectors that start near 
Thus the net ﬂow is outward near 
so
and 
is a source. Near 
on the other hand, the incoming arrows 
are longer than the outgoing arrows. Here the net ﬂow is inward, so 
and 
is a sink. We can use the formula for F to conﬁrm this impression. Since
, we have 
, which is positive when 
. So the
points above the line 
are sources and those below are sinks.
SUMMARY
The main results of this chapter are all higher-dimensional versions of the Funda -
mental Theorem of Calculus. To help you remember them, we collect them together
here (without hypotheses) so that you can see more easily their essential similarity.
Notice that in each case we have an integral of a “derivative” over a region on the left
side, and the right side involves the values of the original function only on the bound-
ary of the region.

TRIGONOMETRY
ANGLES
Angles can be measured in degrees or in radians (abbreviated as rad). The angle given
by a complete revolution contains 
, which is the same as 
rad. Therefore
and
EXAMPLE 1
(a) Find the radian measure of 
.
(b) Express 
rad in degrees.
SOLUTION
(a) From Equation 1 or 2 we see that to convert from degrees to radians we multi-
ply by 
. Therefore
(b) To convert from radians to degrees we multiply by 
. Thus
■
In calculus we use radians to measure angles except when otherwise indicated. The
following table gives the correspondence between degree and radian measures of
some common angles.
Figure 1 shows a sector of a circle with central angle and radius subtending an
arc with length . Since the length of the arc is proportional to the size of the angle,
and since the entire circle has circumference 
and central angle 
, we have
Solving this equation for 
and for , we obtain
Remember that Equations 3 are valid only when 
is measured in radians.
In particular, putting 
in Equation 3, we see that an angle of 1 rad is the angle
subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle
(see Figure 2).

EXAMPLE 2
(a) If the radius of a circle is 5 cm, what angle is subtended by an arc of 6 cm?
(b) If a circle has radius 3 cm, what is the length of an arc subtended by a central
angle of 
rad?
SOLUTION
(a) Using Equation 3 with 
and 
, we see that the angle is
(b) With 
cm and 
rad, the arc length is
■
The standard position of an angle occurs when we place its vertex at the origin of
a coordinate system and its initial side on the positive -axis as in Figure 3. A posi-
tive angle is obtained by rotating the initial side counterclockwise until it coincides
with the terminal side. Likewise, negative angles are obtained by clockwise rotation
as in Figure 4. 
Figure 5 shows several examples of angles in standard position. Notice that differ-
ent angles can have the same terminal side. For instance, the angles 
, 
,
and 
have the same initial and terminal sides because
and 
rad represents a complete revolution.
THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
For an acute angle 
the six trigonometric functions are deﬁned as ratios of lengths of
sides of a right triangle as follows (see Figure 6).
This deﬁnition doesn’t apply to obtuse or negative angles, so for a general angle
in standard position we let 
be any point on the terminal side of 
and we let

TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES
A trigonometric identity is a relationship among the trigonometric functions. The
most elementary are the following, which are immediate consequences of the deﬁni-
tions of the trigonometric functions.
For the next identity we refer back to Figure 7. The distance formula (or, equiva-
lently, the Pythagorean Theorem) tells us that

We have therefore proved one of the most useful of all trigonometric identities:
If we now divide both sides of Equation 7 by 
and use Equations 6, we get
Similarly, if we divide both sides of Equation 7 by 
, we get
The identities
show that 
is an odd function and 
is an even function. They are easily proved
by drawing a diagram showing 
and 
in standard position (see Exercise 39).
Since the angles 
and 
have the same terminal side, we have
These identities show that the sine and cosine functions are periodic with period 
.
The remaining trigonometric identities are all consequences of two basic identities
called the addition formulas:
The proofs of these addition formulas are outlined in Exercises 85, 86, and 87.
By substituting 
for 
in Equations 12a and 12b and using Equations 10a and
10b, we obtain the following subtraction formulas:
Then, by dividing the formulas in Equations 12 or Equations 13, we obtain the cor-

Then, by using the identity 
, we obtain the following alternate
forms of the double-angle formulas for

If we now solve these equations for

formulas, which are useful in integral calculus:
Finally, we state the product formulas, which can be deduced from Equations 12 
and 13:
There are many other trigonometric identities, but those we have stated are the ones

GRAPHS OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
The graph of the function 
, shown in Figure 13(a), is obtained by plotting
points for 
and then using the periodic nature of the function (from Equa -
tion 11) to complete the graph. Notice that the zeros of the sine function occur at the
integer multiples of , that is,
Because of the identity
(which can be veriﬁed using Equation 12a), the graph of cosine is obtained by shift-
ing the graph of sine by an amount 
to the left [see Figure 13(b)]. Note that for
both the sine and cosine functions the domain is 
and the range is the closed
interval 
. Thus, for all values of , we have
The graphs of the remaining four trigonometric functions are shown in Figure 14
and their domains are indicated there. Notice that tangent and cotangent have range
, whereas cosecant and secant have range 
. All four func-
tions are periodic: tangent and cotangent have period , whereas cosecant and secant
have period 
.

SIGMA NOTATION
A convenient way of writing sums uses the Greek letter 
(capital sigma, correspond-
ing to our letter S) and is called sigma notation.
DEFINITION If 
are real numbers and 
and 
are integers
such that 
then
With function notation, Deﬁnition 1 can be written as
Thus the symbol 
indicates a summation in which the letter (called the index of
summation) takes on consecutive integer values beginning with m and ending with n,
that is, 
. Other letters can also be used as the index of summation.

The following theorem gives three simple rules for working with sigma notation.
THEOREM If is any constant (that is, it does not depend on ), then
(a)
(b) 
(c)
PROOF To see why these rules are true, all we have to do is write both sides in
expanded form. Rule (a) is just the distributive property of real numbers:
Rule (b) follows from the associative and commutative properties:
Rule (c) is proved similarly.

EXAMPLE 4 Prove the formula for the sum of the ﬁrst 
positive integers:
SOLUTION This formula can be proved by mathematical induction (see page A12)
or by the following method used by the German mathematician Karl Friedrich
Gauss (1777–1855) when he was ten years old.
Write the sum

PROOFS
In this appendix we present proofs of several theorems that are stated in the main body
of the text. The sections in which they occur are indicated in the margin.
SECTION 1.4
We start by proving the Triangle Inequality, which is an important property of absolute
value.
THE TRIANGLE INEQUALITY If 
and 
are any real numbers, then
Observe that if the numbers and are both positive or both negative, then the two
sides in the Triangle Inequality are actually equal. But if and have opposite signs,
the left side involves a subtraction and the right side does not. This makes the Tri angle
Inequality seem reasonable, but we can prove it as follows.
PROOF Notice that
is always true because 
equals either 
or 
. The corresponding statement for
is
Adding these inequalities, we get
If we now use the fact that 
(with replaced by 
and
by 
), we obtain
which is what we wanted to show.

Therefore
The proofs are similar for the remaining four orderings of , , and .
SECTION 5.1
THEOREM If 
is a one-to-one continuous function deﬁned on an interval
, then its inverse function 
is also continuous.
PROOF First we show that if 
is both one-to-one and continuous on 
, then it
must be either increasing or decreasing on 
. If it were neither increasing nor
decreasing, then there would exist numbers 
, 
, and 
in 
with
such that 
does not lie between 
and 
. There are two possibilities:
either (1) 
lies between 
and 
or (2) 
lies between 
and
. (Draw a picture.) In case (1) we apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to the
continuous function 
to get a number between 
and 
such that 
.
In case (2) the Intermediate Value Theorem gives a number between 
and 
such
that 
. In either case we have contradicted the fact that 
is one-to-one.
Let us assume, for the sake of deﬁniteness, that 
is increasing on 
. We take
any number 
in the domain of 
and we let 
; that is, 
is the num-
ber in 
such that 
. To show that 
is continuous at 
we take any
such that the interval 
is contained in the interval 
.
Since 
is increasing, it maps the numbers in the interval 
onto the
numbers in the interval 
and 
reverses the correspon-
dence. If we let 
denote the smaller of the numbers 
and
, then the interval 
is contained in the interval
and so is mapped into the interval 
by 
.
(See the arrow diagram in Figure 2.) We have therefore found a number 
such
that
This shows that 
and so 
is continuous at any number
in its domain.
SECTION 5.8
In order to give the promised proof of l’Hospital’s Rule we ﬁrst need a generalization
of the Mean Value Theorem. The following theorem is named after the French math-
ematician, Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857).

SECTION 8.5
In order to prove Theorem 8.5.3 we ﬁrst need the following results.
THEOREM
1. If a power series 
converges when 
(where 
), then it
converges whenever 
.
2. If a power series 
diverges when 
(where 
), then it
diverges whenever 
.
PROOF OF 1 Suppose that 
converges. Then, by Theorem 8.2.6, we have
. According to Deﬁnition 8.1.2 with 
, there is a positive 
integer 
such that 
whenever 
. Thus for 
we have
If 
, then 
, so 
is a convergent geometric series. Therefore,
by the Comparison Test, the series 
is convergent. Thus the series 
is absolutely convergent and therefore convergent.

PROOF OF 2 Suppose that 
diverges. If is any number such that 
,
then 
cannot converge because, by part 1, the convergence of 
would
imply the convergence of 
. Therefore 
diverges whenever 
.
THEOREM For a power series 
there are only three possibilities:
1. The series converges only when 
.
2. The series converges for all .
3. There is a positive number 
such that the series converges if 
and
diverges if 
.
PROOF Suppose that neither case 1 nor case 2 is true. Then there are nonzero num-
bers and 
such that 
converges for 
and diverges for 
. Therefore
the set 
is not empty. By the preceding theorem, the series
diverges if 
, so 
for all 
. This says that 
is an upper
bound for the set . Thus, by the Completeness Axiom (see Section 8.1), 
has a
least upper bound . If 
, then 
, so 
diverges. If 
, then
is not an upper bound for 
and so there exists 
such that 
. Since
, 
converges, so by the preceding theorem 
converges.
THEOREM For a power series 
there are only three possibilities:
1. The series converges only when 
.
2. The series converges for all .
3. There is a positive number 
such that the series converges if
and diverges if 
.
PROOF If we make the change of variable 
, then the power series
becomes 
and we can apply the preceding theorem to this series. In case 3 we
have convergence for 
and divergence for 
. Thus we have conver-
gence for 
and divergence for 
.

By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number between

Applying the Mean Value Theorem again, this time to

Combining these equations, we obtain

Applying this theorem a second time, we have
(by Clairaut’s Theorem)
If we complete the square in this expression, we obtain
We are given that

The function values approach 0 as x, y become large; as
approaches the origin, f approaches 
or 0, depending on the
direction of approach.
55. If 
, the graph is a cylindrical surface. For 
, the
level curves are ellipses. The graph curves upward as we leave
the origin, and the steepness increases as c increases. For 
,
the level curves are hyperbolas. The graph curves upward in the
y-direction and downward, approaching the xy-plane, in the 
x-direction giving a saddle-shaped appearance near (0, 0, 1).
