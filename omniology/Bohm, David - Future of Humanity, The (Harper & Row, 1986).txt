PREFACE 
The two dialogues which appear in this book took place 
three years after a series of thirteen similar dialogues 
between Krishnamurti and myself, which appeared in 
the book "The Ending of Time."* Therefore they were 
inevitably profoundly affected by what had been done 
in these earlier dialogues. In a certain sense, therefore, 
the two books deal with closely related questions. Of 
course, "The Ending of Time" can, because of its much 
greater length, go into these questions in a more thor­
ough and extensive way. Nevertheless, the present 
book stands by itself; it approaches the problems of hu­
man life in its own way, and provides important addi­
tional insights into these problems. Moreover, I feel 
that it is an easier book to follow, and may therefore 
usefully serve as an introduction to "The Ending of 
Time." 
The starting point for our discussions was the ques­
tion: "What is the future of humanity?" This question is 
by now of vital concern to everyone, because modern 
science and technology are clearly seen to have opened 
up immense possibilities of destruction. It soon became 
clear as we talked together that the ultimate origin of this 
*Harper & Row, 1985. 

situation is in the generally confused mentality of man­
kind, which has not changed basically in this respect 
throughout the whole of recorded history and probably 
for much longer than this. Evidently, it was essential to 
inquire deeply into the root of this difficulty if there is 
ever to be a possibility that humanity will be diverted 
from its present very dangerous course. 
These dialogues constitute a serious inquiry into this 
problem, and as they proceeded, many of the basic 
points of Krishnamurti's teachings emerged. Thus, the 
question of the future of humanity seems, at first sight, 
to imply that a solution must involve time in a funda­
mental way. Yet, as Krishnamurti points out, psycholog­
ical time, or "becoming," is the very source of the de­
structive current that is putting the future of humanity 
at risk. To question time in this way, however, is to 
question the adequacy of knowledge and thought, as a 
means of dealing with this problem. But if knowledge 
and thought are not adequate, what is it that is actually 
required? This led in turn to the question of whether 
mind is limited by the brain of mankind, with all the 
knowledge that it has accumulated over the ages. This 
knowledge, which now conditions us deeply, has pro­
duced what is, in effect, an irrational and self-destruc­
tive program in which the brain seems to be helplessly 
caught up. 
If mind is limited by such a state of the brain, then the 
future of humanity must be very grim indeed. Krish­
namurti does not, however, regard these limitations as 
inevitable. Rather, he emphasizes that mind is essentially 
free of the distorting bias that is inherent in the condi-
2 

tioning of the brain, and that through insight arising in 
proper undirected attention without a center, it can 
change the cells of the brain and remove the destructive 
conditioning. If this is so, then it is crucially important 
that there be this kind of attention, and that we give to 
this question the same intensity of energy that we gener­
ally give to other activities of life that are really of vital 
interest to us. 
At this point, it is worth remarking that modern re­
search into the brain and nervous system actually gives 
considerable support to Krishnamurti's statement that 
insight may change the brain cells. Thus, for example, it 
is now well known that there are important substances in 
the body, the hormones and the neurotransmitters, that 
fundamentally affect the entire functioning of the brain 
and nervous system. These substances respond, from 
moment to moment, to what a person knows, to what he 
thinks, and to what all this means to him. It is by now 
fairly well established that in this way the brain cells and 
their functioning are profoundly affected by knowledge 
and thought, especially when these give rise to strong 
feelings and passions. It is thus quite plausible that in­
sight, which must arise in a state of great mental energy 
and passion, could change the brain cells in an even more 
profound way. 
What has been said here necessarily gives only a brief 
outline of what is in the dialogues, and cannot show the 
full scope and depth of the inquiry that takes place within 
them into the nature of human consciousness and of the 
problems that have arisen in this consciousness. Indeed, 
I would say that the result has been a concise and easily 
3 

readable book, which contains the essential spirit of the 
whole of Krishnamurti's teachings, and throws an impor­
tant further light on them. 
David Bohm

ONE 
DAVID BOHM: 
There are several problems that we 
might discuss. One is, when a person is just starting out 
he has to make a living. There are very few opportunities 
now, and most of these are in jobs which are extremely 
limited. 
J. 
KRISHNAMURTI: 
And 
there 
IS 
unemployment 
throughout the world. I wonder what he would do, know­
ing that the future is grim, very depressing, dangerous, 
and so uncertain. Where would you begin? 
DB: 
Well I think one would have to stand back from 
all the particular problems of one's own needs and the 
needs of people around one. 
JK: 
Are you saying one should really forget oneself for 
the time being? 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
Even if I did forget myself, when I look at this 
world in which I am going to live, and have some kind of 
career or profession, what would I do? This is a problem 
that I think most young people are facing. 
DB: 
Yes. That's clear. Well, have you something that 
you would suggest? 
5 

JK: 
You see I don't think in terms of evolution. 
DB: 
I understand that. That's the point I was expect-
ing we would discuss. 
JK: 
I don't think there is psychological evolution at all. 
DB: 
We have discussed this quite often so I think I 
understand to some extent what you mean. But I think 
that people who are new to this are not going to under­
stand. 
JK: 
Yes, we will discuss this whole question, if you will. 
Why are we concerned about the future? Surely the 
whole future is now. 
DB: 
In a sense the whole future is now, but we have 
to make that clear. It goes very much against the whole 
way of thinking, of the tradition of mankind ... .  
JK: 
I know. Mankind thinks in terms of evolution, con-
tinuance, and so on. 
DB: 
Perhaps we could approach it in another way? 
That is, evolution seems in the present era to be the most 
natural way to think. So I would like to ask you what 
objections you have to thinking in terms of evolution. 
Could I explain a point? This word evolution has many 
meanmgs. 
JK: 
Of course. We are talking psychologically. 
DB: 
Now the first point is, let's dispose of it physically. 
JK: 
An acorn will grow into an oak. 
6 

DB: 
Also the species have evolved: for example, from 
the plants to the animals and to man. 
JK: 
Yes, we have taken a million years to be what we 
are. 
DB: 
You have no question that that has happened? 
JK: 
No, that has happened. 
DB: 
It may continue to happen. 
JK: 
That is evolution. 
DB: 
That is a valid process. 
JK: 
Of course. 
DB: 
It takes place in time. And, therefore, in that re­
gion the past, present, and future are important. 
JK: 
Yes obviously. I don't know a certain language, I 
need time to learn it. 
DB: 
Also it takes time to improve the brain. You see, 
if the brain started out small, and then it got bigger and 
bigger, that took a million years. 
JK: 
And it becomes much more complex, and so on. 
All that needs time. All that is movement in space and 
time. 
DB: 
Yes. So you will admit physical time and neuro-
physiological time. 
JK: 
Neuro-physiological time, absolutely. Of course. 
Any sane man would. 
7 

DB: 
Now most people also admit psychological time, 
what they call mental time. 
JK: 
Yes, that is what we are talking about. Whether 
there is such a thing as psychological tomorrow, psycho­
logical evolution. 
DB: 
Or yesterday. Now at first sight I am afraid this 
will sound strange. It seems I can remember yesterday. 
And there is tomorrow; I can anticipate. And it has hap­
pened many times, you know days have succeeded each 
other. So I do have the experience of time, from yester­
day to today to tomorrow. 
JK: 
Of course. That is simple enough. 
DB: 
Now what is it that you are denying? 
JK: 
I deny that I will be something, become better. 
DB: 
I can change . . .  but now there are two ways of 
looking at that. One approach is, will I intentionally be­
come better because I am trying? Or is evolution a natu­
ral, inevitable process, in which we are being swept along 
as if in a current, and perhaps becoming better, or worse, 
or finding that something is happening to us. 
JK: 
Psychologically. 
DB: 
Psychologically, which takes time, which may not 
be the result of my trying to become better. It may or may 
not be. Some people think one way, some another. But 
are you denying also that there is a kind of natural psy­
chological evolution as there was a natural biological 
evolution? 
8 

JK: 
I am denying that, yes. 
DB: 
Now why do you deny it? 
JK: 
Because, first of all, what is the psyche, the me, the 
ego, and so on? What is it? 
DB: 
The word psyche has many meanings. It may 
mean the mind, for example. Do you mean that the ego 
is the same thing? 
JK: 
The ego. I am talking of the ego, the me. 
DB: 
Yes. Now some people think there will be an evo-
lution in which the me is transcended, that it will rise to 
a higher level. 
JK: 
Yes, will the transition need time? 
DB: 
A transcendence, a transition. 
JK: 
Yes. That is my whole question. 
DB: 
So there are two questions: one is, will the me 
ever improve? And the other is, even if we suppose 
we want to get beyond the me, can that be done in 
time? 
JK: 
That cannot be done in time. 
DB: 
Now we have to make it clear why not. 
JK: 
Yes. I will. We will go into it. What is the me? If 
the psyche has such different meanings, the me is the 
whole movement which thought has brought about. 
DB: 
Why do you say that? 
9 

JK: 
The me is the consciousness, my consciousness: 
the me is my name, form, and all the experiences, 
remembrances, and so on that I have had. The whole 
structure of the me is put together by thought. 
DB: 
That again would be something which some peo-
ple might find it hard to accept. 
JK: 
Of course. We are discussing it. 
DB: 
Now the first experience, the first feeling I have 
about the me is that it is there independently and that the 
me is thinking. 
JK: 
Is the me independent of my thinking? 
DB: 
Well my own first feeling is that the me is there 
independent of my thinking. And that it is the me that is 
thinking, you see. 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
Just as I am here, and I could move; I could move 
my arm, I could think, or I could move my head. Now is 
that an illusion? 
JK: 
No. 
DB: 
Why? 
JK: 
Because when I move my arm there is the inten­
tion to grasp something, to take something, which is first 
the movement of thought. That makes the arm move, 
and so on. My contention is-and I am ready to accept 
it as false or true-that thought is the basis of all this. 
IO 

DB: 
Yes. Your contention is that the whole sense of 
the me and what it is doing is coming out of thought. 
Now what you mean by thought is not merely intellec­
tual? 
JK: 
No, of course not. Thought is the movement of 
experience, knowledge, and memory. It is this whole 
movement. 
DB: 
It sounds to me as if you mean the consciousness 
as a whole. 
JK: 
As a whole, that's right. 
DB: 
And you are saying that that movement is the me? 
JK: 
The whole content of that consciousness is the me. 
That me is not different from my consciousness. 
DB: 
Yes. I think one could say that I am my conscious-
ness, for if I am not conscious I am not here. 
JK: 
Of course. 
DB: 
Now is consciousness nothing but what you have 
just described, which includes thought, feeling, inten-
• 
";> 
t1on . . . .  
JK: 
. . .  intention, aspirations . 
DB: 
. . . memories . . .  
JK: 
. . .  memories, beliefs, dogmas, the rituals that are 
performed. The whole, like the computer that has been 
programmed. 
I I 

DB: 
Yes. Now that certainly is in consciousness. Ev­
erybody would agree, but many people would feel that 
there is more to it than that; that consciousness may go 
beyond that. 
JK: 
Let's go into it. The content of our consciousness 
makes up the consciousness. 
DB: 
Yes, I think that requires some understanding. 
The ordinary use of the word content is quite different. 
If you say that the content of a glass is water, the glass 
is one thing and the water is another. 
JK: 
Consciousness is made up of all that it has remem­
bered: beliefs, dogmas, rituals, fears, pleasures, sorrow. 
DB: 
Yes. Now if all that were absent, would there be 
no consciousness? 
JK: 
Not as we know it. 
DB: 
But there would still be a kind of consciousness? 
JK: 
A totally different kind. But consciousness, as we 
know it, is all that. 
DB: 
As we generally know it. 
JK: 
Yes. And that is the result of multiple activities of 
thought. Thought has put all this together, which is my 
consciousness-the reactions, the responses, the memo­
ries-extraordinary, complex intricacies and subtleties. 
All that makes up consciousness. 
DB: 
As we know it. 
12 

JK: 
But does that consciousness have a future? 
DB: 
Yes. Does it have a past? 
JK: 
Of course. Remembrance. 
DB: 
Remembrance, yes. Why do you say it has no 
future then? 
JK: 
If it has a future it will be exactly the same kind of 
thing, moving. The same activities, the same thoughts, 
modified, but the pattern will be repeated over and over 
agam. 
DB: 
Are you saying that thought can only repeat? 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
But there is a feeling, for example, that thought 
can develop new ideas. 
JK: 
But thought is limited because knowledge is lim-
ited. 
DB: 
Well, yes, that might require some discussion. 
JK: 
Yes, we must discuss it. 
DB: 
Why do you say knowledge is always limited? 
JK: 
Because you, as a scientist, are experimenting, 
adding, searching. And after you some other person will 
add more. So knowledge, which is born of experience, is 
limited. 
DB: 
But some people have said it isn't. They would 
hope to obtain perfect, or absolute, knowledge of the 
laws of nature. 

JK: 
The laws of nature are not the laws of human 
beings. 
DB: 
Well, do you want to restrict the discussion then 
to knowledge about the human being? 
JK: 
Of course, that's all we can talk about. 
DB: 
Even there, it is a question of whether that knowl-
edge of nature is possible too. 
JK: 
Yes. We are talking about the future of humanity. 
DB: 
So are we saying that man cannot obtain unlim-
ited knowledge of the psyche? 
JK: 
That's right. 
DB: 
There is always more that is unknown. 
JK: 
Yes. There is always more and more unknown. So 
if once we admit that knowledge is limited, then thought 
is limited. 
DB: 
Yes, thought depends on knowledge, and the 
knowledge does not cover everything. Therefore 
thought will not be able to handle everything that hap­
pens. 
JK: 
That's right. But that is what the politicians and all 
the other people are doing. They think thought can solve 
every problem. 
DB: 
Yes. You can see in the case of politicians that 
knowledge is very limited, in fact it is almost nonexistent! 

And, therefore, when you lack adequate knowledge of 
what you are dealing with, you create confusion. 
JK: 
Yes. So then as thought is limited, our conscious­
ness, which has been put together by thought, is limited. 
DB: 
Now can you make that clear? That means we can 
only stay in the same circle. 
JK: 
The same circle. 
DB: 
You see, one of the ideas might be, if you com-
pare with science, that people might think although their 
knowledge is limited they are constantly discovering. 
JK: 
What you discover is added to, but is still limited. 
DB: 
It is still limited. That's the point. I can keep on; 
I think one of the ideas behind a scientific approach is 
that, though knowledge is limited, I can discover and 
keep up with the actuality. 
JK: 
But that is also limited. 
DB: 
My discoveries are limited. And there is always 
the unknown which I have not discovered. 
JK: 
That is what I am saying. The unknown, the limit-
less, cannot be captured by thought. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
Because thought in itself is limited. You and I 
agree to that; we not only agree but it is a fact. 
DB: 
Perhaps we could bring it out still more. That is, 
thought is limited, even though we might intellectually 

consider that thought is not limited. There is a very 
strong predisposition, tendency, to feel that way-that 
thought can do anything. 
JK: 
Anything. It can't. See what it has done m the 
world. 
DB: 
Well, I agree that it has done some terrible things, 
but that doesn't prove that it is always wrong. You see, 
perhaps you could blame it on the people who have used 
it wrongly. 
JK: 
I know, that is a good old trick! But thought in 
itself is limited, therefore whatever it does is limited. 
DB: 
Yes, and you are saying that it is limited in a very 
senous way. 
JK: 
That's right. Of course m a very, very senous 
way. 
DB: 
Could we bring that out? Say what that way is? 
JK: 
That way is what is happening in the world. 
DB: 
All right, let's look at that. 
JK: 
The totalitarian ideals are the invention of 
thought. 
DB: 
The very word totalitarian means that people 
wanted to cover the totality, but they couldn't. 
JK: 
They couldn't. 
DB: 
The thing collapsed. 
JK: 
It is collapsing. 

DB: 
But then there are those who say they are not 
totalitarians. 
JK: 
But the democrats, the republicans, the idealists, 
and so on, all their thinking is limited. 
DB: 
Yes, and it is limited in a way that is . . .  
JK: 
. . .  very destructive. 
DB: 
Now, could we bring that out? You see I could 
say, "All right my thought is limited, but it may not be 
all that serious. " Why is this so important? 
JK: 
That is fairly simple: because whatever action is 
born of limited thought must inevitably breed conflict. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
Like dividing humanity religiously, or into na-
tionalities, and so on, has created havoc in the world. 
DB: 
Yes, now let's connect that with the limitation of 
thought. My knowledge is limited: how does that lead me 
to divide the world into . . . 
JK: 
Aren't we seeking security? 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
And we thought there was security in the family, 
in the tribe, in nationalism. So we thought there was 
security in division. 
DB: 
Yes. Now it has come out. Take the tribe, for 
example: one may feel insecure, and one then says "With 
the tribe I am secure. " That is a conclusion. And I think 

I know enough to be sure that is so-but I don't. Other 
things happen that I don't know, which make that very 
insecure. Other tribes come along. 
JK: 
No, no! The very division creates insecurity. 
DB: 
Yes, it helps to create it, but I am trying to say 
that I don't know enough to know that. I don't see 
that. 
JK: 
But one doesn't see it because one has not thought 
about anything, not looked at the world, as a whole. 
DB: 
Well the thought which aims at security attempts 
to know everything important. As soon as it knows every­
thing important it says "This will bring security." But 
there are a lot of things it still doesn't know, and one is 
that this very thought itself is divisive. 
JK: 
Yes. In itself it is limited. Anything that is limited 
must inevitably create conflict. If l say I am an individual, 
that is limited. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
I am concerned with myself, that is very limited. 
DB: 
We have to make this clear. If I say this is a table 
which is limited, it creates no conflict. 
JK: 
No, there is no conflict there. 
DB: 
But when I say, this is "me," that creates conflict. 
JK: 
The "me" is a divisive entity. 
18 

DB: 
Let us see more clearly why. 
JK: 
Because it is separative; it is concerned with itself. 
The "me" identifying with the greater nation is still divi­
sive. 
DB: 
I define myself in the interest of security so that 
I know what I am as opposed to what you are, and I 
protect myself. Now this creates a division between me 
and you. 
JK: 
We and they, and so on. 
DB: 
Now that comes from my limited thought, be-
cause I don't understand that we are really closely related 
and connected. 
JK: 
We are human beings, and all human beings have 
more or less the same problems. 
DB: 
No, I haven't understood that. My knowledge is 
limited; I think that we can make a distinction and protect 
ourselves, and me, and not the others. 
JK: 
Yes, that's right. 
DB: 
But in the very act of doing that I create instabil-
ity. 
JK: 
That's right, insecurity. So if not merely intellectu­
ally or verbally but actually, we feel that we are the rest 
of humanity, then the responsibility becomes immense. 
DB: 
Well, how can you do anything about that respon­
sibility? 

JK: 
Then I either contribute to the whole mess, or 
keep out of it. 
DB: 
I think we have touched upon an important point. 
We say the whole of humanity, of mankind, is one, and 
therefore to create division is . 
JK: 
. . .  dangerous. 
DB: 
Yes. Whereas to create division between me and 
the table is not dangerous, because in some sense we are 
not one. 
JK: 
Of course. 
DB: 
That is, only in some very general sense are we at 
one. Now mankind doesn't realize that it is all one. 
JK: 
Why? 
DB: 
Let's go into it. This is a crucial point. There are 
so many divisions, not only between nations and reli­
gions but between one person and another. 
JK: 
Why is there this division? 
DB: 
The feeling is, at least in the modern era, that 
every human being is an individual. This may not have 
been so strong in the past. 
JK: 
That is what I question. I question altogether 
whether we are individuals. 
DB: 
That is a big question . . . .  
JK: 
Of course. We said just now that the consciousness 
which is me is similar to the rest of mankind. They all 
20 

suffer, all have fears, are insecure; they have their own 
particular gods and rituals, all put together by thought. 
DB: 
I think there are two questions here. One is, not 
everybody feels that he is similar to others. Most people 
feel they have some unique distinction . . . .  
JK: 
What do you mean by "unique distinction"? Dis-
tinction in doing something? 
DB: 
There may be many things. For example, one 
nation may feel that it is able to do certain things better 
than another; one person has some special things he 
does, or a particular quality . . .. 
JK: 
Of course. Somebody else is better in this or that. 
DB: 
He may take pride in his own special abilities, or 
advantages. 
JK: 
But when you put away that, basically we are the 
same. 
DB: 
You are saying these things which you have just 
described are ... 
JK: 
. .. superficial. 
DB: 
Yes. Now what are the things that are basic? 
JK: 
Fear, sorrow, pain, anxiety, loneliness, and all the 
human travail. 
DB: 
But many people might feel that the basic things 
are the highest achievements of man. For one thing, peo-
2 1  

ple may feel proud of man's achievement in science and 
art and culture and technology. 
JK: 
We have achieved in all those directions, certainly. 
In technology, communication, travel, medicine, sur­
gery, we have advanced tremendously. 
DB: 
Yes, it is really remarkable in many ways . 
JK: 
There is no question about it. But what have we 
psychologically achieved? 
DB: 
None of this has affected us psychologically. 
JK: 
Yes, that's right. 
DB: 
And the psychological question is more impor-
tant than any of te others, because if the psychological 
question is not cleared up the rest is dangerous. 
JK: 
Yes. If we are psychologically limited, then what­
ever we do will be limited, and the technology will then 
be used by our limited . . .  
DB: 
.
. . yes, the master is this limited psyche, and 
not the rational structure of technology. And in fact 
technology then becomes a dangerous instrument. So 
that is one point, that the psyche is at the core of it all, 
and if the psyche is not in order then the rest is useless. 
Then, although we are saying there are certain basic 
disorders in the psyche common to us all, we may all 
have a potential for something else. The next point is 
are we all one really? Even though we are all similar, 
that doesn't mean we are all the same, that we are all 
one. 
2 2  

JK: 
We said, in our consciousness basically we all have 
the same ground on which we stand. 
DB: 
Yes, from the fact that the human body is similar, 
but that doesn't prove they are all the same. 
JK: 
Of course not. Your body is different from mine. 
DB: 
Yes, we are in different places, we are different 
entities, and so on. But I think you are saying that the 
consciousness is not an entity which is individual. 
JK: 
That's right. 
DB: 
The body is an entity which has a certain individu-
ality. 
JK: 
That all seems so clear. Your body is different 
from mine. I have a different name from you. 
DB: 
Yes, we are different. Though of similar material 
we are different. We can't exchange because the proteins 
in one body may not agree with those in the other. Now 
many people feel that way about the mind, saying that 
there is a chemistry between people which may agree or 
disagree. 
JK: 
Yes but actually if you go deeper into the question, 
consciousness is shared by all human beings. 
DB: 
Now the feeling is that the consciousness is indi-
vidual and that it is communicated . . . .  
JK: 
I think that is an illusion, because we are sticking 
to something that is not true. 

DB: 
Do you want to say that there 1s one conscious-
ness of mankind? 
JK: 
It is all one. 
DB: 
That is important, because whether it is many or 
one is a crucial question. 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
It could be many, which are then communicating 
and building up the larger unit. Or are you saying that 
from the very beginning it is all one? 
JK: 
From the very beginning it is all one. 
DB: 
And the sense of separateness is an illusion? 
JK: 
That is what I am saying, over and over again. 
That seems so logical, sane. The other is insanity. 
DB: 
Yes, but people don't· feel, at least not immedi­
ately, that the notion of separate existence is insane, 
because one extrapolates from the body to the mind. 
One says, it is quite sensible to say my body is separate 
from yours, and inside my body is my mind. Now are you 
saying that the mind is not inside the body? 
JK: 
That is quite a different question. Let's finish with 
the other first. Each one of us thinks that we are separate 
individuals, psychically . . . .  What we have done in the 
world is a colossal mess. 
DB: 
Well if we think we are separate when we are not 
separate, then it will clearly be a colossal mess. 

JK: 
That is what is happening. Each one thinks he 
has to do what he wants to do; fulfill himself. So he is 
struggling in his separateness to achieve peace, to 
achieve security, and that security and peace are totally 
denied. 
DB: 
The reason they are denied is because there is 
no separation. You see, if there were really separation 
it would be a rational thing to try to do. But if we are try­
ing to separate what is inseparable the result will be 
chaos. 
JK: 
That's right. 
DB: 
Now that is clear, but I think that it will not be 
clear to people immediately that the consciousness of 
mankind is one inseparable whole. 
JK: 
Yes, an inseparable whole. 
DB: 
Many questions will arise if we consider the no-
tion, but I don't know if we have gone far enough into 
this yet. One question is, why do we think we are sepa­
rate? 
JK: 
Why do I think I am separate? That is my condi-
tioning. 
DB: 
Yes, but how did we ever adopt such a foolish 
conditioning? 
JK: 
From childhood, it is mine, my toy, not yours. 
DB: 
But the first feeling I get of "it is mine" is because 
I feel I am separate. It isn't clear how the mind, which was 
25 

one, came to this illusion that it is all broken up into 
many pieces. 
JK: 
I think it is again the activity of thought. Thought 
in its very nature is divisive, fragmentary, and therefore 
I am a fragment. 
DB: 
Thought will create a sense of fragments. You 
could see, for example, that once we decide to set up a 
nation we will think we are separate from other nations, 
and all sorts of consequences follow which make the 
whole thing seem independently real. We have separate 
language, a separate flag, and we set up a boundary. And 
after a while we see so much evidence of separation that 
we forget how it started, and say it was there always, and 
that we are merely proceeding from what was there al­
ways. 
JK: 
Of course. That's why I feel that if once we grasp 
the nature and structure of thought, how thought oper­
ates, what is the source of thought-and therefore it is 
always limited-if we really see that, then . . .  
DB: 
Now the source of thought is what? Is it memory? 
JK: 
Memory. The remembrance of things past, which 
is knowledge, and knowledge is the outcome of experi­
ence, and experience is always limited. 
DB: 
Thought also includes, of course, the attempt to 
go forward, to use logic, to take into account discoveries 
and insights. 
JK: 
As we were saying some time ago, thought is time. 

DB: 
All right. Thoughl is lime. Thal requires more 
discussion too, because the first response is to say time 
is there first, and thought is taking place in time. 
JK: 
Ah, no. 
DB: 
For example, if movement is taking place, if the 
body is moving, this requires time. 
JK: 
To go from here to there needs time. To learn a 
language needs time. 
DB: 
Yes. To grow a plant needs time. 
JK: 
To paint a picture takes time. 
DB: 
We also say that to think takes time. 
JK: 
So we think in terms of time. 
DB: 
Yes, the first point that one would tend to look at 
is whether just as everything takes time, to think takes 
time? Are you saying something else, which is that 
thought is time? 
JK: 
Thought is time. 
DB: 
That is psychologically speaking. 
JK: 
Psychologically, of course. 
DB: 
Now how do we understand that? 
JK: 
How do we understand what? 
DB: 
Thought is time. You see it is not obvious. 
JK: 
Oh yes. Would you say thought is movement, and 
time is movement? 

DB: 
That's movement. You see, time is a mysterious 
thing: people have argued about it. We could say that 
time requires movement. I could understand that we can­
not have time without movement. 
JK: 
Time is movement. Time is not separate from 
movement. 
DB: 
I don't say it is separate from movement. . . .  You 
see, if we said time and movement are one . 
JK: 
Yes, we are saying that. 
DB: 
They cannot be separated? 
JK: 
No. 
DB: 
That. seems fairly clear. Now there is physical 
movement, which means physical time. 
JK: 
Physical time, hot and cold, and also dark and 
light . . .  
DB: 
. the seasons . . . 
JK: 
. . .  sunset and sunrise. All that. 
DB: 
Yes. Now then we have the movement of thought. 
That brings in the question of the nature of thought. Is 
thought nothing but a movement in the nervous system, 
in the brain? Would you say that? 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
Some people have said it includes the movement 
of the nervous system, but there might be something 
beyond. 

JK: 
What is time, actually? Time is hope. 
DB: 
Psychologically. 
JK: 
Psychologically. I am talking entirely psychologi-
cally for the moment. Hope is time. Becoming is time. 
Achieving is time. Now take the question of becoming: I 
want to become something, psychologically. I want to 
become nonviolent. Take thatב for example. That is alto­
gether a fallacy. 
DB: 
We understand it is a fallacy, but the reason it is 
a fallacy is that there is no time of that kind, is that it? 
JK: 
No. Human beings are violent. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
And they have been talking a great deal-Tolstoy, 
and in India-of nonviolence. The fact is we are violent. 
And the nonviolence is not real. But we want to become 
that. 
DB: 
But it is again an extension of the kind of thought 
that we have with regard to material things. If you see a 
desert, the desert is real and you say the garden is not 
real, but in your mind is the garden which will come when 
you put the water there. So we say we can plan for the 
future when the desert will become fertile. Now we have 
to be careful, we say we are violent but we cannot by 
similar planning become nonviolent. 
JK: 
No. 
DB: 
Why is that? 
29 

JK: 
Why? Because the nonviolent state cannot exist 
when there is violence. That's just an ideal. 
DB: 
One has to make this more clear, in the same 
sense the fertile state and the desert don't exist together 
either. I think you are saying that in the case of the mind, 
when you are violent, nonviolence has no meaning. 
JK: 
Violence is the only state. 
DB: 
That is all there is. 
JK: 
Yes, not the other. 
DB: 
The movement towards the other is illusory. 
JK: 
So all ideals are illusory, psychologically. The 
ideal of building a marvelous bridge is not illusory. You 
can plan it, but to have psychological ideals . . .  
DB: 
Yes, if you are violent and you continue to be 
violent while you are trying to be nonviolent, it has no 
meanmg. 
JK: 
No meaning, and yet that has become such an 
important thing. The becoming, which is either becom­
ing "what is" or becoming away from "what is." 
DB: 
Yes. "What should be." If you say there can be 
no sense to becoming in the way of self-improvement, 
that's . . .  
JK: 
Oh, self-improvement is something so utterly 
ugly. We are saying that the source of all this is a move­
ment of thought as time. When once we have made 
time, psychologically, all the other ideals, nonviolence, 

achieving some super state, and so on, become utterly 
illusory. 
DB: 
Yes. When you talk of the movement of thought 
as time, it seems to me that that time which comes from 
the movement of thought is illusory. 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
We sense it as time, but it is not a real kind of 
time. 
JK: 
That is why we asked, what is time? 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
I need time to go from here to there. I need time 
if I want to learn engineering. I must study it; it takes 
time. That same movement is carried over into the psy­
che. We say, I need time to be good. I need time to be 
enlightened. 
DB: 
Yes, that will always create a conflict. One part of 
you and another. So that movement in which you say, I 
need time, also creates a division in the psyche. Between 
the observer and the observed. 
JK: 
Yes, we are saying the observer is the observed. 
DB: 
And therefore there is no time, psychologically. 
JK: 
That's right. The experiencer, the thinker, is the 
thought. There is no thinker separate from thought. 
DB: 
All that you are saying seems very reasonable, but 
I think that it goes so strongly against the tradition we are 
3 1 

used to that it will be extraordinarily hard for people, 
generally speaking, really to understand. 
JK: 
Most people just want a comfortable way of living: 
"Let me carry on as I am, for God's sake, leave me 
alone!" 
DB: 
But that is the result of so much conflict, that 
people are warned off by it, I think. 
JK: 
But conflict exists, whether we like it or not. So, 
that is the whole point, is it possible to live a life without 
conflict? 
DB: 
Yes, that is all implicit in what has been said. The 
source of conflict is thought, or knowledge, or the past. 
JK: 
So then one asks: is it possible to transcend 
thought? 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
Or is it possible to end knowledge? I am putting 
it psychologically . . . .  
DB: 
Yes. We say that knowledge of material objects 
and things like that, knowledge of science, will continue. 
JK: 
Absolutely. That must continue. 
DB: ' But what you call self-knowledge is what you are 
asking to end, isn't it? 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
On the other hand people have said-even you 
have said-that self-knowledge is very important. 
32 

JK: 
Self-knowledge is important, but if I take time to 
understand myself, I will understand myself eventually 
by examination, analysis, by watching my whole relation­
ship with others and so on-all that involves time. And 
I say there is another way of looking at the whole thing 
without time. Which is, when the observer is the ob­
served. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
In that observation there is no time. 
DB: 
Could we go into that further? I mean, for exam-
ple, if you say there is no time, but still you feel that you 
can remember an hour ago you were someone else. Now 
in what sense can we say that there is no time? 
JK: 
Time is division. As thought is division. That is 
why thought is time. 
DB: 
Time is a series of divisions of past, present, fu­
ture. 
JK: 
Thought is divisive. So time 1s thought. Or 
thought is time. 
DB: 
It doesn't exactly follow from what you said .. .. 
JK: 
Let's go into it. 
DB: 
Yes. You see, at first sight one would think that 
thought makes divisions of all kinds, with the ruler and 
with all kinds of things, and also divides up intervals of 
time: past, present and future. Now it doesn't follow, 
from just that, that thought is time. 
33 

JK: 
Look, we said time is movement. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
Thought is also a series of movements. So both are 
movements. 
DB: 
Thought is a movement, we suppose, of the ner-
vous system and . . .  
JK: 
You see, it is a movement of becoming. I am talk-
ing psychologically. 
DB: 
Psychologically. But, whenever you think, some­
thing is also moving in the blood, in the nerves, and so 
on. Now when you talk of a psychological movement, do 
you mean just a change of content? 
JK: 
Change of content? 
DB: 
Well what is the movement? What is moving? 
JK: 
Look, I am this, and I am attempting to become 
something else psychologically. 
DB: 
So that movement is in the content of your 
thought? 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
If you say "I am this and I am attempting to be­
come that," then I am in movement. At least, I feel I am 
m movement. 
JK: 
Say, for instance, that I am greedy. Greed is a 
movement. 
DB: 
What kind of a movement is it? 
34 

JK: 
To get what I want, to get more. It is a movement. 
DB: 
All right. 
JK: 
And I find that movement painful. Then I try not 
to be greedy. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
The attempt not to be greedy is a movement of 
time, is becoming. 
DB: 
Yes, but even the greed was becoming. 
JK: 
Of course. So, is the real question, is it possible 
not to become, psychologically? 
DB: 
It seems that would require that you should not 
be anything psychologically. As soon as you define your­
self in any way, then ... 
JK: 
No, we will define it in a minute or two. 
Dij: 
I meant, ifl define myself as greedy, say that I am 
greedy, or I am this, or I am that, then either I will want 
to become something else or to remain what I ·am. 
JK: 
Now can I remain what I am? Can I remain not 
with non-greed but with greed? Greed is not different 
from me; greed is me. 
DB: 
The ordinary way of thinking is that I am here, 
and I could either be greedy or not greedy. 
JK: 
Of course. 
DB: 
As these are attributes which I may or may not 
have. 
35 

JK: 
But the attributes are me. 
DB: 
Now that again goes very much against our com-
mon language and experience. 
JK: 
All the qualities, the attributes, the virtues, the 
judgments, the conclusions, and opinions are me. 
DB: 
It seems to me that this would have to be per­
ceived immediately . . . .  
JK: 
That is the whole question. To perceive the total­
ity of this whole movement, instantly. Then we come to 
the point-it sounds a little odd, and perhaps a little 
crazy, but it is not-is it possible to perceive without all 
the movement of memory? To perceive something di­
rectly without the word, without the reaction, without the 
memories entering into perception. 
DB: 
That is a very big question, because memory has 
constantly entered perception. It would raise the ques­
tion of what is going to stop memory from entering per­
ception? 
JK: 
Nothing can stop it. But if we see the reason, the 
rationality of the activity of memory which is limited-in 
the very perception that it is limited, we have moved out 
of it into another dimension. 
DB: 
It seems to me that you have to perceive the 
whole of the limitation of memory. 
JK: 
Yes, not one part. 
DB: 
You can see in general that memory is limited, but 
there are many ways in which this is not obvious. For 

example, many of our reactions that are not obvious may 
be memory, but we don't experience them as memory. 
Suppose I am becoming: I experience greed, and I have 
the urge to become less greedy. I can remember that I 
am greedy but think that this "me" is the one who 
remembers, not the other way around, not that memory 
creates "me"-right? 
JK: 
All this really comes down to whether humanity 
can live without conflict. It basically comes to that. Can 
we have peace on this earth? The activities of thought 
never bring it about. 
DB: 
It seems clear from what has been said that th׏ 
activity of thought cannot bring about peace: it inher­
ently brings about conflict. 
JK: 
Yes, if we once really see that, our whole activity 
would be totally different. 
DB: 
But are you saying then that there is an activity 
which is not tought? Which is beyond thoughfr 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
And which is not only beyond thought but which 
does not require the cooperation of thought? That it is 
possible for this to go on when thought is absent? 
JK: 
That is the real point. We have often discussed 
this, whether there is anything beyond thought. Not 
something holy, sacred-we are not talking of that. We 
are asking, is there an activity which is not touched by 
thought? We are saying there is. And that that activity is 
the highest form of intelligence. 

DB: 
Yes, now we have brought in intelligence. 
JK: 
I know, I purposively brought it in ! So intelligence 
is not the activity of cunning thought. There is intelli­
gence to build a cable. . . . 
DB: 
Well, intelligence can use thought, as you have 
often said. That is, thought can be the action of intelli­
gence-would you put it that way? 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
Or it could be the action of memory? 
JK: 
That's it. Either it is the action born of memory 
and memory being limited, therefore thought is limited, 
and it has its own activity which then brings about con­
flict. . . . 
DB: 
I think this would connect with what people are 
saying about computers. Every computer must eventu­
ally depend on some kind of memory which is put in, 
programmed. And that must be limited. 
JK: 
Of course. 
DB: 
Therefore when we operate from memory we are 
not very different from a computer; the other way around 
perhaps, the computer is not very different from us. 
JK: 
I would say a Hindu has been programmed for the 
last five thousand years to be a Hindu; or, in this country, 
you have been programmed as British, or as a Catholic 
or a Protestant. So we are all programmed to a certain 
extent. 

DB: 
Yes. but you are bringing in the notion of an 
intelligence which is free of the program. which is crea­
tive. perhaps . . . .  
JK: 
Yes. That intelligence has nothing to do with 
memory and knowledge. 
DB: 
It may act in memory and knowledge but it is has 
nothing to do with it. . . .  
JK: 
That's right. I mean, how do you find out whether 
it has any reality and is not just imagination and romantic 
nonsense? To come to that. one has to go into the whole 
question of suffering, whether there is an end to suffer­
ing. And as long as suffering and fear and the pursuit of 
pleasure exist there cannot be love. 
DB: 
There are many questions there. Suffering. plea­
sure. fear. anger, violence, and greed-all of those are 
the response of memory. 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
They are nothing to do with intelligence. 
JK: 
They are all part of thought and memory. 
DB: 
And as long as they are going on it seems that 
intelligence cannot operate in thought. or through 
thought. 
JK: 
That's right. So there must be freedom from suf­
fering. 
DB: 
Well that is a very key point. 
39 

JK: 
Thal is really a very serious and deep queslion. 
Whelher it is possible lo end suffering, which is the end­
ing of me. 
DB: 
Yes, it may seem repetitious bul the feeling is that 
I am there, and I either suffer or don't suffer. I either 
enjoy things or suffer. Now I think you are saying that 
suffering arises from thought; it is thought. 
JK: 
Identification. Attachment. 
DB: 
So what is it that suffers? Memory may produce 
pleasure C'.!-nd then when it doesn't work it produces 
the opposite of the feeling of pleasure-pain and suffer­
mg. 
JK: 
Not only that. Suffering is much more complex, 
isn't it? 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
What is suffering? The meaning of the word is to 
have pain, to have grief, to feel utterly lost, lonely. 
DB: 
It seems to me that it is not only pain, but a kind 
of total,. very pervasive pain. . . . 
JK: 
But suffering is the loss of someone. 
DB: 
Or the loss of something very important. 
JK: 
Yes, of course. Loss of my wife, my son, brother, 
or whatever it is, and the desperate sense of loneliness. 
DB: 
Or else just simply the fact that the whole world 
is going into such a state. 

JK: 
Of course . .. .  All the wars. 
DB: 
It makes everything meaningless, you see. 
JK: 
What a lot of suffering wars have created. And 
wars have been going on for thousands of years. That is 
why I am saying we are carrying on with the same pattern 
of the last five thousand years or more ... . 
DB: 
One can easily see that the violence and hatred in 
wars will interfere with intelligence. 
JK: 
Obviously. 
DB: 
But some people have felt that by going through 
suffering they become . .  
JK: 
. .. intelligent? 
DB: 
. . .  Purified, like going through the crucible. 
JK: 
I know. That through suffering you learn. That 
through suffering your ego is vanished, dissolved. 
DB: 
Yes, dissolved, refined. 
JK: 
It is not. People have suffered immensely, how 
many wars, how many tears, and the destructive nature 
of governments? And unemployment, ignorance . .. 
DB: 
. . .  ignorance of disease, pain, everything. But 
what is suffering really? Why does it destroy intelligence, 
or prevent it? What is going on? 
JK: 
Suffering is a shock; I suffer, I have pain, it is the 
essence of the "me. " 
41 

DB: 
The difficulty with suffering is that it is the me that 
is there that is suffering. 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
And this me is really being sorry for itself in some 
way. 
JK: 
My suffering is different from your suffering. 
DB: 
Yes, it isolates itself. It creates an illusion of some 
kind. 
JK: 
We don't see that suffering is shared by all human-
ity. 
DB: 
Yes, but suppose we do see it is shared by all 
humanity? 
JK: 
Then I begin to question what suffering is. It is not 
my suffering. 
DB: 
That is important. In order to understand the 
nature of suffering I have to get out of this idea that it is 
my suffering because as long as I believe it is my suffering 
I have an illusory notion of the whole thing. 
JK: 
And I can never end it. 
DB: 
If you are dealing with an illusion you can do 
nothing with it. You see why-we have to come back. 
Why is suffering the suffering of many? At first it seems 
that I feel pain in the tooth, or else I have a loss, or 
something has happened to me, and the other person 
seems perfectly happy. 
42 

JK: 
Happy, yes . But also he is suffering in his own way. 
DB: 
Yes. At the moment he doesn't see it, but he has 
his problems too. 
JK: 
Suffering is common to all humanity. 
DB: 
But the fact that it is common is not enough to 
make it all one. 
JK: 
It is actual. 
DB: 
Are you saying that the suffering of mankind is all 
one, inseparable? 
JK: 
Yes, that is what I have been saying. 
DB: 
As is the consciousness of man? 
JK: 
Yes, that's right. 
DB: 
That when anybody suffers, the whole of mankind 
is suffering. 
JK: 
The whole point 1s, we have suffered from the 
beginning of time, and we haven't solved it. We haven't 
ended suffering. 
DB: 
But I think you have said that the reason we 
haven't solved it is because we are treating it as personal, 
or as in a small group . . .  and that is an illusion. 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
Now any attempt to deal with an illusion cannot 
solve anything. 
43 

JK: 
Thought cannot solve anything psychologically. 
DB: 
Because you can say that thought itself divides. 
Thought is limited and is unable to see that this suffer­
ing is all one. And in that way divides it up as mine and 
yours. 
JK: 
That's right. 
DB: 
And that creates illusion, which can only multi-
ply suffering. Now it seems to me that the statement 
that the suffering of mankind is one is inseparable from 
the statement that the consciousness of mankind is 
one. 
JK: 
Suffering is part of our consciousness. 
DB: 
But one doesn't get the feeling immediately that 
this suffering belongs to the whole of mankind, you see. 
JK: 
The world is me: I am the world. But we have 
divided it up into the British earth, and the French earth, 
and all the rest of it! 
DB: 
Do you mean by the world, the physical world, or 
the world of society? 
JK: 
The world of society, primarily the psychological 
world. 
DB: 
So we say the world of society, of human beings, 
is one, and when I say I am that world, what does it mean? 
JK: 
The world is not different from me. 
DB: 
The world and I are one. We are inseparable. 
44 

JK: 
Yes. And lhal is real medilalionא you musl feel lhis, 
nol just as a verbal statement: it is an actuality. I am my 
brother's keeper. 
DB: 
Many religions have said that. 
JK: 
That is just a verbal statement and they don't keep 
it; they don't do it in their hearts. 
DB: 
Perhaps some have done it, but in general it is not 
being done? 
JK: 
I don't know if anybody has done it. We human 
beings haven't done it. Our religions actually have pre­
vented it. 
DB: 
Because of division? Every religion has its own 
beliefs and its own organization. 
JK: 
Of course. Its own gods and its own saviors. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
So from that, is that intelligence actual? You un­
derstand my question? Or is it some kind of fanciful 
projection, hoping that it will solve our problems? It is 
not to me. It is an actuality. Because the ending of suffer­
ing means love. 
DB: 
Before we go on, let's clear up a point about 
"me." You see you said it is not to me. Now in some 
sense it seems that you are still defining an individual. Is 
that right? 
JK: 
Yes. I am using the word "I" as a means of com­
munication. 
45 

DB: 
But what does it mean ? In some way, let's say 
there may be two people, let's say "A, "  who is the way 
you see, and "B" who is not, eh? 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
So "A " says it is not-that seems to create a divi-
sion between "A" and "B." 
JK: 
That's right. But "B" creates the division. 
DB: 
Why? 
JK: 
What is the relationship between the two? 
DB: 
"B" is creating the division by saying, "I am a 
separate person" but it may confuse "B" further when 
"A" says "It's not that way to me"-right? 
JK: 
That is the whole point, isn't it, in relationship? 
You feel that you are not separate, and that you really 
have this sense of love and compassion, and I haven't 
got it. I haven't even perceived or gone into this ques­
tion. What is your relationship to me? You have a rela­
tionship with me but I haven't any relationship with 
you. 
DB: 
Well I think one could say that the person who 
hasn't seen is almost living a world of dreams, psycholog­
ically, and therefore the world of dreams is not related 
to the world of being awake. 
JK: 
That's right. 
DB: 
But the fellow who is awake can at least perhaps 
awaken the other fellow. 

JK: 
You are awake; I am not. Then your relationship 
with me is very clear. But I have no relationship with you; 
I cannot have one. I insist on division, and you don't. 
DB: 
Yes, we have to say that in some way the con­
sciousness of mankind has divided itself, it is all one but 
it has divided itself by thought. And that is why we are 
in this situation. 
JK: 
That is why. All the problems that humanity has 
now, psychologically, as well in other ways, are the result 
of thought. And we are pursuing the same pattern of 
thought, and thought will never solve any of these prob­
lems. So there is another kind of instrument, which is 
intelligence. 
DB: 
Well that opens up an entirely different subject. 
And you mentioned love as well. And compassion. 
JK: 
Without love and compassion there is no intelli­
gence. And you cannot be compassionate if you are at­
tached to some religion, if you are tied to a post like an 
animal. . . .  
DB: 
Yes as soon as the self is threatened, then it can-
not. . . .  
JK: 
You see, self hides behind . . .  
DB: 
. . .  other things. I mean, noble ideals. 
JK: 
Yes, it has immense capacity to hide itself. So what 
is the future of humanity? From what one observes it is 
leading to destruction. 
47 

DB: 
That is the way it seems to be going. 
JK: 
Very gloomy, grim, and dangerous. If one has chil-
dren, what is their future? To enter into all this? And go 
through the misery of it all. So education becomes ex­
traordinarily important. But now education is merely the 
accumulation of knowledge. 
DB: 
Every instrument that man has invented, dis­
covered, or developed has been turned toward destruc­
tion. 
JK: 
Absolutely. They are destroying nature; there are 
very few tigers now. 
DB: 
They are destroying forests and agricultural land. 
JK: 
Nobody seems to care. 
DB: 
Well, most people are just immersed in their 
plans to save themselves, but others have plans to save 
humanity. I think also there is a tendency toward despair, 
implicit in what is happening now, in that people don't 
think anything can be done. 
JK: 
Yes. And if they think something can be done they 
form little groups and little theories. 
DB: 
There are those who are very confident in what 
they are doing . . . .  
JK: 
Most prime ministers are very confident. They 
don't know what they are doing really! 
DB: 
Yes but then most people haven't much confi-
dence in what they are doing themselves. 

JK: 
I know. And if someone has tremendous confi-
dence I accept that confidence and go with them. 
What is the future of mankind, the future ofhumanity? 
I wonder if anybody is concerned with it? Or whether 
each person, each group, is only concerned with its own 
survival? 
DB: 
I think the first concern almost always has been 
with survival in either the individual or the group. That 
has been the history of mankind. 
JK: 
Therefore, perpetual wars, perpetual insecurity. 
DB: 
Yes, but this, as you said, is the result of thought, 
which makes the mistake on the basis of being incom­
plete of identifying the self with the group, and so on. 
JK: 
You happen to listen to all this. You agree to all 
this, you see the truth of all this. Those in power will not 
even listen to you. 
DB: 
No. 
JK: 
They are creating more and more misery, the 
world is becoming more and more dangerous. What is 
the point of our seeing something to be true, and what 
effect has it? 
DB: 
It seems to me that if we think in terms of the 
effects we are bringing in the very thing which is behind 
the trouble-time! Then the response would be to get in 
quickly and do something to change the course of events. 
JK: 
And therefore form a society, foundation, organi­
zation, and all the rest of it. 
49 

DB: 
But you see our mistake is to feel that we must 
think about something, althought that thought is incom­
plete. We don't really know what is going on, and people 
have made theories about it, but they don't know. 
JK: 
If that is the wrong question, then as a human 
being, who is mankind, what is my responsibility, apart 
from effect, and all the rest of it? 
DB: 
Yes, we can't look toward effects. But it is the 
same as with "A" and "B," that "A" sees, and "B" does 
not. 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
Now suppose "A" sees something and most of 
the rest of mankind does not. Then, it seems, one could 
say mankind is in a sense dreaming, asleep. 
JK: 
It is caught in illusion. 
DB: 
Illusion. And the point is that, if somebody sees 
something, his responsibility is to help awaken the others 
out of the illusions. 
JK: 
That is just it. This has been the problem. That 
is why the Buddhists have projected the idea of the 
Bodhisattva, who is the essence of all compassion, 
and is waiting to save humanity. It sounds nice. It is 
a happy feeling that there is somebody doing this. But 
in actuality we won't do anything that is not comfort­
able, satisfying, secure, both psychologically and phy­
sically. 
DB: 
That is basically the source of the illusion. 
50 

JK: 
How does one make others see all this? They 
haven't time, they haven't the energy, they haven't even 
the inclination. They want to be amused. How does one 
make "X" see this whole thing so clearly that he says, 
"All right, I have got it, I will work. And I see I am 
responsible," and all the rest of it. I think that is the 
tragedy of those who see and those who don't.

TWO 
J. KRISHNAMURTI: 
Are all the psychologists, as far as 
we can understand, really concerned with the future ofhu­
manity? Or are they concerned with the human being con­
forming to the present society? Or going beyond that? 
DAVID BOHM: 
I think that most psychologists evidently 
want the human being to conform to this society, but I 
think some are thinking of going beyond that, to trans­
form the consciousness of mankind. 
JK: 
Can the consciousness of mankind be changed 
through time? That is one of the questions we should 
discuss. 
DB: 
Yes. We have discussed it already and I think what 
came out was that with regard to consciousness time is 
not relevant, that it is a kind of illusion. We discussed the 
illusion of becoming. 
JK: 
We are saying, aren't we, that the evolution of 
consciousness is a fallacy. 
DB: 
As through time, yes. Though physical evolution 
is not. 
JK: 
Can we put it this way, much more simply? There 
is no psychological evolution, or evolution of the psyche? 
53 

DB: 
Yes. And, since the future of humanity depends 
on the psyche, it seems then that the future of humanity 
is not going to be determined through actions in time. 
And then that leaves us the question: what will we do? 
JK: 
Now let's proceed from there. Shouldn't we first 
distinguish between the brain and the mind? 
DB: 
Well that distinction has been made, and it is not 
clear. Now of course there are several views. One that the 
mind is just a function of the brain-that is the material­
ists' view. There is another view which says mind and 
brain are two different things. 
JK: 
Yes, I think they are two different things. 
DB: 
But there must be . . .  
JK: 
. . .  a contact between the two. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
A relationship between the two. 
DB: 
We don't necessarily imply any separation of the 
two. 
JK: 
No. First let's see the brain. I am really not an 
expert on the structure of the brain and all that kind of 
thing. But one can see within one, one can observe from 
one's own activity of the brain, that it is really like a 
computer which has been programmed, and remembers. 
DB: 
Certainly a large part of the activity is that way, 
but one is not certain that all of it is that way. 
54 

JK: 
No. And it is conditioned. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
Conditioned by past generations, by the society, 
by the newspapers, by the magazines, by all the activities 
and pressures from the outside. It is conditioned. 
DB: 
Now what do you mean by this conditioning? 
JK: 
The brain is programmed; it is made to conform 
to a certain pattern; it lives entirely on the past, modify­
ing itself with the present and going on. 
DB: 
We have agreed that some of this conditioning is 
useful and necessary. 
JK: 
Of course. 
DB: 
But the conditioning which determines the self, 
you know, which determines the . . .  
JK: 
. . .  the psyche. Let's call it for the moment the 
psyche. The self. 
DB: 
The self, the psyche, that conditioning is what you 
are talking about. That may not only be unnecessary but 
harmful. 
JK: 
Yes. The emphasis on the psyche, on giving im­
portance to the self, is creating great damage in the 
world, because it is separative and therefore it is con­
stantly in conflict, not only within itself but with the soci­
ety, with the family, and so on. 
55 

DB: 
Yes. And it is also in conflict with nature. 
JK: 
With nature, with the whole universe. 
DB: 
We have said that the conflict arose because . . .  
JK: 
. . .  of division . . . .  
DB: 
The division arising because thought is limited. 
Being based on this conditioning, on knowledge and 
memory, it is limited. 
JK: 
Yes. And experience is limited, therefore knowl­
edge is limited; memory and thought. And the very struc­
ture and nature of the psyche is the movement of 
thought. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
In time. 
DB: 
Yes. Now I would like to ask a question. You 
discussed the movement of thought but it doesn't seem 
clear to me what is moving. You see, if I discuss the 
movement of my hand, that is a real movement. It is clear 
what is meant. But now, when we discuss the movement 
of thought, it seems to me we are discussing something 
which is a kind of illusion, because you have said that 
becoming is the movement of thought. 
JK: 
That is what I mean, the movement is becoming. 
DB: 
But you are saying that movement is in some way 
illusory, aren't you? 
JK: 
Yes, of course. 

DB: 
It is ralher like lhe movemenl on lhe screen which 
is projecled from lhe camera. We say lhal there are no 
objecls moving across lhe screen, bul the only real move­
menl is the turning of lhe projector. Now can we say that 
there is a real movement in the brain which is projecting 
all this, which is the conditioning? 
JK: 
That is what we want to find out. Let's discuss 
that a bit. We both agree, or see, that the brain is condi­
lioned. 
DB: 
We mean that really it has been impressed physi­
cally, and chemically . . . .  
JK: 
And genetically, as well as psychologically. 
DB: 
What is the difference belween physically and 
psychologically? 
JK: 
Psychologically lhe brain is centred in the self.-
right? 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
And the constanl assertion of lhe self is the move­
ment, the conditioning, an illusion. 
DB: 
But there is some real movement happening in­
side. The brain, for example, is doing something. It has 
been conditioned physically and chemically. And some­
thing is happening physcially and chemically when we are 
lhinking of the self. 
JK: 
Are you asking whelher the brain and the self are 
two different things? 
57 

DB: 
No, I am saying that the self is the result of condi-
tioning the brain. 
JK: 
Yes. The self is conditioning the brain. 
DB: 
But does the self exist? 
JK: 
No. 
DB: 
But the conditioning of the brain, as I see it, is the 
involvement with an illusion which we call the self. 
JK: 
That's right. Can that conditioning be dissipated? 
That's the whole question. 
DB: 
It really has to be dissipated in some physical and 
chemical and neuro-physiological sense. 
JK: 
Yes. 
· 
DB: 
Now the first reaction of any scientific person 
would be that it looks unlikely that we could dissipate it 
by the sort of thing we are doing. You see, some scientists 
might feel that maybe we will discover drugs or new 
genetic changes or deep knowledge of the structure of 
the brain. In that way we could perhaps help to do some­
thing. I think that idea might be current among some 
people. 
JK: 
Will that change human behavior? 
DB: 
Why not? I think some people believe it might. 
JK: 
Wait a minute. That is the whole point. It might, 
which means in the future. 
DB: 
Yes, it would take time to discover all this. 
JK: 
In the meantime man is going to destroy himself. 

DB: 
They might hope that he will manage to discover 
it in time. They could also criticize what we are doing, 
saying what good can it do? You see, it doesn't seem to 
affect anybody, and certainly not in time to make a big 
difference. 
JK: 
We two are very clear about it. In what way does 
it affect humanity? 
DB: 
Will it really affect mankind in time to save . . .  
JK: 
Obviously not. 
DB: 
Then why should we be doing it? 
JK: 
Because this is the right thing to do. Indepen­
dently. It has nothing to do with reward and punishment. 
DB: 
Nor with goals. We do the right thing even 
though we don't know what the outcome will be? 
JK: 
That's right. 
DB: 
Are you saying there is no other way? 
JK: 
We are saying there is no other way; that's right. 
DB: 
Well we should make that clear. For example, 
some psychologists would feel that, by enquiring into 
this sort of thing, we could bring about an evolutionary 
transformation of consciousness. 
JK: 
We come back to the point that through time we 
hope to change consciousness. We question that. 
DB: 
We have questioned that, and are saying that 
through time, inevitably we are all caught in becoming 
and illusion, and we will not know what we are doing. 

JK: 
That's right. 
DB: 
Now could we say that the same thing would hold 
even for those scientists who are trying lo do it physically 
and chemically or structurally; that they themselves are 
still caught in this, and through time they are caught in 
trying lo become heller? 
JK: 
Yes. The experimencalisls and the psychologists 
and ourselves are all trying lo become something. 
DB: 
Yes, Chough it may not seem obvious al first. It 
may seem that the scientists are really just disinterested, 
unbiased observers, working on the problem. But under­
neath one feels chere is the desire lo become heller on 
the part of the person who is enquiring in that way. 
JK: 
To become. Of course. 
DB: 
He is nol free of that. 
JK: 
Thal is just it. 
DB: 
And that desire will give rise to self-deception and 
illusion, and so on. 
JK: 
So where are we now? Any form of becoming is 
an illusion, and becoming implies time, time for the 
psyche lo change. But we are saying that time is nol 
necessary. 
DB: 
Now chat ties up with the other question of the 
mind and the brain. The brain is an activity in time, as a 
physical, chemical, complex process. 
JK: 
I think the mind is separate from the brain. 
60 

DB: 
What does separate mean? Are they in contact? 
JK: 
Separate in the sense that the brain is conditioned 
and the mind is not. 
DB: 
Let's say the mind has a certain independence of 
the brain. Even if the brain is conditioned . . .  
JK: 
. . .  the other is not. 
DB: 
It need not be . . .  
JK: 
. . .  conditioned. 
DB: 
On what basis do you say that? 
JK: 
Let's not begin on what basis I say that. 
DB: 
Well, what makes you say it? 
JK: 
As long as the brain is conditioned, it is not free. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
And the mind is free. 
DB: 
Yes, that is what you are saying. But you see, the 
brain not being free means that it is not free to enquire 
in an unbiased way. 
JK: 
I will go into it. Let's enquire what is freedom? 
Freedom to enquire, freedom to investigate. It is only in 
freedom that there is deep insight. 
DB: 
Yes, that's clear, because if you are not free to 
enquire, or if you are biased, then you are limited, in an 
arbitrary way. 
6 1  

JK: 
So as long as the brain is conditioned its relation-
ship to the mind is limited. 
DB: 
We have the relationship of the brain to the mind, 
and also the other way round. 
JK: 
Yes. But the mind being free has a relationship to 
the brain. 
DB: 
Yes. Now we say the mind is free, in some sense, 
not subject to the conditioning of the brain. 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
What is the nature of the mind? Is the mind 
located inside the body, or is it in the brain? 
JK: 
No, it is nothing to do with the body or the brain. 
DB: 
Has it to do with space or time? 
JK: 
Space-now wait a minute! It has to do with space 
and silence. These are the two factors of the . . .  
DB: 
But not time? 
JK: 
Not time. Time belongs to the brain. 
DB: 
You say space and silence; now what kind of 
space? It is not the space in which we see life moving. 
JK: 
Space. Let's look round at it the other way. 
Thought can invent space. 
DB: 
In addition, we have the space that we see. But 
thought can invent all kinds of space. 
JK: 
And space from here to there. 
DB: 
Yes, the space through which we move is that way. 

JK: 
Space also between two noises, two sounds. 
DB : 
They call that the interval, the interval between 
two sounds. 
JK: 
Yes, the interval between two noises. Two 
thoughts. Two notes. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
Space between two people. 
DB: 
Space between the walls. 
JK: 
And so on. But that kind of space is not the space 
of the mind. 
DB: 
You say it is not limited? 
JK: 
That's right. But I didn't want to use the word 
limited. 
DB: 
But it is implied. That kind of space is not in the 
nature of being bounded by something. 
JK: 
No, it is not bounded by the psyche. 
DB: 
But is it bounded by anything? 
JK: 
No. So can the brain, with all its cells conditioned, 
can those cells radically change? 
DB: 
We have often discussed this. It is not certain that 
all the cells are conditioned. For example, some people 
think that only some or a small part of the cells are being 
used, and that the others are just inactive, dormant. 
JK: 
Hardly used at all, or just touched occasionally. 

DB: 
Just touched occasionally. But those cells that are 
conditioned, whatever they may be, evidently dominate 
consciousness now. 
JK: 
Yes. Can those cells be changed? 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
We are saying that they can, through insight; in­
sight being out of time, not the result of remembrance, 
not an intuition, nor desire, nor hope. It is nothing to do 
with any time and thought. 
DB: 
Yes. Now is insight of the mind? Is it of the nature 
of mind ? An activity of mind? 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
Therefore you are saying that mind can act in the 
matter of the brain. 
JK: 
Yes, we said that earlier. 
DB: 
But, you see, this point, how mind is able to act 
in matter, is difficult. 
JK: 
It is able to act on the brain. For instance, take any 
crisis, or problem. The root meaning of problem is, as 
you know, "something thrown at you." And we meet it 
with all the remembrance of the past, with a bias and so 
on. And therefore the problem multiplies itself. You may 
solve one problem, but in the very solution of one partic­
ular problem, other problems arise, as happens in poli­
tics, and so on. Now to approach the problem, or to have 
perception of it without any past memories and thoughts 
interfering or projecting . . .  

DB: 
That implies that perception also is ofthe mind . . . .  
JK: 
Yes, that's right. 
DB: 
Are you saying that the brain is a kind of instru-
ment of the mind? 
JK: 
An instrument of the mind when the brain is not 
self-centered. 
DB: 
All the conditioning may be thought of as the 
brain exciting itself, and keeping itself going just from 
the program. This occupies all of its capacities. 
JK: 
All our days, yes. 
DB: 
The brain is rather like a radio receiver which 
can generate its own noise, but would not pick up a sig­
nal. 
JK: 
Not quite. Let's go into this a little. Experience 
is always limited. I may blow up that experience into 
something fantastic, and then set up a shop to sell my 
experience, but that experience is limited. And so 
knowledge is always limited. And this knowledge is 
operating in the brain. This knowledge is the brain. 
And thought is also pan of the brain, and thought is 
limited. So the brain is operating in a very, very small 
area. 
DB: 
Yes. What prevents it from operating in a broader 
area? In an unlimited area? 
JK: 
Thought. 
DB: 
But it seems to me the brain is running on its own, 
from its own program. 

JK: 
Yes, like a computer. 
DB: 
Essentially, what you are asking is that the brain 
should really be responding to the mind. 
JK: 
It can only respond if it is free from the limited; 
from thought, which is limited. 
DB: 
So the program does not then dominate it. You 
see we are still going to need that program. 
JK: 
Of course. We need it for . . .  
DB: 
. . .  for many things. But is intelligence from the 
mind? 
JK: 
Yes, intelligence is the mind. 
DB: 
Is the mind. 
JK: 
We must go into something else. Because compas­
sion is related to intelligence, there is no intelligence 
without compassion. And compassion can only be, when 
there is love which is completely free from all remem­
brances, personal jealousies, and so on. 
DB: 
Is all that compassion, love, also of the mind? 
JK: 
Of the mind. You cannot be compassionate if you 
are attached to any particular experience, or any particu­
lar ideal. 
DB: 
Yes, that is again the program. 
JK: 
Yes. For instance, there are those people who go 
out to various poverty-ridden countries and work, work, 
work. And they call that compassion. But they are at-
66 

tached, or tied to a particular form of religious belief, and 
therefore their action is merely pity or sympathy. It is not 
compassion. 
DB: 
Yes, I understand that we have here two things 
which can be somewhat independent. There is the brain 
and the mind, though they make contact. Then we say 
that intelligence and compassion come from beyond the 
brain. Now I would like to go into the question of how 
they are making contact. 
JK: 
Ah! Contact can only exist between the mind and 
the brain when the brain is quiet. 
DB: 
Yes, that is the requirement for making it. The 
brain has got be be quiet. 
JK: 
Quiet is not a trained quietness. Not a self-con­
scious, meditative, desire for silence. It is a natural out­
come of understanding one's own conditioning. 
DB: 
And one can see that if the brain is quiet it could 
listen to something deeper? 
JK : 
That's right. Then if it is quiet it is related to the 
mind. Then the mind can function through the brain. 
DB: 
I think that it would help if we could see with 
regard to the brain whether it has any activity which is 
beyond thought. You see, for example, one could ask, is 
awareness part of the function of the brain? 
JK: 
As long as it is awareness in which there is no 
choice. 

DB: 
I think that may cause difficulty. What is wrong 
with choice? 
JK: 
Choice means confusion. 
DB: 
That is not obvious . . . .  
JK: 
After all, you have to choose between two things. 
DB: 
I could choose whether I will buy one thing or 
another. 
JK: 
Yes, I can choose between this table and that table. 
DB: 
I choose the colors when I buy the table. That 
need not be confused. If I choose which color I want, I 
don't see why that has to be confused. 
JK: 
There is nothing wrong. There is no confusion 
there. 
DB: 
But it seems to me that the choice about the psy-
che is where the confusion is. 
JK: 
That's all; we are talking of the psyche that 
chooses. 
DB: 
That chooses to become. 
JK: 
Yes. Chooses to become. And choice exists where 
there is confusion. 
DB: 
Are you saying that out of confusion the psyche 
makes a choice to become one thing or another? Being 
confused, it tries to become something better? 
JK: 
And choice implies a duality. 
68 

DB: 
But it seems at first sight that we have another 
duality which you have introduced, which is the mind and 
the brain. 
JK: 
No, that is not a duality. 
DB: 
What is the difference? 
JK: 
Let's take a very simple example. Human beings 
are violent, and nonviolence has been projected by 
thought. That is the duality-the the fact, and the non­
fact. 
DB: 
You are saying there is a duality between a fact, 
and some mere projection which the mind makes. 
JK: 
The ideal and the fact. 
DB: 
The ideal is non-real, and the fact is real. 
JK: 
That's it. The ideal is not actual. 
DB: 
Yes. Now then you say the division of those is 
duality. Why do you give it that name? 
JK: 
Because they are divided. 
DB: 
Well at least they appear to be divided. 
JK: 
Divided, and we are struggling. For instance, all 
the totalitarian communist ideals, and the democratic 
ideals, are the outcome of thought which is limited, and 
this is creating havoc in the world. 
DB: 
So there is a division which has been brought in. 
But I think we were discussing in terms of dividing some-
69 

thing which cannot be divided. Of trying to divide the 
psyche. 
JK: 
That's right. Violence cannot be divided into non­
violence. 
DB: 
And the psyche cannot be divided into violence 
and nonviolence. Right? 
JK: 
It is what it is. 
DB: 
It is what it is; so, if it is violent, it can't be divided 
into a violent and a nonviolent part. 
JK: 
So can we remain with "what is," not with "what 
should be," "what must be," not invent ideals, and so 
on? 
DB: 
Yes, but could we return to the question of the 
mind and the brain? Now we are saying that is not a 
division. 
JK: 
Oh no, that is not a division. 
DB: 
They are in contact, is that right? 
JK: 
We said, there is contact between the mind and the 
brain when the brain is silent and has space. 
DB: 
So we are saying that although they are in contact 
and not divided at all, the mind can still have a certain 
independence of the conditioning of the brain. 
JK: 
Now let's be careful! Suppose my brain is condi­
tioned, for example, programmed as a Hindu, and my 
whole life and action are conditioned by the idea that I 

am a Hindu. Mind obviously has no relationship with that 
conditioning. 
DB: 
You are using the word mind; not "my " mind. 
JK: 
Mind. It is not "mine." 
DB: 
It is universal or general. 
JK: 
Yes. And it is not "my" brain either. 
DB: 
No, but there is a particular brain, this brain or 
that brain. Would you say that there is a particular mind? 
JK: 
No. 
DB: 
That is an important difference. You are saying 
mind is really universal. 
JK: 
Mind is universal-if you can use that ugly word. 
DB: 
Unlimited and undivided. 
JK: 
It is unpolluted; not polluted by thought. 
DB: 
But I think for most people there will be difficulty 
in saying how we know anything about this mind. We 
only know that my mind is the first feeling-right? 
JK: 
You cannot call it your mind. You only have your 
brain, which is conditioned. You can't say, "It is my 
mind." 
DB: 
But whatever is going on inside I feel is mine, and 
it is very different from what is going on inside somebody 
else. 
JK: 
No, I question whether it is different. 
7 1  

DB: 
Al leasl il seems differenl. 
JK: 
Yes. I queslion whelher il is differenl, whal is going 
on inside me as a human being, and you as another human 
being. We bolh go lhrough all kinds of problems: suffer­
ing, fear, anxiely, loneliness, and so on. We have our 
dogmas, beliefs, superslitions. And everybody has lhis. 
DB: 
We can say il is all very similar, but it seems as if 
each one of us is isolated from the other. 
JK: 
By thought. My lhoughl has created the belief thal 
I am differenl from you, because my body is differenl 
from yours, my face is different from yours. We extend 
that same thing inlo lhe psychological area. 
DB: 
But now if we said that division is an illusion, 
perhaps? 
JK: 
No, nol perhaps! ll is. 
DB: 
ll is an illusion. All right. Although it is nol obvi­
ous when a person firsl looks at il. 
JK: 
Of course. 
DB: 
In realily even brain is not divided, because we 
are saying lhal we are all not only basically similar but 
really connected. And lhen we say beyond all thal is 
mind, which has no division at all. 
JK: 
It is uncondilioned. 
DB: 
Yes, it would almost seem to imply, then, that in 
so far as a person feels he is a separate being he has very 
little contact wilh mind. 

JK: 
Quite right. That is what we said. 
DB: 
No mind. 
JK: 
That is why it is very important to understand not 
the mind but our conditioning. And whether our condi­
tioning, human conditioning, can ever be dissolved. That 
is the real issue. 
DB: 
Yes. I think we still want to understand the mean­
ing of what is being said. You see, we have a mind that 
is universal; that is in some kind of space, you say, or is 
it its own space? 
JK: 
It is not in me or in my brain. 
DB: 
But it has a space. 
JK: 
It is, it lives in space and silence. 
DB: 
It lives in a space and silence, but it is the space 
of the mind. It is not a space like this space? 
JK: 
No. That is why we said space is not invented by 
thought. 
DB: 
Yes, now is it possible then to perceive this space 
when the mind is silent, to be in contact with it? 
JK: 
Not perceive. Let's see. You are asking whether 
the mind can be perceived by the brain. 
DB: 
Or at least the brain somehow be aware . . . an 
awareness, a sense. 
JK: 
We are saying, yes; through meditation. You may 
not like to use that word. 
73 

DB: 
I don't mind. 
JK: 
You see, the difficulty is that when you use the 
word "meditation" it is generally understood that there 
is always a meditator meditating. Real meditation is an 
unconscious process, not a conscious process. 
DB: 
How then are you able to say that meditation 
takes place if it is unconscious? 
JK: 
It is taking place when the brain is quiet. 
DB: 
You mean by consciousness all the movement of 
thought? Feeling, desire, will, and all that goes with it? 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
There is a kind of awareness still, isn't there? 
JK: 
Oh yes. It depends what you call awareness. 
Awareness of what? 
DB: 
Possibly awareness of something deeper, I don't 
know. 
JK: 
Again, when you use the word "deeper," it is a 
measurement. I wouldn't use that. 
DB: 
Well, let's not use that. But, you see, there is a 
kind of unconsciousness which we are simply not aware 
of at all. A person may be unconscious of some of his 
problems, conflicts. 
JK: 
Let's go at it a bit more. If I do something con-
sciously, it is the activity of thought. 
DB: 
Yes, it is thought reflecting on itself. 
74 

JK: 
Right, it is the activity of thought. Now if I con­
sciously meditate, practise, do all that, which I call non­
sense, then I am making the brain conform to another 
series of patterns. 
DB: 
Yes, it is more becoming. 
JK: 
More becoming, that's right. 
DB: 
You are trying to become better. 
JK: 
There is no illumination by becoming. One can't 
be illumed, if I can use that word, by saying that one is 
going to be some sort of guru. 
DB: 
But it seems very difficult to communicate some-
thing which is not conscious. 
JK: 
That's it. That's the difficulty. 
DB: 
It is not just being knocked out. If a person is 
unconscious, he is knocked out, but you don't mean that. 
JK: 
Of course not! 
DB: 
Or under anesthetic or . 
JK: 
No, let's put it this way: conscious meditation, con­
scious activity to control thought, to free oneself from 
conditioning, is not freedom. 
DB: 
Yes, I think that is clear, but it becomes very un-
clear how to communicate something else. 
JK: 
Wait a minute. You want to discuss what lies be-
yond thought. 
75 

DB: 
Or when thought is silent. 
JK: 
Quiet, silent. What words would you use? 
DB: 
Well, I suggested the word awareness. What 
about the word attention? 
JK: 
Attention for me is better. Would you say, in atten­
tion there is no center as the me? 
DB: 
Well, not in the kind of attention you are discuss­
ing. There is the usual kind, where we pay attention 
because of what interests us. 
JK: 
Attention is not concentration. 
DB: 
We are discussing a kind of attention without this 
"me" present, which is not the activity of the condition­
ing. 
JK: 
Not the activity of thought. In attention, thought 
has no place. 
DB: 
Yes, but could we say more? What do you mean 
by attention? Now would the derivation of the word be 
of any use? It means stretching the mind-would that 
help? 
JK: 
No. Would it help if we say concentration is not 
attention? Effort is not attention. When I make an effort 
to attend it is not attention. Attention can only come into 
being when the self is not. 
DB: 
Yes, but that is going to get us in a circle, because 
usually we are starting when the self is. 

JK: 
No, I used the word carefully. Meditation means 
measure. 
DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
As long as there is measurement, which is becom-
ing, there is no meditation. Let's put it that way. 
DB: 
Yes. We can discuss when there is not medita-
tion. 
JK: 
That's right. Through negation the other is. 
DB: 
Because if we succeed in negating the whole ac­
tivity of what is not meditation, the meditation will be 
there. 
JK: 
That's right. 
DB: 
That which is not meditation, but which we think 
is meditation. 
JK: 
Yes, that is very clear. As long as there is measure­
ment, which is the becoming, which is the process of 
thought, meditation or silence cannot be. 
DB: 
Is this undirected attention mind? 
JK: 
Attention is of the mind. 
DB: 
Well, it contacts the brain, doesn't it? 
JK: 
Yes. As long as the brain is silent, the other has 
contact. 
DB: 
That is, this true attention has contact with the 
brain, when the brain is silent. 
77 

JK: 
Silent, and has space. 
DB: 
What is the space? 
JK: 
The brain has no space now, because it is con­
cerned with itself, it is programmed, it is self-centered 
and it is limited. 
DB: 
Yes. The mind is in its space; now does the brain 
have its space too? Limited space? 
JK: 
Of course. Thought has a limited space. 
DB: 
But when thought is absent, does the brain have 
its space? 
JK: 
Yes. The brain has space. 
DB: 
Unlimited? 
JK: 
No. It is only mind that has unlimited space. 
My brain can be quiet over a problem which I have 
thought about, and I suddenly say, "Well I won't think 
anymore about it," and there is a certain amount of 
space. In that space you solve' the problem. 
DB: 
Now if the brain is silent, if it is not thinking of 
a problem, then still the space is limited, but it is open 
to . . .  
JK: 
. . . to the other. 
DB: 
. . .  to the attention. Would you say that, through 
attention, or in attention, the mind is contacting the 
brain? 
JK: 
When the brain is not inattentive. 

DB: 
So whal happens lo the brain? 
JK: 
Whal happens Lo lhe brain which is lo act? Let's 
get it clear. We said intelligence is born oul of compas­
sion and love. That intelligence operates when the brain 
is quiet. 
DB: 
Yes. Does it operate through attention? 
JK: 
Of course. 
DB: 
So attention seems lo be lhe contact. 
JK: 
Naturally. We said loo Lhal attention can only be, 
when the self is not. 
DB: 
Now you say thal love and compassion are the 
ground, and out of this comes the intelligence, through 
attention. 
JK: 
Yes, it functions through the brain. 
DB: 
So there are two questions: one is the nature of 
.this intelligence, and the second is, what does it do to the 
brain? 
JK: 
Yes, let's see. We must again approach it nega­
tively. Love is not jealousy, and all that. Love is not 
personal, but it can be personal. 
DB: 
Then it is not what you are talking about. 
JK: 
Love is not my country, your country, or "I love my 
god." It is not that. 
DB: 
If it is from universal mind . . . .  
79 

JK: 
That 1s why I say love has no relationship to 
thought. 
DB: 
And it does not start in the particular brain, does 
not originate in the particular brain. 
JK: 
When there is that love, out of it there is compas­
sion and there is intelligence. 
DB: 
Is this intelligence able to understand deeply? 
JK: 
No, not "understand." 
DB: 
What does it do? Does it perceive? 
JK: 
Through perception it acts. 
DB: 
Perception of what? 
JK: 
Now let's discuss perception. There can be per-
ception only when it is not tinged by thought. When 
there is no interference from the movement of thought, 
there is perception, which is direct insight into a prob­
lem, or into human complexities. 
DB: 
Now this perception originates in the mind? 
JK: 
Does the perception originate in the mind? Yes. 
When the brain is quiet. 
DB: 
But we use the words perception and intelligence, 
now how are they related, or what is their difference? 
JK: 
The difference between perception and intelli­
gence? 
DB: 
Yes. 
80 

JK: 
None. 
DB: 
So we can say intelligence is perception. 
JK: 
Yes, that's right. 
DB: 
Intelligence is perception of "what is"? And 
through attention there is contact. 
JK: 
Let's take a problem, then it is easier to under­
stand. Take the problem of suffering. Human beings 
have suffered endlessly, through wars, through physical 
disease, and through wrong relationship with each other. 
Now can that end? 
DB: 
I would say the difficulty of ending that is that it 
1s on the program. We are conditioned to this whole 
thing. 
JK: 
Yes. Now that has been going on for centuries. 
DB: 
So it is very deep. 
JK: 
Very, very deep. Now can that suffering end? 
DB: 
It cannot end by an action of the brain. 
JK: 
By thought. 
DB: 
Because the brain is caught in suffering, and it 
cannot take an action to end its own suffering. 
JK: 
Of course it cannot. That is why thought cannot 
end it. Thought has created it. 
DB: 
Yes, thought hc.s created it, and anyway it is un­
able to get hold of it. 

JK: 
Thought has created the wars, the misery, the con­
fusion. And thought has become prominent in human 
relationship. 
DB: 
Yes, but I think people might agree with that and 
still think that just as thought can do bad things, it can 
do good things. 
JK: 
No, thought cannot do good or bad. It is thought, 
limited. 
DB: 
Thought cannot get hold of this suffering. That 
is, this suffering being in the physical and chemical con­
ditioning of the brain, thought has no way of even know­
ing what it is. 
JK: 
I mean, I lose my son and I am . . . .  
DB: 
Yes, but by thinking, I don't know what is going 
on inside me. I can't change the suffering inside because 
thinking will not show me what it is. Now you are saying 
intelligence is perception. 
JK: 
But we are asking, can suffering end? That is the 
problem. 
DB: 
Yes, and it is clear that thinking cannot end it. 
JK: 
Thought cannot do it. That is the point. If I have 
an insight into it . . .  
DB: 
Now this insight will be through the action of the 
mind; through intelligence and attention. 
JK: 
When there is that insight, intelligence wipes away 
suffering. 

DB: 
You are saying, therefore, that there is a contact 
from mind to matter which removes the whole physical, 
chemical structure that keeps us going on with suffering. 
JK: 
That's right. In that ending there is a mutation in 
the brain cells. 
DB: 
Yes, and that mutation just wipes out the whole 
structure that makes you suffer. 
JK: 
That's right. Therefore it is as if l have been going 
along a certain tradition; I suddenly change that tradition 
and there is a change in the whole brain, which has been 
going North. Now it goes East. 
DB: 
Of course this is a radical notion from the point 
of view of traditional ideas in science, because, if we 
accept that mind is different from matter, then people 
would find it hard to say that mind would actually . . . 
JK: 
Would you put it that mind is pure energy? 
DB: 
Well, we could put it that way, but matter is en-
ergy too. 
JK: 
But matter is limited; thought is limited. 
DB: 
But we are saying that the pure energy of mind is 
able to reach into the limited energy of matter? 
JK: 
Yes, that's right. And change the limitation. 
DB: 
Remove some of the limitation. 
JK: 
When there is a deep issue, problem, or challenge 
which you are facing. 

DB: 
We could also add that all the traditional ways of 
trying to do this cannot work. . . . 
JK: 
They haven't worked. 
DB: 
Well, that is not enough. We have to say, because 
people still might hope it could, that it cannot, actu­
ally. 
JK: 
It cannot. 
DB: 
Because thought cannot get at its own physical, 
chemical basis in the cells, and do anything about those 
cells. 
JK: 
Yes. Thought cannot bring about a change in it­
self. 
DB: 
And yet practically everything that mankind has 
been trying to do is based on thought. There is a limited 
area, of course, where that is all right, but we cannot do 
anything about the future of humanity from that usual 
approach. 
JK: 
When one listens to the politicians, who are so 
very active in the world, they are creating problem after 
problem, and to them thought, ideals are the most im­
portant things. 
DB: 
Generally speaking nobody knows of anything 
else. 
JK: 
Exactly. We are saymg that the old instrument 
which is thought is worn out, except in certain areas. 

DB: 
It never was adequate, except in those areas. 
JK: 
Of course. 
DB: 
And, as far as history goes, man has always been 
in trouble. 
JK: 
Man has always been in trouble, in turmoil, in fear. 
And facing all the confusion of the world, can there be 
a solution to all this? 
DB: 
That comes back to the question I would like to 
repeat. It seems there are a few people who are talking 
about it, and think perhaps they know, or perhaps they 
meditate, and so on. But how is that going to affect this 
vast current of mankind? 
JK: 
Probably very little. But why will it affect this? It 
might, or it might not. But then one puts that question: 
what is the use of it? 
DB: 
Yes, that's the point. I think there is an instinctive 
feeling that makes one put the question. 
JK: 
But I think that is the wrong question. 
DB: 
You see, the first instinct is to say, "What can we 
do to stop this tremendous catastrophe?" 
JK: 
Yes. But if each one of us, whoever listens, sees the 
truth that thought, in its activity both externally and in­
wardly, has created a terrible mess, great suffering, then 
one must inevitably ask is there an ending to all this? If 
thought cannot end it, what will? 
85 

DB: 
Yes. 
JK: 
What is the new instrument that will put an end to 
all this misery? You see, there is a new instrument which 
is the mind, which is intelligence. But the difficulty is also 
that people won't listen to all this. Both the scientists and 
the ordinary laymen like us, have come to definite con­
clusions, and they won't listen. 
DB: 
Yes, well, that is what I had in mind when I said 
that a few people don't seem to have much effect. 
JK: 
Of course. I think, after all, few people have 
changed the world, whether good or bad-but that is not 
the point. Hitler; and also the communists have changed 
it, but they have gone to the same pattern again. Physical 
revolution has never psychologically changed the human 
state. 
DB: 
Do you think it is possible that a certain number 
of brains coming in contact with mind in this way will be 
able to have an effect on mankind, which is beyond just 
the immediate, obvious effect of their communication? 
JK: 
Yes, that's right. But how do you convey this sub­
tle and very complex issue to a person who is steeped in 
tradition, who is conditioned, and won't even take time 
to listen, to consider? 
DB: 
Well, that is the question. You see, you could say 
that this conditioning cannot be absolute; cannot be an 
absolute block, or else there would be no way out at all. 
But the conditioning may be thought to have some sort 
of permeability. 
86 

JK: 
I mean, after all, the pope won't listen to us, but 
the pope has tremendous influence. 
DB: 
Is it possible that every person has something he 
can listen to, if it could be found? 
JK: 
If he has a little patience. Who will listen? The 
politicians won't listen. The idealists won't listen. The 
totalitarians won't listen. The deeply steeped religious 
people won't listen. So perhaps a so-called ignorant per­
son, not highly educated or conditioned in his profes­
sional career, or by money, the poor man who says, "I am 
suffering, please let's end that." . . .  
DB: 
But he doesn't listen either, you see. He wants to 
get a job. 
JK: 
Of course. He says, "Feed me first." We have been 
through all this for the last sixty years. The poor man 
won't listen, the rich man won't listen, the learned won't 
listen, and the deeply dogmatic religious believers don't 
listen. So perhaps it is like a wave in the world; it might 
catch somebody. I think it is a wrong question to say, 
does it affect? 
DB: 
Yes, all right. We will say that that brings in time, 
and that is becoming. It brings in the psyche in the pro­
cess of becoming again. 
JK: 
Yes. But if you say . . .  it must affect mankind . . .  
DB: 
Are you proposing that it affects mankind through 
the mind directly, rather than through . .  

JK: 
Yes. It may not show immediately in action. 
׎B: 
You said that the mind is universal, and is not 
located in our ordinary space, is not separate . . . .  
JK: 
Yes, but there is a danger in saying this, that the 
mind is universal. That is what some people say of the 
mind, and it has become a tradition. 
DB: 
One can turn it into an idea, of course. 
JK: 
That is just the danger of it; that is what I am 
saymg. 
DB: 
Yes. But really the question is, we have to come 
directly in contact with this to make it real. Right? 
JK: 
That's it. We can only come into contact with it 
when the self is not. To put it very simply, when the self 
is not, there is beauty, silence, space; then that intelli­
gence, which is born of compassion, operates through 
the brain. It is very simple. 
DB: 
Yes. Would it be worth discussing the self, since 
the self is widely active? 
JK: 
I know. That is our long tradition of many, many 
centuries. 
DB: 
Is there some aspect of meditation which can 
be helpful here when the self is acting? You see, sup­
pose a person says, "all right, I am caught in the self, 
but I want to get out. But I want to know what I shall 
do?" 
]K: 
No.

DB: 
I won't use the words "what shall I do?" But what 
do you say? 
JK: 
That is very simple. Is the observer different from 
the observed? 
DB: 
Well, suppose we say, "Yes, it appears to be diff-
erent"; then what? 
JK: 
Is that an idea or an actuality? 
DB: 
What do you mean? 
JK: 
Actuality is when there is no division between the 
thinker and the thought. 
DB: 
But suppose I say, ordinarily one feels that the 
observer is different from the observed. We begin 
there. 
JK: 
We begin there. I'll show you. Look at it. Are you 
different from your anger, from your envy, from your 
suffering? You are not. 
DB: 
At first sight it appears that I am, that I might try 
to control it. 
JK: 
You are that. 
DB: 
Yes, but how will I see that I am that? 
JK: 
You are your name. You are your form, your body. 
You are the reactions and actions. You are the belief, the 
fear, the suffering and pleasure. You are all that. 
DB: 
But the first experience is that I am here first, and 
that those are properties of me; they are my qualities 
89 

which I can either have or not have. I might be angry, or 
not angry, I might have this belief, or that belief. 
JK: 
Contradictory. You are all that. 
DB: 
But you see, it is not obvious. When you say I am 
that, do you mean that I am that, and cannot be other­
wise? 
JK : 
No. At present you are that. It can be totally other-
wise. 
DB: 
All right. So I am all that. You are telling me that 
this unbiased observer is the same as the anger he is 
looking at? 
JK: 
Of course. Just as I analyze myself, and the an-
alyzer is the analyzed. 
DB: 
Yes. He is biased by what he analyzes. 
JK : 
Yes. 
DB: 
So, if l watch anger for a while, I can see that I am 
very biased by the anger, so at some stage I say that I am 
one with that anger? 
JK: 
No, not "I am one with it"; I am it. 
DB: 
That anger and I are the same? 
JK: 
Yes. The observer is the observed. And when that 
actuality exists you have really eliminated altogether con­
flict. Conflict exists when I am separate from my quality. 
DB: 
Yes, that is because if I believe myself to be sepa­
rate, then I can try to change it, but since I am that, it 
go 

is trying to change itself and remain itself at the same 
time. 
JK: 
Yes, that's right. But when the quality is me, the 
division has ended. Right? 
DB: 
When I see that the quality is me, then there is no 
point in trying to change. 
JK: 
No. When there is division and the quality is not 
me, in that there is conflict, either suppression or escape, 
and so on, which is a wastage of energy. When that qual­
ity is me, all that energy which has been wasted is there 
to look, to observe. 
DB: 
But why does it make such a difference to have 
that quality being me? 
JK: 
It makes a difference when there is no division 
between the quality and me. 
DB: 
Well then there is no perception of a difference . . . .  
JK: 
That's right. Put it round differently. 
DB: 
. . .  the mind does not try to fight itself. 
JK: 
Yes, yes. It is so. 
DB: 
If there is an illusion of a difference, the mind 
must be compelled to fight against itself. 
JK: 
The brain. 
DB: 
The brain fights against itself. 
JK: 
That's right. 
9 1  

DB: 
On the other hand, when there is no illusion of a 
difference, the brain just stops fighting. 
JK: 
And therefore you have tremendous energy. 
DB: 
The brain's natural energy is released? 
JK: 
Yes. And energy means attention. 
DB: 
The energy of the brain allows for attention . . . .  
JK: 
For that thing to dissolve. 
DB: 
Yes, but wait a minute. We said before that atten-
tion was a contact of the mind and the brain. 
JK: 
Yes. 
DB: 
The brain must be in a state of high energy to 
allow that contact. 
JK: 
That's right. 
DB: 
I mean, a brain which is low energy cannot allow 
that contact. 
JK: 
Of course not. But most of us are low energy be-
cause we are so conditioned. 
DB: 
Well essentially you are saying that this is the way 
to start. 
JK: 
Yes, start simply. Start with "what is," what I am. 
Self-knowledge is so important. It is not an accumulated 
process of knowledge, which one then looks at; it is a 
constant learning about oneself. 
92 

DB: 
If you call it self-knowledge, then it is not knowl­
edge of the kind we talked about before, which is condi­
tioning. 
JK: 
That's right. Knowledge conditions. 
DB: 
But you are saying that self-knowledge of this 
kind is not conditioning. But why do you call it knowl­
edge? Is it a different kind of knowledge? 
JK: 
Yes. Knowledge conditions. 
DB: 
Yes, but now you have this self-knowledge. 
JK: 
Which is to know and to comprehend oneself. To 
understand oneself is such a subtle, complex thing. It is 
living. 
DB: 
Essentially knowing yourself in the very moment 
in which things are happening. 
JK: 
Yes, to know what is happening. 
DB: 
Rather than store it up in memory. 
JK: 
Of course. Through reactions, I begin to discover 
what I am.
