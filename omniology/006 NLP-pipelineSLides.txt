This section would allow you to
conceptualise the overall process from  
using raw text to the point where it can
be fed to a machine learning model.
For instance; take Amazon Text
Reviews to a point where we can
create a machine learning model can
tell us if it is a positive or negative
review.

Most of the time data in the real world,
not limited to NLP but for data science
in general - data can be messy. In our
case, text data can be highly
unstructured. While learning NLP, most
times the datasets require
preprocessing - but not to the extent to
if you were actually creating your own
dataset from scratch. Nevertheless, I
will ensure that you get good practice
with cleaning some very dirty data.

Space - dimensions, positions. 

Closeness, distance. 

Machine learning involves models;
having its own ML pipeline - which
operate with a series of mathematical
executions, to learn from data, in order
to estimate the output on unseen data.
Example: the dataset can have 1000
reviews labelled positive or negative.
The model can predict if an unseen
review is negative or positive. 
Depending on the type of data, the
accuracy will vary depending on the
type of model.

If my dataset consists of Netflix movie
titles. The movie titles make up my
vocabulary. But what if this is not
enough to train my model on - Transfer
learning allows the model to use
already learned knowledge from a
gigantic dataset - this knowledge is
transferred from a related task to this
new dataset.

Think of this as - using the dataset, with
the new cleaned data; that was
converted into a machine readable
integer, structured form --> take this
data, think of it as knowledge; we are
taking this knowledge to iterate, the
way we would study words repeatedly
in order to learn it --> training the model
is simply teaching the
machine/teaching the computer.
