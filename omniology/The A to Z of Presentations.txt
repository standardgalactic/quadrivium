Preface
Preface	
Introduction to ‚ÄúThe A to Z of Presentations‚Äù

skilled, and enthusiastic. Ex-President Ford of the United States of America once said that being able to talk in front of 
an audience was the most important skill he wished he‚Äôd learnt and would have gone back to college if he could have 
mastered it. You don‚Äôt have to. The answers are all in this book.

Accents
In our more open and egalitarian times, regional dialects and accents are no longer regarded as an indication of breeding, 
education and background. They may even be regarded as an asset.
It is more likely you will be treated with suspicion if you put on a false accent. People may believe you are trying to be 
someone you are not. So have confidence in the natural sounds and tones of your own regional accent without hiding it.
When they were recruiting sales staff, First Direct, a telephone access bank, gave priority to applicants with Yorkshire vowels 
after a survey showed that the flat homely sounds of Bradford, Halifax and Wakefield inspired an image of trustworthiness 
and friendly professionalism.

Aikido, intellectual
‚ÄúAikido‚Äù is a Japanese martial art that uses an opponent‚Äôs strength to increase your own strength. It is a way of going with, 
not against, others. We can use a form of intellectual aikido to charm an audience.
Not: ‚ÄúI know some of you think this could be a waste of money, but you‚Äôre wrong...
But: ‚ÄúI know some of you think this could be a waste of money and you‚Äôre absolutely right! The easiest thing in the world 
is to under-utilise our products. That‚Äôs why we have an intensive training, back-up and after-sales service...‚Äù
3	
Alert Stance, an
You should stand to give a speech. Standing is an accepted convention of speech-making but also has the practical value 
of enabling everyone to see you. It also makes you look in command.
Think of having a spot which is your home base. This is where you will start and always return if you move about. Your 
basic stance should be the ‚Äúready‚Äù position, known in martial arts as the ‚Äújudoka‚Äù position. This is a stance in which your 
feet are 18‚Äù apart (shoulder-width), pointing slightly outward, with your weight on the balls of your feet. There should 
be a slight relaxation at the knees, your neck and shoulders should be free of tension and your head should feel as if it is 
suspended from a gossamer thread from a ceiling.
The basic stance looks ready and relaxed and allows you to make any necessary move easily and smoothly.
4	
Analogy
An analogy is a descriptive way of describing one concept by reference to another. It is what stories do when making a point.
One of the most memorable analogies was used by a guest speaker at a NASA Space conference. The conference was 
looking back on the Apollo moon expeditions of the 1960‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs and what could be learnt from them. The speaker 
ended his presentation with this analogy:

‚ÄúSome weeks after the Moon programme came to a close, I was driving away from the press room at the Houston centre 
when this dog came running up to my car. I pulled the car up, stopped and looked outside. What did I see? The dog 
taking a pee on my front nearside wheel. Then when he had made his mark, he sidled off and disappeared. As I drove 
away, I suddenly realised that that was exactly what we had done, we human beings. We‚Äôd wanted to leave our mark. We‚Äôd 
gone to the Moon and peed on it.‚Äù
5	
Anaphora
An ‚Äúanaphora‚Äù - from the Greek word for a reference - is an orator‚Äôs device for repeating the same words in a list. It is a 
favourite of politicians, for example, Churchill‚Äôs rallying wartime call: ‚ÄúWe shall fight them on the beaches; we shall fight 
them on the land; we shall fight them in the air.‚Äù
Curiously, anaphora works best with odd numbers, such as a list of three, five or seven items. It may be that a list of odd 
numbers appears less finished than even numbers and so stays longer in our memories.
‚ÄúThere are three parts to my talk: the problem, the possibilities, the solution.‚Äù
‚ÄúRemember: the context of the talk, the content of the agenda, and the contact with the listeners.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe can make progress; we can pull together; we can succeed.
6	
Appearance in Presentation
A whole industry has grown up based on personal image management. The rich, famous and popular employ style 
consultants to tell them how to look, what to wear and even how to change their appearance. We live in a visual and 
televisual age when what we see is what we believe.
Much the same is true of those who present before a live audience. The first impression an audience gets of a speaker is 
what they look like. We expect congruence: if a speaker wants us to believe in their ideas or products, we expect them to 
dress the part and look the part too.
The rule is to dress as best you can and appropriately, showing respect to your audience and a humble recognition that 
while you are speaking, you are on show.
7	
Articulation
Articulation is a form of gymnastics between the tip of the tongue, the teeth and the lips. If your audience hears ‚Äú50%‚Äù 
when you pronounced a gabbled ‚Äú15%‚Äù, it could make a big difference to the meaning of your presentation! Similar 
confusion can arise if you do not distinguish between ‚Äúm‚Äù and ‚Äún‚Äù, between ‚Äúf‚Äù and ‚Äús‚Äù or the last parts of words.
Loosening up with exercises and tongue-twisters is good preparation before a presentation. You could try each of these 
six times:

Attention Spans
Research indicates that most people‚Äôs attention spans start to decline after about 17 minutes of non-stop listening. Research 
also shows that attention is higher at the start and end of a talk than in the middle.
This means that you should time a once-off presentation to last no more than about 20 minutes. If your subject requires 
you to speak longer, think of using suitable breaks, intervals or a change of pace and style.
‚ÄúNo one can say just how long a message should be, but you rarely hear complaints about a speech being too short. The 
amateur worries about what he is going to put in his speech. The expert worries about what he should leave out. An 
artistic performance is concentrated, has a central focus.‚Äù (Edgar Dale)
9	
Audience Types
While every person in a business audience is different, marketing agencies suggest there are four main types of business 
audience. These are known as expressives, analyticals, amiables and drivers.
‚Ä¢ 
drivers Busy people, they will want you to start and finish on time. They are interested in the bottom line.
‚Ä¢ 
expressives Expressives warm to style and feeling. They want to feel good about your talk.
‚Ä¢ 
amiables Amiables enjoy the chance for social interaction with you and others. They find it hard to sit quiet.
‚Ä¢ 
analyticals Critics and cross-examiners, analyticals will only tune in to your arguments and facts.
10	
Audience, winning an
The main purpose of a presentation is to win an audience over to your views, whether they are facts, opinions or 
interpretations of facts and opinions.
You can only do this by one or a combination of the following:
1.	 focus on meeting their needs
2.	 charm them by your manner and manners
3.	 be distinct and memorable
4.	 provide an attention-grabbing idea

5.	 reassure them that there are minimal risks in what you propose
6.	 keep them interested
7.	 work to a plan which the audience can follow
8.	 lead them to where you want to take them
9.	 be yourself and naturally confident.
11	
Audiences, difficult
If you allow interruptions, questions and audience participation, you will sooner or later face difficult audiences.
While difficult audiences may annoy you, you must treat them all with tact, courtesy and deference.
If you‚Äôre clever, you can even turn their tactics to your advantage; a difficult audience is, after all, an interested audience. 
On no account should you argue, lose control or let others spoil your presentation for you.
One consolation is that no harm should come to you, even if you fail to win over a difficult audience. In the days of 
Demosthenes, (384 -324BC), the Athenians would put any orators who displeased them to death.
12	
Breathing
Breathing exercises before a presentation ensure that you are calm and relaxed when you begin to speak.
There are a number of good breathing exercises, ranging from simply becoming aware of your breathing to meditation. 
This simple exercise can be carried out anywhere: Find a quiet place where you can be undisturbed. Stand still and feel 
the ground beneath your feet. Imagine yourself suspended by a thread connected to the crown of your head. Let your 
neck and shoulders relax. Bend your knees a little. Bring the thumb and forefingers of both hands together and turn the 
palms upwards. Close your eyes. Now just listen to yourself breathing and allow any thoughts to wander in and out of 
your mind at will. Feel at ease and if you feel hurried, tell yourself there is no rush. Slow your breathing. In your own 
time, come back.
13	
Colours on a Chart
Colours on a flipchart or overhead can convey different shades of meaning, whether they are used in graphics or text.
‚Ä¢ 
Red = urgent;
‚Ä¢ 
Blue = traditional, factual;
‚Ä¢ 
Green = relaxed, future-oriented;
‚Ä¢ 
Yellow = light-hearted;
‚Ä¢ 
Orange = active, assertive;
‚Ä¢ 
Black = serious;
‚Ä¢ 
Brown = earthy;
‚Ä¢ 
Violet = luxurious;
‚Ä¢ 
Pink = soft.

Commanding Walk, a
When you are invited to speak, your walk to the front can immediately send messages to the audience of what‚Äôs going 
on in your mind.
A hurried or fumbling gait will reveal your nerves, whereas a practised walk at slightly slower than normal speed will 
show you are confident and not in a rush.
When a prize fighter walks to the ring and back from it, the champions, whether winners or not, always move at a defiantly 
slow pace.
When you take up your position in front of an audience, get a feel for the right distance. You will be able to mark out your 
territory, they will have theirs. Don‚Äôt over-step the boundary line until you have built enough rapport and it is safe to do so.
15	
Commentating
Commentating is similar to signposting and invaluable when showing visual aids. You commentate by presenting facts 
and views and then adding comments by way of explanation, asides and clarification.
This is how you might commentate on your speech while reading from an overhead:
‚Äú4,000 homes were burgled in this region last year.

(To give you an idea what that means that‚Äôs 1 in 8 of the population around here.)
The amount of property stolen was ¬£5 million.
(Well, most people will only ever earn a fifth of that in a whole lifetime if they‚Äôre lucky.)‚Äù
Commentating can be done by ad-libbing. Well-rehearsed presenters prepare and present their ad-libs as if they were 
spontaneous.
16	
Confidence
You become confident when you relax and can access the rich store of knowledge that is unique to you.
Confidence means feeling at one with others, knowing that you‚Äôre in this together and the only outcome is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to 
win and so are you.‚Äù
You can switch on confidence by practising poise, the ability to feel at home wherever you are.
Confident people are well-prepared but not so much that they lose the spark of spontaneity.
When you‚Äôre confident, you speak 15% louder than normal.
Confident people avoid doubts, self-criticism, and worry about the impression they‚Äôre making because they see themselves 
as able, acceptable, wanted and loved.
17	
Controlled Hands
The hands are the body parts that are the most difficult to control during a presentation. There is a tendency to make 
repeated gestures, nervous gestures and silly gestures, often without being aware of it. The audience, however, will not 
only notice, but may become transfixed by it, to the detriment of your talk.
The solution to what to do with your hands is to hold onto something with one hand and make occasional controlled 
gestures with the other hand. You can hold a lectern, the table, a pen, your notes, a pointer, anything which looks natural.
In time and with practice, you may be able to control the movement of your hands without any artificial aid.‚Äù
18	
Conviction Graph, the
To convince people about an idea, a product or service, you need to give them enough information to make up their 
minds and enough time and space to let them convince themselves.
This means finding the right balance between talking and staying quiet. If you miss the moment to stop and you continue 
to talk, you risk over-kill; if you stop too soon, they may not have enough information to go on.

The conviction graph is a diagram you can devise which shows you at what point in your presentation you should stop 
talking and let the audience convince themselves.
‚ÄúStand up to be seen; speak up to be heard; shut up to be liked.‚Äù
19	
Core Statement, the
The core statement is the first thing you should write out and check with your sponsor or the person who has asked you 
to speak.
The core statement is a summary of the purpose of your presentation and serves as a reminder throughout your planning 
of what is important.
The statement consists of the title, subject and purpose and who the presentation is intended for. For example:
Title: Belt up!
Subject: Car safety for passengers
Purpose: To explain the current laws on wearing rear seat safety belts in cars.
Audience: A mixed group of 8-year-old schoolchildren.
20	
Creative Pause, the
Some of the best moments in a speech are, surprisingly, those moments when you stop. Knowing when to stop is the art 
of the creative pause. It can work for you in a number of ways:
‚Ä¢ 
to tease the audience, perhaps after a provocative question
‚ÄúI bet you‚Äôd like to know how you could make a million...‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
to pause before the punchline of a joke
‚Ä¢ 
to wait for an audience to settle after laughter or a general discussion
‚Ä¢ 
to give the audience time to think (for example, when looking at a new overhead)
‚Ä¢ 
to show you‚Äôre in total control by holding the pause just slightly longer than you need to.
21	
Cue Cards
Cue cards are the reminder cards which prompt you through your speech. They can either be cues for a speech which 
you have learnt by heart or cues for a speech which you know well enough to deliver off-the-cuff. Cues should be ‚Äúfast 
food for the eyes‚Äù; in other words, easy to digest.
‚Ä¢ 
use a numbered sequence so that you can put the cards in the right order

22	
Difficult Audiences
If you allow interruptions, questions and audience participation, you will sooner or later face difficult audiences.
While difficult audiences may annoy you, you must treat them all with tact, courtesy and deference.
If you‚Äôre clever, you can even turn their tactics to your advantage; a difficult audience is, after all, an interested audience. 
On no account should you argue, lose control or let others spoil your presentation for you.
One consolation is that no harm should come to you, even if you fail to win over a difficult audience. In the days of 
Demosthenes, (384 -324BC), the Athenians would put any orators who displeased them to death.
23	
Difficult Questions
Questions from the floor may or may not enhance your presentation depending on the subject and your audience. If you 
do decide to take questions, you may need to field four different question types. These are set to trap you:

Emphasis
Changing the emphasis of the words we use in a sentence can completely alter the meaning of what we say. Say the 
sentences below putting the emphasis on the underlined words and notice how the meaning changes:
‚Ä¢ 
I should accept that job (rather than you)
‚Ä¢ 
I should accept that job (it‚Äôs better than anything else)
‚Ä¢ 
I should accept that job (rather than criticise it)
‚Ä¢ 
I should accept that job (rather than a different one)
‚Ä¢ 
I should accept that job (I have contempt for it).
Where we put the emphasis can seriously change what others hear. Ask someone the riddle: ‚ÄúHow many animals of each 
species did Moses take in the Ark?‚Äù with the emphasis on ‚Äúof each species‚Äù. Most people will answer ‚Äú2‚Äù because they hear 
‚Äúof each species‚Äù not the trick word ‚ÄúMoses‚Äù. The answer, of course, is that Moses took no animals into the Ark, Noah did.
29	
Endings
The ending can sometimes be the most important part of a presentation: if first impressions win you the audience, it is 
final impressions that last.
A classic ending should see you going out on a high note. The final message should encapsulate without merely repeating 
what you‚Äôve said.

Enthusiasm
‚ÄúEnthusiasm is the greatest business asset in the world: it beats money and power and influence. Single-handedly the 
enthusiast convinces and dominates.
Enthusiasm spurns inaction. Like an avalanche it overwhelms and engulfs all obstacles in its path, sweeps aside prejudice 
and opposition, storms the citadel of its objective.
Set the germ of enthusiasm afloat in your business: carry it in your attitude and manner; it spreads like a contagion and 
influences every fibre of your industry; it means joy and pleasure and satisfaction to your workers; it means life and virility; 
it means spontaneous bedrock results - the vital things that pay dividends.‚Äù (Quoted by Dorothy Sarnoff)
31	
Enunciation
To enunciate means to speak clearly. This means making sure that an audience hears every sound and letter of your words. 
Here are three exercises which help to improve enunciation.
Exercise 1 Repeat: ‚Äúthe tip of the tongue, the teeth and the lips‚Äù three times without gabbling.
Exercise 2 Practise exaggerated enunciation in front of a mirror. Remember people understand by watching your lips as 
well as hearing your words.
Exercise 3 Practise opening the mouth a little wider when pronouncing vowels. Practise biting into the consonants P, B, 
T, D, K and G, as in P,P,P; P,P,P; P,P,P Pah...; B, B, B; B, B, B; B, B, B Bah...; and so on.
32	
Eye Warmth
The eyes are the contact point between you and your audience. When there is an individual or collective meeting of eyes, 
there is warmth and rapport.
You should aim to have as much as 90% eye contact with your audience throughout the presentation. This of course 
means you have to know what you are going to say, and more you need to be scanning the audience for signs of feedback.
Aim to rest your eyes on each person at some point in the talk. When you look someone straight in the eye, you show 
the maximum amount of white and so your eyes appear to sparkle. You can avoid the appearance of staring at someone 
by moving your eyes around a triangle made up of their eyes and mouth.
To involve the audience, sweep them occasionally as a whole, moving from one side of the room to the other.

Fears, the ten worst human
The ten worst human fears recorded by David Wallechinsky in ‚ÄúThe Book of Lists‚Äù are:
1.	 Making a speech before a group
2.	 Heights
3.	 Insects and bugs
4.	 Financial problems
5.	 Deep water
6.	 Sickness
7.	 Death
8.	 Flying
9.	 Loneliness
10.	1Dogs
Now, you no longer need to fear anything in making a speech to any size of group!
34	
First Impressions Last
When you have been introduced or have completed your own formalities, the audience‚Äôs eyes and minds turn expectantly 
to you. They want you to interest them.
Your opening words and the way you express yourself must make an immediate impression. The audience needs to each 
say to themselves: ‚Äúthis looks worth staying for.‚Äù You must look and sound in charge.
One simple way to achieve this is to use an impact opening technique: one that intrigues, grabs the attention, and surprises 
without embarrassing or unnerving your audience.
In fiction, one of the most attention-grabbing openers is the opening sentence of George Orwell‚Äôs ‚Äú1984‚Äù: ‚ÄúIt was a bright 
cold day in April and the clocks were striking thirteen.‚Äù
35	
Flipcharts
The flipchart is the most versatile of presentation aids. It is easy to see and move and can be used by anyone anywhere. 
IBM boasts that all its offices around the world possess a flipchart for instant presentations. For the general presenter, it 
has replaced the teacher‚Äôs chalk and blackboard.
Flipcharts come into their own when you want to build an idea progressively with your audience using diagram, illustration 
or word. They are also excellent for producing one-page summaries such as mind maps.
The versatility of flipcharts means that pages can be used...

Gestures, meaningful
There are six meaningful gestures which have their part to play in a presentation:
‚Ä¢ 
directing, ie pointing at someone or something
‚Ä¢ 
describing, ie showing what you mean through the use of hands and arms (‚Äúthe one that got away‚Äù)
‚Ä¢ 
counting, ie the numbers one, two, three, on your fingers
‚Ä¢ 
holding something
‚Ä¢ 
making a dramatic gesture
‚Ä¢ 
signalling with your hands while someone else is speaking, eg ‚Äústop‚Äù, ‚Äúgo on‚Äù, ‚Äúwait‚Äù signals.
Any meaningful gesture needs to be deliberately used. To eliminate repetitive gestures of which you are unaware, get 
yourself video-ed during a run-through and critically analyse your appearance with a colleague.
39	
Hand Positions
The following fixed hand positions can look odd if held for too long:
‚Ä¢ 
the Duke of Edinburgh: hands clasped behind the back
‚Ä¢ 
the Napoleon: one hand inside the jacket
‚Ä¢ 
the Archbishop of Canterbury: hands clasped in front of the groin
‚Ä¢ 
the urchin: both hands deep in the pockets jangling money
‚Ä¢ 
the Lloyd George: hands fastened high on the lapels in oratorical mode.
Aim not to give people the wrong impression with where you put your hands. Unless you want to make a point, place 
them in neutral: at your sides, on a table or lectern, or holding on to something that you use in your talk.
40	
Inflection
Inflection is the way our voice rises and falls at the end of phrases to signal to listeners an underlying meaning.
‚Ä¢ 
if the voice stays level at the end of a phrase, it implies a statement
‚Ä¢ 
if the voice rises at the end of a phrase, it gives the effect of a question or an expectation of more to come
‚Ä¢ 
if the voice falls at the end of a statement, it implies a command or end.
A good example of inflection is the reading of football results:
Hull 3 Bradford 1; Plymouth Argyle 3 Oldham 4
41	
Information, gathering
The preparation stage between desktop planning and the first draft of your speech is the information-gathering stage. It 
is the stage when you research, gather, organise and play around with the material that you will use in your talk. There 
are five steps:
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

The A to Z of Presentations
27 
 
1.	 1. Research your information You can do this by collecting it at first hand, gathering ideas from others, or 
reading it up from written sources.
2.	 Arrange the information This means assigning headings and sub-headings to your material.
3.	 Filter the information Now you need to select the pieces of information which you would like to include in 
your speech together with anecdotes, jokes and stories.
4.	 Organise the information This is where you will outline your speech and decide what you will say where.
5.	 Put it all together: for example on a 1-page review.
42	
Jokes
Jokes are a way of amusing an audience while at the same time sharing something with them. The point of contact is the 
shared laughter. If a joke works it brings you together; conversely, if the joke doesn‚Äôt work, it pushes you apart. Jokes need 
to be appropriate, well-presented and, naturally, funny. A blue joke from the Rugby club dinner speech probably won‚Äôt 
work well at the annual conference of the Women‚Äôs Institute. Equally a joke told badly where you miss your timing, tell 
it too quickly or forget the punchline is worse than no joke at all.
This joke told by Patrick Forsyth seems to catch the mood of a farewell speech:
‚ÄúI remember the day after Nigel joined us and overhearing the impression he‚Äôd made on two young ladies from Accounts.‚Äù
‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt that Mr Green dress well,‚Äù said one.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied the other. ‚ÄúAnd so quickly.‚Äù
44	
Lead Them
The most effective way to lead an audience through your presentation is to try to follow them. Only by tuning in to where 
they are can you efffectively respond by delivering a talk that is relevant to them. This is not an easy thing to do in a one-
way presentation where opportunities for feedback are few. You can however do it if you...
‚Ä¢ 
go at their pace. Speed up your speaking rate for subjects that they are familiar with, slow down for subjects 
that are new.
‚Ä¢ 
watch out for signs that you are no longer getting through, such as whispers, fidgets, yawns
‚Ä¢ 
use ‚Äúwe‚Äù rather than ‚Äúyou‚Äù (‚ÄúWe have five minutes to look at Bioengineering. Let‚Äôs start with...‚Äù)
‚Ä¢ 
find common ground between you (‚ÄúLike yourselves, I travel a great deal, so I know how hard it is...‚Äù)
‚Ä¢ 
listen to what they say before your talk, during your talk and afterwards.
45	
Leading an Audience
When we plant facts in front of an audience and then show them solutions, we are leading an audience in a subtle way 
to where we want them to go.
Not: ‚ÄúOne answer to the problem of polluted streets is to control the emissions of diesel engines.

The A to Z of Presentations

But: ‚ÄúNone of us needs to be reminded that our streets are polluted. We only have to look outside. What will we find? Blackened 
buildings, summer smog, choking pedestrians, an increase in asthma. So what can we do? Very little, it seems against the 
relentless tide of traffic and pollution. But there is one simple answer. And that is to control the emissions of diesel engines.‚Äù
The rhetorical question, ‚ÄúWhat will we find?‚Äù is a useful device to raise the audience‚Äôs curiosity and in the next breath 
satisfy it.
46	
Lists and Checklists
The following is part of a presentation on computer office applications which uses a middle based around a list of five 
applications.
‚ÄúThere are five main applications for computer office software: databases, word processing, desk-top publishing, 
spreadsheets, and personal organisers.
First, databases. There are two kinds of databases: flatbed and relational.
Second, word processing. Here there is a wide range of options. Starting at the simple end...
Next, desktop publishing, one of the most fun uses of software. DTP can be used in numerous ways...

Mantras
Meditation is a form of relaxation which focuses all your thinking on one object, picture or sound.
A mantra meditation directs your focused thinking onto a repeated phrase, a mantra being a mystical Hindu chant. The 
repeated words can take your mind off your presentation, relax you and put you into the positive frame of mind expressed 
in the words.
This is a mantra to use before you speak and can be said to yourself for as long as you have to wait.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm pleased I‚Äôm here;
I‚Äôm pleased you‚Äôre here;
I care about you;
I know that I know.‚Äù
48	
Middles of Presentations
The ‚ÄúMiddles‚Äù are the main bodies of presentations. They should have a structure which the audience can see and follow 
but which doesn‚Äôt constrain or prove artificial. The structure needs to be right for the subject.
In informative talks, structures are fact-based. The following seven can be used for presentations of information: lists; 
checklists; bullet points; logical steps; sequences; mnemonics; numbers.
In persuasive talks, boil the message down to a few main themes and then add supporting examples and anecdotes at 
relevant points. The word ‚Äúanecdote‚Äù comes from the Greek word ‚Äúan‚Äù meaning ‚Äúprivate‚Äù and ‚Äúekdotos‚Äù meaning ‚Äúa written 
publication‚Äù, hence a short incident on someone‚Äôs private life.
49	
Mnemonics in Presentations
The following example of a presentation on Stress management uses the word STRESS as a mnemonic to make six points 
about stress.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at six ways to beat stress. We can remember them easily in the word stress itself, so that when we feel ‚Äústress‚Äù; 
we can think of these antidotes.
S means Slow down. Just do things that little bit more slowly.
T says ‚ÄúTake a break‚Äù. Ease up, go and look at the flowers, admire the view.

R is relax. Learn some relaxation techniques.
E means Exercise. This can be anything you enjoy doing, from aerobic exercise to a brisk walk.
S stands for Switching off and letting go.
S, the last S, is to Swim with the tide and let the waves take you where you want to go.‚Äù

Narratives
Everyone loves a story.
A story appeals to the imaginative right brain as well as the factual left brain. A story can amuse us, hold us in suspense and 
paint a picture. A story can make exactly the same points as the points themselves, without people being fully conscious 
of it. A story uses people and personalities to add flesh to the facts. A story gives insight into human motives and reasons.
If you find your factual presentations sound staid and colourless, turn them into stories instead.
‚ÄúA good picture is said to be worth a thousand words, but a good story is worth a thousand pictures.‚Äù
51	
Natural Smiles
There are over 20 different kinds of smile, from sheepish grins to sinister smirks. Your talk may require you to call on 
any of these at any time, but your natural smile should be a relaxed, friendly and self-confident one. It should say to your 
audience: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to be here; I‚Äôm happy that you‚Äôre here.‚Äù
There are a few significant moments in your presentation when a smile can help.
‚Ä¢ 
just before you start speaking, look up at everyone, pause and smile
‚Ä¢ 
when you make contact with anyone directly, encourage their involvement with a smile
‚Ä¢ 
when you end, thank them with a smile.

Nerves
The symptoms of nerves before a presentation are the symptoms of stress. When the mind perceives a threat, as it does 
when it thinks about everything that could go wrong, it automatically switches on the fight-flight response. In gearing up 
for this reaction, the following symptoms of ‚Äúnerves‚Äù will appear:
‚Ä¢ 
stage-fright
‚Ä¢ 
butterflies
‚Ä¢ 
sweaty palms
‚Ä¢ 
shallow breathing
‚Ä¢ 
thumping heart
‚Ä¢ 
weak knees
‚Ä¢ 
panic

loss of control
If you feel nervous facing a large audience, imagine that you are just talking to one or two close friends instead.

Openers, formal presentation
Whether you are kicking off yourself, or being introduced by the chair, the formal opening to a presentation is always the 
same. It can consist of five brief and separate formalities:
‚Ä¢ 
a courteous welcome, expressed sincerely

a short self-introduction, saying who you are, who you represent, and why you have come
‚Ä¢

Overheads
The overhead transparency has become the standard tool for presenters, particularly when speaking to large audiences.
Transparencies are valuable for conveying information which words cannot adequately describe. This includes pie charts, 
graphs, tables of figures and diagrams. Successive slides can also be used to build a show by adding slides to previous ones, 
or by unmasking sections of the slide as you go. Overheads are also indispensable if you want to show your audience an 
idea or theme, such as a picture or drawing, that you cannot draw yourself or have no time to draw during the presentation.
If they are used as an integral part of your presentation, you need to rehearse your overhead show as much as any other 
part of your performance.
59	
Pace, speaking
We each have a natural speaking pace which reflects the flow of thoughts and feelings in our brains. Women, for example, 
tend to speak more quickly than men because their feelings flow more freey.
Since we speak at the pace that suits us, it is difficult to realise that this may not be a pace that suits others. When some 
people in an audience fidget, while others appear calm and attuned, it is probably because some are tuned in to your 
speaking rate while others are not.
In a prepared speech, we can compensate for the different paces in an audience by varying the rates at which we speak: 
sometimes speeding up, for example when building to a climax and sometimes slowing down when we require emphasis, 
solemnity or suspense.
60	
Pauses
A pause should be a planned and definite act and should not be filled with ‚Äúums‚Äù, ‚Äúers‚Äù and ‚Äúbasicallys‚Äù or a look of 
embarrassment.
‚Ä¢ 
audiences appreciate pauses. It lets them catch up and helps them to think. It is a way of building interest 
and suspense.
‚Ä¢ 
pauses allow you time to collect your thoughts which are always just a little ahead of your words
‚Ä¢ 
pauses are natural punctuation marks. If you are keeping pace with your audience, you know just how long 
to pause to keep them interested.
The great pianist Arthur Schnabel said: ‚ÄúThe notes I handle no better than many pianists. But the pauses between the 
notes...that‚Äôs where the art resides.‚Äù
61	
Persuasion, the 5 P‚Äôs of
The middle part of a persuasive presentation is an exercise in leading the audience through the current situation via 
the options for improvement to the solution. One classic structure for the body of a persuasive presentation is the 5 P‚Äôs, 
consisting of present situation; problem; possibilities; pros and cons; and proposal.

‚ÄúSpace is now extremely limited in all the offices and has become critical since the increased workload. The result is 
cramped conditions for staff to work in, inefficient working practices and deteriorating customer service. There are three 
possible options: to cut back on the workload, to extend or to move. It is not possible to cut back due to the legislative 
timetable. The building is at its physical limits. This leaves moving as the only viable option. It is proposed that a feasibility 
study be carried out urgently into the possibilities of moving to Windsor Street.‚Äù
62	
Persuasive Words, the 12 most
A group of students from Harvard University in America carried out research into which words were used most frequently 
in successful sales talks.
The following is their list of the 12 most persuasive words:
1.	 discovery
2.	 easy
3.	 health
4.	 guarantee
5.	 love
6.	 new
7.	 money
8.	 results
9.	 proven
10.	1safety
11.	1save
12.	1you.
63	
Phrasing
If the unit of writing is the word, the unit of speaking is the phrase.
A speech can be broken into chunks of phrases which carry individual pieces of meaning. When we deliver our speech, 
it is necessary to speak in phrases rather than separate words so that we convey the whole meaning.
Phrases and their meanings make sense to listeners through the pauses between each phrase. Newscasters and broadcasters 
are expert at phrasing...
‚ÄúHere is the news (pause)...Early today....‚Äù

Pitch
Pitch is the degree of acuteness in the voice. A low and slow pitch can indicate gravity; a high and fast pitch can indicate 
excitement.
To get a sense of the different levels of pitch, try these sentences out loud. Read them first from top to bottom, then from 
bottom to top and then randomly.
High pitch: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wonderful day!‚Äù
Middle pitch with inflection on ‚Äúlovely‚Äù: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lovely day!‚Äù
Middle pitch: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nice day!‚Äù
Lower pitch: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a miserable day!‚Äù
Lower pitch still: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a horrid day!‚Äù

Planting
‚ÄúPlanting‚Äù is a technique which places facts and information right in front of the audience, possibly with a challenging 
question. When the audience has then asked themselves the question, you offer up the solution which you want them 
to consider.
Not: We developed a much faster drive which should meet the needs of the IT department.
But: We were told that the IT department found the old drives much too slow. It won‚Äôt surprise you then to know where 
we concentrated our efforts. Yes, that‚Äôs right. On building faster drives.
Planting a fact, inviting the audience to study it and then suggesting an answer is a more seductive way to lead an audience 
than simply speaking at them. It creates the feeling that you are working with the audience not on a different track from 
them.
66	
Presentation Style
A presentation is more persuasive and more interesting if the body of the talk presents information in a variety of ways.
Simple talk-and-listen is only one way to convey information and perhaps not always the best. There are seven different 
ways in which we can put things over to an audience.
1.	 The written word: handouts; overheads; leaflets
2.	 Sound: discussion; voices; quotes; music
3.	 Pictures: visual aids; video; diagrams;
4.	 Touch: feeling textures; handling products
5.	 Intrapersonal: reflection and time to think
6.	 Numerical: statistics; prices; sums
7.	 Interpersonal: questions and answers
67	
Presentation Techniques
The following are ten techniques for bringing a presentation text to life:
1.	 choice of words: use words whose meaning is instantly understandable to your audience
2.	 the written and the spoken: use idiomatic conversational English
3.	 signposting: let people know where you‚Äôre going
4.	 planting: use this technique to lead an audience
5.	 respect prior knowledge: deliver information on the assumption that your audience may already know it
6.	 word lists: make sense of word lists
7.	 anaphora: use anaphora to build up rhythm
8.	 jokes: use jokes wisely
9.	 the creative pause: learn how to pause for maximum effect
10.	1narratives: tell stories and analogies to add interest and humour to your message.

The following are definitions of a presentation:
I
‚ÄúA presentation takes place in order to persuade a person or group of people to..
‚Ä¢ 
adopt or revise an attitude
‚Ä¢ 
accept or modify an opinion
‚Ä¢ 
take or refrain from taking an action or decision.‚Äù
(Antony Jay)
II
‚ÄúA presentation is a form of predominantly formal and one-way communication aimed at giving information to one or 
more people in ways that enable them to act.‚Äù
69	
Presentation, preparing a
There are seven steps in moving from the germ of a presentation to being ready to deliver. They are:
1.	 desktop planning think through your presentation with pen and paper
2.	 gather material research and collect material you need to use which relates to the purpose of your talk
3.	 write the first draft at this stage you can either write out the presentation in full or in note form
4.	 produce cue cards cue cards are the hints you need to take you through your talk 
5.	 prepare the room this means ideally visiting the room where you are going to speak or, if you are unable to, 
preparing the layout on paper
6.	 rehearse for a slick performance, you should rehearse until you are sure of what you want to say
7.	 now forget it until you need to prepare yourself just before the talk.

72	
Prior Knowledge
Unless you‚Äôre sure of who you‚Äôre talking to, you won‚Äôt always know how much your audience already knows about your 
views or products.
This presents a simple dilemma: if you assume they don‚Äôt know, you will give them information presented as ‚Äúnew 
information‚Äù. The result is that those who already know will become bored and find your speech lack-lustre.
On the other hand, if you assume they know and leave the information out, you may be wrong and leave people muddled 
and confused.
Respecting ‚Äúprior knowledge‚Äù gets round this dilemma. It allows you to present new information as if people already knew it.
73	
Questions, difficult 
Questions from the floor may or may not enhance your presentation depending on the subject and your audience. If you 
do decide to take questions, you may need to field four different question types. These are set to trap you:
1.	 The test question to find out how much you know.
‚ÄúWhat evidence do you have for making these claims?‚Äù
2.	 The show-off question in which the questioner wants to show how clever they are.
3.	 The defensive question which may reveal that someone feels under threat, eg ‚ÄúHow do you know this‚Äôll 
work?‚Äù (= I‚Äôm scared if it does)
4.	 The concealed objection, which is a way of challenging you, eg ‚ÄúWhy is the price so high?‚Äù
74	
Rapport, losing
Lost rapport is the feeling deep in the pit of your stomach when you realize that you have lost your audience and are no 
longer getting through to them.
It may be a feeling you pick up, or signs of boredom among the row of faces. It may be when you dry up or start to feel 
anxious about the impression you‚Äôre making. It may be panic and a wish that the floor would suddenly open up and 
release you from the torment.
At times like these - and every seasoned speaker has experienced them - your only course of action is to stay calm and 
regain control of your thoughts, feelings and actions. If you test your fears by re-connecting with the audience, say by asking 
for questions, there is every likelihood that you are mistaken; the audience aren‚Äôt lost, they may be intensely interested.

Rehearsing
Rehearsing - or ‚Äúre-hearing‚Äù - is an essential part of preparing your speech. There are three ways to rehearse and you 
should use all three.
1.	 To yourself Internal rehearsal can be done anywhere at any time, even in bed before you go to sleep. It 
means visualising yourself giving your speech, mouthing the words and going through each move.
2.	 To the mirror Rehearsing in front of a mirror, ideally ful-length, enables you to see yourself as others will see 
you; and to try out the moves and sequences of your talk.
3.	 Dress rehearsal You should practise your speech ‚Äúfor real‚Äù either alone or with an audience of colleagues. 
This allows you to time yourself. Do this well in advance of your presentation so that you can make changes.
76	
Resonance, voice
Resonance is the sound made when your breath reverberates in the empty spaces inside you. It gives a deeper, stronger 
quality to your voice. If you are speaking in a large room without a microphone, resonance will enable you to fill up the 
space without straining.
In this exercise, you can feel resonance by placing both hands on each part of your body and pronouncing the sound as 
deeply as you can.
‚Ä¢ 
Place your hands on your tummy and say ‚ÄúOh‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
on your abdomen and say ‚ÄúAh‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
on your breastbone and say ‚ÄúAh‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
on your throat and say ‚ÄúI‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
on the top of your head and say ‚ÄúEe‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
on your head and tummy and say ‚ÄúOi‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 
on your tummy and say ‚ÄúOh‚Äù
77	
Seating Styles
There are three basic kinds of audience seating:
a)	 Theatre style Theatre-style seating is necessary for large audiences and lecture-style talks. You need to make 
sure that in any theatre-style arrangement, you can see everyone in the room and they can see you.
b)	 Horse-shoe shape Horse-shoes shapes, with or without seat-tables, are best when you have a group of up to 
15 and you want participation. This shape is quite intimate since you are in uninterrupted contact with your 
audience.
c)	 Village-style Village-style seating works best when you want to involve the audience in small group work. It 
is however much harder to keep order with small groups at separate tables.

Show Don‚Äôt Just Tell
Turning a simple presentation point into a narrative or story can entertain and involve the audience on a different level. 
It is a way of showing them not just telling them.
Not: ‚ÄúOur personal computer has three kinds of memory storage: the random access memory, the hard drive and the 
floppy drive.‚Äù
But: ‚ÄúDesigning the storage memory for this particular computer was always going to be a tricky problem. The first team 
to look at it was Rob James and Ellen Smith. After several experiments they discovered that they could build in a huge 
RAM but their problem was what to do with the hard drive. This was new territory. Neither of them had worked on 
anything like that before. First, they tried a separate box. No good. Then a new casing. Still no good. They were about to 
give up when news came from Japan about an amazing new microchip...‚Äù
79	
Signposting
The technique of Signposting, or Labelling, can be used throughout a presentation. Signposting, like the signs on a street, 
is a way of letting the audience know in advance what is coming next in your talk. It is used to tell the audience what 
you want them to understand from it.

80	
Tone
Tone is a musical expression which includes tempo, pitch, timbre and emphasis. We usually refer to a person‚Äôs range of 
speaking tones in the same way as we speak of the range of tones of a musical instrument.
Most English speakers have just two or three tones of the musical scale (some are monotone). The Welsh and West 
Highlanders of Scotland on the other hand use at least an octave and a half.
Speech is more interesting and enjoyable to listen to when we use a wide variety of tones.

Under Starter‚Äôs Orders
In the moments before you start to speak, the audience are a disorganised and disparate collection of individuals, pairs 
and small groups. They are like the runners before a horse race facing in different directions.
The moment you move to speak, they come under your control, falling expectantly silent, turning towards you, lining 
up together. 
They are under starter‚Äôs orders.
It is at this moment, when you have the full undivided attention of your audience, that you are able to set the tone, make 
a strong impression and lead them in the direction you want them to go.
84	
Visuals
There are five main kinds of visual aids: props; flipcharts; overheads; handouts; photographic material. Other visual aids 
which can be called on are: LCD and computer screen displays; audio-cassettes; table-top mini-flipcharts; fixed white 
boards.
There are some general rules to bear in mind when using visual aids:
‚Ä¢ 
make sure everyone can see your visual aids
‚Ä¢ 
keep the visual aids simple and to the point
‚Ä¢ 
avoid too many capital letters; lower case is easier to read
‚Ä¢ 
don‚Äôt overdo the number of visual aids; use them only where there is no other way to make your point
‚Ä¢ 
make them dynamic so that people think ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù eg using a succession of slides on top of each other
‚Ä¢ 
rehearse their use until you are slick
‚Ä¢ 
stay in control of the on/off switch of the machine.
85	
Voice, using the
There are a number of ways we can adjust the way our voice sounds. Here are ten of the most important for the presenter:
1.	 volume: loud or quiet?
2.	 pace: quick or slow?
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

The A to Z of Presentations
47 
 
3.	 pitch: high or low?
4.	 articulation: clear or garbled?
5.	 resonance: deep or shallow?
6.	 tone: monotone or multi-tone?
7.	 phrasing: do we speak in phrases or in sentences?
8.	 pauses: are our pauses at natural stops?
9.	 inflection: does our voice rise and fall with the sense of our words?
10.	1accents: is our accent natural or false?
86	
Volume
Voice volume and projection are the two means by which your message reaches everyone in the room.
Good volume and projection are the result of using the breath. Some people speak on the inward breath which loses the 
voice in the intake of air; some on a held breath which creates tension. 
The best way to speak and project is on the outward breath. If, when you breath in, you fill not just the lungs and chest 
but also the diaphragm (the area of the abdomen below the tummy), you will have the maximum exhaling breath with 
which to speak.
Always aim to project your voice to the back of the room, so that it hits and rebounds off the rear wall. This kind of voice 
projection comes as much from your mind as it does from your voice.

Wall Push, the
The Wall Push is a technique recommended by writer Dorothy Sarnoff to control stage fright in actors. It was used 
successfully by Yul Brynner, star of the musical ‚ÄúThe King and I‚Äù.
The technique is as follows:
Stand about 18‚Äù away from a wall and place your palms flat on it. Push against the wall. As you push, the muscles of 
your ‚Äúrectus abdominis‚Äù will contract. As you breath out, hiss and contract the muscles below the rib cage as if you were 
rowing a boat against the current.
A similar effect can be produced by pressing the base of the hands against each other, elbows akimbo.
These moves prevent the production of nerve-enhancing noradrenaline and epinephrine.
88	
Word Lists
A common technique in written English is to make a list of items and then say what connects them.
‚ÄúChamberlain, Churchill, Eden, MacMillan, Home - all Tory leaders with aristocratic connections...‚Äù
When reading a list, we can always go back through it if we‚Äôre not sure who or what was in it. This is not possible in 
spoken English, so the meaning of the list needs to be clear from the start.
‚ÄúChamberlain was a Tory leader with aristocratic connections. So were Churchill, Eden, MacMillan, and Home.‚Äù
89	
Writing and Speaking
Speakers who lack the confidence to speak directly to their audience tend to lean heavily on their prepared texts. This 
creates the risk of speaking the written word which can sound artificial and stilted.
Conversational English on the other hand is natural and flowing. By creating the feeling of a personal chat, the conversational 
style helps to build audience rapport.
Idiomatic, conversational English is distinctly different from written English. It allows for occasional ungrammatical and 
incorrect use of words and sentences, as long as the meaning is clear and sounds right. You would not, for example, say 
the grammatically-correct ‚ÄúFor whom is it?‚Äù in place of the colloquial ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs it for?‚Äù
