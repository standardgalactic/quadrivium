Intended Audience
This book is intended for designers who are serious about their craft. It is ideal for students who 
desire an approach to instruction that focuses on software proficiency. It is an excellent choice 
for instructors and industry trainers who have been looking for a comprehensive textbook that 
includes handouts, projects, syllabi, and resources. What differentiates Exploring Adobe InDesign 
CS5 from a reference book, is that it focuses on those InDesign features that are used 90% of the 
time. This concentrated approach, and mastery of design and production techniques presented in 
the text, leave the designer well prepared for using InDesign effectively in production settings. 
Typesetting is an art, and typography is emphasized throughout Exploring Adobe 
InDesign CS5. The power of Adobe InDesign, when combined with the knowledge of 
typography, will give designers the ability to create documents with visual impact.
How to Use This Book
Before beginning this book, readers should already know computer basics such 
as launching programs, using a mouse, saving files, and printing. 
Exploring Adobe InDesign CS5’s in-chapter exercises are supplemented with an array of 
projects at the end of the each chapter. These supplemental projects will require a higher 
degree of independent problem solving and application. Access to a computer with 
Exploring Adobe InDesign CS5 will be essential for completing the practice exercises.
Chapters should be read in order, from the beginning to the end. The skills presented in earlier 
chapters create the foundation necessary for completing exercises in the later chapters. Techniques 
are first introduced, and then applied in the context of industry-level projects. This project-
based approach uses critical thinking, review, and practice to help designers achieve mastery.

introduction
You are about to explore new horizons in digital page layout. This book will introduce 
you to Adobe® InDesign® CS5, today’s standard in page layout software. For those 
of you who are already familiar with a page layout program, you will be delighted 
and impressed with InDesign’s extraordinary capabilities and innovation.
After teaching and working with other major page layout programs for 18 years, I must admit I 
was a bit skeptical when I began working with InDesign. But in just a few weeks I was convinced 
that Adobe InDesign is the most creative, comprehensive, and intuitive page layout program on 
the market today. By the time you finish this book, I know you will agree. No other program in the 
graphics industry can compete with the bold imagination and astounding new features of InDesign.
Are you ready to begin mastering InDesign? We’re going to begin with a Getting Started section 
found on the next four pages. This section will introduce you to best practices in production 
and provide tips for maximizing the features of your software. It will also help you understand 
how to best use this text. If you already have a basic knowledge of InDesign or are the type 
of person who never reads the directions, you may be tempted to skip this section. But 
understanding and following the instructions in this section are like checking your oil, tire 
pressure, and filling you car with gas before starting a road trip. And, what a trip this will 
be! If you hit a pot hole or run into a road block along the way, feel free to email me and I’ll 
try to provide some roadside assistance (trydberg@mac.com). InDesign is a fantastic piece 
of software—and with practice and determination, you’ll be cruisin’ in no time at all!

Getting Started
▶ INSTALLING AND UNINSTALLING INDESIGN
Before you begin this book, you should be familiar with a computer keyboard and 
have a basic understanding of how to operate a mouse. You should know how to 
launch applications, make choices from menus, click with a mouse to select objects, 
and drag to highlight text. And you should already know how to load software.
When you install InDesign, make sure to write down or photocopy the 
activation code or serial number that came with your software and place 
it in safe keeping. This only takes a minute—and is much easier (and less 
frustrating) than trying to retrieve the information after it’s lost.
A single-user retail license activation 
supports two computers. For example, 
you can install the product on a desktop 
computer at work and on a laptop 
computer at home. If you want to install 
the software on a third computer, first 
deactivate InDesign on one of the other 
two computers. Choose Help > Deactivate.
▶ FONTS
The installation discs contain a variety of resources to help you make the 
most of your Adobe software. The Goodies folder contains bonus fonts that 
you will probably want to install. The complete list of typefaces bundled with 
InDesign can be found in the back of this book, just before the index.
▶ BACK UP THE ARTWORK AND RESOURCES FOLDER
As you work through this text, you will notice that there are exercises included in the 
narrative of the text, and more projects presented at the end of chapters. Completing 
these projects will strengthen your skills and help move you toward mastery. To work 
on these projects, you will need to access text and images files from the Exploring 
Adobe InDesign CS5 compact disc accompanying this book. A folder that corresponds 
to each chapter (01 Artwork and Resources, 02 Artwork and Resources, 03 Artwork 
and Resources, etc.) can be found in Artwork and Resources, a folder included on 
the Exploring InDesign CD. Each chapter folder contains text and image files, and a 
.pdf document with instructions for the end-of-chapter projects. It would be a good 
idea to place a copy of the Artwork and Resources folder on your hard drive.

▶ MODIFY INDESIGN PREFERENCES
InDesign comes with a built-in set of defaults. Modifying some of these defaults 
will make your production much smoother. When you change defaults with InDesign 
launched, but with no document open, you are changing the application preferences. 
Once they are changed, the changes will apply to all future documents.
When you change InDesign preferences with a document open, the changes apply to 
the current document only. This is called changing the document preferences.
Follow these steps to change the application preferences to match those used in this text.
1.  Launch InDesign, but do not create a new document. You should see the InDesign menu, the 
Control panel, and the Toolbox.
2.  Press Command+K (Mac) or
Control+K (Windows) to open
the Preferences dialog.
3.  Along the left side of the
Preferences window, you will see a list 
of categories. Select each category 
and make the following changes:
•  Type: select Apply Leading
to Entire Paragraphs
•  Units & Increments>Ruler Units:
Origin: Page, Horizontal: Inches,
Vertical: Inches
•  Units & Increments>Keyboard
Increments: Size/Leading: 1 pt
Baseline Shift: 1 pt
4. Accept changes and exit the dialog box.
5.  Go to File>Document Setup.
Deselect Facing Pages. Make sure
the Page Size is set to Letter.
Press Return (Mac) or Enter (Windows).

▶ BEST PRACTICES
1.  Use keyboard shortcuts. Throughout the book, you will be encouraged to use keyboard 
shortcuts whenever possible. Activating a keyboard shortcut, instead of selecting menus 
or opening panels, is a more efficient method of working. Keyboard shortcuts usually 
consist of a combination of modifier keys and letters or symbols. For Mac users, the 
modifier keys include Shift, Control, Option, and Command. Windows users use Shift, 
Control and Alt. Both platforms utilize function keys F1–F12 found above the numbers 
on the keyboard. When a keyboard shortcut is listed as Command+S, this means: “Hold 
the Command key, press the S key, and release.” F5 means: “Press function key 5, and 
release.” Throughout the text, important keyboard shortcuts 
will be displayed in color for easy reference. Try to memorize 
these shortcuts and use keyboard shortcuts whenever 
possible. Over the course of your professional career, the 
time you save using shortcuts will be significant.
2.  Open documents from a local hard drive. When you store a document on a portable 
drive or a server, it is important to move the document to your local hard drive 
before opening it. Opening documents from storage media can cause damage.
3.  Do a Save As when your project is completed. Each time you Save a document, 
InDesign adds more data to the document, but doesn’t remove outdated 
data. When you choose Save As, InDesign completely rewrites the document, 
using only current information. This keeps your file size smaller and decreases 
the time required for printing or redrawing the image on the screen.
4.  Use the least number of text frames possible. This keeps 
your document smaller and easier to maintain.
5.  Use context menus. These are activated by holding the Control key and clicking 
(Mac), or clicking the right mouse button (Windows) when you have an object 
selected. This is a quick method of choosing commonly used commands.
6.  Use shortcut keys in dialog boxes. Press Return (Mac) or Enter (Windows) instead of 
choosing OK. Press Command+period (Mac) or Esc (Mac and Windows) to exit a dialog 
box. In some dialog boxes, holding Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) changes the Cancel 
button to a Reset button, allowing you to make changes without exiting the dialog box.
7.  Never remove the .indd file extension from any of your files.
8.  Use quality fonts. InDesign works best with OpenType, Type 1 (PostScript), and 
TrueType fonts. Corrupt fonts can damage your document and crash your computer!
9.  Create folders to organize your projects. Keep images used in the document 
organized inside the folder. Use the Package operation (introduced in Chapter 13).

▶ DOCUMENT RECOVERY
InDesign has a built-in document recovery system that protects your files against 
unexpected power failures or computer crashes. Automatic recovery data exists 
in a temporary file that is separate from your InDesign document.
If you crash, here are the steps to recover your file.
• Start your computer.
• Launch InDesign.
•  InDesign will display any recovered documents. An asterisk will appear 
in front of the file name in the title bar of the document.
•  Choose File>Save As and specify a new location and name for the file.
•  If you had saved the document before crashing, and the recovered document is 
an older version that you don’t want to keep, close the file without saving it.
•  If InDesign can’t open your document, it means it was 
permanently damaged during the crash.
This feature is designed for emergencies only. You should still 
save your documents often, and make backups!
▶  THIS IS A TEXTBOOK—PLEASE, DON’T SKIP THE PROJECTS!
This is a textbook, not an InDesign reference book. In addition to software techniques, you 
will learn design and typography concepts. You should work through the book in sequence. 
The skills presented in each chapter become the foundation for moving to the next level. As 
the projects get harder, the instructions become less detailed, forcing you to dig into your 
memory bank to apply the skills you learned in earlier chapters. The projects at the end of 
the chapter require you to apply newly-learned skills, while reviewing and reinforcing earlier 
techniques. I can guarantee that, if you systematically work through all the chapters and 
projects, you will have mastery of the InDesign functions you will use 95% of the time.
Learning new software is like learning to play a musical instrument—you need to 
practice, practice, practice. The best way to learn software is to use it every day.
Finally, you should have fun learning InDesign! InDesign has brought much joy into my 
life. You might think it strange for a person to attribute such power to a piece of software. 
But by the time you finish this book, I think you’ll understand what I mean!

The InDesign Workspace
The InDesign workspace consists of the following items:
▶
Document window
▶
Menu bar
▶
Application Frame and Application Bar
▶
Control panel
▶
Toolbox
▶
Panels
Launch InDesign by clicking the icon on the dock shown in 
Visual 1–1, or by double-clicking the icon in the Applications 
folder (Mac), or by selecting Adobe InDesign CS5 from the 
Start menu (Windows). When the program launches, you will 
be welcomed to InDesign by a screen that contains a host of options, including 
an overview of new features in InDesign CS5, tutorials, and learning resources 
(Visual 1–2). You can create new documents and open recent documents from 
this screen. You may want to place a check in the box in the lower left corner 
so that this screen will not appear when launching the program, but do this 
only after you have gone through the tutorial and overview opportunities.
We’ll get started immediately by creating a sample document to introduce us 
to the document window and navigating through InDesign dialog boxes.
1. 
Press Command+N (Mac) or Control+N (Windows) to create a new document.
2. 
Press the Tab key to jump to the next field in the New Document dialog box (or any 
dialog box in InDesign). Press Shift+Tab to move backwards through the fields. Practice 
moving through each field in the New Document dialog box using these methods.

Pressing the Tab key is an excellent method of 
selecting any field. Another excellent method to select 
the field is by clicking on the name to the left of the 
field (Visual 1–3). Once you grow accustomed to 
selecting fields by clicking on the name to the left 
of the field, you’ll wish all the software you use had 
that feature! (The most inefficient method of selecting 
a field is to place the cursor in the field and double-click or drag to highlight 
the area.) Once the content in a field is highlighted, type your new information 
over the old information. Don’t re-select a field that is already highlighted!
3. 
Enter these values in the New 
Document dialog box: Intent: Print. 
Number of Pages: 1. Page Size: 
Letter (8.5"× 11"). Be sure that the 
Facing Pages and Master Text Frame 
options are not selected. Columns: 3. 
Margins: 0.75". Orientation: Portrait
(first icon). Portrait orientation 
means that the height of 
your document is greater 
than the width. Landscape 
orientation means that 
your document is wider 
than it is high (Visual 1–5).
In the middle of the Margins

link was closed when you entered the margin value, 0.75" 
automatically appeared in the other three margin fields.

Five view modes can be found at the bottom of the Toolbox 
(Visual 1–7). You are viewing your document in Normal mode, 
the default viewing mode. When Normal is selected, you will 
see the document outlined in black, with magenta guides 
designating the 0.75" margin on all sides. Violet lines designate 
the column guides. Press W to switch to Preview mode. In this mode, all guides are 
hidden, and the pasteboard is changed to gray, the default preview background color. 
The pasteboard is the area surrounding the document, as shown in Visual 1–9. Press 
W again, and you return to Normal mode. Bleed and Slug view modes show areas 
created outside the document size. Bleeds and slugs will be introduced in Chapter 6.
You may see some differences 
as you compare your document 
window to the example shown in 
Visual 1–9. Let’s make sure we’re 
all looking at the same document 
workspace. From the Menu 
bar, go to Window>Workspace 
(Visual 1–8). Notice that 
InDesign has several 
selections from which to 
choose. Choose [Essentials] . 
When you release the mouse, your document window should look like Visual 1–9. 
The New Workspace menu option allows you to save any customization you’ve 
made to the InDesign workspace. We’ll cover that at the end of the chapter.
The Menu Bar
The Menu bar stretches across the top of the document window and displays these 
categories: InDesign (Mac only), File, Edit, Layout, Type, Object, Table, View, Window,
and Help (Visual 1–10). As you press and move your pointer across the Menu bar, 
you will see that underneath each category are menu 
items, most of which can be accessed by using keyboard 
shortcuts. Keyboard shortcuts are listed to the right 
of the menu items. This chart shows how to interpret 
the symbols listed with Mac keyboard shortcuts.
Some menu items are followed by a triangle or ellipsis. 
When a triangle follows a menu item, it means that a submenu will open and 
more menu options will be displayed. An ellipsis means that a dialog box will 
open when the menu item is selected (Visual 1–10). InDesign encourages you

to customize your work environment to maximize productivity. As you work 
through this book you will be introduced to many of these InDesign features, 
and by the completion of the book you will have developed preferences for 
how you interact with your InDesign work environment. You’ll also know 
how integrate those preferences into your everyday use of InDesign.

The Toolbox
The Toolbox is found on the left side of the document window. You can move 
the Toolbox to different areas of the document window by dragging the solid 
gray bar on the top of the panel (Visual 1–11A). Although you can’t reposition 
the location of the tools inside the Toolbox, you can customize the overall 
layout of the Toolbox. If you click on the arrows in the upper right corner, you 
can toggle the display of the Toolbox between a horizontal row (if the panel is 
undocked), or single or double vertical columns (Visuals 1–11A and B). When 
you hover your pointer over a tool, you will see the tool name and keyboard 
shortcut (Visual 1–11C). Select a tool by clicking on it. When a tool is selected, 
its icon becomes highlighted. Notice that some tools have a triangle in the 
lower right corner. When you click on these tools and hold the mouse down 
for a second, you will see more choices “hidden” underneath (Visual 1–11B). 
These hidden tools are related to the main tool displayed in the Toolbox.

Tools are grouped according to function: selection tools, drawing and type 
tools, transformation tools, and modification and navigation tools.
Pressing the Tab key alternately hides and shows the Tools and other 
panels. Pressing Shift+Tab displays the Tools, but hides the remaining 
panels. If the Toolbox becomes hidden on your document, go to the 
Menu bar, select Window>Tools. Or, select Window>Workspace>Reset 
(current Workspace). The Toolbox will return to its default location.
Using Panels
InDesign uses panels to organize commands and are stored, or docked, on the right 
edge of the workspace. As you become more familiar with InDesign, you’ll discover 
there are some panels you continually use. And there may be some panels you 
seldom use. InDesign has created preset workspaces intended to display panels that 
correspond with your particular workflow. InDesign allows you to customize the 
combination of panels to fit your preferences and the jobs you do. You can work in a 
panel while it is still grouped with other panels in vertical formation, or you can drag 
it out on the document area. Follow these steps to learn how to work with panels.
1. 
Choose each of the workspaces 
available in the workspace switcher 
pull down menu, found on the 
right end of the Application 
bar, above the Control panel 
(Visual 1–12). Notice that the 
panels on the right side of 
your InDesign window change 
according to the workspace you 
have selected. Panels are displayed 
in groups, in a vertical format on 
the right side of the InDesign 
window, in an area called the dock. 
Select the Advanced workspace, 
as you follow these steps.
2. 
Click on a panel’s name or icon 
and the panel window will open and close. Panels can also be opened with keyboard 
shortcuts. Press F5 (function key 5) and the Swatches panel will open. Press it again, and 
the panel will close.

3. 
Click on the grey bar on the top of the panel group and pull to the left. The entire panel 
group will be released from the dock. When the group is released, a circle appears in the 
upper left corner (Mac) or an X appears in the upper right corner (Windows). Click the 
circle or X, and the panel group will close. You can make the panel group reappear by 
choosing Reset Advanced in the workspace switcher on the Application bar (Visual 1–13).
4. 
Panel groups are broken down into sets, which are 
separated by double lines, as shown on the lower 
part of Visual 1–13. These sets can be moved in and 
out of the dock by dragging on the double lines 
above each set. Click on the double lines and move 
each set from the dock (Visual 1–14). A circular close 
button appears in the upper left corner (Mac) and 
an X appears in the upper right corner (Windows) 
of each individual set. Click on the name of an 
individual panel and drag the panel to the left. 
You have just created a single, floating panel.
5. 
Panels can be made even smaller, so that the label is 
hidden, by clicking and holding the left edge of the 
panel while moving it toward the icon (Visual 1–15).
6. 
 Choose Reset Advanced from the workspace 
switcher to reorganize your window. Pull 
the Swatches panel from the dock. Now, 
click on the double arrows in the upper 
right corner. This expands and collapses the 
panel window. Then, open the panel menu. 
Panel menus display additional options, 
specific to each panel (Visual 1–16).

Panels can be stacked vertically on the document 
window. You can also dock the panels to the left 
edge of your screen. Select a panel. Click on the 
panel’s name and drag it to the drop zone at the 
bottom of another panel. A blue bar appears as the 
panel enters the drop zone (Visual 1–17). Now, drag 
the panels into the dock on the left side of the screen.
When you are finished, reset the Advanced workspace.
Using Tools
Set your Toolbox so that it is displayed in a single 
column, down the left side of your document window. 
The top tool (black arrow) is the Selection tool. Use it 
when you want to select, resize, or move an entire item 
(frame, line, text path, etc.). The second tool down, 
(white arrow) is the Direct Selection tool. Use it when 
you want to select just part of an item, the points on an 
item’s path, the content inside the item, or to modify 
its shape. (If you are familiar with QuarkXPress, 
the Selection tool is similar to the Item tool and the 
Direct Selection tool is similar to the Content tool.)
Jump over the Page and Gap tools and you will come 
to the Type tool. You will spend much of your time 
using the Type tool—typing, editing, or working 
with tables. Because you’ll be using it so much, you’ll 
learn to use keyboard shortcuts to switch from the Type tool to other tools 
without going over to the Toolbox. This will make you very efficient. Below the 
Type tool is the Line tool. Use this tool for drawing straight or diagonal lines.
Jump over the Pen and Pencil tools and you will find the Rectangle Frame 
tool. Notice the little arrow in the lower right corner. This means that other 
tools are “hidden” underneath the tool that is showing. We will use several 
of these tools as we continue working on the document created earlier.
1. 
In the Toolbox, click on the Rectangle tool. Your cursor will turn into little cross 
hairs with a dot in the middle. Go back to your document, click your mouse 
button somewhere on the left side of your document, and make a rectangle 
by dragging your mouse down and to the right. Release the mouse.

Let’s take a look at the rectangle you have just drawn (Visual 1–19). The eight small 
hollow boxes at the corners and at each side of the rectangle are called selection 
handles. When the selection handles are visible, the item is considered active. Click 
somewhere else on your document. The selection handles disappear, meaning the 
item is not active. An item must be selected (active) in order to work with it. In 
addition to selection handles, shapes have bounding boxes. Bounding boxes indicate 
the outermost points of a shape, the “footprint.” The bounding box for the rectangle 
you have just drawn is the same dimension as the rectangle. Look at the odd-looking 
shape in Visual 1–19. The rectangle 
that delineates its outer edges is the 
bounding box. A bounding box always 
has four straight sides, no matter what 
shape you have drawn. If the circle 
shown in the Visual 1–19 was activated 
with the Selection tool, the bounding 
box would be displayed as a square.
2. 
Deselect the rectangle you drew earlier. Go back to the Toolbox and click on the 
Selection tool. Your cursor should now look like a black arrow (Visual 1–20A). Slowly 
move the Selection tool toward the edge of the rectangle (do not click the mouse 
button). When the arrow touches the edge, a small square appears next to the tail 
of the arrow (Visual 1–20B). This means you can now select the rectangle again. 
Click when the small box appears by the tail of the arrow and you will see your 
selection handles again. Your rectangle is now selected. Notice that when your 
rectangle is selected and you move your cursor over the edge of the rectangle 
(without clicking the button), the arrow icon loses its “tail” (Visual 1–20C).
3. 
With your rectangle selected, you can move the rectangle 
to a different place or change its size. To move it, click on 
the edge of the rectangle and drag it. Release the mouse 
button to “drop” the rectangle in the new location. To resize 
the rectangle, move the cursor over one of the selection 
handles. The icon turns into small opposing arrows, with a line 
in between (Visual 1–21). Drag the selection handles in, out, 
or diagonally to change the dimension of the rectangle.

Now, you’ll use shortcuts to make a document and to create and modify a rectangle.
1. 
Close, but don’t save the document you just made, by pressing Command+W
(Mac) or Control+W (Windows). Use keyboard shortcuts to make a new 
document: Command+N (Mac) or Control+N (Windows). When the New 
Document dialog box opens, accept the document defaults, including Letter 
for page size, and 0.5" for all margins. Choose the [Essentials] workspace.
2. 
Next, you will draw a rectangle, but instead of going over to the Toolbox, press 
the letter M. This will instantly select the Rectangle tool. Draw a rectangle and 
then press the letter A. You have now selected the Direct Selection tool. The Direct 
Selection tool differs from the Selection tool because you can modify just part of 
an object—one side, or one or more anchor points—instead of the whole item.
3. 
Modify the shape of your rectangle using the Direct Selection
tool by selecting and dragging the sides and anchor points. Your 
rectangle will quickly lose its rigid, 90-degree angles.
4. 
With your shape selected, bring the Direct Selection arrow slowly to 
the tiny box in the center of the object. Notice that the white arrow 
becomes a black arrow. Click and move the object around.
Always deselect an object when you are finished working on it. You can deselect 
an object by clicking any blank area in the document, or by using the keyboard 
shortcut: Shift+Command+A (Mac) or Shift+Control+A (Windows).
Placing Text into a Frame
You will appreciate your good typing and keyboard skills as you 
begin to spend more time working with text. In the next exercise, 
you will learn how to enter text and draw some basic shapes.
1. 
Close your document without saving it by pressing Command+W (Mac) or 
Control+W (Windows). Use the keyboard shortcut to make a new, one-page 
document that is 7" wide and 6" inches high (use the 0.5" default margins).

2. 
Notice that your document is landscape format, because it is wider than it is 
high. Press M to select the Rectangle tool and draw a rectangle. Now press T. 
Your cursor changes into a vertical bar with a small cross hair near the bottom 
and dotted lines around it (Visual 1–23). Click inside the rectangle and notice 
the blinking cursor in the upper left corner of the rectangle. Your rectangle has 
become a text frame, and the blinking cursor means you’re ready to type.
3. 
You can also create a text frame by dragging with the Type tool cursor. As you draw 
the frame, the width and height are displayed (Visual 1–24). When you release the 
mouse, you are ready to type. Type a sentence or two about yourself, your dog, 
or your weekend—anything you want. 
Highlight all the text with Command+A 
(Mac) or Control+A (Windows). There are 
other methods of selecting your text. For 
instance, you can drag and highlight text 
with your mouse, or choose Select All from 
the Edit menu, but those methods are slower. 
Keyboard shortcuts are always the way to go!
4. 
 With the text highlighted, you can use keyboard shortcuts to increase the size 
of the selected type. Hold down Shift+Command (Mac) or Shift+Control 
(Windows) and press the greater than key (>), six or seven times, and watch 
the size of your type get larger. You could use the Control panel to increase 
the size of the type, but using keyboard shortcuts is essential for efficiency. 
You can substitute the less than symbol (<), in combination with the same 
modifier keys, to reduce the type size. Keep your document open.
Stroke and Fill
A stroke is a line that goes around the edges of a shape, like a border; or around type, 
like an outline. A fill is a color that is placed inside a shape or type. Stroke and fill 
menus are conveniently located in 
the Control panel (Visual 1–25).

1. 
Press F to select the Frame tool and draw a rectangle on your document. By default, 
shapes drawn with the Frame tool have no fill or stroke. Click the arrow next to the Fill 
button on the Control panel (Visual 1–26). Slide down the menu of color swatches and 
choose the Red swatch (C=15, M=100, Y=100, K=0). The rectangle will be filled with Red.
2. 
Now you’ll add a Green border to the outside of the rectangle. With the rectangle still 
selected, click the arrow next to the Stroke icon, located below the Fill icon (Visual 1–26). 
Slide down the menu of color swatches and choose the Green swatch (C=75, M=5, 
Y=100, K=0). Now that you’ve selected the color, you can add a style. The default is a 
Solid line, but you can slide down the style menu and choose the stroke style that suits 
you. Directly above the Style field is the Stroke Width field. You may not understand 
what pt. means, but we’ll cover that in a later chapter. For now, simply pull down 
on the blue arrows next to the Stroke Width field to select a preset stroke width.
3. 
It’s just as easy to add a stroke or fill to text. Type a short phrase in your rectangle. 
Select the frame with the Selection tool. Click the arrow next to the Fill button. When 
the Swatches panel opens, click the Formatting affects text button (Visual 1–27). 
Then, select a color from the list. Then, select Stroke and add a color from the 
Stroke pull down menu. Choose a stroke width. Whenever you apply a stroke to 
text, make sure the width of the stroke doesn’t distort the shape of the letters.
▶ production tip
A stroke is applied to the 
outside of a frame; a fill is 
applied to the inside. If the 
stroke width is too small, 
the style may not show. 
If that happens, choose 
a larger stroke width.
VISUAL |1–26  |
Stroke and Fill controls are 
found in the Control panel. 
A red diagonal line indicates 
a stroke or fill of [None].
VISUAL |1–27  |
A stroke is not usually added 
to type because it can reduce 
redability. (This stroke is 
greatly exaggerated for 
demonstration purposes.)

4. 
Select the Line tool (the keyboard shortcut is a 
backslash, \). Click and drag to draw several diagonal 
lines on your document. Switch to the Selection tool 
and select any line. Notice the rectangular shape 
of the bounding box. Now, select the Line tool 
again, hold down the Shift key, and draw perfectly 
horizontal and vertical lines (Visual 1–28). By default, 
the line has a 1 point stroke. Lines do not have fills.
5. 
Hold down the Shift key and draw one more line, 
but do not release the mouse button. Instead, move 
the mouse to rotate the free end of the line in a circle, 
like hands on a clock. Notice how the line snaps to 
45-degree increments. The Shift key constrains lines 
to horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree increments. Now, 
choose a different stroke style, width, and color.
About Frames
InDesign includes two tools for making rectangular boxes called frames. One 
frame has an X in it, one doesn’t. Both frames can hold either pictures or 
text. When you click inside any frame with the Type tool, a blinking cursor 
will appear, which means the frame is ready for you to begin typing.
6.  Make a new document using the default 
settings. Use the Rectangle tool to draw a 
rectangle in the left half your document.
7.  Choose the Rectangle Frame tool (the box with 
the X inside it). You may also select this tool 
by pressing F. Draw a second rectangle on the 
right half of your document. There will be an 
X inside the new rectangle (Visual 1–30).
So, why are there two frame tools? In the days before computers, layouts were created 
by placing graphic elements on a pasteup board. The location and size of a photo 
would be indicated on the pasteup by a rectangle, with an X stretching from corner 
to corner. In today’s InDesign environment, a designer can create a layout, and use 
the Rectangle Frame tool, with the X, to indicate where the images will be placed. 
Text will be placed in frames without an X. These visual cues are particularly helpful 
if another person is going to add the photos and text to complete the project.

Navigating
Let’s do a little navigating around your document with the two frames. Your 
document sits in the middle of an area called the pasteboard. At the right and bottom 
of the pasteboard are scroll bars (Visual 1–31). 
You slide the scroll bars up and down, or 
right and left, to reposition your document 
inside the InDesign window. You can also 
click on the triangles to move your document 
around. If you are working in Windows, 
these triangles will be at either end of the 
scroll bars. If you are working on a Mac, the 
triangles will be in the lower right corner.
Another way to move your document around is to use the Hand tool. Whenever 
the Type tool is not active, you can hold down the spacebar to switch temporarily 
to the Hand tool (Visual 1–32). Click, and the Hand will turn into a little fist. Now 
drag with your mouse and the fist 
will grab on to your document 
and move it wherever you like.
To access the Hand tool while you 
are using the Type tool in an active 
frame, you press the Option (Mac) 
or Alt (Windows) key. (If you 
press the spacebar to access the 
grabber hand while using the Text 
tool, you will simply add spaces to 
the text you are working on.) You 
can also select the Hand tool in the Toolbox or by using the H shortcut key, but using 
the Spacebar (or Option/Alt) and mouse is probably faster and more convenient.
Managing Pages and Views
In the lower left corner of your document window is the Status bar. This bar displays 
the page number you are working on and the preflight status of a file. You can also 
move from page to page by clicking the Next Page, Previous Page, or Go To Page 
arrows on each side 
of the current page 
number (Visual 1–33).
VISUAL |1–32 |
Hold down the Spacebar and 
click to make the Hand tool 
turn into the grabber hand. If 
you are using the Type tool, 
access the grabber hand by 
pressing the Option (Mac) 
or Alt (Windows) key.
VISUAL |1–33 |
The Status bar, in the lower 
left corner, displays the current 
page number and makes it easy 
to move from page to page.

The Application Bar
Let’s move from the lower left corner of the InDesign workspace, to the area above 
the Control panel, called the Application bar. This multi-purpose utility houses many 
productivity controls. You already used one of them—the workspace switcher—when 
you chose a workspace from the upper right corner. Just to make sure we’re all on the 
same workspace, go to the workspace switcher and choose Essentials from the drop 
down menu. If you already have Essentials chosen, select Reset Essentials, instead.
Now, direct your attention to the left end of the Application bar, and 
we’ll take a look at some of its great features (Visual 1–34).
About Bridge:
Bridge, the first icon on the Application bar, is an application found in all 
the Adobe Suite members. Bridge helps you manage the images and other 
components in your projects. We won’t be covering Bridge in this book—
you can find out more about it at Menu>Help>InDesign Help.
Managing Your Document’s View
When you are viewing your document at its actual size, the zoom level is 100%. You 
can access the Zoom level preset list on the Application bar, next to Bridge, by clicking 
on the downward-pointing triangle to the right of the zoom level field. Notice that 
you can view your document from 5% all the way to 4000%! If none of those view 
percentages is just right, you can type any percentage in 
the zoom level field and press Return or Enter, and your 
document view will immediately change (Visual 1–35).
Another way to change your view is to use keyboard 
shortcuts. For a quick view of the document at 
actual size, press Command+1 (Mac) or Control+1 
(Windows). This method is quick and efficient, and 
after using it awhile, it becomes automatic. Other 
keyboard shortcuts for viewing options are shown 
in Visual 1–36. Practice using each of the keyboard 
shortcuts until using them becomes automatic.

|  Chapter 1 |
Access the Zoom tool in the Toolbox by 
pressing Z. Hold the Zoom tool directly 
over the place in your document you want 
magnified, and click. That area will come 
to the center of your screen. Hold down the 
Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) key and 
click to reduce the zoom percentage. Get in 
the habit of zooming in and zooming out, 
quickly and frequently. Too many beginning 
designers work with very small text at 100% view—or less! Give your eyes a break. 
Zoom into your document so you can comfortably see punctuation marks, where 
your cursor is, how many characters you have highlighted—all the small details of 
your document. After you have finished working up close, 
zoom out, using the appropriate keyboard shortcut.
When you are zoomed in on a document and click-hold 
the Hand tool, the page automatically zooms out. A 
red rectangle shows the part of the document you will 
view. When you release the mouse, the document will 
return to the previous zoom percentage (Visual 1–37).
Application Bar View Options
View Options is the next feature on the Application 
bar (Visual 1–38). This drop down menu allows you 
to turn on and off rulers, guides, and other page 
elements which will be explained in later chapters.
Screen Mode Options
The Screen Mode feature allows you to see how your job 
will look when it’s finished (Visual 1–39). In Normal 
mode, you will see all the margin guides and frame edges. 
When you switch to Preview, the distracting guides are 
hidden. Another way to quickly switch into Preview 
mode is to press the letter W. Of course, if a text frame is 
active you will actually type a W, so you should deselect 
everything before using the keyboard shortcut. You will 
find out about bleeds and slugs in Chapter 6. And we 
won’t be covering the Presentation mode or the Arrange 
Documents feature of the Application bar in this book.

The Application Frame
On the Mac, you can choose Application frame from Menu>Window>Application 
Frame. This feature groups all the workspace elements in a single window. If you 
are working with more than one application you can position each application 
in a frame side by side on the screen. As you become more familiar with 
InDesign, you will develop personal preferences for how you like to work.
Managing Document Windows
When the Application frame or bar are active, open InDesign documents are shown 
in document tab format across the title bar. As you click on each different tab, 
that document moves to the front, making it easy to switch between documents. 
The active document tab is white (Visual 1–40). If you have been following the 
exercises, you only have one open InDesign document, so you will only have one 
tab displayed. However, with multiple files open, tabbed documents work much 
like panels. You can undock a document by dragging its tab out of the group. 
You can rearrange the order of documents by dragging the tab to a new location 
in the group. When using the tabs to switch between documents, be careful not 
to click the × in the upper right corner, because this closes the document.
The Control Panel
And finally, directly below the Application bar is the Control panel. The Control 
panel offers quick and convenient 
ways to accomplish much of what 
you need to do in your documents. 
By default, the Control panel is 
docked above the title bar of your 
document. You can dock it to the 
bottom of the window, or change 
it to a floating panel, by choosing 
either of these options from the panel 
menu, located at the far right end 
of the Control panel (Visual 1–41).

Like most InDesign panels, tool tips will be displayed when you hover over an item 
with the pointer. The fields and options in the Control panel are like a chameleon, 
changing from Character formatting mode to Paragraph formatting mode, or to 
any number of other modes, depending on what type of object you have selected 
(Visual 1–42). The Control panel will display a variety of options, depending on 
your monitor size and resolution. For instance, if you are using InDesign on a laptop, 
fewer Control panel options will be displayed, than if you are using a large monitor. 
If the Control panel does not appear on your desktop, select Window>Control 
from the Menu bar. You will be using the Control panel continuously, and 
each of its options will be introduced as you progress through the chapters.
Customizing Your Workspace
Arrange the panels on your desktop where you want them to be. Place the Toolbox 
where it is most convenient for you. Even if you don’t yet have a preference for 
panel configurations, pull a couple panels out onto the desktop just for fun and note 
their names and placement. Choose Window>Workspace>New Workspace. In the 
New Workspace dialog, type 
Workspace 1 and press Return 
or Enter (Visual 1–43).
Now rearrange your 
desktop with different 
panels, and Toolbox 
location. Choose Window>Workspace>Reset Workspace 1 and 
Workspace 1 will instantly revert to its default setting.
The [New in CS5] workspace hides some menu items. When you need to use 
a menu item that is not displayed, go to Window>Workspace>Show Full 
Menus. You can create workspaces to customize your InDesign environment 
to just about any configuration you want. Very neat. Very organized.

Saving Your Work
Your old typewriter had one—and only one—advantage over word processing: 
Once you typed a word on your paper, it was there to stay! Not so with electronic 
page layout programs. You need to save your work and save it often.
To save your document, press Command+S (Mac) or Control+S (Windows) 
or select File>Save. The dialog box will ask you first of all what you want to 
name your document. The Save As (Mac) or File Name (Windows) field will be 
highlighted when the dialog box is displayed, so just begin typing the name you 
want for the document. Next, tell your computer where you want it saved: on the 
desktop? on your hard drive? on a server? in a folder? which folder? Be sure to 
remember where you save your document because you will need to find it later.
If you lose a document but know you 
saved it somewhere, go to File>Open 
Recent and see if it is in the list of 
recent documents (Visual 1–44). Or, 
you can do a Find or Search (if you 
remember the name of the file) and 
your computer will locate it for you.
Save and Save As
After you have saved a project the first time, pressing Command+S (Mac) 
or Control+S (Windows) automatically saves your document, with the 
edits you have made, in the same location and with the same name as your 
previous Save. Save As also saves your work, but the Save As dialog is displayed 
to allow you to rename and relocate your document (Visual 1–45).
For instance, you have been 
working on a Valentine’s Day 
ad for South Side Grocery. 
You complete the ad, save and 
print the document, and get 
the customer’s approval. The 
customer loves your layout 
and decides you should make 
a version for three other 
stores in the city. And all the 
other versions need to be 
done by 5:00 p.m. today!

|  Chapter 1 |
This is a great time to use Save As. Open the original file, named South Side Grocery. 
Immediately use Save As, and name the new file North Side Grocery. The South Side 
Grocery file remains unchanged, but you are now working on a different file—the 
North Side Grocery ad. When this ad is done you save it, print it, and again use Save 
As to name the next file West Side Grocery. The previous file, North Side Grocery, 
stays just as you left it while you complete the West Side Grocery ad, and so on. You 
can also use Save As to rename your document, such as North Side Grocery_Backup
and then save the backup version to a CD, flash drive, or a file server.
Save a Copy
The keyboard shortcut for Save a Copy is Command+Option+S (Mac) or 
Control+Alt+S (Windows). Save a Copy is a little different than Save As. 
Suppose you want to keep a visual record of each production step in a project. 
You begin the project and perform the first step. Use Save a Copy and name 
the file Step 1. Your original file is still on the screen and you continue on to the 
next step. When you finish this step, use Save a Copy and name this file Step 2. 
You will continue building your document, saving and naming incremental 
versions. Unlike Save As, the Save a Copy option allows you to continue 
working on the original file while the copy goes wherever you tell it to go.
How can Save a Copy come in handy? Let’s say it’s 10:15 a.m. and you are busy 
getting the Zaza Toys layout ready for a client meeting at 10:30 a.m. All of a 
sudden you get a huge brainstorm that will radically change the look of the 
layout. The client has already approved the layout you are just finishing and, 
since it’s due in 15 minutes, you don’t want to take the chance of messing it up. 
So you use the Save a Copy option and name the copy Client_Approved. This 
file, completed at 10:15 a.m., is now saved somewhere on your desktop, but the 
original Zaza Toys file is still open. You make all kinds of changes. You go wild.
Your creative director walks by to see if you are ready for the meeting that 
will begin in just a few minutes. She looks at your screen and gently but 
firmly suggests you change the document back to the way it was about 
10 minutes ago. In a few clicks, you have Client_Approved opened and 
printed. You arrive at the client meeting on time and unruffled.
Printing Your Document
When you are ready to print your document, press Command+P (Mac) or 
Control+P (Windows) or choose File>Print. There are many options displayed 
in the Print dialog box (Visual 1–47), but the first thing you need to do is select 
the printer you want to use on the General options page of the dialog. Now, select 
the Setup options page (in the list on the left side of the dialog box), set Paper Size

to Letter, and make sure Orientation is Portrait. If your document is smaller than 
8.5 × 11, your finished piece will look better if you set Page Position to Centered.
In the lower left corner is a shaded box with a white rectangle and the letter “P.” 
This is a preview of how the printer is set to print your document. The white 
area is the size of your paper. The “P” is the size of your document and is 
represented with a light shade of blue. If you change Paper Size to something 
other than letter, this preview will give you an idea of how your document will 
print, in relation to the size of the paper it will be printed on (Visual 1–47).

Summary
If you are already familiar with Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator, this 
chapter was an easy review. If learning Adobe InDesign is your first adventure 
into the world of digital page layout, this chapter covered a lot of new territory. 
Finding your way around the InDesign workspace was the focus of this 
chapter. The next chapter will build on these concepts. Like practicing the 
piano, using InDesign for at least 30 minutes each day will help solidify these 
basics and help pave the way for a continual increase in your skill level.

introduction
You are dreaming a designer’s worst nightmare. A weary vacationer has just come home 
and his mailbox is overflowing. He plops the stack of mail onto the kitchen counter and 
begins the sorting process. “Keep, throw, keep, keep, throw, throw…oh, this one looks 
interesting, maybe I’ll look at it later…” until the whole stack of mail has been separated. 
He picks up the stack of rejects and moves slowly to a designer’s nemesis—the circular file. 
You helplessly call out in your sleep, “Hey, don’t throw that stuff! I spent days designing 
those direct response mailers!” You watch your pieces fall into the dark abyss of the 
garbage can and you shudder as the lid closes, sealing the fate of all your hard work.
This “nightmare” is actually reality for many designers who do not know how to set type. It 
doesn’t take the average reader more than a glance to decide whether or not to read a printed 
piece. If a design doesn’t pass the “once-over” test, out it goes. That’s the bad news. The 
good news is that by picking up this book, you have taken the first step in learning how 
to use type as a powerful communication tool. And by the time you complete Exploring 
InDesign you will know how to correctly set type. In the first chapter you learned how to 
find your way around the InDesign workspace. This chapter will introduce you to basic 
typographic terms and concepts. Knowing both InDesign and typography will give you a 
competitive edge in the marketplace—and save your printed pieces from the garbage can!

An Eye-q Test
The ability to use type as a powerful design component is a distinguishing 
characteristic of an experienced designer. Visual 2–1 shows some examples of typical 
newspaper display ads. Each row shows two versions of the same ad. The only 
difference between each pair is how the type is used. Which example in each pair 
would you most likely read? Which examples successfully communicate the message?
If you selected “B” for each pair, you have just proven the power of good 
typesetting. Typesetting should enhance readability and strengthen the message. 
The type on a page should attract the reader’s attention and create a visual 
path for the eye to follow. How you use type can make or break a layout!

First Things First
When a client gives you a rough layout, how exactly do you get started? First, you 
must read the text and understand the purpose of the piece you are going to design. 
Determine which information is most important. Second, never assume that the copy 
provided to you is totally accurate. Take responsibility for ensuring the document’s 
accuracy and ultimate success by making it a habit to check the following items:
▶Proofread phone numbers and zip codes. Test web addresses.
▶Ask if product names require a ™ or ® symbol.
▶Check that names are spelled correctly throughout the document.
▶ Consult a calendar to verify days and dates. Check that day, date, 
and time information is consistent throughout the document.
▶Proofread headings and subheads because they are 
often overlooked in the proofing process.
If the client gives you actual samples of the printed pieces to re-create, 
look for ways the pieces could be improved and discuss those changes 
with the client. Often project samples are filled with typesetting mistakes 
in form and type use. Do not duplicate poor typesetting! You are the 
professional—the client is coming to you for your insight and expertise.
Finally, ask how the job will be printed and finished. Will it be drilled (three-hole 
punched)? Will it be stitched (spine stapled)? Will it be mailed? Will there be photos 
and colors? These specifics will determine how you build the InDesign document.

Select an Appropriate Typeface
Once you understand the purpose and the specifications of the project, you must 
put some thought into the personality you want the piece to express. The blend of 
typeface, image, layout, and color will create a distinct personality in each piece you 
design. Personalities can range from formal and powerful, to wacky and whimsical. 
The typeface you select will play a big part in communicating that personality.
Let’s say you just inherited a huge amount of money and can now have the cosmetic 
surgery you always dreamed of. You look in the yellow pages to choose a cosmetic 
surgeon. Which surgeon will you choose from the list shown in Visual 2–3?
Selecting Typeface and Point Size
The following exercise will focus on the basics of text handling in InDesign. 
Launch InDesign. Follow these steps to create a sample document.

Press Command+N (Mac) or Control+N (Windows) to create a new document.
The New Document dialog box will open. Your settings should be:
Document Preset: [Default]
Intent: Print
Number of Pages: 1
Facing Pages: Off (Facing pages is another way of saying two-page spreads, similar to 
the left- and right-hand pages of a book. If you changed your InDesign defaults in the
Getting Started section in Chapter 1, this should already be turned off.)
Master Text Frame: Off
Page Size: Letter
Width: 8.5 in., Height: 11 in.

Press the Return or Enter key. Remember, it’s easier and faster to 
press the Return key rather than to click OK with your mouse.
3. 
Your document will appear in a window with two rulers—one at the top and the other 
along the left side of your window. The upper left corner of your document should be 
at zero on the horizontal ruler, and the upper right corner should be at 8.5. Along the 
vertical ruler, the upper left corner of your document should be at zero and the lower 
left corner should be at 11. Your document should look like Visual 2–4. You will also 
notice a colored line around the inside of your document. This is the half-inch margin 
you set in the New Document dialog box. (If you did not change your InDesign defaults 
in the Getting Started section in Chapter 1, your measurements will be displayed in 
picas. This measurement system will be discussed later, and we will cover changing 
the ruler units of measure in the next chapter, so don’t worry about them for now.)
Adding Text
4. 
Use the keyboard shortcut T to select the Type tool from the Toolbox. Put your 
cursor inside the upper left margin of your document, and then click and drag 
a text frame down and across the page. Wherever you stop will determine the 
size of your frame. If your frame is too small or you don’t like the shape of it, hold 
down Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) and press the letter Z. This is one 
of the best shortcuts to know—Undo. InDesign allows you unlimited undos. 
(Don’t you wish your life had unlimited undos?) Repeat drawing frames and 
“undoing” them until your frame stretches nicely from the left to right margins.

5. 
Make sure a blinking cursor is in your frame. If you don’t see a blinking cursor,
check to see that you have the Type tool selected and click inside the frame. Type 
a few paragraphs about the fondest memories you have of elementary school.
Rule #1:  Don’t press the spacebar twice at the end of sentences when using 
proportional type. One of the first rules you may have learned in junior high typing 
class was to put two spaces between sentences by pressing the spacebar twice after each 
period. This is the first habit you will need to break when using InDesign. The practice 
of using two spaces between sentences began in the days of typewriters. Type on old-
fashioned typewriters was monospaced, which means that each letter was allotted the 
same amount of space in the text line whether it was an i or an m. The extra space was 
inserted to visually separate sentences. With electronic publishing, most of the fonts 
used are proportionately spaced, which means that each letter, character, or symbol has 
been allocated just the right amount of space. Rule #2:  Enter only one Return after 
each paragraph. After typing three or four sentences, press the Return key once 
and type three or four more sentences about something else. Pressing the Return key 
more than once is the second habit you will have to break. With the old typewriter 
(and with some low-end software programs), you pressed the Return key twice to 
separate paragraphs. We will learn how to add extra spacing between paragraphs in a 
later chapter, but start getting into the habit of not pressing Return more than once.
6. 
If your text frame is too small to contain all the text, you will see a small, red square 
with a plus sign in the lower right corner of the frame indicating the text is overset. An 
overset symbol means you will need to make the frame larger, or modify the amount 
or size of the copy. It’s easy to resize a frame when using the Type tool. Pressing the 
Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) key will change the cursor to a single- or 
double-headed arrow, and make frame handles appear. Drag on any handle to 
resize the frame. Release the Command or Control key, and the Type tool cursor 
reappears. Notice that a text frame looks different than a rectangle frame (Visual 2–5). 
The extra boxes on a text frame are the in port and out port indicators, and will be 
discussed further in Chapter 4. Next, you will learn how to change the typeface and 
the type size. This project continues after a brief description of the Control panel.

appears in the out port, it 
means the text is overset.

Using the Control Panel to Change Typefaces
When you select the Type tool, the Control panel will display either the 
Character or the Paragraph Formatting Controls with the most frequently 
needed functions grouped on the left side (Visual 2–6). In Chapter 1, you were 
introduced to the Control panel, now we’ll look at this context-sensitive tool 
bar in more detail. Many of the text and paragraph functions can be accessed in 
either the Character or Paragraph Formatting mode of the Control panel. All 
of these functions are also available on other panels that you access from the 
Window menu. But it’s faster to use the Control panel to modify paragraphs 
and text, rather than opening a panel from Window >Type & Tables.
To change a typeface, select the Type tool and then click the Character Formatting 
Controls icon on the Control panel. Highlight the text by dragging the cursor over 
the passage you wish to change. The current type family name will be displayed in 
the upper field (Visual 2–7). There are several ways to select a new typeface. The 
most common method is to click the menu control to the right of the Type Family 
field and move up or down the list to select the name of the font you desire. Your font 
list will display a sample of each typeface. Each font listing is a separate type family.

the Character Formatting Controls of the Control panel.
The Control panel’s options vary, depending on what you select. In 
this example, an object has been selected with the Selection tool.

On a Macintosh, triangles at the right end of family names indicate type styles are 
available in the family. Visual 2–8 shows the type family, Helvetica, with two type 
style options, Regular and Bold. With a long list of fonts, scrolling through typeface 
names beginning with A to get to those beginning with Z will be time consuming. 
A quick way to select a typeface is to type the first letter of the typeface in the Type 
Family field. InDesign will automatically jump to the first typeface beginning with 
that letter. For instance, if you type a T for Times, the list would jump to the first 
typeface in the list beginning with T, making it much easier to quickly scroll to Times.
7. 
Highlight part of your text and change it to Helvetica and change the rest to Times. 
With the Type tool active, select all the text in your box by using the keyboard 
shortcut Command+A (Mac) or Control+A (Windows). Look in the Type Family field 
and you will see that the field is blank. A blank field means there are two or more 
different values for that field in your selected text—in this case, Times and Helvetica. 
With all the text still selected, change all the type back to Times by selecting the 
font name from the type family list. Now, Times appears in the Type Family field.
Changing the Type Style
A type family is a collection of related typefaces in different weights called type styles. 
To change a type style, highlight the text, and select the type style from the Type 
Style field underneath the Type Family field in the Control panel (Visual 2–7).

Changing the Size of Type
To the right of the Type Family is the Font Size field (Visual 2–9). The default 
type size is set at 12 points. Type specifications are measured in points and 
picas. Twelve points equal one pica. One inch equals 72 points or 6 picas.
8. 
There are several ways you can change the point size of selected text. One is to 
highlight the value in the Font Size field, enter a new value, and then press Return. 
Another is to use the controls on the right or left side of the Font Size field to change 
the point size in 1-point increments or to one of the preset sizes (Visual 2–9). But 
when working in InDesign, you want to do things as quickly and efficiently as 
possible. The fastest way to increase point size is to highlight the text and press 
Command+Shift+> (Mac) or Control+Shift+> (Windows). Each time the greater 
than key is pressed the point size will increase. To decrease the point size, press 
Command+Shift+< (Mac) or Control+Shift+< (Windows). These shortcuts will 
increase or decrease the type size by a specific amount set in the Units & Increments 
Preferences (the default is 2 points; we changed the default to 1 point in the 
Getting Started section in Chapter 1). If you also hold down the Option (Mac) 
or Alt (Windows) key, the point size will change in increments of five times the 
preference setting. Experiment with these techniques as you modify your text. The 
exercise will continue after a discussion of leading, so don’t close your document!
Changing Leading
The distance between one line of type to the next is called leading (rhymes with 
“sledding”). Each line of type sits on an imaginary line called a baseline. Like 
type size, leading is measured in points, from baseline to baseline. Knowing 
how to adjust the space between lines is important. Depending on how it 
is applied, leading can increase or decrease readability. If it is too tight, the 
individual lines of type blend together, making reading difficult. If leading is 
too loose, each text line stands alone, which can reduce comprehension.
If you changed the InDesign preferences described in the
Getting Started section in Chapter 1, using the keyboard shortcut 
will change point size in 1-point increments. If you didn’t change the 
InDesign preferences, point size will change in 2-point increments.

Auto and
Absolute Leading
There are two types of leading: auto leading 
and absolute leading. Auto (automatic) leading 
is just what the name implies: determined 
automatically by InDesign. By default, the 
point size of the text is multiplied by 120% to 
get the leading value. (The default setting for 
auto leading is 120%, but you can change the percentage in the Justification dialog 
box.) For example, if type size is 10, auto leading will be 12 points (10 ×120% = 12). 
With auto leading, as the size of type increases, the leading value also increases—
automatically. Using Auto leading can give text passages an “airy” look, which 
may not be desirable. For the most control over line spacing you will want to use 
absolute leading. With absolute leading, you enter a value in the Leading field. Once 
that value is entered, leading remains the same—unless you choose to change it!
Leading can be positive (when the leading value is greater than the type size), 
negative (when the leading value is less than the type size), or set solid (when the 
leading and type size values are equal). You will usually use positive leading in 
body copy, and negative or solid leading with large type (called display type).

The Leading field is below the Font Size field on the 
Control panel (Visual 2–11). Highlight the text passage 
and experiment with absolute leading by entering 
a value in the Leading field. Also experiment with 
applying the preset leading values. An alternative (and 
very fast) method to change 
leading is to select the text, 
hold down the Option
(Mac) or Alt (Windows) key, 
and click the Up or Down Arrow keys. The 
leading value will change in increments set in your 
preferences. You have now completed this exercise.
Points, Picas, and Markup
Markup is a universal system of coding providing written 
direction to people who work with type. Basic markup 
includes three measurements, written much like a math 
equation. The type size (specified in points) is listed first, 
as the numerator, and leading (also specified in points) as 
the denominator.
Line length or measure, follows the × and is 
usually measured in picas. If you are given a 
marked-up document you immediately know 
what to enter in the various fields in the Control 
panel. Markup will be used in projects throughout 
this book. Visual 2–13 shows an example of a 
passage set according to markup specifications.
The measurement system of picas and points may be 
new to you. Six picas equal one inch. Twelve points 
equal one pica. An inch is broken down into 72 tiny 
point-sized increments. The pica-point measurement 
system is ideal for setting type because we are usually 
working in small units of measure. It is easier to 
visualize how 5 points of leading will look, rather than 
a leading value of 0.069444, its equivalent in inches.

type basics
WHAT IS A “FONT”?
In the early days of printing, type was set 
by hand, letter by letter. A printer needed an 
actual piece of metal type for each letter and 
symbol in every size of any given typeface. 
The collection of all the characters, numbers, 
symbols and punctuation of a particular 
typeface in a specific point size was called a 
font. Our modern typefaces are not metal but 
digital, and you don’t purchase a new font 
for each point size you plan to use. Today, 
the terms font and typeface are often used 
interchangeably, as in the case of this textbook.
SERIF AND SANS SERIF FACES
Serifs are tiny finishing strokes on the end of 
the letter. Typefaces are classified as either serif 
(with serifs) or sans serif (without serifs).
ONE BIG, HAPPY TYPE FAMILY
Just like members of our own family, these 
related typefaces from the ITC Garamond 
family come in all shapes and weights.

One helpful tool for getting a visual 
“feel” for the pica-point system is an 
E-gauge. Use it to estimate the point 
size of type and measure line lengths. 
Available in many styles, they can 
usually be found at art supply stores. 
Generally, E-gauges have a pica and 
point scale and a series of E’s that 
descend in size. You estimate the type 
size by comparing a capital letter with 
the various size E's on the E-gauge.
Putting It All Together
Let’s use the Control panel as we put 
together another simple project. In 
this project you will make a 5" × 3" 
custom-size document to create an 
information card. When creating 
projects, first complete the typing. 
Then, change all the type to the 
most frequently used typeface, point 
size, and leading. Finally, fine-tune 
individual words and passages of type.

A New System of Measurement
Measuring and placement will be covered in detail in Chapter 4. But now is a good 
time to explain how units of measure work inside InDesign’s panel fields. When 
your document is set to measure in inches and you want to set a value in points, 
simply replace the number and measurement suffix (1 in) with the new value and 
measurement suffix. In the case of points, enter 6 points with a p before the number 
as in p6. For picas, the p follows the number; so 8 picas would be 8p. If the document 
preference is set to points or picas and you want to enter a unit of measurement in 
inches, you will need to type the number plus the suffix in or the quotation mark (").

Changing the Units of Measure
Let’s change the document’s units of measurement preferences. Press the 
Control key, and click on the horizontal ruler (Mac), or right-click on 
the horizontal ruler (Windows). Choose a different unit of measurement. 
Do the same with the vertical ruler. That’s how easy it is to change the 
measurement system used in any document. Using this method, you can 
switch back and forth between measurement systems whenever you want.
Using Fields to Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide
When you are using the Selection tool (black arrow) and 
select an object, you will notice that the Control panel 
changes to display X, Y, W, and H fields. The W and H 
fields stand for the width and height of the selected object. 
InDesign allows you to perform addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division calculations on values, right 
in the field. For instance, let’s say your document’s measurement system is 
set to inches and you have a 4-inch rectangle, but want to add 5 points to the 
width. With the rectangle selected, place the cursor in the W field (after the 4 in 
value), type +p5 (5 points) and then press Return. Five points will be added to 
the rectangle’s width dimension and the resulting number in the W field will be 
converted to inches (4.0694 in). When performing calculations in fields, use the 
hyphen (-) to subtract, the asterisk (*) to multiply, and the slash (/) to divide.
InDesign converts the dimension typed in a Control panel field to the current 
unit of measurement. For instance, if you are working in picas and enter 1", 
the value in the Control panel will read 6 picas when you press Return or Tab. 
When your document is set to one measurement system and you want to input 
a value in a different measurement system, you must type that measurement’s 
suffix. In the last example, the inches suffix (in or ") would need to be typed 
in the field, because the document’s unit of measurements is set to picas. 
Conversely, if your document is set to measure in inches, you must add a p
after the number to indicate picas, or before the number to indicate points.
Working with Text in a Frame
By now you know that you can use the Type tool to create a frame for text. As 
soon as you release the mouse a blinking cursor is wagging its tail at you, 
eager for you to begin typing. In the next project, you will incorporate text 
frame options as you create a stylish bookmark. Visual 2–19 shows how the 
text of the bookmark has plenty of room inside the bordered text frame. 
Creating “breathing space” around type is an important skill to learn!
The width will be 
divided by 3.

Using the Glyphs Panel
7. 
Select all of your text. Center the type horizontally by selecting it and 
pressing Shift+Command+C (Mac) or Shift+Control+C (Windows).
8. 
Add the decorative ornament. The decorative shape on the bookmark is called a glyph.
Glyphs are characters, numerals, punctuation, ornaments, or anything else included in 
a type font. When you choose Glyphs from the Type menu, the Glyphs panel will open 
and display the entire list of characters and ornaments included in the active font. In 
the lower left corner of the panel is a drop down menu for selection other fonts. Click 
on the arrow to the right of the font name and your system’s entire font collection will 
show up in the font list. Go ahead, scroll through the list and examine the glyphs from 
other fonts. You can magnify the glyphs in the panel by clicking the icon of the large 
mountain in the lower right corner and use the scroll bars on the right side of the panel 
to view all the glyphs on 
display. Each typeface’s glyphs 
are organized into categories. 
For easier viewing, smaller 
groups of glyphs can be 
shown by making a selection 
from the drop down menu 
located at the top left of the 
panel (Visual 2–20). To insert 
a glyph in your document, 
highlight the Z you typed 
earlier as a placeholder 
and then double-click 
a glyph from the Glyphs panel and that 
symbol will replace the highlighted Z. The 
glyph shown in the example is found in Adobe Caslon Pro.
9. 
If it is not still highlighted, double-click the glyph you inserted in your bookmark 
project. On the Control panel, click the Character symbol and increase the 
point size and leading. The glyph shown in the project example is 100/125.
10. 
Give the document a final proof. Is everything spelled correctly? Is the size 
of the bookmark 2 × 7 inches? Is the combination of the typeface and 
selected glyph pleasing to the eye? Always give your projects an additional 
“once-over” before going to print. You will also want to look carefully at your 
project after it is printed. You will see things on the hard copy that you 
may miss on the computer screen. Make your edits and print again.

▶ TECHNIQUES
Fills and strokes can add interest to a 
layout. To add a fill, first click the object 
with the Selection tool. Then, click the Fill 
icon on the Control panel and choose a fill 
color from the fly-out menu.
To add a stroke, select the object with 
the Selection tool and click the Stroke 
icon on the Control panel. Choose a 
stroke color from the fly-out menu.
The stroke Weight field allows you to 
change the thickness of the stroke. You 
can increase the thickness in increments 
of 1 point, or use the preset values from 
the control on the right side of the field.
Use the Style field to add interest to your 
frame. Stroke styles include dots, dashes, 
diamonds, waves. If you don’t see a 
style that has been applied, be sure the 
stroke has a color, or increase its weight.

The Production Sequence
An efficient method of constructing any project is summarized in these seven steps:
1. 
Format the correct size. It would seem that having the correct document size 
or frame size would be simple, but many errors are made during this initial step! 
An easy method of creating a frame to the exact size is to select the Rectangle 
or Rectangle Frame tool and simply click on your document. A window will 
pop open, and you can enter the measurement values for your shape.
1. 
Add and align the outer stroke as needed. By default, a stroke’s width 
is split on each side of an object’s path (see bottom of previous page). 
Consequently, when a stroke is added to an object, the dimensions 
of the object change. In future chapters, you will learn how to adjust 
the width and height of an object. For now, simply open the Stroke 
panel from the dock and with the object selected, click the Align 
Stroke to Inside icon and use the W and H coordinates to recheck 
your frame measurements. We’ll discuss coordinates in Chapter 4.
1. 
Create a text inset. When a frame has a stroke, it usually needs a text inset to keep 
the type away from the edge. Press Command+B (Mac) or Control+B (Windows) to 
open the Text Frame Options dialog box and add an inset. Do this before typing!
1. 
Typing. Remember to type first and format later! As you’re typing, press the 
Return key only one time at the end of paragraphs. Type a z to hold an insertion 
spot for any glyphs. Don’t worry how your text initially looks—you will fix it 
later. It is always good to save your document after this step is completed!
1. 
Specify the character formatting. First, adjust the point size, font, and style. 
Then adjust the leading. Use keyboard shortcuts whenever possible.
1. 
Specify the paragraph formatting. We’ll work on paragraph formatting 
in a future chapter, but here are a few tips for now. If your copy consists of 
continuous, narrative text, y ou should not press Return at the end of each 
line, but let the text automatically flow to the next line. If your copy is made 
up of individual text lines and different point sizes, placing a Return at the 
end of each line will allow for the greatest flexibility in adjusting leading.
1. 
Proof your work carefully and print. Proof the hard copy after printing.

Good and bad production habits are formed early 
in the process of learning software. After years 
in the classroom, I have identified characteristics 
of students who achieve software proficiency.
1.  Students who achieve proficiency use the 
software on a daily basis. Daily repetition 
secures techniques and keyboard shortcuts 
into long-term memory banks. Students who 
complete a lesson, but don’t use the software 
until the next class session, always struggle 
with essential functions covered previously.
2.  Students who achieve proficiency recognize 
the importance of learning any technique 
and memorizing shortcuts that will increase 
speed. Avoid using the menu bar to access 
panels—it’s a hard habit to break. Use 
keyboard shortcuts whenever possible.
Here are some tips from the masters:
 
▶Create your default document preset 
with no document open. Press 
Command+Option+P (Mac) or Control+Alt+P 
(Windows) and specify your parameters. 
This will allow you to turn default 
settings, like facing pages, on or off.
 
▶A quick way to highlight any field 
is to click on its label (left of the 
field) rather than the field itself.
 
▶Most fields also allow you to increase or 
decrease the field value by pressing the 
Up or Down Arrow keys on the keyboard.
 
▶When the OK button is highlighted in 
a dialog box, press Return rather than 
moving your mouse to click OK.
 
▶Type first, and begin formatting text 
after the typing is completed.
 
▶If your laptop doesn’t have separate 
function keys, press the fn key as 
you choose a number key.
▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
Summary
We covered a lot of ground in this chapter. You were introduced to basic typesetting terminology: 
typeface, type style, font, serif and sans serif typefaces, leading, markup, picas , and points. Three 
important typesetting practices were covered: one space between sentences, one return after 
paragraphs, and type first, format second. Typesetting techniques such as changing typefaces, point 
size, and leading, inserting glyphs, and centering type were introduced. You learned to use a text frame 
inset with type in a stroked box. You changed the units of measurement, created containers for text 
using both the Frame and Type tools, modified the dimensions of a text box using the Control panel, and 
added a stroke of varying widths and styles. You honed your production skills by memorizing and using 
shortcut keys. But we’ve only just begun. Now you are ready to begin the fine art of setting type.

▶ CHAPTER 2 PROJECTS
At first glance, these projects may look complicated, but they aren’t! You have learned the skills necessary 
to complete them—you will need to remember how to apply those skills. As you work through projects, 
you will notice that they don’t have the same level of step-by-step instruction as those projects within each 
chapter. This is deliberate. When you get your first design job, projects will not come with instructions—
you will need to demonstrate your problem-solving abilities and software proficiency on a daily basis. 
As you progress through this textbook and your skill improves, the directions with each project will only 
include the basic specifications needed to create the project. Find the project source files in the 02 Artwork 
and Resources folder on the accompanying CD.

introduction
Sometimes it’s tempting to cut corners. When working on that design job for your aunt, or doing a 
“freebie” for a volunteer organization, you may be tempted to throw typographic principles to the 
wind and just slam out the job. You may be able to get away with poor typesetting—occasionally. 
But sooner or later, your boss, creative director, or pre press technician will open your digital files 
and be appalled at your unprofessional and unorthodox production techniques. You don’t want 
to gain a reputation as a designer with excellent design capabilities, but horrible production and 
typography skills! That’s why it’s so important to develop good production habits right from the start.
Design projects can range from pizza coupons to annual reports. You should incorporate basic 
typesetting standards in all the projects you do. High-end jobs undoubtedly go beyond the 
basics and require more time and effort to incorporate precise specifications, styles, baseline 
grids, and so on. You will learn to match the level of typesetting with the level of the project—
but only after you thoroughly understand the basics of production and typography.
Putting type on a page without incorporating typographic principles is merely 
word processing. Creating text that enhances communication, while incorporating 
correct typography, is an art. Welcome to the fine art of setting type.

The Anatomy of Type
My husband worked in his father’s farm machinery business as he was growing up. 
While most of us can correctly identify the slow-moving machine we pass on the 
road as a tractor, my husband can still identify the make, model, and era of almost 
any tractor he sees. Because he was surrounded by machinery on a daily basis, 
he learned how to identify specific features and differentiate between models.
The process of identifying typefaces works the same way. First, you learn to 
classify type as sans serif or serif. Then, you begin to recognize that different 
typefaces have different personalities. (Remember the example of choosing 
your cosmetic surgeon in Chapter 2?) But before you can go deeper into type 
identification and selection, you will need to recognize the nuances of the 
anatomical parts that make up letters. It’s difficult to discuss typeface selection 
with a person who says: “I need a letter g that has an upper part and a curved 
thing-a-ma-bob on the bottom.” Because choosing a typeface is a critical step in 
any project, we begin this chapter by discussing the anatomical parts of a letter.
As presented in Chapter 2, each line of type sits on an imaginary 
line called a baseline. Other structural points of reference, with 
which you should become familiar, are shown in Visual 3–1.
▶X-height: the distance from the baseline to the top of a lower case x
▶Mean line: a horizontal line drawn parallel to the baseline at the x-height
▶Cap height: the space from the baseline to the top of a capital letter
▶Ascender: parts of a letter that extend above the mean line
▶Descender: letter parts that extend below the baseline
▶Descent: the distance from the baseline to the bottom of the longest descender
▶Ascent: the distance from the baseline to the top of the highest ascender
▶Point size: determined by adding the ascent and descent

Calculating Point Size
Point size is not determined by measuring an upper case E. Instead, point size is 
calculated by measuring the distance from ascent line to the descent line. Variations 
in these measurements, from typeface to typeface, can make a 25-point font in one 
typeface look much different than a 25-point font in another typeface. Compare 
the size of the lower case letters in the two type samples shown in Visual 3–2.
Anatomical Parts of a Letter
The anatomical parts of letters deal with letter structure, shape, and 
finish. Although some anatomical parts are specific to one or two letters, 
most appear in many letters. Although not complete, the charts shown in 
Moving Toward Mastery on the next two pages provide the most common 
letter parts. When you can identify the nuances in the structural makeup 
of a letter, you become better at identifying and choosing typefaces.
Often a client will bring in a printed sample for you to match. Finding 
just the perfect font match can be time consuming. You can speed up 
that process by using an online font identification site such as:
www.identifont.com
This site narrows your search through thousands of typefaces by asking 
you questions about the anatomical features of specific letters. The 
database sorts through the possible options based on your responses and 
ultimately gives you likely typeface matches from which to choose.

Understanding Hidden Characters
When you press a key that does not produce a letter, number, or punctuation mark—
for example, the Spacebar, the Tab key, or the Return key—a hidden character is 
placed in your document. By default, hidden characters are not visible. You can make 
the hidden characters in your document visible by pressing Command+Option+I
(Mac) or Control+Alt+I (Windows). This keyboard shortcut is a toggle shortcut, 
which means you use the same key sequence to turn hidden characters on or off. 
Different hidden characters are represented on the screen by different symbols. 
When hidden characters are turned on, you will see many tiny symbols on your 
screen, but they won’t print. Your computer thinks a space between letters or a 
return at the end of a line is a character, just like a letter or number or punctuation 
mark, and treats it as such. Memorize the hidden character symbols shown in 
Moving Toward Mastery, above. By doing so, you can see your documents as 
your computer sees them. Not only do hidden characters show the details of 
how your document was constructed, they tell even more about your typesetting 
abilities. Your supervisor or coworkers can take one look at the hidden characters 
in your document and have a good estimate of your software proficiency.

How InDesign Defines Paragraphs
Now that you can read hidden characters, you are ready to set type in 
paragraphs. One thing you will always want to remember is this: A paragraph 
is defined by pressing the Return key (Mac) or the Enter key (Windows).
Each time you press the Return key you create a paragraph, whether you have 
typed a whole page or just one letter. From studying the chart of hidden character 
symbols shown on the previous page, you already know that a paragraph symbol 
looks like this: . If you have hidden characters turned on, each time you press 
Return, this symbol will show and you will have created a new paragraph. (I work 
with hidden characters turned on most of the time, because I want to see my 
document as the computer sees it!) Look at the two passages in Visual 3–3. How 
many paragraphs are in frame A? How many are in frame B? Even though the copy 
in frame A looks identical to the copy in frame B, it is actually 13 paragraphs, while 
column B is only three: a headline, and two paragraphs of body copy. Each  symbol 
represents a paragraph. The Return or Enter key was pressed at the end of each line 
in frame A, creating many more paragraphs than necessary. This is called setting 
line for line. The majority of the time, you will want to use the Return key only at 
the end of a whole paragraph so that the software will manage the line endings.
Occasionally you will need to break a line manually within a paragraph. 
Look at the third line in the last paragraph of frame B. It has a different 
symbol at the end of the line. This symbol (¬) represents a soft return, and 
is created by pressing Shift+Return (Mac) or Shift+Enter (Windows). Here’s 
another important rule to remember: A soft return breaks the line, but does 
not create a new paragraph. The distinction between paragraph returns (or 
hard returns) and soft returns (forced line breaks) is critical to understand, 
because they determine how InDesign applies paragraph formatting options.

How to Add Space Between Paragraphs
In the following exercise you will learn how to add extra space between paragraphs. 
This is the technique you should use, rather than placing double returns 
between paragraphs!
1. 
Create a new document: 8.5" × 11", all margins 0.5".
2. 
Press F to select the Rectangle Frame tool. Draw a rectangle from the upper left to the 
lower right margin. Select the Type tool and click in the frame to make it a text frame.
3. 
Open the Context menu and choose Fill with 
Placeholder Text. Text should flow into the text frame. 
Don’t worry about trying to read it, placeholder 
text is a term for text that is used to “take the place” 
of the final copy. It is useful for showing where the 
finished text will be placed and makes the document 
look more complete. The placeholder text will be 
replaced by the actual copy later. (Placeholder 
text can also be accessed from the Type menu.)
4. 
Turn on hidden characters by pressing 
Command+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Alt+I 
(Windows). You will probably see several paragraph 
return symbols in the text. There should be a # symbol 
at the end of the text indicating the end of the story. (If 
your text doesn’t show any paragraph symbols, insert 
two or three paragraphs returns throughout the text.)
5. 
Add some soft returns at the end of three or four lines.
6. 
Use the techniques described in the box to 
the left to practice highlighting text. Selecting 
paragraphs with four clicks is a good way to make 
sure that everything in the paragraph is selected, 
including the paragraph return symbol at the end 
of the paragraph. If you simply drag the cursor 
to highlight the characters in the paragraph, it 
is easy to miss the ending paragraph symbol.

7. 
Select all the text by pressing Command+A (Mac) or Control+A (Windows). 
Choose a typeface and make the type 10-point with 11-point leading.
8. 
Now you’ll add space between paragraphs 
using the Paragraph Formatting Controls. 
Visual 3–4 shows the Space After field. Type p7 
(meaning 7 points) in the field. When you press 
Return, InDesign converts the point measurement 
to the equivalent measurement in inches and 
adds that amount of space after every paragraph. You can use any measurement system 
to enter numeric values in fields, as long as you also enter the corresponding unit 
abbreviation such as in for inches or mm for millimeters. When using points and picas, 
if the p is before the number it means points. When the p follows a number, it means 
picas. Therefore, 5p means 5 picas, p5 means 5 points, and 12p6 means 12 picas, 6 points.
9. 
Examine your copy to see the breather space between the paragraphs. 
Remember to use Command+ Z (Mac) or Control+ Z (Windows) to undo 
any mistakes. Keep this document open—there’s more practice ahead.
▶
 When you are using the Type tool and working in 
an active text frame, you can temporarily access 
the Selection tool by holding down the Command
(Mac) or Control (Windows) key. As soon as the 
Command or Control key is released, the arrow 
becomes the I-beam text cursor again. Try this a 
few times.
▶
 When you are using the Type tool and working in 
an active text frame, you can quickly switch to 
the Selection tool by pressing ESC.
▶
 When the Selection tool is active, double-click on 
your copy to instantly go to the text cursor.
▶
 When you are not using the Type tool, you can 
access the grabber hand by holding down the 
Spacebar. When you are using the Type tool, you 
access the grabber hand by holding down the
Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) key.
▶
 Alternatively, you can press both the Option 
(Mac) or Alt (Windows) and Spacebar keys 
simultaneously to access the grabber hand, 
regardless of which tool you are using.
▶
 Use the forward delete key 
to delete words 
and spaces to the right of the cursor. If you are 
using a laptop, you will need to press FN+delete
to delete items to the right of the cursor.

Using Raised and Drop Caps
A well-set paragraph is a pleasure to view and to read. Skilled typesetters use 
subtle techniques to give text interest and visual appeal. Adding raised or drop 
caps (capital letters) is one of these techniques. Both raised and drop capital 
letters are larger than the accompanying body copy. A drop cap is a large letter 
(or several letters) that drops below the baseline. A drop cap is a paragraph 
attribute and is set by using the Paragraph Formatting Controls (a paragraph 
can have only one value for any given paragraph attribute, such as drop caps, 
space after, and alignment). A raised cap sits on the baseline and rises above 
the rest of the text. A raised cap is a character attribute and can be set in the 
Character Formatting Controls (a paragraph can contain characters that have 
many different character attributes, such as point size, font, and color).
The letter shape of some drop caps tends to separate the letter from the rest of the 
word. Extra kerning might be required in these cases. (We will discuss kerning in the 
next chapter.)
One word of caution—use raised and drop caps sparingly. They are generally 
used at the beginning of an article or chapter. However, as Visual 3–6 
demonstrates, if these special techniques are overused, the end result is a 
document that looks like type has been splattered all over the page.
Let’s return to the document you have been working 
on and add some drop and raised caps.
1. 
Make sure the text frame is active by double-clicking on the text. The cursor should now 
be an I-beam.
2. 
Highlight the first letter of the first word.
3. 
Making a raised cap: hold down Shift+Command (Mac) or Shift+Control (Windows)
and press the greater-than key (>) five or six times to increase the point size. The 
size of the letter will increase and the letter will remain sitting on the baseline.

4. 
Making a drop cap: put the cursor in the next paragraph. Switch to the Paragraph
Formatting Controls. Visual 3–7 shows the two fields you will be using, located right 
below the Space After field you used earlier. The field on the left controls how many 
lines the letter(s) will drop. The field on the right controls how many letters will be 
dropped. Experiment with these controls by clicking on the arrows and watching 
your screen. Change the first letter in that paragraph to an A and turn it into a drop 
cap. See how the shape of the letter separates it from the rest of the word? The space 
between the letter pair needs to be adjusted, a process called kerning, which will be 
discussed in the next chapter. Keep your document open to use in the next exercise.
Manage Hyphenation Settings in Your Document
Automatic hyphenation is active as an InDesign default. For some documents 
you will want to turn automatic hyphenation off. To do so, create your document 
and select the Type tool. Go to the right end of either the Paragraph or Character 
Formatting Controls panel, click on the icon shown in Visual 3–8 to reveal the 
options menu and then select Hyphenation. When the Hyphenation Settings 
dialog box opens, deselect Hyphenate at the top of the window. Automatic 
hyphenation is now turned off for this document. The Hyphenation Settings 
dialog box also allows you to decide whether capitalized words will be hyphenated 
and how hyphenation will affect individual words. (When hyphenation is turned 
off, you can still add a discretionary hyphen to individual words. Discretionary

hyphens will be discussed later in this chapter.) Even with automatic hyphenation 
turned off, InDesign permits you to override the document hyphenation 
setting and apply hyphenation to individual paragraphs. Place the cursor in the 
paragraph and check Hyphenate in the Paragraph Formatting Controls panel.
To turn off hyphenation in a single paragraph, place the text cursor in the paragraph 
and deselect the Hyphenate option n
 in the Paragraph Formatting Controls 
panel. It isn’t necessary to highlight the whole paragraph because hyphenation 
is a paragraph attribute, and formatting one line in a paragraph affects the entire 
paragraph. If you want to turn off hyphenation in several adjoining paragraphs, 
drag with your mouse to select the text. It isn’t necessary to highlight everything 
in each paragraph. One letter of the first or last paragraph will do. Now deselect 
the Hyphenate option in the Paragraph Formatting Controls panel. To manually 
turn off hyphenation on all the text, select all the type and deselect Hyphenate.
Use Nonbreaking Spaces and Hyphens to Keep Words Together
There are some words and phrases that should not be split from one line to another. 
Proper names with titles (Dr. Smith), telephone numbers (888-7707), dates 
(July 16, 1947), and some compound words (New York) should not be split from 
one line to the next. InDesign makes it easy to control these potential problems.
To keep compound words from splitting, insert a special nonbreaking space 
between the two words. Place the cursor between the words and delete the regular 
space. Open the Context menu and select Insert White Space. Then choose 
Nonbreaking Space from the menu of different types of spaces you can insert. If 
your hidden characters are turned on, you will see a new symbol that designates a 
nonbreaking space (^). To turn on hidden characters, press Command+Option+I

choose Insert Special Character>Hyphens and 
Dashes and then choose Nonbreaking Hyphen 
from the menu of available special characters.
Apply Alignment Settings
Another great feature in the Paragraph Formatting Controls panel is the Alignment 
option. Visual 3–10 illustrates the six alignment options that you will use most 
often. When text is aligned to the left, the right edges of the text are uneven, which 
is referred to as ragged right, or flush left. When text is pushed to the right side, 
the left edges are ragged. This alignment is called flush right or ragged left. Text 
that spreads all the way from the left to the right edges of the text frame is called 
justified. Text that is centered creates ragged edges on both sides. Each alignment 
setting has its design challenges. Ragged edges must not be too uneven or the 
page will have a choppy look. Justified type can be riddled with uneven white 
spaces within the lines that merge to create rivers. Examine your justified copy 
carefully to make sure rivers don’t disrupt eye flow and reduce readability.
Indent Copy
Indents push paragraphs a specified distance from the left or right sides of a text 
frame. Visual 3–11 shows the Paragraph Formatting Controls panel fields used to 
set the following types of indents: left, right, first line, and hanging. Don’t confuse 
paragraph indents with text frame insets. An indent is a paragraph formatting 
attribute that can apply to individual paragraphs within a text frame. An inset is a text 
frame attribute which affects all the text—every paragraph—within the text frame.

To create a paragraph indent, select your paragraph(s), place the cursor in the desired 
indent field in the Paragraph Formatting Controls panel, and type a numerical 
value or click one of the arrows. Very simple. Let’s discuss how to create two specific 
indents: a first line indent and a hanging indent. Place the cursor in a paragraph and 
then change the value in the First Line Left Indent field by clicking the upper arrow. 
You will see that only the first line indent increases and moves to the right. This is 
easy to visualize and understand. The hanging indent is a bit more confusing. Look 
at Visual 3–11 and you will see that most of the paragraph “hangs” from the first line 
of text. To set a hanging indent, you must first set a left indent. Once the left indent 
is set, you then change the First Line Left Indent field by entering a negative value. 
This forces the first line back to the left. Once you understand the sequence, creating 
a hanging indent style will also become easy to incorporate into your production.
Balance Ragged Lines
Ragged line endings create an open, 
friendly look. As you scan up and 
down the block of copy you want the 
overall shape and pattern of the line 
endings to look like smooth hills, 
not like rough, jagged mountains. 
InDesign has a wonderful feature 
for smoothing out ragged copy.

a paragraph in the document and make sure 
it is left justified. Locate and choose Balance 
Ragged Lines in the Paragraph Formatting 
Controls panel options (Visual 3–13). The 
edges of your paragraph should smooth out. 
To smooth out ragged edges on everything 
in your text frame, select all your paragraphs and apply the Balance Ragged Lines 
option. Balance Ragged Lines also affects paragraphs that are aligned to the right.
Use Quotation Marks and Prime Marks
As shown below in Visual 3–14, there is a difference between typewriter quotation 
marks and typographer’s quotation marks. Typewriter quotation marks really 
have little place in typesetting. Some typesetters use straight typewriter quotation 
marks to indicate measurements such as feet and inches. Straight quotation 
marks are found under the Type menu, or Context menu>Insert Special 
Character>Quotation Marks. While straight quotation marks are acceptable, 
a better way is to insert prime marks for dimensional units of measurement.
By default, InDesign uses typographer’s quotation marks, sometimes called curly 
or smart quotes. If someone has changed your InDesign defaults, you can easily 
change the preferences back to use typographer’s quotes. On the Mac, choose 
InDesign>Preferences>Type. In Windows, choose Edit>Preferences>Type. 
Make sure there is a check mark next to the Use Typographer’s Quotes 
option. If you enable this option setting when there is no document open, 
InDesign will use typographer’s quotation marks as the default setting for 
all subsequent documents. If you change this preference setting with a 
document open, the change will apply only to the current document.

Prime marks are found in many fonts, including the Symbol font, and 
are accessed through the Glyphs Panel. Choose Type>Glyphs. Select 
the Symbol font and show the Punctuation category in the Glyphs 
panel. Double-click to insert the appropriate mark in your text.
Before we move on to another topic, let’s put some quotation marks in our practice 
document. Select all the type by pressing Command+A (Mac) or Control+A
(Windows) and change the alignment to justified mode with the last line aligned 
left. Now put twelve sets of quotation marks at the beginning and end of the 
lines in your copy block. Scatter the quotation marks up and down the length 
of the copy block, and get ready for another great InDesign technique!
Hang Punctuation
You can’t help but be excited about InDesign. No other software can match its text-
handling capabilities. And the ability to offset punctuation is another great InDesign 
feature. Now that you know how to use the correct quotation marks, it’s time to 
fine-tune your copy. If you look closely at the quotation marks you inserted at the 
beginning and the end of your lines, you will see that the marks visually create tiny 
holes in the text block. At first glance this might not seem like a big deal. But after you 
use the next function, you will see what a huge difference a little fine-tuning makes!
1. 
Highlight your type. Locate the Font Size field in the Control 
panel and make a note of the point size of your text.
2. 
Go to the menu and choose Type>Story. The Story panel is used only for Optical 
Margin Alignment, a very powerful function! Optical margin alignment allows 
punctuation marks that appear at the beginning or end of lines of type to 
be extended slightly beyond the text frame. This prevents quotation marks 
from creating the look of tiny holes at the edges of a column of type.
3. 
As Visual 3–15 shows, there are only two fields on the Story panel. Click the box next to 
Optical Margin Alignment. A check mark should appear. The field in the lower area of the

Panel is called the Align Based On Size control. It is used for setting the point size of the 
type in the copy block. Since you just made note of the point size, enter that value in 
the Align Based On Size field. When optical margin alignment is active, notice how the 
quotation marks are partially set outside the edges of the text frame, creating a much 
smoother visual path for the eye to follow. Toggle the Optical Margin Alignment box a 
few times and see the difference it makes. Very cool. What a fantastic InDesign capability!
Using Hyphens and Dashes
Now that you have quotation marks squared away, it’s time to move on to hyphens 
and dashes. A hyphen is a dash entered by pressing the key to the right of the 
key for the number zero. Hyphens are used in only two instances: to separate 
compound words such as state-of-the-art (including compound names, such 
as Anderson-Jones and compound numbers, such as phone numbers) or to 
hyphenate words at the end of a line of type. A hyphen that is automatically 
added by InDesign during the text flow process is called a soft hyphen. This 
hyphen will disappear if the text is edited and the hyphen is no longer needed. 
When you deselected Hyphenate in the Paragraph Formatting Controls panel 
earlier in this lesson, you were turning off the soft automatic hyphens.
Hard hyphens are those you place in compound words when typing, or ones that 
you manually insert to hyphenate a word at the end of a line. Hard hyphens are 
there to stay—they are part of the text just like any other visible character. If the 
line endings change during the editing process and a manually hyphenated word 
ends up in the middle of a line, it will still be hyphenated. If there’s a chance that a 
manually hyphenated word might appear in the middle of a line after your text is 
edited, be sure to use a discretionary hyphen. Like a soft hyphen, when a discretionary 
hyphen is no longer needed, it will disappear. For instance, suppose you are 
working with auto hyphenation turned off and a four syllable word has wrapped 
to the next line, leaving a white “hole” at the right end of the preceding line. To 
even out the ragged edge, you decide to manually hyphenate the word. To insert a 
discretionary hyphen, place the cursor where you want the hyphen to appear. Open 
the Context menu, choose Insert Special Character>Dashes and Hyphens> and 
then choose Discretionary Hyphen from the menu of available special characters.
Dashes are different from hyphens, with different size dashes for different 
purposes. The first type of dash is an em dash. An em is a flexible unit of measure 
that corresponds to the point size of the type. For instance, an em in 5-point 
type would be 5-points wide, while an em in 10-point type would be 10-points 
wide. An em dash is used within a sentence—as in this sentence—to provide

a break in thought (a process called interpolation). In the days of typewriters, 
two hyphens were used to indicate an em dash. You can create an em dash by 
pressing Shift+Option+Hyphen (Mac) or Shift+Alt+Hyphen (Windows).
An en is half the size of an em; so an en dash is half the size of an em dash. An en 
dash is used to show a range of time, numbers, or a geographic area, and substitutes 
for the word to. When a poster reads that an event runs from September 26–30 in 
the Minneapolis–St. Paul area, en dashes are used to separate the dates and cities. 
An en dash is also sometimes used in headlines when an em dash looks too large. 
You can enter an en dash by pressing Option+Hyphen (Mac) or Alt+Hyphen
(Windows). You can also open the Context menu, while using the Type tool, 
to access em and en dashes from the Insert Special Characters menu. However, 
because this method is much slower, you should memorize the shortcut keys.
Calculate Paragraph Line Measure
There are many factors that work together 
to create good typesetting. There is an 
inseparable relationship between type 
size, measured in points, and line measure, 
indicated in picas. A line measure that is 
too long in relation to the point size will 
be difficult to read. For example, if a line 
measure is short and the point size is large, 
the copy will look choppy because too many 
hyphens will be needed. A good rule of thumb:

As the point size increases, the line measure should also increase. It is easy to 
calculate the range of acceptable line measure by multiplying the point size of 
the type by 2 or 2.5. The resulting number will be the line measure in picas. 
For instance: 10-point type × 2 = 20 picas. And 10-point type × 2.5 = 25 picas. 
Therefore, a line measure between 20 and 25 picas would be an excellent starting 
point. Readability is the overriding concern—a measure too long or too short 
reduces readability. Let’s see how easy it is to calculate line measure in inDesign.
1.	
Create a new 8.5" × 11" document, margins 0.5".
2.	
Draw a text frame of any size.
3.	
Fill with placeholder text by using the  menu options or by choosing 
Type>Fill with Placeholder Text. Select all the type and change the point size to 10 pt.
4.	
Switch to the Selection tool and on the Control panel highlight the Width field and 
type 20p (20 picas). If your unit of measurement is set to inches, InDesign will translate 
20 picas into 3.3333 inches as soon as you press the Return key. Print your document.
5.	
On your print, look at a line of average length. How many “words” 
appeared in it? The optimal number of words in a single line is nine or 
ten. How many characters (including spaces) were there? A good middle-
range character count would be between 40 and 66 characters.
6.	
Select your text frame with the Selection tool. In the Width field, increase the 
measure to 40p and print out the document. Compare the two text blocks, one 
with a 20p measure and the other 40p. Which one would you prefer to read?
Proofreader’s Marks
Someone sent me this tongue-in-cheek word play for people 
who use only the computer’s spell checking system to proof their 
documents: Weave know knead four proofing any moor.
It is essential to proof every project manually, in addition to using your computer’s 
spell check system. Sometimes clients will provide electronic copy, and other 
times you will type in the copy yourself. Whatever the case may be, all copy 
needs to be proofed. Knowing basic proofing marks will speed up the proofing 
process. Out in the workplace, where many people work on a single project, 
using these marks will give clear direction to others and be a precise method of

done with an extra-fine, fiber tip pen with a contrasting ink color, such as red or

where the problem is, and a corresponding mark, in the margin, describing the 
solution. Interpreting a standard set of proofreader’s marks is much easier than 
trying to decipher a hodgepodge collection of cross-outs, circles, and arrows.

Summary
A few years ago, after being inspired by watching “do it yourself” shows on cable 
TV, I purchased a fancy miter saw to use in finishing our basement. It was easy to 
plug in the saw and make cuts. However, getting the corners of the trim molding to 
fit perfectly was another matter. I soon found out that using the saw was the easy 
part—what I didn’t know were the techniques required for producing professional-
looking finish carpentry! This chapter moved you beyond merely “powering 
up” InDesign, to incorporating typesetting techniques that are standards in our 
profession. Some of my students don’t “buy in” to learning these techniques—and 
you can see the results in their poor typesetting. Remember, your potential employer 
only needs to examine your document formatting by making hidden characters 
visible to determine your InDesign proficiency. These first chapters are designed to 
help you develop excellent production habits which will last throughout your career. 
Although many of the rules and techniques seem nit picky at first, they will become 
automatic after practice.
Anatomy of type was introduced, followed by a discussion of hidden characters 
and paragraph definition. The features of the Paragraph Formatting Controls were 
emphasized in this chapter. You learned how to format paragraphs using space 
after, raised and drop caps, and various indents. Nonbreaking spaces and hyphens 
were introduced, as well as the proper use of quotation marks and dashes. These 
important production tips were presented:
▶
▶ Use soft returns (Shift + Return or Shift + Enter) to 
manually break lines within a paragraph.
▶
▶Use a hard return (Return or Enter) only at the end of a paragraph.
▶
▶Use space after (or space before) to add
extra space between paragraphs.
▶
▶Do not set text “line for line” unless absolutely necessary.
▶
▶The Story panel allows you to activate Optical Margin Alignment.
▶
▶Go to the www.identifont.com web site when you need to match a typeface.
▶
▶A formula for determining the range of acceptable line measure for 
body copy, is 2 to 2.5 times the type’s point size, in picas.
Now that you’re becoming comfortable with using type, in the next chapter we’ll 
throw images into the production mix.

Distinguishing Typefaces
When you look at the photos above you see a variety 
of colors, shapes and textures. These objects have 
two characteristics in common—they are all circular, 
and they are everyday objects. We are so familiar 
with thermostats, cleanser cans, and pie plates that 
it only takes a glance for us to identify each item. 
But if you showed these images to someone who was 
not immersed in our culture, that person would only 
recognize the common circular shape because there 
would be no context for a broader understanding.
Similarly, typefaces might simply look like a bunch 
of letters to you. When you first begin working 
with type, it’s difficult to see much variation 
between typefaces. For some, it’s even difficult to 
distinguish between a serif and sans serif typeface. 
As you continue to immerse yourself in the world of 
type, you will begin to understand the personality 
and design nuances of specific typefaces. Like the 
objects pictured above, typefaces will communicate 
specific meanings and you will use them with grace 
and power. Be patient as you become a “type geek.”

introduction
The first three chapters have focused on the basics of InDesign and typography. If you have 
been waiting for the chance to work with images—as designers love to do—this chapter is 
for you. First, we will master the coordinate system, place text, and fine-tune type. Then, near 
the end of the chapter you will be introduced to placing, scaling, and cropping images.
This chapter covers a lot of material. When you have completed it, you will be well on your way to 
mastering InDesign and ready to work on projects that are more enjoyable, creative, and challenging.
As you work through this chapter, it is an excellent idea to review sections of earlier chapters 
that you may have had difficulty with the first time through. Remember, the advanced skills we 
cover later in the book depend on the solid foundation you are building in these first chapters.

InDesign’s Measuring System
InDesign gives you numerous ways to manage the precise size and placement of text 
and graphics frames. Before we discuss size and placement issues, let’s learn about and 
experiment with InDesign’s measuring system. InDesign can measure in points, picas, 
inches, inches decimal, millimeters, centimeters, ciceros, agates, or pixels. InDesign 
will even let you make up your own unit of measure under the custom category!
Locate, Change, Lock, and Unlock the Zero Point
The zero point is the intersection of the zero markers on the horizontal and 
vertical rulers. All measurements are referenced from this point. The default 
location of the zero point is at the upper left corner of the page (not at the 
margin). However, there will be times when you will want to move the zero 
point to another location in your workspace. The next series of steps will 
show you just how easy InDesign makes it to relocate the zero point.
1. 
Create a new document of any size. Find the zero 
point for the rulers in your document in the upper left 
corner. Visual 4–1 shows what the zero point looks like.
2. 
 To move the zero point, click on the ruler origin 
point (the upper left corner of your document 
window where the rulers meet) and drag down 
into the middle of the page. When you release 
the mouse button, look at the new location of 
the zero point on your horizontal and vertical 
rulers. Go back to the ruler origin point and drag 
the zero point to a second location. Repeat this 
until you are comfortable with the process.
3. 
To reset the zero point to the upper left corner of 
your document, simply double-click the ruler origin 
point in the upper left corner (Visual 4–1).
4. 
Drag the zero point to approximately the middle of your 
document. Go back to the ruler origin point and open 
the Context menu and select Lock Zero Point (Visual 4–2). 
You will notice that the icon of the intersecting lines 
disappears and that it is now impossible to reset the zero 
point. Use the same method to unlock the zero point.

Change the Units of Measure for the Entire Document
You can set the unit of measurement you wish to use by choosing InDesign (Mac) or 
Edit (Windows)> Preferences>Units & Increments. In the Ruler Units section of the 
dialog box you can set the Horizontal and Vertical rulers independently of each other. 
When you change these ruler preferences with no document open (for example, from 
inches to picas), these settings become the default for all new documents.
Switch the Units of Measure During Production
When you are working in a document, you can quickly change units of 
measurement by using the Context menu. Press Control
(Mac) or right-click (Windows) on the ruler origin point, to 
display the Context menu. The unit of measure you choose 
will apply to both rulers. Or, you can apply a separate unit 
of measure for each ruler by using the Context menu on 
each of the rulers at the top and side of the page. If no rulers 
are showing, they have been hidden. Press Command+R (Mac) or Control+R
(Windows) to bring them back into view. Press Command+R (Mac) or Control+R
(Windows) to hide them, or select Hide Rulers from the Context menu.
The X and Y Coordinate System
Every document you create in InDesign is automatically divided into an invisible 
grid of horizontal and vertical coordinates. When you move horizontally across the 
screen, you are moving along the X coordinate axis. When you move vertically, you 
are moving up or down the Y coordinate axis. The zero point determines whether 
the values of the coordinates are positive or negative. As you move the cursor to the 
right of the zero point, the X coordinate is a positive number that increases. As you 
move left of the zero point, the X coordinate is a negative number that decreases. On 
the Y axis, moving down vertically from the zero point gives you positive numbers, 
and moving up from the zero point gives you negative numbers. If you had graphing 
in high school math, you may already be familiar with this type of coordinate 
system. However, as Visual 4–4 shows, in InDesign, the vertical axis is exactly the

opposite of what you are used to in algebra. Remember, in InDesign’s coordinate 
system the numbers on the Y axis are negative as you move up from the zero point.
The X and Y coordinates for all the objects in your document are displayed in the 
Control panel. The values in the X and Y fields are displayed in the measurement 
system that you have selected to work in. Because the document area (including 
the pasteboard) is invisibly mapped into a 
grid—like graph paper—it becomes easy 
to describe the location of each element on 
the page as being so many units from the 
horizontal or vertical zero point, expressed 
as either positive or negative (Visual 4–5). 
But how do you know which point on 
your object InDesign is measuring to? Is 
it the center of the object, the right or left edge, or one of the corners? This point 
is known as the reference point. Just as InDesign lets you move the zero point to 
suit your needs, you have the flexibility to set the reference point of an object to 
one of nine positions. It can be at any of the four corners; the middle of the top, 
bottom, right or left edges; or right in the center of the object. Let’s see exactly 
how the coordinate system and an object’s point of reference work together.
1. 
Create a 6" × 6" document. Make sure your units of measure are set to 
inches and your zero point is in the upper left corner of the document.
2. 
 Select the Rectangle tool (M) and draw anywhere in your document to create a 
rectangle. Notice the values of the X and Y coordinates in the Control panel.
3. 
Select your rectangle with the Selection tool (black arrow) and move it to the 
right. Watch the X coordinate increase as the rectangle moves to the right. 
Move it back to the left and watch the X coordinate decrease. Now move the 
rectangle up and down on the page. As it moves up the page, the Y coordinate 
decreases, and as you move it down the page the Y coordinate increases.
4. 
Now, look at the left end of the Control panel and you will see a series of nine 
small squares arranged in three rows and three columns (see Visual 4–5). One of 
these squares will be black and the rest will be white. This control is called the 
proxy. The proxy indicates the position of the reference point for the currently 
selected object. (The proxy is also found on the Transform panel that you can 
open by choosing Window>Object & Layout>Transform. Working with the proxy 
on either the Transform panel or the Control panel will give you the same results.) 
Look for the black square; it indicates where the reference point is located on your

The X and Y coordinates will change for each object 
when the reference point in the proxy is moved. In 
the two examples below, the objects have not been 
moved. Because the location of the reference point 
has moved in each example, the corresponding 
coordinates have also changed. Measuring begins 
from the reference point!
For most items the proxy is made up of nine squares. 
However, if the selected item is a straight line, the 
proxy will have only three squares active. These 
squares indicate the two ends and the middle point. If 
the selected item is a guideline, the proxy will show a 
horizontal or vertical line with only a center reference 
point. You cannot change the reference point of a 
guideline.
▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY

rectangle. Make sure your rectangle is still selected and click the center square in 
the proxy. The center square turns black, which means you have made the center 
of your selected rectangle the reference point. With the center black box on the 
proxy still selected, write down the X and Y coordinates of your rectangle.
5. 
Now click on the upper left square on the proxy and read the X and Y coordinates. Even 
though you have not moved your rectangle, your X and Y coordinates are different 
than the ones you wrote down a moment ago. This is because you have changed the 
reference point—it’s now the upper left corner of your rectangle, instead of the center.
6. 
Let’s place the rectangle in the exact center of your 6" × 6" document page. Make sure 
that your rectangle is selected, and click the center square on the proxy. Since your 
document is a six-inch square, three inches over from the side of the square and three 
inches down from the top would be the center of the page. Type 3 in both the X and Y 
coordinate fields and press Return. The rectangle should jump to the exact center of the 
page with the center point of the rectangle exactly at the center point of the page.
7. 
Select the rectangle and click the upper right reference point in the proxy. Type 6 in 
the X coordinate field and press Return. The rectangle should jump to align with the 
right edge of the page. Enter 0 in the Y coordinate field and press Return. The rectangle 
jumps to align with the top, right corner of the page.

You can now see the relationship between the reference point of an 
object and InDesign’s X and Y coordinate system. The intersection of 
the coordinates displayed in the Control panel always indicates the 
position of the reference point that you have selected in the proxy.
Understanding Paths and Selection Tools
A shape or line created in InDesign is called a path. A path can be a closed shape
such as a rectangle, or an open shape such as a line. The basic component of a path 
is a point. A path can have as little as two points—such as a line with beginning 
and ending points—or it can be complex, with numerous points. The straight 
or curved lines that connect the points are called segments. A simple rectangle is 
in reality a closed path made up of points and straight connecting segments.
InDesign has two tools specifically designed for 
working with paths. Let’s begin with the black arrow, 
the Selection tool (Visual 4–6). The Selection tool can 
be activated (when you are not using the Type tool) 
by pressing V. The Selection tool transforms a whole 
object—changing attributes such as size, scaling, 
position, skew, and rotation angle. It focuses on the 
outer dimensions and structure of an entire path. 
When you click on an open or closed path with the 
Selection tool, all the points on the path are selected. 
If the object has a fill, you can click on the fill to 
select all the points. With all the points selected, you 
can move the entire object. When you select another 
object with the tool, the previous object is deselected.
If you have several objects to select, you can select the first object and then add to 
the selection by pressing the Shift key while selecting the next object. Another way 
of selecting multiple paths with the Selection tool is to go to a blank space on the 
document and drag a rectangle (called a marquee) around the paths to select. Since 
the tool is designed to select whole paths, you can just touch the edge of each path 
with the marquee and the whole path will be selected.
The Direct Selection tool—the white arrow—is next 
to the Selection tool in the Toolbox (Visual 4–8). 
When you’re not using the Type tool you can press A 
to activate it. The Direct Selection tool is designed to 
select individual points or segments on a path. When

▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
The Selection tool moves and resizes entire objects. When you are 
in the Type tool you can temporarily access the Selection tool by 
pressing Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) or switch to the 
Selection tool by pressing ESC.
Use the Direct Selection tool to reshape objects. The Option (Mac) 
or ALT (Windows) keyboard modifier makes a copy of the selected 
object/line segment. You may move an entire object with the Direct 
Selection tool by selecting the center point of the object.

a point is selected, it changes from a hollow square to a filled square. When your 
Direct Selection cursor is over a line segment, a slash appears next to it. When it is 
over a point, a box appears next to it. Use the Selection tool to change the dimension 
of an object. Use the Direct Selection tool to change the shape of an object.
When you want to select all the points of a path using the Direct Selection 
tool, you can select the center point. You can also select all the points 
on a path by drawing a rectangular marquee, making sure all points are 
within the marquee’s rectangle. If the object has a fill, you can click on 
the fill with the Direct Selection tool and move the whole path.
Width and Height Coordinates
Delete the rectangle from your document. In the next series of steps you 
are going to draw an ellipse and then resize its shape using the selection 
tools and the W (width) and H (height) fields on the Control panel.
1. 
To draw an ellipse, click on the tiny triangle in the lower right corner of 
the Rectangle tool and choose the Ellipse tool. Click and drag an ellipse 
in your document. Deselect the ellipse you have just drawn by pressing 
Shift+Command+A (Mac) or Shift+Control+A (Windows).
2. 
Click the edge of your ellipse with the Direct Selection tool. Five hollow squares 
appear on the ellipse—one in the center, and one on each quadrant of the outer 
edge. These are called anchor points. Click on one and it will turn solid, allowing 
you to edit it independently of the other anchor points. You should also see 
lines extending from one or more anchor points. These lines are called direction 
lines. If you drag any of the anchor points or the end of a direction line, the 
shape will be changed (Visual 4–8). Experiment with moving the direction lines 
to change the shape and then undo your changes by pressing Command+Z 
(Mac) or Control+Z (Windows) until the shape is back to the original.

3. 
Deselect the object by clicking in a blank spot in your document or by using the 
keyboard shortcut Shift+Command+A (Mac) or Shift+Control+A (Windows).
4. 
With the Direction Selection tool, click first on the edge of the shape and 
then on the center anchor point. All the hollow anchor points become 
filled, which means they cannot be not editable. Drag the center square 
and move the ellipse to another part of the page. With the anchor points 
still selected, drag the edge of the shape and move it again.
5. 
Now switch to the Selection tool by pressing V. The ellipse will look much 
different. You will see the rectangular bounding box that shows the outer 
boundaries of the shape. On the bounding box you will see eight tiny squares 
and a ninth square in the middle of the ellipse. The center square will be filled, 
and the outer squares will be hollow. These boxes are called handles. Drag 
any of the handles to change the dimension of the ellipse (Visual 4–9).
6. 
There are several ways to move the entire ellipse: drag the center point, or 
click on and drag the edge of the ellipse, or click and drag a section of the 
bounding box. Use each of these methods and practice moving the ellipse. 
(Be careful not to drag a hollow handle, this will resize the object.)
7. 
Now, note the X and Y coordinates displayed in the Control panel. The coordinates 
indicate the location of the reference point of the ellipse designated in the 
proxy. Look at the W and H coordinates. These measurements show the width 
and height of the selected shape. As you drag on the handles on the bounding 
box of the ellipse, the dimensions in the Control panel will also change.
8. 
Type 4 in the W field and 3 in the H field. Press Return. Your ellipse should change size.
9. 
With the 4" × 3" ellipse selected, click on the center reference point on the 
proxy. Now type 3 in the X coordinate field and 3 in the Y coordinate field 
and press Return. The ellipse should now be centered on your page.

Working With Text
The copy in your document communicates a message while adding texture, color, 
shape, and contrast to your layout. Your ability to use text as a design element is an 
important skill to develop. In this next section you will learn how to create multiple 
column text frames and import (or Place) text from word processing documents.
Multi-column Text
Creating text columns within text frames is a simple process. When the 
Paragraph Formatting Controls are active, you can find the column options 
near the middle of the panel (Visual 4–10). The space between the columns is 
called a gutter (or alley). To change the width of the gutter, select the text frame 
and press Command+B (Mac) or Control+B (Windows) to open the Text 
Frame Options dialog box. In the Gutter field, enter the desired value for the 
gutter width. You can type the value in a unit of measure such as 1p (1 pica).
1. 
Draw a frame in your document. Select the Type tool and click the frame 
to instantly convert it to a text frame. Select the Paragraph Formatting 
Controls and change the number of columns to 3 (Visual 4–10). 
Change the gutter width to p6 (six points). Press Return.
2. 
Choose Type>Fill with Placeholder Text. Text will fill your text frame. 
With the Type tool active, select all the text using the shortcut key 
and reduce the point size until the last text column is empty.
3. 
Place the cursor in the middle of a line in the first column. Press Enter on the 
number keypad. This makes text jump to the next column. If you are in the habit of 
pressing the Return key over and over to force text to jump to another column—

don’t! Simply insert the cursor where you want the text to break and press Enter on 
the number keypad. If your keyboard doesn’t have a numeric keypad with an Enter 
key, open the Context menu and select Insert Break Character>Column Break.
Don’t get into the bad habit of pressing the Return key multiple times to 
force the text to flow to the next column. If your layout changes, you’ll need 
to delete all those manual keyboard entries. When you press the Enter key 
on the number keypad to insert a column break character, it will be much 
easier to simply remove it, if you have to revise the column break later.
Creating columns within text frames is simple and useful for projects. 
More often, however, designers will create separate text frames in different 
places on the page and flow the text between the frames. You will learn that 
technique, called threading, later in this chapter. Right now, you will learn 
how to use the Place command to bring text files created in a variety of 
word processors into your InDesign documents. What a timesaver!
Placing Text
The keyboard shortcut for placing text—Command+D (Mac) or 
Control+D (Windows)—is one you will want to memorize. You 
will use it again and again to import text or graphics. Pressing 
the keyboard shortcut brings up the Place dialog box.
Two important features of the Place dialog box are the choices to Show Import 
Options and Replace Selected Item, in the lower left corner (Visual 4–11). 
Show Import Options, among other things, gives you control over how different

versions of Microsoft Word text files are handled. Choosing Replace Selected 
Item will replace any text that is selected within a text frame with the contents 
of the file you are placing. If the frame is selected with the Selection or the 
Direct Selection tool, the entire contents of the text frame will be replaced.
There are three methods for importing text files: placing them into an 
existing frame, placing them into a new frame, and simply dropping the 
contents onto a page. In the next exercise, you will create a new 8.5" × 11" 
document, add a frame, and then use all three methods of placing text. 
You will be using a text file called 04 Copyfit.doc from the 04 Artwork and 
Resources folder in the CD accompanying this text. Find and load your CD.
Placing Text into an Existing Text Frame
In this exercise we will place text into a frame that you have already created.
1. 
Draw a 6" × 9" text frame. Set the reference point in the center at X coordinate: 4.25",
and Y coordinate: 5.5". Create 3 columns with a 1-pica gutter.
2. 
Insert the project CD, if you have not already done so. Press Command+D (Mac) or 
Control+D (Windows) to open the Place dialog box. Navigate to the project CD. Find 
the 04 Artwork and Resources folder and select the text file called 04 Copyfit.doc.
3. 
Uncheck Show Import Options and Replace Selected Item in 
the lower left corner of the dialog box. Press Return.
4. 
Move the cursor to the upper left corner of the text box. You 
will see tiny lines of type enclosed with long parentheses 
(Visual 4–13). This icon means your text cursor is loaded and 
ready to place text into an existing frame. Now click anywhere 
in the text frame and type will flow into all three columns. 
Notice the square with the red plus sign (+) in the lower right column. A red plus 
is the overset symbol—it means there is more text than the text frame will hold.

5. 
To delete the overset text, place the cursor at the end of the visible copy. If you 
are working on a Mac, select all the “invisible” overset text, beyond the plus sign, 
by pressing Shift+Command+End. Release those keys and then press Delete. 
If you are a Windows user, place your cursor at the end of the visible copy. Press 
Shift+Control+End to select the overset text. Release those keys and then press 
Delete. The plus sign should disappear as the text beyond the frame is deleted.
Place Text by Creating a New Frame
In this exercise, you will import text and create a new text frame to place it into, at the 
same time. First, delete the three-column text box, so that your document is blank.
1. 
Press Command+D (Mac) or Control+D (Windows) and 
select the 04 Copyfit. doc file again. Press Return. Move 
the loaded cursor over the blank document and look 
carefully at its shape. This time you will not see parentheses 
around the text cursor. Instead, you will see straight 
lines on the top and left edge. This icon indicates that a 
new frame will be created for the text (Visual 4–14).
2. 
Drag the loaded text cursor to create a frame. When you release 
the mouse, text will flow into the new text frame.
3. 
Change the Width and Height to 5" × 7" and create three columns. Again, notice the 
overset symbol in the out port in the lower right corner. Delete the overset text.
Place Text by Dropping Into the Page
This method of placing text drops the text into the document and lets it spread 
from margin guide to margin guide. Delete the text frame from your document.
1. 
Open the Place dialog box by using the keyboard shortcut and 
select 04 Copyfit.doc one more time. Press Return. Notice that the 
shape of the loaded cursor is the same as in Visual 4–14.
2. 
Click the cursor anywhere on the document. A text frame will stretch from 
margin to margin with the top positioned wherever you clicked on the page.
3. 
Delete the overset text.
▶ production tip
To delete overset text: 
Place the cursor at the 
end of the copy. Press

|  Chapter 4 |
Estimating Word Count
Look at the file you just placed and you will see that there are numbers scattered 
throughout the text. These numbers represent the word count. Now you can 
estimate how many words, in a specific font, type size, and leading, will fit in 
this text box. You can use the 04 Copyfit.doc file when you design the text areas 
for an InDesign project and then tell the copywriter how many words will 
be needed to fill the allotted space. Another way to estimate the word count 
for any passage of placeholder text is to highlight the copy and then open 
the Info panel. The character, word, line, and paragraph count is displayed at 
the bottom of the panel (Visual 4–15). Note: If this section of the Info panel 
is not visible, open the panel’s options menu and choose Show Options.
Managing Text Flow
Now that you have mastered the basics of placing text, it’s time to learn to manage the 
text flow as it is being placed into a document. You will learn these four techniques:
manual text flow, semi-automatic text flow, automatic text flow, and 
automatic text flow with a fixed number of pages. You will need to place 
the 04 Copyfit.doc file from your CD for the following exercises.
Manual Text Flow
When you use manual text flow, you make all the decisions regarding 
where placed text will be positioned and how it will flow. You have total 
control, but as the “manual” name implies, this method is the slowest.
1. 
Create a new document. Page size 7" × 5", landscape orientation. Enter 3 columns
with 1p gutter, 0.5" margins. Press Return.
2. 
Look closely at the column guides. Notice that there is no text frame on the page.
The column indicators are only guides—ready to hold a graphics or text frame.
Again, place the 04 Copyfit.doc file by using the keyboard shortcut. Move the cursor 
over to the upper left corner of the first column. The cursor shape indicates a new 
text frame will be created. Click in the upper left corner and the first column will 
fill with copy. You will see an overset symbol (+) at the bottom of the first column. 
The text will just “sit” there until you manually flow it to another column.

3. 
Press Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) to switch to the Selection 
tool. Click on the plus sign in the text out port. This process is called 
reloading the cursor. Your cursor has now changed into a loaded cursor, 
and you can see that the shape has changed (Visual 4–16).
4. 
Click in the upper left corner of the second column to flow text into this 
column. Reload your cursor by clicking on the text out port box. Click in 
the upper left corner of the third column and it will fill with copy.
5. 
Switch to the Type tool and place the cursor at the end of the text in the 
third column. Delete the overset text by pressing Shift+Command+End,
then Delete (Mac) or Shift+Control+End, then Delete (Windows).
Semi-automatic Text Flow
Flowing text manually from column to column is a neat technique, but 
imagine how tedious it would be if you had to do that for a 10-page 
document! InDesign is always one step ahead of the user—and has 
designed a second way to flow text called semi-automatic.
1. 
Select all the text frames in your document and 
then delete by using keyboard shortcuts. Place 
the 04 Copyfit.doc file once again. This time, hold 
down the Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) key 
as you hold the loaded cursor in the upper left 
corner of the first column. Notice the shape of the 
cursor changes into a snake pattern each time 
you press the Option or Alt key (Visual 4–17). Press 
this key a few times to get used to the difference 
between the cursors. This cursor means your text 
will be placed in semi-automatic text flow mode.

2. 
Hold down the Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) key and click in the upper left corner. The 
text will fill the first column and the cursor will remain loaded. Hold down the Option or 
Alt key and click in the second column. The text flows into the middle column. As long 
as you continue to hold the Option or Alt key as you click to drop text, you remain in 
semi-automatic flow mode and the remaining text will remain loaded in the text icon.

Continue in semi-automatic mode and fill the last column. Press ESC to 
get out of semi-automatic text flow mode. Delete the overset text.
Automatic Text Flow
Manual and semi-automatic text flow provide 
the most control for placing text in individual 
text frames on a single page, or a series of 
non-contiguous pages. Automatic text flow is 
another method of flowing text that is fast, and 
automatically inserts exactly the right number 
of pages required to hold the text passage.
1. 
Create a new file, 3" × 5" and 0.5" margins.
2. 
 Place the 04 Copyfit.doc file so that you have a loaded cursor. Hold down the Shift key as 
you move the cursor to the upper left corner of the page. Click inside the page margins.
3. 
Open the Pages panel by pressing Command+F12 (Mac) or F12 
(Windows) or by choosing Window>Pages. Notice that you now have more 
than one page in your document. When you place text in automatic flow 
mode, InDesign automatically adds as many pages as necessary.
Automatic Text Flow with Fixed Number of Pages
The automatic text flow option is great for many 
projects—but what if you must make the text fit 
on only four pages? The automatic text flow with 
fixed number of pages technique allows you to 
place text on a specified number of pages only.
1. 
Create a 3" × 5" document, 0.5"
margins, and 4 pages.

About Threaded Text Frames
In the exercises you just completed, text was flowing from one column to the next 
column. Text can also flow between individual text frames that are connected 
through a process called threading. As shown in Visual 4–20, each threaded text 
frame can have different text frame attributes including inset, fill, stroke and 
columns. Because threaded text frames are connected, you can use Command+A
(Mac) or Control+A (Windows) to select all the type in the threaded frames.

Seeing Links and Threads
This exercise will familiarize you with using threaded text frames.
1. 
Create a new document, 8.5" × 11", margins 0.5". Scatter three text 
frames on the document. Make some frames tall and some wide.
2. 
Place the 04 Copyfit.doc file. Drop the text into the first frame. You 
will see the overset symbol (+) in the lower right of your frame.
3. 
Choose either of the Selection tools and click on the overset text symbol. 
The cursor is reloaded and its icon changes. As you move the loaded text 
cursor over the second text frame, it changes to show two small chain links, 
indicating these two frames will soon be threaded together (Visual 4–21).
4. 
Click to place the text into the second text frame. Notice that the overset 
text symbol that was in the first text frame has now been replaced with 
a blue triangle. The blue triangle means this box is now an out port. The 
upper left side of the second text frame also has a blue triangle, an in 
port. Flow copy into the third frame using the same process.
5. 
Now from the Menu bar, choose View>Extras>Show Text Threads. When you select 
a text frame, you will see lines connecting the in and out ports on your frames. These 
show the direction and order of the text flow. A triangle in the out port means that 
the text is linked to another frame. A plus in the out port means that text is overset—
that there is too much text to fit in the frame. When the first in port and the last out 
port in a series of linked text frames are empty, it means that all the text has been 
placed (Visual 4–22). Don’t close your file—we’re going to use it for the next demo.

type basics
MANAGING UNDERLINES
During the days of old-fashioned typing, 
people used to underline text to add emphasis 
or to indicate the title of a book.
Unfortunately, that habit has carried over into 
the world of digital type, and most people simply 
click an icon to underline a word or sentence.
Today, italics are used to indicate the name of a 
book or to add emphasis. A heavier typeface can 
also be used to make a word or phrase stand out.
Typewriter-style underlines are rarely used 
in professional typesetting. If you must 
underline text, use InDesign’s Underline 
Options capabilities in the Control panel menu 
options to control the weight of the underline 
and to avoid cutting through descenders.

Unlinking Text Frames
There will be times when you flow text into the 
wrong frame. Of course, you can simply press the 
Undo shortcut, but that method is only practical if 
you catch your error shortly after it was made. Here’s 
another way to unlink threaded text frames.
1. 
Select the text frame in the middle of your text thread.
2. 
Double-click on the in port or the out port of the 
middle frame. If you double-click on the in port, the 
text flow will be cut off at the in port (A) and there 
will be a text overflow symbol in the first frame (B). 
If you double-click on the out port, text will be cut 
off at that point. The third frame is now empty and a 
text overflow symbol appears in the second frame.
When should frames be threaded?
Now that you know how to thread text frames, you’re 
probably wondering when you should use them. 
When text columns need to have individual attributes 
such as width, height, fill or stroke, you will want to 
use threaded frames. For instance, let’s say you are 
working on a newsletter, and you want to shorten 
the third column to accommodate a photo. If you are 
using a single text frame with three columns, this will 
be difficult because you can only shorten the entire 
text frame instead of single columns. When you use 
threaded text frames to create columns, you can shorten 
just the third frame, letting the text reflow. Generally, 
using threaded text frames provides more flexibility 
than using single frames with multiple columns.
The link has been broken and 
the overset symbol appears.

Underlining Words and Paragraph Rules
If you read the Type Basics on the previous page, you already know that underlining 
individual words is rarely done when setting type. Underlining is a throwback 
to the “typewriter days” when it was the only method of adding emphasis.
Underlining Words
For those rare times you need to underline text, you should not allow the 
rule to cut through a descender. Fortunately, InDesign has a complete and 
sophisticated way for you to adjust the weight and position of the underline. 
First, select the text you would like to underline. Then, select Underline 
Options from the options menu at the far right end of the Control panel. In 
the Underline Options dialog box (Visual 4–23), check the Underline On box 
and then adjust the weight, offset, color, and type of the line as desired.
Paragraph Rules
Paragraph rules may look like underlining, but they are an altogether different 
matter. Paragraph rules are design elements, and InDesign allows you to set 
rules in two places in each paragraph: 1) on or above the baseline of the first 
line of text; or 2) at the end of a paragraph. The Paragraph Rules function 
allows you to use color, styles, indents, and offsets to create just about any 
rule you’d ever want. Visual 4–24 shows some paragraph rules in action.
The Paragraph Rules dialog box can be accessed by using a keyboard shortcut: 
Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Alt+J (Windows), or by clicking 
on the options menu in the Control panel and choosing Paragraph Rules.

Applying a Rule Below a Paragraph
Whenever possible, apply rules as part of the paragraph formatting. 
A document that is filled with lines created with the Line tool is hard 
to edit because each line must be individually repositioned. Lines that 
are created as paragraph rules, will reflow as the copy changes.
1. 
Create a new document using the default settings. Draw a text frame and type your 
name on the first line and your phone number on the second line; use a hard return 
between the lines. Increase the type size to 48 points on 60-point leading.
2. 
With the blinking cursor somewhere in the first paragraph (the first 
line), press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Alt+J (Windows) 
to access the Paragraph Rules dialog box (Visual 4–25). You can also 
choose Paragraph Rules from the Control panel options menu.
3. 
Rule below means that a rule will be placed after a paragraph (created by a hard return). 
Select Rule Below from the list and check the Rule On option box. Select 8 pt in the 
Weight field menu, and Dotted in the Type field menu. The Width field should be set 
to Text. Enter 0.125" in the Offset field. When you increase the offset, you push the 
rule farther down, away from the baseline. Press Return and your type should look 
similar to the sample in Visual 4–25. Keep this document open for the next exercise.

|  Chapter 4 |
Applying a Rule Above a Paragraph
A rule above a paragraph will appear on the first baseline or will 
be offset above the first baseline of the paragraph. Applying a rule 
above a paragraph can be a little tricky because you’ll need to add 
an offset value so that the rule doesn’t cut through your type.
1. 
Click in the line that contains your name. First, you will turn off the rule 
below the paragraph. Open the Paragraph Rules dialog box and make sure 
that Rule Below is selected in the list, then uncheck the Rule On option. 
Click Preview and you will see the rule has disappeared. Press Return.
2. 
Now, you will add a rule above the phone number. Place the cursor in the line with 
your phone number. Open the Paragraph Rules dialog box and select Rule Above 
from the list. Be sure to check the Rule On option box. Select a line type and weight of 
your choice. Because the rule line will be drawn on the baseline, you’ll need to enter 
a value in the Offset field. Type p48 (48 points) to push the line up off the baseline.
How to Check Spelling in Your Document
It’s a good idea to always run a spell check before printing a document. But 
remember, even though InDesign’s spell check function is excellent, it doesn’t 
replace manual proofing. Both methods should be used to ensure accurate 
copy. To check spelling, simply press Command+I (Mac) or Control+I
(Windows). When the Check Spelling dialog box appears, you will need to 
make a choice in the Search list. The following list describes the options:
▶ The All Documents option checks the spelling 
of all open InDesign documents.
▶ The Document option checks the entire 
document you are working on. This is a great 
feature unless you have several pages of 
directory information including last names. If 
you would prefer to skip those sections of the 
document, choose the Story option.
▶Story option checks spelling in the selected 
text frame and all threaded text frames.
▶ The To End of Story option checks all the 
words beyond the blinking cursor.
▶ If you have text highlighted before opening the Check Spelling dialog box, then you 
have another choice. Selection checks the spelling of the highlighted text.
Once you have made a choice in the Search list, simply click Start to begin the 
process. InDesign will alert you of any questionable words and possible errors. 
When the checking is complete, click Done to dismiss the dialog box.

Understanding Tracking and Kerning
You already know what leading is. Leading is the vertical spacing 
between lines of type, measured from baseline to baseline. Tracking
adjusts horizontal spacing between all the characters on a line. A single 
paragraph can contain characters with many different tracking values.
Positive tracking increases spacing between characters; negative tracking
decreases spacing between characters (Visual 4–27). Tracking values 
are shown in the Paragraph and Character Formatting Controls.
Adjusting Text Spacing with Tracking
1. 
Create a new letter-sized document. Draw a text frame, type 
your full name and change the point size to 60-point.
2. 
To tighten the tracking of your text: Highlight text you want tracked, hold down 
Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows), and press the Left Arrow key near the number 
pad. At first the text will still be readable, but if you keep pressing the arrow key, 
notice that the text ultimately reverses itself. Be careful not to overdo tracking!
3. 
Delete the text box and draw a new one. Type your name in it again in 60-point
type. Select all the text. Press Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) and the Right Arrow
key to loosen the tracking. Keep pressing the right arrow key and you will see that 
it doesn’t take very long for your name to become just a series of individual letters. 
Again, be conservative with tracking. When misused, it inhibits readability.
You will occasionally use tracking to fine-tune your type. At times you may want 
to use negative tracking to give your text a little more refined look, especially 
with headline type. You will also use tracking to fit troublesome lines of type 
into the line measure. While InDesign has taken care of much of this for you 
with its multiline composition feature, there will be times when you will need 
to manually adjust tracking. For instance, at the end of a paragraph, you should 
avoid leaving part of a hyphenated word or any word shorter than four letters 
on its own line. As a typesetter, you need to make a decision: either tighten 
tracking slightly to make room for the word in the line above, or loosen tracking 
to bring the whole word or an additional word to the last line of a paragraph. 
VISUAL |4–27 |

in both the Character and 
Paragraph Controls panels.

|  Chapter 4 |
The goal is to alter the word spacing so slightly that no one will ever notice. You 
have gone too far with your tracking if the tracked text looks darker or lighter 
than the surrounding text. Tracking should be invisible to the untrained eye.
Adjust Character Spacing with Manual Kerning
Closely related to tracking is kerning. Kerning is the horizontal spacing between 
two characters only. You should kern letter pairs when spacing between characters 
is too wide or too narrow. For instance, look closely at the number 740 shown in 
Visual 4–28. Before you started reading this book, it would have looked perfectly 
fine. But with your professional eye, you now see that the spacing between 
the 7 and 4 looks much wider than the spacing between the 4 and the 0.
Kerning will correct this. Place your 
cursor in between the 7 and the 4. 
Do not highlight any text. The same 
keyboard shortcuts used for positive 
and negative tracking are also used 
for kerning; press Option+Left 
Arrow (Mac) or Alt+Left Arrow 
(Windows) to tighten the space between 
the numbers. The amount of adjustment is shown in the Kerning field in 
the Control panel. InDesign adjusts the kerning in units of one-thousandth 
of an em. (You will remember that an em is a unit of measure equivalent 
to the point size—an em space in 10-point type is 10 points wide.)
A more common place to kern letter pairs is when using drop and raised caps. 
Visual 4–29 shows what they look like without kerning. As shown above, 
some letter pairs usually need kerning. Your goal is to have the “color” of 
text look even. Big gaps between letter pairs make a word look airy.

Working With Images
The perfect image, combined with beautiful type, form a “one-two punch” that 
makes a document which is both memorable and effective. Most of the images 
you use will be either scanned, created in a vector-based drawing program 
such as Adobe Illustrator, or created in a pixel-based program such as Adobe 
Photoshop. As powerful as InDesign is, it is not a true drawing program. But 
you shouldn’t underestimate InDesign’s drawing capabilities. If you have already 
used Adobe Illustrator, you have seen tools and functions in InDesign that look 
very familiar. If you haven’t used Illustrator, you will learn about many basic 
drawing functions that are common to both programs, later in the book.
InDesign can place a variety of file formats including EPS, TIFF, and JPEG. A great 
feature is the ability to place InDesign documents and native Adobe Illustrator (AI) 
and Photoshop (PSD) files without conversion to a PDF, EPS or TIFF format.
Three methods of placing artwork will be discussed in this section: place and 
drop, place and drag, and place into a frame. The same keyboard shortcut is 
used to place text or images: Command+D (Mac) or Control+D (Windows). 
InDesign does not require a specific type of frame to hold a graphic and 
another to hold text. In fact, as you have already seen when placing text, 
you don’t need a frame at all! Let’s get started learning how to place images. 
You will need the CD that accompanies this book for these exercises.
AUTOMATIC OPTICAL KERNING
When professionals design a font, they build in rules for letter pair spacing. 
Unfortunately, the built-in kerning parameters don’t cover every letter pair 
scenario. That is why manual kerning is sometimes needed. But InDesign 
has gone one step further. It allows you to select Optical Kerning in the 
Kerning field on the Control panel. With Optical Kerning selected, InDesign 
goes beyond the built-in letter pair parameters and makes kerning decisions 
based on the shape of each character to even out how the type looks. This 
is a huge timesaver. InDesign does an excellent job of making text look 
great—with very little effort on the part of the person setting the type.

rotated, the degree of rotation is displayed 
next to the cursor and in the Control panel. 
When you release the mouse, the image 
will remain at its rotated position. To return 
it to its original location, enter 0 in the Rotation

dimensions are at 100%, the picture is full size. Often we need to use images at a 
size larger or smaller than their 100% actual size. It’s easy to do this in InDesign.
1. 
Use the Place command to place 04 Demo.tif. Again, notice the straight lines by 
the paintbrush in the thumbnail image, indicating that it will create a frame for the 
graphic. Drop in the upper left corner of your document. This is the image’s full size. 
Changing the size of an image is called scaling, and we’ll do that in the next step.
2. 
Place 04 Demo.tif again. This time, click and slowly 
drag the mouse. As you drag, look in the lower 
right corner next to the cursor and you will see X 
and Y percentages displayed (Visual 4–33). These 
percentages tell you the size the image will be 
when the mouse is released. Any number less than 
100% is a reduction in size, and any number larger 
than 100% is an enlargement. Release your mouse 
when the X and Y percentages are right around 
45%. When you release your mouse, notice that 
the percentages are no longer displayed. Once 
an image has been placed, you can find out its 
percentage of enlargement or reduction in the 
Control panel. Click the image with the Direct 
Selection tool and look in the Scale X and Scale Y 
Percentage fields of the Control panel (Visual 4–34) 
to see if your image is approximately 45%.
3. 
Place 04 Demo.tif once again. This time, drag to enlarge the image to 150%. After you 
release the mouse, select the image with the Direct Selection tool and look in the Scale X 
and Y Percentage fields on the Control panel to confirm that it is at 150% . If it isn’t, 
simply enter 150 in either field and press Return. Verify that the button that constrains 
proportions for scaling is turned on is gray (Visual 4–34), so both the X (horizontal) and 
Y (vertical) dimensions of the image will be at 150%. If it isn’t, click it to turn it on.
Before we move on, let’s summarize what you’ve just learned. Command+D 
(Mac) or Control+D (Windows) places an image. Once the cursor is loaded, 
you can either click to drop the image at its full size, or click and drag to

▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
resize, or scale, the image proportionately. After an image is in a layout, you 
can check the scale by selecting the image with the Direct Selection tool and 
looking at the Control panel. An image can be rotated by dragging the corner 
when the Rotation arrow is displayed. Those are the basics, and if you’re 
confident that you’ve mastered those skills, you’re ready to move on.
Place into a Frame, and Crop the Image
Remember that transparent doughnut that appears whenever you mouse over an 
image? That’s the Content Grabber, a new feature in InDesign CS5. Among other 
things, the Content Grabber helps you reposition images inside a frame. The process 
of showing only a portion of an image is called cropping. For instance, you might 
have a great photo of your significant other, taken when you were on a road trip. 
Unfortunately, above their head is the sign from the gas station where you made a pit 
stop! With InDesign, you simply adjust the image inside the frame so that the focal 
point is the adoring grin of your significant other. Most images are improved with 
strategic cropping and scaling. In the next exercise, you’ll use the Content grabber 
to separate the twins shown above, in the Moving Toward Mastery section. You will 
also learn how to proportionately scale an image inside the frame. Let’s get started.
Disproportional Scaling
The Y (vertical) dimension has 
been scaled to a greater percentage 
than the X (horizontal) dimension, 
making the photo tall and thin.
Proportional Scaling
Click here to 
scale vertical 
and horizontal 
dimensions 
uniformly.
Images have width and height dimensions, called 
X Scale and Y Scale Percentage. When the X (width) and 
Y (height)scale percentages are the same, the image 
is scaled proportionately. If you resize the photo so 
that the width dimension is at 50% and the height is at 
100%, the picture is the same height, but it is half its 
original width. This is disproportional scaling. If you
were using a picture of clouds as a background photo, 
the photo could be scaled disproportionately without any 
consequences. However, you want to keep most images—
products, people—proportional, meaning the width 
and height percentages will be the same. Always check 
these percentages by selecting the image with the Direct 
Selection tool and finding the percentage in the X and Y 
Scale Percentage fields of the Control panel.
PROPORTIONAL SCALING IS IMPORTANT!

Place into a Frame, and Crop the Image
1. 
Place 04 Crop.psd in the upper left corner of your document, using the “place 
and drop” method. We’ll use this as a reference photo at actual size, or 100%.
2. 
Select the Rectangle tool, click in the middle of your 
document, and enter 1 in the width and height fields 
to create a 1-inch square. Use the Place command 
to load 04 Crop.psd. When the picture has been 
placed, notice that only one of the twins, Julia, 
appears in the frame. The image is placed at full 
size, no matter what size the frame (Visual 4–34).
3. 
Select the image with the Selection tool and as you 
hover your mouse over the image, the transparent 
doughnut (the Content grabber) will appear. Click 
and pause on top of the doughnut and you will 
see the rest of the image that extends beyond the 
frame as semi-transparent, or ghosted. Click on the 
doughnut and slide to the left to crop out Julia, and 
bring the other twin, Sophia, into view. The Content 
grabber makes it easy to position the part of the 
photo that should be displayed in the frame.
4. 
Now let’s say you want Sophia’s image to be larger. 
If you pull on one of the photo’s frame handles, 
it simply makes the frame bigger, allowing more 
of the photo to be revealed. To make the photo 
resize proportionately and maintain its crop, check 
Auto-Fit on the Control panel. Select the photo 
with the Selection tool, and pull a corner frame 
handle to proportionately make the photo larger 
or smaller. For those of you who love keyboard 
shortcuts, you can also proportionately scale 
an image by selecting it with the Selection tool, 
press Shift+Command (Mac) or Shift+Control 
(Windows) and pull a corner frame handle.
5. 
You’ve learned how to crop and scale—how about moving the image to a 
different area of the layout? Simply click on the image with the Selection tool 
(not on the doughnut) and move the image (and frame) to a new location.
When Auto Fit is checked, the 
image will scale proportionately.
VISUAL |4–34 |
When you hover over an 
image with the Selection 
tool, a transparent doughnut, 
the Content grabber, is 
visible. Click and drag on the 
content indicator to move 
an image inside a frame.
VISUAL |4–35 |
When Auto-Fit is checked, 
you can easily scale images 
proportionately. You can also 
accomplish this by dragging the 
frame handle while using these 
keyboard shortcuts:
Shift+Cmd (Mac) or 
Shift+Ctrl (Win).

The Container (Frame) and the Content (Image)
When you are working with images, remember that you are managing two 
components: the frame (or container) that holds the image, and the image (or 
content). When working with images, you need to first decide if your action is 
affecting the container or the content. If you understand the difference between 
the Selection and Direct Selection tools, you will realize that you would use the 
Selection tool to resize the frame, and the Direct Selection tool to resize or move 
the content inside the frame. It’s easy to confuse image frame boundaries with the 
container frame guides! When this happens, frustration can occur. For instance, 
say you want to delete the image, but not the frame. If you have the container 
frame selected and press Delete, the frame and the image will be removed. Instead, 
you would need to select the content and not the container. The following short 
exercises will take you through the main image-handling techniques and will 
help you differentiate between when the container or the content should be 
selected. These exercises are quick and easy, and important techniques to learn.
A. Toggle between the container and the content
▶Double-click the image (not the doughnut) and watch as you switch 
between the container and the content. Your ability to toggle between 
container and content is the starting point for all the remaining exercises! 
As you toggle between the image and frame, notice that the guides are 
different colors—and the frame has a yellow box on the right edge.
B. Scale the image inside the frame without changing the frame size
 
▶Double-click to select the content frame. Press Cmd+Opt+> or < (Mac) or 
Ctrl+Alt+> or < (Win) to increase and decrease the scale in increments.
C. Rotate the image inside the frame
▶Double-click to select the content. Move the Selection tool to the lower right 
corner of the content’s frame, until until you see the curved arrow. Rotate the 
image inside the frame.
D. Center the image inside the frame.
 
▶Double-click to select the container. Pull the handles out until the frame is 
much larger than the image. Press Shift+Cmd+E (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+E (Win) 
to center the image.
E. Fill frame proportionately.
▶Use the image from Exercise D with the image centered in an oversized frame. 
Double-click until the content is selected. Press Shift+Cmd+Opt+E (Mac) or 
Shift+Ctrl+Alt+E (Win) to fill the container proportionately.
F. Fit the frame to the content.
 
▶Using the Selection tool, double-click a corner frame handle to fit the 
frame to the content. The entire frame is scaled to fit the image. Now, 
pull the frame handles to make it much larger than the image. This 
time,, double-click a frame handle on the middle of the frame’s sides, 
top, or bottom. The frame will resize, either horizontally or vertically.

These basic image handling exercises can also be accomplished using buttons 
on the Control panel. One beautiful feature of InDesign is that it allows you to 
work in the style you prefer. As you can tell by now, I encourage using keyboard 
shortcuts. The more you use them, the more you will remember them and the 
faster you’ll be at production. But some people prefer to choose options from 
the menu. If you’re one of those people, you will appreciate the convenience 
of using the Control panel for much of your text and graphics editing.
Scaling Disproportionately
A poster promoting a weight loss program, was hung in our college hallway, 
showing the “before” and “after” photos of a participant who had lost 20 pounds. 
Obviously, the “after” picture was created by simply resizing the first photo 
disproportionately, to make the person look thinner. Be careful when scaling 
images! Most of the time you will want to keep your image in the same proportion 
as it was originally created. But there will be instances, as in the cloud example 
mentioned earlier, when disproportional scaling will be acceptable.
1. 
Double click the image to select the content. Drag any content frame handle. The 
image will resize and become distorted. Check the Scale X and Y Percentage fields 
on the Control panel to see new horizontal and vertical percentages of the image.
2. 
Enter the same number in each of the fields and the image will again be proportional.
Summary
If this seemed like a long chapter, that’s because it was long! In these first four 
chapters you have learned so much. You now understand InDesign’s measurement 
system. You know how to create multi-column text frames, and to place and thread 
text. You used InDesign’s tracking and kerning, paragraph rules, and spell check 
functions to fine-tune your type. Finally, you learned how to place, scale, and crop 
images. With these techniques mastered, you’re ready to tackle more advanced 
projects. The Chapter 4 projects are designed to solidify these new techniques. 
Next, we’ll move on to another one of my favorite topics: tabs and tables.

introduction
If you’ve ever seen a good marching band in a parade, you know that they march in formation. 
A poor marching band wanders all over the place—trumpets out of line, clarinets out of 
step, drums missing the beat. Nobody knows whom to follow or what comes next.
This chapter will help you keep your text in formation. In earlier chapters you have learned how 
to format text in sentences and paragraphs. In this chapter you will work with text designed 
for use in charts, order forms, and business reports—projects that need tabs and tables to 
keep information in line. Honing your skills with tabs and tables will keep your text marching 
in formation, and prove to your boss or your client, that you are a master at what you do!
There are four methods people typically use to align text and numbers in columns:
☹ Press the spacebar repeatedly until the text lines up.
☹ Press the Tab key over and over until the text lines up.
☺ Create precise tab settings.
☺ Create tables to hold the information.
No matter which method you have used in the past, I guarantee that after 
this chapter you will never use either of the first two methods again!

Working With Tabs
Whether you are working on a car, hanging wallpaper, or building a deck, it is 
always great to get tips from pros—especially at the beginning of the project! Here 
are some great tips for tabs. Following them will make setting tabs so much easier.
▶Mark up the copy (a fine-tip pen with colored ink works the best). 
Your markup will show where you will press the Tab key and the location 
and type of each tab stop that will be set. This step is critical in the 
beginning stages of typesetting. Pre-planning a job in this way can 
prevent time-consuming errors (see the sample markup in Visual 5–2).
▶ Press Command+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Alt+I
(Windows) to show each tab character and make it easy to 
find those places where you accidentally pressed the Tab key 
twice. Or, select Hidden Characters from the View Options 
menu on the Application Frame, above the Control Panel.
▶Do the typing first, pressing the Tab key only one 
time between columns of information. Your text 
probably won’t line up at first because the cursor jumps to InDesign’s 
preset tab settings of every half inch. Later, when you set the desired 
tab stops, the copy will line up at the correct new location.
▶ Work with copy left-aligned—doing so makes setting tabs much easier.
▶ Open the Tabs panel: Shift+Command+T (Mac) or Shift+Control+T (Windows).
▶ Press the Tab key only once! Your copy will look great after you set the tab 
stops. Don’t try to align copy by pressing the Tab key repeatedly.
Marking up Copy–An Important Production Step!
The first tab tip is to mark up the copy to show each time you press 
the Tab key and where the tab stops should be placed. Before you can 
mark up the copy, you must know what kind of tab is needed. We will 
start with three simple kinds of tabs: Left, Right, and Center. 
Each of these tab stops looks different on the Tabs panel. Study Visual 5–1 until you 
can identify the shape of each tab stop and visualize how it will align the copy.

Just as stretching prepares your muscles 
for a workout, marking up tabular 
copy prepares your brain and creates 
a visual connection between you and 
the software, forcing your brain to 
shift into “tabs mode.” It’s tempting to 
skip this step, but until you are totally 
confident, you should take the 30 
seconds to mark up your copy. In the 
mark up process, you indicate each 
time you press the Tab key and where 
each tab stop should be set. Visual 5–2 
shows copy that has been marked up 
correctly. This markup becomes a road 
map that will make setting tabs a snap.
Setting Tabs
You will need the CD that accompanies 
this book to work on the following 
tabs exercises. The good news is that 
all the typing is already done for you—
you will concentrate on using the 
Tabs panel for formatting your copy. 
Open 05 Tabs Demo.indd, found in the 
05 Artwork and Resources folder on 
the CD. Find Exercise 1 on the 05 Tabs 
Demo document. The first step in 
setting tabs is understanding how the Tabs panel works. Open the Tabs panel using 
Shift+Command+T (Mac) or Shift+Control+T (Windows). You can also access 
the Tabs panel by going to the Type menu and choosing Tabs, but this is a slower 
method. Study Visual 5–3 to learn the fields and panel options for the Tabs panel.

Exercise 1A – Snapping the Tabs Panel to the Text Frame
Activate the text frame in Exercise 1 with the Selection tool. With the Tabs panel 
open, notice the magnet on the far right end. This is the control that will position 
the Tabs panel directly over the active text frame, if possible. To see it in action, 
change your view size to 100% and click on the magnet. The Tabs panel will align 
itself to the top of the text frame. Switch your view to 200%. Click the magnet—
it will resize and snap to the top of your text frame. Now, switch your view to 
1200% from the magnification field in the upper left corner of your screen. Click 
the magnet, and it won’t move. This seemingly inconsistent behavior occurs 
because when you are viewing your document at high magnification levels, there 
is not enough room above the active text frame to position and resize the Tabs 
panel. So, the snap above text frame function is disabled. Change the view size 
back to 100% and click the magnet to snap the Tabs panel to your text frame. 
You can set tabs without having the panel snapped to the frame, but it is easier 
to see what you’re doing when the ruler is snapped above your text frame.
Look carefully at the text frame, noticing that an inset has been applied to all 
four sides. When the Tabs panel is snapped to the text frame, the measuring 
does not necessarily begin at the edge of the frame. Instead, it begins where 
the text begins. In this case, the zero point of the tabs ruler snaps to the 
text frame inset setting. The tabs ruler lines up to the inset guide.
Exercise 1B – Adding and Removing Tab Stops
Deselect the text frame in Exercise 1. We’re going to experiment with the 
Tabs panel. Adding tab stops is an easy process. Simply click in the narrow 
white area directly above the ruler. Slide your cursor down the ruler a bit and 
click again. Each time you click, a tab stop is added. When a tab stop is first 
added it is blue, which means it is active. Once you make a new tab stop, the 
previous one is deselected. To delete a tab stop, select it and pull it above the 
Tabs panel ruler. When you have many tab stops to delete, it is faster to go to 
the Tabs panel options and select Clear All (Visual 5–4). Clear all your tabs.
Place a tab stop near the middle of the ruler. Press Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) 
and click repeatedly on the tab stop. As you click, watch as the tab stop alignment 
settings change from left, to center, to right, to decimal. Use this method to cycle 
through tab stop alignment settings whenever you are setting tabular copy.

Exercise 1C – Setting Left Tabs
Use the Selection tool to select the frame in Exercise 1. Look closely at the 
invisibles to identify each time the Tab key was pressed (Visual 5–5). Each time 
the Tab key was pressed, the copy was pushed to the nearest tab preset. Since 
Dr. Ryan Johnson’s name was shorter than the other names in the first column, 
Dr. Theodore Soos moved to a tab preset closer to the left edge of the copy block. 
Usually, copy will not align until you actually set the tab stops. Resist the temptation 
to “fix” the copy by pressing the tab key repeatedly to manually align copy!
Be sure the Tabs panel is open and snapped to the top of your text frame. 
You should still have the Selection tool activated. Drop in Left tab stops at 
approximately 0.25" and 2". As you place each stop, click and hold, and a 
vertical line will appear to show where your copy will be aligned. You can 
also see the measurement of the tab stop in the X box. Adjust the position of 
your copy by sliding the tab stop to the right or to the left on the ruler.
Notice that all the lines of copy moved as you placed the tab stops. When 
you select the text frame with either the Selection or Direct Selection tools, 
and do not highlight the text lines, the same tab settings are applied to all 
the tabular copy inside the text frame. When lines of copy in a single frame 
require different tab settings, individual lines must be separated with a 
Return (not a soft return) and highlighted before setting the tab stops.

Exercise 2 – Setting Center and Right Tabs
Now let’s move on to Exercise 2. A completed sample of this exercise is shown 
in Visual 5– 7. Before you begin this exercise, use Visual 5–7 for markup. 
Place a horizontal arrow → in the text to indicate each time the Tab key is 
pressed. Examine the copy closely to determine the required tab stops. Indicate 
the appropriate tab stop above each column, using these symbols for Left, 
Center, or Right 
. A tab stop won’t be required in every line.
When your markup is completed, open 
the Tabs panel. Find the lines of type 
with identical tab settings, and work on 
those as a unit. Then move to the next 
series of similar tab settings. Refer to your 
markup as you drop in your tab stops. 
Press Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) and 
click on each tab stop to cycle through 
the alignment options. If you need to 
adjust the position of a tab stop, highlight 
the copy and move the stop to the left 
or right on the Tabs panel ruler. Your 
completed project should look almost 
identical to the example in Visual 5–7.
Exercise 3 –
Setting Decimal Tabs
When you set a Decimal tab stop, the 
copy is lined up according to the position 
of the decimal. In Visual 5–8, notice 
how the numbers one through ten are 
aligned by their decimal points. In the 
right column, the numbers also align 
according to the decimal point. If there is 
no decimal point, such as in the answer 
for #7, the whole number is positioned to 
the left of where a decimal point would 
be placed. Mark up the copy, making 
sure to indicate a tab before numbers 
1 to 10. Then, create the tab settings.

Exercise 4 – Aligning To Special Characters
The Decimal tab default aligns copy according to the location of the decimal 
point, but you can specify other characters on which to align the decimal tab. In 
this exercise, the copy will be aligned to the dollar sign. First, select the Decimal 
tab. Then, enter a dollar sign ($) in the Align On box in the Tabs panel.
Exercise 5 – Setting Right Indent Tabs
Right indent tabs automatically push your copy flush with 
the right edge of the text frame. Right indent tabs aren’t 
part of the regular Tabs panel. Press Shift+Tab or use the 
Context menu>Insert Special Character>Other>Right 
Indent Tab to create a right indent tab. Display hidden characters to verify that 
an automatic right indent tab has been inserted. Follow the directions included 
with Exercise 5, on page 2 of 05 Tabs Demo.indd, to create right indent tabs.

Exercise 6 – Using Indent to Here
Indent to Here is one of those “can’t live without it” features in InDesign. Although 
technically this is not a tab setting, this is a good time to introduce this function. 
With Indent to Here, you insert a special character symbol by pressing Command+\ 
(Mac) or Control+\ (Windows). Starting with the next line, all subsequent lines 
in the paragraph align to the position of the Indent to Here character. This is 
similar to creating a hanging indent. Once you press the Return key for a new 
paragraph, paragraph text will revert back out to the left margin. To remove the 
Indent to Here character, simply turn on the hidden characters, find the Indent 
to Here dagger symbol, place the cursor to the right of the symbol, and press 
the Delete key. When you use the Indent to Here keyboard shortcut to complete 
this exercise, be sure to use the Back Slash, not the Forward Slash key!
Exercise 7 – Setting Repeat Tabs
When you need tabs to be spaced at equal intervals, you can use the 
Repeat Tabs function found on the option menu at the far right end of the 
Tabs panel. In this function, equally spaced tab stops, based on the position 
of the first tab stop, are spread across the line. Directions for creating 
Repeat tabs are included with Exercise 7 in 05 Tabs Demo.indd.
Exercise 8 – Creating Dot Leaders
A leader is a series of repeating characters between a tab stop and the following 
text or the end of the text frame. Leaders can be dots, lines, or any other character 
you choose. You can specify up to eight characters in the Leader box on the Tabs 
panel. You will most often use leaders 
in conjunction with Right tab stops. To 
create the dot leaders in this exercise, 
set a Right tab at the right end of the tab 
ruler. Making sure the Right tab stop is 
selected, enter a period and space in the 
Leader box and press Return. The area 
between the first and second columns 
will fill with dots. As Visual 5–12 shows, 
if you don’t enter a space along with the period, the dot leaders will be too close. Add 
dot leader tabs to the text in Exercise 8, so that it looks like Visual 5–13. This exercise 
demonstrates how dot leaders help the eye move from one column to the next.

Exercise 9 – Creating Line Leaders
Throughout your professional career, 
you will likely create many projects that 
are “variations on the theme” of the raffle 
ticket presented in Exercise 9. When 
creating line leaders, place an underline 
in the Leader box by pressing Shift+ 
hyphen, found at the top right corner of 
your keyboard. If you don’t press the Shift 
key, the space will be filled with dashes, 
not underlines. Sometimes, when you 
are creating line leaders, the underlines 
on your monitor will appear to have 
spaces between them. If this happens, 
increase your view magnification and see 
if the rules look solid at a different view 
percentage. Sometimes it’s just a “screen thing.” Other times, this happens because 
you actually typed a space and an underline in the Leader box, on the Tabs panel.
Visual 5–15 shows the tab settings for the last line of the raffle ticket. The 
line leaders are applied to the two Right tab stops. If the line after State runs 
into Zip, it probably means you have added a line leader to the left Tab stop at 
the word, Zip. If so, select the stop and delete the line in the Leader box.

When working with tabs, remember these tips:
▶  Mark up the copy. Show where the Tab key will 
be pressed, and where the tab stop will be set.
▶  Work with hidden characters visible. Press 
Command+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Alt+I 
(Windows) to show hidden characters. 
This will show each tab character and will 
make it easy to find those times when you 
accidentally pressed the Tab key twice.
▶  Do the typing first, pressing the Tab key only 
one time between columns of information.
▶  Work with copy left-aligned when possible—
doing so makes setting tabs much easier.
▶  Press Shift+Command+T (Mac) or Shift+Control+T 
(Windows) to open the Tabs panel.
▶  Press the Tab key only once! Be patient—your 
copy will look great after you set the tab stops.
▶  Highlight the Leader box by clicking on 
the name to the left of the box.
▶  With a tab stop highlighted in the Tab ruler, 
press Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) and 
click on the tab marker to cycle through 
the tab stop alignment settings.
▶  Add a space after the period in the Leader 
field when creating dot leaders.

Last Thoughts on Tabs
The columns within text frames, that you created in earlier chapters, are used for 
continuous text passages. They are designed to have the copy fill across and down the 
first column, then flow into the second column, and so on. Set tabs when the copy 
flow is horizontal. The tab stops will create the appearance of vertical columns.
Don’t confuse tabs with paragraph indents and text frame insets! Sometimes you will 
use a left indent instead of a tab. That method works perfectly. However, be careful 
of creating a left inset in Text Frame Options rather than a left indent because the 
inset will affect all the text in the frame—which may not be what you want! The 
hidden characters shown below reveal the techniques used in each example.

Creating Tables
Like tabs, tables also organize information 
into columns. Tables are different than 
tabs, however, because they are made up of rows, columns, and cells. With 
tables, you can add interest by changing the background color and text 
attributes of individual cells, columns, and rows. When thinking of tables, 
people often picture a clunky-looking graph with copy choked against heavy 
black lines. Not so, with InDesign. In this second half of Chapter 5, you 
will discover the amazing and enjoyable ways you can create tables.
There are several ways you can create tables: from “scratch,” by converting 
existing copy, or by importing from a Microsoft® Word document or Excel 
spreadsheet. You can insert a table into a text frame or convert existing text 
into a table. The best way to understand tables is to make them, so we’re going 
to dive right in. In the following exercises, you will learn all the basics of table 
management using a simple table consisting of four rows and four columns.
Table Basics
1. 
Insert a table. Create a letter-size InDesign 
document with 0.5" margins. Draw a text 
frame from margin to margin. Select the 
Type tool and click in the frame. Press 
Shift+Option+Command+T (Mac) or 
Shift+Alt+Control+T (Windows) to bring up the Insert Table dialog box. You 
can also access this dialog box by choosing Table>Insert Table. Specify 4 in the 
Body Rows and 4 in the Columns boxes. (Rows run horizontally, and columns run 
vertically.) Leave the Header Rows and Footer Rows fields blank. Press Return. A 
table now sits inside your text frame, aligned with the top of your text frame.
2. 
Position a table in the text frame. The new table has a cursor blinking in the 
upper left cell. With the Type tool selected, click anywhere in the text frame, 
outside of the table. Now the text cursor is positioned just outside the table on 
the right side of the text frame. Notice that the cursor is the same height as the 
table. Open Text Frame Options, Command+B (Mac) or Control+B (Windows), 
and under Vertical Justification choose Align: Center. Turn on the Preview option 
and watch the table jump to the vertical center of the text frame. Now, see what 
happens when you select the Align: Bottom option. A table behaves like a huge 
piece of type inside a text frame, and will be affected by alignment, indents, 
insets, space before and space after. Align the table to the top once again.

3. 
Select columns, rows, cells, or the entire table. Move the Type tool slightly 
above the table, over the left column. You will see the cursor change into an 
arrow (Visual 5–18A). Click, and the entire column will be selected. Place your 
cursor along the left side of the table, beside the first row (Visual 5–18B). Click, 
and the entire row will be selected. Now, bring the cursor to the upper left 
corner of the table. You will see a diagonal arrow (Visual 5–18C). Click, and the 
entire table will be selected. Place the cursor inside a cell and drag to the right 
to select it. You can continue to drag across a cell’s boundary to select adjacent 
cells. Practice selecting the entire table, individual rows, columns and cells.
4. 
 Select a cell or its contents. Place the cursor in the 
upper left cell and type your name. Move the cursor 
to highlight your name and the space surrounding 
it so that the entire cell is black. You now have the 
cell selected (Visual 5–19). Now, try to highlight just 
your name. Sometimes this is a little trickier, and 
it helps if you are at a magnified view. When your 
type is selected, the highlighting should just cover 
the letters, and your cell should look like the lower 
example in Visual 5–19. It is important that you can 
differentiate between selecting a cell or highlighting 
text inside a cell. You can also press the ESC key to 
switch between selecting the cell or the type in a cell.
5. 
Resize rows and columns. Place the cursor over the row guide below your name. 
The cursor now changes into a double-headed arrow (Visual 5–20). Pull the line 
down to create a much deeper cell. Repeat this process with the column guides. 
Notice how changing the size of rows and columns, changes the table size, too.
6. 
Resize rows and columns without resizing the table. Place the cursor over 
the row guide below your name. When the cursor changes into a double-
headed arrow, hold down Shift as you adjust the row dimension. Notice 
that the row inside the table changes size, but the table does not. Repeat 
this process, pressing the Shift key as you move the column guides.

7. 
Position text inside the cell. Highlight 
the cell that contains your name. Use the 
Paragraph Formatting options in the Control 
panel to align your type to the right. Now 
align the type to the center. You use the 
Table Formatting Options in the Control 
panel to set the vertical position and rotation 
of type inside the cell. In Visual 5–21 the 
type has been rotated 270°. With the cell 
selected, experiment with alignment and 
text rotation controls in the Control panel.
8. 
 Resize the entire table. Move the cursor to the lower right corner until 
you see a diagonal double-headed arrow. Press Shift and pull on the 
arrow and your table will enlarge proportionately. If you want to expand 
only the vertical or horizontal dimension of the table, move the cursor to 
either the bottom or the right side and pull to resize. Press the Shift key to 
proportionately resize the vertical or horizontal dimension of the table.
9. 
Add and delete rows and columns. You can add and delete rows and columns in the 
Table Formatting options in the Control panel or by using the Context menu. When 
using the Control panel, change the number of rows and columns in the appropriate 
box (Visual 5–21). You can also delete rows and columns using keyboard shortcuts. 
Highlight the bottom row. Press Command+Delete (Mac) or Control+Backspace 
(Windows) and the row will disappear. Delete a column by highlighting it and 
pressing Shift+Delete. Now, open the Context menu and examine the options. The 
Context menu holds almost all of the table editing operations you will use. Choose 
Insert>Row or Column. Specify the number and location of the new rows or columns.
10. 
 Merge and split cells. 
Highlight the first row in 
your table. Open the Context 
menu and select Merge 
Cells. One large cell now spans the 
length of your table. With this long cell 
highlighted, choose Split Cell Horizontally 
from the Context menu. Then choose 
Split Cell Vertically. You can continue 
splitting cells until they are quite small (Visual 5–22). Cells can also be merged and 
unmerged at the Control panel. Highlight the cells and click the Merge Cells button.

stop close to the middle of the column (Visual 5–24). Inserting a tab in a 
table cell is tricky. On the Mac you need to press Option+Tab instead of just 
Tab. In Windows, you must use the Context menu and choose Insert Special 
Character>Other>Tab. Line by line, place the cursor before the letter grade and 
insert a tab character to line up the grades close to the middle of the column.
6. 
 Place the text cursor in any table cell and open the Table Options dialog box. 
Use Shift+Command+Option+B (Mac) or Shift+Control+Alt+B (Windows). 
Select the Fills page and under Alternating Pattern, select Every Other Row, 
Color: Black, Tint: 20%. Set Skip First to 1. Press Return. The first row of the 
table should now be white, with every other row a 20% black tint.
7. 
Select the entire table and open the Cell Options dialog using the keyboard 
shortcut, Command+Option+B (Mac) or Control+Alt+B (Windows). Select 
the Strokes and Fills page. Under Cell Stroke, enter 3 pt. in the Weight field and 
[Paper] in the Color field. Press Return and deselect the table to see the results.
8. 
Finally, add a border around the outer 
edge of the table. Place the text cursor 
in any table cell and open the Table 
Options dialog box. On the Table Setup
page set the Table Border options as 
follows: Color: Black, Type: Dashed (any 
style), Weight: 2 pt., Gap Color: None.
Do not check Preserve Local Formatting. 
Press Return. Compare your table with 
Visual 5–25, adjusting point sizes as 
needed. Your table is now completed.

THE GRADE SCALE EXERCISE
DEMONSTRATED THESE TABLE FEATURES:
▶  Text can be converted to a table. Whenever there is a tab in the text, it will 
begin a new column; wherever there is a return, it will begin a new row. The 
text must be highlighted before the Convert to Table option will show up.
▶  You can add tab settings in table cells. To set the actual tab, you must 
press Option+Tab (Mac) or use the Insert Special Character from the 
Context menu (Windows) instead of simply pressing the Tab key.
▶  You can automatically create alternately shaded rows under Table Options.
▶  You can have the interior row and column lines one style and color, 
and choose a different style and color for the outer table border.
▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
Create a Table from Text You’ve Prepared
Now you will make a chart using many of the same techniques as the Grade Scale 
table, but you will prepare the text yourself. Visual 5–26 shows a table featuring 
the most popular baby names in 2008. Compare Visual 5–26 with the Grade Scale 
table and you will see many of the same features—with a few twists, of course.
1. 
Draw a text frame 20 picas wide by 22 picas deep. 
(Type p after the number in the W and H fields to 
indicate picas.) Type the copy as seen in Visual 5–26. 
Press Tab to jump from column to column and press 
the Return key at the end of each line. Do not set tab 
stops! Select all the text. Choose Table>Convert Text 
to Table. Keep the default settings and press Return.
2. 
Merge the cells in the first row to fit the title on 
one line. Move the row divider line down so that 
the title has more room. Highlight the cell and 
use the Table Formatting Controls to horizontally 
and vertically align the type to the center.

3. 
Highlight the table name, and make the type bold-italic and larger. The typeface 
used in Visual 5–26 is Chapparal Pro. Highlight the column titles and make the type 
bold, larger, and centered. Highlight the numbers in the Rank column. Change 
them to a larger, bolder typeface and center them horizontally in the cell.
4. 
Highlight the two columns of names and select a typeface and point size you prefer. 
Center the names horizontally in their cells. Press the Shift key as you resize the 
width of the Rank column so that it is narrower than the two Names columns.
5. 
Highlight both Names columns. Open the Context menu and choose Distribute 
Columns Evenly. Merge the cells in the bottom row to fit the source information 
on one line. Apply Red and Blue fills to the names as shown in Visual 5–26.
6. 
Open the Table Options dialog box. On the Fills page set Alternating 
Pattern to Every Other Row. Set the First Row Color to Yellow and Tint to 
20%. Press Return. Every other row in the table should be tinted. Select 
the entire table and open the Cell Options dialog box. Select the Strokes 
and Fills page and set Weight to 4 pt., Color to [Paper]. Press Return.
7. 
The table is almost done. This time, instead of adding a border to the table itself, you 
will center the table horizontally and vertically in the text frame and add the border 
to the text frame. Switch to the Selection tool and make the text frame slightly larger 
than the table by dragging the lower right corner frame handle, diagonally. Use the 
Stroke options on the Control panel to add a Blue, 4-point Japanese dots stroke.
8. 
Switch back to the Type tool. Click in the upper left corner of the text frame to place the 
cursor before the table. Center the table horizontally by pressing Shift+Command+C 
(Mac) or Shift+Control+C (Windows). Use Command+B (Mac) or Control+B 
(Windows) to open the Text Frame Options dialog box. Set the Vertical Justification 
Align: Center, and press Return. Congratulations! You’ve completed this table project.
Adding Headers and Footers to Tables
Often, tables begin with a row of information that is repeated on the top of each 
table. This information might include names, SKU numbers, classifications, 
categories, and so on. In the example in Visual 5–27, the days of the week are 
repeated at the top of each month’s calendar. This row of information is called 
a header. Rows that are repeated on the bottom of each table are called footers. 
InDesign allows you to create table headers and footers, and then specify 
where and how often you want them to appear on your table. This will be a

quick exercise—the table is already completed. You will use this sample table 
to experiment with adding a header. Designing one header and then having 
InDesign automatically apply it, is an efficient way of working. Any change you 
make to the original header applies to the table headers, in linked frames.
1. 
Open 05 Header Demo.indd from the 05 Artwork and Resources CD
accompanying this textbook. Notice that the table is partially completed. 
A row has been created that displays the days of the week. This would be 
a typical workflow. You’d design the table and a row that would be used as 
a header—but it isn’t a real header until it is converted to a header.

2. 
Highlight the row containing the days of the week. Open the Context 
menu and select Convert to Header Rows (Visual 5–28). This row is no 
longer body copy—it is a header. If you decide to make future changes to 
it, you need only to make those changes in this original header row.
3. 
If you look at the lower table which 
inside a linked text frame, you will 
see that the days of the week header 
automatically appeared. Now, 
open Table Options and choose 
Headers and Footers. Under the 
Repeat Header drop down menu 
(Visual 5–29), you can specify if the 
header should be repeated every 
text column (if the text frame has more than one column), once per frame, or 
once per page. Select Once per Page and you will see the header on the lower 
table disappear. Switch to Once per Frame and you will see the header again.
4. 
Open Table Options again. We created our 
header by converting an existing row to a 
header. But notice that you can also create 
headers in the Table Dimensions area of 
the Table Setup panel. Enter 1 In the Footer 
Rows field and choose Every Text Column 
from the Repeat Footer field. Notice that 
another row—a footer row— appears 
at the bottom of each month. If you try 
to highlight the bottom row you will see a lock icon (Visual 5–30) because you 
need to edit the footer at the original table, in this case, in the October table.

Header and Footer rows can also be converted 
to regular rows. Highlight the header or 
footer, open the Context menu and select 
Convert to Body Rows (Visual 5–31).
6. 
Select the table and open Table Options again.

Summary
You’ve come a long way! In these first five chapters of Exploring Adobe 
InDesign CS5, you’ve mastered an incredible array of techniques. 
This chapter focused on creating various tab settings and leaders. Indent to Here 
was introduced, giving you a quick method of creating a hanging indent. You learned 
how to build a table and create a table from existing text. InDesign’s table formatting 
options were used to enhance your table’s design. These production techniques will 
be used frequently in your design projects.
As you move ahead, the chapters will begin to be shorter, and the projects will be 
fewer, but more complex. This is a good time to page through the earlier chapters to 
review topics that might have been confusing the first time through—now they will 
probably make more sense. Keep studying your keyboard shortcuts!

introduction
Most homes have a junk drawer. Often found in the kitchen, this drawer holds a myriad 
of “nuts and bolts” that keep the household going. A peek inside the drawer reveals 
things like bottle openers, matches, pencils, paper clips, pliers, coins, twist ties, and 
bits of this and that—stuff that you need, but don’t exactly have a place for.
This chapter is a little like a junk drawer, because it’s full of miscellaneous 
techniques. But unlike the junk drawer in your kitchen, this chapter is loaded 
with many essential productivity tools, some of which are new in InDesign CS5. 
They didn’t fit into a nice category, so they got a chapter of their own.
By now, you have learned the basics, and armed yourself with a variety of skills. This 
chapter will focus on increasing productivity with techniques that will bring precision to 
your documents and efficiency to the way you work. Once you’ve used each important 
gadget in this chapter you’ll feel right at home using Adobe InDesign CS5.

Back to the Basics
Since you are now an old hand at creating basic documents, it is time to introduce 
a few more options available in the New Document dialog box. First, let’s 
review a few points for setting options in the New Document dialog box.
▶ Press the Tab key to jump from field to field in any dialog box.
▶  Turn on the Facing Pages option box when you want to create 
spreads. This will allow you to view documents with left and right 
hand pages like a book or magazine, two pages at a time.
▶  Use the Page Size list to select from a variety of preset dimensions, 
including Compact Disc and common monitor resolution sizes. 
“Letter” is the standard 8.5"× 11" printed page size.
▶  Click the Make all settings the same icon
p g
 to apply 
the same margin value to all fields (Visual 6–1).
▶  Highlight fields by clicking on the field name. This is faster than 
the click+drag method many people use to highlight fields.
Create Document Presets
In the Getting Started section in Chapter 1, you changed the default document 
specifications and customized InDesign to match your work style. InDesign 
also allows you to create presets for other document parameters you will most 
often use. Suppose that many of the documents you create are 5 × 7 inches. 
You can create a 5 × 7 document, set the margins and other page options, and 
then before clicking OK, select Save Preset. A dialog box will pop up asking 
you to name the preset, so it can be stored for future use (Visual 6–2). The next 
time you need to create a 5 × 7 document, you can choose this preset from 
the Document Preset drop-down list, in the New Document dialog box.

Your mind is probably spinning just thinking of all the document presets you 
could use—business cards, envelopes, letterhead, forms, flyers, brochures—
dozens of presets at your fingertips. So let’s go one step further. Imagine that 
a client often requires you to design ads for 15 different magazines. Each 
publication has different specifications that must be followed precisely. Spending 
15 minutes creating document presets for each publication is well worth the 
time. It will reduce the chance of error, especially when you are in a time 
crunch. Here is another method of making document presets. Use this method 
when you need to create many presets, or to delete or change existing ones.
1. 
 Go to File>Document Presets>Define. The Document Presets dialog box will open 
(Visual 6–3).
2. 
Click New, and the New Document Preset dialog box opens. Name the preset,
set the page size, margins and other options, and click OK or press Return.
3. 
Click New again and create a few 
more document presets so that you 
are comfortable with the process.
4. 
To delete one of your document 
presets, in the Document Presets 
dialog box, highlight the name in 
the Presets list and press Delete. You 
can’t delete the Default preset.
5. 
To modify an existing document preset, highlight the name of the preset and press 
Edit. Set the parameters that you want to change and click OK or press Return.

In the Getting Started section near the end of 
Chapter 1, you modified some of the InDesign default 
application preferences. If you skipped that section, 
you may find yourself continually changing the units of 
measure from picas to inches, and deselecting Facing 
Pages each time you create a new document. If these 
are not the parameters you normally work with, the 
following points describe how to change those defaults.
▶  When InDesign is launched but no document is 
open, you can change the units of measure to affect 
all subsequent documents. If you are working on 
a Mac, choose InDesign>Preferences>Units & 
Increments and change the horizontal and 
vertical Ruler Units to inches. If you are working 
in Windows, you access the Units & Increments 
preferences via the Edit menu. While you are 
in Units & Increments, you may also want to 
change the Size/Leading and Baseline Shift fields 
to 1 point rather than the 2-point default.
▶  To change the option settings for the default 
document setup, press Command+Option+P 
(Mac) or Control+Alt+P (Windows). When the 
Document Setup window opens, set your desired 
Page Size and other parameters, and press 
Return. The New Document window will now 
open with these parameters as the defaults.
▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
Getting to Know Bleeds and Slugs
Let’s dig a little deeper into the New Document dialog box. Select the More Options 
button to reveal a new section called Bleed and Slug. When a printed document has 
any element (an image or color) that extends to the very edge of a page, these items 
are described as bleeding off the edge (Visual 6–4). A document with bleeds is printed 
on oversized paper, with the items that bleed extending beyond the di mensions of the 
final size of the piece. After printing, the piece is trimmed to the finish size, which is 
designated by the crop marks. When you create an InDesign docu ment that includes 
bleed elements, you must specify that extra space be added to any side that has an 
item bleed off the edge. The standard bleed measurement is 0.125" (⅛   inch). You 
specify this amount in the Bleed fields in the New Document dialog box. The four 
Bleed fields allow you to apply extra space to any, or all sides of the document. Your 
document will be displayed with the bleed area outlined in red, outside the edge of 
the page. Make sure that any elements you want to bleed extend to this red border.
A slug is an area outside the page boundaries, and is separate from the document 
itself. Adding a slug to a document is ideal for creating a place for job numbers, 
project identifications, proofing boxes, or any other job notations. Let’s say you’re 
working in an advertising agency, and every project goes through a series of

proofings. In this case, a slug that contains the required creative team approvals, 
similar to the one shown in Visual 6–5, could be included in all your InDesign files. 
Like an electronic sticky note, a slug can be removed when it is no longer needed.
Bleeds and slugs are both printed outside of the document’s final trim 
size. In the Print dialog box you can choose whether or not to print the 
slug by checking the Include Slug Area box (Visual 6–6). In the next

Creating a Document with Bleeds and a Slug
Like bleeds, slugs are usually specified when a document is created. 
However, anytime during your production you can add a bleed or a slug to 
your document by choosing File>Document Setup>More Options.
1. 
Open the New Document dialog box and create a new document, 
5" × 7". Use your document preset if you made one earlier.
2. 
Select More Options. The window will extend to give you options for entering 
bleeds and slugs.
3. 
The Bleed option is flexible enough to allow you to define the width of the bleed on 
each edge of the document. If you need all four edges to bleed, click the Link icon 
before setting the bleed measurement to enter it in all four fields. For this exercise, add 
the standard bleed size of 0.125" (⁄ inch) on the top and right side of the document.
4. 
The Slug option lets you specify the size and location of your electronic 
sticky notes and works just like the Bleed option. Set up a 0.5" 
slug at the bottom of the document. Press OK or Return.
Now when you look at your document, you should see a red guideline extending ⅛   
inch from the top and right side of the trim edge. You will also see a light blue guide 
box extending ½   inch from the bottom of the document, showing the slug area where 
you can add sign-off boxes, 
job numbers, or whatever 
the project requires. 
Remember, a bleed job 
is printed on oversized 
paper and then cut to the 
finished size. Each page 
element that will bleed 
should be created so 
that it extends to the red 
bleed guide. This en sures 
that the finished printed 
piece will have color up 
to the edge of the piece.

Guides and Columns
Now that you are familiar with X and Y coordinates, it’s time to add working with 
guides to your document building skills. Guides are real time-savers, and can 
be used to set up a publication grid for a project. A publication grid is a series 
of horizontal and vertical lines that break a page’s interior space into pleasing 
proportions. Using a grid strengthens alignment and helps bring unity to a project.
Adding and Deleting
Page Guides
The easiest way to place a guide onto a 
document page is to click on the vertical or 
horizontal ruler and pull the guide to the 
desired location. Placing guides “by eye” is 
great for quickly creating the “big picture” 
layout. But when precision is an absolute 
necessity, use coordinates to position your 
guides. Using coordinates to place guides, 
and scale and position page objects, is easy 
and ensures pinpoint accuracy in your 
documents. The X or Y coordinate fields 
on the Control panel will show you exactly where the guide is placed, and allow 
you to change the position of the guide (Visual 6–7). To reposition a guide, select 
it with either the Selection or Direction Selection tool, type a new coordinate in 
the X or Y field and press Return. To delete a guide, click on it and press Delete.
Changing Margin Guides Page by Page
It’s easy to change margin guides for individual pages within a multi-
page document. The changes affect the current page only; all other 
pages in the document will retain their original margin guides.
1. 
Create a new Letter-size document. Margins: 1". Number of Pages: 2.
Press Command+F12 (Mac) or F12 (Windows) to open the Pages panel. You 
can also open the Pages panel by going to Window>Pages. When the panel 
opens, you will see a page icon with “1” below it. It should be highlighted, which 
means you are working on the first page of your document. Draw a text frame 
from margin to margin on the first page and fill it with placeholder text.
2. 
Choose Layout>Margins and Columns. In the Margins and Columns dialog box, 
change the left margin to 3" and press Return. The left margin will change, but 
your text frame does not. Some of your text is now in the left margin area.
VISUAL |6–7 |
The exact horizontal or 
vertical position of each 
guide is displayed in the 
X or Y coordinate field.

3. 
In InDesign, copy that is outside the margin still prints. Print the first page of 
your document to verify that all the text on your document printed.
4. 
In the Pages panel, double-click on the page icon with the “2” below it.
Notice that the margins on page 2 are still at 1 inch. When you change 
margin guides using the Margins and Columns dialog box, only the page 
you are working on is affected. We will learn how to change margin guides 
for the entire document in Chapter 9, where we cover Master Pages.
Document Columns and Text Frame Columns
Columns can be created either at the document level (where they apply to the 
whole page) or in a text frame (where they apply just to that frame). Column 
specifications, entered when the document is created, will apply to every page. 
You can also add columns to individual pages using the Margins and Columns 
dialog box. Document column guides are movable—you can select and drag 
them to the left or right with your mouse. Columns in a text frame are created 
using the Control panel, or by choosing Object>Text Frame Options. Unlike 
page column guides, column guides in a text frame are not moveable.
1. 
Create a new Letter-size document. Columns: 3.
2. 
Choose View>Grids & Guides and uncheck Lock Column Guides. Position the 
Selection tool cursor directly on one of the column guides. Press and hold the 
mouse button. A small double-ended arrow will appear. Slide the column guides 
to the left or to the right. Repeat this procedure with the other column guides.
3. 
Draw a text frame and use the Control panel to divide it into two columns. 
Click on the frame’s column guides and try to move them back and forth. 
They won’t budge. Text frame column guides are not moveable.
Using Grids and Guides in Production
When you receive a newsletter from your insurance company, local school 
district, or regional hospital, what do you do with it? Throw it away? Glance 
through it and then throw it out? Or…do you actually read it? As a designer, 
your objective is to have your newsletters read! Before you toss out the next 
newsletter you receive, take a few minutes to look for techniques the designer 
has used to enhance interest and readability. Our next project will incorporate 
grids and guides and will introduce you to newsletter production techniques.

▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
about newsletters
Internal newsletters are created for a narrowly 
defined audience of people already connected with 
the organization, such as company employees or 
school district parents. Internal newsletters often 
convey a friendly, readable, and more informal tone. 
Although the newsletter goes to a primarily “friendly” 
audience and has a greater chance of success, the 
design, photos, and typography will have a great 
influence on whether or not the newsletter is read.
 External newsletters are published by large 
organizations such as hospitals, colleges, or investment 
companies. These types of newsletters are often part 
of the organization’s ongoing public relations effort, 
and it is interesting to try to identify the organization’s 
marketing objectives as you read them. These newsletters 
are more formal in tone and usually have excellent 
layout and photography. Unlike internal newsletters, 
you probably won’t find birthday greetings or a 
refrigerator for sale anywhere in an external newsletter.
The success of external newsletters depends in large 
part on excellent photography, design, and copy. 
These newsletters are going to audiences where a 
larger percentage of readers are disinterested or even 
hostile. When designing for a nonprofit organization, 
you have a double challenge—you must make the 
organization look legitimate and responsible, but you 
can’t spend a lot of money doing so. This is a chance 
to let your design and typographic skills shine!
 Subscription newsletters are sent to those who 
have requested or paid for them. This audience is already 
“on your side.” Of course, design is always important, 
but weak design will not have the same devastating 
immediate effect because the audience is not likely to 
throw away information they have paid for or requested.
▶  The number of pages in a newsletter is usually 
divisible by four. The cover is counted as page 1.
▶  Pages of a typical 8.5" x 11" newsletter are 
printed side by side on a 17" x 11" sheet 
(unless there’s a bleed, in which case they 
are printed on oversized sheets).
▶  After printing both sides, the document is 
folded in half to create 4 pages (or collated 
together to make 8, 12, or 16 pages—
whatever the length of your newsletter).
▶  When you create a newsletter, you should select 
Facing Pages in the New Document dialog box. 
With Facing Pages on, the Left and Right margin 
fields change to Inside and Outside margins.

Building a Sample Newsletter
Picture yourself working in the marketing department of a busy building supply 
company. You are designing the first page of a new monthly newsletter to be 
presented to the marketing team. Visual 6–8 shows the finished product. You can 
find the necessary artwork in the Chapter 06 Artwork and Resources folder on 
the CD that accompanies this book. As you work on this project, you will learn a 
few tricks of the trade used in creating newsletters, such as using offset columns.
1. 
Open 06 Newsletter Template. Offset the columns by moving the first set of column 
guides (Visual 6–9). Go to View>Grids & Guides and uncheck Lock Column Guides. Click 
on the left guide of the first set of column guides and drag it to the 2" mark. Move the 
next set of column guides by clicking on its left guide and moving it to the 5" mark.
2. 
Place the nameplate. Find 06 Nameplate in the 06 Artwork and Resources folder. 
Place the file and adjust the position of the artwork. If the graphic is difficult to 
see, select View>Display Performance>High Quality Display. The baseline of the 
words Builders’ Update should sit on the top margin guide (Visual 6–10).
3. 
Add the publication information, which includes the volume, issue, and date
(Visual 6–10). Draw a text frame that spans the width of the first column.
Type the following on three separate lines with a Return after each: Volume 10, Issue 3, 
and March 2010. Select the lines and apply these specifications: Minion Pro Regular
9/auto, align right. Use the Text Frame Options dialog box to set the Vertical 
Justification’s Align field to Bottom and carefully align the baseline of March 2010
with the baseline of Trends and Market Analysis for the Professional Contractor, 
the tagline, found under the newsletter’s title. A tagline provides a key to the 
newsletter’s content or purpose, and is found on most newsletters (Visual 6–10).

Skilled designers incorporate devices that encourage people to read. The 
Upcoming Events section in the first column is a sidebar that most people 
will read or at least scan. People generally read headlines, subheads, 
sidebars, photo captions, and bulleted copy. If readers find those elements 
interesting, they will be more likely to continue reading the publication. 
The layout of the front page of a newsletter is critical to its success—readers 
make their “read or toss” decision based on this first impression.
4. 
Build the sidebar. Move your reference point in the Control panel proxy to the 
upper left corner. Draw a text frame in the first column. The Y coordinate: 2.0417". 
Set a 0.0625" inset on all sides of the frame. Open the Swatches panel (F5) and select 
the Yellow swatch. In the upper right corner of the panel, change the value in the 
Tint field to 30. (Remember to click the Fill icon.) Fill the frame with placeholder text 
(Type>Fill with Placeholder Text). Highlight 
the placeholder text and specify: Myriad 
Pro Light 8/12. Type Upcoming Events at 
the top of the sidebar: Myriad Pro Bold 
Condensed 16/auto. Type the name of 
each month: Myriad Pro Bold Condensed 
12/12. Create paragraphs similar to those 
shown in Visual 6–11. Add bullets (Option+8
or Alt+8) and use Indent to Here to create 
hanging indents under the bullets. Add 
0.0625" S/B (space before) to the paragraph 
containing each month’s name.
5.  Add the feature article. Draw a text frame 
in the middle column (Y: 2.0) and fill with 
placeholder text. Specifications: Minion 
Pro 10/12. Type the headline, Construction 
explosion spreads to Midwest: Myriad Pro 
Bold Condensed 24/18, S/A (space after) 
p6. Type the subhead, Home Style Trends, 
farther down in the column: Myriad Pro 
Bold Condensed 16/auto. Add a 0.125"
first line indent on all paragraphs except 
those that are preceded by a headline or 
subhead (Visual 6–12). (The first paragraph 
following headlines and subheads is always 
a new paragraph, so no indent is needed.)

Using a Baseline Grid
A good rule of thumb is to line up the baselines of text in adjacent columns whenever 
possible. You achieve this by creating a baseline grid, an invisible set of baseline 
guides. Once the grid has been created, you can lock the text to those guides. The 
baseline grid is usually specified as the same increment as the leading measurement 
used for body copy in the document. Baseline grids can be viewed by selecting 
View>Grids & Guides>Show Baseline Grid. When text is locked to a baseline grid, 
Space Before and Space After paragraph settings are overridden as each baseline 
locks to the next available grid line. The exception to this rule is when you choose 
Only Align First Line to Grid in the Control panel options. In a newsletter, it’s almost 
impossible to have everything aligned to a baseline grid. Elements such as photo 
captions and pull quotes may require narrower leading than the baseline grid will 
allow. In those instances, it’s a good idea to apply Only Align First Line to Grid.
6. 
Create a baseline grid. If you are on a Mac, choose InDesign>Preferences>Grids and 
type 1.375" in the Start field, and 1p in the Increment Every field. Press Return. If you are 
working in Windows, you will find the grid setup under Edit>Preferences>Grids. Choose 
View>Grids & Guides>Show Baseline Grid and your document will have horizontal 
guidelines from the top to the bottom in 12-point increments, similar to Visual 6–13.
7. 
Align to baseline grid. In Visual 6–13, the 
baselines of text in the two first columns do 
not line up with the grid, or each other. To 
align text to the baseline grid, highlight all 
the text in the main article and select Align to 
baseline grid from the Paragraph Formatting 
Options panel (Visual 6–14). Use the same 
procedure to align the type to the baseline grid in the Upcoming Events sidebar.
8. 
Place the photos. Draw a rectangular frame the width of the third column, 
height 1.9931", with a 0.5-pt. Black stroke. Position the top of the frame two grid 
lines from the newsletter tagline with the right edge flush with the right margin. 
Duplicate the frame by selecting it and pressing Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows).

to be created. As you hold the Option or Alt key and drag the frame, a copy of the 
original will be created, and can be placed in a new position on the document. 
Release the mouse and Option or Alt key. Use the Option or Alt+drag process to 
create two more frames. Space the two lower frames five grid lines apart. From the 
accompanying CD, place 06 House A in the top frame, 06 House B in the middle frame, 
and 06 House C in the third frame. Scale and crop the photos as shown in Visual 6–15.
9. 
Add photo captions. Draw text frames 
under the photos and fill with placeholder 
text. Specify Minion Pro Italic, 8/9. In the 
case of these captions, 8-pt. type shouldn’t 
be aligned to a 12-pt. baseline grid—the 
leading is too wide (Visual 6–16). Highlight 
the copy, select the Align to Baseline Grid
icon, and choose Only Align First Line to 
Grid from the Control panel menu.

Using Grids to Align Elements
In the last project you experienced firsthand how a baseline grid can be useful for 
aligning type. Creating grids that are made up of both horizontal and vertical lines 
brings an additional level of order to your documents. Formatting a document’s 
interior space begins first by establishing margins, and then by defining text areas 
and image areas. Grids are very 
helpful in this process. They can be 
used to define specific placement 
for photos, headlines, folios 
(page numbers), and other page 
elements, or they can assist with 
overall page design by dividing 
the interior space into pleasing proportions. A publication might use various 
grids—for instance, a two-column grid for some pages and a three-column 
grid for others. The newsletter completed in the previous example was based 
on a three-column grid, with the outside column being narrower. Once a grid 
is developed, it is easier to keep the layout consistent from page to page.
Create grids by going to Layout>Create Guides. Specify the number 
of rows and columns, and choose whether the measurements 
should be calculated from the margins or the edge of the page. 
You can specify a gutter width of 0 if no gutter is required.
Creating a Publication Grid
This project will be a quick one. You are still working at your last job—the 
building supply company. Remember that sample newsletter you created? 
The company’s marketing department was so impressed, they asked you 
to design another project—a sales flyer to advertise a new subdivision. 
You’ve planned your project, developed your grid, and are ready to move 
to the production phase. Visual 6–18 shows your finished product.
Setup frames will be used in the creation of this flyer. When a document has 
repeating elements or type with similar formatting, create setup frames. These 
frames act as patterns and can be duplicated as needed. Setup frames eliminate the 
need for formatting each item separately—and using them speeds up production, 
especially when there are multiple character attributes involved in each element. 
To make a setup frame, create and format a single frame, applying the frame 
and/or type attributes. Then, duplicate it as many times as necessary. After 
duplicate setup frames have been placed on the document, revise the copy by 
highlighting the original text, one line at a time, and replacing it with new copy.

1. 
Create a new Letter-size document with a 1" top margin and 0.5" margins on the 
bottom and sides. Choose Layout>Create Guides. Create 5 rows and 3 columns, both 
with 1-pica gutters. Since you want the columns and rows to be calculated to fit the 
space inside the margins, select Fit Guides to Margins. Check Preview and look at your 
screen. Your document should look like Visual 6–19. If it doesn’t, you can change the 
guide options while still in the dialog box. When the guides are correct, press OK.
2. 
Draw a single text frame in the top row of the left column. Use Option+drag 
or Alt+drag to make two more frames. Place them in the top row of the center 
and right columns (Visual 6–19). Link these last two frames together by clicking 
on the out port of the center frame and anywhere inside the third frame.
3. 
In the first column, second row, draw a rectangle frame with a 0.5-pt. 
Black stroke. This will be used to contain a photo. Duplicate the frame five 
times, filling rows 2 and 4 with a total of six frames (Visual 6–19).
4. 
Using the grid as a guide, draw another text frame in 
Row 3, Column 1. Fill with placeholder text. Select all 
the text and change it to Minion Pro 10/12. Type The 
Winona on the first line of text and press Shift+ Return. 
Type starting at $229,900 on the next line and press 
Return. Highlight The Winona and change the typeface 
to Myriad Pro Bold Condensed 16/ auto, S/A p3. Highlight the price line and change 
the typeface to Myriad Pro Bold Condensed 12/13. Delete overset text if necessary. 
Your setup frame containing the type for this flyer is ready to be duplicated (Visual 6–20).

5. 
Option or Alt+drag the setup text box and position in Column 2. Repeat, to place 
another frame in Column 3. Now, select all three frames and use Option or Alt+drag 
to position them in Row 5. Refer to Visual 6–18 to change the name and price for 
each model. Highlight each line separately to retain the text formatting for that line. 
Presently, the descriptive copy for each model is identical. Your sales flyer will look 
more “authentic” if you randomly change the line endings in the descriptive copy 
for each model by deleting copy and adding an occasional Return (Visual 6–18).
6. 
Place the photos. You’ll find them on the accompanying CD in the 06 Artwork 
and Resources folder. Visual 6–19 shows which file to place in each frame. 
Scale and crop the photos similar to those shown in the completed sample in 
Visual 6–18. Make sure each scaled and cropped image fills the entire frame!
7. 
Fill the two linked text frames in the top row with placeholder text. Specify Minion Pro 
10/auto. Type the information in the text frame in Row 1, Column 1. Refer to Visual 6–18 
to enter and format the following lines: Plum Creek: Myriad Pro Bold Condensed 
22/auto; a planned community: Minion Pro Italic 14/16. Bulleted copy: Myriad Pro 
Condensed 14/18, 0.125" left indent. Don’t forget to place a space after each bullet. 
Voila! You’re done. Print out copy to show it to the marketing manager for approval.
Aligning and Distributing Objects
One summer when my husband and I were building a deck on our house, we wanted 
to evenly distribute the railing spindles between the support posts. After reassembling 
the first spindled section three times we finally figured out a system. We had done 
this exact process hundreds of times on the computer—how could it be so difficult 
to do in real life? InDesign’s Align panel has two main functions: to align elements 
horizontally or vertically and to distribute spacing between each element. From the 
06 Artwork and Resources folder, open 06 Align and Distribute. Then, open the Align 
panel by pressing Shift+F7 
or going to Window>Object 
& Layout>Align.

Using the Align Function
In the following exercises you will see how easy it is to build 
a virtual deck railing using the Align panel.
1. 
06 Align and Distribute shows railings and porch 
posts that need to be aligned and distributed 
for our virtual deck railing. As you work through 
this exercise, you will notice that Smart Guides 
also assist you in aligning and distributing 
objects. We’ll use the spindles on the top of the 
page, and the shapes on the bottom, later..
2. 
Select all the porch spindles and posts. 
Press Shift+F7 to open the Align panel. The 
Alignment Location should be set to Align to 
Selection. With Align to Selection specified, 
only the selected elements are taken into 
consideration for alignment decisions. Select 
Align top edges, Align vertical centers, and 
Align bottom edges from the horizontal 
alignment options, and watch as your objects 
snap into formation. When you select Align 
bottom edges, the center bottoms of the 
posts and spindles are aligned (Visual 6–23).
3. 
With the spindles and posts still selected, 
change the Alignment Location to Align to 
Margins. Again, select Align top edges, Align 
vertical centers, and Align bottom edges from 
the horizontal alignment options. With Align 
to Margins selected, the lines are aligned 
and repositioned to the top margin, center 
of page, or to the bottom margin. Keep your 
document open for the next exercise.
When you don’t want something to move, select the object and then lock 
its position by pressing Command+L (Mac) or Control+L (Windows). You 
can also find this command under the Object menu. To unlock the position, 
press Command+Option+L (Mac) or Control+Alt+L (Windows).

Using the Distribute Function
The railing of our virtual deck won’t look correct until the spindles are aligned 
and equally spaced. Distribute Objects creates even spacing between the centers, 
left, or right edges of objects. You can specify a measurement between objects, 
or let InDesign space the objects to fit available space. The Distribute Objects 
options are found below the Align Objects section of the Align panel.
1. 
Select Align to Selection. Align the bottom edges of the spindles and 
posts. Select Use Spacing and specify 0.5" in the field to the right. Then, 
select Distribute horizontal centers. The spindles and posts are now 
spaced exactly 0.5" apart, measured center-to-center (Visual 6–24).
2. 
Uncheck Use Spacing. Change the Alignment Location to Align to Margins 
and select Distribute horizontal centers. Now the spindles and posts are 
equally spaced to the right and left margins of the document. Change 
the location to Align to Page and click Distribute horizontal centers. This 
time, the lines are spaced out to the edges of the document.
Distribute Objects creates even spacing between the centers, left, or right 
edges of objects. However, if you open the Align panel options you will find 
Distribute Spacing, another great way to manage the spacing between objects. 
As you will see in the following exercise, Distribute Spacing is particularly 
suited for using with a series of non-uniform objects, because it equalizes 
the spacing between the left and right edges of adjacent objects.
1. 
Select the shapes at the bottom of the page. Choose Align to 
Selection and then Align vertical centers (Visual 6–25).
VISUAL |6–24 |
Distribute Objects manages 
the spacing between 
objects. In this example, a 
center-to-center spacing of 
0.5” has been specified.
VISUAL |6–25 |
Distribute Spacing is ideal 
for equalizing the white 
space between non-uniform 
objects. Here, shapes are 
first aligned horizontally 
along vertical centers.

|  Chapter 6  |
2. 
With the shapes selected, choose Distribute horizontal space from 
the Distribute Spacing menu options. Now, the same amount 
of white space is between each object (Visual 6–26).
3. 
One final challenge. Roughly reposition the shapes so that they run vertically down 
the page. Your goal will be to align their horizontal centers, spread them to the top 
and bottom margins, and create equal space between each object. You will apply 
the similar Align and Distribute operations as in the previous examples, but you will 
be working vertically. If you need help, refer to the specifications in Visual 6–27.

▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
Other Object Management Techniques
As you have seen in the previous exercises, knowing how to manage elements 
in your document saves time and frustration. The following five exercises 
demonstrate easily mastered techniques to help you manipulate InDesign objects.
Duplicate Using Step and Repeat
1. 
Create a new document and draw a 1.5" square. Fill it with Black. With the square 
selected, press Command+Option+U (Mac) or Control+Alt+U (Windows) to open the 
Step and Repeat dialog box (Visual 6–28). You can also choose Edit>Step and Repeat.
InDesign CS5 has included Smart Dimensions, Smart Object 
Alignment, and Smart Spacing to the Smart Guides preferences.
Smart Guides can be toggled on and off by:
A. Pressing Command+U (Mac) or Control+U (Windows);
B. Under Grids & Guides in the Context menu;
C. Through Menu>View>Grids & Guides; and
D.  By selecting Smart Guides from 
the View Options on the Application 
Frame, above the Control panel.
1.  Smart Dimensions are displayed when
creating or resizing page items.
2.  Smart Object Alignment guides
make it easy to 
align the centers or 
edges of page items.
3.  Smart Spacing 
displays arrow 
guides that show 
when page items 
are evenly spaced.

2. 
Use the dialog box to specify how many additional objects you would like and where 
you would like them positioned, starting from the original object. In the Repeat 
section, enter 5 in the Count field, and click Preview. If InDesign defaults are in place, 
you will see that five additional squares are staggered 0.25" over and down from each 
other. If Step and Repeat coordinates were used previously, the squares are placed 
at whatever settings were used before. (If you get a dialog box that says “Cannot add 
objects beyond the bounds of the pasteboard,” you will have to decrease either the 
number of items to repeat or the distance you want them offset from each other.)
3. 
Now, type 3 in the Count field. In the Offset section enter 2 in the Horizontal field and 
0 in the Vertical field, . Press Return. Your squares should now look like Visual 6–29.
4. 
Undo. Now, type 4 in the Count field, 0 in the Horizontal field, and 2 in the 
Vertical field. There are now five squares equally spaced in a vertical line.
Managing Object Stacking Order
If you have ever stacked pancakes on a plate, you already know the concept 
of object stacking order. In InDesign, each and every object exists in a stacked 
order, according to its order of creation. First objects are lower in the stack. 
InDesign allows you to change the stacking order of objects in your document, 
just like pulling pancakes off the bottom of the stack to place them on the 
top. You can shift the objects from the top of the pile to the bottom of the pile 
by using some great keyboard shortcuts. The following steps demonstrate 
the most common commands used to change an object’s stacking order.
Send Forward, to Front,
Backward, and to Back
1. 
Create a new document. Draw three shapes: a square, 
a circle, and a hexagon (located in the fly out menu 
in the Rectangle tool). Fill the square with Blue, the 
circle with Red, and the hexagon with Yellow.

164
2. 
Move the circle and hexagon so that they slightly overlap the 
square. Your pile of objects should look like Visual 6–30.
3. 
Send Backward and Bring Forward. You have just created a “stack of pancakes” 
and we are going to shuffle their stacking order. Select the hexagon. Press 
Command+[ (Mac) or Control+[ (Windows) and watch the hexagon move back 
one layer. It is now sandwiched between the circle and square. Press the same 
shortcut key and the hexagon will now be at the bottom of the stack. Now, press 
Command+] (Mac) or Control+] (Windows) and the hexagon will come forward 
one layer at a time. Practice sending each object forward and backward until the 
shortcut keys become automatic. All stacking order commands can also be accessed 
by choosing Object>Arrange and then selecting one of the four stacking commands.
4. 
Send to Back and Bring to Front. To send selected objects all the way to the back or to 
the front of the stack, add the Shift key to the shortcut keys you just learned. Send to the 
Back becomes Shift+Command+[ (Mac) or Shift+Control+[ (Windows) and Send to 
the Front becomes Shift+Command+] (Mac) or Shift+Control+] (Windows). Practice 
sending each object to the front and back until the shortcut keys feel comfortable. 
Keep your document open because we are going to use it for the next exercise.
Selecting Stacked Objects
InDesign uses related shortcut keys for related functions, and after a while 
you begin to recognize a pattern. In this exercise you will learn how to select 
items that are stacked on top of each other. Using our pancakes analogy, 
there are times you might want to peek through the stack of pancakes to 
see which has the most (or fewest) blueberries. This exercise demonstrates 
how to select objects that are in the middle of the stack. Begin by layering 
your three shapes in the stacking order shown in Visual 6–31. Use the Align 
commands to line up the center of all the objects. Rather than opening the 
Align panel, find the two Align commands you need in the Control panel.
1. 
Select Through Objects. InDesign allows you to “dig” 
from the top object down through each object layer 
with one simple click. Select the top object with the 
Selection tool, and press Command (Mac) or Control 
(Windows) and click. Each click selects the next 
object below in the stack. Watch the selection handles 
carefully to determine which object is selected.

2. 
Select Next Object Above and Next Object Below. When you want to select an 
item somewhere in the middle of the stack, use Command+Option+[ or ] (Mac) 
or Control+Alt+[ or ] (Windows) and you will move through your stack of shapes. 
Practice moving down and up through your stack. As your documents become 
more complex, the Arrange and Select shortcuts will become indispensable tools. Of 
course, these operations can be completed from the Control panel (Visual 6–32).
Cut, Copy, Paste, Paste Into, Paste in Place
Cut, Copy, and Paste commands are basic functions you may 
already know, but they are so important that they bear repeating. 
InDesign also includes two special Paste features.
The Cut command shortcut is Command+X (Mac) or Control+X (Windows). There 
is a difference between using the Delete key and the Cut command. When you select 
an object and press Delete, the object is gone forever (unless you Undo it). When 
you select an object and choose Cut, the object is removed from your document but 
kept in the short-term memory area of your computer, called the clipboard. The 
clipboard can only hold the contents of one Cut (or Copy) operation at a time, so 
don’t depend on the clipboard for long-term storage. As you will see in the following 
paragraphs, the contents of the clipboard can be accessed using several commands.
The Copy command shortcut is Command+C (Mac) or Control+C (Windows). 
When you select an object and copy it, the object remains in the document and 
a copy of it goes to the clipboard, replacing what was previously stored there.
The Paste command shortcut is Command+V (Mac) or Control+V (Windows). 
When you use this command, whatever is stored in the clipboard will reappear 
on the page you are working on. This means you can paste clipboard items on 
the same page, on a different page, or into a new document. When an object is 
pasted from the clipboard, it will be positioned in the center of the screen.
InDesign’s Paste in Place command is a great function. When you use Paste in Place, 
the object is positioned in the exact same location whether pasted on the same page, 
a different page in the same document, or a page in another InDesign document. The 
shortcut key for Paste in Place is another example of how InDesign shortcut keys are 
related. A regular Paste is Command+V (Mac) or Control+V(Windows). Paste in 
Place is Shift+Option+Command +V (Mac) or Shift+Alt+Control+V (Windows).

InDesign’s Paste Into command is very similar to placing photos inside frames, 
except that it works with objects that InDesign can create or manipulate on screen.
1. 
Draw a black square. We’re going to call this the container.
2. 
Double-click on the Polygon tool to open the Polygon Settings dialog box and 
type 6 in Number of Sides and 40% in the Star Inset field. Click OK and drag a star 
onto your document. Fill the star with [Paper]. The star will be the content.
3. 
Position the content. Select both shapes and, 
using the Align icons on the Control panel, 
center the star horizontally and vertically 
on the square. This establishes the final 
position of the content (see Visual 6–33).
4. 
Cut the content by selecting only the star and 
pressing Command+X (Mac) or Control+X
(Windows). The star is now removed from the 
document and stored in the clipboard.
5. 
Select the square. Use the Paste Into command, 
Command+Option+V (Mac) or Control+Alt+V 
(Windows). This process is also called nesting. 
The image should look like Visual 6–34.
6. 
Use the Selection tool to move the container 
and the content. Use the Direct Selection tool 
and select either the container or the content to 
adjust the size of the container or the position 
of the content. To remove the content, select 
it and use the Cut or Delete command.
Grouping Elements
Combining two or more items into a group is a great way to manage 
multiple design elements. Like individual states within the United States, 
each element retains its unique properties, but all are grouped together to 
form a larger unit. Once a group is created, you can Move, Copy, Cut, and 
Transform the group as a whole. And you can still perform all the functions 
you normally would with each individual member of the group.

1. 
Create a new document. Draw a text frame and a rectangle. Select both objects.
Press Command+G (Mac) or Control+G (Windows). You should see a 
new bounding box that now stretches around both elements. Choose 
the Selection tool and move the items. They will move as a group.
2. 
Double-click an element with the Selection tool to move or edit an element in the 
group independently of the others (Visual 6–35). If you select an item with the Direct 
Selection tool you can manipulate the paths and anchor points on each element.
3. 
Draw a larger rectangle. Select all the objects and create a group. The bounding box 
grows to encompass all the objects. We discussed nesting earlier when we were 
using the Paste Into command. Creating groups within groups is also called nesting.
4. 
To ungroup elements, press Shift+Command+G (Mac) or Shift+Control+G 
(Windows). You must repeat the process to ungroup each nested group.
Control Panel Transformations
The Control panel also allows you to rotate objects. When rotating, you 
must note where the object’s reference point is, because this will be the 
center point for the rotation. Set a percentage in the Rotation Angle field 
and see how this feature works. You can also flop your artwork along the 
horizontal or vertical axis. Visual 6–36 shows many panel options.

CS5 simplified transformations
CS5 has made it easier to transform objects. Here is a list of new transformation features:
▶  Double-click behavior. Double-clicking on a graphic frame selects the content in the 
frame. When the content is selected, double-clicking it will select the container.
▶  Frame edge highlighting. As you mouse over items with the Direct Selection tool, InDesign will 
temporarily display the frame edges. This makes it easy to find the item you want before you select it. 
It also helps you identify grouped items. This even works when you are working in Preview Mode.
▶  Path and point highlighting. When you hover over an item with the Direct 
Selection tool, InDesign displays the path and path points.
▶  Resize and scale multiple selected items. You don’t have to group items before you resize or scale or 
them. Just select the items you wish to transform, 
and you will see a transformation bounding box 
around the selected items. Dragging a handle 
will resize the elements. Pressing Shift will 
resize them proportionately. Pressing the Cmd 
or Control key will scale them, Shift+Cmd or 
Shift+Control will scale them proportionately.
▶  Rotate items. With the Selection tool, position the 
pointer just outside a corner handle and the cursor will 
change to the Rotate cursor. Drag to rotate the item.
▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
The Control panel also includes a Shear function, which makes your type or 
object oblique. This can be great for modifying frames and shapes, but please 
restrain yourself from using this tool for making fake italics or an oblique 
typeface. As a professional artist, you should use an oblique or italic font designed 
by a professional typographer rather than hacking out one of your own.
▶ production tip
Never use the Shear 
function to make a fake 
italic or oblique typeface. 
Purchase one, instead.

1. 
For what types of documents should you make presets?
2. 
What is the measurement of a standard bleed?
3. 
What are some advantages of using columns and guides?
4. 
Why are a reader’s first impressions of a newsletter (or any document you design) so critical?
5. 
What are some characteristics of the three types of newsletters described in this chapter?
6. 
What is the purpose of using a baseline grid?
7. 
What is the difference between using the Cut command or pressing the Delete key?
8. 
What is a setup frame? When and how do you use one?
9. 
Explain the difference between using Step and Repeat, and the Align panel.
10. 
What are some advantages in grouping items together? What is nesting?
11. 
Explain how to rearrange the order of stacked objects using keyboard shortcuts.
12. 
What is the process for changing the Document Setup default, for instance, to turn off Facing Pages?
13. 
You have several shapes exactly stacked on each other. What is the keyboard shortcut 
for selecting through objects, without rearranging the stacking order?
14. 
You have an image of a person placed exactly where you want it on a layout. Unfortunately, the person 
in the photo is pointing—and leading the reader’s eye—right off the page. You decide to fix the problem 
by flipping the photo horizontally so that the image will point into the page. However, every time you 
use the transform panel to flip the image, the actual location of the image frame also moves. How 
can you remedy this situation, so that the picture is flipped and remains in exactly the same spot?
15. 
You have several objects that need their top edges aligned. You have opened the Align panel and have 
clicked on the Align Top Edges icon. Nothing is happening. What step in the process are you forgetting?

▶ CHAPTER 6 PROJECTS
The projects begin with a review of basic tabs and tables functions. The Lost Road to Houston will give you 
a sneak preview of feathering, an edge treatment often used with photos. Align and Distribute operations 
will be the focus of the children’s CD cover design. The Fishing Trip Guide and design invoice will incorporate 
table functions, distribute objects, tabs, and indents. The final project is a bill stuffer—the kind you receive 
each month in your credit card bill. Directions and files for each project can be found in the 06 Artwork and 
Resources folder on the Exploring Adobe InDesign CS5 CD.

introduction
My daughter owns a rescued greyhound named Penny. Once we took her to a large 
baseball field to see just how fast this dog could run. Penny was trembling with 
excitement, eager to run. When we released her, she was off like a speeding bullet.
Like Penny, you have been training to race. You have learned many InDesign basics and 
are now “trembling at the end of your leash” waiting to be let loose. Beginning with 
this chapter, Exploring Adobe InDesign CS5 will be more production-based, building on 
previously learned skills while introducing new techniques and typographic principles.
Now that you’ve mastered the basics of production, we’ll be adding techniques that will make your 
production process easier and more enjoyable. This chapter will focus on text wrap and layers, but 
will also introduce some great new features of InDesign CS5—the Gap tool and corner effects. You 
will also learn how to apply feathering, drop shadows, and other transparency effects to objects.
Congratulations—you’re half done with the book! Feel free to e-mail me 
and let me know how you’re doing—trydberg@mac.com.

Integrating Text and Graphics
Text and graphics need to work together. It’s important to match the 
personality of the typeface with the style of the graphic. It is also important 
to create a visual link between the graphic and the text that accompanies 
it. In design terms, this is called the principle of proximity. One method 
of visually linking text and graphics is by using text wrap.
An Introduction to Text Wrap
Text wrap is the process of flowing text around a graphic or shape. Think of 
text as a river that flows smoothly until it hits a rock—a shape or graphic. 
The river might go around the rock or over the rock, but in either case, it just 
keeps flowin’ along. You can control how the river of text flows around shapes 
or graphics by applying text wrap options. Open 07 Text Wrap.indd from the 
CD that accompanies this text. As you work through each step, make the changes 
in the Text Wrap panel and reposition the image, as shown in each example.
1. 
Open the Text Wrap panel by pressing Command+Option+W (Mac) or 
Control+Alt+W (Windows). You can also access the Text Wrap panel by 
choosing Window>Text Wrap (but using the menus rather than using keyboard 
shortcuts is always slower). Each button on the panel activates a different text 
wrap mode. Visual 7–1 provides an overview of the Text Wrap panel.
VISUAL | 7–1 |
The Text Wrap panel contains 
five buttons that alter the 
flow of text around objects.

2. 
In this exercise, the bobber is the “rock” in the middle of your text flow. The 
object that the text is wrapping around is referred to as the wrap object. 
Whenever you are applying a text wrap option you must first select the wrap 
object. Select the bobber and notice that the first text wrap option, No text 
wrap, is selected in the Text Wrap panel. This option is the default. When No 
text wrap is active, the text can flow over or under the object (Visual 7–2).
3. 
Select the bobber with the Selection tool and choose the second button, Wrap 
around bounding box. Make sure that the link button is selected, and enter 0.25" in 
any of the four Offset fields. As shown in Visual 7–3, you will see two boxes around the 
bobber: the inside box is the bounding box, and the outside box shows the location 
of a 0.25" text offset that has been applied on all sides of the bounding box. As you 
can see, text offsets are ideal for adding white space between copy and images. To 
create different text offsets on individual sides of the bounding box, deselect the 
link icon in the middle of the Offset fields and specify different values in the fields.

Select the third option, Wrap around object shape, also known as contour wrapping. In 
this mode, you have several options from which to choose. Under Wrap Options, you can 
specify where the text will be positioned. In Visual 7–4, Wrap to Left Side has allowed text 
to wrap on the left side of the graphic, but not on the right. Reposition the bobber on 
your page as you experiment with the other wrap options. The first three Wrap Options, 
Left Side, Right Side, and Both Right & Left Sides, will be the ones you will use most often. 
The Contour Options section allows you to specify how the text will interact with the 
shape. In Visual 7–4 the Contour Options is set to follow the shape of the Graphic Frame.
In Visual 7–5, the Wrap Options have been set to Both Right & Left Sides, and Detect 
Edges has been specified under Contour Options. With Detect Edges selected, 
InDesign finds the edges of the image inside the bounding box. In this example, 
you can see how the specified offset follows the contour of the shape.

The fourth option is Jump object. In this mode, the text leap frogs 
over the object to the next available space. Jump object keeps text 
from appearing on either side of the frame. (Visual 7–6).

Select the bobber and change the text wrap to Wrap around object shape, set the 
Contour Options to Detect Edges. Position the bobber in the middle of the first 
column. Draw a circle, move it to the center of the second column, and give it a 
background color of [None]. Apply Wrap around object shape and turn on the Invert 
option. With Invert selected, the text flows inside the selected object (Visual 7–8).
An Introduction to Document Layers
In the last chapter you were introduced to the stacking order of InDesign 
objects, which was compared to a stack of pancakes. You used keyboard 
shortcuts to rearrange the objects in the stack. In this chapter, you will learn 
to create and use document layers. Document layers are like a stack of plates, 
each plate holding its own pile of pancakes. Document layers are easy to 
understand, and they simplify the production of complex projects.

In this next exercise, you will use the Layers panel to build a cheeseburger, 
with artwork provided by illustrator, David Espurvoa III. You will find it 
in the 07 Artwork and Resources folder on the accompanying CD.
1. 
Open 07 Document Layers.indd from the 07 Artwork and Resources folder. Press F7 
to open the Layers panel. Every new InDesign document starts with one layer. By 
default, this is named Layer 1. Click on the tomatoes, and you will see a blue square 
appear next to the pen icon, on the right side of the Layers panel. This square shows 
that the item you have selected is on Layer 1. In fact, the bun, lettuce, cheese, 
hamburger, and bacon are also on Layer 1. When you deselect all the images, 
Layer 1 displays a grayed square, indicating that nothing is selected on Layer 1.
2. 
Select each of the ingredients and 
position them to build a cheeseburger. 
You are actually manipulating the 
stacking order of objects, because all 
the objects are contained on the same 
layer. You can use keyboard shortcuts 
to select and rearrange the stacking 
order of the images. You can also use the 
Select previous object and Select next object 
tools on the Control panel (Visual 7–10). 
When the Command (Mac) or Control 
(Windows) key is also pressed, Select previous object becomes Select 
first object, and Select next object becomes Select last object.
Features of the Layers Panel
In the previous step, you experienced how difficult 
it can be to navigate through a complicated stack 
of objects. In the next step, you’re going to take 
control and move the ingredients to separate 
document layers. But before we go there, let’s 
take a closer look at some of the features in 
the Layers panel, as shown in Visual 7–11. On 
the left side of the panel, you can see an eye 
icon. This is the visibility control. When this 
icon is displayed, the layer is visible. Click the 
icon, and watch the cheeseburger disappear. 
Now this layer is hidden. Click the icon again, and the cheeseburger reappears. 
This is a nice feature—text, guides, and elements can be hidden, as needed.

Next to the eye icon there is an empty box. When you click the box a lock
icon appears to show that the layer is locked, and you can no longer edit its 
elements. Like the eye icon, clicking this control repeatedly toggles it on and 
off. To the right of the lock is a vertical, blue line. The blue line corresponds 
to the selection marks color used to display the bounding boxes, frames, 
and guides that are selected on a particular layer. (Visual 7–12).
To the right of the selection marks color, 
you will see that this layer is named Layer 1. 
The pen icon at the right end of the Layers 
panel indicates which layer you are currently 
working on, called the current drawing layer 
If a layer is locked, the pen icon will have a 
red, diagonal line through it (Visual 7–12). 
Finally, notice the disclosure triangle to the 
left of the layer name. When you click on 
this triangle, the panel expands to show the 
objects, in their stacking order, on that layer. 
You can click on each item and drag it up 
or down in the list to rearrange the stacking 
order. You can also hide or show individual items by clicking the eye icon next to 
the item’s stacking order (Visual 7–12). Now, we’ll continue with our layers exercise.
3. 
Unlock Layer 1 and close the disclosure triangle. Double-click on the title, Layer 1, 
to open the Layer Options dialog box. Here you can change the name of the 
layer and the color of the selection marks, and perform other housekeeping 
functions such as Suppress Text Wrap When Layer Is Hidden. When you select 
this option, any text wrap mode you have applied to an object will be turned 
off when you hide the layer. While you are in this dialog box, change the 
name of the layer to Text and click OK (Visual 7–13). Next, create a text frame 
and type Wisconsin Cheeseburger underneath the image. We’re going use 
this layer for text only, and move the images to new document layers.

4. 
There are two methods for creating new 
document layers. For the first method, 
click the Create new layer icon in the lower 
right corner of the panel (Visual 7–14). A 
new layer will appear in the panel, named 
Layer 2. Double-click the name of the layer 
to open the Layer Options dialog box. 
Rename the layer Bottom Bun and click 
OK. A new layer, Bottom Bun, is now shown 
in the Layers panel, above the Text layer.
5. 
The second method for creating layers is 
particularly convenient, because the New 
Layer dialog box is automatically opened 
with the Name field highlighted. Hold down 
Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) and click the 
Create new layer icon at the bottom of the 
panel. Type Hamburger in the Name field 
and press Return. Repeat this process and 
make the following three layers: 1) Lettuce and 
Tomatoes, 2) Cheese and Bacon, and 3) Top 
Bun. You can lengthen the Layers panel by pulling on the lower right corner. 
Six named layers should be visible in the Layers panel (Visual 7–15).
6. 
Select the top bun of the 
cheeseburger. In the Layers 
panel, the Text layer is 
highlighted and the pen 
icon with a blue box next 
to it, appears. This indicates 
that the item you have 
selected is currently located 
on the Text layer. Click on 
the blue box and drag it up 
to the layer named Top Bun 
(Visual 7–16). When you release 
the mouse, notice that the frame guides for the bun illustration are the same 
color as the selection marks color indicator in the Top Bun layer. Hide the 
Top Bun layer by clicking the eye icon to the left of the layer name.

7. 
Open the disclosure triangle on the Text layer. Select the cheese image. You will 
know it is selected when a blue square appears in the Layers panel next to the file 
name. It might be difficult to select the cheese image among all the other stacked 
objects. If so, you may need to drill down through the stacked objects by using the 
Command+Click (Mac) or Control+Click (Windows) technique. When the cheese 
image is selected, move the blue square to the Cheese and Bacon layer. Use the same 
technique to select the bacon illustration and move it to the Cheese and Bacon layer.
Hide this layer. Select the lettuce and tomatoes and move them to the Lettuce and 
Tomatoes layer. Hide the layer. Select the hamburger, and move it to the Hamburger
layer. Hide the layer. Select the bottom bun and move it to the Bottom Bun layer.
8. 
Show all layers. The cheeseburger might not look very presentable because 
pieces of artwork may need to be repositioned. You can open the disclosure 
triangle in the Lettuce and Tomatoes and Cheese and Bacon layers and simply 
move the square of the selected object to rearrange the stacking order. Or 
you can alternately hide and show layers to select specific pieces of artwork 
and shift their positions until you have a nice, thick hamburger.
9. 
In this step you will reposition the stacking order of the document layers. Your goal will 
be to arrange the layers in the order shown in Visual 7–17. The bottom layer should be 
the Text layer. To move a layer’s position, click and drag it up or down. When you select 
the layer, the pointer will turn into a closed fist, and a heavy black line will indicate 
where the layer will be positioned when you release the mouse. Repeat this process 
to position each layer in the order shown in Visual 7–17. Keep your document open.

Managing Text Wrap with Layers and Text Frame Options
There are text wrap controls in the Layers panel and in the Text 
Frame Options panel that you should be aware of. These features 
are often overlooked, so take the time to study this section.
1. 
In the document you were just working 
on, lock all the layers, except Bottom 
Bun and Text. Select the Wisconsin 
Cheeseburger type frame and position 
it so the top of the frame touches the 
frame of the bottom bun illustration. 
Make Bottom Bun the drawing layer. 
Use the Selection tool to select the 
frame for the bottom bun image. 
Activate Wrap around bounding box 
from the Control panel. Visual 7–18 
shows how the text reflows around the bounding box of the bottom bun. 
Depending on the size of your text frame, the text may even disappear 
altogether when text wrap is applied to the hamburger bun!
2. 
Double-click the Bottom Bun layer to 
open the Layer Options dialog box 
(Visual 7–19). Check Suppress Text 
Wrap When Layer is Hidden. Press 
Return. Hide the Bottom Bun layer, and 
you will see the text reflow as if the 
object wasn’t even there. Make the 
Bottom Bun layer visible once more 
and the text wrap will be activated.
3. 
This technique mentioned earlier 
bears repeating: you can override the 
text wrap for individual text frames. 
Select the text frame and press 
Command+B (Mac) or Control+B 
(Windows) to open the Text Frame 
Options dialog box (or choose Object> 
Text Frame Options). Select Ignore 
Text Wrap at the bottom of the dialog 
box and click OK (Visual 7–20).

Using Layers to Create Two Versions of a Document
Now that you have created, repositioned, locked, and hidden layers, you probably 
realize the production opportunities Layers offer. In the next project, you will 
design a page for a recipe book, featuring recipes from all over the United States 
(Visual 7–21). You will use layers to construct this document so it contains two 
versions of a chocolate chip cookie recipe—one designed for home bakers, and 
a big-batch version intended for institutional cooking. You will also use the 
features of a recent font technology called OpenType to create true fractions.

1. 
Create a new document. 
Document size: 8.5"× 11".
Top, bottom, and right margins: 
0.5". Left margin: 0.75" (to 
accommodate spiral binding). 
Click OK. Press F7 to open the 
Layers panel. Change the name 
of Layer 1 to Picture. Draw a 
frame from margin to margin. 
Place 07 Cookies.tif from the 
07 Artwork and Resources folder and scale proportionately to 145%. (The photo will 
not reach to the bottom margin.) Reset the zero point to the far right edge of the photo 
and drop in a vertical guide at -0.25" on the X coordinate (Visual 7–23). Lock this layer.
2. 
Create a new layer and name it Consumer Recipe. Type the copy and follow the type 
specifications shown in Visual 7–24. Use three text frames, creating a 2-column frame 
for the ingredients. Do not place a space after the whole number in the fractions. 
Creating fractions is an easy process when OpenType is being used. Highlight the 
numerator, slash, and denominator, and choose OpenType>Fractions from the Control 
panel menu. Repeat the process for each fraction. Or, highlight the ½   fraction, Copy and 
Paste it as needed. Be sure to check spelling and use the correct hyphens and dashes.

3. 
Create a new layer and name it Industrial Recipe. You are going to duplicate 
the type from the Consumer Recipe layer, and move it to the Industrial Recipe
layer. Afterwards, you will double the ingredients for the Industrial Recipe version. 
Click on the Consumer Recipe layer in the Layers panel. Choose the Selection tool, 
and Shift+Click each text frame so that they are all selected. The small red box 
showing in the Consumer Recipe layer represents the three text frames you have 
just selected. Press Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) while you move the red square 
up to the Industrial Recipe layer. As the Option or Alt key is held, you will see a 
plus sign appear which means a duplicate is being created on the next layer.
4. 
Hide the Consumer Recipe layer. Move to the Industrial Recipe layer and 
change the title to Big Batch of Chocolate Chip Cookies. Then, double 
the recipe ingredients (Visual 7–25). Save your document and print a 
copy of the Industrial Recipe version. Hide the Industrial Recipe layer and 
show the Consumer Recipe layer. Print the Consumer Recipe version.

Designing a CD Cover
Our next project will be the full-bleed CD cover, shown in Visual 7–26. It will require 
you to create guides, use text wrap, and work on different layers. You will also be 
introduced to two new features: 
transparency and feathering.
1. 
Create a new document, choosing 
Compact Disc from the Page Size 
presets list. Margins: Top and 
Bottom 0.25"; Left and Right 
0.125". Add a 0.125" bleed 
on all sides. Click OK. Choose 
Layout>Create Guides and make 
two rows and two columns, both 
with a gutter width of 0 and 
select Fit Guides to Margins. Your 
file should look like Visual 7–27.

2. 
Rename Layer 1 to Guides. You will be able to toggle the guides off and on as desired. 
Create a new layer and name it Photo. Place the 07 Convergence.psd image file found in 
the 07 Artwork and Resources folder on the CD. It should stretch from bleed to bleed.
3. 
Select the Polygon tool and click on the document. Enter 6 in Number of 
Sides and 0% in Star Inset. Resize the polygon so that it stretches to the 
margins (Visual 7–28). Select the Type tool and click in the polygon frame. 
Open the Text Frame Options dialog box, Command+B (Mac) or Control+B 
(Windows), and specify a two-column text frame, gutter 0.125".
4. 
Fill the text frame with placeholder text and format it as Myriad Pro Condensed 
11/auto. Color the text [Paper]. Text that is the color of the paper is called reverse 
type. Apply justified horizontal alignment, removing returns as needed to create 
even edges along the text frame and inside column guides (Visual 7–29).

5. 
Activate the hexagon text frame. Remove the stroke. Locate the Opacity field on the 
Control panel (Visual 7–30). Enter 50 into the Opacity field and press Return. This creates 
a transparent effect on the type in the hexagonal text frame. On this CD project, the 
placeholder text is used simply as additional texture. Because the transparent effect 
reduces the readability of text, you will always need to use this function carefully.
6. 
Create a new layer and name it Title. Draw a text frame from the left to the right 
margin guides, H: 0.65". Position the frame against the top margin guide. In this 
frame, type Convergence, Minion Pro Regular 30/36. Second line: Images and 
Poetry by Nichole Graham, Minion Pro Regular, 14/18.8. Align center and color 
Paper. Open the Text Wrap panel and select Wrap around bounding box. Specify a 
0.125" bottom offset. Although this text frame is on its own layer, it still affects the 
type on other layers. InDesign’s text wrapping capability is layer independent.
7. 
Create a new layer and name it Circles. 
Select the Ellipse tool. Press Shift+Option 
(Mac) or Shift+Alt (Windows) and 
beginning on the center vertical 
guide, draw a 1" circle in the upper 
half of the text area. The circle should 
not have a stroke or fill. Open the Text 
Wrap panel and select Wrap around 
object shape, offset 0.0625". Since 
the object is a circle, only one offset 
field is active in the Text Wrap panel.

8. 
Press Shift+Option (Mac) or Shift+Alt (Windows) and draw a 0.5" circle at the bottom 
of the text with the bottom edge of the circle near the bottom margin. Fill the circle 
with [Paper]. In the Text Wrap panel, specify Wrap around object shape, 0.0625" offset. 
Choose Object>Effects>Basic Feather. Enter 0.1" in the Feather Width field, set the 
Corners option to Diffused and press Return. Feathering creates soft edges and is a nice 
design touch. Adjust the transparency of this object to 50%. Choose View>Display 
Performance> High Quality Display to see a high-resolution view of the feathering and 
transparency effects that you have used (Visual 7–32).9.  Your CD cover is complete.
9. 
Deselect all. Select Bleed from the view options 
at the bottom of the Toolbox (Visual 7–33). In this 
mode you can see the 0.125" bleed that extends 
from all four edges. Save and print your project. In 
the Print dialog box, choose the Setup page and 
select Centered in the Page Position field. Print two 
versions of the CD cover: In Version 1, deselect Use 
Document Bleed Settings on the Marks and Bleed 
page of the Print dialog box. Version 1 will show just 
the trim size. For Version 2, select Use Document Bleed 
Settings and specify All Printer’s Marks. Compare 
the two prints, noticing that the bleed print has 
2 sets of corner marks—an inner set to show the 
trim size, and an outer set to show the bleed size.

Designing a Magazine Cover
Our last project will use transparency, feathering, drop shadow, type effects, layers, 
and two new features in InDesign CS5, Live Corner Effects and the Gap tool. The 
project is already roughed out. You will add the final touches. One caveat—use 
effects sparingly. Using too many effects is like using too many typefaces and results 
in a layout that looks less than professional. When in doubt, don’t add an effect!

Open 07 American Country, found in the 07 Artwork and Resources folder on 
the CD. Press F7 to open the Layers panel. There are four layers, with three 
hidden. First, look at the first layer, Photo and color bars. This locked layer 
contains the main image for the magazine. The image sits inside a container 
that is filled with the rust color. This is more efficient than creating separate 
colored rectangles and placing them on the top and bottom of the layout.
2. 
Click the eye to turn on the Inset Photos layer. We’re going to use the three photos on 
the top of the page to learn about the Gap tool. The Gap tool, new in InDesign CS5, 
provides a fast way to adjust the size of a gap between two or more items. Select the 
Gap tool and hover your mouse over the gap between the left and center barn inset 
shot. As you click and drag the Gap tool to the left and the right, the photos are resized 
and the gap remains the same size (Visual 7–34). Release the Gap tool and Undo.
3. 
Select the Gap tool again. This time, hold down Command (Mac) or Control 
(Windows) as you drag the tool over the gap. You will see that the gap between the 
photos resizes, cropping the image (Visual 7–35). Release the Gap tool and Undo.
4. 
For the last experiment with the Gap tool, hold the Option (Mac) or 
Alt (Windows) key when using the Gap tool. Now the images move with the 
gap. Nothing is resized. (Visual 7–36). Release the Gap tool and Undo.

Turn on the visibility of the Nameplate layer. Fill the type with C29, M78, Y100, K26. 
Add a Black stroke. Open the Stroke panel and change the weight to 0.5 pt. Select the 
text frame with the Selection tool, and you’re ready to add some effects to the type.
The Effects Panel
The Effects panel can be found on the Control panel or it can be opened by
Shift+Command+F10 (Mac) or Shift+Control+F10 (Windows). When adding an 
effect, the first thing to decide is whether the effect will be on the type, the fill, the 
stroke, or the object. The object receiving the effect is called the target. Visual 7–37 
shows the Effects controls accessed through the Control panel. The left control in the 
grouping, the Apply Effect to control, is your starting point. This drop down menu 
lets you select the target for the effect. Here’s what happens when you select each one:
 
▶Object–When you select object, the entire object—fill, 
stroke, and text—will have the special effect.
 
▶Graphic–When you select a graphic with the Direct Selection tool, 
the effect is only applied to the graphic inside the frame.
 
▶Stroke–When an effect is applied to a stroke, the gap color is also affected.
 
▶Fill–Only the fill is given an effect when this is selected.
 
▶Text–You can’t apply an effect to individual words. When you select 
“Text,” only the text inside the object—not the text frame—will be 
given an effect. Select the text frame with the Selection tool.
Below the Apply Effect to control is the Opacity control. This is a simple slider 
that makes an item transparent, ranging from 0% (invisible) to 100% (opaque). 
A transparency is not the same as a tint. A tinted box and a transparent box 
might look the same. But when placed on top of another object, the tinted box is 
still opaque, while the transparent box allows background images to be seen.
The Drop Shadow button (Visual 7–37) adds the default drop shadow to the 
selected object, fill, text, or stroke. The default opacity of the drop shadow 
is 75%, which is too dark for many applications. When that is the case, you 
will click the fx button to open the drop down menu, select Drop Shadow,

and change the opacity in the dialog box. You can also open the Effects panel 
by using the keyboard shortcuts or go to Window>Effects (Visual 7–38). 
Always select the effect’s target first, then select the effect. Now let’s go back 
to our magazine cover project and add some effects to the nameplate.
6. 
Select the nameplate with the Selection tool. From the Control panel, select the 
target Text from the drop down menu under the Apply Effect to icon. Choose Bevel 
and Emboss under the fx icon on the Control panel. When the window opens, notice 
that Text appears in the Settings for field in the upper left corner. This means the 
effect will only apply to the text. Experiment with various effects listed in the left 
pane by clicking in the box next to the name to turn on the effect and open the 
dialog. Apply different effects settings, clicking Preview to see how each variation 
looks. When you’re done experimenting, uncheck all the effects in the left pane, 
except for Bevel and Emboss. Enter the values shown in Visual 7–39 in the Bevel and 
Emboss dialog box to achieve the effect shown in the magazine cover example.
7. 
Go to the Layers panel and make the Copy layer visible. Select the star 
burst in the upper right corner. Rotate it -16° around the center reference 
point and use the icons in the Control panel to add a drop shadow.
8. 
Select the white box that says, the wonders of lambing. The background needs 
to be made transparent, and a feather added to the edges. Choose Fill from the 
Apply Effect to icon on the Control panel. Then reduce the transparency to 60%.

Select Basic Feather under the fx icon, 
and accept the default values.
Live Corner Effects
The last effect we will use is Live Corner 
Effects. This new feature, added to the 
Control panel of InDesign CS5, allows 
you to add different corner options to 
individual corners of a frame. Open the 
Corner Options dialog by pressing Option
(Mac) or Alt (Windows) and clicking 
on the icon 
 in the Control panel. The 
Corner Options dialog shows a proxy 
which represents each corner of a frame. In this case, we want an inverted 
curve in the upper-right corner of each text frame along the bottom of the 
magazine cover. This step will add the finishing touch to our magazine cover.
9. 
First, Shift+click to select the four green boxes on the bottom of the magazine cover. 
Then, open the Corner Options dialog box by pressing Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) 
and clicking on the Corner Options icon in the Control panel (Visual 7–40). Deselect 
the Make all Settings the Same link in the middle of the dialog box. Then, find the 
proxy with a tiny blue box in upper right corner. From the pull down menu, choose 
Inverse Rounded and enter the value of .3125". Your magazine cover is complete!
Summary
You are well on your way to being comfortable with the expansive and powerful 
features of InDesign. With each chapter you have methodically added skill “layers” 
to your repertoire. Those projects that seemed so difficult in the early chapters would 
now be quite easy! In this chapter you created and manipulated document layers. You 
also were introduced to OpenType, text wrap, effects and live corner options, and you 
created three great projects. Congratulations on all you have achieved!

introduction
It’s amazing how often we make extra work for ourselves before we wise up. Years ago, we 
hung a small bell by our door and trained our dog to ring it each time he needed to go 
outside. The method was successful—at first. But it didn’t take him long to realize that 
whenever he rang the bell we came running. He began to ring it whenever he was bored, 
lonesome, hungry, or just wanted to go out and play. It was hard to tell who was better 
trained—the dog or the dog owners. After the hundredth trip going back and forth to the 
door, we knew we needed to take control of the situation, and the bell came down.
When you are typesetting a project and it dawns on you that you’re repeating the same actions 
over and over, it’s time to look for a way to reduce your workload and take control. That’s 
what this chapter is all about. You will use paragraph and character styles to automate your 
text formatting, speed up production, and bring typographic consistency to your documents. 
After reading this chapter, you will wonder how you ever got along without them!

Creating a Newsletter
In this lesson you will create a four-page newsletter for a veterinary service. The 
veterinarian, Dr. John Hallett, has supplied you with copy and photos. Visual 
8–1 shows the finished newsletter, created in facing pages and printed on 
11" × 17" paper. The newsletter is printed back-to-back and folded, making 
a total of four pages. A PDF file is also included in the Chapter 08 Artwork 
and Resources folder on the accompanying CD. You may want to print this 
newsletter sample and use it as a reference as you work through the chapter.

This single project will introduce you to the Pages 
panel, and will make use of Snippets. The copy has 
been prepared for you—your job is to place it and 
format it. As you build the newsletter, you will create 
typographic consistency from page to page, by using 
the Eyedropper tool, and creating paragraph and 
character styles, using the following techniques:
▶Creating styles from sample text
▶Transferring styles from another
InDesign document
▶Creating styles based on other styles
▶Creating a new style
▶Duplicating existing styles
▶Bringing in styles with a new element
▶Creating character styles
▶Redefining styles
About Facing Pages
Up to now, we have worked on single-page documents. 
But many—probably most—of your projects will have 
multiple left and right pages printed back-to-back. These 
publications are set up using the Facing Pages option in 
the New Document dialog box. When a document is 
created as facing pages, the Left and Right margin fields 
change to Inside and Outside margins. When more than 
one page butts up to another, it is called a spread. Odd-
numbered pages are always right-hand (recto) pages, and 
even-numbered pages are always left-hand (verso) pages.
Take a single piece of paper and fold it from side to 
side. Hold the paper so the fold is on the left and it 
opens like a booklet. The fold of your booklet is the 
spine. The cover of your booklet is page 1, a right-
hand page. Open the booklet and you will see a spread 
made up of pages 2 and 3. The back cover is page 4, a 
left-hand page. So, a four-page, 8½  " × 11" newsletter, 
printed two-sided on one, 11" × 17" sheet, consists 
of two spreads, or four 8½  " × 11" facing pages.
preparing copy
WHEN CLIENTS PROVIDE COPY
When a client is going to supply the copy 
in electronic format, you should discuss 
exactly how the copy will be prepared. 
Here are some text file considerations 
worth discussing with your clients:
▶  Save each article as a separate file 
and name each file by its headline.
▶  Place only one space between sentences. 
Double spaces need to be manually 
removed during typesetting.
▶  Place only one return between paragraphs. 
Extra returns must be manually removed 
during the typesetting process.
▶  Press the Tab key only once when 
typing tabular copy (don’t keep 
pressing the Tab key until the copy 
lines up). Let the typesetter set the 
tab stops to align the copy.
▶  Don’t press the Tab key to create a first 
line indent on a new paragraph. A first line 
indent will be created during typesetting.
▶  Don’t type anything in all capital letters. 
Emphasis will be added by using bold or 
italic, during the typesetting process.
BECOME INDISPENSABLE!
Your extra effort will earn you the loyalty 
of the your customers. Take the time to 
double check times, dates, phone numbers, 
the correct spelling of names, and web 
addresses contained in customer-supplied 
copy. Finding a single error will create 
a greater chance of repeat business.

Introducing the Pages Panel
Open the Pages panel by pressing Command+F12 (Mac) or F12 (Windows), or 
by choosing Menu>Window>Pages. Notice that the Pages panel is divided into 
two sections by a separator that can be dragged up and down like a window 
shade. The top section of the panel is the master, or global level. The pages at this 
level are called Masters and the settings and options you apply to them affect the 
whole document. The top, single master page is named [None]. The two-page 
spread below it is named A-Master. The A-Master spread consists of a left-hand 
and a right-hand facing page. When you are working with facing pages, the 
pages are displayed differently than non-facing pages. The lower section of the 
Pages panel is the local level. Each page or spread is butted up to a vertical line 
representing the spine of the publication. Odd-numbered pages are always to the 
right of the spine, and even-numbered pages are always to the left of the spine.
We will be covering the Pages panel in detail, in Chapter 9. Let’s get started 
by creating a new document for our newsletter project, beginning with 
formatting the exterior size and interior margins and columns.
1. 
Create a new letter-size document. Number of pages: 4; Facing Pages: On; Columns: 4; 
Gutter Width: 0.1875" Top, Bottom, and Outside margins: 0.5"; Inside margin: 0.25".
At the bottom of the Pages panel is the Create new page icon. Click to add one new 
page at a time to the end of the document. Use Option+click (Mac) or Alt+click
(Windows) to open the Insert Pages dialog box for more page options, such as how 
many new pages to create, where to place them in the document, or what master 
page should be applied. In the lower right corner is the Delete selected pages icon.

Delete a page by dragging it to the can or by selecting it and clicking the can. Add 
and delete a few pages to your document to see how this works, but be sure to end 
up with 4 pages. Notice that the document’s interior pages are displayed in spreads.
You can move from page to page in your document by double-clicking on each 
page icon in the Pages panel. To select a whole spread, double-click on the numbers 
below the spread. When you’re working in facing pages, you will want to view entire 
spreads. Press Command+Option+0 (Mac) or Control+Alt+0 (Windows) to fit the 
spread in your window. Click on the panel menu at the top right, to view a menu 
of additional options. If you choose Panel Options, which opens the Panel Options 
dialog box, you can adjust the panel display by checking the Show Vertically box and 
choosing what size the page icons should be. Visual 8–3 shows the panel displaying 
pages with extra large page icons. Experiment with these options and adjust the panel 
to suit your preferences. Let’s get back to setting up the pages for the newsletter.
How to Begin a Document With a Spread
If you look at the Pages panel, you will 
see that page one is a recto page, and is 
followed by a spread, and a verso fourth 
page. By default, a new document starts 
with page 1, a single, recto page. Because 
our four-page newsletter only needs the 
two spreads, we are going to do a work-
around and create a document that begins 
with a spread instead of a single page.

Open the Pages menu and 
deselect Allow Document Pages 
to Shuffle (Visual 8–4).

Select Page 4 by clicking on it. Drag it up to the left of Page 1. When you see a fist, 
the arrow pointing left, and a bracket, you can release the mouse (Visual 8–5).
4. 
Now your document should consist of two spreads. This will make printing 
the newsletter much easier, but now the physical page numbers do not 
correspond to the pages of the newsletter. Refer to Visual 8–6 to determine 
the newsletter page location as you continue with your project. The 
pages will be referenced by the colored labels shown in Visual 8–6.

On the front cover, pull a horizontal guide down from the top to 2.25" on the 
Y  coordinate.
6. 
Double-click on the numbers below the Page 2 and 3 spread in the Pages panel. 
Create a horizontal guide at 1.65" on the Y coordinate by first clicking a spot on the 
ruler that is outside the document’s page area. Now drag down the guide, noticing 
that the guide stretches across the whole spread. (When you drag a guide down 
from the ruler by clicking above the page you are working on, the guide covers 
only that page.) If you can’t exactly position the guide at 1.65", with the guide 
selected, type 1.65 in the Y field of the control panel. Save your document.
Using Snippets
When you do a lot of design work for a single client, you usually have elements 
that are used over and over again. For instance, if you did weekly advertisements 
for a dental practice, you would probably include the logo, name, hours of 
operation, phone number, and address in each ad. In these instances you can 
create Snippets, bits of information that you have saved and organized for placing 
into a new document at a later date. Snippets allow you to store those frequently 
used items in one convenient folder, organized by job number or client. In 
this chapter, the newsletter snippets are found in their own Snippets folder in 
the 08 Healthy Pets Newsletter folder. You will find this folder in 08 Artwork 
and Resources on the accompanying CD. Before we begin placing snippets, 
we’ll change our InDesign preferences to make the process much easier.
1. 
Open InDesign 
preferences by using 
Command+K (Mac) 
or Ctrl+K (Windows). 
Select File Handling from 
the left pane. Under 
Snippet Import, choose 
Original Location. Now, 
when you place each 
snippets, it will move 
to its original position 
on the newsletter. This 
preference option is important to know about for those times when 
elements must be placed in the same location on each new document.

Your document should still be open. Double-click the Front Cover page icon 
on the Pages panel. Use the Place command to select FC Nameplate. idms. 
Click anywhere on the Front Cover—since we changed InDesign’s 
preferences, the nameplate snippet will drop into the correct position.
3. 
Next, using Visual 8–7 as a guide, Place FC Open House. idms, FC Quote. idms, and

Using the Eyedropper Tool
InDesign provides many methods for formatting type. The method you have used 
thus far is to select text, frame by frame, and manually enter all the character and 
paragraph settings. The Eyedropper tool saves time by allowing you to transfer 
type attributes from one paragraph to another. On Page 2 of the newsletter, the 
copy under Dr. Heidi’s photo is formatted perfectly. You will use the Eyedropper 
tool to transfer those correct type attributes to text in another text frame.
1. 
Double-click the Eyedropper tool 
to open the Eyedropper Options
dialog box. Here, a whole array of 
options allows you to customize 
exactly which types of objects 
and their attributes, the tool 
should copy. Deselect all choices 
except Character and Paragraph Settings (Visual 8–9) and press Return.
2. 
The Eyedropper cursor icon begins white, which means 
that no attributes have been copied or “loaded” into 
the tool. Click the empty Eyedropper on the italic copy 
under Dr. Heidi’s photo. The Eyedropper now turns 
black and reverses direction as it “loads” the attributes, 
a process called sampling 
(Visual 8–10). Drag the loaded 
Eyedropper tool over the copy 
underneath Dr. Mike’s photo. As 
soon as the mouse is released, 
the text will be changed to the 
“sampled” attributes (Visual 8–10). 
As long as the Eyedropper tool is 
loaded, you can drag and highlight text with it. Holding down the Option (Mac) 
or Alt (Windows) key temporarily turns the Eyedropper white again, so you can 
resample different text attributes. Deactivate the Eyedropper by selecting another tool.

▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
Defining Styles
The Eyedropper tool is ideal for formatting small quantities of text. When working 
on larger documents, it is better to use styles. This involves creating a separate 
style for each text element by defining all its various attributes. For instance, you 
would define a style used for headlines, one for body copy, another for photo 
captions, and so on. Once you have defined the styles, they can be consistently 
applied to text on any of the pages in your document. This is the fastest, most 
accurate (and most fun) method of formatting large amounts of text.
The Links Panel–No link problems.
The Links Panel
Link problems displayed in status column
When you place an image into InDesign, you are 
creating a link. No data from the placed artwork 
file is actually brought into the InDesign document. 
Instead, a link, or pathway, is created from the 
original artwork file to the InDesign document. 
When your document is printed, InDesign follows 
the link’s path back to the original image file, reads 
the data, and prints the image. When InDesign can’t 
find the link, it can’t accurately render the image.
When a warning appears that a link is missing, your 
first course of action is to open the Links panel: 
Shift+Cmd+D (Mac) or Shift+Control+D (Windows).
The right column shows the page where each image 
in the document is used. The left column shows the 
status of each link. A yellow triangle means that the 
original file has changed and the link needs updating. 
To update a link, select the file name and choose 
Update Link at the bottom of the Links panel.
A white question mark in a red circle means the path 
to the original image is broken. To repair a broken link, 
click on the problem link, and select the Relink button 
at the bottom of the panel. For this project, navigate 
to the 08 Healthy Pets Newsletter folder and, inside, to 
the Links folder. Select the file name for each missing 
link. (Chapter 13 will have more on the Links panel.)

Styles that apply attributes to entire paragraphs are called paragraph styles. A 
paragraph can have only one paragraph style assigned to it. Every new document 
you create comes with a basic paragraph style that is applied to all the text you 
type. This style default can be edited, but it cannot be deleted. Styles that affect 
characters or words within paragraphs are called character styles. More than one 
character style can be applied to text with a paragraph style already applied. A 
character style would be used, for instance, to create a raised cap at the beginning 
of a paragraph with a different type style than the rest of the paragraph text. This 
newsletter project will focus on the following eight style management techniques:
1. Creating styles from sample text
2. Transferring styles from another InDesign document
3. Creating styles based on other styles
4. Creating a new style
5. Duplicating existing styles
6. Bringing in styles with a new element
7. Creating character styles
8. Redefining existing styles
Here’s an example of the power of using styles. Imagine that you have 
just created a 24-page annual report. When you showed your first proof 
to the client, she insisted you change the typeface of all the body text. No 
problem. Because you defined and applied styles to all the text when you 
created the document, all you need to do is to change the font attributes 
of the body copy style and all the text will automatically update.
1. Creating Styles from Sample Text
Let’s create paragraph styles for 
your newsletter project. Open the 
Paragraph Styles panel by pressing 
Cmd+F11 (Mac) or F11 (Windows), 
or by choosing Window>Styles. The 
first thing you notice is that the panel 
has only one entry: [Basic Paragraph], 
the default paragraph style for the 
document. No other styles have been 
defined. In the lower right you’ll 
see the Create new style and Delete 
selected style/groups buttons. You may 
remember using similar buttons in 
the Layers panel. In InDesign, all the 
panels work in basically the same way.

The first method of defining a style is to copy the attributes from existing copy.
1. 
Move to the Back Cover by clicking on the Page 1 
icon on the Pages panel. Place the snippet 
named BC Grooming. idms (Visual 8–12).
2. 
Open the Paragraph Styles panel. Place the 
blinking text cursor in the headline, Grooming, and 
Option+click (Mac) or Alt+click (Windows) on the 
Create new style icon on the bottom of the panel.
In the New Paragraph Style dialog box, the Style Name field remains Paragraph 
Style 1 until you rename it. In Visual 8–13, the style has been named Headline. 
Based On is an important field you will want to watch each time you create a 
style. There is a Shortcut field where you can assign a keyboard shortcut to apply 
this style to other text, once the style has been defined. Create a shortcut key 
using a number in the number pad in conjunction with one or more modifier 
keys. For Mac users, modifier keys are Shift, Option, and Command. In Windows, 
Num Lock must first be turned on, then use Shift, Alt, and Control, plus a number 
from the number pad to create a keyboard shortcut. For example, Visual 8–13 
shows Shift+Num 1 for the shortcut for Headline. (A numeric keypad is ideal 
for using Style shortcuts. However, if you are working on a laptop, it’s easier to 
select the desired style in the Styles panel or use the Styles pull-down options 
in the Paragraph and Character control panel. We’ll cover that, later.) The Style 
Settings field displays a summary of all the paragraph settings used in the style.

|  Chapter 8 |
3. 
Name this style Headline, assign Shift+Num 1 as the shortcut, and select 
Apply Style to Selection. When you check this option, the text you used to 
define a style is assigned the style you have just created. Click OK. This method 
of defining a style is accurate and automatic, and you didn’t have to enter a 
single formatting option! (The Headline style is first specified in italic, and will 
be redefined to a Roman face in the last step of this newsletter project.)
4. 
Place the text cursor in the copy below the headline. Using the method 
described in Steps 2 and 3, create a new style named Body Copy with 
a keyboard shortcut of Shift+Num 2. Save your document.
2. Transferring Styles from Another InDesign Document
Let’s say you are showing a new client various newsletter samples you have 
designed. The client finds a sample she likes and says, “I wish my newsletter could 
look just like this.” The next method of creating paragraph and character styles 
will transfer the styles from another InDesign document. Here’s how it’s done:
1. 
Click on the panel menu in the Paragraph Styles panel and choose Load Paragraph 
Styles. In the 08 Healthy Pets Newsletter folder, select the Healthy Pets.indt file. Click 
Open. The Load Styles dialog box, shown in Visual 8–14, gives you the opportunity 
to select which styles you want to load. For our purposes, make sure all the styles 
are checked. When you press Return, the styles will load into your document.
2. 
Your Paragraph Styles panel should now look 
like Visual 8–15. Notice that not all the styles 
have shortcut keys. Shortcut keys are not usually 
assigned to styles that are used infrequently.

3. Creating Styles Based on Other Styles
There are times when you will need a variation of a particular style within a 
document. For example, perhaps you have created a style named Body Copy that 
works for the main portion of the text. You also have some paragraphs of body 
text that need a custom left indent. A variation of the Body Copy style, called 
Body Copy Indent (which includes a left indent), could be created. Body Copy 
Indent is based on Body Copy, and these two styles share a parent-child relationship 
with many similar attributes. When changes are made to attributes of the parent 
style (Body Copy), those shared attributes are changed in the child—Body Copy 
Indent. Here’s how simple it is to create a new style, based on an existing one.
1. 
Option+click or Alt+click the Create new style icon in the Paragraph Styles 
panel. In the New Paragraph Style dialog box, name the style Body Copy 
Indent. Since styles are listed alphabetically, it’s a good idea to name related 
styles similarly. Body Copy Indent will appear after Body Copy in the style list.
2. 
At the left side is a list of formatting categories. You can tell you are 
in the General category because it is highlighted. In the Based On 
field in the center of the dialog box, choose Body Copy.
3. 
Open each of the categories in the list. As you read each category page, you will 
realize that with few exceptions, the text formatting features listed are ones you 
are already familiar with, and you have accessed them through regular panels.
4. 
Open the Indents and Spacing category page. Set a left indent of 0.125" (Visual 8–16) 
and press Return. This new style looks just like the Body Copy style, except it has a 
different left indent. And because Body Copy Indent is based on Body Copy, any 
changes you make to the Body Copy style will be automatically made to this style.
When you are creating a style based on another style and need 
to reset the “child” style back to the style it is based on, click the 
Reset to Base button on the General page of the panel.
VISUAL |8–16 |
The Body Copy Indent style

|  Chapter 8 |
4. Creating a New Style
Next we’ll create a new style named Kicker. A kicker is a short line of type 
that appears above a headline. Kickers can tease your reader into the 
article and add interest to an otherwise boring headline. On the front page 
of the newsletter you’ll see a kicker above the headline describing new 
equipment. New equipment might not interest pet owners, but the benefit 
of new equipment does! Hence, the Great News for Pet Owners kicker.
1. 
Open the New Paragraph Style dialog box and set these text parameters 
for the new style you will name Kicker. Look at the Based On field 
to verify that [Basic Paragraph] is selected. Basic Character Formats: 
Adobe Garamond Pro Italic 14, leading: auto (16.8 pt.).
2. 
Choose Indents and Spacing page and set Space After to 0.0625".
Choose Paragraph Rules page and turn Rule Below on. Set Weight: 0.5 pt.,
Color: Black, Offset: 0.0766", Width: Text. Press Return. Save your document.
5. Duplicating Existing Styles
We are going to create a new style called Health Focus Standing Head. Since this 
style is so similar to the Kicker style, we will create it by duplicating and editing 
the Kicker style. Standing heads are titles for features that appear in each issue. For 
instance, in a newspaper, the obituaries, sports, editorials, and classifieds each 
have their own title design that readers recognize and look for. Standing heads are 
used over and over, while a kicker is used once with one specific headline. Our 
newsletter project includes a Health Focus article with each issue. The standing 
head is found at the top left column on page 2: This Issue’s Health Focus.
1. 
Select the Kicker paragraph style. Click on the menu options of the Paragraph 
Styles panel and choose Duplicate Style. In the Duplicate Paragraph 
Style dialog box, rename the style to Health Focus Standing Head. In 
the Based On field, choose [No Paragraph Style] (Visual 8–17).
2. 
Choose the Basic Character Formats page, change the typeface to
Adobe Garamond Pro Bold Italic. Press Return. Save your document.
VISUAL |8–17 |
Although the Health Focus 
Standing Head style was 
duplicated from the Kicker 
style, it is not based on it. This 
style retains many of the Kicker 
attributes, but it will remain 
independent of any changes 
made to the Kicker style.

6. Bringing in Styles with a New Element
When an element that has been formatted with a style is copied and then pasted 
into another InDesign document, the element and its style will be transferred 
to the current document. Here’s an example of how easily this can be done.
1. 
Go to the Page 2 and 3 spread. From the snippet folder, place 
P2  Spread Head.idms on Page 2 and P3 Spread Head.idms on Page 3.
2. 
You will notice that a new paragraph style has appeared: Spread Headline. When you 
place a snippet that has a paragraph or character style applied, that style is added to 
the list of styles. Place your text cursor in the spread head on Page 3. You will notice 
that a plus (+) sign appears after the name of the applied style. A plus (+) sign indicates 
a style override, which means that something was added to the text that was not 
included in the defined style. You can see a description of the override by holding 
your mouse over the style displaying the plus (+) sign. A description of the additional 
formatting appears in parentheses. In this case, you will want to keep the style override. 
However, if you wanted to delete the paragraph style override, you would press Option 
(Mac) or Alt (Windows) as you clicked the style name in the list. For our newsletter, 
the Spread Headline style was originally created with right alignment. The spread 
headline on page 3 is left aligned, flush to the inside margin, which is a style override.
Creating a New Style Group
Before we move on to Character styles, we will organize our paragraph styles 
by creating a folder to hold all the Health Focus styles. From the Paragraph 
Styles menu, choose New Style Group. Name the group Health Focus
(Visual 8–18). Select each Health Focus style and drop it into the folder. Your 
paragraph styles should match Visual 8–18. If the styles are shown in a 
different order, you can choose Sort by Name from the panel options.

7. Creating Character Styles
Open the Character Styles panel by pressing Shift+Command+F11 (Mac) or 
Shift+F11 (Windows), or by choosing Window>Styles>Character Styles. You 
will notice that a character style already appears in the panel. It was loaded with 
the paragraph styles we transferred from a document earlier. We have one more 
character style to create and then we’ll be ready to build the rest of the newsletter.
1. 
Option+click (Mac) or Alt+click (Windows) the Create new style button at 
the bottom of the Character Styles panel. Specify Based on: [None]. Name 
the style Body Copy Bold. Assign a keyboard shortcut: Shift+Num 5.
2. 
On the Basic Character Formats page, enter Myriad 
Pro Bold 10/11. Save your document.
3. 
Open the Paragraph Styles and Character Styles panels and compare them with 
the ones shown in Visual 8–19. If your list looks like Visual 8–19, you are ready 
to complete your newsletter. If some styles are missing, you will want to review 
this section to find the steps that were skipped. Now let’s finish this job.
Applying Styles
Paragraph and Character styles can be applied using several methods. Try each 
of the following four methods, and then use the ones that work best for you.
Apply Styles from the Paragraph or Character Styles
The first method of applying a style is to open the Paragraph or Character 
styles panel, select the copy, and then click on the name of the style in the 
panel. When you are applying a Paragraph style, you don’t need to highlight 
all the copy in the paragraph. Place your cursor in the paragraph, and the 
style will apply to the entire paragraph. When you apply a Character style, 
you need to highlight all the copy that the style should be applied to.

Apply Styles by Using Keyboard Shortcuts
The second method of applying styles is to select the copy and press the 
keyboard shortcut assigned to the style. It is unlikely that all styles will 
have keyboard shortcuts, so you will probably use keyboard shortcuts 
only for styles you will assign quite often, like body copy.
Apply Styles from the Control Panel
A third method of applying styles is to select the styles from 
the Control panel. Visual 8–20 shows where the Styles choices 
appear on the Character and Paragraph Controls.
Apply Styles Using Quick Apply
A fourth method of applying styles is to use Quick Apply. When your 
document contains a long list of styles, Quick Apply allows you to locate a 
style by typing part of the style name. Press the up and down arrow keys to 
scroll through the list of items. To apply a style, press Enter or Return. To close 
Quick Apply without applying an item, press Esc or click on the document.
You have prepared the document structure, brought in images from Snippets, 
and created styles for typographic consistency and production speed. Let’s 
see how well they work. We’ll begin on the front cover. You should print 
out the actual size newsletter sample from the 08 Healthy Pets Newsletter 
folder on the CD because it shows where all the styles are used.

▶  It’s faster to drag a text frame while you 
are placing text than to create a frame 
first and then drop text into it.
▶   Placed text will come in with the attributes of 
the style that is highlighted in the panel window. 
When you place text, be sure you do not have a 
character style highlighted in the Character styles 
window. In this newsletter project, for instance, 
the last style you created was a character style 
and it is probably still highlighted. By default, a 
paragraph style won’t replace a character style. 
So, before you begin to place text, select [None] 
in the Character Style field in the Control panel.
▶  A good rule of thumb is to select all the text and 
first change the style to Body Copy. This technique 
generally reduces the point size of your text and 
makes a large text block more manageable. When 
the text frame is active and you are in the Type tool, 
press Command+A (Mac) or Control+A (Windows) 
to select all the type. It is important to select only 
text in a frame and not all the objects on your 
page! Then apply the Body Copy paragraph style.
Another way to accomplish this step is to have 
the Body Copy style selected when you place 
the text so that it will automatically appear 
with the Body Copy style. After the Body Copy 
style is assigned to the text block, you may 
apply the subheads and character styles.
▶  Press Enter (Mac) or Enter on the Number 
pad (Windows) to make text jump from 
one linked text frame to the next.
 ▶  Paragraph and Character styles can also be 
accessed through the Control panel. Choose the 
Paragraph or Character formatting options.
▶  A plus (+) sign following a defined style in the 
Paragraph Styles panel means additional formatting 
has been added. To remove Paragraph and local 
formatting overrides, click the Clear Overrides icon 
on the Styles panel (Visual 8–11), or choose Clear 
Overrides from the Paragraph Styles panel options.
 ▶  Clearing overrides does not remove formatting 
created by Character styles. To remove Character 
styles, select text containing the Character style and 
then click [None] in the Character Styles panel.
▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
Applying Styles to the Front Cover
1. 
Check the Control panel to see that Character styles are set to [None] and Paragraph 
styles are set to Body Copy. Create a 2-column text frame in the first column 
that begins under the photo and extends across the second column, and to the 
bottom margin, gutter 0.1875". Place the New equipment increases.docx file from 
the 08 Healthy Pets Newsletter folder on the CD accompanying this book.
2. 
If the copy is not already Body Copy, select all the type and apply 
the Body Copy paragraph style by pressing Shift+Num 2.

A pull quote is an excerpt that is designed to stand out from the rest of the 
body copy. Pull quotes add visual interest and encourage readership. Place 
snippet FC Pull Quote.idms and position it between the two columns. Adjust 
its position for the best text flow. Text wrap options have already been turned 
on. Make sure the paragraph beginning with The video endoscope, is at the 
top of the second column, and not at the bottom of the first column.

Applying Styles to Pages 2 and 3
The spread for pages 2 and 3 should have a horizontal guideline 
stretching across the whole spread at the 1.65" Y-coordinate position. 
Articles on the top of this spread should butt up to this guide.
1. 
Find the Feeding.docx article from the 08 Healthy Pets Newsletter folder. 
Place the text, dragging a text frame in the third column of Page 2, 
from the top guideline down to the top of Dr. Mike’s photo.
2. 
Apply the Body Copy and Headline styles to this article. Notice there are many instances 
in this article where you will need to change the register mark (later in this project).
3. 
Refer to Visual 8–26 or the newsletter sample printed earlier, to place 
the rest of the articles on spread 2–3. The Spay or Neuter.docx article 
on Page 3 continues in a linked frame under the photo. Bottom align 
both columns of the Spay article so that the text lines up.
4. 
Dental Care.docx, in the third column of Page 3, is in a text frame 
that reaches across two columns. Save your document.
Creating the Health Focus Table
Hopefully you remember the table functions you learned earlier. If 
not, you will need to review that section in Chapter 5.
1. 
The Health Focus is the last feature on Page 2. Draw a frame that stretches 
across the first and second columns and extends down to the bottom margin. 
Use Command+B (Mac) or Control+B (Windows) to apply a 0.125" text 
inset on all sides. Fill the frame with 10% Blue. Place Vaccines Critical to 
your.docx, found in the 08 Healthy Pets Newsletter folder, in the frame.
2. 
First, change all copy to Health Focus Body Copy. Then, apply the Health 
Focus Standing Head and Health Focus Headline styles. The italic type under 
the headline is called a deck. A deck is designed to increase reading interest. 
It usually summarizes the accompanying article and appears between the 
headline and the body copy. Apply the Health Focus Deck style to the deck.
3. 
Highlight the text from just before the words 8 weeks to the word Optional. Use the 
Paragraph Options Control to remove the left indent on the selected text. Choose 
Table>Convert Text to Table; Column Separator: Tab; Row Separator: Paragraph. You will 
need to format the table. The copy is Myriad Pro Regular 10/11. Center text in cells,

Finishing Page 4
All the text files needed for page 4 are found in the 08 Healthy Pets Newsletter folder. 
Place Pet ID.docx at the bottom of the third column. You will need to do some local 
formatting in this article by changing the Home Again product name to italics. Notice 
that when you add local formatting, a plus sign (+) appears at the end of the Body 
Copy paragraph style in the panel. Place and apply styles to the Heartworm. docx
and Toys.docx files. Place the Emergency Vet Service.docx file, formatting the type 
as shown in the newsletter sample printed from the PDF file on your CD. Notice 
that the Fleas and Ticks.docx article uses two paragraph styles: Body Copy, Body 
Copy Indent; and a character style, Body Copy Bold, which will be applied next.
Applying Character Styles
If you find yourself doing the same type of local formatting over and 
over again, it’s probably time to define and apply a character style. The 
last page has two articles that use the Body Copy Bold character style: 
Fleas and Ticks and Corrections to keep your puppy from biting.
1. 
In the Fleas and Ticks article, use the Body Copy Bold character style on the product 
names in the bulleted copy: Frontline®, Flea-tick Spray, Flea Shampoo, Flea Collar, 
Preventic®, and House Spray. Highlight those words and apply the Body Copy Bold 
character style from the 
Character Styles panel, 
using the keyboard 
shortcut created earlier. Be 
sure to use Indent to here
to hang the second line 
of copy under bullets.
2.  In the Corrections 
article, apply the Body 
Copy Bold character 
style to these words: 
OUCH!, Substitute, 
and Lip Pinch.

8. Redefining Styles
The newsletter is almost finished. This is a great time to print a copy, look at 
it carefully, and fine-tune the positioning of all the elements. Check for the 
correct use of hyphens and dashes. As you can see, your newsletter looks great, 
except the headlines are all italic, and the newsletter sample shows them as 
roman. If you hadn’t defined and applied styles, you would need to manually 
change every headline in the document. That may not be a big deal for a short 
4-page newsletter, but imagine making that change in a 64-page book!
1. 
Highlight one paragraph with the Headline style assigned. Change the typeface to
Myriad Pro Bold Condensed.
2. 
Open the Paragraph Styles panel. Since you made a type style change on the local 
level, you will see a plus sign (+) next to the Headline style. Open the panel menu 
options and choose Redefine Style. The Headline style is now updated to reflect the 
Roman type style throughout the whole document! Save and print your newsletter.
Clearing Overrides
Sections of type that have a paragraph style, plus overrides, are easy to identify. When 
these passages are selected, a plus sign (+) is displayed at the end of the style name 
in the panel. To remove Paragraph and local Character formatting overrides, click 
the Clear Overrides icon on the Paragraph Control panel 
or choose Clear overrides in selection from the Paragraph 
panel options. You have other choices for clearing overrides:
▶Click on the style name in the style panel
(no Option or Alt) to clear Paragraph overrides only.
▶Cmd+click (Mac) or Ctrl+click (Windows) on the Clear overrides 
in selection icon to clear local Character formatting only.
▶To remove Character style formatting, select the text and choose 
[None] in the Styles field of the Character Control panel.

Using Find/Change
Find/Change allows you to search for specific words, characters, digits, or keystrokes 
and replace them with something you specify. The Find/Change dialog box is 
filled with choices—and it is worthwhile to spend some time looking at the 
options available in the fields. Use the keyboard shortcut or choose Edit>Find/
Change and type (r) in the Find what field. In the Change to field, select the 
Special characters for replace menu (the @ sign), then choose Symbols>Registered 
Trademark Symbol. Set the Search field to Document and press the Change All 
button. Every occurrence of (r) in the entire newsletter will change to ®

Printing Your Newsletter
Your newsletter is now completed. Proof it one more time. If you have access 
to a printer that can handle 11" × 17" paper, select Spreads in the General 
window of the Print dialog box. Then choose Tabloid or 11" × 17" under 
Setup, and change the orientation so that your pages print side by side. If 
you wish to print your newsletter in spreads on letter-size paper, select 
Spreads under General, and then Scale to Fit under Setup (Visual 8–30).
Summary
Good designers use techniques to make disinterested readers take a longer look 
at a publication. This newsletter project introduced you to some publication design 
elements: pull quote, deck, standing head, and kicker. These elements, when 
combined with appropriate typeface selection, line measure, and leading, create a 
document that has contrast and wonderful texture.
When working on complex projects, it is important to remember that there are 
no “throwaway” elements. The position and style of a page number or a pull quote 
should not be overlooked just because it’s small or used only once or twice. All 
elements are important, and should work together to create gestalt—where the 
whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It takes creative energy and commitment 
to refine the smallest details of a document. But this ability to maintain a high level 
of focus is what separates the skilled designers from the masses.

introduction
Page consistency is critical for multiple-page documents. A five-person team producing a 96-page 
catalog needs a document structure that is consistent from page to page and designer to designer. 
Perhaps you’ve leafed through a publication where repeating elements, like page numbers, appear 
to jump around the outside corners like cartoons in an old-fashioned flip book. This would be an 
indication that the production team was not working with a clearly defined document structure. 
Master pages and object styles are ideal for bringing organization and consistency to complex 
documents. Items placed on master pages appear in the exact same location on every document 
page. Object styles can be used to define the stroke on a photo frame or a colored background in a 
text area. Changes made to a master page or an object style will ripple through the entire document, 
which saves time and reduces the margin of error. Proper document construction can make or break 
the finished project. Take the time to plan your projects thoughtfully before starting them.

The Pages Panel
You’ve already used the Pages panel as you’ve worked through this text, but you’ve 
never been “formally introduced” to this little dynamo. The Pages panel can be 
opened by clicking on the Pages icon on the dock or by using keyboard shortcuts. 
If you are a Windows user, simply press F12 (function key) and the panel will 
open up. If you are a Mac user, function key F12 might already be assigned to a 
operating system operation such as Exposé. If that is the case, you must add the 
Command key to F12 to open the Pages panel. And if you are a laptop user, you’re 
probably already aware that, depending on the configuration of your keyboard, you 
may need to press the fn key along with the number to activate the Pages panel.
What are Master Pages?
The most basic functions of the Pages 
panel are to add, delete, duplicate, and 
rearrange pages in your document. 
But the Pages panel also allows you 
to create master pages. A master page 
is a page layout that is created on one 
spread or page and then applied to 
single or a range of document pages. For 
instance, if I want my name to appear 
in the lower right corner of each page 
in a document, I can make a master 
page and place my name in the perfect 
location, typestyle and size. When I apply this master page to the document 
pages, my name will automatically appear in the exact location on each page!
As you begin working with complex documents, you will realize that individual 
pages have different layout requirements. In a single document, for instance, some 
pages may require three text columns, and other pages may need four. Margins may 
vary from page to page. Some pages may require folios (page numbers), running 
heads, or footers. Or, a graphic element may appear only on recto (right-hand) 
pages with four columns and a footer! Using the Pages panel, you can create master 
pages that have different margins and columns, or contain repeating elements, 
such as folios. Different master pages may be assigned to individual document 
pages. Each document page takes on the attributes of the master page assigned 
to it. Now that you know how master pages are used, you can understand how 
they bring consistency and assist with the production of complex documents.

A-Master: The Document Default
Each time a new document is created, the specified margins and columns are 
assigned to a default master page named A-Master. A document’s A-Master is 
the basic layout that automatically applies to all pages in the document. You 
can change margins and columns on a single page, but the remaining pages 
will still retain the attributes of the A-Master default. But if you use the Pages 
panel to change the margins and columns on the A-Master, the document 
default, then those changes will be applied to all the pages in a document.
Basic Operations
Page masters are viewed in the Pages panel. By default, the master pages 
are displayed in the upper portion of the Pages panel and the regular 
document pages are shown in the lower (Visual 9–1). For the next series 
of exercises, we will be using 09 Master Pages.indd from the 09 Artwork 
and Resources folder, found on the CD accompanying this text.
1. 
Modify Pages Panel Options. Open 09 Master Pages.indd. Press Command+F12 
(Mac) or F12 (Windows) to open the Pages panel. This five-page document has 
been created with a photo on the master page. As you look at the page icons in the 
Pages panel, you can see that the master item—the photo—is repeated on each 
page. On the Pages panel option menu, choose Panel Options to open a dialog that 
allows you to change the size and layout of the various page icons in the Pages
panel. In Visual 9–1, notice that the size of the document page icons has been 
changed to Extra Large, and the Show Vertically option has been deselected.
2. 
Move from master level to document level. Double-click on the page 1 icon, 
below the double line on the Pages panel. The page is highlighted, and the number 
below the page is in a black box. You are now on document page 1, on the local, 
or document level. Double-click on A-Master in the top section of the panel. The 
master becomes highlighted, and you are now on the A-Master page, on the global,

or master level. Repeat this sequence until you are comfortable moving between the 
two levels. Notice the page number in the lower left corner of the InDesign window. 
It shows the active page, and switches between A-Master and page 1 as you move 
back and forth. When you single-click a page or master page, the page becomes 
highlighted, but the page is not actually selected. A single-click highlights a page; 
and a double-click moves to, and displays the page. Double-click on different pages 
in your document, and watch the numbers change in the page number field.
3. 
Apply the [None] master. Select the master page named [None] from the 
Pages panel. Drag the [None] page icon to the document level, and place it on 
top of page 2. Release the mouse when a thick, black border appears around the 
page 2 icon. The [None] master unassigns a master from a page. In this example, 
A-Master is now removed from page 2, and is replaced by a blank page. Use 
the [None] master to unassign A-Master from pages 2–5 in your document.
4. 
Rename a master page. Double-click 
A-Master. Draw two lines below the 
photo. For the top line, specify width 
10-pt., Red stroke. Lower line, width 
3-pt., Blue stroke. Open the Master 
Options dialog box from the Pages 
menu. In this dialog box you can set 
various options, such as the Prefix 
that will be displayed on page icons 
to identify which master page has 
been applied. You can also rename 
the master page. Type Red & Blue 
Lines in the Name field (Visual 9–3).

Insert pages. There are many methods of inserting pages in a document. Insert 
additional pages to your document, using each of the following methods:
 
▶Click on the Pages panel options and choose Insert Pages. In the Insert Pages 
dialog box you can specify how many pages to add, and which master should 
be assigned to the new pages. In Insert Pages, change the Pages field to 1. 
Check that the Insert fields are set to After Page and 1. Select A-Red & Blue 
Lines in the Master field. Press Return. Compare the pages assigned to A-Red 
& Blue Lines with the unassigned, blank pages. Notice that the assigned pages 
have a small A on the top of each page icon. This tells you, at a glance, that 
the A-Red & Blue Lines master page is applied to those document pages.
 
▶Click the Create new page icon at the bottom of the Pages panel (Visual 9–1). 
Each time you click, a new page is inserted after the page you are on. The 
new pages are assigned the master page used for the last page you were on. 
If you press Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) as you click the Create new page 
icon, the same Insert Pages dialog box, found on the Pages panel, opens.
 
▶ Go to File>Document Setup and enter a value in Number of Pages.  
When you insert pages using this technique, you don’t have the 
option to choose which master page the new pages will be based on, 
and new pages are always added to the end of the document.
 
▶ You can also insert a document page that is based on a master by dragging and 
dropping the master page icon into the document section of the Pages panel. If 
you want to add the new page in a particular spot, say between pages 1 and 2, 
drag the master page between the two page icons until you see a vertical line 
appear after page 1. When you release the mouse, there will be a new page 2 
created; the old page 2 will be shifted to the number 3 spot. Be careful not to 
release the mouse when the border of a document page is highlighted. If you 
do, you will be applying that master page to the selected document page.
Understand the following visual cues when using the Pages panel. When pages are added by pulling 
masters to the document level, a thin vertical line indicates an insertion point between pages. A black 
frame surrounding a page means that the selected master is being applied to the document page.

Delete pages. There are also several methods for deleting pages. Use each 
of the following methods to delete pages in your document, until your 
document has only one page and keep your file open for more practice.
▶Select a page and drag it to the Delete selected pages icon 
(Visual 9–1). Or, Shift+click to select a range of pages, 
and drag them to the Delete selected pages icon.
▶Select a page, or range of pages, and click the Delete selected pages icon.
▶Select a page, or range of pages. Go to the Pages 
options and choose Delete Spread.
▶Go to Layout>Pages>Delete Pages and specify the page that will be deleted.
▶ Go to File>Document Setup and change the value in Number of Pages. 
This method removes pages from the end of the document.
Modifying Master Items on the Document Level
Using master pages is ideal when you have a document with elements such as folios 
(page numbers), headers, footers, or design elements that will appear on every page. 
When you apply a master to a document page, all the elements from the master, called 
master items, appear in the same position on each document page. Text frames created 
on the master page are displayed on document pages with dotted bounding boxes. 
Even though you may have created multiple master pages to cover every possible 
page layout scenario, there are times when master items still need to be modified on 
the document level. Before a master item can be modified on the document level, 
it must be overridden. This is a keyboard shortcut that you will frequently use—
Shift+Command+Click (Mac) or Shift+Control+Click (Windows). Carefully 
work through the next series of exercises to learn how to manage master items.
1. 
Override master items. When you override a master item, a copy of the item 
appears on the document page, allowing you to change its attributes. Press 
Shift+Command (Mac) or Shift+Control (Windows) and click on the red line on 
page 1. Handles appear, indicating that the line is editable. Change the red line’s 
stroke to Yellow. A master item that is overridden still retains its association with 
the master page. However, the attributes that were changed on the local level 
won’t be updated when those same attributes are changed on the master page. 
In the example of our red-turned-to-yellow line, color was the attribute changed 
on the local level. When the master page is modified, InDesign will update only 
attributes that have not been modified on the local level. Go to master A-Red 
& Blue Lines. Move the red line to the bottom of the master page, and change 
its stroke to Green. On page 1, notice that the position of the line changed, but 
not the stroke color, because the color had been modified on the local level.

2. 
Allow Master Item Overrides on Selection.
Go to page 1, and use the keyboard shortcut 
to override the photo. Nothing happens. This 
element cannot be modified because when it 
was placed on the master, Allow Master Item 
Overrides on Selection was turned off in the 
Pages panel menu. Select the photo on A-Red & 
Blue Lines master page. Under the panel options, 
select Allow Master Item Overrides on Selection 
(Visual 9–4). Now, delete the photo on page 1.
3. 
 Remove Selected Local Overrides. Override 
the lines on page 1, and change their positions 
and stroke colors. Select one of the lines. From 
the Pages options, choose Remove Selected Local 
Overrides (Visual 9–5). With this command, the 
attributes of the selected item will be restored 
to match the item on the master page.
4. 
Remove All Local Overrides. You can also revert 
a page to the original master. In these cases, select 
Remove All Local Overrides from the Pages options 
(Visual 9–6). When you choose this option, the 
page is restored to the current master assigned 
to it. No items should be selected when choosing 
this option. If items are selected, the Pages menu 
displays Remove Selected Local Overrides, rather 
than Remove All Local Overrides. Choose Remove 
All Local Overrides for page 1, and let’s continue.
5. 
Detach Selection from Master. Go to A-Red 
& Blue Lines master and select the photo. 
Choose Allow Master Item Overrides on Selection 
from the panel options. Now, go back to 
page 1. Use Shift+Command+click (Mac) or 
Shift+Control+click (Windows) to override the 
photo. Under the Pages options, select Detach 
Selection from Master (Visual 9–7). A master item 
must be overridden before it can be detached. 
Once a master item is detached, there is no

more connection with the master page. Changes made on the master page will not 
affect items that have been detached. Go back to A-Red & Blue Lines and delete the 
photo. The photo remains on page 1, because it is no longer associated with the 
master page. Use the Undo command to replace the photo on the master page.
6. 
 Override All Master Items. Overriding every individual master item 
on a complex page can be time consuming. Override All Master Items
overrides all master items on the selected page, not on all the pages in 
a document. You will want to memorize this keyboard shortcut!
Creating A Document With Multiple Masters
Many documents require more than one master page. For instance, you may 
be working on a document that requires different pages to have a two-column 
grid, a three-column grid, and a four-column grid. In such a case, if you don’t 
create multiple master pages, you will need to change the margins and columns 
on each individual page—that’s too much work! In the next exercise you will 
create a small publication, Baseball Digest, with photography provided by baseball 
fan(atic) Kristina Hegyera, a student at Waukesha County Technical College. 
The document is partially constructed for you, and each step in the project will 
introduce a new master page function. Take your time as you systematically learn 
the features of master pages. You will need to use elements from 09 Artwork 
and Resources which are found on the CD that accompanies this text.

1. 
Open 09 Baseball Digest.indd from the 09 Artwork and Resources folder on the CD.
2. 
Rename A-Master. Open the Pages panel. Highlight the verso and recto
page of A-Master. Go to Master Options for A-Master and change the Name to 
Folio and Header, Number of Pages: 2. You’ve just renamed the master page. 
Giving descriptive names to master pages is a good production practice.
3. 
Specify automatic page numbering. Enlarge the view of the Folio and Header 
master page. In the outside, bottom corner of each spread is a letter X. This letter is a 
placeholder for a page number. You’ll replace placeholder X with InDesign’s special 
character, Current Page Number. As a result, a page number will be automatically placed 
on each document page. Highlight the X on the recto 
master page, and press Shift+Command+Option+N 
(Mac) or Shift+Control+Alt+N (Windows). Current Page 
Number can also be inserted from the Context or Type 
menus>Insert Special Character>Markers>Current 
Page Number. The X will be replaced with the 
letter, A. Letter A corresponds to the A prefix on 
this master page. Repeat this process to replace 
the verso folio X with the Current Page Number 
symbol. When you look at the pages on the local level, you will see that page 
numbers are displayed on each page. Because the folios are master items, you don’t 
need to worry that they will be accidently repositioned on a document page.

Add running heads. A running head (or header) is a line of text that appears at the 
top of every page. Navigate to the 09 Baseball Digest folder on the 09 Artwork and 
Resources folder. Change InDesign Preferences>File Handling so that the Snippet 
Import position is at the Original Location. Then on the A-Folio and Header master 
page, place X Verso Header.idms in the upper left corner of the verso master page, and 
X Recto Header.idms in the upper right corner of the recto master. This master page 
will now be used as a foundation for the rest of the master pages for this publication.
Enable Layout Adjustment
 Layout Adjustment automatically changes the position of elements when 
changes are made to an existing layout. Layout Adjustment isn’t just a feature 
of master pages—it can be used at the document level, as well. But this is an 
excellent time to learn about Layout Adjustment. Layout Adjustment works 
best with elements that are aligned to the guides of margins and page columns, 
and to ruler guides. We will change the column settings on the master level 
and let Layout Adjustment update the layout on the document level.
5. 
Go to page 1. Draw a text frame inside the margin area and fill with placeholder 
text. Now, go to Layout>Layout Adjustment. If Layout Adjustment is not listed, 
select Show All Menu Items from the bottom of the list. When the dialog box 
comes up, select Enable Layout Adjustment and accept the default settings 
(Visual 9–12). Select the recto master page. Under Layout>Margins and Columns, 
enter 3 in the Columns Number field. Go to page 1 and you will see that the 
text has been automatically updated to three columns. Undo the 3-column 
master change and delete the text frame, but keep your document open!

Creating and Duplicating Master Pages
The A-Folio and Header master page spread has single text columns, headers, and 
auto page numbering. Now you will create another master page with the same 
headers and folios, but with different margins and column guides. Before a new 
master page is created, you have a decision to make: Should this page be based on 
another master page, or should it be an independent page, based on [None]? Just 
like paragraph styles, which can be based on another style, a master page based 
on another master page, will automatically update, if any changes are made to 
the original master page. When working with master pages, the original master 
page is the parent master, and the master page based on it, is the child master.
1. 
Create a new master spread. Choose New Master from the panel options. When 
the New Master dialog box appears, type Two-column Grid in the Name field. 
In Based On Master: choose A-Folio and Header, Number of Pages: 2. A new 
master page with a B prefix will now appear in the master level of the Pages panel. 
The letter A in the upper corners shows that master A is the parent master. Select 
each page in B-Two-column Grid. Notice that the headers and footers from the 
A master were transferred to this new master page. Now, make sure both master 
page icons in the spread are selected and go to Layout>Margins and Columns and 
change the Columns Number to 2. Accept the default gutter, and press Return.
When duplicating master spreads, you also need to consider parent master 
and child master relationships. If you duplicate a master page and base it 
on [None], the new page will include all the elements from the copied page, 
but the connection with those elements will be broken. This means that any 
changes made on the original page will not affect the duplicate page.
2. 
Duplicate a master spread. Practice each of these methods to duplicate a master 
spread in a document:
▶
▶ Highlight the master spread and drag it to the Create new page icon
at the bottom of the Pages panel.
▶
▶Go to the Pages options menu and select Duplicate Master Spread.
▶
▶Use one of these methods to duplicate the A or B master page 
in your document. After you get comfortable using each method 
of creating duplicate master spreads, delete any you have made, 
because they will not be used in the Baseball Digest project.
3. 
Create and apply a new master spread. Choose New Master from the panel options. 
Name the master Three-column Grid, and base it on A-Folio and Header. Go to 
Layout>Margins and Columns and change the Columns Number to 3. Apply this master 
to page 1 of the document by dragging a recto Three-column Grid master page on top 
of page 1. When the black border surrounds the page, release the mouse. Override, and 
delete the header and the folio on page 1, leaving just the three column text frame.
▶ production tip
Like paragraph styles, which 
can be based on another 
style, a master page based 
on another master page, 
will automatically update, 
if any changes are made to 
the original master page.

Jump Lines and Continuation Lines
Jump lines are used to alert readers when an article is continued on a later page. 
They appear at the end of a column and read something like: “this article continues 
on page 257.” When you turn to page 257, you are greeted with a continuation 
line, which reads something like: “…article continued from page 1.” InDesign 
automates this process. A separate text frame is created, in which a special 
character marker is inserted. The Next Page Number marker is used for jump 
lines, while the Previous Page Number marker is used for continuation lines. There 
are two things you must remember when using jump and continuation lines:
▶The text frames on each page must be threaded; and
▶The jump or continuation line text frame must be touching the threaded frame.
The special characters, Next Page Number and Previous Page Number, can be found 
under the Context or Type menus by selecting Insert Special Character>Markers.

Add Page 3 elements. Apply a recto Three-column Grid master to page 3. Position
P3 Photo.idms across columns 1 and 2. Place P3 Little League.idms in columns 1 
and 2, flush with the bottom margin guide. Place P3 Coaches’ Corner.idms flush 
with the top margin guide of column 3. Place P3 Corner Ad.idms in the lower right 
corner of column 3. Center P3 Quote.idms in the remaining space in column 3.
2. 
Finish Page 4. Apply a Two-column Grid master to page 4. Place P4 Abbreviations.idms 
in the left column. Position P4 Top Quote.idms flush with the top margin guide of the 
second column. Place P4 Bottom Quote.idms centered at the bottom of the second 
column. Finally, place P4 Little League.idms in the remaining space in column 2.
3. 
Add jump and continuation lines. You will need to link the first half of the Little 
League article on page 3 to the second half on page 4, before you can add jump and 
continuation lines. Click on the out port at the bottom of the article on page 3 and then 
click on the Little League article in the second column of page 4. Move to page 3, and 
place P3 Jump Line on the bottom of column 2, on top of the article. Magnify your view. 
Place the cursor after the word page and add a space. Go to the Type menu and select 
Insert Special Character>Markers>Next Page Number (Visual 9–15). A 4 should appear

Using Object Libraries
When you do a lot of design work for a single client, you usually have elements that 
are used over and over again. For instance, if you did weekly advertisements for a 
dental practice, you would probably include the logo, name, hours of operation, 
phone number, and address in each ad. In these instances you can create an object 
library that allows you to store those frequently used items in one convenient 
location. Library objects can be dragged directly from the Library to the document. 
When you drag an element in from the library, you’re not really taking it “out” of 
the library. You’re just “borrowing” a copy to use in your document. The library 
still has the original, and will let you “check out” an unlimited number of copies.
The library you will make in the next few steps will be saved and 
used in one of the project exercises, at the end of this chapter.
1. 
From the CD that accompanies this book, open 09A Zaffinni Artwork.indd, 
found in the 09A Zaffinni folder. This InDesign file contains the source artwork 
you will use to assemble your library file.
2. 
Choose File>New>Library. Name the new library file 09 Zaffinni and save it on your 
desktop. A library panel with the name 09 Zaffinni will appear in your workspace.
3. 
Using the Selection tool, drag each page item from the 09A Zaffinni Artwork 
document to the 09 Zaffinni library panel. As the element is moved to the 
library, the cursor will display a plus sign (+) sign showing that the item will 
be added to the library (Visual 9–16). Continue this process until all seven 
page items, including the green bar, are in the 09 Zaffinni library.

4. 
Double-clicking a library entry opens the Item Information dialog box. You can 
change the name and also add a description of the item, if desired (Visual 9–17). 
Your library is now complete and can be used with any document you want to 
use it with! Be sure to remember where your 09 Zaffinni library was saved, because 
it will be used again to complete the 09A Zaffinni’s menu project, at the end of 
the chapter. Close the library panel and close, but not save, the Artwork file.
Creating Object Styles
InDesign has so many features that assist us with efficiently producing complex 
projects! Paragraph and character styles ensure typographic continuity. Master 
pages bring structural consistency to a document. And now, you will learn how to 
use object styles to quickly format text frames and graphics 
objects. Like paragraph styles, object styles can clear or 
replace object specifications according to the settings 
you have defined. Like paragraph styles, you can base 
an object style on another style, creating a parent-child 
relationship. This relationship means that the parent and 
child objects will have attributes in common. Changing 
any of those shared attributes in the parent object, 
will automatically change those in the child object.
You will create object styles to use in constructing 
the Steve  Miljat brochure project at the end of the 
chapter. Creating master pages and object styles 
for this simple document will help you to see 
how they can dramatically speed up production 
when you are working on a 240-page catalog.

Defining Object Styles For the Steve Miljat Brochure
You can define an object style from an object you have already formatted, 
or you can define one from “scratch.” These methods should sound 
familiar—you created styles in Chapter 8, using similar methods.

Now, let’s make two more styles—a text frame with a green background and 
insets, and a rectangle with a light gold background. This time, we’ll create the 
styles from existing elements. First, draw a rectangle text frame. Fill it with C=61, 
M=38, Y=100, K=12. Under Text Frame Options, specify Left and Right insets of 
0.375" and Top and Bottom insets of 0.25". With the text frame selected, Opt+click
(Mac) or Alt+click (Windows) the New Object Style icon. Name the style Green 
Text Frame. Now that the style is saved, you can delete the setup frame.

Resetting Object Style Defaults
It’s easy to change a document’s default styles—so easy it’s frustrating when done 
accidently. Whenever you select an object style, with no object selected, that 
style will become the default and will be applied to all new objects you create. 
(Similar behavior applies to other document defaults, such as paragraph or 
character styles.) The good news is that it’s just as easy to change the defaults 
back to their normal settings. The key is to deselect everything and then reset 
the defaults. For instance, if you want to change the object style default back to 
[Basic Graphics Frame], simply deselect everything (Shift+Command+A or 
Shift+Control+A) and choose [Basic Graphics Frame] in the Object Styles panel.
▶
▶By default [Basic Graphics Frame] has a 1-pt. Black stroke.
You can quickly remove this by applying the style [None] to the object.
▶
▶ A rectangle drawn with the Rectangle Frame tool (F) 
by default, has the [None] style applied.
Override and Redefine Object Styles
You can modify any of the attributes of an object that has a style applied. Such a 
change is called an override. When an object has an override, a plus (+) sign appears 
in the Object Styles panel. However, only modifications of defined attributes are 
considered overrides. In the photo box object style you created earlier, changing 
the stroke to red would show as an override, because you defined the attributes 
of the stroke in the object style. If you changed the text wrap options, no plus 
sign would appear because text wrap was not defined in the object style.
To clear overrides, first select 
the object, then press the 
Clear overrides button at the 
bottom of the Object Styles 
panel, or Option+click (Mac) 
or Alt+click (Windows) on 
the style name. If you want to 
clear modifications to the non-
defined attributes of an object, 
select the object, and press the 
Clear attributes not defined 
by style button at the bottom 
of the panel (Visual 9–24).

If you decide to keep the overrides made to any object and to redefine the style to 
include those overrides, you can choose Redefine Style from the panel options. Only 
the categories you had originally included in the style definition will be updated. 
Redefining a style will not add attributes that were not part of the original definition. 
In those cases, it would be easier to create an object style from an existing object.
Duplicate, Delete, and Import Object Styles
Duplicate, or delete an object style, by first selecting the style in the panel 
and then holding down Control (Mac) or right-click (Windows) to bring up 
the Context menu. If you delete a style that has been applied to objects, you 
will be asked to specify a replacement style. You can also delete a style by 
dragging its name to the Delete selected style icon in the lower right corner 
of the panel. To import styles from another document, select Load Object 
Styles from the panel options menu. As in importing paragraph and character 
styles, you must place a check next to the styles you wish to import.
Break the Link to an Object Style
You can break the link to an object style by selecting the object and choosing 
Break Link to Style from the panel options. When you break the link, the 
object style becomes [None]+. The object’s appearance will remain the 
same, but it will not update when the original object style is modified.
Summary
In this chapter you learned to bring consistency to a 
document by creating, duplicating, and modifying master 
pages. You learned how to release, override, and detach 
master page elements on document pages. Automated 
features including page numbering, jump lines, and 
continuation lines were introduced. You created an 
object library and used the Object Styles panel. Now, 
with Paragraph, Character, and Object Styles, as well as 
Master Pages “under your belt,” you are ready to begin 
the projects for this chapter!

introduction
How many times have you read, “Wanted: Graphic Designer. Two to five years’ experience required.” 
Everyone wants someone with experience; but how will you get experience if you don’t have a job? 
Graphic design is a highly competitive field. To be considered for an entry-level position, you not 
only need a fantastic portfolio, but you must also be able to demonstrate your ability to think 
quickly and creatively, work productively, and maintain exemplary interpersonal relationships. 
Even if you get hired, you must prove yourself before you are given more responsibility.
Sometimes your new boss will begin to try out your software skills (and your attitude) by assigning 
you lower-end production jobs. Before you begin to grumble, remind yourself that everyone has to 
start somewhere. First jobs aren’t always the most glamorous. But remember that there are hundreds 
of unemployed graphic designers out there, and each of them would love to have your job! Business 
forms seem, at first glance, to be on the bottom rung of the creativity ladder. But in reality, tables 
and forms require a high degree of precision, attention to detail, and layout skills. A skilled designer 
can turn a business form into a work of art; an unskilled designer can turn it into a nightmare!

General Project Information
The initial client meeting is your opportunity to find out the details of a project. 
Knowing the correct information up front will save backtracking later on. Your 
client’s responses to each of the following questions will affect your document setup.
▶
▶ Is there an existing form? If so, what has worked or not worked with 
the current form? Or, is there a sample form the customer likes?
▶
▶ Does the form have to match or blend with any existing forms?
What kind of tone should the form convey?
▶
▶Who will be completing the form?
▶
▶How many colors will the form be printed in?
▶
▶ Will the company logo be included on the form?
Is a digital file of the logo available? What are the corporate colors?
▶
▶Is the form one- or two-sided?
▶
▶ Does it have any requirements such as a perforation, a fold, or 
an address that shows through an envelope window?
▶
▶ How will the form be printed? on separate sheets? in duplicate or triplicate?
on a photocopier, in the office?
▶
▶ How will the form be used? Will it be mailed out in a #10 envelope?
Will it be returned in a #9 envelope? Will it be a self-mailer?
▶
▶ Will it be drilled and held in a binder? Will it be padded as a tablet with tear-
off sheets? Will it be held in a clipboard? Will it be filed in a file folder?
▶
▶ Will individual completed forms be photocopied and distributed to 
team members? Will the data will be collected and tabulated?
▶
▶ What company information will be on the form? fax? e-mail? phone?
▶
▶How often is the form revised?
▶
▶Will it require sequential numbering?
▶
▶Is there any legally required wording that must be included on the form?
General Design Considerations
A form must be a positive representation of the business. If you were waiting 
for a surgical procedure and were given an old typewritten form to fill out, your 
confidence in the surgeon might begin to slip. A well-designed form is an asset 
to a business. A form should communicate professionalism, while incorporating 
the look and feel of the rest of the company’s literature. A form should be easy to 
follow—the layout should create a visual hierarchy that organizes and sequences 
the reader’s responses. The layout should clearly identify where each response 
should be placed. A form should be usable. The user should have enough vertical

business forms
TYPOGRAPHIC CONSIDERATIONS
Some typefaces are designed specifically for 
reading, and some are designed more for display 
or decoration. When selecting a typeface for 
business communications, the overall concern 
is readability. Use a typeface that is highly 
legible, one that blends with the company logo or 
corporate identity system. If the company uses a 
trendy, cursive logotype, be careful how you use it 
in business forms. Find a legible face that blends 
with the company logotype and use that in the 
business form. Consider who will be completing 
the form. Baby boomers are now wearing reading 
glasses and require a more generous point size 
than high school students. Children mastering 
penmanship need more room for writing.
When choosing typefaces for display type and 
body copy, be sure to consider the contrast 
between the two faces. A page is interesting to 
look at, and easier to read, when continuous 
body copy is broken into blocks by darker, 
higher-contrast display type. A good layout 
will use type blocks as stepping-stones to 
move the reader through the piece.
▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
Minion Pro Typeface.
Adobe Jenson Pro Typeface.
At first glance, you might not see the 
difference between these two faces. Check 
out the e-bar. Jenson has a slanted e-bar, 
and Minion does not. If your client uses 
Minion Pro for correspondence, you shouldn’t 
choose Jenson for identity pieces.
room to write below the previous line, and enough 
horizontal room to write a hyphenated last name, or a 
very long city name. Never consider a form complete 
unless you have “completed” the form yourself. Choose 
a paper stock that won’t smudge when written on 
with a pencil, a felt tip pen, or a ballpoint pen.
A Sample Job
This chapter will focus on the development of an 
identity package for a psychologist beginning a new 
practice. The psychologist, Dr. Rosemary Tollefson, 
needs identity pieces (letterhead, envelope, business 
card); a display advertisement for the phone book; 
and a ¾   page, vertical newspaper display ad. Although 
each piece has its distinctive design and typographic 
challenges, all the pieces retain a visual unity that 
identifies them as members of the same family. When 
you have completed this identity package, you may 
want to print each piece on high-quality colored or 
textured paper stock, for use in your portfolio.
Identity Packages
Dr. Tollefson is a 30-something, tree-hugging intellectual. 
She dislikes the traditional look of the printed materials 
most counseling services use. She chose the rose as her 
symbol for three reasons:
(1) it is living; (2) it is expressive and classic; and
(3) it ties in with her name. Here are some questions 
you can ask your clients when designing logos:
▶ Does the image convey the correct tone
for the business?
▶ Can it be enlarged and reduced
without losing legibility?
▶Does it avoid any negative connotations?
▶Is it copyright free?
▶ Can the image be used for ten years
without being dated?

Design Considerations For Letterhead
Does anyone use a typewriter anymore? Hardly. So, make sure the paper you select 
for a letterhead will go through a laser or ink jet printer. Find out what typeface 
the client uses most often and try to coordinate that typeface with the one used 
in the letterhead. You may want to avoid gradients and screened background 
images if the letters will often be photocopied. Keep your client’s budget in 
mind during the design phase—a nice effect can be created with colored ink on 
white or colored paper stock. Use the best paper stock your client can afford. 
Remember that some paper surfaces don’t reproduce well on a photocopier. 
Include bleed images only if the client’s budget can afford the extra cost of 
printing on an oversized sheet and cutting it down to letter size. If you have to 
choose between better paper and a bleed, choose better paper every time!
Use care when including names of personnel on the letterhead—if a person 
or position changes, all the old letterhead gets tossed. Ouch! Double-check 
all the information provided by the client. (Ask for a business card with the 
correct information.) Send a test fax just to confirm the fax number. Call 
your client and tell her the fax is coming—that way you can confirm the 
fax and phone number at the same time! I prefer designing the letterhead 
first—then I create a library and add the letterhead elements to it.
Design Considerations for the Identity Package Letterhead
Visual 10–2 shows the top of the letterhead. The typeface used in all pieces 
is Adobe Garamond Pro. Typefaces followed by the word “Pro” have a 
wide selection of ornaments, ligatures, alternate letters, and symbols that 
can be viewed in the Glyphs panel. Notice the academic degree, Ph.D., 
listed after the name. When academic degrees follow the name, they look 
best set in small caps. Use either the degree (Rosemary Tollefson, Ph.D.) 
or the title (Dr. Rosemary Tollefson) with the name, but not both.

Visual 10–3 shows the lower portion of the letterhead, with the contact 
information positioned at the bottom of the page. This example uses numbers 
that extend below the baseline. These “lowercase” numbers are called old-
style figures or text figures. Numbers that sit on the baseline are called titling 
figures or lining figures. Titling figures are ideal for use with display type and are 
sometimes used within body copy. Old-style figures are used within text and 
are rarely used in display type. Old-style figures have a graceful, elegant look.
Design Considerations For Envelopes
There are two things you should remember when designing envelopes: (1) allow at 
least an 18-pt. margin at the top and left edges; and (2) don’t design an envelope with 
multiple colors that overlap or are close together (this is called tight register), unless 
your client has an ample budget. Printing a four-color envelope, with tight register 
and bleeds, is expensive because it has to be printed on a flat sheet, then die-cut, 
folded, and glued (a process called converting). Envelopes typically don’t include 
the phone and fax number—but when elements are dragged in from a library to use 
on another piece, this can easily happen. You will want to watch for this. The image 
and type on an envelope will probably be smaller than that on the letterhead, but the 
size relationship should remain about the same. A standard commercial business-
size envelope is called a #10, with dimensions of 4⅛   × 9½   inches. A #9 business 
response envelope fits nicely inside a #10. Its dimensions are 3⅞   × 8⅞   inches.

If you don’t have a chart of envelope styles and sizes, do a Google search for 
“envelope sizes.” Several envelope sites will have information you can download 
and print. A nice reference site for envelope sizes is www.designerstoolbox.com.
Design Considerations for the Identity Package Envelope
Visual 10–5 shows the details of the upper left corner of the envelope. 
Elements were initially placed from a snippet, but need editing for the 
envelope. Notice that old-style figures are still used for the address, and 
an ample margin has been maintained on the upper and left edges.
Design Considerations For Business Cards
The client’s budget determines whether or not you should design a card with 
a bleed. A standard business card size is 3½   × 2 inches. Allow at least a ⅛   inch 
margin inside the card. When designing landscape orientation cards, I try to keep 
the name prominent and important contact information in the lower right corner. 
That’s where the eye usually stops last, and I don’t want to waste a “hot” corner on 
a fax number! Discuss imposition with the printer. The imposition is how the card 
should be laid out for printing: 1-up, 2-up, 8-up, and so on. Sometimes the printer 
wants you to step and repeat your card many times on a single sheet of letter-
size paper. Other times, a single card, centered on the sheet, will be requested.
Designers become very comfortable working in point size and leading 
with whole number increments of one or two points. In smaller type, one 
point is a much more significant unit of measure than it is for display 
type. When working at smaller type sizes, you will find yourself setting a 
leading value of 8.75 points, or a type size of 7.5 points, for example.
Changing Point Size and Leading Keyboard Shortcut Defaults
By now, using the shortcut keys to change point size and leading has become second 
nature. In the Getting Started section of Chapter 1, I recommended that you change 
the InDesign program preferences so that those keyboard shortcuts would enlarge

or reduce in smaller increments. If you didn’t change your preferences earlier in the 
Getting Started section in Chapter 1, you should do it now. When you want new 
preferences to apply to all future documents, the preferences should be changed when 
no document is open. When you change preferences with a document open, the 
changes apply only to the current document. If you are a Mac user, choose InDesign> 
Preferences>Units & Increments. In the Keyboard Increments section, change the 
Size/Leading to 1 pt. and the Baseline Shift to 1 pt. (Visual 10–6). Windows users, 
choose Edit>Preferences>Units & Increments and follow the same procedure.
Design Considerations for the Identity Package Business Card
Visual 10–7 shows the business card for Rosemary Tollefson. Notice that the 
typefaces are the same here, as the other pieces. It’s very important to maintain 
the size relationship of text to graphics on all the pieces. Use the flush right 
tab (Shift+Tab) to align the email and cell phone text to the right margin.

Design Considerations For Newspaper Display Ads
Accurate measurement is essential when designing for newspapers. Each paper has 
standard dimensions to follow when preparing ads. Visual 10–8 shows a sample 
production worksheet for a Milwaukee, Wisconsin daily paper. When creating a 
newspaper ad, close enough is not good enough! Convert fractions into decimals, 
and enter those measurements in the New Document dialog box. As you can see 
in Visual 10–8, the advertisements 
butt right up to text or another 
ad, with no room for error.
Many display ads are designed with an 
outer border. When adding a stroke 
to a text or graphics frame, you must 
specify that the stroke goes inside 
the frame. If the stroke is centered on 
the frame or placed on the outside of 
the frame, the dimension will change 
and the advertisement will not fit 
the newspaper specifications. If you 
frequently place newspaper ads, 
creating document presets for each size, 
and object styles with strokes aligned 
to the inside, would considerably 
reduce the margin of error.
When designing for newsprint, 
recognize that your final piece may 
not look like your laser print. Some 
newsprint is porous and the ink 
will spread. The counters of letters 
tend to fill in, so avoid using very 
small point sizes whenever possible. 
When your advertisement includes 
a photograph or a scan, work closely 
with the production department so 
that you provide the correct resolution 
and line screen. A piece that looks 
good printed on your laser printer, 
may look “muddy” in newsprint, 
because the halftone dots will fill in.
VISUAL |10–8 |
Every newspaper and magazine 
publication has a different set of 
ad sizes. Always double check 
that your size specification 
is correct before submitting 
an ad for publication!

Design Considerations for the
Identity Package Newspaper Display Ad
Visual 10–9 shows a sample of the display ad. The words Open House require negative 
tracking, which is common when working with display type. The phone number at 
the bottom of the ad, and the time at the top, are set in lining (uppercase) figures. It 
is appropriate to use lining figures in this instance because the numbers are being 
used in display type. The open house time, 2:30–5:00 pm, is separated by an en 
dash, used to indicate a range of time. The abbreviation “pm” is set in small caps, 
and including the periods is optional. If you don’t have a typeface with small caps, 
it is permissible to set it in lowercase letters with periods (p.m.). The body copy is 
set in italic type, with the OpenType fractions option turned on. Normally book 
titles are set in italic, but when the surrounding body copy is italic, the book title 
is set in Roman, as in the title of Dr. Tollefson’s book, Believe in Yourself. You’ll also 
note that the bulleted copy contains a reference to attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, as ADHD. When setting an acronym, no period is placed after each letter.

This display ad demonstrates 
several typographic nuances: 
the use of roman type within 
italic text, showing acronyms 
without periods, and setting PM.

When body copy is italic, 
names of books, plays, musical 
compositions—things which 
would normally be in italic, 
are set in Roman type.

Designing for the Phone Book
Scan through the yellow pages ads in a phone book and you will see that they’ve 
been designed by people with a wide range of design skills. Some ads include 
gradients and mushy photos, condensed or expanded type—that is almost 
impossible to read—and typographic blunders such as all-capital italics and 
incorrect quotation marks. You can also find some examples of excellent layout 
and readability. What makes the difference between a strong or a poor ad? The 
ability to use type, combined with an understanding of the printing process. A 
well-designed, 2½  " square ad, packs more punch than a poorly designed ½  ²page 
ad! When you design an ad for the yellow pages, first look at samples to see what 
doesn’t work. Then look specifically at what the competition is doing, and design 
an ad that will beat the best sample. It is a time-consuming process to fine-tune 
small display ads. Some people assume a small ad will require less production time. 
In reality, it takes more time to create an effective small ad than a larger display ad, 
because every incremental spacing decision you make in a small ad is critical!
Design Considerations for the Identity Package Yellow Pages Ad
Visual 10–10 shows the yellow pages 
display ad, at actual size. The text portion 
is basically in a centered format—except 
the bulleted copy is flush left. Sometimes 
you see bulleted copy centered, leaving 
the left sides ragged (Visual 10–11). 
Setting bulleted copy in this manner 
is a poor design technique. When the 
bullets are not flush left, they blend 
in with the body copy and defeat the 
purpose of using them in the first place!
Here is the best way to align bulleted 
copy, while centering it in the text block:
▶Center all bulleted text. Position 
a vertical guideline flush to the 
bullet of the longest line.
▶Then, change the alignment of 
the bulleted text to flush left.
▶Finally, apply a left indent 
to push all the bulleted copy 
to the guideline you placed 
earlier. Now the text is flush 
left, but the longest line is still 
centered in the text column.
VISUAL |10–10 |
The italic type has been 
changed to a semibold weight 
to accommodate the paper 
quality used in yellow pages. 
Tiny serifs are not always 
visible on low-quality paper.

Summary
Business forms are a rigorous production test for typesetters and designers. It is our 
responsibility to make sure that forms project the appropriate corporate image, are 
easy to read, and are easy to complete. When you are given the task of producing 
an order form, a sell sheet, or a catalog price grid, see it as a design challenge. Flex 
your typesetting muscles. And remember, as a wise designer once said, “There are 
no mediocre projects, just mediocre designers.”
VISUAL |10–12 |
This Victorian era- style 
political poster demonstrates 
that type can be a powerful 
design element. Designers 
who are comfortable working 
with type and have strong 
InDesign production skills, are 
the best at creating type-heavy 
forms that are both functional 
and aesthetically pleasing.

introduction
A semitrailer got stuck underneath an overpass. It was in so tight that the driver couldn’t move 
ahead or back up. Engineers and construction workers walked all around the stuck truck, calculating 
the height of the trailer and the clearance of the overpass. They thought of jackhammers, winches, 
hydraulic pry bars—anything that might free the truck and get traffic moving again. Finally, 
after assessing the situation one little boy said, “Why don’t you let some air out of the tires?”
That boy was thinking outside the box. Business, education, government—everyone these days 
is looking for people who can see things from a different perspective. Perform a web search 
for “out of the box thinking” and you’ll come up with just a shade over two billion results.
You are about to work with text and graphics that are out of the box—or at least out of a frame. 
Up to now we have used rectangles and ovals of various shapes and sizes. In this chapter, we 
explore text on a path, inline graphics, and gradients—features that will let you out of the box.

Type: A Versatile Design Element
When reviewing student portfolios, I look for two things: use of type and use of 
color. When a designer has control of these two critical design elements, everything 
else will fall into place. Even in black and white, type has “color” and text blocks 
can range in color from light gray to strong black. Typefaces also express a wide 
range of personalities inherent in their design. Visual 11–1 shows a collection 
of ampersands, each interesting and expressing a different personality.
In this first exercise, we’re going to add another ingredient to the type color-
personality mixture: shape. The ability to create type that follows a path used to 
be the domain of illustration programs. Thanks to InDesign, these great special 
effects are right at your fingertips. So, launch InDesign and let’s get started.
Placing Type on a Closed Shape
In order to place text on a path, first you need a path! Then you 
need the Type on a Path tool, accessed by pressing Shift+T or by 
selecting it from the “hidden tool” menu, under the Type tool.
1. 
Create a new document. Draw a 
rectangle and apply a 1 pt. stroke.
2. 
Select the Type on a Path tool by pressing 
Shift+T. Position the tool cursor over the 
edge of the rectangle. A plus sign on the 
cursor indicates that the tool has recognized 
a path and is ready for action (Visual 11–2).

3. 
 Click on the path to create a starting point. Type a line of text that extends 
around the rectangle. Highlight the text and change the point size and 
style. Change the alignment. The text considers the first point you clicked 
with the Type on a Path tool as the left margin. As you center and right-
align the text, it will flow clockwise around the outside of the frame.
4. 
Visual 11–3 shows two vertical lines called 
the Start and End brackets. (The path object 
must be selected and either selection tool 
must be active for you to see these.) By 
default, the brackets are butted up to each 
other, indicating that the text path extends 
around the entire rectangle. You can move the 
Start and End brackets to fine-tune the position of the text on your path. The Start 
and End brackets have in and out ports that work just like any other text frame.
5. 
Select the End bracket. Do not click on its out port; instead click on the upper 
part of the line (the cursor arrow will show a sideways “t” when you are able 
to click on the bracket). Slowly drag the End bracket counter-clockwise, 
closer to the end of the text (Visual 11–4). If you pull the bracket too far, the 
overset symbol will appear. Just bring the bracket to the end of the text.
6. 
If you look carefully in the center of the path, 
you will see a tiny vertical line (Visual 11–4). 
This line is the Center bracket (also called 
the Flip tool), and if you click and drag on 
the Center bracket with either Selection 
tool, you can move your text back and 
forth around the edge of the rectangle.
7. 
If you drag the Center bracket in toward 
the center of the rectangle, your text 
will flow inside the box. Flip your text 
inside and outside a few times until it 
feels comfortable to you (Visual 11–5).
That was easy enough. Try the same 
technique with a circle as the path object. 
Be sure to flip the text inside and outside the circle, as in Visual 11–6. When the 
type is in place, you will want to set the stroke of the path object to [None.]

Placing Type on an Open Path
Most of the time, you will be creating your own path for type to follow. Type 
can be placed on paths of any shape. We’ll create a few paths using the Pencil 
and Pen tools. You may not use the Pencil tool very often, but you should know 
it’s there. If this is your first time using the Pen tool, note that Chapter 14 will 
go into detail on using it—you’ll just get your toes wet in this chapter.
1. 
Select the Pencil tool by pressing N or by selecting it from the Toolbox. Draw 
some squiggles similar to those in Visual 11–7. The Pencil tool makes rough, 
random-looking paths. (The Pen tool makes smooth, curvy paths.)
2. 
Select the Type on a Path tool and click on one of your paths. (You don’t need 
to select the path first.) Fill the line with text. You can use placeholder text if 
you prefer. Fill the remaining lines with text. Now experiment with the position, 
size, and color of your type. The results should look similar to Visual 11–8.

3. 
Use Command+A (Mac) or Control+A (Windows) to select and delete the text 
lines created with the Pencil tool. Drag down two horizontal guidelines about 
1.5" apart. Select the Pen tool by pressing P. Position the cursor by the left margin 
guide and click once on the bottom guidelines (do not drag). Position the cursor 
over the top guideline, but over to the right of the first point and click. This will 
create a diagonal line extending from the bottom to the top guidelines. Next, 
position the cursor on the bottom guideline, over to the right of the second 
point and click to create another diagonal line. Continue this pattern across 
the page to make a zigzag pattern, similar to what you see in Visual 11–9.
4. 
Switch to the Direct Selection tool and move the guides out of the way or delete them. 
Click on an anchor point and drag it. Move it from side to side, then up and down. 
Continue moving all the points until your zigzag is a total mess (Visual 11–10). Now you 
know how to use the Pen tool to click from point to point, and to create paths made 
of straight line segments. Let’s see what else the Pen tool can do. Delete your path.

5. 
Pull down two horizontal guides about 2" apart. You’re going to make another path 
similar to the zigzag, except that you will make it with curved segments. With the Pen 
tool, click where the lower guideline meets the left margin guide to create the end 
point of your new path. Here’s where the tricky part of creating curved segments comes 
in. Position the cursor over the top guideline, to the right of the end point, and click 
without releasing the mouse. This creates a “smooth” corner point. Without releasing the 
mouse, drag horizontally and you will see two handles extend from the corner point. 
These are called direction lines. As you drag them out, a curved line segment will develop. 
Move the cursor along the guideline to see how changing the length of the direction 
line affects the shape of the curve. Release the mouse when the curved segment looks 
similar to the one in Visual 11–11. Move to the lower guideline, click to make the next 
anchor point, and drag horizontally to create another curved line segment. Continue 
this process until you have waves, similar to those in Visual 11–11. Now you know 
how to use the Pen tool to make curved line segments by clicking and dragging.
6. Now, create a bizarre-looking path 
using a combination of clicks (straight 
line segments) and drags (curved line 
segments). Your mess should look 
just as bad as mine in Visual 11–12. To 
end the path, choose another tool or 
Command+click or Control+click 
anywhere on the page. When you’re 
ready to move on, select your line 
with the Selection tool and delete it.
7. 
Now we’re going to make a path in the shape of an arch. If you deleted your two 
horizontal guidelines, drag down new ones, about 2" apart. With the Pen tool, 
position the cursor over the lower guide, click and drag up. A directional line 
will extend from each side of the starting point. Keep dragging, trying to keep 
the upper directional line at a 45-degree angle. When the end of the directional 
line touches the upper guideline, release the mouse (Visual 11–13A).

8. 
Now position the Pen tool back on the lower guide, approximately 5" to the right 
of the first point. Click to set an anchor point and drag the direction line down at 
approximately 45 degrees. Notice that the upper direction line angles back toward the 
upper direction line of the first point (Visual 11–13B). When you release the mouse, 
you should have a nice arch (Visual 11–13C). Use the Text on a Path tool to add text 
to the arch and experiment with the various options you have learned so far.
You may realize it would be much easier just to draw an ellipse and place 
the text on its path, rather than using the Pen tool to create the arch shape. 
And you’re right. But very often, you will want to use text paths that 
don’t fit pre-made shapes—like the one you’re going to create next.
9. 
Delete the arch-shaped path and drag down one horizontal guide. With the 
Pen tool, click on the guideline and drag up and to the right at a 45-degree 
angle. Release the mouse when the direction handle is about 1 inch long.
10. 
About 4" away, click on the guideline to 
set another anchor point again. Hold Shift, 
and drag the directional handle up and 
to the right to constrain to a 45-degree 
angle. Release the mouse button when your path looks like Visual 11–14.
11. 
Go ahead, use the Type on a Path tool 
and place some text on it. Then flip the 
type using the Center bracket line. If there 
is a stroke applied to the path, remove 
it to see only the text (Visual 11–15).
12. 
Highlight all the text on the path. Change the color to Paper. Select the path using 
either Selection tool. Change the stroke width of the path to be much wider than the 
point size of your text. Choose Type>Type on a Path>Options. When the Type on a Path 
Options dialog box opens, change the Align and To Path fields to Center to position 
the type vertically on the path (Visual 11–16). This is a technique you will often use.

Creating Shadowed Type
The Effects panel manages a variety of transparency effects, including drop 
shadows. The Effects panel can be opened by using the keyboard shortcut, 
Shift+Command+F10 (Mac) or Shift+Control+F10 (Windows.)
The Effects panel allows you to choose which parts of the element you want to modify 
(Visual 11–17A). When you select Object, the effect is applied to the entire object—
its stroke, fill, and text. Stroke affects the object’s stroke (and gap color). Text affects 
all the text inside the frame. (You can’t apply an effect to individual words or letters 
in a frame.) Graphic affects only the graphic selected with the Direct Selection tool.
Choose an effect from the panel menu options, or by clicking on the fx button on the 
bottom of the Effects panel. (You can also click the fx button on the Control panel.) 
When you choose an effect, a dialog box opens that allows you to specify attributes of 
that effect.

The Effects panel and its drop shadow menu options are shown in 
Visual 11– 17B. When you are applying a drop shadow to text, you will want 
to adjust the opacity of the shadow (75% is usually too dark). A box in the 
lower left corner summarizes the effects applied to a selected object.
Create Text Outlines
One of the greatest features of InDesign is the ability to convert text to outlines. 
Once text is converted to outlines, it is no longer text, so you can’t correct 
spelling or apply normal text attributes. Instead, each letter is a tiny piece of 
artwork, giving you the ability to modify the shape or paste an image into it.
1. 
Type the phrase Buttered Popcorn! Apply a Blue fill. (Visual 11–18). Use the 
Selection tool to activate the frame, and press Shift+Command+O (Mac) or 
Shift+Control+O (Windows) to convert the text into outlines. You can also 
choose Type>Create Outlines. Now when you look closely at the type, you will 
see a series of anchor points. Even though each letter is now an individual 
shape, the letters are still linked together as one object—a compound path.
2. 
With the outline type selected, choose 
Object>Paths>Release Compound Path and 
the text unit will split apart. Now you can 
move and rotate each letter with the Selection 
tool. Notice, however, that all the counters 
are filled in. Select both the counter and the 
letter outline, and go to Window>Object 
& Layout>Pathfinder>Subtract. The counter will be cut out (subtracted) from the 
underlying letterform. Repeat this process for all the letters with counters (Visual 11–19).
3. 
Delete the dot from the exclamation point. Draw a small text frame in the dot’s position 
and insert an ornament from the Glyphs panel. Add a drop shadow and a pillow emboss. 
Pillow Emboss is an option under the Bevel and Emboss page of the Effects panel.
VISUAL |11–18 |

outlines, each letter is converted 
to paths with editable points.

Creating Shaped Text Frames
By now, you’re an old pro at putting text inside a frame. This exercise 
will teach you how to create a shaped frame using the Pen tool.
1. 
Delete the images in your document. Select the Pen tool. Click or drag to make an 
irregularly-shaped, closed object. When you are ready to close the shape, position the Pen 
tool cursor close to the path’s starting point. You will see a tiny circle appear next to the 
pen tool icon. This circle indicates that your next click will join the two ends of the path, 
making a closed shape. Your shape should look very strange, similar to Visual 11–21A.
2. 
Click inside the new shape with the Type tool. You should see a blinking cursor. Fill 
with placeholder text. Select all the text and change to justified alignment. Adjust the 
point size and typeface until you have a fairly even fill (Visual 11–21B). Try changing 
the shape’s stroke width to 0 pt. Deselect all and press W to preview your type. .
Bitter Apple Game Preserve
In the following exercise you will use the Page tool to create a document with multiple 
page sizes. You’ll be creating a two-sided, full-color flyer, season pass button/sticker, 
letterhead, business card, and envelope for Bitter Apple Game Preserve. You will 
use the Gradient tool, create text on a path, convert text to outlines, create inline 
frames to contain graphics, and apply drop shadows and feathering. Visual 11–22 
shows how the finished pieces will look. We will begin with the button. You will 
need the 11 Artwork and Resources folder found on the accompanying CD.
VISUAL |11–21 |
First, an odd-shaped closed 
path was created with the Pen 
tool. The, text was added and 
alignment justified to create 
an irregularly-shaped text 
block with defined edges.

Make the Apple with a Gradient Fill
We’re going to create the logo first, so that it can be applied to the rest of the 
elements. You will be using a template created for this project. A template is a 
document that is used as a pattern, and has an “.indt” file extension. A document 
can be saved as a template by choosing Save>Format>InDesign CS5 template 
(Mac), or Save>Save as type>InDesign CS5 template (Windows). This template 
has been prepared with the correct size, bleed, guidelines, layers, and swatches.
1. 
Open 11 Project Template.indt from the Chapter 11 Artwork and Resources folder. Copy 
11 Bitter Apple.indl to your hard drive or desktop. The library already has some elements 
in it and you will be adding additional project elements to it, as they are completed. 
From the library, bring Outlined Apple to the center of Page 1, with the label Sticker/
Button in the bottom slug area. This glyph has already been converted to outlines.
2. 
Select the apple shape with the Selection tool. Copy it and then use 
Paste in Place so that it is exactly on top of the original shape.
3. 
Change the reference point on the Control panel so that it is in 
the center. Press the Flip Horizontal control on the Control panel. 
You now have an apple with two leaves (Visual 11–23A).
4. 
Use the Selection tool to adjust the position of the top apple so that the edges line up 
(Visual 11–23B). You may also use the left and right arrow keys to nudge the element 
into place. Zoom in close to the edge of the apple to be as precise as possible.
5. 
With the Selection tool, select both apple shapes. Choose Object>Pathfinder>Add. 
This command adds the shapes together to make one whole apple shape. 
With the shape still selected, choose Object>Paths>Release Compound 
Path. You have now separated the apple from the leaves.
6. 
 Select the leaves and fill them with PANTONE DS 293-1 C green.

|  Chapter 11 |
7. 
Select the apple shape and then apply the Apple gradient. This is a radial fill, which 
means the color blends out from the center like rays of the sun. Use the Gradient tool, 
found on the Toolbox (press G), to adjust the length and direction of the fill. Click and 
drag the Gradient tool inside the apple, from edge to edge. 
Now change the starting location of the gradient by clicking the 
Gradient tool in another position and drag again. Hold down 
the Shift key to constrain it to a perfect horizontal or vertical 
blend. Reverse the direction of the line to reverse the blend. 
Do this several times until you understand how this tool works. 
Keep the Gradient tool inside the apple so the whole blend will 
be in that defined area. When you’re finished experimenting, 
make the final gradient blend red in the top left corner to 
white in the lower right (Visual 11– 24). Group the apple and 
the leaves and drag the element into the library. Move the 
apple in your document over to the pasteboard for now.
Create Curved Button Text
The next step in the button project is to run text around the circle that 
creates the perimeter of the button. Follow the directions carefully and 
you’ll see the advantage of using layers when placing this type.
1. 
On Page 1, go to the layer named Background Circle.
Hold down Shift+Option (Mac) or Shift+Alt (Windows), and draw a circle out 
from the center guides. Watch the W and H 
coordinates, and when they read 4.375" release 
your mouse. Fill it with Blue (C=100. M=90, Y=10, 
K=0). Lock and hide the layer (Visual 11–25).
2. 
Move to the Background Gradient layer. Hold down 
Shift+Option (Mac) or Shift+Alt (Windows), and 
draw a 4" circle out from the center guides. Apply [None] for the stroke and fill.
3. 
Select the circle and open the Layers panel. Hold Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) and 
drag the red square on the Background Gradient layer up to the Text and Photos layer. 
You will see a plus sign, which means a copy of the 
circle is being placed on the next layer (Visual 11–26).
4. 
Hide the Text and Photos layer. Move down one 
layer to the Background Gradient layer so that we 
can add copy on the circle. Select the Type on a Path

Fill: [Paper]. Stroke: Blue (C=100. M=90, Y=10, K=0) Move the End bracket on the text 
path to about 0.025" from the end of the type. Align Center. Choose Type>Type on a 
Path>Options, and set the Align field to Ascender and the To Path field to Bottom.
5. Using the Selection tool, find the center 
flip bracket and align it to the center page 
guide. Make sure you are outside of the 
circle path when you release the mouse 
button or your type will not stay inside of 
the circle. Now your text is centered at the 
top of the circle. Remove any stroke or fill on the circle. When you are working with 
text on a curve you usually need to adjust the tracking. This sample was tracked 
to +100 (Visual 11–27). Lock and hide the layer while we do the next step.
6. Turn on the Text and Photos layer. 
Select the circle. Choose the Type on a 
Path tool and type May–September 2010 
on the circle in 30 pt. Myriad Pro Bold 
Condensed. Fill: [Paper]. Stroke: Blue. 
Choose Type>Type on a Path>Options, 
and set the Align field to Descender and the To Path field to Top. Move the type 
to the bottom center of the circle and track letters to +60. This time, make 
sure the center flip bracket is inside of the circle path when you release the 
mouse button or your type will not stay inside of the circle (Visual 11–28).
7. 
 Make all the layers visible and drag the 
apple in from the pasteboard. Move the 
apple to the top layer. You will need to 
resize the apple to fit in the type. To resize 
the apple, select it with the Selection tool 
and hold Shift, as you drag in a corner.
8. 
Draw a text frame and type Bitter Apple in Chaparral Pro Bold 34-pt. 
Fill: Yellow. Type Game Preserve in Myriad Pro Bold 14 pt., all caps. Fill: Yellow. 
To center the text accurately, pull the edges of the text frame out to the circle 
guide and use Shift+Cmd+C (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+C (Windows) to center the 
text. Adjust the leading as needed. Position and size the text frame and apple 
inside the circle, as shown in Visual 11–30. Your button is almost complete.

Use the Pathfinder Tool 
to Create the Logo’s Frame
We’re going to create two shapes, and then use the Pathfinder tool to add the shapes 
together, making a rectangular frame with an arch.
1. 
Go to Page 2. Select the Rectangle Frame tool and click on your 
page. When the dialog box comes up, enter 1.3" for the width and 
0.75" for the height. Stroke and fill should be [None].
2. 
Select the Ellipse Frame tool and hold Shift+Option or Shift+Alt to draw a circle out 
from the center of the rectangle. Make the circle slightly narrower than the rectangle. 
Use the Align panel to align the horizontal centers of the objects and move the 
circle up so that your two shapes look similar to the example in Visual 11–31A
3. 
Select both shapes and choose Object>Pathfinder>Add (Visual 11–31B). 
The shapes should blend together as in Visual 11–31C. (This is the same 
technique we used earlier to blend the two apple shapes into one shape.)

Creating the Front of the Flyer
In this step, we’ll drop in a gradient and pull elements in from the library. 
Visual 11–34 shows the front of the finished flyer for reference.
1. 
Go to Page 2. Make sure you are working on the Background gradient layer. 
Draw a rectangle that fills the page from the bleed in the upper left corner 
to the bleed in the lower right corner. Fill the rectangle with Background 
gradient Use the Gradient tool to place the dark blue on the top and the green 
on the bottom. Hold down the Shift key to constrain it to a vertical blend.
2. 
Move to the Text and Photos layer. Drag in the photos and headline from the 
library using the guides for placement. Add an ellipsis to the end of the headline. 
You make a true ellipsis by pressing Option+; (Mac) or Alt+; (Windows).
3. 
Draw a 1-point line on the bottom margin guide, color [Paper]. Using the 
Stroke panel, set the Start and End fields of the rule to CircleSolid. Drag 
the logo in from the library and position it as shown in Visual 11–34.

The Back of the Flyer
As you finish the back of the flyer, you will learn how to add inline frames. 
Most of the hard work is already done—you’ll be pulling most of the 
elements in from the library. The finished back looks like Visual 11–35.
1. 
Go to Page 3. Make sure you are on the Background Gradient layer. Draw a frame from 
bleed to bleed and fill it with the Background Gradient swatch. Using the Gradient 
tool, adjust the color so that the green is on the top and the blue is on the bottom.
2. 
Move to the Text and Photos layer. Drag in the text block and 
photos from the library. Place a 1-point [Paper] rule on the bottom 
margin and use the Stroke panel to add a circle to each end.
3. 
Go to Page 2 and select the logo with the Selection tool. Copy 
the logo. Now go to Page 3 and use Paste in Place. The logo 
should be in the exact same location as on the cover.

The apple at the beginning of each subhead is an inline graphic. An inline 
graphic is connected with the text so that it flows just like a word or letter. It’s 
created by first copying the graphic and then pasting it into the text line.
4. 
Find the apple you created earlier and copy 
it onto the pasteboard of Page 3. Select it 
with the Selection tool. Hold down Shift and 
pull a corner inward until the apple is very 
small, approximately 0.2" (Visual 11–36).
5. 
Copy the apple, and then switch to the Type
tool and place the cursor in front of the first 
letter of the first subhead. Paste the apple and add a space. The graphic now sits on the 
baseline with the type. Even though it is connected to a text line, you can still adjust its 
vertical position using the Selection tool. Repeat the procedure for the second subhead.
6. 
Pull the button you made earlier in from 
the library and place it on the pasteboard of 
Page 3. Select it with the Selection tool and 
reduce it proportionately by holding down 
Shift+Command (Mac) or Shift+Control 
(Windows). Drag it into position at the top 
of the page. Select it with the Selection 
tool. In the Control panel, make sure 
the reference point is in the middle. Use 
the Selection tool to rotate the button, 
as shown in Visual 11–37. Add a drop shadow with an opacity of 35%.
There are subtle differences in the use of the Command (Mac) or Control 
(Windows) modifier keys when resizing elements. If there’s no type or type 
on a path selected, use Shift+Drag to proportionately resize the elements. If 
the selection contains type or type on a path, use Shift+Command (Mac) or 
Shift+Control (Windows) and drag a corner to proportionately resize the objects.
7. 
Use the Selection tool and pull in the Full Season $40 line from the library. 
Position it next to the button, as shown in Visual 11–35. Don’t close your

Using the Page tool for Multi-size Pages
InDesign lets you have more than one size page in a single document. This makes it 
easy to coordinate colors and design elements between related pieces. For instance, 
in this project we have a button/sticker, a flyer, and now we’re going to add corporate 
stationery to the mix. All of these pieces will use the same gradient blends, swatches, 
typefaces and graphic elements. Having all these pieces in one document is a great 
way to stay organized. The Page tool,
 located beneath the Direct Selection tool 
on the Toolbox, is used to create multi-size master pages or document pages.
1.  Use the Pages panel to add three pages to the end 
of the document. These pages should be based on 
the [None] master. Go to Page 4. Click on Page 4 
with the Page tool. When the page is highlighted on 
the Control panel, select US Business Card from the 
pull down menu to change the page size. Notice 
that your new page has retained the margins, bleed 
and slug area specified in the original document.
2. 
Go to Page 5. Use the Page tool to change the size to Letter. This page will 
be used for the letterhead. Go to Page 6. Use the Page tool to change the 
size to a #10 envelope. Enter W: 9.5, H: 4.125" on the Control panel.
3. 
Now you have your pages made—it’s time to add the design elements. Go to the 
Page 4. From Layout>Margins and Columns, change all margins to 0.125". Create a 
background gradient fill that is green on the bottom, and blue on top and extending 
to all four bleed guides. Find the logo in the library and 
resize it to fit in the lower left corner. Pull the Business 
Card text from the library. Add a 1 pt. [Paper] rule and 
use the Arrange commands to position it above the 
background, and below the logo (Visual 11–39).
4. 
Go to the letterhead on Page 5. Draw a rectangle with the width of 1.5". The rectangle 
should extend from the left bleed edge to the top and bottom bleed edges. Fill with 
the gradient, blue on the bottom, green on top. From the library, place the logo at 
the top margin of the rectangle (Visual 11–39). Pull the Letterhead information from 
the library and align the bottom of the copy block with the bottom of the logo.
5. 
For the envelope on Page 6, Place a 1.5" rectangle that extends to the left, top and 
bottom bleed edges. Position the logo at the left and top margins. Pull Envelope Address
from the library and center it under the logo. Your project is done!

Summary
This chapter introduced design techniques that can give text much more interest. 
Just as using too many typefaces can overpower a document, so can using too 
many text effects. Knowing how to use these techniques is the first step. Knowing 
when to use them is the second.

introduction
Henry Ford’s legendary adage, “You can paint it any color, so long as it’s black,” could well have been 
the motto for many printers during the last century. Printers might advertise that they “print red on 
Wednesdays and blue on Thursdays,” but black was the “bread and butter” color used everyday for 
almost all projects. There were some two- and three-color print jobs, but full-color printing, in catalogs 
for instance, was too expensive and out of reach for the average print consumer. How things have 
changed! Advances in printing have created a kaleidoscope of color options for jobs that in years past, 
would have been printed in basic black. Full-color printing is now affordable on the leanest budget.
With each technological change comes a new set of challenges. Today, designers need to 
understand the physical properties of color and production processes. They need to define 
and use color correctly in their documents, and focus on principles of design, while creating a 
layout alive with color. For those of us who began our careers using X-acto knives, rubylith, and 
acetate overlays to manually separate color on pasteup boards, any effort required to expand 
our knowledge base is a small price to pay for the ease of incorporating color in our layouts.

Color Essentials
One of the best decisions I made in my college career was to double major in graphic 
design, and printing and publishing. Understanding how document design and 
construction affects production, has been invaluable. The same project that is greeted 
with cheers when presented to a client, may elicit groans, after it is opened by the 
prepress technician. File construction tells a lot about the designer’s training and 
skill. A poorly constructed file will do more damage to a designer’s reputation than 
almost anything else. If that designer also misses production deadlines, vendors 
will shudder every time he walks through the door, because they know they will be 
working on a file that is not only late, but also technically incorrect! This chapter will 
focus on one file preparation area that can be challenging: specifying color. Then, 
Chapter 13 will discuss managing graphics files and images, and organizing fonts.
Specifying Color
Color is an important component in any project. If you don’t understand how color 
is created and how a piece will be printed, you will not be able to create a document 
that uses color correctly. Errors in using color are costly. Of course, color mistakes 
on garage sale posters, printed on your own color inkjet printer, aren’t going to 
ruin your life. But making a mistake on a catalog project, where accurate color is 
critical, will negatively impact your career. We will begin with some basic theory 
about the physical characteristics of color. For more information on the complex 
world of color, I recommend Graphic Communications Today, Fourth Edition, by 
William Ryan and Theodore Conover, published by Thomson Delmar Learning.
Color: Transmitted or Reflected Light Waves
Color is created by light waves that are either transmitted or reflected. Your computer 
monitor transmits light waves to create color. Three primary colors of light—
red, green, and blue (RGB)—are combined in different proportions to create the 
millions of colors on your screen. Colors displayed on a monitor are described 
by a formula that specifies the level of each component color. The range of levels 
goes from 0 to 255. For example, the formula R=255, G=55, B=45 would describe 
a bright red. RGB is additive color. This means that when the levels of RGB are 
at the maximum, 255, the color you see is white. When all RGB values are at 0, 
the color is black. When creating documents that will be viewed on a monitor, 
such as web pages, using colors defined by the RGB system are natural choices.
Ink and toner, on paper, work differently. They absorb some light waves and reflect 
the rest. The light waves that are reflected back to our eyes create the illusion of 
color. Color created by reflected light waves is called subtractive. That means that

|   Chapter 12 |
if all the light is absorbed (subtracted), we see 
black. The primary colors in subtractive color are 
cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). Formulas that 
specify the amounts of each component color are 
used to describe subtractive color. The bright red 
color described in the preceding paragraph would 
be expressed as C=0, M=91, Y=87. An important 
difference is that the range of levels is different, from 
0 to 100. It’s also appropriate to refer to the levels of 
component colors as percentages. In theory, when 
you combine pigments of pure cyan, magenta, and 
yellow, all the light waves will be absorbed and the 
color will look black. In reality, pure pigments are 
impossible to obtain, so 100% cyan, 100% magenta, 
and 100% yellow blend to create a washed-out black. 
That’s why black ink (referred to as K) is added in the 
printing process, to compensate for the weak black, 
created by the CMY combination. Now we’ve arrived 
at what is known as the CMYK color space. RGB 
(additive color) images are perfect for monitor or web 
display, but must be redefined as CMYK (subtractive) 
colors, before being commercially printed.
Printing: Spot or Process?
Commercial printers always work with subtractive 
color. Defining colors to print correctly on a press 
is one of the challenges designers face on a daily 
basis. In commercial printing, color is created by 
reflected light waves. That’s why it’s not a good 
idea to put colors in your InDesign file that are 
defined as RGB (transmitted light waves).
Commercial printers use ink, and they talk in terms 
of process color or spot color. Spot color ink is like 
a can of premixed paint. There are about a dozen 
basic ink colors that can be combined, in different 
proportions, to make thousands of spot color inks. 
Each spot color is described by a standardized number 
and a mixing ratio (another formula!). This enables 
printers anywhere in the world to mix up and match a 
When working with 
spot or process color, 
remember that what 
you see on your 
screen, is probably 
not what you will 
get from your 
commercial printer!
Unless a color calibration system is in place, 
every computer monitor will display color a little 
differently. Always use an ink swatch book to 
select colors for your printed document. Even if 
the colors don’t look just right on the screen, 
they will print correctly on a printing press.
A color at 100% is the 
actual hue. The hue can 
be tinted in increments, 
from very dark (90%) 
to very light (10%). The 
C at the end indicates 
that this is what the 
color will look like 
when printed on coated 
paper (as opposed 
to uncoated paper)

specific color, as long as they are using the same color/ink system. For instance, one 
popular color matching system is the Pantone Matching System®. When a printer 
in Philadelphia puts PANTONE® 541 on his press, it will be exactly the same color 
as the PANTONE 541, printed across the ocean in Calcutta. Tints of spot colors 
can also be used and are described in percentages: 0% to 100%. This allows you to 
use the full-strength spot color (100%) or lighter tints, to create a variety of color.
Many of your projects will be one-color documents­—and yes, black counts as a 
color. Business forms, reports, books—many of the materials we read every day are 
single-color documents, usually black and white. However, don’t underestimate 
the power of a well-designed single-color document! A blue, for example, can 
range from a pale 10% shade, to a strong 100% navy. And when it is printed on a 
sheet of cream paper, it can give the impression of a two-color job. For just slightly 
more than the cost of black ink, you can create an attractive document with just 
one spot color, incorporating tints and solids and good design skills. If your client 
wants a full-color brochure, but doesn’t have a full-color budget, suggest going with 
a two-color brochure using spot colors. Two spot colors, combined with careful 
paper selection, can give a project an upscale look without the upscale cost.
Process Color
Process color (also referred to as full-color) is much different from spot color. Full-
color posters, magazines, catalogs, artist prints—anything that has the full range of 
the color spectrum—will be printed using process colors. In process color printing, 
four basic transparent inks, in different tints, are printed on top of each other to 
create the illusion of many colors. As discussed earlier, these transparent colors are 
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK). Cyan is greenish-blue and magenta is a 
violet-red. When you look at a full-color job under a magnifying glass, you will see 
that the “color” is actually made from a series of tiny dots, printed close together. 
When each of the four inks is printed in the correct location, the dots merge 
together to give the impression of color. The color could be one hue (like a spot-
color ink) or the millions of color variations that create a photograph. However, 
when one ink color is printed slightly off from the others, it makes the finished 
image look distorted. This is called out of register. We have all seen examples of 
this when Sunday comics aren’t printed quite right and have a blurred image.
Applying Color to Your Document
InDesign has two panels for assigning color to objects: the Color panel and 
the Swatches panel. Although they have some overlapping features, each offers 
unique ways to create and apply color. Let’s start with the Color panel.
▶ production tip
Digital color printers (used for 
smaller full-color runs) often 
use cartridges of cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black toner.

1. 
Make a new document, 8.5" × 11". Press F6 to open the Color panel. At the bottom 
of the panel you will see a bar called the color spectrum. It will contain either 
a gradient of one single color or a rainbow of colors. If the spectrum contains 
a single color, click on the panel menu and choose CMYK (Visual 12–1).
2. 
Draw a rectangle and activate the Fill icon on the Toolbox. Move your 
mouse over the color spectrum on the Color panel and notice that 
your cursor turns into the Eyedropper tool. Click the Eyedropper tool 
on a color that looks good to 
to 
you. The rectangle instantly fills with 
the color you have selected. Notice 
that the Fill icon in the Toolbox 
has been updated with the 
same color. Click back and forth 
along the CMYK spectrum 
bar and fill your rectangle with different colors (Visual 12–2).
3. 
There are four sliders above the CMYK spectrum. These show 
the percentages of each of the four process colors. Slide the 
triangles along each of the individual color bars, noticing how the color 
changes and how the percentage values in the boxes to the right also 
change. Fine-tune your chosen color by making it a lighter shade.
4. 
Click on the [None] box (the square with the 
red diagonal line), at at the left of the CMYK 
spectrum. The rectangle now has no fill and 
the Fill icon on the Toolbox also indicates no fill. 
But you have not lost your color because a new 
box has appeared in the Color panel: Last Color
(Visual 12–3). Click on it and your last color returns. The smaller boxes, at the right of the 
CMYK spectrum, are for white or black fills. Remember that assigning White (a color), 
to the fill or stroke of an object, is not the same as applying None (no color at all).

Click on your rectangle with the Type tool and convert it to a text frame. The 
Color panel now indicates the color of the text. Type a short sentence and bump 
up the point size to fill the text frame. Select all the text and change the color 
of the text in the same way you changed the color of the rectangle. Remember 
to choose CMYK, if your color bar shows a spectrum of only one color.
6. 
Click on the text frame with one of the selection tools. The two small buttons below 
the Fill and Stroke icons in the Color panel (or the Toolbox) will now allow you to 
choose which color you change, either the text or the frame (Visual 12–4).
7. 
Open the Color panel options menu again and change the mode from CMYK to RGB 
(Visual 12–5). The shades of color do not change; but you are now working in additive 
color rather than subtractive color. The yellow triangle that sometimes appears above 
the color spectrum is the out of gamut warning. This is a warning that the RGB color 
you have selected will not reproduce satisfactorily in a CMYK printed document. If you 
click on the warning icon, the color will be modified to the closest CMYK equivalent.
Now that you have been introduced to the Color panel, a word of caution: 
The Color panel is handy for applying color in “quick and dirty” documents 
that you will output yourself, on your home color printer. But if you’re 
working in a production setting—and especially if your file is going out to a 
service bureau or a commercial printer—use the Swatches panel instead.

It is easy to change between 
single color, CMYK, and RGB 
color models. Always be 
aware of what color mode you 
are working in. CMYK is for 
commercial printing. RGB is 
basically for documents that 
will be viewed on a computer 
monitor, like web pages.

The Swatches Panel
The Swatches panel can do everything the Color panel does, but with one 
important difference: You can define each color in your document and 
assign it a meaningful name. Colors from the Color panel, like the ones 
you had so much fun clicking on in the preceding pages, are undefined and 
unnamed. This means it is difficult to track and manage them throughout 
your document. For professional purposes, keep the Color panel tucked away. 
Colors created and stored in the Swatches panel are much easier to manage.
Transfer an Undefined Color to the Swatches Panel
In the following exercise, you will learn how to convert an undefined 
color, created in the Color panel, into a color swatch.
1. 
Make sure the Color panel is open and the rectangle is active.
2. 
Press F5 to open the Swatches panel (Visual 12–6). To make room for 
additional swatches, lengthen the panel by dragging the lower right 
corner until the scroll bar disappears. Go back to the Color panel and 
make sure the Fill color icon for your active rectangle is active.

3. 
Open the Color panel options menu and choose Add to Swatches (Visual 12–7). The 
color of your frame is now a swatch in the Swatches panel and has changed from an 
undefined color, to a defined color. Do the same for the color you chose for your text.
4. 
There are other methods of transferring an undefined color to the Swatches panel. 
You can select your rectangle and click the New Swatch button at the bottom 
of the Swatches panel (shown in Visual 12–6). Or you can drag the Fill or Stroke 
color icon right from the Color panel and drop it into the Swatches panel.
Transfer an Undefined Gradient to the Swatches Panel
Generally, it is best to convert undefined colors to defined swatches. The same 
holds true for undefined gradients. Converting an undefined gradient to a gradient 
swatch is a process similar to the one you just completed for undefined color.
1. 
Open the Gradient panel (Window>Color>Gradient.) and choose Show Options under 
the panel menu. In the Type field, choose Linear or Radial. A linear gradient changes 
color along a line, a radial gradient radiates from one color to the next in a circular 
pattern. You should see a horizontal bar called a ramp, extending across the bottom 
of the Gradient panel. At the top and center of the ramp is a diamond. This diamond 
is a stop that defines the midpoint of the gradient. As you slide the stop toward either 
end of the ramp, you will see the gradient swatch in the upper left corner change.
2. 
Open the Color panel and arrange it so that it’s next to the Gradient 
panel. You’re going to apply some colors to the gradient.
VISUAL |12–7 |
An undefined color can easily 
be added to the Swatches 
panel by selecting Add to 
Swatches in the Color panel 
menu. The new swatch is now 
defined and is at the bottom 
of the Swatches panel list.

3. 
In the Gradient panel you should see two house-shaped icons below the ramp. 
If you don’t see them, click on the ramp and they will appear. These are the color 
stops. Click on the left color stop and then adjust the color sliders in the Color panel. 
Notice that the color stop in the Gradient panel changes accordingly (Visual 12–8).
4. 
Now, click on the right color stop. Apply a color using the Color panel. 
Experiment with adjusting the look of your gradient by sliding the midpoint 
and color stops to the left or the right. Watch as the gradient swatch in 
the upper left corner changes to reflect your color adjustments.
5. 
You can also apply color to a gradient from the Swatches panel. The process is similar to 
the one described above, but instead of choosing a color from the Color panel, you press 
Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) as you click on a color swatch from the Swatches panel.
6. 
Now we will define the gradient you have just created. Open the Swatches panel 
menu and choose New Gradient Swatch. When the New Gradient Swatch dialog 
box appears, you can name your new gradient swatch in the Swatch Name field.
7. 
An alternate method is to drag the color preview from the Gradient panel into the 
Swatches panel. Double-click the new swatch to open the Gradient Options dialog box 
and rename it. If you don’t see your gradient, select either the Show Gradient Swatches 
or Show All Swatches button at the bottom of the Swatches panel (shown in Visual 12–6).

The icons at the top of the Swatches panel should be familiar to you by now—Fill, 
Stroke, Formatting affects container, and Formatting affects text. There is also a field 
where you can set the tint of a selected color. The various colors in the list are those 
available to your document and are labeled with their CMYK values (Visual 12–7).
Create a Color Swatch from “Scratch”
You can define colors directly from the Swatches panel. But before you can define 
a color for your document, you must know whether you need to create spot or 
process colors. When you define a color in your document as spot, it means that 
the printer will premix the color according to the formula specified by your swatch 
book and then put the colored ink on the press. A plate on the press picks up the ink 
and transfers it to the paper. After the color is printed, the press is cleaned, a new 
plate is put on, and the ink is replaced with the next color needed. A job that uses 
yellow, blue, green, orange, red, and black will require six premixed colors and six 
plates—and a significant amount of time for mixing ink and cleaning the press.
Process color works differently. Instead of premixing each individual ink color, only 
four inks—cyan, magenta, yellow, and black—and four plates are used to create all the 
other colors that will be printed. The four colors are overlaid in various tints, to create 
the illusion of many colors. The six-color job we just discussed, could be printed 
by using only four inks and plates, and would require much less production time. 
Orange would be created by percentages of yellow and magenta. Green would be 
created by percentages of cyan and yellow, and so on. Of course, if your job only has 
two colors—two inks and two plates—then using spot colors would be the way to go.
A swatch book should be used at the design stage for selecting and defining either 
spot or process colors. The swatch book provides the exact color formula needed and 
shows an accurate sample of how the 
printed color will look. Basing a color 
selection on what you see on your 
computer screen is risky, because 
most monitors do not display color 
accurately. There are many variables 
that go into choosing color. Until you 
have a clear understanding of the 
printing process, it is a good idea to 
have an experienced designer check 
your document files, before you send 
them to the printer. We will now 
create a new process color swatch.
VISUAL |12–10 |
The Swatches panel has 
many options for displaying 
swatches. When Name is 
selected (the default), the 
colors in the list are displayed 
with their names next to them. 
If you select Small Swatch, 
the colors will be displayed 
as tiny swatches and no 
names. In this example, Large 
Swatch has been selected.

1. 
Choose New Color Swatch from the panel menu (Visual 12–10). A dialog 
box displaying the four CMYK sliders will open. The color settings in the 
dialog box will be for the last color selected in the Swatches panel.
2. 
If you know them, type in the percentages of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black that 
define your color. Or, slide the color bars until you get the color you want. InDesign will 
define and name the color for you, in terms of CMYK values, or you can deselect the 
Name with Color Value option box and assign it a name of your own choosing. It’s better 
to name a color by its CMYK values because that’s a language everyone understands. 
Even though a color may look exactly like what you saw when your cat was car sick, 
naming a color: Sick Kitty, conjures up a very different color in each person’s mind.
Make a New Gradient Swatch from “Scratch”
When you select New Gradient Swatch from the Swatches 
panel menu, you are making a defined gradient.
1. 
Choose New Gradient Swatch from the panel menu. Click on the starting 
color stop icon, at the left end of the gradient ramp. The Stop Color field 
becomes active, allowing you to select CMYK from the list and then adjust 
the sliders in the CMYK mode. You can also select Swatches from the 
Stop Color field list and then choose a color from your swatches.
2. 
Click the ending color stop icon, at the right side of the 
gradient ramp and assign it a different color.
3. 
Drag one of the Stop icons to the middle of the gradient ramp. 
Click below the ramp where the original color stop was, and a 
new stop will appear. Give this new stop a third color.
4. 
Slide the diamond-shaped midpoint stops, at the top of the 
gradient ramp to adjust the span of each color between color 
stops. Click OK to add this swatch to the Swatches panel.
The Show Gradient Swatches button at the bottom of the panel, limits the 
display to only the defined gradients in the document. If you have a gradient 
swatch selected and click the New Swatch button, the gradient swatch will be 
duplicated. If you select the Trashcan icon, the gradient swatch will be deleted.

Make a Color Tint Swatch
If you were designing a single-color document using many 
shades of the same blue, first you would want to create the solid 
blue swatch and then make tint variations from it.
1. 
Create a new swatch—Color Type: Spot, Color Mode: Pantone solid coated. 
Scroll down the list and select a Pantone blue that you like. Press Return.
2. 
With the new blue swatch selected, open the Swatches panel menu and choose 
New Tint Swatch. In the New Tint Swatch dialog box, drag the Tint slider to 
10% and click Add. You can type numerical values into the Tint field, but you 
have to press the Tab key before the Add button becomes active again.
3. 
Repeat this process, creating tint swatches 
from 10% to 90%, in 10% increments, using 
a green color. Click Done. Your Swatches 
panel should look like Visual 12–11. 
Notice that the percentage of each tint 
is displayed at the end of the name.
4. 
If the tint isn’t exactly what you want, you 
can double-click on the tint swatch in the 
panel list, and when the Swatch Options 
dialog box opens, adjust the sliders.
Changing the color values of a tint swatch 
also changes the values of the original color 
the swatch is based on. Be sure that when you 
are in the Swatch Options dialog box, you 
don’t change color values—unless you want 
the original color swatch to change, too.
Adding Swatches from Other Documents
You can pull color swatches from other InDesign documents into 
a document you are working on. The following method allows you 
to choose which colors you bring into your document.
1. 
Open the Swatches panel menu and choose New Color Swatch. In the New Color Swatch 
dialog box, pick Other Library at the bottom of the Color Mode list (Visual 12–13).

2. 
Navigate to the document you want to borrow color from, and click Open. Select 
a color you want, from the list of available colors in the document, and click Add to 
transfer them to your Swatches panel. When you are done adding colors, click OK.
Loading Swatches
You can also add swatches from 
another document by using the Load 
Swatches option and then selecting 
the file. This method will load all the 
colors from the second document 
rather than letting you choose the 
ones you want (Visual 12–12).
Standard Swatch Libraries
Although it stimulates your 
creative juices to create your own 
colors from the color spectrum bar and those cool 
little CMYK sliders, the safest thing to do is choose 
colors from standard swatch libraries—like Pantone 
or Trumatch. You find the standard swatch libraries 
in the Swatch Options dialog box. First, open the 
Swatch panel menu and choose New Color Swatch (or 
Swatch Options if you have a swatch selected). When 
the dialog box opens, choose Color Mode. Each of 
the names in the center section of the list corresponds 
to a specific color swatch system (Visual 12–13).
Using a swatch book to choose colors assures that you 
are speaking the same language as your printer—as 
long as you’re both using the same swatch book. (Be 
sure to watch the Pantone video described earlier!)
Creating a Two-Color Layout
Let’s say you’re designing a small flyer for a large bank. The bank 
wants the piece to look good, but doesn’t want to spend the money 
on four colors. You suggest going with two colors on coated ivory 
paper. The finished product will look like Visual 12–14.
VISUAL |12–12 |
You will want to use the 
Load Swatches command 
when you want all the colors 
from an existing document 
to come into the document 
you are working on.
VISUAL |12–13 |
Each of the names in the 
center section (DIC Color, 
PANTONE, TRUMATCH, and so 
on) corresponds to a specific 
manufacturer’s color swatch 
system. Be sure to choose a 
system your printer uses.

1. 
Make a new document 22p × 8.5", 0.25" margins, and 0.125" full 
bleed. Delete all swatches that may be in the Swatches panel. You will 
not be able to delete [None], [Paper], [Black], or [Registration].
2. 
Choose New Color Swatch in the panel menu. In the New Color Swatch dialog box, 
choose PANTONE solid coated in the Color Mode list. Scroll down the list of available 
colors, select 202 C, and click Add. 
Now, choose Pantone metallic coated
from the Color Mode list. Scroll down 
to 876 C (or type 876 in the PANTONE 
field), select this color, click Add, and 
then click Done (Visual 12–15). You have 
selected two standard Pantone colors 
to use in your document (if you had 
a Pantone Color Swatch book, you’d 
see that 876 C is an eye-catching metallic gold).
3. 
Draw a text frame from margin to margin and place the 
12 Gibraltar Bank. docx text file. You will find the file in the 12 Artwork 
and Resources folder, on the CD accompanying this book.
4. 
Open the Paragraph Styles panel 
and choose Load All Text Styles. Find 
the 12 Gibraltar Style Sheets.indd 
file, in the same folder as the text 
file. Click OK in the Load Style dialog 
box. Select all the text and assign the 
Body Copy paragraph style. Apply 
the Headline style to the first line of 
type. Apply the Sub Head style to 
the lines “How We Protect…,” “Our 
Security…,” and “What Information….”
5. 
Apply the Body Copy-Bulleted style 
to the three bulleted paragraphs. If 
the bullets don’t display correctly, 
replace them, using Option+8

6. 
Apply the Footer style to the bottom four lines, making sure there is a soft return 
at the end of each line. Place a flush right tab (Shift+Tab) between the phone 
number and website. The text in your document should look like Visual 12–16.
7. 
Draw a rectangle that bleeds from the top, left, and right sides. Include 
just the first section of placeholder text in the rectangle (refer to 
Visual 12–14). Fill the rectangle with 876 C and send it to the back.
8. 
Make a similar rectangle at the bottom of the document, bleeding it off the right, left, 
and bottom edges. The rectangular shape should enclose the name, address, and web 
information. Fill it with 876 C and send it to the back. Deselect everything. We’ve now 
used our two colors: 876 C for the background rectangles and 202 C for the type.
9. 
Since the document will be printed on ivory paper, let’s add a color to our 
paper and see what it will look like when it is printed. Double-click the [Paper] 
color in the Swatches panel. In the Swatch Options dialog box, give the paper 
a light ivory color: 5% Cyan, 10% Magenta, 36% Yellow, 0.39% Black. Press 
Return. Save your document, and let’s try printing color separations.
Color Separations
One of the most common problems printers have, when designers bring 
in “finished” documents, is in creating color separations. Every color in 
your document needs its own plate and printing unit on the press. A two-
color document will need two plates and two printing units; a four-color 
document will need four plates and four printing units, and so on. (Tints 
based on an original spot color do not require an additional plate.)
You may think you are bringing a two-color document to your printer, but when 
he runs separations, he gets four, five, six, or more colors. Why? It could be that 
what looks like a single color on your monitor is actually a blend of CMYK or 
RGB values. It could be that you didn’t notice a hairline stroke on a text frame. 
It could be that a hidden character is assigned a color you can’t even see on 
your monitor. There can be any number of reasons why there are more colors 
in your document than it appears. The following exercise uses features in the 
Print dialog box to identify how many colors are really in your document.
1. 
Before you print separations, change the [Paper] color in the Swatches 
panel back to 0% of CMYK. Now, go to the Print dialog box. On the 
Setup page, in the Page Position field, choose Centered.

309
|   Chapter 12 |
2. 
On the Marks and Bleed page, 
select All Printer’s Marks. Be 
sure that Use Document Bleed 
Settings is selected. On the
Output page, select Separations
in the Color field (Visual 12–17).
3. 
Click Print. You should get 
two sheets from the printer, 
one labeled PANTONE 
202 C and the other labeled 
876 C. Color separations 
always print in black, 
even if you are using a color printer. Each color is “separated” onto an individual 
page, and the black areas show where the color will be printed. A color 
identification label appears outside the image area near the crop marks.
4. 
Go back to your document and deliberately confuse things. Make hidden 
characters visible and select a single hard return character. Color it black 
and run separations again. You will get a third sheet labeled Process Black, 
although you won’t see any text or element. InDesign “saw” a hidden 
character with a third color (black), that nobody else saw. Since we’re printing 
separations, it printed a black plate—just for that one invisible character.
5. 
Make a new process swatch: C=0, M=100, Y=61, K=43 (the equivalent values of 
PANTONE 202 C). Name it Process Red. Select all your text and change it to Process 
Red. The color of your text looks exactly the same, but now when you print, you 
get four separations: Magenta, Yellow, Black, and 876C. (Cyan didn’t print because 
its value was 0. Also notice how the Black plate is screened back to 43%.)
It is a good idea to print out a sample set of separations on your laser printer, 
before sending the project to the commercial printer. Printing sample separations 
is an effective way of catching color mistakes before they end up costing you 
money. Knowing a few color basics and always paying attention to how color 
is defined and used in your document will help avoid production pitfalls and 
increase your chances of being the next one in line for that promotion. Your 
documents need to be aesthetically pleasing, and technically correct.
VISUAL |12–17 |
The Output page offers choices 
for color separations.
▶ production tip
Remember the color you 
assigned to the bank flyer paper 
stock? That color did not print 
with your color separations. A 
color assigned to [Paper] is 
for your eyes only, to give you 
an approximate feel for how 
your final document will look.
Modify the paper color in your 
Swatches panel as close as 
possible to the real paper, but 
remember that your monitor 
will not give you a 100% 
match. Also keep in mind that 
a single PANTONE color may 
look different when printed 
on different color papers.

Printer’s Marks and Printing Options
You will want to be familiar with the marks your printer uses for printing 
and finishing your document. Since all printer’s marks are outside 
the copy area of the document, the paper size will always have to be 
larger than your finished document size, in order to use them.

means something different. 
The Page Information gives 
the file name on the lower

▶  Crop Marks (sometimes called trim marks) are placed just outside the four 
corners of your document and tell the cutter where to cut the paper to its 
finished size. If a document is printed on oversized paper, the cutter will trim 
away the excess according to the crop marks. You can adjust the weight and 
placement of crop marks using the Weight and Offset fields on the right side 
of the Marks area, on the Marks and Bleed page of the Print dialog box.
▶  Manual Crop Marks. If more than one copy of your document will be printed 
on a single sheet (two up, three up, and so on), or if the front and back of 
your document will be printed in a single pass (work and turn, work and 
tumble—types of imposition), you may want to draw your own crop marks 
manually. Make your manual crop marks short and thin—about a quarter 
of an inch long and hairline width—and maybe an eighth of an inch away 
from the edge of the finished piece. Make sure the corners don’t touch. 
Before you take your document to final production, it’s a good idea to 
print it from your laser printer, and with a pencil, connect the crop marks, 
you created. This is a way to double-check the accuracy of your marks, 
to make sure that you’re not cutting off something you want to keep.
▶  Bleed Marks sit in the corners of your document, just outside the crop 
marks, and set the limits of your printed bleed. You will usually use 
the settings you entered when your document was first set up, but 
you can deselect the Use Document Bleed Settings option and enter 
new settings, in the Bleed and Slug area of the Print dialog box. Even 
if the bleed in your electronic file extends beyond the settings in the 
Bleed and Slug area, it will print only out to the bleed marks.
▶  Registration Marks are the “bull’s-eyes” along the sides of your document. 
Your printer uses these marks to straighten and center your document, 
and to align multiple colors. All your hard work and great design 
ideas will go down the drain, if your job is printed out of register.
▶  Color Bars are used in production to be sure that ink coverage is running right—
not too light and not too heavy. They appear at the top of a document.
▶  Page Information will give you the title of the document, the date 
and time printed, and separation color. Very handy stuff.

By now you should understand these color basics:
▶  In offset printing, jobs are either process 
or spot color jobs. In general, the more 
colors used, the more expensive the job.
▶  The color swatch should be created according 
to its final use. If its intent is for the web, 
use: RGB, if for print, use: CMYK or Spot.
▶  Since most monitors don’t accurately display 
color, you should select color from a color swatch 
book, such as a Pantone® Color Selector.
▶  In traditional printing, each color uses a separate 
printing plate. If the job has three colors, there 
will be three printing plates. When you print 
separations, the number of separations should 
equal the number of colors used in the document.
▶  Although Black is counted as a color, tints created 
from a solid color aren’t considered additional 
colors. For instance, if you had a newsletter that 
used black and a 10%, 20%, and 50% tint of 
blue, it would still be a two-color newsletter.
▶  If you print and overlay two tints—process or 
spot color—a new color will result. A tint of 
yellow, printed over a tint of blue, will result 
in a shade of green. A tint of black printed 
over a tint of red will result in a much darker 
red. This concept is important for you to keep 
in mind, as we move on to mixed inks.
▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
Other Print Dialog Box Options
 
▶
All pages in a document are printed, by default. You can also specify a page range, 
or choose to print odd or even pages. To print a single page, enter the page number 
in the Range field. Entering “1, 4-7” in the Range field would result in printing 
pages 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7. If you entered “5-”, you would print page 5 through the 
end of the document. Entering “-5” would result in printing all pages from 
1 through page 5.
 
▶
 Under the Setup category you can scale the document by entering a percent in 
the Width or Height field. If Constrain Proportions is checked, your document 
will be scaled proportionately. Checking Scale to Fit will automatically resize your 
document to fit the paper size you have chosen.
 
▶
 You may want documents created with facing pages to print two pages, side by side, 
on one sheet of paper. This is called printing a “spread,” and you can print one 
spread per sheet. Select Spreads under the General category and then check the 
preview icon to determine if you need to change the orientation of your pages. If 
the document page size is too large, the spread won’t fit on your paper size. In this 
case, you can reduce the spread to fit on your paper by selecting Scale to Fit under 
the Setup category.
 
▶
 Any object on a document page can be specified as non-printing. First, select the 
object. Then go to Window>Output>Attributes and check Nonprinting. If desired, 
you can override this setting in the Print dialog box; in the General options, select 
Print Non-printing Objects.
 
▶
 You can save a print summary for a specific job that records all the print settings. 
Go to the Summary category, select Save Summary, and name the file. A text 
file containing all the specifications for this job will be created. This is a helpful 
checklist for the next time you need to print a complex job.

Using Mixed Inks
When you are planning on using mixed inks, it’s a good idea to check with your 
printer to identify any potential printing issues. With that said, let’s begin using 
mixed inks. First, you will create a mixed ink swatch. Then, you will generate a 
mixed ink swatch group. Finally, you will use a mixed ink swatch group in creating 
a poster for the Midwest Quilters Convention. This project will utilize many of 
the effects introduced in Chapter 11, and will incorporate a two-color palette.

1. 
Create a new InDesign document using the default settings. 
Create two spot color swatches: PANTONE solid coated 012 C 
(yellow) and PANTONE solid coated 2737 C (blue).
2. 
Open the Swatches panel. From the menu options, choose New Mixed Ink Swatch.
3. 
Click the empty boxes to the left of the PANTONE Yellow 012 C and 
PANTONE 2736 C swatch names. A mixed ink icon 
 will appear. Enter 
the percentages of each color by typing in the percentage field, or by 
dragging the sliders. The new color appears in the upper left swatch box. 
Press Return. The mixed ink swatch now appears in the Swatches panel.
You can see how using mixed ink swatches can create the illusion of a 
third color—without the additional cost. In this case, we now have blue, 
yellow, and khaki colors to use in our two-color document. Think of the 
possibilities…you could spend a considerable amount of time creating mixed 
ink swatches—or you could let InDesign automate the system for you.

2. 
Click the empty boxes to the left of PANTONE Yellow 012 C and PANTONE 2736 C. 
The mixed ink icon will appear. Carefully refer to Visual 12–22 as we move on with 
the steps. InDesign is going to automatically generate mixed ink group swatches 
from the yellow and blue spot colors in our document. In the Initial column, enter a 
percentage of each color. In Visual 12–22, a 20% tint of PANTONE Yellow 012 C and 
a 20% tint of PANTONE 2736 C would be our first and second swatches. The Repeat
column indicates how many separate swatches should be created. In this example, 
there would be the initial swatch, 
plus four more—for a total of five 
swatches of yellow, and five swatches 
of blue in increments of 20%. Click 
Preview Swatches to see how many 
swatches InDesign will create when 
you press Return. In this example, 
five tints of each color will be mixed, 
for a total of 25 swatches. Be realistic 
with the number of swatches 
you create—you probably don’t 
need to generate 100 mixed ink swatches!
Examine Visual 12–23. First, find the single 
mixed ink swatch, named “Mixed Ink 1.” Then, 
locate the 25 new mixed ink swatches. Notice 
that all mixed ink swatches are indicated with 
a light yellow and blue teardrop shape. When 
you create a document using PANTONE 
Yellow 012 C and PANTONE 2736 C and use 
all the mixed ink swatches, you will only get 
two separations, because all the colors are tint 
mixes of the yellow and blue main colors.
In the next series of steps, you’ll create a new 
mixed ink group from two spot colors and use 
your swatches to create the illustrations for the 
Midwest Quilters Convention. It is perfectly 
fine to choose different spot colors for your 
project, but remember that you should have one 
color dark enough for readable body copy.

1. Open 12 Quilt Block Template from the 
12 Artwork and Resources folder, on the 
CD, accompanying this text. Open the 
Swatches panel and create two spot colors 
for use on coated paper: PANTONE Violet C 
and PANTONE Rubine Red C. Delete all 
other colors from the Swatches panel, 
except for Rubine Red C and Violet C.
2. Create a mixed ink group, keeping the final 
number of swatches to 36 or less. Visual 12–24 
shows the importance of using the Preview 
Swatches button while creating mixed ink 
groups. Swatches 21–24 are so close in color 
that it would be easy to select the wrong color 
during production. Try to create a palette 
with a full-range of distinct color blends.
3. Fill the center square with the color of your 
choice. Then, fill all the other triangles in a 
symmetrical manner. A good technique is 
to add one fill and then use the Eyedropper 
tool to transfer the fill to other shapes 
(Visual 12–25). As you are working on your 
block, you can easily revise your color scheme 
if you find a combination that would be 
more effective. When you are satisfied with 
your quilt block, save it as Quilt Block 1.
4. 
With Quilt Block 1 still open, do a Save As and name the file Quilt 
Block 2. Revise the color scheme to make a block with a totally different 
color balance or pattern. When you are finished, save the block.
5. 
Do a Save As and name the new file Quilt Block 3. Again, revise the 
color scheme and save the finished block. Finally, save Quilt Block 3 as 
Quilt Block 4 and revise the colors. Save the finished result.
You now have four different quilt squares that will be the “building blocks” (my 
apologies) for the Midwest Quilters Convention project at the end of this chapter.

Summary
As this chapter has demonstrated, getting images and type on your document is 
just the tip of the iceberg, in terms of production. There are many ways designers 
can innocently flub up a document—and defining color incorrectly, is one of them. 
Spend some extra time experimenting with the Swatches panel, until you are 
comfortable with all of its functions.
When you send a document out to the printer, ask someone with more experience 
to look it over. Finding and fixing errors before they go to prepress is a good way to 
establish and maintain a good reputation, as a designer.
In the next chapter, you will learn about InDesign’s powerful Links and Preflight 
operations, the difference between vector and bitmap artwork, dealing with 
resolution issues, and the Separations and Overprint Preview features. This is all 
important information, critical for you to understand. Take your time and carefully 
read the chapter.

introduction
Some ideas sound good in theory—self-generating electricity, cars that run without an
external fuel source, gears that keep turning on their own momentum. But not every
great idea works out in reality.
That’s what can happen to a great design idea, too. You spend a lot of time and creative energy on 
a document—it looks beautiful on your monitor and when printed on your desktop color printer. 
So, you take it to your commercial printing company and order 5,000 printed pieces. But when 
you pick up your job, you get a bill for hundreds of dollars more than you were quoted. You’re 
told that the additional charges are for something called “prepress.” They explain that it was 
necessary to take your electronic file—the one you thought was finished—and spend additional 
time getting it ready to print properly. This chapter will explain the basic production concepts 
you need to create documents that run smoothly, and avoid unexpected budget overruns.

An Introduction to Image Management
A typical InDesign document includes text and images. The previous chapters 
have focused primarily on text: how to choose appropriate typefaces, format 
paragraphs, use hyphens and dashes, create styles, and so on. This chapter 
will focus on working with images. This chapter covers only the basic 
information required for documents destined for commercial print shops. For 
more detailed information on each topic, consult InDesign’s Help menu.
Input: Preparing Image Files for Use in InDesign
Let’s say you’re creating a fund-raising brochure for a museum’s 
building project. The copy has been written, and you have gathered 
the artwork that will be featured in the piece, including:
▶
▶An old, glossy color photograph of the museum’s founder;
▶
▶An architect’s full-color marker rendering of the proposed addition to the museum;
▶
▶A black and white printout of the new floor plan;
▶
▶A file containing a digital photograph of the current board of directors; and
▶
▶The museum logo, created in Adobe Illustrator®.
Each of these images have different production considerations. But they also 
have two things in common: input and output. You need to prepare them 
correctly during the input stage, and use appropriate production techniques, 
so that they output correctly and produce a quality printed piece.
Dots, Pixels and Lines per inch
Before we begin, you need to know how commercial printing presses reproduce 
full-color paintings, charcoal drawings, photographs, or other pieces of artwork that 
artists and photographers create. A printing press can’t blend a myriad of colors; 
it has only two options—either it puts a particular color ink, at a specific location 
on the paper, or it doesn’t. What’s the secret? With a magnifying glass, take a look 
at any color or black and white picture, in a newspaper or magazine, and you will 
see that it is composed of millions of tiny dots. Whether the dots are all black or 
various colors, the varying sizes and arrangement visually blend together and create 
the illusion of color and shading. The graphics industry uses many acronyms when 
talking about dots (in some cases, they are squares). The most important to know are: 
dots per inch (dpi), pixels per inch (ppi), and lines per inch (lpi). These terms define 
the resolution of desktop printers or scanners, digital image files and commercial 
printing presses. Resolution has a direct bearing on the capabilities of a device, or 
the quality of an image. Generally, the higher the resolution, the crisper the image.

Continuous Tone Artwork
Let’s begin with the color photo of the museum’s founder. Traditional photographs, 
taken with a film camera and printed on photographic paper, fall into the artwork 
classification known as continuous tone. Any artwork that contains a full-range 
of color or tonal values—such as paintings, black and white photographs, or 
pastel drawings—falls into this category. A scanner is used to digitize continuous 
tone artwork, so that it can be placed into an InDesign document. This process 
converts the colors and tones of the artwork into a specified number of dots per 
inch (dpi) that you determine when you set up the scan. However, the resolution 
of the resulting image file is described in pixels per inch (ppi). (When talking 
about scanners and scanned images, dpi and ppi are often used interchangeably.) 
Understanding how resolution affects the quality of the digital image and its file 
size, is critical to creating efficient and problem-free InDesign documents.
If the photo is scanned at a low resolution, there will be fewer pixels per square inch, 
and some of the detail in the photo will be lost. A photo scanned at high resolution
will retain much more detail, because there will be more pixels to record more 
information per square inch. You will need to refer to your scanner’s manual to 
find out how to adjust the scanning resolution. Generally, a photograph scanned 
at 300 dpi is sufficient for most print production needs. Once the scan of the old 
photograph is placed into the InDesign document, it can be scaled and cropped.
Next, let’s take a look at the architect’s marker rendering of the proposed 
addition. This illustration is also considered continuous tone artwork. And 
just like the color photograph, this illustration will be converted to pixels in 
the scanning process. Again, a scanning resolution of 300 is sufficient.
Line Art
The black and white printout of the floor plan falls into a different artwork 
classification called line art. Line art does not contain any tonal values—the image is 
comprised of pure black or white elements. A pen and ink or scratch board drawing 
is line art, so is pure black type printed on a laser printer. When this type of artwork is 
VISUAL |13–1 |
Continuous tone artwork (left) 
includes a full-range of tonal 
values. Line art (right) consists 
of straight and curved lines 
without variations in shade.
▶ production tip
Continuous tone artwork 
needs to be converted to 
dots by scanning, before 
it can be printed.
▶ production tip
Line art doesn’t contain 
any tonal values. It needs 
to be scanned as line art 
before it is printed.

scanned, you will select “line art” in the scanner setup controls. Your scanner’s manual 
will be able to walk you through the process. Since there are no tonal variations in the 
floor plan art, each pixel will be either a solid black or solid white square. If we choose 
a scanner resolution of 600 pixels per square inch, the pixels will be very small, and 
will capture fine details in the floor plan. This may seem fine, but the general rule of 
thumb is to capture line art at the resolution of the final print device. While 600 dpi 
is customary for today’s laser or inkjet printers, the digital presses and imagesetters 
found in many commercial printers can print at 1200, 2400 and higher dpi. If 
possible, always consult with your printer for the best scanning recommendations.
Finally, we have the digital photo of the board of directors. A digital 
photograph has already been converted to pixels. This is where the resolution 
of the digital camera comes into play. The higher the resolution setting of 
the camera, the more pixels—which then capture more detail in the photo. 
There is little you can do to improve the overall quality of a digital image 
taken with a low resolution camera, because the camera did not capture 
enough pixels to record the nuances of the photo in the first place.
Resolution Independent and Resolution Dependent Artwork
We have one more piece of artwork to discuss before we begin our museum fund-
raising piece—the museum logo. This logo was created in Adobe Illustrator®, one 
of the members in the Creative Suite. Adobe Illustrator is a drawing program 
that uses mathematical equations to create precise, curved and straight paths 
that extend from point to point. This type of digital artwork is vector-based 
artwork. The paths can be edited by repositioning the points. As the points are 
rearranged, the mathematical data is recalculated, and the path is updated. This 
type of digital artwork is resolution independent, which means that the image 
quality is not adversely affected, regardless of how the artwork is scaled. Native 
Illustrator files (with the file extension .ai) can be placed directly into InDesign.
VISUAL |13–2 |
The “dots” that make up digital 
photos, are picture elements, 
or pixels. These give the 
impression of continuous tones. 
The photo on the right has been 
enlarged to show the pixels.

Bitmap (Raster) Images
The other images in our museum piece were not created by mathematical formulas, 
so instead of being vector-based artwork, they are called bitmap or raster images. 
During the scanning or digital photography process, the images were converted to 
pixels, which are bits of data that are mapped to a grid of rows and columns. When 
these pixels are small enough, they create the illusion of a continuous tone image. In 
contrast to vector images (which are resolution independent), images composed of 
pixels are said to be resolution dependent. What this means is the size of the individual 
pixels will get larger or smaller as the image is scaled in InDesign. Unfortunately, 
the quality of bitmap images may deteriorate. As shown in Visual 13–2, greatly 
enlarging a bitmap image will make its individual pixels visible to the human eye.
The term resolution is used to describe the number of pixels in each square inch of 
the image. The images for the museum project, scanned at a resolution of 300 pixels 
per inch (ppi), resulted in a resolution of 90,000 incredibly tiny pixels, per square 
inch (300 pixels wide by 300 pixels high). The architectural floor plan was scanned 
at 600 ppi, resulting in 360,000 data-filled pixels, in each square inch! Let’s compare 
that to a piece of line art with a resolution of 72 ppi. With only 5,184 total pixels 
per square inch (72 × 72 = 5184), the physical size of each individual pixel would 
be much larger than the 360,000 microscopic pixels, per square inch, in the floor 
plan scan. The larger pixel size would result in a coarser, less-detailed image when 
printed. So when it comes to bitmap images, fewer or larger pixels, per inch = less 
data = less detail. More tiny pixels, per square inch = more data = more detail. So, 
why not input everything at 1200 ppi? Because the file sizes would be enormous 
and your files would be difficult to output—which brings us to the next topic.
From Input to Output: Using Images in InDesign
Quality designs, like the museum brochure, start with careful planning. Usually 
a detailed layout is worked out that determines how an image will be used, 
such as where, how large, and what portion of it will be used in the piece. If 
all these details are known before the artwork is converted to bitmap images, 
it will be easy to create optimal scans. For example, the entire 8×10 photo of 
the founder need not be scanned, if only his head and shoulders will be used. 
Perhaps a portion of the architect’s marker rendering will need to be enlarged 
considerably. Producing the most efficient bitmap image files means setting up 
the scanner to: 1) the correct dpi setting for the final printing device, 2) capture 
only the portions needed and 3) scale them to final size needed in the document.
But during the production process, when layouts and copy changes often 
occur, the size and cropping of images need to be changed—sometimes 
drastically. What affect will this have on your various images?
▶ production tip
Bitmap images are resolution 
dependent, which means 
the quality of the image may 
change as the image is scaled.
▶ production tip
Resolution describes the 
number of pixels in each 
square inch of an image.

|  Production Essentials |
326
For resolution independent, vector artwork—like the museum’s logo—you don’t 
need to worry about scaling and its effects on image quality. These types of images 
will print beautifully at almost any size. 
However, scaling is a major concern when 
using pixel-based, resolution dependent 
images. In Visual 13–3, the photo is a low-
resolution, 72 ppi image, which has also 
been scaled larger in InDesign. Not only 
does this low-resolution image start out 
with larger pixels and less data, as the image 
size increased, the size of each pixel has 
also increased. The result is a blurry photo 
with huge pixels, and very little detail.
In contrast, Visual 13–4 shows a high-
resolution, 300 ppi photo, used at its 
actual size in the InDesign document. 
The pixels remain imperceptible, and 
the detail in the image is crisp, right 
down to the drool on the knuckles.
The keys to having bitmap 
images print correctly are:
▶
Begin with the correct resolution; and
▶
 Use images at 100% in the 
InDesign document.
Next, you’ll learn how the Links panel, in partnership with Adobe 
Photoshop®, can optimize bitmap images, so that they are the 
ideal size and resolution for your InDesign document.
The Links Panel
When you place an image in InDesign, it creates and then maintains a link
to the original source file. The Links panel displays information about all 
the files linked to your document. The Links panel is accessed by pressing 
Shift+Command+D (Mac) or Shift+Control+D (Windows). You can also 
access the Links panel by going to Window>Links. When you choose Panel 
Options from the Links panel menu, you can customize the information that 
will be displayed in the Links panel. The numbers in Visual 13–5, identify 
important information that can be displayed in the Links panel. Each numbered 
item is explained on the next few pages. If your Links panel does not look the 
same, follow the instructions at the end of the section to customize it.

1 Embedded and Linked images. When an image is placed into InDesign, the 
graphic can either be linked or embedded. By default, InDesign creates linked 
graphics. This means that data from the graphic file is not brought into the 
document—instead, InDesign simply creates a link to the image’s original source file. 
Later, during printing, it retrieves the data needed to generate the image. InDesign 
continually monitors all linked source files to determine if they have been modified 
or moved. If you place an image from a CD and then remove the CD, the link is 
broken because InDesign can’t follow the path to the original image file. Similarly, if 
you place images that were located in a specific folder and later change the location 
or name of the folder, the links to all those source files are broken. If the link to an 
image is broken, at print time, InDesign warns you. If you cannot fix the link, it will 
print the low-res image displayed on your monitor. This poor quality image is not 
what you want when printed on a high quality commercial press. For this reason, all 
links must be in place before printing your project. When you take a project to the 
printer, you must include all graphics and font files. (Fortunately, InDesign has a 
feature that will “package” your project correctly, notifying you of any problems. This 
process will be covered later in this chapter.)
When you embed an image, the data from the image file becomes part of the 
InDesign file and is displayed with a special icon in the Status column of the 
VISUAL |13–5 |
The Links panel shows 
information that is critical for 
successfully using images in 
your project. It is important to 
spend some time learning the 
features of this powerful panel.

Links panel, as shown in callout #1 in Visual 13–5. Your InDesign file will be 
much larger with embedded images, but you won’t need to worry about broken 
links when you take your project to the printer. However, most printers prefer 
that graphics files not be embedded in InDesign documents. This is a production 
issue you should discuss with your printer before production begins!
2 Actual ppi. Visual 13–5 shows the Actual ppi column turned on to display in the 
upper portion of the Links panel. When you scan down the far right column, you can 
quickly see the resolution at which each image was scanned. Each image has an 
Actual ppi resolution of 300. If scaled to 100%, these images would be ideal for 
printing in full-color on printing press.
3  Effective ppi. As you click on each link in the upper portion of the Links panel, 
the Link Info pane at the bottom, will display image-specific data, including the 
image’s scale percentage and the Effective ppi. Visual 13–5 also shows the Effective 
ppi column turned on to display in the upper part of the Links panel.
Unlike the numbers in the Actual ppi column, the numbers in the Effective ppi 
column are not all the same. Look at the middle two links, Boy.psd and Crocodile. psd.
The Effective and Actual ppi for both these links are 300, because both images are 
used at 100% in the InDesign document. This is the ideal scenario. Now, look at the 
Link Info pane area for Kangaroos.psd (Visual 13–5). Notice that the Scale category 
shows 43.3%. Because the image has been reduced, the pixels were squeezed together 
to fit into a much smaller space. Although we began with an Actual resolution of 
300 ppi, the Effective resolution has now increased to 693 ppi, more than twice the 
ideal of 300 ppi. Now, look at the link for the Native.psd image. Even though the 
Actual ppi is 300, the Effective ppi is 75—much less than the ideal resolution. Why? 
Because the image was scaled to 400% in the document. So, the Effective ppi was

reduced by scaling the image larger. Remember, when the Effective ppi is lower 
than the ideal resolution, you will begin to have problems with image quality. When 
working on documents intended for high quality, commercial printing, you want to 
keep the Effective ppi at the ideal, 300 ppi resolution. You’ll learn how to do that next.
4  Edit Original. Often, after placing and scaling images in InDesign, the Effective 
ppi is too high, or too low. In the following exercise, you will learn how to use Adobe 
Photoshop® in conjunction with InDesign to remedy this situation. (If you don’t have 
Photoshop, study the visuals in the following steps.)
1. 
From the 13 Artwork and Resources 
folder on the accompanying CD, 
open the file 13 Resolution. indd. 
inside the 13 Resolution folder. 
As the file opens, you will see 
this warning message. Since 
you will use the Links panel to locate missing links, you can choose Don’t Fix.
2. 
Open the Links panel. Click on 
Kangaroos.psd, and read the Link 
Info underneath. Notice that the 
Kangaroos. psd link has been 
scaled down to 43.3%, creating 
an Effective ppi of 693, which is 
unnecessarily too high. In the lower 
right corner of the Links panel, click 
the Edit Original icon (Visual 13–6).
3. 
 Adobe Photoshop should 
launch, opening the 
Kangaroos.psd source file. When 
it opens, go to the menu and 
select Image>Image Size. At 
the bottom of the window, 
check Resample Image. In the 
Document Size section, Choose 
Percent, next to the Width and 
Height fields. Enter 43.3 in 
the Width field, and the same 
value should automatically transfer to the Height field (Visual 13–7). Click OK. When 
you resample an image, you actually change the number of pixels in it. In this case, 
there were too many pixels per inch, so we had Photoshop eliminate the extra data.

4.  Save the Photoshop file. Now 
look at the Links panel, and you 
will notice that the Effective and 
Actual ppi are both 300. InDesign 
automatically updated the link 
with the revisions you made 
in Photoshop. (Visual 13–8).
5. Select the Native.psd file in the 
Links panel. Notice that a PB appears 
in the Page column of the Links panel. PB means that the image is on the pasteboard, 
not on the document (Visual 13–9). If the document had many pages, it might be hard 
to find exactly where the image was located; but if you look in the Link Info section, 
the Page category shows PB:1. This means the image is on the pasteboard of page 1.
This link has a problem—an Effective ppi of 75. If you look at the Link Info you will 
see that the image has been scaled to 400%. Each pixel has increased in size to fill the 
space. Choose Edit Original and the Photoshop file will open. Go to the menu and 
select Image>Image Size. In the Pixel Dimension section of the window, notice that 
there are 557 pixels in the width, and 565 in the height. Now, with Resample Image 
checked, change the Document Size Width and Height fields to 400%. Before you click 
OK, notice how resampling has greatly increased the values in the Pixel Dimensions 
Width and Height fields of Photoshop’s Image Size window. Save the Photoshop 
file, but don’t close your document—we need it for the next few techniques!
VISUAL |13–8 |
The Actual and Effective ppi 
are 300 because the image 
is used at its actual size.
VISUAL |13–9 |
Pixels are visible in this 
image. Enlarging the image 
has created an Effective ppi 
of only 75, significantly below 
the ideal 300 ppi. We will 
use Photoshop to resample 
and remedy the situation.

5  Relink Image. A question mark inside a red circle 
 on the Links panel 
means that the link pathway is broken. This scenario happens frequently—somehow, 
the original file for an image is not where it is supposed to be. (Later in this chapter, 
you will learn about the Package function that takes care of this issue.) Broken links 
happen anytime the pathway to the original graphic file has been changed, after the 
link was initially established in InDesign. If you are placing images from the CD 
included with this book, and then remove the CD, you will receive a missing link 
message when you attempt to print the document. Suppose you had several images 
on your desktop that you placed into an InDesign document. After saving the 
document, you decide to organize things by moving all the image files into a folder 
labeled with the job name. The next time you open the document, every link will be 
displayed with a broken link icon because the files are not in their original location 
and InDesign can’t reestablish the link. Fortunately, the Links panel makes it easy to 
relink the image to the new location. To reestablish a single link, simply select the 
filename with the missing link icon and click the Relink icon on the bottom of the 
Links panel. When the dialog box opens, locate the graphics file and select it. When 
you have many missing links, you can Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) + click the 
Relink icon to relink multiple image files.
6. 
Click on the Boy.psd file name in the Links panel. Click the Relink icon below 
the Links panel. Navigate to the 13 Artwork and Resources folder on the 
accompanying CD. Select the Boy2.psd, located inside the folder. Look in the 
Links panel and you will see that the link is now intact. Save the document.

6  Update Link. A yellow triangle
means that the original image file has been 
changed since it was placed in the document. When a job is sent out to the printer, the 
Status column shouldn’t display any links that need updating, or that are missing. In 
this last exercise, you’ll update a link, so that all the links are ready to go to the printer.
7. 
Place 13 InDesign Sample File.indd into your open document. The file is found in the 
13 Resolution folder. Save the exercise. Now, use InDesign to open and modify the 
13 InDesign Sample File .indd. Change the color of the type to Magenta and save and 
close the document. Since an attribute of the link has been changed since it was placed 
in the document, a yellow triangle appears in the status column. Click the Update Link 
icon at the bottom of the Links panel to update to the most current file. (Visual 13–10).
The Links panel menu offers many options. In 
those rare instances when you want to embed 
an image file, you choose Embed Link from the 
panel menu. When a link is embedded, the link 
data becomes part of your InDesign document.
To customize the information you would like 
to have displayed in the upper and lower halves 
of the Links panel, open the panel menu and 
choose Panel Options. Visual 13–12A shows 
the Panel Options modified to display Color 
Space and Scale. In Visual 13–12B, Color 
Space and Scale are now displayed in the upper 
half of the Links panel. This is a convenient, 
timesaving feature, because you can view 
important production information for all your links, instead of selecting each 
link and reading its link information in the lower half of the Links panel.

Package the Document for Printing Output
When your document is ready to go to press, you need to collect all the electronic 
elements of your file—all fonts and graphics—and bundle them up for transporting 
to your service bureau or printer. Fortunately, InDesign makes this process quick 
and painless with the Package function. Choose File>Package to access the Package 
dialog box. The Summary page appears first, telling you how many fonts, colors, 
and graphics are included, and other document information. If an element is 
missing or needs your attention, there will be a yellow caution icon in front of it.
Visual 13–13 shows a problem with Links and Images. Seven images in the 
document use RGB color space. Images composed of Red, Blue and Green 
need to be converted to CMYK in Photoshop, before going to press.

The Panel Options dialog box 
allows you to choose the 
information that is displayed in 
the upper and lower halves of 
the panel. In this example, panel 
options have been modified 
to display the color space 
and scale in the upper half.

If there is a caution icon next to the Fonts summary paragraph, click on the Fonts 
category in the list on the left. The Fonts page lists the names of all fonts used in the 
document and their status will be displayed. If a font is marked as Incomplete, it 
means that although the font shows on the screen, the font file required for printing 
is missing. You will need to reinstall the font. If a font is listed as Missing, it means 
the font used in the document is not installed on your computer, and you will need 
to purchase it. These types of font problems can occur when opening files created 
on other computers. Don’t simply replace the font with another font of the same 
name, because fonts purchased from different vendors will have differences in 
font design, letter shape, and spacing. Visual 13–14 shows a sample of Garamond 
from two different digital type manufacturers. The point sizes and weights of each 
sample are identical. But, look at the differences in the overall color, letter width, 
the design of the capital G’s and the shape of the bowls. Substituting a typeface 
with the same name, but from different manufacturers is generally not a perfect 
match, and will usually result in the copy reflowing, which can be disastrous!
If you are unable to locate the correct typeface, you may need to replace it throughout 
the document. You can replace fonts in the Package dialog box by selecting the Find 
Font button. In the upper half of the Find Font dialog, select the font you want to 
replace. Then choose the replacement font in the lower half. You can then choose to 
replace the fonts one occurrence at a time, or all at once. (Font replacement can also 
be performed by selecting Type>Find Font.) Whenever you replace fonts, you need 
to proof your document again, to make sure none of the text has shifted position.

different manufacturers

Like the Links panel, the Package feature also provides the status of Links and 
Images. If the original file has been moved since the file was created, InDesign 
needs help finding the new path to the image. Click on the missing image and click 
Relink. InDesign will lead you through the navigation necessary to find the source 
file. Again, if the original graphic is not on your computer, you will have to find 
the CD it came from and pop it into your machine. The Package feature summary 
won’t alert you of any RGB files that are contained in Illustrator or PDF files. Those 
files will need to be opened in the original application and changed accordingly.
When you have remedied any problems, select the Package, button, and 
InDesign will collect all the fonts and images used to build the document. You 
will be asked to save the document and will have the opportunity to provide 
printing instructions (Visual 13–16). Next, all the elements required to print 
your job are saved in one, organized folder, that you can send to your printer.
The project’s done, you’ve packaged it, and it is all ready to go to the printer. But 
wait—you just realized that you forgot to check spelling one final time. Since 
your document is still open, you run spell check and find three spelling errors 
that would have appeared in the final version. Whew! That was close. You save 
your document, feeling relieved that you remembered this crucial production 
step. But guess what—you haven’t fixed the spelling on the InDesign document 
that’s packaged and ready to go to the printer! When you package a project, 
the components that go into the folder—the InDesign file, links, and fonts—
are actually duplicates. Once the packaging operation has been completed, any 
changes you make to the original working document requires you to either 
repackage the entire job, or replace the InDesign document in the packaged 
folder with your revised version. This scenario is usually what has happened 
when my students say, “I can’t believe there are still spelling errors! I know I 
ran spell check and caught those mistakes before I turned in that project!”

Instructions form during 
the Package operation

project information your 
printer may need.

James Wamser, Senior Training 
Specialist, Sells Printing Company, 
has over 18 years experience in the 
graphic arts industry. James provides 
training and technical support 
for Sells’ customers, as well as its 
prepress department. James has been 
working with Adobe InDesign prior to 
the release of version 1.0, and is an InDesign instructor at 
Waukesha County Technical College.
WAMSER’S ESSENTIAL PREPRESS TIPS
InDesign CS5 offers powerful tools for the 
creative professional as well as the prepress 
specialist. The following tips, will help you 
identify and prevent potential problems, when 
preparing your files for commercial printing.
▶ Preflighting is a process that examines a file 
for potential printing problems. This process will 
look at many issues including: color use, resolution, 
and font issues. Every printer has unique printing 
specifications. These requirements are called 
preflight profiles. You can create preflight profiles 
yourself, or better yet, ask your commercial printer 
to provide them for you. The image below shows 
the Preflight profile that Sells Printing Company 
in New Berlin, Wisconsin, provides to customers.
When enabled, CS5 provides a continual 
preflight status update in the bottom left 
corner of the document window.
The preflight function checks for numerous production 
issues, and notifies you of problems including any 
low resolution images, bleed issues and live area 
concerns (meaning the images or type are too 
close to the trim edge). If an error appears, open 
the Preflight panel to identify and remedy the 
situation. Sending out errorless files saves time 
and money, and keeps production on schedule.
▶ Rich Black is a defined color used in full-
color printing and is composed of 60% Cyan, 
40% Magenta, 20% Yellow, and 100% Black. The 
advantage of creating and using a rich black swatch 
is that the final print will show a black that is more 
opaque. However, rich black is a different color 
than Process Black. When you are using InDesign, 
the application preference is set to display all blacks 
as rich black. You should change this application 
preference so that you can see where Process Black 
and rich black are used in your document. Choose 
Display All Blacks Accurately in Preferences.

▶ The Separations Preview Panel is one I use all 
the time. (Window>Output>Separations Preview). This 
panel serves several purposes: It allows you to see 
all the inks used in a document (CMYK + spot inks). 
It also shows you the percentages of inks used in 
images and type. This is useful when verifying that 
a large solid black area contains rich black (CMYK).
In Chapter 12, you learned how to print 
separations to verify the number of colors in 
your document. Using Separations Preview, verify 
the individual colors used in your document by 
clicking the eye next to each color swatch.
▶ Find Font. Fonts have a history of causing reflow 
and output issues. (That’s one of the reasons why 
so many people have embraced the PDF workflow.) 
Anytime you see text highlighted with pink in your 
document, it means the required font is missing 
on your computer. The Find Font dialog box 
automatically pops up before printing to alert you 
of any problems. This dialog box will tell you how 
many fonts are used, notify you of any missing 
fonts, and give you the opportunity to replace fonts 
as necessary. Please be aware that you can access 
Find Font at any time by going to Type>Find Font.
▶ Exporting PDFs. PDF is an acronym for Portable 
Document Format, and was developed by Adobe 
Systems in 1993. PDF files can be opened and 
printed by Adobe Acrobat. In InDesign, you 
can export a file to a PDF, and it will retain 
its overall layout, fonts, and hyperlinks.
PDF files, when prepared correctly, streamline the 
printing process while providing more consistent 
and reliable results. They eliminate delays due to 
missing components such as fonts, images and 
graphics. Using PDF files in printing is referred 
to as PDF workflow. Printers who use the PDF 
workflow have individual specifications for how 
a PDF file should be prepared. It is important to 
communicate with your printer to create a PDF 
Preset that will contain the specifications required 
for the job. Once you create the settings, they are 
saved for future use, and you can export them, 
eliminating the need to recreate them on each 
computer. Our Sells Printing preset is shown below.
To create a PDF Preset, choose Adobe PDF Presets> 
Define from the File menu. Or, you can use one 
of the default PDF presets. For instance, if you are 
e-mailing a PDF of an InDesign document to show a 
concept to a client, you should select Smallest File

Size. Notice the three 
PDF/X presets in the 
list. The PDF/X presets 
are standards created 
to eliminate many 
common output issues. 
PDF/X-4 is the newest 
standard. As shown below, you can begin with the 
basic settings in any of these standards and then 
customize it for your printer’s specific needs. You 
can see why it is so important to work closely with 
your printer when selecting or creating PDF presets.
When I create PDF presets, I don’t rely on the 
document bleed settings in the InDesign document; 
I create a bleed in the preset just in case the person 
who set up the InDesign document did not include 
them. This leads to the next prepress tip…
▶ Build Bleeds. As you know, a bleed is any image 
or object that extends to the edge of a page. During 
the printing process, the document is printed on 
oversized paper, with the bleed images extending 
beyond the trim size. After the ink has dried, the 
project is cut down to size, leaving crisp images that 
run out to the edge. When creating a new document 
or document preset, you need to enter a bleed 
amount of 0.125" ( 1⁄8") on each side with a bleed. 
This will create guides indicating where the bleed 
should extend. This area is outside the final size of 
the document. Each page element that bleeds must 
extend out to the bleed guide. Without bleed guides, 
InDesign won’t recognize any part of an image 
that extends beyond the document’s trim edge.
You can add a bleed to your document at any time 
during production. Go to File>Document Setup 
and enter 0.125" on each edge with a bleed.
This is an example of 
a full-bleed document 
because color extends 
to all four edges. Add a 
bleed on all four sides!

▶ MOVING TOWARD MASTERY
▶ Use Overprint Preview. There are many ways 
colors interact with each other in a document. 
First, they can be printed next to each other. When 
colors are printed right next to each other, the press 
operator is going to make sure the colors are exactly 
aligned. When they are, the job is in register. When 
the colors are a hairline distance apart, the job 
is said to have tight register. Four-color process 
printing, with each separate plate composed of 
a series of dots, has extremely tight register.
Another way colors interact is to have one color 
knock out the other. This means that the top object 
cuts away any color beneath it. In Example A, below, 
the yellow circle has been placed on top of the blue 
box. Example B shows how the images would actually 
be printed. The yellow circle has been pulled aside to 
show that the blue area underneath is gone. This is a 
simulation of how a knock out works. By default, all 
colors except black knock out the colors underneath.
Colors can also overprint each other. When colors 
overprint, the ink goes on top of the color below, 
but does not knock it out. By default, black always 
overprints other colors. Then, how do you create an 
area of overlapping colors? The Attributes panel.
You were introduced to the Attributes panel in 
Chapter 12, and its capability to apply Nonprinting 
to image or text, preventing the object from being 
printed. In the Attributes panel you can set an 
object’s fill or stroke color to overprint, rather 
than using the default knockout setting. The 
picture above shows that the circle has now been 
assigned “Overprint Fill” on the Attributes panel.
You know that the area where the colors 
intersect should look be a different color. But 
you can’t really tell how it will look…or can you? 
Overprint Preview is a great feature found under 
the View menu. As shown below, you will see 
just how the colors will look when printed.
The ability to see how an image or object will 
overprint right on screen is a huge time saver and can 
help you identify any problems before a single proof 
is made. By the way, when you open the Separations 
Preview panel and select Separations in the View 
menu, Overprint Preview is automatically enabled.
One last word—each print shop has its own set 
of technical specifications. Prepress managers are 
available to answer your questions. Make use of 
their expertise during your production process!

Summary
The biggest thing you have probably learned from this chapter is that there is 
much more to document preparation than simply dropping in text and images!
The chapter began with input issues, describing the production considerations 
for a variety of artwork. You know the difference between continuous tone, and 
line artwork. You know that raster or bitmap images are composed of picture 
elements, called pixels, and are resolution dependent. Vector images are created 
by mathematical formulas, and are resolution independent. You know that 
image resolution describes how many pixels are contained in an image. And 
you know that the more pixels in the image, the more detail will be recorded. 
Finally, since printing presses cannot do shading, continuous tone artwork 
must be converted to a series of dots that will create the illusion of shading.
On the output side, we discussed the difference between Actual and 
Effective ppi. Although you may have started with a bitmap image with 
appropriate Actual resolution, the Effective output resolution is changed 
by scaling, during the production process. You used Photoshop to 
resample and resize raster images to achieve ideal Effective ppi.
InDesign’s powerful Package operation was discussed, and you saw first-
hand, that it can be disastrous to make last-minute font substitutions—
even if the replacement font has the same name as the original!
There’s a lot to know about production and we’ve just scratched the surface. As a 
new designer, you will have fewer errors if you follow these production steps:
1. 	 Format document size, margins, and columns.
2. 	 Add text insets and align strokes if necessary.
3. 	 Place and size graphics. Specify spot or CMYK color.
4. 	 Do the typing or place all the text.
5. 	 Add paragraph formatting.
6. 	 Add character formatting and glyphs.
7. 	 Proof carefully and print. Proof again.
8. 	 Make a folded or trimmed mock-up, if necessary.
9. 	 Check the images in the Links panel.

PIRATES, WHALERS, AND TORTOISES
The Galápagos were 
discovered in 1535 by Fray 
Tomás de Berlanga. Although 
this was an era of Spanish 
exploration and discovery, de 
Berlanga was no explorer—he 
was the Bishop of Panama. De 
Berlanga found these islands 
when his ship was carried west 
by currents His ship had only a 
two-day supply of water, and 
after finding no fresh water on 
the first two islands, two men 
and ten horses died of thirst.
In his report to the King of 
Spain, de Berlanga named 
the islands “Galápagos” for 
its unique giant tortoises.
The Galápagos were 
strategically located between 
the newly conquered Inca 
Empire of the Andes and 
Panama and Mexico, the 
center of Spanish activity 
in the New World. As Spain 
grew wealthier and more 
powerful, European rivals 
became uneasy. England, in 
particular, gave her blessing 
to pirates and buccaneers 
who attacked the Spanish 
galleons, returning to Spain. 
Buccaneer Cove, on the 
northwest end of Santiago, 
was one of the few places 
to find fresh water. Another 
valuable commodity was fresh 
meat—found in the form of 
giant tortoises. They were 
highly prized by mariners 
because they could stay alive 
in the hold for many months 
without food or water. 
By 1790 the threat posed 
by pirates was replaced by 
whaling expeditions. British 
sea captain, James Colnett 
visited the islands in 1793 
and 1794 and made the 
first accurate map. He set 
up a “Post Office Barrel” on 
Floreana. Whalers who were 
at sea for years, would leave 
letters in the barrel, and 
ships returning to England 
would deliver them to port. 
Between pirates and whalers, 
the native Galápagos tortoise 
population was depleted 
by upwards of 200,000 by 
the end of the 19th century.  
By the time of Darwin’s 
visit in 1835, tortoises 
were already disappearing 
from Floreana. By 1846, no 
tortoises could be found.

VOLCANOES
The Galápagos are volcanic islands located on the equator 
600 miles west of the South American coast. The Galápagos 
Islands are located above the Nazca Plate. It is theorized 
that these volcanoes are the result of a mantle plume, a 
column of hot rock that rise from deep within the earth. 
During this semester abroad, students will study two 
distinct types of volcanoes. In the east, smaller shield 
volcanoes with gentle slopes dot the landscape. In the 
west, on the islands of Isabela and Fernandina, students 
will explore large volcanoes with their distinctive, deep 
calderas, known as “inverted soup bowl” morphology.
Geological scientists, Dean Flowers, Steven Swanson, Dina Vees, 
and David Pipp will present at class sessions at Darwin Station 
and on site on Isabela, Santa Fé, and Fernandina islands. 
Students will be required to wear sturdy hiking shoes 
and sunglasses on all outdoor expeditions.

SCUBA DIVING
Underwater Galápagos can be as exciting and interesting as Galápagos ashore. You must be 
a certified and experienced diver to dive in Galápagos. Strong currents. sea swells, surges, 
cool waters, combined with locations along cliff faces of off-shore rocks and pinnacles 
make each dive an adventure. Divers share the water with sea lions, marine iguanas, sea 
turtles, penguins, angel fish, and many species of fish including hammerhead sharks.

introduction
Twenty years ago if you wanted to buy a comfortable family car, you more than 
likely bought a four-door sedan. If you wanted to haul cargo, you bought a pickup 
truck or full-size van. Both did a good job for their particular purposes.
Then someone asked the perfect question: Why not combine the two? And the minivan 
was born! It was the perfect way for the whole family to go to Grandma’s, and just the 
right vehicle for picking up a few sheets of 4' × 8' drywall for that weekend project 
in the utility room. The minivan changed the course of the U.S. auto industry and has 
proven to be one of the most successful innovations in American transportation.
InDesign has combined the digital page capability of an electronic publishing program and the 
creative artistry of a drawing program into the most successful innovation in graphics software 
today. The extraordinary page layout features of InDesign are the reason this program is taking the 
world by storm. But with the addition of many drawing features, similar to those you’ll find in Adobe 
Illustrator, you now have a tool that—like the minivan—is changing the face of an entire industry.
If you have already worked with Adobe Illustrator, much of this chapter will be a review of what 
you already know. Have fun, while combining your drawing skills with the good typography 
and digital page layout principles you have been learning in Exploring Adobe InDesign CS5.

Graphics Tools
You already know how to use the Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon tools to create 
two-dimensional shapes, and the Line tool for—well—lines. You know that 
the Shift key will constrain shapes to perfect squares or circles, and lines to 
increments of 45 degrees. You know that if you hold down the Option or Alt key 
while you drag, you will draw a shape from its center instead of from a corner.
In the following exercise, you will learn to make a shape by 
specifying dimensions numerically in a dialog box.
1. 
Make an 8.5" × 11" document (with the ruler set to inches) and select either 
the Rectangle or Ellipse tool (not the Polygon tool). Put the cursor where you 
want the upper left corner of the shape positioned and click (do not drag).
2. 
The dialog box for creating the Rectangle or Ellipse will appear. Enter 
Width and Height dimensions in the fields and click OK.
3. 
Do this a few times to make several different-sized shapes. If you hold 
down the Option key (Mac) or Alt key (Windows) when you click on 
your document, the shape will be centered on that point.
4. 
Use the Direct Selection tool and drag one of the points of a shape. You 
can distort the shape any way you want it. Click+drag on a line segment 
and move it around without moving the rest of the shape. Select different 
combinations of points and line segments by dragging a marquee, or 
Shift+clicking. See what kinds of weird shapes you can make.
The Mighty Pen Tool
One of the most versatile tools in the 
InDesign arsenal is the Pen tool. For 
some, it can also be a difficult one 
to master. I sat in my first Illustrator 
class for hours, trying to figure out 
why my shapes never ended up the 
way I intended them to look. But 
once I mastered the Pen tool, it 
became one of my favorite tools.

|  Chapter 14 |
Making a Closed Path
Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon tools make closed paths—their paths are 
unbroken. If you were to break a line segment or anchor point on the 
path, they would become open shapes. Paths are made up of a series of 
line segments, which can be either curved or straight. These line segments 
are connected by anchor points, which can be either corners or smooth. 
With the Pen tool you can create both open and closed paths.
1. 
Delete the shapes you made in your document and select the Pen tool. (As with every 
tool, always use the keyboard shortcut—in this case press P.) Set the Stroke color to 
Black, the Width to 1 pt., with no fill. Place your cursor about two inches, in and two 
inches down, in your document (X: 2 and Y: 2). Notice that the Pen cursor has a little “x” 
by it. This means that the path you are about to draw begins a new shape. Hold down 
Shift, click+drag horizontally to the right, about an inch. Release the mouse, then the 
Shift key. As you were dragging, two direction handles appeared: one following the 
cursor and the other extending 180 degrees in the opposite direction (Visual 14–3). 
These direction handles are like a teeter-totter, pivoting on your anchor point. The 
direction handles are not part of the actual line segment you are drawing; they only 
point you in the direction the path will be going when you begin your next stroke. So 
far, you have only established an initial anchor point for the first segment of your shape.

2. 
When you release the mouse and the Shift key, the little × next to the Pen 
cursor disappears. This means that the next stroke of your pen will be “step two” 
in creating your path. Place the cursor at coordinate X: 4 and Y: 1. Again, 
click, Shift+drag horizontally to the right, for about an inch. When you release 
the mouse and the Shift key, your path should look like Visual 14–4. You now 
have two anchor points and the first curved line segment of your shape.
3. 
Place your cursor at these coordinates: X: 6; Y: 2. Click, Shift+drag horizontally 
to the right, for about an inch, before releasing the mouse and the Shift 
key. You now have a path that looks like a bell curve (Visual 14–5).
Direction handles for drawing tools are like hidden characters when you 
are working with text. They are not part of your shape and do not print, 
but they determine much of what your path will look like. Direction 
handles and anchor points—like hidden characters—give you a critical 
advantage: They allow you to see your document as the computer sees it.
Holding the Shift key while you drag with the Pen tool will constrain 
your direction handles to increments of 45 degrees, just as it does 
with the Line tool. Press Shift after you begin to drag. Holding Shift 
continuously may send your path in unexpected directions.

|  Chapter 14  |
Maybe someday you’ll be in the middle of drawing a shape and you get 
distracted doing something else. When you get back to your path, the little 
× has reappeared next to your Pen icon. (You don’t want this because it 
means you will begin a new path instead of continuing on the same one 
you were working on.) To get rid of the little ×, place your cursor over the 
last anchor point you made and the × will change to a little slash. Click and 
you are now ready to continue with the next line segment of your path.
4. 
Apply a fill color to the path. Notice that you can fill a path that is not closed. An 
imaginary straight line, from the starting anchor point to the ending anchor point, is used 
as the boundary for the fill. Remove the fill, before you continue, by applying [None].
5. 
Place your cursor at X: 4 and Y: 3. This time, instead of dragging, simply click. You 
have established a new anchor point, but notice that the path is sharply curved at 
the previous point (Visual 14–6). The direction handle—extending further to the 
right—told this new line segment to continue on to the right, but your new anchor 
point told it to go the opposite direction: down and to the left. Choose Undo.
6. 
This time hold down the Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) key and your 
Pen tool will turn into the Convert Direction Point tool (Visual 14–7).

7. 
Click on the right end of the last direction handle you made and drag it down 
so that X: 5 and Y: 2.5 and release the mouse button (Visual 14–8).
8. 
Release the Option or Alt key and the Pen tool is active again. Place your cursor at 
approximately X: 4, Y: 3, click and release. Your new path now has a crisp corner at the 
previous anchor point (Visual 14–9). Your converted direction handle told the path to go 
down and to the left, and your new point also told the path to go down and to the left.
9. 
Move the Pen tool to the first anchor point you made for your path. (Always check 
to see that there is no little “×” or slash next to your Pen tool cursor.) When you get 
close to the starting anchor point, a small circle should appear next to the Pen tool 
cursor. This means that your path will be closed with your next click. Go ahead and 
click to close your path. It should look something like Visual 14–10. Now, apply a fill 
to your path. Practice applying different colors to the fill, as well as applying [None].

Making an Open Path
You made your first open path 
in Chapter 11, working with 
text on a path. Let’s review and 
practice another open path.
1. 
Delete your bell curve. Place 
the Pen tool (now with the little 
“x” next to it at X: 0.5, Y: 2. Click 
and drag up and to the right 
until X: 2 and Y: 0.5 (Visual 14– 1). 
Release the mouse button.
2. 
Now place your Pen tool cursor at X: 4 and Y: 2, click and drag a new line segment 
down and to the right until X: 5 and Y: 3 (Visual 14–12). Release the mouse button.
3. 
Finally, place your tool cursor at X: 7, Y: 1.5. Click and drag up to 
X: 8, Y: 0.5 and release the mouse button (Visual 14–13).

4. 
Your path looks like a wave of the ocean, similar to the wave in Visual 14–14. 
This line is an open path because the last anchor point is not connected to 
the point of origin. Select a fill color. Again, the open path is filled along an 
imaginary line that connects the starting and ending anchor points. The effect 
is not exactly what you might have expected. Change the fill back to [None].
5. 
Switch to the Direct Selection tool, while still using the Pen tool, by holding down 
Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) and click anywhere on the top curve. You 
have selected the first of the two line segments in your “wave” and you can see the 
direction handles indicating the direction each segment is going (Visual 14–15).
6. 
Click on the direction handle extending up from the middle anchor 
point and move it back and forth. Your wave changes pitch. Notice that 
both direction handles move simultaneously (Visual 14–16).

|  Chapter 14  |
7. 
Select the Convert Direction Point tool by pressing Shift+C. Again, when 
you move the end of the top direction handle, it changes the shape of the 
wave, but only the selected direction handle moves (Visual 14–17). You 
have just changed a smooth anchor point into a corner anchor point.
8. 
Go back to the Direct Selection tool by pressing A. Click on the middle anchor point 
to select it. This time, instead of moving the direction handles, move the point itself 
to the left (Visual 14–18). The curve of your wave changes dramatically as you move 
the middle anchor point between the start and end anchor points. Move the center 
anchor point of your wave to the left, right, up and down. If you want to make your 
wave longer or shorter, select one of the end anchor points and move it in or out.
If an anchor point is hollow, it is not selected; an anchor point that is filled in is 
selected. In Visual 14–19, you will see one more small box to the left of the path. 
This point is not an anchor point, and you do not draw it. This box indicates the 
center of your path’s bounding box. It functions just like the center point of a frame 
or circle: You can click and drag it with a selection tool to move the entire path.

Adding and Deleting Anchor Points
You will sometimes finish a path you thought was perfect, only to discover that you 
need an extra anchor point here or there, or maybe there are too many points in 
one area. No problem! Adding and deleting points in InDesign is just a click away.
1. 
Get your wave back to its original shape or (if it’s beyond repair) delete it and 
make a new one, repeating Steps 1 through 3 in the previous exercise.
2. 
Let’s say your wave is not wavy enough. Press the equals sign (=) to activate the Add 
Anchor Point tool. The Add Anchor Point tool has a small plus sign (+) by the Pen tool 
cursor (Visual 14–20). Click in two or three places on each segment of your wave. 
(Notice that direction handles extend from each new point, and the new points all 
remain selected.) Deselect all and press A to switch to the Direct Selection tool.
3. 
Click on the line and you will see all the anchor points are hollow (deselected). 
Drag each of the new anchor points up or down to make a series of smaller, 
irregular waves, similar to Visual 14–21. Practice adjusting the length and angles 
of the direction handles until you are comfortable with the process.
Sometimes you will want to delete one or more points from a path. Press 
the hyphen key (-) to activate the Delete Anchor Point tool. As you 
click on the anchor points you want to delete, they will disappear.

Smooth Points and Corner Points
Smooth points are made by dragging after you place an anchor point. 
Smooth points have direction handles. Corner points are made by one 
click of your mouse. Corner points do not have direction handles.
1. 
Delete everything in your document and press P for the Pen tool. Make a circle by 
dragging four successive curve points: one at the top, the right side, the bottom, 
and the left side. Click on the starting anchor point to close the circle (Visuals 14–22 
to 14–26). This last point is a little tricky. You will need to drag the Pen tool to the left 
to create a reasonable looking curve. Don’t worry if your circle is a little lopsided.

When using the Pen tool, use as few anchor 
points as possible. The fewer the points, the 
smoother your path will be. Too many anchor 
points will make what should be a graciously 
curved line look jagged and choppy. Practice 
making circles with only four anchor points.
2. 
Hold down the Option or Alt key to switch to 
the Convert Direction Point tool and click on 
one of your smooth anchor points. It becomes 
a corner point (Visual 14–27). Click the 
Convert Direction Point tool on the other three 
points. Your circle has become a rectangle.
3. 
 With the Option or Alt key still held down, 
drag with the Convert Direction Point tool 
on one of the corner points of your newly 
created rectangle. The corner point will 
change into a curved point with direction 
handles (Visual 14–28). Be careful! Dragging 
in the same direction as the original point will 
restore the curve of the circle, but dragging 
the opposite way will twist your curved line 
segment into a pretzel. Don’t worry, though. 
If your line segment is twisting in the wrong 
direction, just do a 180-degree turn and 
drag the handle in the opposite direction.
The Scissors Tool
The Scissors tool does just what you might expect—it will cut 
a line segment into two parts. Do you still have the circle from 
the last exercise? Use it for the following exercise.
1. 
 Press C to get the Scissors tool (or select it from 
the Toolbox). The cursor will look like a set of 
cross hairs and when it moves over your path, the 
point in the middle of the cross hairs becomes 
a small circle (Visual 14–29). With the cross hairs 
directly over the path, click the mouse. A new 
point appears on the line segment. Although 
it looks like one point, there are actually two 
new points—one on top of the other.

2. 
Press A for the Direct 
Selection tool and drag 
the new point away from 
the center of the circle. 
You have just cut one of 
the line segments, and 
the closed path is now an 
open path (Visual 14–30).
Joining Paths
Sometimes you will have two paths and need to combine them into one. Here’s how 
to do it.
1. 
With the Pen tool, begin a new path at X: 0.5 and Y: 2. Hold down Shift and drag the 
direction handle horizontally to the right until X: 2. Next, place your cursor at X: 3.5 
and Y: 0.5, click and Shift+drag horizontally until X: 5.5. After you release the mouse 
button, press the Option or Alt key to switch to the Convert Direction Point tool. Click 
and drag the end of the direction handle that extends to the right of the last anchor 
point. Release the mouse button at X: 3 and Y: 0.875. Release the Option or Alt key 
and click the Pen tool at X: 4 and Y: 2, hold down Shift and drag horizontally until X: 
6. When you release the mouse button, your path should look like Visual 14–31.
2. 
Let’s say this is the perfect shape for a cresting wave you need for a 
project, but you need two of them exactly the same. Duplicate it using the 
Option+drag or Alt+drag method (switch to the Selection tool, first) and 
place the new wave to the right of the original, as shown in Visual 14–32.

Your closed path is 
now an open path.

3. 
To join these two waves into one, switch to the Pen tool and select the last anchor point 
of the first path. The little “x” by the Pen tool cursor will turn into a slash when you get 
near the point. (It’s often a good idea to zoom in closely when editing anchor points.)
4. 
Place the Pen tool cursor over the first point of the second wave and a small 
square with two little line segments will appear next to the Pen tool cursor 
(Visual 14–33). Click and your two paths will be joined into one. However, 
you now have an unwanted line segment connecting the two points.
5. 
Undo to get two separate paths again. Before you connect them a second time, use 
the Direct Selection tool to select the last anchor point of the first wave. This will make 
the point’s two direction handles visible. Switch to the Convert Direction Point tool 
and retract the right direction handle, by dragging the handle all the way back to 
the left, until it nearly touches the anchor point. Now join the two paths into one.
Compound Paths
You will love compound paths when 
it comes to making logos, transparent 
areas inside of shapes, and creative 
picture and text frames. Begin the 
next exercise with a new document.
1. Draw two circles, one larger than the other, 
using the Ellipse tool. Select all and use 
the Align buttons on the Control panel to 
center them horizontally and vertically. 
Fill them both with Black. Your document 
should look similar to Visual 14–35.
VISUAL |14–33 |
The Pen tool is about to join 
two separate paths into one.
VISUAL |14–34 |

paths with the direction handle 
retracted on the first path.
VISUAL |14–35 |
Both circles are selected.

2. 
Press Command+8 (Mac) or 
Control+8 (Windows), or choose 
Object>Paths>Make Compound 
Path. Now you have a donut!
3. 
Make a larger circle with a fill and send 
it to the back. Move your donut around 
and you will see that your donut has 
a real donut hole! (Visual 14–36.)
4. 
If you change your mind and don’t want the compound path, select 
your donut and choose Object>Paths>Release Compound Path.
5. 
Delete everything and start over. This time draw two rectangles, one above the other 
with the smaller one on top. Put them close together, but do not have them touch or 
overlap. Select them both and choose Object>Paths>Make Compound Path. Although 
it may appear that nothing has occurred, notice that a bounding box now surrounds 
both rectangles. This means that the two are now part of one path (Visual 14–37).

6. 
Press Command+D (Mac) or Control+D 
(Windows) and place an image large 
enough to fill both rectangles. Drag 
the image around inside the rectangles 
using the Direct Selection tool.
7. 
Next you will change the shape of your 
small rectangle to a trapezoid. Deselect 
everything, and click on a bottom 
corner point of the top rectangle with 
the Direct Selection tool. Hold down 
Shift and drag it out, so that it’s above 
the corresponding upper corner of the 
large rectangle. Do the same for the 
other bottom corner (Visual 14–38).
8. 
Delete the picture from the compound 
path and click in the path with 
the Type tool. Fill with placeholder 
text. Your compound path now 
works like linked text frames.
In this short introduction, you have made compound paths using basic 
shape tools: the Rectangle tool and the Ellipse tool. Practice making 
compound paths, with shapes you create, using the Pen tool. Great job!
Summary
Having completed the exercises in this chapter, you can see why there’s no 
way any other page layout program can compete with InDesign. By combining 
advanced page layout and drawing capabilities, InDesign gives you the best of 
both worlds. Once you master the versatile Pen tool, your creative energy knows 
no bounds. Use compound paths to make your readers sit up and take notice of 
your message and images. And when you are done with this book, there’s much, 
MUCH more to explore!
VISUAL |14–38 |
Use the Direct Selection tool 
and Shift+drag out each corner 
point to create a trapezoid.
