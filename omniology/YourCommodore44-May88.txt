Yeti is the ﬁrst release from Destiny
Software and to  celebrate the fact
Destiny boss Francis L e e  h a s
announced a competition in which the
winner may or may not win M A O !
The reason for the uncertainty is
that th e  whole proceeds o f  the

of a E200 wager which Lee has placed
with hookmakers, William H i l l .
Success is linked with the destiny of
Chris Bonnington's expedition to
collect positive proof o f the Yeti's
existence.
Bonnington i s famous fo r  his
mountaineering exploits and this latest
venture follows in the wake of reported
close encounters by a recent Russian
expedition. Bonnington is totally
convinced that the outcome o f his
search will result in the ﬁrst ﬁlm of
this elusive creature, "I am convinced
the Yeti does exist and is not some
kind of large primate but a completely
new species,"

Remember to include your name and

beauty, mystery and romance together

Micro-musician Rob Hubbard has set
his sights on the Sunshine State of
California. A f t e r  working w i th
Electronic Arts a t its San Mateo

negotiations to tempt him onto its

During an incredibly successful
four years as a freelance programmer,
Hubbard has produced music tracks
for over 60 games including Sanxion,
Monty on the Run, Crazy Comets and
Knucklebusters. Despite offers from
several British software houses, he has
jealously guarded his freelance status
and Electronic Arts' offer must be
considerable though no ﬁgure has been
revealed.

Disk Dive
Evesham Micros has announced a EN
reduction in the cost of its Excellerator
Plus disk drive package. Now costing
E129.95, the package includes the fully
compatible drive plus GEOS (Graphic
Environment i l l )  will also add the
Freeze Machine cartridge to  the
package.
The popularity of the Excellerator
coupled with the weakness of the US
dollar has resulted in this special offer
which further enhances the drive as an
alternative to Commodore's own 1541.
Before the cut, the recommended retail
price of the Commodore drive was still
£30 higher than Excellerator even
ignoring the GEOS software.
We are still awaiting the results of
Evesham Micros challenge to  ﬁnd
software that is incompatible with their
latest Excellerator. Will anyone win an
Amiga?

Micronet, part o f British Telecom's
Prestel network, has launched its own
on-line music magazine, Music City.
Computer users will be able to log onto
the system and download music
software into their own machines as
well as receiving pages of music news
and views.
Micronet's operators, Telemap
Ltd, have covered the thorny problem
of copyright in an agreement with the
Mechanical Copyright Protection
Society (MCPS) whereby royalty
payments will be paid for copyrighted
material appearing on Music city.
Apart from an extensive range of
music, the magazine will also cover the
latest developments i n  computer
music.
Phil Godsell, Micronet's Software
manager, says of this system, "What
we are doing is exploiting the medium
(Viewdata) to its best advantage. Other
magazines can feature computer music
but how many o f them can feature
computer music (software) that can be
played there and then?" Obviously, he

Following o u r  review o f  Y o r k
Electronic Research's R S - 2 3 2
Interface, several customers have
requested the addition o f  Prestell

esigner is a graphics package
that offers features normallv
found on expensive commer-
cial packages. As with those packages.
this program has facilities for:
cutting and pasting;
saving and loading;
geometry:
rotating;
enlarging plus much more.
Before we go into depth about the
program itself it is important that we
understand how graphics on the C64
work, speciﬁcally i n  hi-res mode.
Hopefully you will have read about
high-res plotting in your manual and
you w ill k now a ll about it .  I t  is
important that you should also know
about multi and mono colour modes
as Designer allows you to use both of
these,
Basically you must treat the screen
as 1000 individual characters, Each
character c a n  h a v e  i t s  o w n
background and foreground colour, or
if you are using multi-colour, each
character can have three colours. A
moveable window is used within this
program t o  carry out many o f  the
functions. The window is extremely
important and will be discussed later.
Getting Started
Once the program is started it will be in
mono-colour mode. A joystick in port
2 will allow you to move the cursor
around the screen. The ﬁre button on
the joystick must be pressed and the
joystick moved up in order to start
drawing. T o stop drawing you must
press the ﬁre button and move the
joystick down.
Modes
There are ﬁve plotting modes available
in Designer. These modes not only
affect the way in which the joystick
plots, but every function that involves
any type of drawing. Keys I to 5 are
used to select the mode. The mode will

Test
If you are drawing in in tilt
mode, mode I will give you the colour
of the screen. If you have plotted any
lines in other modes, mode 1 will erase
them when you go over them again.
The same is true in mono-colour for
mode 2, as well as mode 1. You will see
what I mean if you press '3' and draw
a line. N ow  change t o mode I  b y
pressing *I' and go over the line again.
You will not be surprised to know that
modes are the most important aspect
of Designer and you will use them
frequently.

Four main menus exist in Designer
and these give access to 15 sub-menus.
On each menu the wor d 'MO RE'
appears at the bottom. Choosing thi,
moves you onto the next menu. When
you wish to return to the normal screen
you s h o u l d  m o v e  t h e  m e n u

options ar e highlighted and press

Another impor tant feature o h
Designer is the window. If you select
•window' On ITICnti 3 you will see the
current window whenever you press a
kev. Use the cursor keys to alter the
size of  the window and the function
keys to move the window around. The
window can be any size fr om one
character to the size of the screen.
The idea behind the window is that
an colours you want can be implanted
in screen, within the dimensions of the
window. Some packages tak e the
burden out o f  this by  a process of
ANDing and °R in g  and ROLLing.i_
perform this as you will see later. o l

For now we will work our way tit rough
the menus. Figure I gives details of the
menus and the options on them.
I will take each menu in turn and
look at the functions available:
TRANSFORM (A)
MIRROR: Will mirror any pixel data
or draWirig in the window.
SPIN: Will spin any pixel data in the
window by 90 degrees. The spun image
will be transferred to the top left hand
part of the screen, under the menu.
This is only really effective in mono
colour but in some cases can be used in
multi-colour as well.
FLIP: Flips over any pixel data in the
window. If you arc using more than 3
colours in the window, their positions
may become confused and you will
htRe to re-deﬁne them.
EXPAND X: Expands any pixel data in
the window. horizontally. The window
must start at the top left part of the
screen. W in d o w  s iz e determines
function,
EXPAND Y: As above but vertically.
GEOMETRY (11)
SHAPES: Yo u  w ill be required t o
input six numbers for the program to
draw the shape. The cursor will be
central to whatever shape you describe
- so if the cursor is in the centre of the
screen, so will your shape. The ﬁrst
two inputs "col and row' are for the size
of the shape. When you are asked for
the shape you must enter how many
sides you want it to have 0-2 will give a
circle. whereas 3 gives a triangle. The
fourth input is the angle of the shape.

The ﬁfth input is  for  use with the
REPEAT function_ The number t o
enter f o r  this  should generally be
between 5 and 30 for the best effects.
When you are asked for a number for
FILL, you would normally enter 2 or
3, o r  i n  s ome cases when us ing
M U L T I ,  e n t e r  t h e  n u m b e r
corresponding to the colour the shape
was drawn in. This number will be
used later with the FILL function.
REPEAT: T h e  number  speciﬁed
previously for increment is used here
to re-draw the shape at a new angle.
The new angle is found by adding the
increment to the angle of the drawing.
SQUARE: By  selecting this you will
either turn it on or off. When it is on
you will be putting down markers to
produce a square exactly the size you
require. Y o u  can also create more
complex shapes b y  arranging t he
markers in different ways. Before you
can really  get t o  grips w it h  this
function you will have to learn about
markers.
.1 here is  a  function within the
program that will allow you to place
markers at the cursor position. This is
useful f or  remembering where lines
end or start. However, there are two
further uses for markers. One is the
SQUARE and the other FUNCTION.
To obtain a square. you must place
the markers from left to right/down.
The f o u r  markers w ill b e  placed
automatically and the square will be
drawn. The ﬁrst ﬁgure shows this.
Should you wish to set up more
complex shapes you should retrieve
two markers and place a marker at a
different position. Look at picture 2.
This process can be repeated in
different ways to set up more complex
ﬁgures. You can place these markers at

the top as well as the bottom. You
should experiment with markers to see
the effects for yourself. When you are
ready y ou should tur n the square
function off and clear the markers.
COLOURS (C)
SETCOLOURS: Y o u  are asked t o
input three numbers for colours, they
are as l i r :  
A
L
When y o u  have done this  the
program will remember the colours, it
is up to vou to implant them in the
screen.
It is worth mentioning at this point
that when you clear the screen, the
three colours that have been selected
will be implanted in it.
GET COLOURS: F r om the point
where t h e  window originates t h e
screen colours w ill be fetched and
remembered. Useful i f  you leave a
drawing and forget what colours were
used,
SET WINDOW: This will implant the
selected colours within the window
only.
RANDOM: Will set the whole screen
to random colours.
CUT AND PASTE (D)
ANDS: You will be required to input a
number for the sprite that you wish to
and with the present screen data. The
operation will occur at the window
origin.
O n  A s  abov e except t h a t  t h e
operation will be OR.
XORS: As above but the operation will
he an exclusive OR,
PUT: As above but the sprite will be
placed on the screen in the normal
way.
CREATE: The program incorporates
for saving and loading pictures from
tape or disk. In order to be able to do
this you must assign your picture a
number -  then it will be known as a
sprite. To create a sprite you must have
your drawing inside the window and
must start at the top left part of the
screen for your picture to be 'photo-
graphed' by DESIGNER properly_ The
actual window size must be the same
or larger than your drawing. You can
assign a number to a sprite the size of a
character or the entire screen. Should
you reassign a  sprite, its  previous
image will be lost.
101110001

You w ill normally want t o  set
individual sprites for animation which
is also catered for  in this program.
Because this  process uses up large
amounts of memory do not expect to
be able to have much more than a
whole screens worth of drawing stored
at any one time.

CURSOR: Changes the cursor colour.
MARKER: Changes  t h e  mar k er
colour.
PAPER E: Changes the paper colour
only when using MULTI. In MONO-
colour the colour o f  the screen is
determined by the background colour
chosen.
BORDER: Changes the colour.
CLEARING (F)
CLR SCREEN

this function clears only  pixel data
selected by the window.
CLR MARKER: When selected, any
markers on the screen will be cleared.
The can of course be used again.
EXTRAS (G)
STARS: Plots random stars on the
screen in different modes
GRID: One problem in using a joystick
to draw is that it is not always very
accurate. This feature allows you to
control your drawings to the single
pixel.
When y ou select this function a
grid will be drawn in place of the menu.
The gr id corresponds t o  a  single
character block. While you are using
this function you will have access to
move the window, change modes and
draw with the joystick.
To see how this function works you
should use the function keys to move
the window well clear o f  the grid.
When you are clear of the grid, move
the cursor onto the grid and carefully
position onto any square you wish.
If you want to ﬁll any square you
should press F, but it is important that
you should keep within the conﬁnes of
the grid. Also, you shouldn't change
modes as this could end in disaster. If
you attempt to ﬁll any shape at any
time and there is a gap in between the
lines o r  line the ﬁlling w ill leak,
probably all over the screen. I  will
explain more about this later.
When you have deﬁned the grid the
way that you require press (P) to place
it on the screen at the window position.
The window should be the size of one
character to avoid any mistakes.
Should you wish to edit the data in
the grid you should press(E) and guide

don't want, then press (F ) to ﬁll them.
They will then disappear. When you

then press (P) to put it on the screen
again. Clear the grid by pressing (C).
Should you wish to examine any
pixel data. simply position the window
over the character block, and press (G)
for Get. This function should mainly
be used in MONO colour. It can be
used in MULTI colour but you should
only use mode 2, When you select the
grid function the appropriate mode
will be selected to avoid any errors.
It is  worth pointing out that i f
modes a r e  us ed inc orrec tly  t h e
function for ﬁlling will usually spill.
You w ill not be able t o edit in
MULTI c olour , b u t  t h is  c an b e
achieved b y  returning t o  MO NO .
After editing in MONO you can return
to MU LT I. One other point worth
mentioning about MU LT I colour is
that you should treat two pixels as one
pixel. Thus, when ﬁlling in a square
you should also colour the adjoining
square.
CHANGE CRSR: If you are not happy
with the cursor you can deﬁne it for
yourself. To do this you must have the
new cursor drawing at the top left side
of t he screen. I t  mus t b e  three
character blocks wide and three deep -
the normal dimensions for a hardware
sprite.
It is generally best to deﬁne the new
cursor i n  multi-colour mode. T he
markers will also take on the new
appearance. A n  important feature
about the menu box, is that any pixel
datas you place under it will remain
there when the box goes.
SCROLLING (H)
PIXELS: When this is selected, you
should enter the direction of the scroll.
The actual scrolling will be taking
place in the window only.
COLOURS: The same as above except
only the colours are scrolled.
ANIMATION: Y o u  should store a
sequence of sprites s a y  from I to 10,
to be used by this option. How many
you use is up to you. Enter the number
of the ﬁrst sprite and then the number
of the last sprite. When y ou have
entered the time delay, the sequence
will be animated.
MENU 3
PLOT/SPLIT (I)
SPLIT: This is a function that when
turned o n ,  w ill produce a  second

plotting line parallel to the ﬁrst. The
space between these lines is known as
the SPLIT, and it can be set between 0
and 9.
Try drawing some boxes and use a
marker to close the lines properly, and
you w i l l  see that the effect is  a
professional looking window.
INC SPLIT: This will alter the space
between the lines.
INC PLOT: T o achieve dotted lines,
you would ideally have the split turned
off. I f  you use INC PLOT now, you
will be able to set a space of between I
and 9 for plotting, and so get a dashed
line.
PATTERN (J)
PATTERN: When this  func tion is
turned on you will be able to draw
more fringes in any part of the screen.
In order to do this you will also have to
alter INC PLOT, but remember it will
not be necessary to do any plotting in
the normal way. You will see later that
this func tion s hould b e  us ed i n
conjunction with other options.
NEW ORIGIN: When drawing moire
fringes with the PATTERN function
you can control its origin on the screen
by selecting this command.
PUT MARKER: I have already spoken
about markers and this is the function
that allows you to place them. There
are only four  markers available for
use. Should y ou have four markers
placed and you try to place another
marker, the ﬁrst marker down will be
lost.
GET MARKER: When selected, the
last marker y ou put down w ill be
retrieved. You can retrieve all 4 should
you require.
SPRAY (K)
SPRAY: This  w ill produce a  spray
effect by  setting random pixels in a
small radius. T he thickness o f  the
spray c an b e  altered b u t  a s  t he

cursor will become slower. There are
other functions that can be used in

the thickness of the spray.

This is  particularly useful f o r  the

If you have set some interesting

the top left section of the screen.
OLD CRSR: If you have redeﬁned the
cursor to your own design this routine
will return you to the original cursor.
SLOW: So far, if  you have done any
plotting with the joystick, you have
only used one speed. This function
slows the cursor down until you either
look at the window or access it. The
only drawback with this function is
that it will slow the entire DESIGNER
program down. Press the left arrow
key to view the window and normal
cursor and program speed w ill be
restored.

The text characters will be put on

 ne of the problems with the
CM i s  t h a t  i t  h a s  n o
commands f o r  c ontrolling
the sprites which are such essential
elements for all kinds of programming
applications.
Sprites are also known as MOBs
which stands f o r  moveable object
blocks. They  are lik e tiny  screens
which c a n  b e  m o v e d  ac r os s ,
independently of the main screen and
each other. Sprites are square but they
seem to assume all manner of shapes
on the screen by rendering peripheral
areas as transparent. Anything behind
a s prite i s  visible i n  these areas
allowing the sprite to blend in with the
background.
Each sprite deﬁnition occupies a 64
byte block of memory within the I6Kb
area which the video chip. VIC, can
access. This gives a potential of 255
deﬁnitions but only eight sprites can be
displayed o n  the screen at a  time.
Exceed this value and some sprites will

disappear or start to ﬂicker.
Located ju s t  after  t h e  screen
memory ar e eight locations called
sprite pointers which indicate the 64
byte block which holds a sprite and
allocates a  program number to the
sprite.
The sprite deﬁnitions are known as
Sprite Data 0 to Sprite Data 255 but
the program calls the eight selected
sprites Sprite 0 to Sprite 8. This may
sound confusing but all will become
clear.
A problem for the beginner is that
sprites make heavy use of two of the
least understood commands in  the
Basic language — PEEK and POKE.
I remember approaching these
commands w i t h  gr eat trepidation
during my  VI C  20 days but let me
assure you that they aren't as fearsome
as you may at ﬁrst think. Imagine a
computer as a  r ow o f  glass boxes
numbered from 0 to 65535. Each box
contains a volatile number which has a
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988

1
value of' 255 or less. PEEK allows you
to look through one of these boxes to
see what number lies there. I t  then
reports back what is has found but
doesn't leave the contents of the box
untouched.
POKE actually opens the box, the
number vanishes into the ether and is
replaced with a value that POKE has
been given to store away. This value
may be derived from the original value
inside the box so PEEK and POKE are
dispatched together to complete the
mission. For example, POKE 53248,
PEEK (53248)-1-1 w o u ld  result i n
PEEK reading the value through the
side of the glass box numbered 53248.
This value would then have one added
to it and be passed to POKE. The box
would be opened and the contained
number would disappear before the
new number was inserted.
These commands form the basis of
sprite control but with eight sprites to
worry about we'll just consider one for
now

The ﬁrst task is  to organise the
memory of the C64 to accommodate
the sprites.
Setting Up
The mos t arduous tasks i n  sprite
manipulation a r e  t h e  s etting u p
procedures. First you have to decide
where the sprites are going t o  be
stored, then you have to design them in
multicolour or standard format. After
this the sprite pointers and parameters
have to be set and only then can you
really do anything with them.
Sprites have to be in the same bank
of memory as the screen and any user-
deﬁned character sets which may be
required. This has to be crammed into
a mere 1 6 K b  c hunk . T h e  mos t
constructed bank of memory is the one
which is called the default setting and
therefore is used when the computer is
ﬁrst set up. In this area virtually all of
the ﬁrst k iloby te (1024 bytes) is
memory dedicated t o  keeping the
Basic operating system operating.
Then the next kilobyte is used by the
screen. After that comes a free 14Kb of
memory which must be shared by the
program, character set and sprite
deﬁnitions.
Not much room so let's change the
memory around a little. The start of
Basic is stored in locations 43 and 44
which are set at 01 and 08 respectively.
If this can be moved to the start of
Bank 1 of memory (16384) a whole 14
Kb will be available for sprites, screens
and characters. T he Basic Mov er
listing will achieve this for you. When
creating your program substitute a
nonsense ﬁlename as string AS. Once
you have a program to load substitute
its name in AS and make another copy
of this amended program as  y our
loader routine,
Available sprites are now 13,14 and
15 in the cassette butler with sprites 32
to 255 available in normal Basic area
which is  now effectively protected
from the new Basic start.
Sprite Preparation
The program called Sprite will set up a
sprite for you to play with as Sprite
Data 13.
The computer needs t o  k now
where this sprite is so we turn to the
sprite pointers which occupy eight
bytes f r o m  loc ation 2040. W e ' l l
allocate our sprite deﬁnition to the
G E T T I N G  TO  G R IP S  W I T H  G R A P H I C S
pointer for Sprite 1 by poking the value
13 to the second pointer (POKE 2041,
13). •
Next a colour has to be applied to
the sprite. Each sprite has a register in
the VIC chip for its own colour. These
lie from 53287 to 53294. Our sprite is
dark blue so the next command is
POKE 53288, 6 .  S t ill t h e  s prite
remains invisible. The on/off switch is
located in the byte at 53269. To turn
the sprite o n we have t o  ﬂick the
second bit on by giving it a value. The
easiest way to do this is to poke the
location with 2 but the best way is to
modify the value which is  in there
already. This is  best because you'll
reach a situation one day where you
can't be sure which sprites are on or
off, all you know for sure is that Sprite
1 should be turned on. We need a
command which will set bit I but leave
the other bits  unaffected. Boolean
algebra supplies us with a way to do
this.
The O R command dictates that
when two bytes are ORed together
each corresponding bit in the two bytes
are compared with one another, i f
either o r  both are set t o  one the
resultant bit value is a 1. What happens
if 164 is ORed with 2?
164 10100100
2 00000010
166 10100110
Bit I  is set by this method and the
other bits maintain their states. What's
more if  the two bit was already set it
would also remain set. This means that
a suitable equation for switching on a
sprite would be:
POKE 53269, P E E K  (53269) O R
(2 s n )
Where sn is a sprite number from 0
to 7 .  F o r  o u r  sprite, I  w i l l  b e
substituted f o r  s n. T h is  ty pe o f
equation i s  used a  l o t  i n  sprite
manipulations so we'll call it the switch
command. T he unswitch command
which can turn any one sprite off looks
like this:
POKE 53269, PEEK (53269) A N D
(255-2 s n )
After turning the sprite on it may
still be invisible. This is because its
parked somewhere o f f  the visible
screen. PO KE locations 53250 and
53251 with 100 and it should appear,
Adding Colour
What we have done is to move the
Sprite to a position which has X and Y
co-ordinates of 100 Witten 100,100 in
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
15
X,Y format). Location 53250 controls
the X  value, Y being the preserve of
53251. A ll o f  the sprites have X / Y
registers in similar consecutive pairs
between 53248 and 53263.
The sprite looks a little strange
because it was deﬁned as a multicolour
character t o  switch fr om standard
mode, there is another location which
acts like a multiway switch. Use the
switch command substituting 53276
for both mentions of 53269.
The sprite looks better but it was
intended that the colours would be
light blue, dark blue and black. We
have already seen how dark blue can be
assigned but what about the other
colours?
In multicolour sprite mode all
the sprites on the screen have the same
secondary colours because they are
obtained fr om a  common pair  o f
memory locations, Multicolour 0 from
53285 (allocated to 01 bit pairs in the
sprite) and Multicolour I from 53286
(allocated to 11 bit pairs). 53285 is to
be assigned as black so it should be
poked with a zero. 53286 is light blue
and needs t o  contain a value of 14.
Note that the main colour, the light
blue stored in the sprite colour register,
is given to all bit pairs conﬁgured as
binary I t )  whic h differs f r om the
equivalent situation i n  Multic olour
UDGs where t he main c olour  is
designated to a 11 bit pair. A sprite 00
pairing i s  transparent a n d  shows
anything lying beneath it.
Sprites can be magniﬁed vertically
and hor iz ontally ', T y p e  i n  t h e
following commands and see what
happens:
POKE 53277.2
POKE 53271,2
POKE 53271.0
POKE 53277,0
Within a program, the correct way
to do this would be to use the switch
and unswitch command types but for
this simple demo we'll waive this
convention.
Over and Under
In normal use sprites can pass Over, or
behind. the background and may even
move across one another. For sprites
passing one another there is a ﬁxed
priority. Sprite 0 will always pass in
front of all other sprites. Sprite 1 will
pass behind Sprite 0 but in front of all
the others, and so on down to poor old

Sprite 7 which always passes behind
another sprite. I t  follows that sprite
priority should be considered when
deciding which sprite's data each sprite
pointer indicates,
Background characters such as the
standard RO M characters or  LIDGs
can be given priority over any sprite by
a register a t  53275. I f  t h e  b i t
controlling any particular sprite is set,
the sprite will pass behind any screen
characters. T o see this in operation.
move the cursor to the sprites current
position and type a few characters.
These will be hidden by the solid part
of the sprite. Next, move the cursor to
an empty lie beginning and type POKE
53275.2 and the sprite will 'sink' into
the background behind t he ty ped
characters. Many  3 D  effects can be
created using sprite to sprite and sprite
to background priorities,
When two sprites collide the event
is registered at location 53.278. Each
sprite has  it s  o w n  b i t  a n d  bot h
colliding sprites are registered. This
means that a collision between Sprite 0
and Sprite 1 w ill return a PEEKed
value of three (bits 0 and I ).
Similarly, s pr ite t o  character
collisions ar e registered i n  53279.
PEEKing normally has no effect on a
memory location but in  both these
registers the act of PEEKing causes the
register to be cleared. If a collision has
occurred s ome time ago and t h e
Sprites 0  and 1  ar e n o  longer in
contact, the ﬁrst reading of register
53278 s'ill return a value of three but a
second PEEK w ill result in  a  zero
(unless t w o  other  sprites a r e  i n
A collision is only registered when
an area of the sprite which has a bit
pairing o f  11 o r  1 0  i s  touched.
Transparent 00 pairs and Multicolour
0 areas both have no effect. This makes
it possible to have an area of the sprite
which is coloured but does not register
a collision.

Getting About
Sprites can be moved a pixel at a time
much more easily than UDGs because
of their dedicated X / Y  registers. For
Sprite 1 these registers are 53250 and
53251. Sprite movement is achieved by
increasing o r  decreasing the values
contained in these registers. Changing
only o n e  o f  t he registers causes
movement in the plane that it controls.
up o r  down. I f  both registers are
changed the perceived movement is
diagonal.
When the value of the Y register
G E T T I N G  TO  G R IP S  W I T H  G R A P H I C S
reaches a value less than 50 or greater
than 250, the sprite starts to disappear
behind the border, row by row. The
same thing happens if  the X register
falls below 24. This means that sprites
can gently glide off the screen and hick
behind the border. At power up, all ol
the sprites are stored out of sight at 0,0.
In this position they are all touching
and if they were turned on. the collision
detector would register a maximum
255. I t  must always be remembered
that sprite collisions can occur of thi,
screen as well as on.
When discussing the visible limits
of the X register no mention was made
of the maximum value. This is because.
although there are 255 pixel positions.
the horizontal resolution allows 512
pixel positions, One byte can only
store a maximum value of 255 so a
special register is allocated to store an
extra ninth bit. Only one bit is needed
to extend the maximum nine bit byte
value of 511, The ninth bits for all of
the sprites are stored in 53264, Each
high bit is allocated to a bit in this
location so setting the high bit uses the
switch command format.
The procedure starts when the
current X  value is known to be. or
PFEKed and found to be 255. This
register must immediately be poked
back to zero and the high bit in 53268
must be set. The X register can then be
increased again until it reaches 89 or
more when it starts to glide behind the
screen and under the border. Once the
sprite has completely disappeared the
high byte could be cleared using the
unswitch command format.
The best w ay  t o  master sprite
control is to jump in and try it. To help

the land of Maranna. Armed with your sword and an iron
will you must travel through the countries of your continent
until you ﬁnally face the wizard in his deadliest guise as the
soul-sucking dragon. Through joystick controls you will cut
and hack your way through winged men, chimeras, gigas
(lizardmen). bats, ﬁsh, snakes. many armed bugs and
skeletons as you ﬁght your way through the games six levels.
Along the way you can aid your quest by collecting weapons
and magical items such as a shield and armour to reduce
damage done to you, a ring to speed up your actions and
jewel for bonus points.
Rastan is a fast, smack anything that moves game which
is let down by poor animation but still worth a look by fans
of the arcade machine,
PEGASUS BRIDG E is the latest in PSS's wargamers
series and is based on the crucial airborne assault by the
British Oth Airborne Division on key gun positions and
bridges that cleared the way for the D Day landings.
This is not a task for  the faint hearted as although
desperately outnumbered, t he Britis h mus t parachute
behind enemy lines and destroy major targets before taking
and holding three important bridges against massive
German counter attacks. I f  you prefer. Pegasus Bridge
allows you to play the Germans in the equally difﬁcult job of
defending a wide area against an attack that could literally
come from any direction or take on an opponent in a head to
head battle.
CRL once again grabbed the headlines by persuading the 41
censors to slap an 18 certiﬁcate on it's new "shock, horror"
adventure based on the life and works o f  JACK T H E
RIPPER,
In the game that is built on ghoulish graphics and blood
curdling text you play an innocent man who stumbles on one
of the Ripper's victims, gels mistaken for the murderer by
the police and in your panic to escape you slay several
policemen and old ladies yourself which absurdly takes your
kill total to Ripper standards in three screens of text. You
then spend the rest o f  the game tracking down the real
(other) murderer while keeping one step ahead of the police
and out of jail.
Jack the Ripper falls sadly short of the standards set by
CRL's other horror adventures Dracula and Frankenstein
and is ruined by gory descriptions that go beyond the story
line and become just silly. For example. even if you're in a
blind panic, pushing an old lady doesn't cause her brains to
spill Out onto the pavement! Let's have less hype and more
gameplay.
Finally, on a  lighter note Cascade has released a
breakout construction kit called TRAZ. This actually stands
for Transformable Arcade Zone and includes a 64 screen
breakout game and a construction kit to build your own
screen and pack it full of bricks, traps, refractors, bumpers
and i n t e r  generators.

Mastertronic games this  month, and is  an incredibly
addictive mix  o f  collecting the correct number o f  six
different coloured crosses from Spindizzy style screens w hile
avoiding the aliens. These aliens come in several types which
will suddenly disrupt your game just when you think you've
conquered a screen. There are some that will match your
moves square for square, others that patrol certain areas,
bombs that home in on you and particularly vicious ones
that turn squares into holes.
Boing! The blockbusting ball bounces back as Firebird
launch I. BAL L  2 (The Quest for the Past). The highly
developed and intelligent ball race want to delve into their
to discover their ancestry, However, to do this you will
to brave the radioactive dangers of the ancient mines
and the perils that lurk in them and collect as many ancient
artifacts as possible. Armed with a laser and the ability to
bounce out (and in) of danger you must complete each mine
by collecting a key, then reaching the exit before the tune
limit runs out.
Each mine is constructed from a series of blocks and
barriers which have different properties. Some you can
bounce safely on. others dissolve in time and some destroy
you on contact. You will also rind magic bombs that wipe
out the critters that populate the mine, life particles (four
make up an extra life) and gemstones that produce at random
effect that can help or  hinder y ou in  y our  incredibly
addictive quest.
Finally, SABOTAGE and Z YBEX are the ﬁrst two
lines from Zeppelin Games, a new North Eastern budget
ft ware house. SABOTAGE is an incredibly difﬁcult shoot

landscape of an alien planet to ﬁnd the eight pieces of a blue
print to destroy it and end the occupation of Earth. This isn't
going to be easy and it will take some of your six lives to get
past the ﬁrst wave.
ZYBEX can be played by  either one or  two players
simultaneously that are powered by jetpacks and must battle
with a bizarre selection of aliens using whatever weapons
they can ﬁnd. Full price action at a budget price.
SUNBURST is the latest release from I lewson's Rack-it
budget label and is written by Nebulus a u t h o r
The universe is in great danger once again, only this time it's
because there are too many suns! You have been volunteered
to restore t he balance, bY attacking these suns and
destroying them by attacking energy carrying aliens that
populate giant rock formations to build up enough energy to
dive into the sun and turn it into a blackhole, which takes
you neatly, but impossibly, onto the next level.

named speed as  one o f  the main
advantages o f  pr ogr amming i n
machine code. However good you are
at programming in Basic, there are
certain routines whic h execute i n
praxis so painfully slowly in Basic that
you have to program it  in machine
code o r  not do it at all!
In this article I'd like to continue
with o u r  s imple wordprocessing
program by adding a routine which
proves this point once more. I'd like to
add a  wordwrap r outine t o  o u r
wordprocessor.
"Wordwrap" i s  o n e  o f  these
computer terms which hasn't been
known before t he advent o f  the
wordprocessor. because you can't do it
on a mechanical typewriter, nor on an
electric one. The phrase means that
you can enter text as if you had a never
ending line to write on. When you
come to the end of the actual line on
the screen, you just keep on writing,
never mind the end of the line, and the
computer does the rest.
If you have started a new word at
the end of  the old line it  moves -
"wrappes" t h e  beginning o f  that
M A C H I N E  C O D E  P R O G R A M M I N G
In this instalment of our series on programming in
machine code we add a wordwrap to our typewriter
program
By Burghard-Henry Lehmann
word onto the beginning of the next
line and moves t he current pr int
position automatic ally  f or w ar d,
accordingly, And it does all this while
you are writing, without interrupting
the ﬂow of your typing!
'Elie advantage of this is obvious.
You don't have to wonder at the end of
every line if the next word you want to
type will still ﬁt onto the old line or if
you should start a new line. (As you
know. mechancial typewriters try to
assist you in making this decision by
sounding a bell ﬁve or ten characters
before the end of the line ...)
With computers you don't have to
worry about this kind of thing at all.
As I've said, the computer takes care
automatically of the changeover from
one line to the next which allows you to
concentrate completely on what you
are writing. It is indeed as if you had an
endlessly long line to write on.
So much about the beauty of this
facility. But, as you should know by
now, the computer does nothing which
it hasn't been programmed to do. And
in order to program such a facility.
ﬁrst o f  all we have to become very
precise about what exactly we want the
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
21
computer to do and when we want it to
be done!
The Mechanics of Worclirap
First the "when". From what I have
explained s o  f a r ,  wor dwr ap h a s
obviously to be done at the beginning
of each new screen line. When the user
types in the ﬁrst character of a new line
the computer has to decide if there is
any wordwrap to be done and then do
it.
If the user enters a space at this
point, this obviously means that he has
just ﬁnished a  wor d whic h, as  i t
happens, ﬁts exactly at the end of the
old line. A n d  this  means, that n o
wordwrap has to be done. The letters
at the end of the former line are left as
they are.
Furthermore, t h e  s pac e ju s t
entered can be ignored! Because all it
signiﬁes is. that a new word is to be
started. and this new word can go ﬂash
to the left hand side, because it will be
separated from the former word by the
new line.
If, on the other hand, the user
enters a  letter, there are s till t w o

possibilities th e  computer has t o
decide on. This letter can be part of a
word which has been started on the old
line or it can again be the ﬁrst letter of a
new word, namely, if the last character
on the old line had been a space.
In the ﬁrst case, wordwrap is to be
done, while in the latter again no
action has to be taken.
Determining the Start of a New
Line
The ﬁrst routine you'll ﬁnd in this
month's listings page is to be inserted
into the main routine, as given in the
January issue of Your Conunodore.It's
best to place it directly after line 720,
which branches to CRSR right, if that
key has been pressed.
All the routine does, is look at the
current print position as contained in
SCREENMEM and see if it is pointing
at the beginning of a screen line.
At this point I have to admit that
this way of doing it is not the most
efﬁcient one in that it is rather time
consuming. Normally we don't like to
send the computer through a loop in
the middle of a major ﬂow, except if
absolutely necessary. But since we are
programming in machine code which
is so quick that you won't notice the
difference and Since! am giving you all
this only as an example to study, it
works all right for our purposes.
If y o u  a r e  i n te re ste d  i n
wordprocessing and would like to
make more o u t  o f  o u r humble
program, you might like to look for
was to do it more elegantly. One way
would b e  b y  introducing extra
variables which count the rows and
lines a n d  w o u l d  m a k e  t h e
determination o f the beginning of a
new line much more straightforward in
that i t doesn't require the program
ﬂow to go through the whole loop
every time a key has been pressed.
(This could be, at the same time, the
basis for a routine which displays the
line and column the cursor is on, either
at the top or at the bottom o f the
screen ..,)
But in the context of this series of
articles the routine numbered lines 780
- 1130 does us just as well.
It starts by saving the last keypress,
which is contained in the accumulator,
in a variable, called "TEM PSTOR
Pushing this byte onto the machine
stack would not be a very good idea,
since we will need to recover it in the
wordwrap routine itself and, i f you
have studied t h e  l a s t a rti cl e
M A C H I N E  C O D E  P R O G R A M M I N G
thoroughly, you will know by now that
you can't pull something from the
stack in the midst o f a subroutine
which you have pushed onto the stack
before you called that subroutine!
(Remember my advice from the last
article; if you aren't certain, better save
important data i n  a  variable than
pushing it onto the stack and be sorry!)
The ro u ti n e  i ts e l f i s  v e r y
straightforward. The beginning of the
second screen line (we are, of course,
not interested in the beginning of the
ﬁrst line!) is loaded into a variable,
called "LINESTART". Then it goes
into a loop which compares the start of
every line on screen with the contents
of SCREENMEM.
If a match is found, it means that
the current position is at the beginning
of a  new line. I n  this case o u r
wordwrap routine is called i n  line
1050. A fte r  returning fro m th i s
subroutine it continues as normal (line
1060).
If no match is found, the loop exits
after 2 4  goes, TEMPSTORE i s
recovered into the accumulator and
everything continues as normal.
Dealing with a Space
The wordwrap subroutine itself, which
I have assembled at ORG 50100, starts
off by loading the result o f the last
keypress back into the accumulator
(line 100) and- testing it for a space
(lines 110 - 120).
As I have explained earlier, if the
user has pressed the spacebar at this
point, it means that he has just ﬁnished
a word and now wants to start a new
word. Therefore, no wordwrap has to
he done and this space can be ignored.
In lines 140 - 150 the routine waits
for the next keypress. When this
keypress has been done, the result is
stored in TEMPSTORE (line 170) to
match i t with the ﬂow of the main
routine, and then it exits prematurely
from t h e  wordwrap subroutine,
continuing as normal.
If, on the other hand, a letter key
has been pressed, w e  enter th e
wordwrap routine proper.
First we save the current position
in the textﬁle. the current screen
position and the current position on
the colour screen i n  three new
variables, ca l l e d  TE X TS A V E ,
SCRNSAVE and COLRSAVE (lines
260 -  390). (Remember, for those of
you who still have the old ROM, we
always have to deal with the position
on the colour screen too!)
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988

Doing the Wordw rap
The wordwrap routine itself consists of
two parts. First we have to ﬁnd the
beginning of the word which the user
has just started and then we have to
move that part onto the new line.
Furthermore, we want to substitute -
"pad" - the beginning of the word on
the old line with spaces so as to erase it.
The ﬁrst part consists of a loop
(lines 440 -  660) which works
backwards, looking at each former
character until it ﬁnds a space. This
space signiﬁes that the beginning of the
word, the user has just started to type,
has been found.
The X-register is used as a counter.
Afterwards it will tell us. how many
letters have to be moved onto the new
line.
Notice also, that we are going back
with the variables we have initiated at
the beginning of the routine so as not
to change the contents of our main
variables, TEXTFIL E, SCREEN-
MEM and SCREENCOL! The reason
for this will become clear in a minute.
Lines 610 - 630 test for the space.
Once the space has been found we have
to go one step forward again, because
we are not interested in that space
itself, but rather in the ﬁrst letter of the
word, which follows it. This is done in
lines 700 - 800 where each position is
incremented by one.
Moving the Wordstart
After this we are left with two positions
in the textﬁle, on the screen and on the
colour scre e n . T E X T S  AVE,
SCRNSAVE a n d  C OL R S A V E
respectively point at the ﬁrst letter of
the word which has just been started,
wrhile o u r  standard variables
TEXTF1LE, SCREENMEM a n d
SCREENCOL point at the current
position at the beginning of the new
line.
All we have to  do now is use
Indirect-Y to move the data from one
position to  the other, while, at the
same time, erasing the old position
with a space.
This is done in the second loop,
which I called "MOVELOOP" (lines
850 - 1020).
The Y-register is used to move the
data itself from the old position to the
new one and is therefore incremented
with every pass through MOVE-
LOOP,
The X-register, which holds the
amount of letters to be moved, serves
again as our counter and is now

"TYA" is a very simple one byte
instruction which stands for "Transfer
the contents of the Y-register into the
Accumulator". Since this instruction
doesn't change the contents of the Y-

" T AY"  transfers the content's o f
the accumulator into the Y-register
and thus does the opposite of what we
are doing in our routine.
" T AX"  transfers the contents of
the accumulator into the X-register.
" T XA"  does this same thing the other
way round.
Finally, the lesser used " T X S "
transfers the contents of the X-register
into the stack-pointer, while "T SX"
does the same thing vice versa.

Dan Dare II

eagerly awaited follow-up looks set t o  repeat that
success with avengence — Mekon's Revenge.
The Mekon has been plotting the downfall of Earth
after Dan foiled his last scam which employed a deadly
asteroid. Scientists have been working night and day to
produce a genetically engineered race of Super Treens whose
awesome powers are sure to give the Mekon total victory,
Even now they are on their way...
Dan. at the head of a Space Fleet hit squad. has managed
to penetrate the spaceship's defences. His mission is to seek
out and destroy the Super Treens dreaming of war as they
hibernate in their protective Plexiglass Life Support Bubbles
(my mates at Virgin believe in safe sacks),
The ship is  separated into four  brilliantly coloured
sections lull of ordinary but deadly Treens and Space Fleet
troops. The lasers blast in all directions so Dan has to duck
and shoot his way through the throng. trying not to shoot his
own ITICI1 in the process.
Secreted around the complex are control panels which
operate force-ﬁeld barriers. Any intrepid adventurer would
be well advised to shoot these out ﬁrst because the minute a
Super Treen Bubble is blasted a self-destruct mechanism
clicks into action. I f  Dan can't destroy all of  the Super
TreCtIN and get to an airlock before the countdown reaches
tero, the whole section of the ship will be de-rezzed and take
him on a one way trip to oblivion.
The time limit for  completing the spring treening is
extremely tight and only a few small errors are allowed. Ms,'
best advice is to spend some time memorising and mapping
the corridors, but be careful not to run out of energy. When
you then blast your ﬁrst Super Treen you should at least
know where you ought to be going.
If Dan makes it to the connecting passage to the next
level, a door closes behind him and he is protected from the
explosion.
The ﬁrst level is relatively easy to complete but from level
two onwards the going gets tough. Convoluted corridors,
artiﬁcial gravity generators which push you away from your
goal, refuse crushers that turn you into space cabbages, ail
conspire to keep you from your goal. One way tubes suck
you in and blow you out miles from your intended location.
Life Support Bubbles appear in the strangest of places and
their control panels resemble the force-ﬁeld generators so
closely that you can start the countdown before you realise
what you've done.
As you reach the higher levels. Treens and Space Fleet
troops disappear into hidden passages. Keep your eyes open
For this because these short cuts can mean the difference
between life and death.
Assuming that you reach and complete the fourth level,
G A ME S  R E V I E W S
there's a nasty surprise waiting when you meet the Mekon in
an eyeball to ﬁshbowl confrontation which really gets Dan
Dare's dander up. Armageddon out of here!
When y our proﬁciency level has reached mammoth
proportions and you can whizz through the spaceship like a
dose of assaults, it's not time to chuck the cassette in the bin
because another challenge awaits — you can become the
Mekon and try to beat Dan at his own game.
The Mekon's task is to release all of the Super Treens but
desperate Dan has triggered off the destruct sequence. If you
ﬁnd the time (Unit tight as Dan, you'll never make it as the
Mekon. To succeed you'll have to zip around the corridors at
breakneck speed — no wonder the Mekon's green.
The programmers are credited as Virgin's Gang of Five.
Judging by their results, Dan Dare II has been a labour of
love and the graphics are some of the best planned that I've
seen for a long time and the logic challenges even surpass its
precursor.
The version that I received was a pre-release without
music but the sound effects are sufﬁcient to keep me happy.
Anything over and above this would simply be a bonus but I
would liked to have seen a Hall of Fame scoreboard.
Mekon's Revenge scores very highly on all counts and I
hope that the Gang of Five get to work on a sequel very soon.
Dan Dare — software of the future!

ice guys end up with Madagascar! That's the warning
issued to would be Lords of Conquest that take up
the challenge to dominate the world in this Electronic
Arts strategy game. This isn't an attack on Madagascar. but
a reﬂection on its poor strategic location and how despicable
Lords of Conquest players need to be to stand any chance of
winning.
Lords of Conquest can be played by up to four players or
on your own against a tough computer opponent and Fought
at three different skill levels, three different levels of luck and
over 20 different predeﬁned maps or one created by the
computer or by you using the map creator!
The game is  developed fr om a  board game called
Borderlands and s o features easy to play board game
gameplay combined w it h  t h e  ﬂexibility and number
crunching of a computer. Each game begins by dividing up
the areas of the game map between the players with the game
level, deciding who has ﬁrst pick and in a one player game if
either you or the computer has two or four bonus areas.
The game is then played in turns with each player
allowed to launch two attacks into adjacent areas. The
success of an attack depends on the opposing forces and
support available from neighbouring areas. These forces
consists of weapons (infantry ) and horses (cavalry) in the
basic game which can be transported about by boats in the
intermediate a n d  advanced, allowing attacks almos t
anywhere in the world.
The object of the game is total domination by anhilating
your opponents before they get you. In a one-player game
this is a simple head to head battle, but in a multi-player
game you just can't win on your own so you have to make
and break alliances to suit your needs.
A basic game can be won or lost by the player who has
control of the gold mines and horses rearing grounds. These
produce the wealth and horses necessary to raise armies and
create cavalry and with them launch attacks. You can also
use your gold reserves to build cities that not only add to the
defence of the area it's in and the adjacent areas but also
doubles gold production in those zones,
In more advanced games the gold and rearing grounds
are joined bv coal mines, iron ore mines and timber yards
that all produce much needed resources at the end of' each
turn. In these more complex games the player must juggle
these resources to build weapons and boats to carry his
weapons and horses to foreign lands. For example, a weapon
can still be bought for gold but also made with iron and coal.
Similarly a city can be built if you have a combination of
timber, iron, coal and a little gold.
Changing the luck level alters the certainty of combat. At
its lowest level, combat is a simple matter of the highest total
winning with the aggressor winning any ties. If you increase
the luck you increase the doubt, since ties are decided
randomly and at the highest level the chances of success are

determined by the percentage of attackers and defenders.
Lords of' Conquest is a superb strategy wargame that will
bring the worst out of you. Either when you're tackling one
of the nine levels o f  computer opponent o r  breaking
agreements with human allies, you'll discover depths of
treachery and deceit you never knew you had. The game
displays these acts in dramatic style particularly during
combat as other players that have states bordering on the
action have to declare whether they will support the attacker
or the defender. Then the ﬁreworks really start as anything
from "I pressed the button at the wrong time" to" we agreed
I could take that state" being used as excuses. Whatever the
arguments only one thing is certain and that is that there can
only be one winner.

compiler writing in the hope that it will
inspire you to greater things. Writing a
compiled language system is not as
difﬁcult as you may think. Perhaps the
most difﬁcult par t is  deﬁning the
language itself: the commands and
their syntax. The language used here is
called First Compiled Language or
FCL: not a very original name I admit
but it will do for now. FCL is a very
simple language w h ic h  prov ides
facilities for handling unsigned integer
values a n d  als o character strings.
Some basic program control structures
are provided and facilities exist for
calling machine language subroutines.
Certain features have been borrowed
from other languages. Those of you
familiar with Ny c o/ may recognise
certain F C L  featur es  s u c h  a s

for reference only and do not require
explicit deﬁnition within a program_
What is a Compiler?
In simple terms, a  compiler is  a
program w hic h takes a  program
written i n  a  s ome language a n d
produces a  f a s t  mac hine c o d e
equivalent. The term "compiler" is
often applied t o  another ty pe o f
program, the assembler. The major
difference is that "c ompiler
often applied to a high-level language
translator while "assembler
a p r o g r a m  w h i c h  tr ans lates  a
particular microprocessor assembly
language. In some eases (such as the
FCL system) an assembler may form
part o f  t h e  c ompilation process,
translating the output from the code
generator stage. I t  is normal for the
complete process t o  be s plit in t o
stages. This allows certain parts to be
updated as required and often eases
the task of compiler construction since
each part may be tested separately'.
Many
languages a r c  c oin piled; examples
PASCAL. On the other hand. BASIC is
usually a n  i n  I erpr e t ed language
(although BASIC compilers do exist).
The differences are discussed later, but
to confuse the issue, there is a sort of
halfway house. The FORTH language
system uses what is often referred to as
an in t e r a c t iv e  c o m p ile r  a s  i t
incorporates the best features of both
Systems.
Compiler Vs Interpreter
In an interpreted language system such
as Commodor e 6 4  BASI C ,  t h e
program text is  prepared using an
editor which is normally part of the
interpreter itself. This usually takes the
form of a line editor in which a line of
text is  entered, preﬁxed by  a  line
number which determines its position
in the program. When the code is
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
28
executed, t h e  inter pr eter  begins
processing the text at the ﬁrst line.
Each line is  scanned f o r  language
elements whic h w ill determine the
operations t o  h e carried out. T he
syntax of the line has to be checked as
it is executed. The actual operations
are carried out by subroutines which
are part of the interpreter code_ Once a
line has been processed, the interpreter
forgets all about it and goes on to the
next line. Because the program has to
be scanned in this way. the actual run
speed tends to be slow. Compare this
with the action of a compiler.
Once again, the program text is
edited using some form of screen or
line editor. Here the similarity ends.
The compiler scans and translates the
whole program before execution. I n
some cases, a form of pseudo-code is
produced which is then executed by a
fast i n  in 
I
n
 others, an
actual mac hine c ode program i s
produced. T h e  execution speed is
considerably faster than an interpreted
system because there is no need to
continually check the syntax of each
program line. Runtime support is
provided by a library of routines which
are either appended to the end of the
ﬁnal program or loaded into another
part of memory at runtime.
When you turn on your C64, you
can begin programming immediately
in BASIC thanks t o  the interpreter
which is  held i n  permanent R O M
memory. You can edit programs with
the built-in editor, load and sitY•e your
programs and RUN them. All of these
features a n d  m o r e  a r e  prov ided
courtesy of the BASIC interpreter. In
addition to these, the interpreter will
allow you to perform most commands
outside o f  the program: i.e. in direct
'node. The interpreter is interacting
with you. Interpreters are generally'
interactive systems. This is useful when
you have to debug a program. You can
halt the execution o f  the program.

required and then cause the program
to continue. Although execution speed
may be slow, program development
and debugging is relatively quick and
easy.
When using a compiled language
system, s imilar editor facilities arc
provided by an editor program which
must be loaded into memory_ Unlike
an interpreted system. no interactive
testing of the program may be carried
out. Debugging the program is a much
more complex affair due to the lack of
these interactive facilities. Certain
systems do provide debugging features
but these usually take the form of a
separate program, used alongside the
executable program at runtime.
On the basis of this comparison, it
appears that the interpreted system
scores better on program development
than the compiler whereas the reverse
is true for ﬁnal execution speed. From
this, it would seem that some kind of
interactive compiler would be ideal.
FORTH goes some way to providing
this seemingly ideal programming
environment. FORTH is a language
developed some years ago f or  the
control o f  r adio telescopes. T h e
compiler prov ides  m a n y  o f  t h e
interactive features o f  an interpreter
and once y o u  g e t  us ed t o  t h e
peculiarities of the language itself, it
becomes a n  ex c ellent s oftw ar e
development system.
The FCL Compiler System
The FCL compiler has been written in
BASIC. Before you cringe, consider
what I ' v e  s a id  a b o u t  pr ogr am
development and debugging. The only
other option I  had was  machine
language and it is considerably easier
to develop the techniques in a high-
level language. The BASIC on the 64
is. as we have seen, an interpreted
language and the penalty is a painfully
slow execution speed. You could use
FCL to develop a new compiler so long
as you don't mind having your lunch
while it compiles...
The Bug File
This system isn't perfect Fin afraid.
There are one or two problems with
this version, whic h oc c ur mainly
within the library routines whic h
provide the runtime support. Most are
merely a n  inconvenience b u t  t h e
fourth point may cause a real problem.
Here is the current list although I
P R O G R A M M I N G
expect that there are some that I have
not come across_
•  The autoincrement a n d  autode-
crement operators do not work. It was
intended that the ++ and -- operators
would provide autoinc. and autodec.
within expressions a s  i n  t h e  C
language. What actually transpired
was that they would only work when
applied to a single numeric variable.
•  The D E R  R() function does not
behave altogether sanely i n  some
situations. I've found that a couple of
dummy DERR(I's is a good idea. I've
not been able to ﬁnd why this happens.
•  On some occasions, reading a n
INPUT ﬁle which does not actually
exist may cause the machine to hang
up. A  R U N / S T O P - R E S T O R E
keypress will reset the machine.
•  After an extended execution o f  a
program using string manipulation
and/or type conversion operators and
functions, the memory ﬁlls up with
redundant strings. Due t o a design
ﬂaw ( by  yours truly ) n o  garbage
collection facilities exist nor can they
be written for this version. The effect
of this is for the program to stop with a
memory f u l l  e r r o r  a f t e r  s o me
considerable time. This may be OK for
most applications since the memory
given over to the storage of strings is
considerable; the memory left free
after the program is loaded which is
normally in excess of  about twenty-
odd K.
The FCL Language
Before setting o u t  t o  wr ite y our
compiler, y o u  s hould deﬁne t h e
language. If you are writing a compiler
for an established language then you
need only follow the standard for it.
Designing y our  own language is  a
challenge for both your programming
skills and your imagination. When I
originally started out on this project.
my intention was to write some kind of
super-assembler which would make
machine code programming easier for
beginners_ As the project developed. I
decided t o  be more ambitious and
write a high-level language compiler.
This brought its own special problem;
that of language design.
The ﬁrst thing I had to do was to
deﬁne a programming language. A t
one point I  thought about writing a
compiler for BASIC 2, but decided to
walk before running! And so the FCL
project was born. The ﬁrst thing was to
deﬁne thr ee groups o f  language
elements; statements, operators and
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988

fu net ions. Thes e a  re deﬁned a s
follows:
Statements are actual program-
ming commands N,yhich cause some
immediate effec t s uc h a s  screen
clearing ( CLS)  o r  decision control
(I F/ELSE/EN DI E).
Operators Arithmetic. logical and
relational operations causing effect on
one or more variable quantities. For
example; add ( +) , multiply  (
logical exclusive-or (XOR ).
Functions Language elements
which return a result when given one
or more parameters. The LEN. ASCII
and SYSFN functions are examples.
These appear in an expression.
The next task was to decide what
kind of  data this language should be
able to handle. Since this was my ﬁrst
attempt at such a project. I decided to
keep things simple and allow only
Unsigned integer and character string
types. Facilities for  type conversion
were considered necessary and s o
functions such as ASCII and CHAR
were included.
The next section is  basically a
programmers' reference manual f or
the language. It details items such as
variable declaration and explains each
staement, operator and function_ I f
you g o  o n  t o  develop y our  ow n
language, it may be a good idea to
write everything down in  a  similar
form to this before you start to design
and program your compiler.
FCL Programmers Reference
In the following document, ludic
characters are used to highlight FCL
language elements. The source editor.
EDIT selects lowercase mode when
executed. Please note that the FCL
compiler w ill not accept uppercase
characters except where they occur
within string literals.
A F C L  program consists o f  a
variable dec lar ation s ec tion, a
program ins truc tion section a n d
optionally one or more subprogram
instruction sections. T h e  v ariable
declaration part is  called the Data
Division and the instruction section is
called the Procedure Division. These
names are for reference only and are
not required in the program unlike the
COBOL language from which these
terms a r e  borrowed. Subprogram
sections are subprocedures which have
the same basic construction as the
main procedure but are identiﬁed as
subroutines b y  t h e  s ubr outine
statement.

All variables and subroutines must
be declared before they are referenced.
This means that subroutines should be
placed in the program before the main
Procedure Division or be pre-declared
using t h e  .
subroutine has been pre-declared with
forward then i t  mus t b e  deﬁned
elsewhere, t y p i c a l l y  a f t e r  t h e
Procedure Division.
A procedure section always starts
with a begin statement and ends with
the end statement. This is true for both
the Procedure Div is ion a n d  a n y
subroutines. The compiler will print a
warning i f  i t  ﬁn d s  a  v ar iable
declaration within a procedure but the
variable will still be deﬁned. An error
condition occurs if the compiler ﬁnds a
program ins t r uc t ion out s ide a
procedure; ix, in the Data Division. In
this case, the instruction is ignored.
Should a n y  e r r o r  oc c ur  dur ing
compilation, t h e  creation o f  t h e
symbol and literal data ﬁles will be
suppressed thus effectively preventing
code gener at ion.  S h o u l d  o n l y
warnings be ﬂagged then the creation
of these ﬁles will proceed as normal.
The Data Division — declaring
v a
All variables to be used in the program
must be declared here. You may also
pre-declare any subroutines which are
not explicitly deﬁned until after the
Procedure Div is ion. Variables ar e
declared using the var statement along
with descriptors int, string, and arrav.
A variable o f  the type " int "  is an
insigned integer whose value may
range from 0  to 65535 inclusive. A
variable of type string is a sequence of
characters of  length up to 255. The
array descriptor creates an array o f
either in: or string types.
Variable and subroutine names
must b e g in  w i t h  a n  alphabetic
character a n d  m a y  c ontain a n y
alphanumeric characters thereafter.
The maximum length of a variable or
subroutine name is 20 characters. FCL
reserved words may not be used as
variable names. The name "a" is also
illegal. So m e  examples o f  v alid
variable declarations are given below:
Var int counter,. maxcount
var string inputline
var int table array (10)
var string edit array (200)
While declarations o f  differing
types must be made on separate lines,
array and non-array variables of the
P R O G R A M M I N G
same type may appear on the same
line. N o t e  als o t h a t  y o u  c annot
dynamically deﬁne arrays ix . var int
xyz array (abc) where "abc " is  an
integer. You may use integer variables
as subscripts in a procedure section
only. So m e  examples o f  illegal
declarations are shown below:
tat' int count, string line -  dont mix
types
var string table array (cou nt ) -  no
dynamic decl.
var int bset -  bset is reserved
Pre-declaring Subroutines
Normally, a  subroutine should be
deﬁned before the Procedure Division.
The forward statement allows you to
pre-declare a  s ubroutine t o  t h e
compiler thus allowing you to place it
anywhere in the program. When you
declare a subroutine in this way you
must explicitly deﬁne it somewhere in
the program otherwise the compiler
will report an error,
The external statement may also be
applied to subroutine names. This sets
up a  d u m m y  referenc e d u r in g
compilation. It is possible to use this
feature t o  mak e special c alls  t o
machine code programs in memory at
runtime, This is not a recommended
method of making such calls. Refer to
the s y s c all statement a n d  s y s fn
function descriptions for details. Using
external in this way involves editing the
intermediate. ASM ﬁle produced by
the CO DEG EN stage, A n  example
Data Division is shown below:
Example of a comment line
; Example of a Data Division
Var in: max, mini a r r a y ( 5 0 )
var string userinput
; typical forward declaration
; forward getinput,printkeys
, explicit deﬁned subroutines go here
; start of Procedure Division
The Procedure Division — begin
and end statements
All program instruction lines must
appear within a block bounded by a
begin/end pair . T h i s  applies  t o
instructions w i t h i n  a  subroutine
deﬁnition as  well as  those in  the
Procedure D i v i s i o n .  T h e  e n d
statement generates different c ode
depending on the context in which it is
used. I n  the Procedure Division it
generates a  pr ogr am termination
sequence whilst in  a  subroutine, it
generates a return-from-subprocedu re
sequence. Should any instruction line
appear outside of  a begin/end block
then the compiler will report an error.
Numeric Expression and Literals
The compiler is capable of  handling
dec imal, b i n a r y ,  o c t a l  a n d
hexadecimal numeric literals. I n  an
expression, t h e  w ay  i n  whic h t he
compile will interpret a literal numeric
quantity is determined by  a  special
character preﬁx. The dollar ($) denotes
hexadecimal: the percent (
binary; the ,
there b e  n o  preﬁx, t h e  compiler
assumes the literal to be decimal, the
following examples w i l l  hopefully
make this clearer:
58000 As s umed to be a hexadecimal
number.
(
number,
01 741 Assumed t o  b e  a n  oc tal
number.
3212 A s s u m e d  t o  b e  a  decimal
quantity.
Note t h a t  depending o n  t h e
number base used, certain characters
may be considered illegal i.e. octal only
uses numer ic  characters 0  t o  7
inclusive, 8  and 9  being considered
illegal.
In a numeric expression you may
include operators, numeric variables,
numeric literals and numeric functions
(i.e. those returning a numeric result).
The compiler performs type checking
on an expression and will report a type
mismatch error should it detect any
type irregularities such as an attempt
to assign a string to numeric variable,
String Expressions and Literals
Only certain operations are allowed on
strings such as concatenation (joining
strings u s in g  + )  a n d  r elational
comparisons. There are a number of
string functions available. An attempt
to assign a numeric quantity directly to
a string variable w ill cause a  type
mismatch error.
A string literal should be delimited
by quotes ( ") . An y  character may
appear w it hin a  s tr ing inc luding
uppercase letters and ascii control
characters, T he total length o f  any
string quantity must not exceed .255
characters otherwise a string length
error will occur.

Subroutines
A subroutine is a sub-procedure whose
structure is similar to that of the main
Procedure Division but is  declared
outside of it. A subroutine consists of a
subroutine statement followed by  a
block of program instructions inside a
begin/end pair. The subprocedu re may
contain a n y  o f  t h e  p r o g r a m
instructions which are valid in  the
Procedure Division including calls to
other subroutines. Also provided is the
return statement whic h allows the
programmer to force a return-from-
subprocedure from a point other than
the end of the subroutine. Any attempt
to place a subroutine deﬁnition inside
any procedure will cause the compiler
to abort with a fatal error.
To call a subroutine, you can either
simply plac e t h e  n a m e  o f  t h e
subroutine on a line by itself or use the
more speciﬁc call statement. Both will
produce a call to the subroutine. An
example is shown below:
: Example of the use of subroutines

end
Operator Precedence
The order in which operations in an
expression are carried out is known as
the order of precedence. The compiler
will effectively rearrange the order of
elements in an expression according to
the following table which is in order
P R O G R A M M I N G
from the highest to lowest precedence;
I. Functions
2. Decrement/increment (-- and ++)
3. Division/Multiplication ( / and #)
4. Subtraction/Addition (- and +)
5, Relational comparitors ( <  „ >
>  =. <  >  and =)
6, Logical operators ( N O T ,AN D ,
XOR and OR)
Within t h e  g r o u p s  s h o w n ,
precedence is from highest to lowest.
i.e. in an expression A N D  would be
evaluated before OR.
Multiple Condition Testing
As in BASIC you may test for multiple
conditions i n  o n e  l i n e  us ing a
combination o r  the relational and
logical operators, A TRUE condition
evaluates as I (not -I as in BASIC) and
a F ALSE condition evaluates as O.
This i s  a l s o  t r u e  f o r  s t r i n g
comparisons; i.e. the result of a string
comparison is a numeric quantity, 0 or
1. The following are examples of valid
comparisons:
if  c ount >  5ur maxint=10*minint
(count)
result=inputstring=userstring
write 3*(inputstring=userstring)
Refer later for description of the if
and iithe statements. Note that the
system tests for a FALSE condition
rather than a TRUE one. This means
that in an expression such as ifﬂag. the
variable "ﬂag" is tested to see i f it
contains the value of FALSE (0). Any
non-zero value in "ﬂag" will evaluate
as TRUE.

Square brackets [ and are used to
denote optional parameters whilst a

parameter options.
Setting memory locations: bset and wset
1. bset < address> , < numexp >
2. rise! <address > , <numexp >
I. A  single byte in  memory at <
address > is set to the value of < num
exp >  whic h must be in the range
0.255.
2. Two consecutive bytes in memory at
< address a n d  <  address >  I  are
set to the value of <  num exp >  in
normal lo/hi-byte order.
Program control I :  loop/while/end-
loop /w hen
loop [when <  condition >1
<  instructions>
oulloop [when <  condition >  1
The loop/endloop pair allow a set of
<  instructions >  t o  be repeated
depending on one or more conditional
expressions. The while/when options
allow testing of conditions at the start
and/or end of the loop.
With loop while <  condition >
the loop will be entered only if the <
condition >  evaluates T R U E
otherwise control is passed to the ﬁrst
instruction following the corresp-
onding endloop statement.
With en/loop when < condition >,
an exit from the loop will occur only if
the <  condition >  evaluates TRUE
otherwise control is passed to  the
corresponding loop statement. Note
that if no condition i s  tested for at
either end then the loop will continue
indeﬁnitely i.e. an endless loop.
Program Control 2: iﬁelse/endif
if 
<
 condition >
<  instructions I >
[else 
<
 instructions 2 >
endif
If <  condition ev aluates  TRUE
then < instructions I > is executed. If
the optional else clause is included and
<  condition > evaluates FALSE the
<  instructions 2 >  is executed. The
endif statement must be included in
either case.

Input/Output I: charout
Charow #  channel >  ,1 <  num

This is the basic character output
call which outputs a single character
whose ascii code value is <num exp>
Normally the screen is used unless a

into 5 tab positions at intervals of 8
characters. The apostrophe () forces a
carriage return.
Examples of write statement lines.

ﬁlled with Monets and Renoirs heads for Germany and it is
at the station of Metz that you. Pierre LeFeu, a member of
the French Resistance ﬁrst catch up with it. Your objective is
to steal the train back and return it and its contents to the
people of France,
It is midnight when you and your companion Le Duc
attack the station. You must provide cover for him as he tries
to board the train. This involves shooting soldiers who
appear behind lit windows of thestation building before they
shoot you. Get hit once and it's game overtime. No ﬁve lives
here,
Lc Duc signals to you when he is ready and all you have
to do now is get the train back to western lines before dawn.
Fortunately you do have some experience to give you a
hand.
Operating the train involves coming to terms with the
various controls in the cab. Throttle and brake are fairly

responded i n  different way s , Some t r ie d t o
'ngratiate themselves with the Allies and prove that they
really were decent chaps after all and had only been obeying
orders. Others tried to prepare for a life of luxury once all
hostility had cesaser, presumably in South America.
One such German was Hermann Goering. Commander
of the Cierman Air Force, drug addict arid art collector. The
term collector is used in its loosest sense. He used the
German occupation of France to appropriate as much oft he
French national art treasures for his own personal pleasure_
As the German armies withdraw from France, so a train
simple, but you must also make sure that the furnace is well
stoked if you are to maintain a good head of steam. There is a
steam blow off facility -  needed in case the boiler is about to
blow up and you must learn the system of whistles which will
alert the resistance to switch points for you.
As you progress you can monitor your position bv
summoning up a map screen, You will have to negotiate
attacks from enemy night ﬁghters as they attempt to strafe
the train as well as gunboats when you cross a river. These
boats cannot be outrun so you need to stop on a bridge and
blow them out of the water before they can blow you up.
Stations are a different proposition. You can run them if
ou choose but stopping might be necessary in order to
refuel. Once you have taken a station - played in exactly the
same way  as  y ou attacked Metz, y ou also have the
opportunity to send a signal to the resistance. You can ask
them to take a bridge or station for you but they will only be
able to hold it for two hours so it's up to you to make good
time, especially if you want repairs in a station.

sprites can lift a dull program
into a  new dimension. The
ability. to design a series of characters is
an essential skill which, once mastered.
leads the way to professional results in
utility creation as much as in game
production. UDG s  are based o n  a
simple 8X8 pixel grid but sprites are
slightly more complicated to create on
their massive 24x2 I pixel grid.
Faced w i t h  t h e  problems  o f
standard and multicolour modes, the
prospect f o r  t h e  b e g in n e r  i s
overbearing hut the hardest part is
typing in the reams of data which make
up the characters. With eight bytes per
UDG and a possible 255 characters.
the best way to enter the data is to use a
graphic design program which allows
you to construct a graphic on a grid
and save a whole section of memory.
This block can then be loaded from
within t h e  mas ter  pr ogr am. A
co mbined o r  c ompanion s pr it e
designer is also desirable but make
sure t h a t  b o t h  programs hav e a
in o p t i o n .
ROM Raiding
UDGs are similar to the characters
that the ROM uses and if some of the
ROM characters are needed on the
sarne screen as the LIDGs they have IL)
be downloaded ﬁrst. This is  not a
simple case o f  peeking and poking
because the ROM is banked away out
of sight beneath the I / O  registers at
53248 through 57343.
When accessing t h e  character
ROM all I / O  functions are disabled,
including the keyboard so care must be
taken to get this part of the program

correct. I f  a  mistake is  made the
computer will be as dead as a dodo

saving before running.
Characters and screen must lie in

Creating UDGs
LIDGs use exactly the same size grid as
the normal R O M characters -  8X8

your own characters by  following a
Few simple rules.
A character grid is shown in ﬁgure one.
Every r ow is stored as a byte of

up a byte correspond to the eight bits •

Access to the new character set is
achieved through the low nibble of
location 53272 af t er a l l  o f  t he
necessary bank switching and screen
positioning has been completed.
Selecting where the characters lie in
the character set requires a little bit of
common sense. If characters are to be
used it is best to allocate them the same
values as the ROM uses. For example.
the letter A should be the second group
of eight bytes. This means that it can be
placed on the screen by  poking the
value of I to the screen location where
it is to be displayed, just as you would
if you were using the ROM characters.
The colour o f  the character is
stored in the normal memory map
(5529(110 56295). To assign a colour to
a character, a value must be poked to a
corresponding m e m  o Ty lo c a  t i on
within the map. Any of the 16 colours
can be chosen but a character moving
across the physical screen map in
have its  movement shadowed b y
'liming its colour around the colour
map, it doesn't happen automatically.
Colourful Characters
Standard UDGs only use two colours.
a foreground c olour (switched o n
pixels) and a  background c olour
(switched off pixels). This limits the
visual impact of the character and the
use of multicolour characters can help
here, buy at a price.
The multicolour character gr id
only has half of the resolution of  a
standard character - 4X8 pixels. This is
because the c olour information is
stored on board the character by a
clever use of paired bits.

The eight byte values f o r the
character are calculated by allocating a
value to the paired bits of each pixel
using ﬁxed regulations. Background
colour is  always designated as 00.
Multicolour I  is 01 (binary value
Multicolour 2 becomes 10 (binary 2)
and Multicolour 3 is designated by II
(binary 3). This correlation between
the paired pixel value in decimal and
the name of the multicolour type acts
as a useful reminder when creating the
characters. Substituting these values
into the grid we derive the following
values:

The values look similar to those
which were calculated for  standard
UDGs and it is difﬁcult to tell them
apart just by looking at the ﬁgures. Try
to display a multicolour character and
the differences soon become apparent.
Just as R O M characters cannot be
used as  multicolour characters, s o

Colour Slots
The colour is selected for  the three
multicolour options i n  one o f  two
ways. Multicolour I is  taken from a

determines Multicolour 2, The values
contained in these locations can be any
of the colour values from zero to IS
but, without resorting to split screen
machine code routines, they are the
same colours for  every multicolour
character on the screen.
Veil at least you don't have to
worry about mov ing t h e  colours
around the screen!
Multicolour 3  is  stored i n  the
colour inap and determines i f  the
character is displayed in multicolour
or standard mode. The C64 is a very
unforgiving machine and I've always
suspected that it s  designer was a
Yorkshirernan -  you don't get owt for
nowt and the price you pay here is a
reduced c olour  range. T h e  s ame
sixteen values may be poked to the
map but values up to seven display the
character in standard mode with the
assigned colour attribute following the
normal rules, lithe value lies between
eight a n d  ﬁfteen. the character is
displayed i n  multic olour b u t  t h e
colour of Multicolour 3 is derived from
the poked value minus eight. This
means that the C64 steps back to the
old V I C  day s  w i t h  o n l y  e ig h t
foreground colours available.
The multicolour mode is limited
but c an produce superb results i f
handled properly. Use its weaknesses
wisely and the result can be deceptively
more colourful. Across the whole
screen, the only  c olour which can
differ for each character is M ul t icolour
3, s o use this  as the main colour
whenever possible, leaving the other
two colours as shading or minor detail
hues. I f  the tw o ﬁxed colours are
selected f r om the extended c olour
range (8 to 15), the colour range will
seem wider and problems o f  colour
clashes will be less frequent.
In both modes the background
colour which shows through will be set
by a poke to location 53281 but this is
not always the case.

Extended Backgrounds
No pix el i s  actually switched o f f
because everything on the screen is
displayed as a colour. What we really.
mean by an off pixel is one which is
turned on to display the background
colour which is normally ﬁxed for the
full screen. In extended colour mode
this rule is broken, but the cost isa very
serious loss in the range of characters
which can be displayed.
Instead of the usual 256 character
set. extended mode only has 64. These
are repeated four times and a different
background colour can be assigned to
each o f  the otherwise identical sets.
The colours are assigned by locations
53281 to 53284 and depends on bits six
and seven o f  the character's screen
mode. Reﬂecting on this, you soon
realise why  only  64 characters are
available. When the value of the screen
character exceeds 61. the 64 bit is
altered. Since this bit determines the
colour, the system reverts to screen
code character zero (the 'at' symbol)
but w i t h  a  different background
colour.
The location that the colour is
taken f r o m  i s  determined b y  t he
following table:

64 to 127

I V  to 255
The character colour is determined
in the normal way using the colour
map but only standard character mode
can be used because the multicolour
locations a r e  us ed t o  select t h e
background colours.
Extended mode is controlled by bit
6 of location 53265:
POKE 53265. PEEK (53265) OR 64
To turn the mode off again the OR
64 is substituted with AN D  191.
Though this  mode is  limited in
character range, it does include all of
the alphanumeric and punctuation
characters which makes it  ideal for
creating striking title or text screens.
Sprites
The same rules apply t o  sprites as
apply to character deﬁning. A sprite is
,iust a movable block of characters with
a skeleton that looks like ﬁgure six.

Sprites consist o f  six character
blocks w i t h  t h r e e  h a l f  height

A sprite deﬁnition f o r  a single .

into consecutive bytes i n  memory

placed into the next three bytes as O.
56. O. The other 57 bytes would follow
the same pattern until the sprite was
fully deﬁned. This only ﬁlls 63 bytes.
The extra byte serves no purpose but in
cases where more than eight sprites are
used this byte could be pressed into
service as a store for the sprite colour
(in multic olour  mode t his  w ould

The problem is where to store all of
this information. The VIC chip 16Kb

as it does to screens and character sets.

Sprite colours are stored in  the
eight locations which start at 53287
and these colours relate directly to the
order of the sprite pointers.
Before a sprite can be used, it has to
be seen. Sprites are turned on through
location 53296 whose eight bits behave
like a row of light switches, turn a bit
on and the sprite lights up. To control
each bit is not simply a case of poking a
value. The following syntax will serve
any purpose:
POKE 53296, P E E K  (53296) O R
(2 • SN)
For SN simply substitute the number
of the sprite which you want to see. To
turn it off again substitute AND (255-
2 ^SN) for the DR statemen(.
Brighter Sprites
Sprites can also be displayed in their
own multicolour mode which is totally
independent o f '  t h e  c har ac t er
multicolour mode but follows roughly
similar rules.
Once more the sprites pixels are
paired horizontally giving a reduced
resolution o f  12 double-width pixels
per row. This gives the possibility of
four colour tvpes: transparent and
three colours.
G ETTING  I N T O  G R APH IC S
There are no limitations applied to
the range of colours in any of the sprite
multicolour registers but two o f  the
colours are ﬁxed for all of the sprites
On the screen at one time. This time the
ﬁxed colours are designated by bit
pairs with a!binary conﬁguration of ()I
(colour stored in location 53285) and
11 (stored in 53286). A bit pair of 10
takes its colour from the normal sprite
colour registers starting at 53287 and
can be varied for each sprite.
A byte pair of 00 is designated as

We take an in-depth look
at the 8563 chip which
controls the video display
of the C128
By D. Anderson
128 P R O G R A M M I N G
erhaps one of the most interest-
ing aspects of the Commodore
128 is  the 80-column screen.
Indeed, the 8563 chip which controls
the v ideo display, has  some very
interesting aspects within itself. A n
examination o f  the memory map.
reveals that the 8563 has only two
locations reserved for it. This would
tend to indicate a very simple chip,
without any o f  the 'frills' of  earlier
Commodore graphic chips -  after all,
two registers can hardly control any
earth-shattering effects.
However. C o mmo d o r e  hav e
employed a n  unus ual t r i c k  i n
implementing this  chip. T he usual
method o f  allowing access to a chips
registers, is to map them into memory
- this means that they can be accessed
directly with a simple PO KE to the
desired register. However, with the
8563, we have a seldom used method,
in w hic h ju s t  t w o  locations a r e
reserved in main memory. In order to
write to a register, the register number
is placed in the ﬁrst location, and the
value to be inserted into it is placed in
the second register.
For Commodore users, this may
seem a  rather long winded way o f
doing things. but i t  does have its
advantages, namely, that very little
I / 0  space is required. Anyone familiar
with the old Color Genie will recognise
this technique.
The surprises do not stop there! If
you search through the memory using
the monitor , look ing f o r  t he 80-
column screen, you will not ﬁnd it.
Where has it gone? Well, the answer. is
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
38
that it is not in the memory. Strange,
you may  think , but true! The 80-
column screen is  i n  it s  ow n self-
contained 16K or RAM, which does
not appear in the memory map. To
access this, data intist be sent through
the two 8563 I / 0  locations. Again,
long winded. but it does mean that
your text screen does not gobble up
any of the main memory.
So, when Commodore tell you that
you h a v e  j u s t  b o u g h t  a  1 2 8 K
computer. you can tell them that they
are w r ong -  you've g o t  a  148K
computer (128K main memory. I 6 K
80-column screen, and 4 K  o f  I / O
memory), How many 148K computers
do you know? Not many !
Now for the bad news ! Due to the
complicated method of accessing the
8563, i t  means  t h a t  y o u r  M i C
programs will be more complicated,
and a little slower (although i f  you
switch t o  2MHz  mode, this should
compensate for this).
The two locations in memory for
the 8563, are SD000, and SD001 -
register in  SD000. value in SD001.
Some q u it e  s tar tling effects a r e
possible by playing around with these
two registers, including moving the
screen pos ition. s mooth scrolling.
partial screen blanking, and many
others.
Now, I  expect you want to know
how to manipulate the text screen -
ﬁrst, you need to know how to use the
two locations to store this data on the
screen. B y  investigating the kernal
print routines. I have been able to ﬁnd
the locations which are necessary for

this. By the way, if you wish to explor
the Cl28 kernal, the same addresses as
used on the C M  can be used -  as a
jump table has been inserted, so that
calls to the kernal will still be to the
same place.

$ll

F - c o n t a i n s  the value to

Next, we need to know how the
video memory is set out. By sending
codes to the video memory. I  have
been able t o  p u t  together  t h is
breakdown of the memory:
$0000 -
$0800 -
$2000 -
text screen
attributes for text screen
character deﬁnition
data
Unfortunately. there are some had
side-effects to the indirect addressing
of the 8563. Firstly, since it is acting on
its own, independent o f  the main
computer, you have to make sure that
it has ﬁnished doing its last job before
you ask it to do another. This is done
by reading SD600, i f  the 8563 is not
busy, then bit-7 of this is cleared. I f
not. we just have to wait until it is not.
Secondly, when you write the address
to be manipulated in registers $12 &
8I3, this  is  tak en b y  t h e  v ideo
controller, and it appears to change it.
As a result, if you do not get your value
to be stored in the memory in time, it
ends up in the wrong place -  very
useful ! BASIC ends up being much
too slow for this, and so unfortunately,
to access the I6K of RAM, we have to
use machine code. Figure 1 shows an

If we want to read the contents of a
cell on the text screen, then instead of
writing the new value of  $D001, we
read the contents of 81)001. Figure 2
shows an assembly listing for this.

The attribute data o n  the 80-
column screen, is considerably more
complex than that o f  the VIC chip.
Besides the usual colour deﬁnitions, it
is also capable of ﬂashing. underlining
and reversing characters. Incidently,
since the 8563 allows the character to
be reversed through hardware, there is
little point in deﬁning a character set.
where hail of it is taken up by reversed
versions of the rest - if you write your
own software t o  us e t h e  reverse
attribute.
However, the most important bit in
the attribute byte, is the one which
selects from which character set the
displayed character will come from.
This enables both sets of Commodore
c harac ters  t o  b e  d i s p l a y e d
simultaneously. (When shift/CBM is
pressed, the whole screen does not
change. as it does on the VIC chip's 40-
column screen.) Since both sets are in
the characterdeﬁnition memory at one
time, this bit allows two character sets
to be displayed simultaneously -  thus
allowing a character set of 512. If you
wish to manipulate this attribute data.
it is done in exactly the same way as
placing characters o n  t h e  screen,
except that the position of the video
memory is different, (See the memory
map given earlier.
Re-deﬁning Deﬁnitions
Now, as I said earlier, the deﬁnitions of
the characters are all stored in the
RAM, so to alter these, we just read
new deﬁnitions into t liis. and hey-
presto !  N o  need t o  bother about
switching ROMs in or out, and no need
to bother about interrupts, as in the
VIC c hip. Program 1 .  presents a
program that allows you to re-deﬁne
the deﬁnitions, and to subsequently
save thetn onto disk. The machine
code data which contains check digits,
so any errors are reported, contains
the routines  already  discussed -

altering the attributes, and altering the
character deﬁnitions.
Since the video R A M  does not
appear in the normal memory map. it
is n o t  possible t o  save i t  o n  a
peripheral. Thus, it was necessary to
transfer it across into main inemor
before this  process was  complete.
Users may like to examine this code
with the aid of the monitor, Figure 3
shows a simple breakdown.

are you wouldn't want to buy it when you saw what it
was about. American Football is one of those games like
cricket that people either love or hate. There is no middle-
ground.
It would be a pity if  you did turn your nose up at it
though. as it is the best simulation that I have come across so
la r.
Produced by Accolade, who also gave us the excellent
baseball simulation Hardball, 4th and Inches is both easy to
play and easy to get hooked to.
The game is entirely joystick controlled from selecting
your play from a menu to manoeuvring key players as you
try to complete the move.
You have two players available for each position. The
coach's screen gives you an assessment of each player and
allows to substitute at will, Each player is rated according to
his speed and strength. The ratings are speed. fast, quick,
steady, solid. strong, tough and big. In general, the faster
you are, the smaller you are and vice versa.
There are eleven main types of offensive formation from
which the computer selects ﬁve for you to choose from.
These include shotgun, double tight end, short yardage and
the various kicking plays. Once you have selected your
basic formation, you must then choose the precise play you
are going to attempt. be it running, passing or kicking.
Medium passes out of a shot gun tend to work very well here.
Occasionally you are ﬁxed as the play you want to attempt
does not feature in the list offered by the computer, but this is
a minor quibble and most of the time you will have ample
choice.
While you are doing all this, the defense likewise selects
its strategies as it tries to outguess the offense. Should you
line up for a pass or a running play or do you hedge your
bets? What about blitzing the quarterback and if so, should
you use your defensive backs or linebackers'? A useful tip
here is that the computer very seldom runs with the ball.
Another nice touch is that if you are playing against the
computer, your chosen plays are highlighted, but if you are
playing against a friend, the plays aren't lit up so that both
players can choose in secret.
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988

Once all the plays have been chosen, it is time to put
strategies into action. Into the offense, you control the
quarterback once the ball is snapped and it is then up to you
when you release the ball. Too early and your receivers will
not have completed their patterns. Too late and you risk
being sacked.
Once the ball has been passed or handed off, you take
charge of the receiver and can then attempt to move down
ﬁeld as far as possible before getting jumped on by the
opposition. Here again, it is necessary to know who you have
just given the hall to. It is pointless trying to break tackles
with your lightest fastest wide receiver — a side step should
prove to be more effective.
The defensive player can select the man that he wishes to
control although this may change as the ball moves down the
ﬁelds. Only a small area of the ﬁeld is shown at any given
moment so if  the ball moves any great distance, the play
'zooms' into the next section of the ﬁeld.
Kicking. be it punting, or  attempting a ﬁeld goal or
point-after requires you to time the kick properly. Misjudge
and you will top the ball horribly.
Don't forget to watch the clock either. You have three
time-outs each half, and it is essential to know when the
clock will stop automatically, or you have to do it yourself.
The animation of the characters is excellent and unusual
in American Football games. All twenty-two players are
shown. The choices presented to you together with the
tactics chosen by the computer ensures a wide open fast
ﬂowing game. The result is both extremely playable and
highly addictive. Even i f  you don't understand all the
formation names and what the players are attempting to do
(a few more diagrams in the instructions would have helped
here) you will soon get a feel for the action and it won't be
long before you are calling the plays like an old pro. Very
highly recommended,

Bit-mapping i s  rarely used b y

makes programming difﬁcult.
A single hi-res screen occupies 8Kb
of memory for the pixel requirements
and a further 1000 bytes for the colour
information. Fortunately. it is possible
to access the RAM which lies under the
ROMs at 40960 to 49151 and 57344 to
65535. Using the latter area is best
because Basic memory can be left
intact.

is set the colour map can be positioned
at one of eight locations in the lower
part o f  the bank  o r  i n  the eight
positions at the top of the bank when
Bit 3 is zero. See Tables I and 2 for the
possible locations and byte values.
In our case, the bank covers the
locations from 49152 to the top o f
memory but an area to be avoided is
53248 to 57343, unless You're curious
to see what a system crash looks like.
This leaves two areas, one of 4K b and
another of  8Kb. I t  stands to reason
that the pixel screen is going to be
stored in the 8K b block from 57344 to
65535. Where the colour memory goes
is purely arbitrary within the bounds
of 49152 and 53.247: any 1000 bytes will
do so we'll use those starting at 52224.
This means that sprite deﬁnitions 0 to
47 c an b e  stored i n  f r om 49152
upwards. The sprite pointers start at
53240.

The c olour  m a p  controls t w o
aspects of the screen colours. The high
nybble is used to deﬁne the foreground
and the lower four  bits deﬁne the
background. F o r  example. i f  the
screen is ﬁlled with byte values of 110.
the binary  equivalent is  01101110.
Splitting this into two nybbles gives:
0110 = 6
1110 = 14
The result is  the standard C64
screen livery of a light blue foreground
on a dark blue background.
In the listing section there is  a
machine code program, Hi-res Setter.
which sets the memory conﬁguration
and clears the colour map and pixel
screen.

Fri hi-res mode each byte in the
pixel screen corresponds to eight pixels
on the screen but the top line of the
screen does  n o t  r u n  a l o n g  i n
consecutive bytes (0, I, 2, 3. etc) but in
increments of 8 (0, 8, 16. 24, etc). The
second line follows a similar sequence
1, 9, 17, 25. etc). -
strange but remember what I said at
the beginning: the bit-map screen is
really 1000 U D G  characters. A
character is an 8X8 pixel block so the
hi-res screen byte sequence goes down
eight bytes, back to the screen top,
across one byte and then down eight
bytes again. This is shown in Diagram
This means that programming is
no simple matter. A straight line along
the top of  the screen would poke a
value of 255 into byte 0, then into byte
8 and move on by jumps of eight until
byte 312 is reached. If this is difﬁcult
just consider t h e  problems thas t
diagonal lines pose!
What is needed is a system which
allows a pixel position to be described
by X and Y co-ordinates. This means
that the pixel is found by  counting
across X pixels and down Y pixels. The
range in the horizontal. or X. direction
is 320 (0 to 319) and in the Y direction
it is 200 pixels (0 to 199). The co-
ordinates are written (X,Y) so the top,
left pixel is (0,0), its neighbour is (1.0)
and the bottom, left pixel is (319.199).
The way in which this is translated
into actual screen b it  positions is
calculated in the following way. We
ﬁrstly need to ﬁnd out which character
holds the pixel. There arc eight bytes
per character column so the column in
which the pixel lies is given by:
COLUMN = INT(X/8)
Similarly the row is calculated by:
ROW = 1NT(Y/8)
To check this well use co-ordinates
(319.9). The column is I NI(319/8) or
39 and the row calculation gives I. This
means the pixel lies somewhere in the
extreme right hand character on the
second screen row - remember that the
columns are numbered 0 to 39 and that
the rows rum from 0 to 24.
•I•o ﬁnd which o f  the character's
bytes holds the bit we want we only
have to concentrate on the low nybble
if the co-ordinate value. There are
eight bytes numbered 0 to 750 the byte
;due is given by:
BYTE = Y AND 7
To ﬁnally pinpoint the bit is not so
easy. There are eight bits so applying X
G E T T I N G  TO  G R IP S  W I T H  G R A P H I C S
AND 7 would render a value but the
numbering of the bits would have to
run from left to right for this value to
be c or r ec t. U nfor tunately , t h e
numbers run from right to left so the
bit equation becomes:
BIT = 7 - (X AND 7)
The actual byte on the pixel screen.
which starts at a numerical location
which we'll call BASE, is calculated
by:
LOC= BASE+ R O W * 1
BYTE
To turn on the pixel we use:
POKE L O C .  P E E K  ( L O C )  O R

This a ll means quite a  lo t  o f
calculations and it  takes its toll on
processor time. Hi-res Basic routines
are s lo w  a n d  multic olour  hi-res
routines are even worse, which is one
of the reasons why we won't be looking
at them here.
Studying Form
One of the problems of using this area
of memory is that although data can be
poked to the screen it cannot be read
back again without switching out the
ROM„A short machine code and Basic
routine will ﬁx this.
The Hi-res Demo listing shows
how the screen can be used. After
setting up and clearing the memory.
the program proper is entered at line
1000. The actual equation used for
drawing the line is Y=mX, where m is
calculated by (Y2-Y1 )/(X2-X 1) but if
Y2-Y I is zero the line is a horizontal
bar and i f  X2-X1 is  zero the line is
vertical.
A t r a p  routine is  included t o
prevent Y  or  X  from exceeding the
screen boundar ies  other wis e a
computer crash c ould result. T h e
formulae f o r  calculating t h e  b i t
position are then applied but. before
the ﬁnal bit is poked into place, the
Kernal ROM has to be switched out.
To do this the machine code routine
must know where to look for the byte
under the ROM.To this end, the high
and lo w  by te o f  the location are
derived f r o m  v ariable L O C  a n d
poked i n  reverse order to 250 and
251. During the SYS call the peeked
value is stored and, on returning to
Basic control, this location is peeked,
bit modiﬁed and then poked back
under the ROM.
The lines numbered in the 1000
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
45
range can be modiﬁed to draw many
different shapes. A few suggestions are
listed underneath the main program -
substitute these lines and as a ﬁnal
project y'ou could start to write your
OW dr aw ing program using sprites
and joystick control.
The only thing which can go wrong
will show up if you press RUN/STOP
and RESTORE. The reset that follows
pokes a table of Kernal jump locations
under the ROM causing the corruption
of four of the hi-res character squares.
It w ould b e  possible t o  wr ite an
interrupt driven program to store the
32 bytes from k)ction 64816 elsewhere
in memory so that they can be restored
if necessary.
Ili-res programming is a challenge
which fully  tests a  programmer. A
knowledge o f  maths is essential but
even this  is  not enough t o  create
efﬁcient routines. Algorithms  w it h
strange-sounding names (Bresenham's
line. Bezier-Bernstein approximations
to name but two) have been derived to
take advantage of the computer's pixel
matrix. Many o f  these routines have
later been applied to sprite movement
to mov e them i n  strange patterns
through calculation rather than under
direct control. What happens on the
hi-res screen can often be adapted for
use elsewhere. This mode is a great
teacher but a hard master,

scrolling effects y o u  h a ve  t o
understand two basic concepts. These
are smooth scrolling and interlink
interrupts.
If you've ever watched a scrolling
Spectrum game, you'll have noticed
the j e r k y  movements o f  t h e
background. The same is often true of
the Amstrad CPCs, so why is the CM
different? The answer lies in the fact
that the whole C M  screen can be
moved a whole character to the right
of its normal position. This is done in
eight small stages, each o f  which
corresponds to the distance between
adjacent pixels. You may have heard
this referred as a hardware scroll.
Try the following demonstration:
10 FOR  A=1  T O  7:P0KE53270,
PEEK((53270 AND 248) +A)
20 FOR B=0 TO 250:NEXTB,A

53270. PEEK((53270 AND 248)+A)
40 FOR B=0 TO 250:NEXTB,A
50 GOTO 10
A scroll based purely on this would
hardly be stunning but consider one
character in the home corner of the
screen. Assume that the screen is

scrolling to the right. After narrowing
the screen down to 38 columns, the
character scrolls eight pixels to  the
right (similar to program line 10):
D ittA fr a in
Then the screen jumps straight
back to the original position (value 0).
In the twinkling of a microsecond the
character is poked to the column to the
right of its original position. This gives
the impression that it has glided bit by
bit into its new position, just like a
sprite moving across the screen.
Diagram 2
Then the procedure repeats but
this time the character ﬁnished in the
third column position. Once th e
character reaches the end column it is
poked back across into the ﬁrst
column again.
For a  demonstration o f  this
phenomenon try the Character Scroll
listing in the back pages of this issue.
You'll notice that the whole screen
moved to the left, making this suitable
for moving the 'scenery' about only.
The whole screen is moved bitwise for
eight pixels.., no problem. Then on
each row the characters have to be
moved one position to the right and
the last character has to be moved to

the ﬁrst column. This would give a
wraparound effect.
This requires over 80 actions per
line for the microprocessor or about
2000 actions per screen. Each action
averages four or ﬁve cycles of the clock
which surpasses the interrupt period.
There i s a  maximum o f  three
interrupts which can be chained so
that i t  seems that actions occur
simultaneously. This makes it possible
to scroll the whole screen but even then
care has to be taken.
Most games require a scoreboard
of some kind, so the example I have
given allows fo r  this and makes
scrolling easier.
Splitting Images
In normal operation the scoreboard
would keep jumping back and forth in
sympathy with the changes in location
53270 ($13016), This can be prevented
by splitting the screen.
Imagine that the screen is split at
line 20. For a fraction of a second the
screen is locked in position with a zero
value in the lower three bits of location
53270. This allows a stationary image
to be scanned onto the screen. When
the ﬁrst 20 rows of characters have
been 'printed' to the screen the second

interrupt runs a routine which scrolls.
the picture according to a value rising
from zero to  seven. This value is
updated with each call to this interrupt
and transferred fro m i ts  storage
location to 53270. At the start of the
top o f the screen interrupt this is
changed back to zero for the stationery •
screen.
Diagmm3
All this happens so quickly that the
screen appears to scroll in the bottom
portion only, the top holds steady. A
trick of the eye as well as electronic
magic.
There's no reason why you can't
change colours too. Last time we saw
how interrupts could change borders
and character sets to mix them on the
same screen, this time we can break the
rule that states that all multi-coloured
characters have to have three colours
in common (including the background
colour) and one which can be varied.
Now all o f the colours can change
within the area of the screen splits!
The Status Quo
All you have to  remember is that
anything you change in one interrupt

quo must be maintained if order is to
prevail.
This is also true when returning to'
the main, non-interrupt linked,
routine. Remember this and your half
way to mastery of the screen. Also
remember that the screen is scanned
from left to right and top to bottom so
vertical splits are out nomatter which
way you scroll the screen.
Stretching these rules further, it is
possible to add another interrupt to
the screen, giving three distinct bands.
One of these is stationary, one scrolls
slowly and the third scrolls quickly.
This gives a perspective effect i f the
characters used make the stationary
screen the moon and stars, the middle
split the far perspective and the third
split the foreground. Piperun may
seem like a long listing but it contains
the necessary routines to show one of
these pseudo 3D landscapes.
Once you  have typed i n  the
program, look at the moon. This is
created b y  adding sprites t o  a
character representation of the moon.
The sprites form the bottom half of the
moon in the second split and gives a
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
47
realistic effect o f the moon passing
behind the mountain range. This
makes the reality of the existance of
split and such trickery is the key to
good programming.
Piperun i s  well annotated and
disection of the interrupt routines will
give a clue as to what is happening on
the screen.
Changing Direction
Scrolls don't have to  occur in one
direction. Splits can be used to scroll
sections o f  the screen i n  opposite
directions, a t  right angles to  one
another or even combine the vertical
and lateral movements t o  allow
multidirectional scrolling. Vertical
scrolls arc controlled by the lower
three bits of location 53265 (SD011).
so you might like to pay around with
this and see what happens.
When you add joystick control
with four optional interrupts a realistic
left and right scrolling effect can be
created. Joysticks wil be the subject of
the next article, so until then enjoy
playing with screen splits and scrolls
without interruption.

bloodshot eyes peer out from under a
shock of dishevelled hair -  the video
junkie mainlining on his stash of trash.
Over the top maybe, but there's
more to computers than meets the eye.
I remember my ﬁrst computer with
great affection. In fact, I spent so much
time with it that my girlfriend went off
with somebody else and I  hardly
noticed! Computer  addic tion c a n
damage more than y our  love life,
however. Studies are currently being
carried out in  this country and the
USA to draw up guidelines for people
who use computer frequently. T he
cynics may scoff and say that many
people s pend a s  l o n g  watc hing
broadcast programmes  o n  t h e i r
television b u t  such outbursts only
show the ignorance o f  the speaker.
OK. I admit that a lot of time can be
spent watching the box but consider
the difference o f  televiewing w it h
computer watching.
When have you seen someone only
a matter of a yard or  less from the
screen'? When does anyone watch so
intently that they can't look away for a
moment. The answer to both of these is
when they are playing a  computer
game or programming. Some people
may occasionally get so wrapped up in
a T V  show that they watch just as
intently but this is for a relatively short
period - some computer users do it for
hours. All the time you're watching,
the screen throws  a l l  manner o f
electromagnetic radiation and charged
particles a t  y o u .  W h a t  t h i s
accumulative effect may he is not yet
known. but I'm sure it can't be healthy.
Of greater concern are the physical
and mental effects that computers
certainly d o  initiate. E y e  s train,

crippling pains in the hands have all
been a t t r i b u t e d  t o  p r o lo n g e d

First Steps
What can be done to avoid these
risks? Obviously, limit the time you
spend glued to the monitor. When you
turn it on, decide how long you intend
to use it for and adhere to your time
limit. A couple of hours is quite long
enough. You can then go and have a
coffee, read a book on the detrimental
effects of caffeine, get some fresh air.
In fact, do anything but computing.
You can go back later if you must, but
remember y ou r un the risk o f  the
digital equivalent of sunburn if you sit
there too long!
Not everyone is  prone t o  t he
hazards o f  c omputing b u t  as k
yourself', "Is it worth the risk?"
How can I be so gloomy on a day in
Spring, the time of the year when a
young man's fancy lightly turns to
thoughts of programming.
Newcomers t o  the noble ar t o f
computing may be wondering what
computer art is all about. How does it
all work? Well, the computer screen is
made up of tiny dots of light, called
pixels (picture cells). B y  giv ing a
different colour to groups o f  pixels
letters, words, a  whole new world
can be created. Even movement can be
simulated. Nothing actually moves on
the screen, it only appears to -  the
haunted goldﬁsh bowl strikes again!
Movement is achieved by switching
pixels on and off in sequence, just like
the light tubes festooning the hip-hop
jock's disco box. As one light goes out
another comes on and it appears that
the ﬁrst light has jumped from A to B.
To get some idea o f  this try' the

Project
Stealth
Fighter
I
been the ﬁrst computer game to cause a stir in the US
Congress. Project Stealth Fighter is a combat ﬂight
simulator based on the F-19 'Cihostrider, the ultra-invisible
warplane of which the Pentagon denies any knowledge, but
which the whole world knows about - you can even buy a
plastic scale-model kit of it.
In many ways this is an update of Microprose's earlier
fﬁghtsim, F-15 Strike Eagle. but with the accent on stealth
and electronic warfare. The F-19, apparently known to
pilots as 'The Frisbee' is a strange-looking animal, more like
a ﬂying saucer than a conventional jet ﬁghter. The idea is to
avoid reﬂecting back enemy radar beams, which the spiky
bits on regular jet ﬁghters do. The penalty is an overall
reduction in ﬂight performance.
As a result, this package is more complementary to
Strike Eagle. rather than supplanting it. The emphasis is on
swiftly getting into enemy territory. performing your
mission, whether this is the interception o f an enemy
aircraft or a ground strike, and getting out again, while
alerting the enemy defences as little as possible.
Like th e  earlier ﬂightsim. PSF features three-
dimensional wire-frame graphics, however it applies these to
ground features, not just to hostile planes. This deﬁnitely
ups the realism quotient and the excitement, as does the
fact that you actually have to land your aircraft at a friendly
base. In F-15 Strike Eagle. you were safety home if you
simply overﬂew your home base.
PSF also offers a vastly expanded range of' weapons
options (reviewing this game one starts to sound like an arms
dealer -  we are deﬁnitely talking about an enhanced-
lethality combat scenario here). You get to toy with two
different types of AA missiles, infra-red horning Sidewinders
and radar- guided AMRAAMs, plus an extensive range of
air-to-ground missiles, just about anything non-nuclear in
fact.
Targets are either in the air or on the ground in four basic
scenarios. The ﬁrst one involves making life hell for the poor
old Libyans, the next involves singeing the mullahs' beards
over the Persian Gulf,.and the last two, the hardest, are over

and you can always turn down one of the randomly chosen
missions, if it looks had to you,
Medals and/or promotions are awarded depending on
results. This is where I found thegame a little dull, compared
with its predecessor. It awards most o f the points for
destroying the target, being undetected (ﬂying slow and
avoiding enemy radars) and getting back safely. As a result.
the incentive to indulge in lengthy dogﬁghts. which were the
bits I  enjoyed most in F-15 Strike Eagle seems much
reduced, particularly as there isn't a lot of fuel margin left
after you've subtracted everything needed to get to the target
and back, and th e  F
particularly wonderful compared with a Mig-29 Fulcrum.
Still, there's scope for a lot of adrenalin secretion here -
the run in over a ground target can be particularly hairy -
with Migs and S A
easy to ﬂy into the ground while trying to activate your infra-
red and radar jammer and ﬁre off decoys, let alone hit the
target.
A nice touch too is the keyboard overlay, which can be
conﬁgured to ﬁt either the C64 or C128. Admittedly without
it the game would be impossible. Sc) many controls have been
added. The documentation is excellent too, with a 115-page
manual and a full set of mission maps.
Microprose, possibly sensitive to  criticism o f  the
company's somewhat Reaganesque stance, has included a
disclaimer in the package. It seems that the company really
has nothing against anyone Islamic or Russian at all.
If that's so. felts, let's see _you do a Mig simulation, with
scenarios varying from Angola to Cambodia. Or how about
a Hind gunship mission over Afghanistan?
Politics apart, this is a compulsive game, and one I
played into the small hours. n o t  sure I'd swap my copy of

Amiga, a  Porsche i n  every other
respect, has a two-stroke under the
bonnet in those grinding 3.5" drives.
The new drives should be fast movers
and 1.2 Kickstart has improved access
times greatly. But you might like to
look at FACC II i f those icons still
pop up to the drumming of frustrated
ﬁngers.
FACC II comes, via the Amigas
Centre Scotland, from ASDG (easy to
type that one), an American outﬁt with
a background in Amiga utilities.
The Floppy Disk Accelerator relies
on clever software to  get as much
information into memory as possible,

thus decreasing access to  the disk
surfaces. The memory assigned i s
known as a buffer and the technique
as disk cacheing. AmigaDOS has its
own addBuffers command but FACC
treat buffers as a common pool, while
AddBuffers assigns buffers to a speciﬁc
drive. FACC, ASDG claim, will also
search 2048 i n  the same time as
AddBuffers will just 16.
Because FACC II supports Fast
Memory, the more add-on memory
you have, the better the improvement
in performance. (Add-on memory is
always Fast Memory.) It also clears
buffers intelligently s o  t h a t
applications don't crash)
To install FACCII it is suggested
that FACC II and LIBS.ASDG are
copied to your usual work disk. If this
YOUR AMIGA may 1988

is an A500 Workbench then there isn't
enough space. You will certainly have
to get rid o f the demos drawer and
perhaps the utilities drawer to make
room.
FACC II can be accessed from the
CU or Workbench (slightly restricted
form). The former is via Satisfacction,
the latter via Facetion! These tools
allow the number o f buffers to  be
changed.
Also on the disk and one for your
System drawer i s  Sysmon, a n
unrelated program which displays
behind the scenes data such as RAM
used and processes in action.
ASDG have gone for disk based
documentation and very good it is with
user and programmer manuals in their
appropriate drawers. Full details are
given on installing FACC I I  with
example command lines and startup
sequence te xt. There i s  also a
demonstration.
The speeding up to Amiga disk
access can be nothing hut good and
I experienced no problems with the
programs I used while FACC II was
installed. A simple benchmark of the
extra speed was the opening i n
sequence o f all the drawers on my
Gizmoz disk. Each window has a
number of icons to display and the
time taken was halved with FACC II
installed.

K-Spread2
Yet another spreadsheet fo r the
Amiga, th i s ti me  fr o m  English
software company Kuma. K-Spread2
was one of the ﬁrst programs available
for the Atari ST and it's the ﬁrst British
spreadsheet fo r  the Amiga. I t  is
released in the wake of Analyse! and
Maxiplan from the USA.
Cheapest of the three at 09.00, K-
Spread2 lacks some of the advanced
facilities o f  its rivals, notably the
programming languages. However K-
Spread 2 does use th e  Intuition
(WIMP) interface, provides block
move and copy, table lookup facilities
and macros.
Kuma's claim that K-Spread2 is
easy to use and will take only brief
training before full use can be made
of it as a valid one. K-Spread2 however
is a little unusual in its presentation
with one window for entering data and
manipulating functions and one
window for the sheet itself. The latter
can be resized o r  scrolled. Each
window has a separate set of pull-down
menus which become active when the
window is clicked.
K-Spread2 also provides business
graphics i n  line, horizontal/ vertical
clustered bar and horizontal/ vertical
stacked bar charts.
Printer support is ingeniously
This original package from Meridian
Software allows you to record, edit
and replay sequences of commands or
"happenings". Demonstrator can be
used from the CIA or the Workbench,
in which it uses the "info" item tool
types to set parameters. It can record
key strokes and mouse moves and
recordings can be made to  loop
continuously.
There are "terse" and "verbose"
modes of recording. On playback, the
former completes a sequence in rapid
jumps while the latter shows the
complete sequence of actions and is
used for "demonstrating" applications.
A trade mark of Meridian is the
hotkey control o f  their programs.

utilised i n  Demonstrator to  start,
pause and exit record or playback. A
status window can be displayed.

Amiga Games
Ninja Mission
h no. I hear you groan, not another Kung Fu/Martial
0
Arts ﬁghting game! But the nice thing about Ninja mission is
the price. Where some software vendors have been charging
full price for their games, Ninja Mission is under LID- a price
more suited to Commodore 64 games.
It's the same old scenario though - you have to enter a
building, and systematically kill all the inhabitants, collect a
few items and get the hell out, However in this case your
opponents are fully trained Ninja ﬁghters - thugs (in the
ancient sense of the word) and a special bit at the end of the
game (at least I think it is).
Add to this the fact that these ﬁghters also start throwing
darts and stars (shuriken), and you have a recipe for total
mayhem on an Amiga scale.
The nice part is that if you kill an opponent and he is of
the throwing star type (sorry I can't think of a better way of
putting it) then he will drop his stars, leaving it up to you and
his companions to ﬁght over the stars, ending up with a lot of
dead bodies.
The game isn't without i ts faults -  some sleepy
programming creeps in whereby the dead bodies are piled up
in the opposite end of the room when you re-enter it at a later
date. Another "fault" is that on some occasions the music
and the ﬁghting stops. leaving you to ﬁght with no feedback
whatsoever.
Apart from these "hitches" I can say that Ninja Mission
is a good game, not brilliant. but good -  and deﬁnitely
something to keep in mind if you are looking for this sort of
thing Otherwise avoid it like the plague.

from cannon bases and a massive destructor ship that comes
down from the top of the screen -just when you don't want it

The aim of the game is naturally enough, to destroy
everything i n  sight, destroy all o f  the swirling alien
formation ﬂying ships, cover as much terrain as possible,
and look after the reserves of energy and ﬁrepower whenever
possible.
There are a few nice touches, such as the sampled speech
and the effective, albeit brief, animated "wink" b u t then it
lets itself down by 15 seconds of disk grinding - oh well, it
gives me enough time to snap open a cherry coke!
What makes this game a little different are the various
symbols that are dotted over the terrain. Fly over these and
you earn a number of defences: invisibility, more power.
transposed controls (a nasty one that), and a whole host of
other items, some of which are useful, others just a pain in
the butt.
After the ﬁrst level, it becomes clear that this is a game
for people with a good memory - or with a map. There is a
promise of a screen construction set in the near future which
doesn't excite me very much (does it you?).
To be honest, there are so many of these games of this
genre around already. I don't know why Microdeal bothered
releasing Insanity Fight. It is an exceptionally crass shoot'em
up with very little to offer above that of better versions such
as their excellent Goldrunner released a couple of months
back.
Sorry Microdeal, you can and have, done better than
this.

releases for the Amiga - but with XR-35 they are clearly out
to make value for money games.
There isn't a story with this game (thankfully) and the
idea is to shoot anything and everything that ﬂies towards
you. The basic story line is similar to a hundred and one
other games, but the sprites are wonderfully detailed (as they

The booklet supplied with the game gives some clap trap
about a computer going berserk and you, as ever, having to
thwart the rogue machine's attempts at killing you!
All this is utterly unnecessary and gets in the way of a
smashing game -  the graphics are fast, the animation is
rerninicent of the good old days of Atary's Pole Position, and
the challenge is infuriatingly addictive.

should be), the backgrounds scroll past you very smoothly,
with some very nasty looking "missiles" that don't do you
any good should you come into contact with them.
The sprite animation is probably the fastest I have seen in
a long time, but what really lets this game down is the time
consuming disk loading between games. I mean is this really
necessary Anco? A 5 I2K machine reduced to 20 seconds of
gear crunching between every game?
X R-35 looks more and more like the Coin Op classic
"Salamander" the deeper you go into the game; the waves of
ﬁreballs. the formation of aliens, the claws in sector three. In
fact the more I  go back to XR-35 the better I get at
Salamander (Hey, I'm not complaining)!
The most amazing thing about XR-35 is the fact that this
game is a budget release. There is a lot of game here as well,
so the chances are very unlikely that you will play this game
from one end to the other. At ﬁrst though it takes a lot of
playing to get even past the ﬁrst sector, let alone ﬁnish all
twelve sectors.
At £9.95 for this fast. sideways scrolling shoot *ern up,
XR-35 looks to be one of the best value for money games
there is for the Amiga. If there was a game of the month for
the Amiga, then this would be it!

You are a ball (I know it seems hard to imagine it) but
inside the ball is a laser gun turret. It is up to you to shoot out
the rogue blocks that make up the walls and sides of the
road, thereby stopping the electric fence that will blow you
up if you go through the blue arcing without your shields up.
In order to ﬁre out the blocks in the wall, you have to lower
your shields - sneaky huh?
That is essentially all there is to the game other than the
fact that it is very hard to play. and therefore very addictive.
There are satellites that loom up on the sides to occasionally
take pot shots at you with their lasers (you had best shoot
these out o f the sky) and balls that ﬂy towards you -
occasionally turning into missiles!
Forget the story line as it is clearly an afterthought.
Roadwars is an addictive game with some good, but
unimpressive graphics. It looks pretty much the same on the
Atari ST so I think you can see why the graphics aren't being
used to the full.
With the occasional "inhabitant" shooting at you from
behind, and some simple music, Roadwars is deﬁnitely a
winner in my book.

uestion: i f  you have some excellent screens (either
drawn or digitised) for the Amiga but wanted to make some
money, how would you do it?
A
Art of Chess from SPA features every conceivable gimmick
when it comes to offering playing options.
The board can be two or three dimensional. You can
rotate it to whatever angle you like. The colours of the board
can be changed to suit your mood or interior decoration
scheme. The shape of the pieces can be changed and you can
even introduce your OWn designs, providing you have a copy
of DeluxePaint to produce them. Other features include a
voice commentary and an optional performance meter
which claims to show who is winning although it  only
measures material. not position.

much they are actually necessary or whether they are just
there to cover up deﬁciencies in the playing side of the
program. Who actually uses them? Of course, we all play with
them when the program is ﬁrst loaded in. or we are showing

Answer: put a version of Breakout over it and call it Ball
Raider!
This is not a quality game. Ball Raider is simply a version
of Breakout/Arkanoid/Itnpact w it h a  pretty series o f
illustrations to give you a reason for ﬁnishing a screen.
The blocks you are supposed to knock away, obscure the
painting beneath it, so in order to see the whole screen you
have to knock them away!
This is not quality software, it is pretty to look at, but
other than that, it is squeezing every last drop out of a well
and truly worn out format for a game. That there is a reason
to knock those damn blocks out of the way is a ﬁrst. but I
reckon somewhere, someone is rubbing their hands together
thinking of all the money they arc making out of poor people
who have bought this trash.
If you want a version of Breakout. try Impact instead -
now there's a game with a challenge.

down to playing a game, I suspect that ninety plus per cent of
users opt for the clearest image which is the old fashioned 2-
E) top down view.
When you actually get down to playing the game, the
computer's skill level can be set by adjusting the time it
thinks for  each move. The slider scale ranges from ten
seconds to ﬁve minutes but you can opt for a no limit setting
in which the Amiga will think for as long as you want it to.
One nice idea that I had not previously come across was a
second slider control that determines how aggressively your
opponent plays.
At any stage of the game. you can check on how a given
square is  being attacked o r  defended. You can move
backwards and forwards through the moves played so far.
There is no hint facility as such but you can always swap
sides, see what the Amiga does and then swap back again.
Positions can be set up for  problem solving or later
examination and games can always be saved. Thirty sample
games are included on disk for you to examine at your leisure
but there is no commentary saying what was special about
them, so beginners are not going to get a great deal from
them.
Menu control was not as simple as it should have been;
some o f  the commands were somewhat obscure and the
program crashed on me several times.
As far as playing strength goes, the Art of Chess, like all
similar programs is difﬁcult to assess as my budget does not
stretch to two Amigas to play rival programs against each
other. Nor does the (limited) documentation give any details
on the size of its opening library or any indication of an
approximate rating at different time levels. From a purely
personal point of view. I felt that Chessimister 2000 from
Software Toolworks offered me a better game and was much
the better presented package.

Space Ranger
G A ME S R E V I E W S

the theme music for Space Ranger (or "Save the Teddies" as
we call it) is forming yet another background for the long
winter nights that are slowly drawing to a close. It is another
Mastertronic cheapie and is a clever reworking on the old
Defender idea, where monsters come down from the sky to
steal inhabitants of some unknown world.
The difference is that instead of ships there are monsters;
instead o f  little stick men, there are now animals and
creatures, and instead of lots of monsters coming to steal the
animals, there is just one "T " shaped ediﬁce that sucks the
creatures into itself — relying on the monsters to drag the
animals under the space ship.
Your task is to k ill all o f  the monsters but not the
animals.
Easy? Don't kid yourself. perhaps I forgot to mention the
fact that the space ship and the monsters retaliate, throwing
snowballs, spinning stars, ﬁsts (I) and all are extremely well
animated. At higher levels, the games become harder with
more creatures to rescue, more animals to kill or avoid, and
SO On.
Nice features about this game are the scrolling multi-
layer backgrounds, the simple and effective muzak, the great
animation. and the Teddies! I ' m  sorry, but for  me the
Teddies are a  v ital par t o f  this game. and rescuing
them from the nasty baddies gives me cause for concern,
after all what would you do if your teddy was whisked away!
Space Ranger is a very good game— not original, hut as it
is one of Mastertronics' latest budget priced games. I think I
am willing to overlook the matter. Certainly as it stands, the
game could do with some improvements— 30 seconds of disk
crunching between levels is beginning to really bug me! A
shame as there are no real complaints about this nicely
presented game. Heck — I even devoted the best part of six
cherry cokes while playing the game. A recommendation? I
should say so!
My Teddy agrees.

Backlash
F
the Amiga! In an unassuming tacky box with an equally
tacky piece of artwork sporting the cover, this game looked
to all intents and purposes the prime dingbat game of the
month b u t  upon loading it_ Backlash w o n  m e  Over
completely.
The game is simple — you are driving very fast across a
scrolling terrain. There are occasionally small pyramids to
stop you driving in one direction forever.
Now we get to the good stuff! There are silos dotted
around, and out of these come all sorts of creatures, ﬂying
saucers and the like. They shoot missiles at you and your
task ( o f  course) is  t o  dodge them and destroy y our
opponents.
The graphics ar e excellent. Solid 3 D  shaped w ith
shadows and very smooth ﬂicker-free movements. The
explosions are loud (!) as are most of the sound effects,
especially the constant tirade of bouncing bombs that you
ﬁre bouncing off into the distance if they don't hit anything.
The waves of opponents naturally get nastier as the game
progresses. The screens all change colour to show that you
have destroyed one wave, followed by an intermediate wave.
Occasionally there is a missile that dodges and serves all
attempts at your moving out of the way or blowing it to
kingdom come, and it takes skill to shoot it a higher levels.
This would have been the perfect shoot 'em up for the
Amiga, had there been a little more variety to the game. As it
is, the game gets a little repetitive towards level ten and it is a
shame that there aren't aliens to destroy — as it is. there are
about ten different types in all.
If you like to marvel at the excellent programming and
t
this game, and a fast example of w
probably the game is for you. Fast graphics, loud and dirty
sound effects all make for a good game — a few more features
and this would have been perfect.

who has recently upgraded from
a Commodore 64 to an Amiga,
and who is thinking of downgrading
again, is that they are living in fantasy
land! But the idea is not as stupid as it
ﬁrst sounds. At least Ready Soft Inc.
don't think so.
They have just released the 64
Emulator which allows the user to run
their old 64 programs on their Amigas.
Well, some of them anyway but more
of that anon,
What You Get
The key to know the works o f the
program lies in the serial interface — a
cable that connects the parallel port of
an Amiga to a 1541, 1571 or similar
disk drive. Amiga 1000 users must
ensure that they get the right edge
connector (it is slightly different from
the 500/2000 model). You will also
need Kickstart 1.2 and 5 I2 K o f
memory.

What You Can Do
The Emulator allows you to use Amiga
disks as well as 64 drives. Standard 3
disks, hard disks and temporary RAM
ﬁles can be used, It should be noted
that t o  use R A M  requires one
megabyte of memory and not all hard
drives are compatible. Minus points to
Ready Soft Inc. for not saying which
ones.
The 1020 5
used but you still need a 1541. etc to
read the ﬁles initially.
Amiga drives may be kept as
standard Amiga or toggled to 1541
emulation. Emulation mode restricts
the amount of space available on the
disk as a standard 1541 disk but is
likely to result in higher compatibility.
A transfer program is included to help
you swap your ﬁles over from 5
to 31/2" disks. Either the entire disk or
selected ﬁles can be copied although
the program may not work if the ﬁles
are copy protected.
Printers and Amiga modems can
be selected in the same way as disk
drives, but 64 modems such as the 1650
won't work.
All these instructions are easily
changed using a pop-up conﬁguration
menu and once you have tailored the
system t o  s u i t y o u r  hardware
requirements, y o u r  customised
conﬁguration can b e  permanently
saved.
Occasionally, there will be conﬂicts
when two peripherals require the same
port simultaneously, e.g. the Emulator
interface a n d  a  parallel printer
interface. The software will prompt
you for the device that is currently
required.
Other items that can be changed
from the conﬁgurator menu include
control devices — joysticks, mice,
lightpens and paddles. There is a faster
monochrome mode i f  graphics are

unimportant together with an optional
improved character set.
What Works
Not every program fo r the 64 is
compatible with the system but by the
same token, you wouldn't want to run
all your programs this way.
Most utilities will load and run
with no trouble at all. Superscript,
GEOS, PaperClip and Printshop are
all compatible.
Games however are a  different
proposition with their fast loaders and
extra protection devices. Games that I
could load include Infocom's titles and
Guild o f  Thieves fro m Magnetic
Scrolls. I  can't really see anyone
wanting to try anything other than
adventures as arcade games both run
alot slower (2-5 times) and tend to
suffer from some horrible ﬂickering in
the graphics, especially when a lot of
sprites are close together. The most
recent arcade that I could get to load
was Lode Runner which was released a
couple o f years ago. Modern games
from US Gold, Electronic games that I
had transferred to disk using a Freeze
Frame cartridge.
Conclusions
So who would ﬁnd 6 4  Emulator
useful? Certainly not the games player!
However, for anyone who has a lot of
word processing or data base ﬁles and
is wondering whether o r  n o t t o
upgrade either software or machine,
the 64 Emulator could just help to tip
the decision.

 AiR T  is an innovative
pro / l i n g  structure called a frame.
Frames are represented o n  the

numbered starting from I  up to 75.
Inside each frame are 75 cells; these
cells are used t o  store icons that

All of these are generated as Raw

combination DigiView. Overwhelm-

for although the Amiga can't display

immediately blends the couple -of
million down to a manageable four
thousand and ninety-six. To prove it to
you the software displays two graphs
under the title Histogram. One is
marked Raw Data. It graphs the two
million colours. The other graphs
Adjusted Data or the blended down
colours.
Here is where the Amiga ﬂaunts its
superiority over what is presently
available in MSDOS on IBM's costing
much more. Only with the new CGA
and VGA adapters can IBM even
approach the greater colour display of
the Amiga. With these adapters they
can display 256 colours in the 320X200
resolution mode. With Digi View and
DigiPaint the Amiga uses HAM tL)
show all 4096 colours in the hi-res
mode of 320X400!
Without using HAM. the Amiga
(with its highest resolution lull-screen
of 672X444 and using 16 colours) is
wider and slightly less deep than IBM's
VGA adapter's hi-res 640X480 and 16
colours.
If you wish to display black and
white photographs. DigiView has a
special hi-res mode for doing just that
and it is done superbly! You will ﬁnd it
tempting, however, to manipulate the
photos, swapping heads and bodies of
beach snapshots of Friends. (This may
be dangerous to your health!)
Why not work all the time in Digi-
Pa int with these 4096 colours at your
disposal? To be perfectly frank, the
painting tools of DigiPaint are better
suited to a  ﬁnal manipulation and
touch-up of your image. It does much
that DPaintll cannot do. It acts like a
magic colour glazing brush, adding a
little colour here, glazing down a

The A iR T  editor is  a  graphics

The editor resides in the drawer for

- Compiling a  program does not
take a long time, when it is loaded it
initially opens a window displaying the
version number of the compiler. The
compilation process takes lust t w o
passes (as far as I can work out). The
ﬁrst pass being a simple check of the
syntax, a look at the variables, and a
translation of all the ﬁelds deﬁned in
the program, the second pass is the full
compilation.
At all times the compiler is telling
you what is going on (which is a good
thing) and the code that is produced at
the end of the successful compilation
executes with n o  discernable bugs.

DPaintII, on the other hand, is a
miraculous workhorse. I t  gives its
owner one of the most creative sets of
instruments ever available to the artist.
The combination of the two programs
seems to enable one to emulate the
approaches o f artists from the past
ranging from the delicate glazes o f
Titian to the wild impasto swirls of
Van Gogh.
In spite of the ﬂicker (which can be
tamed considerably with a sheet o f
grey perspex cut to ﬁt your monitor —
or one o f the proprietary anti-glare
screens s u c h  a s  S u n c o m •s
GlareDown12 which ﬁts the Amiga
1080 monitor), many artists prefer the
interlaced mode o f  300 x  400 i n
DPaintIl. In this mode you have the
vertical resolution as the hi-res mode
plus the full 32 colours. When you load
this mode into DigiView, it slips in
with no change o f  image size o r
proportion. If you work in hi-res 640 x
400 and bring it into DigiPaint 320 x
400. the 640 is compressed into 320 but
some of the 4096 colours make up for
the loss of resolution...so... you have
AR T P A C K A G E S
what is effectively a 640X400 hi-res
image displaying 4096 plus colours.
Yes, 4096 plus colours since there are
still more colours achieved with a
dithering control.
Let i t  b e  known th a t such
manipulations don't come cheaply.
They eat memory voraciously. Don't
even think o f  the hi-res modes if  you
don't have a  megabyte tucked away
somewhere. Any more than a megabyte
doesn't help due to the way the Amiga
1000 manages its graphics. In addition
to the advantages to DPaintl hi-res,
the "spare page" (hit key J) is usually
available since it swaps in and out of
the megabyte of Fast Ram. When in
DPaintll you can check on memory
available by hitting CTRL and "A".
To summarise the previous two
paragraphs concerning resolution
modes and screen swaps between the
two programs; you can load any
DPaintll image into any DigiPaint
and correct for a correctly presented
image.. .or distort the DPaintll one
for a creative effect. However, once
into DigiPaint you cannot go back into
DPaintli!

Fortunately a new program allows
you t o  d o  that, and also further
manipulation to IFF ﬁles, Butcher by
Eagle Tree Software, P.O. Box 164,
Hopewell, VA 23860 USA (804) 452-
0623 is a graphics program for the
Amiga designed to complement paint
programs, and digitisers reads the
blurb on the disk jacket, Butcher also
does Edge Mapping, makes a halftone
picture o f  black and white dots,
generates unusual colour effects such
as positive-negative reversals,
complementary colours, false colours,
toning, separations, and will enable
you to design any shape you desire for
displaying a picture as a mosaic of that
shape. This mosaic feature makes any
Amiga owner an instant stained glass
designer. You can also turn your
images into needle point or tapestry
designs! More sophisticated utilities
are included. The program makes
histograms o f colour register usage,
sorts registers, examine bit-planes and
many more miracles.
A ﬁnal tip about DPaintli mode
changes. It seems that you can "change
up w i th  a loss in size of the total
image, but be careful the way you
change a hi-res down to a low-res. By
switching numbers o f colours in the
low-res mode to match or lower than
the palette used in hi-res, you can have
that hi-res image as a quadruple size
image which may be scanned with the
arrow keys, Try working on the image
in this magniﬁcation,then relocate it in
hi-res usine, Screen Format Requester.
Starting an Image
Then where shall you get the images to
manipulate? That is where our ﬁrst
tool comes in. It is an image grabber
from NewTec called DigiView which
will put any two dimensional picture
you digitise with a TV camera using
their colour wheel RGB ﬁlters into an
UT' tile compatible with most Amiga
graphic programs. (The preferred
camera with clear instructions on its
use are discussed in the new User's
Manual supplied b y  NewTec. A n
excellent article on the whole system
was published b y  th e  technical
computer magazine Byte in March
1987.) We owe the ﬁle standardisation
to Electronic Art's development of the
ﬁle stru ctu re  called I F F ,  o r
Interchange File Format. If you want
to read more about IFF structure,
Amiga Technical Support offers a
manual called The Electronics Arts
IFF 85 Manual for 820. You get both

documents and a disk. Contact Kim
Montgomery, 1200 Wilson Drive,
West Chester. PA. 19380 USA.)
New developments by program-
mers at the World's Biggest Computer
Magazine (two pounds, four and three
quarters ounces b y  weight — one
hundred thirty cubic inches by volume
and called Computer Shopper) have
gone even further with interchanging
ﬁle formats. Th e  October issue
contained information on a  Public
Domain program which will swap
images between the Amiga. Atari
ST(SS) and MSDOS.
There is also a new program which
will interchange objects between
Sculpt 3D, Videoscape 3D and Forms
in Flight. It is called Interchange and
was developed by John Foust who was
the Technical Editor o f  Amazing
Computing which i s a  very good
Amiga magazine with a professional
slant towards programming. These
video programs will have to wait their
turn in this series.
Hand Done Images
DigiView has brought photographic
imaging to  the Amiga user for a
reasonable cost. There is, however, the
rich world o f  hand manipulation
imaging. The new Summagraphics
tablets which have now joined Easy!
with Amiga compatible digitising
boards, make the transfer from pencil
and paper to computer screen drawing
simple. Having used a Koala digitising
tablet o n  the Commodore 64 fo r
several years. the mouse on my Amiga
was an awkward tool when I ﬁrst tried
to draw freehanded. The high prices of
the digitising tablets forced me to stick
with the mouse.
Reaction speeds of the mouse can
be controlled from Preferences on the
Workbench. The surface on which you
operate the mouse are also a factor in
its control. Try the differences between
a polished desktop, a  regular
rubberised mouse pad and the slight
foam texture of some plastics which
add friction to the pull of the ball. An
occasional cleaning of the mouse ball
may be needed. Be sure to follow your
manual's instructions accurately.
Much of the work using Digipaint
must be done with the commands
FILL and MODE menu Shading. You
must trace the outline of' the area you
wish to modify by using the one pixel
brush. This brush gets progressively
difﬁcult to control as you proceed with
the drawing. You may prefer to use
ART P A C K A G E S
short segments of the Straight Line
icon drawing tool, clicking L EFT
mouse button after each segment to
form a continuous contour under a
steadier control. The Right Mouse
button sets the line.
Since Shading is such a powerful
modiﬁcation tool to bring the richness
of 4096 colours to your 320x400 image
started in DPaintII, use it fully. When
you select Shading, the MENU line
will display a thin long box called
Dither Control. To  its right is the
Position B o x  which displays the
position of the greatest density of the
colour with which you have chosen to
shade. There is a small solid square in
the centre when you ﬁrst activate the
feature. Drag it with the LEFT button
to the spot where you want the heaviest
concentration o f  the colour. The
density will feather out on your image
from the spot both horizontally and
vertically. If you want shading strictly
horizontally or vertically, move over
to the directional arrows at the right
and click one of them off to reveal a
bar inside the Position Box replacing
the tiny square. That bar will be either
a horizontal or vertical band. Shift it to
place your density where you choose.
Hidden in the command AND of
Digipaint is a colour separation utility
which a r t i s t s  w o r k i n g  w i t h
autographics (handmade prints, i.e.
silkscreen, block prints, lithos and
etchings) will ﬁnd very useful if they
want to try three colour printing. The
56 page manual o f DigiPaint fully
explains the above procedure as well as
the operating instructions fo r  the
program. NewTec. by hiding the secret
password f o r  DigiPa int therein.
requires you to  keep that manual
before you a t all times. As with
Marauder II, the ﬁne copy program,
one must look up a page number, a line
and a word in the book to answer the
question asked before the protection is
lifted. Unlike Marauder, who has gone
to a built-into-the-program page, line,
word list, NewTec's book must always
be consulted.
A Step By Step Procedure
The January Your Amiga cover, Space
Invaders, was designed on its side to be
used as a vertical. I  used a tricky
technique in DigiPaint to get this one.
First, a grid was made with DPaintll
and tilted into a perspective which was
spiffed-up with the anti-alia sing mode.
Then, it was merged from the second
place screen o f a blended blue and
YOUR AMIGA may 1988
22
black sky made in the HAM mode of
DigiPaint. Th e  little space ships
*arrived and started ﬁring their rays
after I discovered the tricks of blending
those pearly glass bubbles. They were
drawn w i th  th e  circle icon a n d
modiﬁed with FILL and Shading.
Another hand made image, the
Woo Ladies i s  a  blend using
RubThhru i n  DigiPaint. The nude
man was digitised fro m a  large
charcoal drawing. The ladies were
duplicated a n d  modiﬁed fr o m  a
painting of one lady done using the
Aegis Paint program. They were
loaded to DigiPaint's 320)6400 and
from SWAP copied to the back spare
screen. Using Rub Thru from the menu
the ladies were revealed through the
black front screen by using the oval
icon. Later, in a similar manner, the
man was revealed onto the front screen
with a free-form use of the large spot
brush.
Balloon Landings started as a
DPaintll perspective exercise i n
HIRES using 16 colours. Half of these
colours were used in a spread of values
for the browns and half for the blues.
The range for each was then used to ﬁll
the perspective grids. Later, saved and
transferred, the 4096 colours of Digi-
Paint HAM added the ﬁery colours of
the landing pit and the cool colours of
the balloons. Note the balloon high
lights done with the combination small
square density placement of Shading.
The enlarged pixels of the balloon with
its pixel people in the foreground are
purposely enlarged with Butcher to
contrast with the tiny pixels of the rest
of the distant balloons.
More ways o f  using these two
programs together continue to suggest
themselves. If you have any difﬁculty
in understanding some o f the more
complex operations discussed in the
use o f DigiPaint and DeluxePaintll
may I guide you toward the interactive
tutorials published b y RGB Video
Creations, 2574 PGA Blved., Suite
104, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida
33410. H B  Marketing o f Feltham,
Middlesex, U.K. should be handling
them soon. They call th e  series

published disks fo r DPaintil, and

the-road-a-piece, using th e  same
tutorial interaction, will be programs

programs in the near future.

Starboard 2 - probably the best memory upgrade for the Amiga Series.
Why do we  think the starboard Is the best memory board on the Amiga? Well, ﬁrstly you can
use it on a ll 3  models of the Amiga (There is an A500 and an A1000 version of the Starboard
and you can ge l a n A2000 adaptor ol either version it  you upgrade) N'Os, can have versions
with OK,  512K, 1M B or 2MB RAM . and each version is upgredeable so you can use your own
RAM chips if you like There is also the Option to use a 08801 maths co-processor, partly checked
RAM, 'Sticky' RAM-Disc and onboard clock and there is also a hard disc controller to ﬁt inside
the Starboard at under E100 due out soon. You can also have upto 4 Starboards connected together
to make upto 9MB Total RAM.
This is just a M • i  description of what the Starboard can do, phone or write for more detailks

T
he Amiga's famed graphics
capabilities have always been
renowned. All machines in the
Amiga range have a number of high
resolution modes available, and with a
minimum of 5I2K in modern Amigas,
it is not surprising to see a number of
really special graphics packages at last
becoming available for this powerful
machine.
Sulpt 3D is an interesting package
in that i t is not a purely art based
package, neither is it a typical design
package (for example CAD). Sculpt
3D enables the user to draw on the
screen in freehand, but in any one of
three projections (as is common with
technical drawings). I t  just about
allows photographic control over the
rendered image. b y  positioning
"lamps" at certain places (either on or
off the screen) thus generating literally
G R A P H I C S
Sculpt 3D
An innovative graphics package that takes a lot of the
hard work out of drawing in perspective
By Mary Branscombe
thousands, perhaps millions, o f
possible shades and depth changes.
What is Sculpt 3D?
Sculpt 3D can best be described as an
interactive solid modelling editor,
combined with ray tracing software to
generate very realistic images on the
screen. This means that Sculpt 3D can
be used t o  construct a  computer
simulation of any solid shape you care
to i ma g i n e . Th e re  i s n ' t  a n y
conventional parallel I  can use to
explain th e  design process, b u t
something in the vein o f  "carving
shapes Out of solid air" will probably
do.
Details are something Sculpt 3D
takes care o f quite well -  shades,
shadows and perspectives are all

handled by the editor. Because the
drawing is created on a three screen
"board" on the screen, painting a
picture must b e  methodical a n d
planned - you will have to work out
things such as depth and angles for
yourself, but hidden line removal and
perspectives can all be handled.
First Steps
The most important thing is to make
sure you have a backup of the disk up
and running with a  copy o f  the
Workbench. I f  you have a 5I2K in
order to reach Sculpt 3D's unstated
minimum of one Megabyte, you can
use Sculpt with a 512K Amiga (for
example, a basic Amiga 500) as I have
done, but rendering images, drawing
screens and using the high resolution

he
!en
a
nd
for
nd
modes are made much simpler when
using this package on an Amiga with
the one Megabyte upgrade. A  dual
drive is also a boon as there is some
disk swapping from time to time.
Once you have booted up the disk
and you are inside the ﬁrst level of
Sculpt 3D, you are presented with
three windows, which is called "Tri
View". This i s  a  necessity a s a
computer can only represent images as
3D on a ﬂat 2D screen. In order to
actually draw in 3D, you need to
display images i n  orthographic
projection, hence the Tri  Viewer's
approach of front, sides and top view
that form part of the complete image.
Each window has a  series o f
gadgets that are used to reposition the
image in each view, each window has a
blue cross, and within each window
you can zoom in or out of a picture
thus resealing the image to your own
size. Naturally all windows can be
resized t o  accommodate larger o r
more detailed drawings as and when
necessary.
If you have enough money, (i.e.
one Megabyte or more), you can run
other packages a t the same time.
Sculpt 3 D  supports th e  Amiga
"Intuition" multitasking environment,
so it is possible to run a wordprocessor
or a few tools from the workbench or
any other desktop alongside Sculpt
ike

.
 I have found that it is a good idea
UP 
t
o
 have th e  "Notepad" a n d  a
:he " c a l c u l a t o r "  in the RAM disk as you
in d r a w .
ted 
A
 word of warning though, Sculpt
an 
3
D
 is not fast. Because o f the very
for c o m p l e x  drawing calculations being
tve p e r f o r m e d ,  running a wordprocessor
ing 
a
t
 the same time as Sculpt 3D will slow
.on t h i n g s  down even more than normal. A
standard r a y  trace o f  a  conical
pyramid (i.e. a simple object) will take
a few minutes to compute, but with
something a little more complex (like
the famous byte by byte juggling man
demo) these can take literally days per
ﬁa me
However, i f  you have had any
experience of technical drawing. then
you will ﬁnd Sculpt 3D's approach
delightfully simple.
Menu Operations
Most o f  the commands issued to
Sculpt 3D are made through the use of
icons, windows and pulldown menus.
To make the menus visible, press the
right hand mouse button down and
hold i t down. The menus show up
G R A P H IC S
(typically enough) as a bar along the
top of the screen as PROJECT, EDIT,
TOOLS. OBSERVER, and WORLD.
To see more of the menu choices you
move the pointer over the word in the
same way you would by operating
Workbench.
Probably the ﬁrst thing you will
want to do is load in a picture that is
ready made for you to  play with.
Sculpt 3D has a few, but not many, and
the few that are supplied on the master
disk are very simple examples of how
to design simple objects like the coffee
cup or the small house.
A "scene" consists o f  separate
entities such as "lamps", "observer",
"world" and "objects". You can load
in all of these or only one of them if you
like — personally at this stage it is good
to load in all items bar the "lamps"
information. Try and experiment with
single light sources to see how effective
the shadowing system really is!
It is now possible to go to the Tri
View and have a look at the complete
image of the house. By altering your
position and relative distance to the
house, you can walk around it. and
even go inside the house — with a little
care!
The backgrounds are interesting in
that Sculpt 3D actually draws shadows
in perspective, but should you want the
idea of perspective made really clear,
you could always use the checkered
pattern supplied (as part o f  the
package) as a ﬂoor or even as a "sky".
Some really weird effects can be
achieved by using both with mutually
opposing checkered patterns, so they
meet up somewhere on the horizon —
it'll screw up your retinas, but what a
nice way to go!
The concept of having a "sky" on
the screen is an interesting one, in that
it is a horizon bisecting the screen
somewhere in the middle. This can be
altered so that the line appears more or
less anywhere on the screen so the
eventual surroundings are very
spacious to begin with.
Of the supplied "tools" Sculpt 3D
has for drawing. there are many for
distorting basic shapes, so , f o r
example it is very easy to create lovely
rolling hills on a surface by creating a
"disk" (a circle with no depth) and
then rip up a few chinks of "earth" by
pulling it out with a "magnet". This
has the advantage of making shapes
very natural, a n d  i f  yo u  w a n t
undulating shapes (perhaps for the
features of a face) then this is a very
useful tool. However be warned — this
is probably the most memory greedy
YOUR AMIGA may 1988
27
and time consuming task you Cdli give
to Sculpt 3D to calcuIate.
Naturally there are other tools that
enable you to distort shapes. Out of the
other gadgets, the most interesting is
the facility to naturally curve a shape
(ideal for rounding off ends) and for
extruding (similar to the magnet — but
this time the "extrude" tool ﬁrst
performs a ﬁll operation, if possible,
and then duplicates the selected object
and then links the duplicated and the
selected object). For these operations
the "dragger" is used in one or more of
the Tri View windows so that you can
create tubes, poles, blocks o r  any
upright or ﬂat regular shape. Even a
high-rise block can be made from an
extruded slab.
But the shape distortion tools are
not all that Sculpt 31) has to offer. The
Observer tools are also very useful
because they can alter the overall
image — as if you were looking at the
whole picture and not just speciﬁc
items (as you are doing when just using
tools). The Observer Painting Mode
sets the observer to paint mode thereby
enabling you to cover a face with a
single colour without using shading or
depth effects.
In this mode, shadows are not
rendered. Because Sculpt 3D has to
calculate the effects of these on the ray
trace, leaving out shadows (at the
initial design phase) is a quick way of
producing an image after its wire
frame draft
Snapshot Observer Mode sets the
observer in a mode which creates a ray-
traced image which excludes the effect
of shadows. The time taken to produce
an image is proportional to the image
size, so small images can be produced
much quickly than larger images. This
is something to bear in mind when
drawing out an image d o  you want a
large image full of detail that takes ﬁve
minutes (and probably longer) to
compute, o r do you just want the
general picture (thereby cutting the
compute time down to a quarter.
On the Amiga there are different
modes that enable the user to specify
different resolutions f o r  different
applictions. W h i l e  t h e  H i g h
Resolution mode (60(1 x 600) utilises
the best Amiga graphics, some very
impressive effects can be rendered
using the Low Resolution modes — it'
HAM Graphics are used, they are
displayed in low resolution mode.
Sculpt 31) gives you full control
over the screen interlace. There is
adequate support for adding bit planes
with any screen mode — adding bit

planes means that the number o f
colours you select are raised by the
number o f the power o f your bit
planes. So if you are using a bit plane
number of greater than 12, then Sculpt
3D will give you the option of saving
an RGB ﬁle; 0 is the default state.
Using Sculpt 3D
This is a very impressive package and
although i t is not easy to use, it is
certainly worth sitting down fo r a
month or so and really getting to grips
with the complete package.
I would - not really recommend
using the package with a 512K Amiga
- a megabyte is a necessity should you
want to start drawing more complex
shapes and patterns using the higher
resolution modes and the HAM mode.
Sculpt 3D is an innovative drawing
package which, fo r  once, actually
enables th e  user t o  draw ve ry
impressive pictures with a reasonable
perspective calculation system and a
very impressive and easy t o  use
shadowing system. The sad thing is
that the Ray Tracing computation
time takes so long!

Ray Tracing is an innovative and
fairly new idea; you do need a lot of
memory and processing power and the
time required to  generate just one
simple ray trace is phenomenal, so be
prepared to  wait around for a few
hours i f  you are drawing complex
images consisting of many elements.
Small wonder why the package is
supplied with a "caution Ray Tracing
in Progress" card to  put on your
keyboard while th e  machine i s
calculating your picture.
I have been using Sculpt 3D for
over four months now. Initially my
attempts at drawing were pathetic. The
concept of Ray Tracing was new to me,
and I must admit the whole idea dazed
me. After all, a drawing package with
isometric calculation, shadowing,
perspective, rotational and a spacial
distortion system seemed too good to
be true. Certainly I have never come
across these facilities on a sub-:E1000
system - a DEC workstation perhaps
(you know those lovely ones that
support GPX...) but not an Amiga
1000.
My only gripe is the sluggish way
the package responds to calculations,

and I know this is because the Amiga
has -
software tools up and running, but it is
very slow. I am playing around with
the 68020 maths processor instead of
the 68000 in an attempt at speeding
things up and I will get back to you

up.
Anyway, i f  y o u  j u s t w a n t
something to paint with, then do not

Drawing in 3D requires consideration
and plenty of planning, but if you're
looking for the very best in 3D art

recommending.

packages which can usefully be
reviewed side by side. TextPro
is a wordprocessor and DataRetrieve a
database. The U K  price was not
available at the time of going to press
but the US price for each package is
$79.95.
Textpro
One of the worst things about being a
writer is when somebody gives you a
blank piece of paper and says write.
Modern technology has replaced the
paper with a blank screen but the
feeling of helplessness still remains.
thought that nothing could be worse
than this emptiness but on ﬁrst loading
Text Pro. I was in for something of a
shock. The ﬁrst thing you are asked is
how many pages you intend to write. It
is bad enough not knowing what you
are going to write about without being
asked how much! All creative ideas
ﬂew straight out of the window.
We take an in-depth look at a word
processor and a database from Abacus
By Gordon Hamlett
Because the Amiga can run several
programs simultaneously. TextPro
needs to know how much memory to
reserve for  your work. Logical I
suppose but somewhat unnerving all
the same. In practice, you can just hit
the default unless you are likely to be
doing anything unusual.
There are all the usual features
found i n  wordprocessors. T h e
packaging makes a  great play of
professional features such a s
justiﬁcation, headers and footers, bold
and italic scripts etc., etc. but I would
be very disappointed i f  any W P
package in this price range did not
include them.
All these features can be controlled
either from pull down menus or via the
keyboard. There are four main menus
— ﬁle, edit, style and formatting. The
menus worked well and were largely
self-explanatory s o  that ﬂicking
through the instruction manual was
kept to a minimum. Good points for
simplicity.

Missing Features
There were a  number of  features
missing that I would have liked to see
included and some quirks among those
that were. As a journalist, lack of a
wordcount was immediately apparent.
There was also no facility to link ﬁles
together when printing so that each
chapter of your novel must be run off
individually. There is no spelling
checker which may be had news for
some people, especially as it seems that
spelling is no longer taught in schools.
Quirks include the automatic
hyphenation — I found that I had to go
back and make too many Corrections—
and I would prefer that this was set to
off rather than on, initially. The searq
and replace function only highlighted
the ﬁrst letter of the word or phrase
rather than the whole thing. On one
occasion. the word I was looking for
was hidden under the requester box
asking me if I wanted to look for the
next occurrence. As I couldn't see the

current one T h e s e  are just quirks
though. It all depends on what you are
used to.
TextPro supports a wide range of
printers and there are facilities to set
up your own control characters i f
Yours is not on the list given.
Another feature that some might
ﬁnd useful is the ability to include
graphics in the text. A  copy o f the
utility BTS nap is included with the
package. Graphics can be inserted into
the text or overlayed onto the text.
At ﬁrst glance. the documentation
looks very slick; a 120 page perfect
bound manual. The blurb claims that
you get a complete tutorial in how to
use the package but the reality is that
the book i s  little more than a
description of the various features with
very little rhyme or reason as far as
structure goes.
I showed the manual to two people,
one with no WP experience at all and
the other a  professional secretary.
Both complained that it was a total
hotch potch and very off putting.
This is one area which companies
could put a lot more effort into. A
package like this, which is presumably
aimed at the lower end of the market is
going to attract a lot of people who are
new to wordprocessing. The manual is
their life line and it would be of great
beneﬁt to  have something that i s
written i n  a  non-technical way,
preferably with an example document
or two and a series of exercises to work
through that introduce the different
facilities in a logical manner - a few at
a time.
Another necessity must surely be a
pull-out reference card detailingall the
various commands. N o t everybody
uses the menus and it is a pain to have
to keep trying to ﬁnd what you want in
the manual.
To sum up. TextPro is a simple to
use wordprocessor, suitable f o r
beginners b u t  marred b y  p o o r
documentation. Experienced users will
probably prefer something with a bit
more meat to it though and will ﬁnd
that it is not powerful enough for their
requirements.
Data Retrieve
Whereas TextPro was very simple to
use. Dataketrieve goes to the opposite
extreme. I  found i t  t o  b e  user
unfriendly throughout and never
really came to grips with it at all - a
combination of the program and the
R E V I E W S
documentation which is considerably
worse than the manual for TextPro.
The packaging starts o f f  b y
claiming how fast the program is. this
sounds impressive until you turn to
page three o f the manual where it
apologises for being so slow compared
to other programs. This is because
every record in your database is disk
based rather than memory based. This
has the advantage o f being a safer
method, but fast, it sure ain't.
The main feature that you have to
come t o  terms with when using
Dataketrieve is that of masking. The
mask is a template that you tailor to
your o w n  requirements. O n l y
information that appears in the 'slots'
that you have created is displayed
rather than the complete record. For
example, suppose you are running a
mail order business and want to print
off some address labels to send out
catalogues to your existing customers.
The only part o f  each customer's
record that you are interested in is their
name and address, so you mask off all
the details of past purchases, etc.
Your database can be password
protected for either user or operator.
User stops unauthorised access to
database while operator stops anyone
amending it.
Fields can be one of six types- text,
date, time. number. graphic or choice,
i.e. speciﬁc answers only. One thing I
particularly didn't like about setting
up choice ﬁelds was that when it came
to entering data, a typing error would
default to the last choice rather than
reprompting for a correct entry. For
example. suppose you wanted a choice
A. B or C. You set up your choice ﬁeld
to accept a/A/b/B/c/C. Now when
you are entering your data, you intend
to press the -
the -
The entry will actually read 'C' which
is not what you wanted and requires
you to check everything you enter very
carefully. A warning beep and a refusal
to move onto the next ﬁeld until a
correct key is pressed would be much
better.
Searching your database can be
decidedly tedious, especially if it is a
long one so you will need to set up an
index or multiple index e.g. sort by last
name, ﬁrst initial, second initial.
On screen establishment of records
and masks was confusing t o  the
extreme and not something that can be
tackled without considerable reference
to the manual which brings me nicely
YOUR AMIGA may 1988
30
to my h'ete noire th e  documentation.
Dubious Documentation
Horrendous was the ﬁrst word to
spring to mind. The manual was little
more than a description of what each
function was for, poorly structured
and highly technical. A  ﬁrst time
database user would stand very little
chance of coming to terms with this
package without considerable effort
on his or her part and not a little
technical knowledge.
It is not good enough to say here
are the tools, now go away and use
them. You have to be shown how to
use them. Up to eight databases can be
open at any given time. Fair enough
but why would anyone want to do it. A
few examples would not go amiss.
Sample records and masks for various
uses would be a great help. Again, why
is there no reference card of all the
various commands.
One example that highlights this
user unfriendliness especially can be
found o n  t h e  accompanying
packaging. "You can exchange data
with TextPro... t o  easily produce
mailing lists etc". This is one of the
commonest uses o f a database yet
scouring the indexes of both manuals
gave no clue as to where I might ﬁnd
information o n  h o w  t o  d o  this.
Scouring th e  manuals themselves
proved t o  b e  l i ttl e  better until
eventually. I found this reference. It
was in the glossary under 'form letter'
and the entry read; "Several text
editors allow you to  produce form
letters  I f  you've created an address
ﬁle using Dataketrieve. you can write
the ﬁle to disk so that you can see the
ﬁle for text editing." That is the sum
total of what you are told, The TextPro
manual has no entry for form letters
whatsoever. Still, at least I know that I
can do it. I just don't know howl
I found little in DataRetrieve to
recommend. People who have some
strange fetish about databases may
enjoy it but anyone who has bought
their Amiga expecting that all software
will be user friendly to the nth degree
should give this package a very wide
ro
berth indeed.

In the ﬁnal article of the series we look at the ﬁnal
pieces of code and summarise the package
I
exits a n d  objec t s ,  o p t i o n s
were provided t o  allow you t o
display text in a speciﬁc window. The
allows you to give information in a
clear manner  r ather  t h a n us e a
scrolling screen. The ﬁrst piece olcode
allows the easy manipulation of screen
windows. The code occupies the block
of memory from $C300 to SC55B and
has one entry point. The window
pos ition i s  s pec iﬁed b y  f o u r
parameters:
XC - the X or horizontal coordinate of
the top left corner of the window, It's
value can range from 0 to 38
YC - the Y or vertical coordinate of the
top left corner o f  the window. It's
value can range from 0 to 23
\VI - the width of the window (1 to 40)
In - the height of the window (Ito  25)
As usual, I have not included any
data veriﬁcation routines and y ou
should ensure t h a t  t h e  following
inequalities are fulﬁlled:
0 < = XC < ,--- 39
0 < = YC < = 24
XC + WI <  = 40
VC + H I  < =  25
The syntax of the commands is as
follows:
Scroll window up: SYS 49920,1 ,XC.
YC W I .H1
Both t h e  character arid c olour
information are scrolled up. The top
line o f  information is  lost and the
bottom line is ﬁlled with spaces.
Sc r oll w i n d o w  d o w n :  S Y S
49920,2,XC,YC,WI .F1 I
This is essentially the same as scroll
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G

up except, of course, for the direction
of action.
Invert screen: SYS 49920,3,XC,YC,
WI,HI
This ﬂips the top hit of each screen
code in the window. In the same way as
the cusor acts, calling the routine again
restores the screen contents.
Fill window: SYS 49920,4,XCACWI,
HI,CHAR,COLOUR
This ﬁlls  the window with the
speciﬁed character (POKE value) and
the speciﬁed colour.
Erase window: SYS 49920,5,XC,YC,
W LH]
This clears the window and sets it
to the current cursor colour.
With these live simple tools, you
can perform a wide range o f  useful
actions on the screen contents.
Up to now we have dealt with the
bare mechanics of the adventure such
as well deﬁned actions and movement.
If that were the sum total of the game,
things would be very boring indeed.
The things  w hic h h e l p  s et  t h e
atmosphere o f  a n  adventure a r e
random and semi-random events. In
BASIC there ar e several ways o f
generating such events:
You can use the random number
generator to initiate events. By using
the internal Need t o  create a  ﬁxed
sequence, a predictable series ofevents
can be used.
2. A  simple counter i n  the main
program loop can be used to generate
regular time independent events.
3. The internal clock can be used to
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
82
create time dependent events.
The drawback with the timer is that
there is only one. T o overcome this
limitation the second piece o f  code
provides •
even timers.
The system centres on an interrupt
driven routine which counts elapsed
time one second at a time. This timer is
linked to eight counters which are used

to verify whether an event has occured.
Before describing how  t o  use the
N% Stein. it will be useful ill tell you how
it works.
Each event timer has tour values,
each being in a table, These are:
I. A counter
2. A ﬂag. A zero value means that the
timer is off, a non zero value means
that the timer is active.
3. An interval 'value
4. A register.
Each time a second elapses, the
timer increments each counter, Each
event counter is checked in turn to
establish whether the event's interval
has elapsed. I f  the interval has not
elapsed, t h e  nex t ev ent t ime r  i s
checked. I f  the interval has elapsed.
one o f  three routines is  executed,
depending o n  t h e  ev ent t i m e r
concerned. These routines alter the
register related to the event timer and
may also zero the event's counter. You
then act according to the value in the
register.
Three types of timer are provided:
Count up -  each time the interval is
reached, the register is incremented by
one and the timer is zeroed. Event
timers D to 3 are of this type.
Count down - each time the interval is
reached, the register is decremented by
one and the timer is zeroed. Event
timers 4 and 5 are of this type,
Zeroing - when the interval is reached.
the register is zeroed. Since this is a one
shot timer, the timer is not zeroed.
Event timers 6 and 7 are of this type.
The code occupies the area $C600-
SC6DC. The event tables occupy the
following areas:
Timer table: SC700-$C707
Rag table: SC 7 0 8 - $ C 7 0 F
Interval table: 8C719-$C717
Register table: SC718-$C7IF
To access the tables, given a timer
T where T has a value from I to 8. use:
Timer Table:
5094+T
FLAG table:
50951+T
Interval table: 50953+T
Register table: 50967+T
Event timer 0 uses the ﬁrst va I Ile in
each table. timer I uses the second and
so on,
There are four entry points:
SYS 50688: This turns on the main
timer. This need usually be performed
once during the program, unless you
wish to access a disk drive.
SYS 50691: This turns off the main
timer. You should c all this  berme
using disk access.
SYS 50694, T I MER . IN T ER VAL:
This turns on the speciﬁed timer and
sets it's interval. (I to .255 seconds)
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G  E l
SYS 50697, TIMER: This turns off the
spec i lied timer.
 The count u p  and count down
registers allow you to count up to 255
intervals of 255 seconds. This gives a
range from a  second to roughly 18
hours, The zero timers give a range
from one to 255 seconds,
lere are three examples of how to
use the package:
• Imagine that y ou want a  magic
potion to last for 60 seconds and while
it is active, a ﬂag EL has a value alone.
The easy way to do this is with a single
shot "zero" timer. The following code
would do this:
SYS 50688: SYS 50694,6.60: PO KE
50974, I: FL= I
IF PEEK(50974)=0 T H EN  F L =0 :
SYS 50694,6
The ﬁrst tine starts the timer, sets
timer six to a 60 second interval and
starts it. sets the register for timer six to
one and sets F L .  The second line
checks the register for timer six to see if
60 seconds have elapsed. I f  the time
has elapsed, the timer is turned off and
FL set to zero.

strength to decrease by one every two
minutes and he dies when it reaches
zero. We use a decrementing timer:
If' y ou want t o  use y our  own
machine code or set up data tables. you
can use the following areas:
$88(10-88FTE (34816-36863)
SC800-SCA FE' (51100-51967)
Since the code encroaches into
memory usually used by BASIC. you
must remember to tweak the top of
memory poimer. You can do this by
using the following line at the start of
your program:
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
83
011111
SYS 50694.4.120: POKE 50972.ST :
IF P E E K  (50972)=0 T H EN  SYS
50697,4: PRINT"YOU ARE DEAD"
ST is  the starting strength of' the
character.
•  Imagine that y ou want day  and
night to occur and change every 60
minutes. A nag DAY is zero at night
and equal to I at day.
60 minutes = 3600 seconds
If we use an interval of 200 seconds,
this gives a maximum register value of
3600/100 or 18.
SYS 50694.0,100: P O K E  50968,0:
DAY= I
IF PEEK 50968=18 T H EN  PO KE
50968,0: D AY = ABS ( I+( DAY= I))
The ﬁrst line sets things going using
timer O. The second line checks to see if
3600 seconds have elapsed. If this time
has elapsed, the register is zeroed and
DAY toggled. Sin c e  t h i s  i s  a
continuing operation, the event timer
is left running.
That's all the code dealt with. It

C128 FKeys
Swapper
I
the function keys on the Cl28 to
carry out standard commands? I
used to have ﬁve or six short programs
that did just that. However when using
different ones I had to save whatever I
was working on and then load the key
program that I wanted and then reload
the original program, which can be
very tedious after a while.
Flipping through the chapter in the
Programmer's Reference Guide on the
Kernal routines I  noticed SFF65
PFKEY:program a  function key.
Having ﬁddled with Machine Code for
a while I decided to give it a go. The
registers used by the PFKEY routine
are: A.pointer t o  string address
(Io/hi/bank) f o r  which I  used
$ FA,S HI and SFc,SFA being stored in
the accumulator,Y.length of string to
be assigned to the key and X.the key
number (1 to I0),9 being the run stop
key and 10 the help key, The values for
X and Y I stored above the machine
code that does the swap— more on that
Later.
For those of you who don't want to
know the ins and outs of the program
just type i n  the basic loader and
DSAVE it before running it as it will
update itself if the checksum is correct.
It will also BSAVE a binary ﬁle called
FKEYS M/CODE to disk. If you use

the basic loader the help key is already
set up for swapping between the four

the minus will print F.
The Normal Keys are set up as

carry out an SYS 4864 to return the
deﬁnitions to the Disk keys.
To use the RUNDLOAD,BLOAD

up the directory and run the cursor up
to the ﬁle you want to load or scratch.
Press the key for the function you want
and the command string will be carried
out without having to shift the cursor
across to delete the ﬁle type. This
makes these one stroke commands.
If vou use the Basic loader always
reset the computer before loading and
running the program otherwise if you

created by the basic loader then start it
up with SYS 4864. You can load a
Machine Code ﬁle over the top of a
basic program without disturbing it as
long as they don't occupy the same
memory but the basic loader will
replace the basic program in memory.
The actual program sits in memory
from $1300 (4864) to $17A4 (6052).
The lengths of the strings are stored at
the following locations:
Disk Keys
- $16D5 to $16DE (5845 to 5854)
Keypad Keys
- $16DF to $16E8 (5855 to 5864)
Hexpad Keys
- $16E9 to $16F2 (5865 to 5874)
Normal Keys
- $16F3 to $16FC (5875 to 5884)
The FKey Strings are stored from:
Deﬁnitions -
$16FD to $17,A4 (5885 to 6052)
On my disk the basic DATA took
up 23 blocks and the FKeys M/code
took tip ﬁve blocks.
If you d o  change any o f  the
deﬁnitions to suit yourself, remember
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
85
to change the string length and the
Io/high/bank that are stored in zero
page. When the Keypad and Hexpad
routine change the keys the characters
are stored fron SIBOO (6912) to $1B58
(7000) so don't use this area.
One point to remember is because I
use 80 columns most of the time, at the
start o f  each swap routine th e
computer is put into FAST and at the
end is put into SLOW. On the 40
column screen it causes the screen to
ﬂash quickly, however I don't think
this will bother anyone unduly. If it
does then type in the following lines:
125 REM **REPLACE 255 with 252
TO CANCEL FAST**

entering one of the superb programs from Your Conunodore.
Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R,
U and N. You press RETURN, sit back and nothing happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how long
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of 0.00 for disk and i:4.00 for cassette. None of the

Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working

can call up any keyword and see a
description o f  the command and an
example of its syntax.
The C128 Helpc r is a clever utility
which uses specially created disk ﬁles
to instantly display information on the
screen using a small resident program.
The usefulness of the program can also
grow as  y our  knowledge expands
through a special editing program.
Each page of information is stored
as a separate ﬁle on the disk and the
ingenious operating system allows
about 166 ﬁles to be held on each
Helper disk. This exceeds the stated
maximum disk capacity o f  144 ﬁles
and this is one good reason why a
Helper disk should never be validated.
Owners o f  double-sided disk drives
will have access to twice as many ﬁles,
which means that all o f  the Basic
commands could be stored as well as
almost 200 extra pages of information
on peeks a n d  pokes, o r  even a
complete memory map!

particularly impressive because i t
allows a fully comprehensive screen
editing facility.
Wrhen designing a  screen i t  is
important that the screen does not
scroll up as you type information into
the last line. The editor does this for
you and y ou can move the cursor
around t h e  s c reen a d d in g  a n d
subtracting information as y ou g o
ignoring colour information until last.
When colour needs to be added.
the Editor has a  special command
which allows you to pull the cursor
across letters after selecting a colour.
Each character that the cursor covers
will be changed to the current colour.
When the screen is designed, the
program will then save it to disk using
a compressing routine s o that the
minimum disk space is  used. This
typically compresses about 16 blocks
of screen information into a mere four
blocks.
From inside Helper any screen can
be dumped to a printer or plotter by
pressing the Commodore key and in
normal pr ogr amming m o d e  t h is
facility is still available using SHIFT
with RUN/STOP.

The program obviously uses some
of the C128's memory but, as the
excellent documentation shows, these
locations d o n ' t  affec t t h e  Bas ic
programming space too much. Even
when accessing the Helper, the screen
display at entry is stored away and on
return t o Basic programming mode
the screen is restored intact.
Helper makes full use of all of the
function keys and the AL T  key can
also be used to 'boot' up a new Helper
disk and its menu. This means that a
full library of disks can be created to
allow i n s t a n t  ac c es s  t o  a n y
information which may be relevant to
your pr ogr amming needs. E v e n
though the H EL P key is  used f or
calling up Helper, the resident HELP
command is still accessible by typing
in the keyword in direct mode,
The applications for  Helper are
only limited by your own imagination.
Used in conjunction with your own
program. you could use Helper as a
help facility within a utility of your
own s uc h a s  a  w o r d  processor,
database o r  game. W i t h  c areful
planning even machine code programs
can access Helper because o f  the
detailed information on the memory
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988

locations accessed b y  t h e  master
program which are given in the small
accompanying manual.
For the programmer, C128 Helper
is a signiﬁcant improvement on book
assisted programming. On its own the
basic information given with I lelper is
worth a  king's ransom, adding the
editing fac ilities  mak es  t h is  a n
essential time saver utility.
Every angle seems to be covered.
The C12.8 is  disturbed as little as
possible from its normal operational
mode and some o f  the information
given, answers questions which keep
cropping up in letters to the editor. For
example. not many people know this
but the keyboard buffer lies between
locations 842 and 851. I  haven't seen
this documented anywhere else, s o

Screendraw 64
W
dore it is common to draw
each screen, and t o  use
sprites a n d  mo re  user-deﬁned
characters for the objects that move.
Screendraw i s  a  machine-code
program to assist with the design of
such screens. There are already a few
programs around to do this, but I for
one, have found them cumbersome to
use as they often involve selecting one
screen o p ti o n  f o r  designing a
character, then going to a page display
to insert th a t character into the
picture. then i f it doesn't quite look
right going back to the character edit
screen where yo u  can't see th e
character in context, and so on. With
this in mind I have written a screen
designer which is extremely simple and
quick to use, and most importantly
displays everything on the same screen
at the same time. A joystick in Port 2
does the bulk of the work, assisted by a
few easy to remember keypresses. SYS
49152 runs the program. The screen
then shows the following:
The program works with a picture
256 characters across by 64 characters
down. This is to enable any size of
screen to be drawn and because of the
simple way such a picture is stored in
memory it is easy to extract completed
screens for use in your own programs
(refered to later). The top section of the
screen displays a 40X 16 window of this
page - when you move off the screen
with the joystick the window scrolls.
The bottom left sectioki o f  the
screen shows the full character set
available to be used and edited, in full
colour. Th e  program allows h i -
resolution 2-colour a n d  lower-
G ETTING  I N T O  G R APH IC S
resolution 4-colour characters
(multicolour), and lets you assign a
particular unique colour fo r each
character which is remembered in a
table. This seems to  be the most
efﬁcient and easy-to-use method o f
deﬁning a l l  th e  colours f o r  a
multicoloured screen.
The bottom right corner o f the
screen shows a n  8X8 grid which
displays the exact pixel representation
of the current character, and is also
used to edit the characters.
Below the picture window is a line
containing useful information, the
current location in memory o f the
picture window (in hex), the four
colours relevant t o  th e  current
characters (in hex), and the number of
the current character (decimal 0-255).
This area is also used for entering
ﬁlenames and telling you what is going
on w h e n  d i s k  operations a r e
happening.
On the screen, there are three
modes o f operation, depending on
which part of the screen your joystick-
controlled cursor i s  i n , Moving
between th e  screen windows i s
performed by the keys SPACE for the
picture, E for editing a character and P
for selecting a  character from the
palette (i.e. character set).
Picture Mode -  the FIRE button
draws the current character (displayed
on the bottom-right grid) onto the
picture. The following keys have the
following.
P -  Move to  Palette to  select a
character, see PALETTE MODE >
B -  Get character under cursor and
make it the current character (so you
don't have to go to the palette to get a
previously-used character).
D Duplicate character under cursor
onto current edit character. After
selecting a character with P or G, if it is
to be similar to another character, use
D to set its pixels and colours to that of
the old character. and then use E to
edit it.
E -  Moves you to character EDIT
MODE (see below). STOP ends the
program.

A powerful background and character editor
By Paul Williams
I - Takes a 40X25 image of the picture
using the cursor position as the top left
corner of the image and puts it away in
a I K block of memory at 15360-16359,
for use i n  yo u r o w n  programs.
Alternatively you can read the picture
memory block directly with your own
BASIC o r  machine-code programs
(see later).
CLR Clears everything, and copies the
ROM character set into your character
space.
CURSOR Inserts a space in the current
line and shifts all
RIGHT Further right characters up
one.
CURSOR Deletes the character under
the cursor and shufﬂes.
LEFT all the rest down.
L Load character set from disk.
SHFT-L Load picture from disk.
SHFT-S Save picture to disk.
SHFT-I Mark this position as the top
left corner of a block to be copied.
SFIFT-2 Mark this position as the
bottom right corner of a block to be
moved.
SHFT-3 Copy the screen block deﬁned
by SHIFT-1 and SHIFT-2 to where
the cursor currently is.
PALLETE MODE -  you use the
joystick to position the cursor over the
character you want, then FIRE to
select that as the current character and
move you back to PICTURE MODE.
CHARACTER ED IT MODE -  the
ﬁre button is used to draw and erase
pikels in the character being edited.
The 8k8 pikd grid shows an exact
enlarged version of the character, and
when i n  multicolour mode th e
colours here also reﬂect the colours of
the character, even though every pair
of bits is then used to  deﬁne one
coloured pikel in the character (this
follows th e  usual convention o f
Commodore 6 4  multi-coloured
characters).

C16 & Plus/4
Software Offer
Do you wish that more C16 and Plus/4 programs were
available on disk or cassette? Well here's our third C16
and Plus/4 software collection
D
complexity of the programs that are
published in Your Commodore, many
people ﬁnd that once they have typed
them in they do not work. Usually,
this is not the fault of the magazine,
but rather, due to the program, being
typed incorrectly.
To help readers we do provide a
Software for Sale service that makes
all of the programs from each month's
magazine available on disk or tape.
Due to the small number of programs
that we publish for the C16 and Plus/
4 we only place the software for those
machines on the disk with all of the
other software from the issues.
In this issue we are pleased to
announce the launch of our third CI6
and Plus/4 four collection containing
no fewer than eight programs from
past issues of Your Commodore,
All of the programs that are on the
tape or disk are from recent issues of
the magazine, however, instructions
are included with the programs in case
you missed any of the magazines.
What Do You Get?
So just what is on the latest Software
cassette or Disk and which machines
do they work on?
On both cassette and disk you will
ﬁnd the following:
READERS SERVICE
•
o.
CI6 SPRITES -  taken from our
August 1987 edition, this program
gives C16 and Plus/ 4 owners access
to sprites, just like those to be found
on the CM. A demonstration program
is also included to show just what is
possible.
+4 A N IM A TOR  —  a  simple
demonstration program showing how
you can store a series of pictures in
memory to give the appearance of
animation (Plus/4 and Expanded C16
only.)
REBOUND - an excellent version of
the latest breakout type games.
DISK MENUS- ﬁnd and load your
programs with ease using this
program. Obviously this requires a
disk drive.
TYPRO -  our extremely popular
'typewriter' program from December
1987. Turn you Plus/4 computer and
printer into a  powerful electronic
typewriter.
Plus/4 Assembler -  an excellent
machine code assembler program for
Plus" 4 owners.
TRANSCRIPT - owners of the Script
Plus Cartridge can now convert their
Plus 3 t e x t  ﬁles to work with this
wordprocessor.
PLUS/4 EXTENDED BASIC - Add
almost 40 new commands to the Basic
on you Plus/4, or C16 with memory
expansion. Ir  -,luding commands for
accessing the disk drive, drawing
graphics etc. as well as a whole range
of new Basic functions.
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988

C16's and Memory Expansion
The C16 and Plus/4 computers are
almost identical, except for the fact
that the C16 has far less memory than
its big brother the Plus/ 4. This
compatibility means that programs for
one of these computers will work on
the other, as long as enough memory
is available. The exception to this being
programs that access the in-built
software of the Plus/4, for example,
the TRANSCRIPT program on this
disk or tape.
A number of companies produce
memory expansion cartridges for the
CI6 and expand its memory to varying
degrees. If  you have expanded your
CI6's memory to 64K then all of the
programs, except TRANSCRIPT will
work on your machine.
How Much Is The Software?
The price of the software is E5.00 for
cassette and 0.00for disk,this includes
instructions. Orders should be sent to
the address on the order for Readers
Services, they should NOT be sent to
the editorial address.
Orders should be accompanied by
a cheque or postal order for the correct
amount made payable t o Argus
Specialist Publications.
We welcome orders from overseas
readers. However we do have to add
a further E.1.00 in order to cover the
increased postage charges.

ou may  have noticed that our
'stings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for  a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f  countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding s y s tem. T h e  c o d e ,  o r
mnemonic, is  always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, I SA'  would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA 10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S+21 means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C+2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
f more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPCA] o r ,  exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N .  DO WNILEF T 5.BLUE.

This would be achieved by holding

down the CTRL key as you press N.
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F 3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SSI,[C]
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T1 will
appear in a  listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press t h e  number  n in e
(RVSON). type the relevant number o
reversed T 's  and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (  RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one of  these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE may 1988
98
:CC---211
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

The screen will turn brown with yellow

corresponding value in the magazine.

Bug Finder
We'd like to remind our readers that
we run a Bug Finder service.
If you have typed in one of our
programs and despite much checking.
you still can't get it to run, then send us
the following:
Two copies of your program on tape
or disk.
A description of your problem.
If possible a listing of your work (you
may omit this).
A stamped. self-addressed envelope
for return of' the program to you.
Should any of the above be missing
then we will not be able to deal with
your query.
We will try to point out where you
have made errors and place a corrected
copy of the program back on to your
tape or disk before we return it to you.
Do not send a program to us as
soon as it stops working, please check
it several times ﬁrst.
Vyre d o  get a  large number o f
queries and so it may take a while for
us to deal with yours personally.
Note: we can only deal with problems
relating to programs published in Your
Commodore_

Commodore Where Are You?
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we are
repeatedly asked for the address and

their computer manuals, believe them
to be based in Corby.
The Commodore plant at Corby
was closed down some time ago.
Reproduced here y ou w ill ﬁnd the
correct address for Commodore U.K.
We suggest that y ou write this
correct address in the front of  your

The Switchback,
Gardner Road,

At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we receive hundreds of letters from readers every
month. We do try and answer each individually but sometimes this is impossible
due to pressure of work. If you have written to us and not received a personal
reply, we apologise for this but we cannot promise to reply to every item of mail
we receive. If you feel that your question or letter really needs an answer, then
inclusion of an s.a.e. will guarantee a reply, although this may still take time to
arrive.

These programs have sold thousands of
copies, and yet you won't have seen them
in the charts — why?
We produce programs that you can really
get y o u r  te e th  in t o .  P ro g ra ms lik e
BUSICALC a n d  B US ICA L C 3  wh ich
can be used at home or in the ofﬁce to do
all sorts of calculations, forecasts and
budgets.
Programs like MIKRO ASSEMBLER and
the ZOOM monitor which make it easy to
write machine code programs. Programs
like MUS IC MASTER which turn yo u r
computer into a musical instrument. And
programs like the BLITZ compiler which
makes ordinary BASIC programs ru n
much, much faster_
We have b e e n writin g  programs f o r
Commodore computers since 1978 and
now have hundreds of programs for the
PET, VIC 20, CBM 64, CBM 128, even the
C16 a n d  Plus/4. S o  w h y  aren't o u r
programs in the charts?
Because our programs aren't one minute
wonders, here today and gone tomorrow.
Programs we released for the 64 in 1983
are still selling — and even more impor-
tant, the people who bought them then
are still using them.
Software should be an investment, not
money down the drain. We believe that
the more you put into a program, the
more you should get out of it, and that's
the wa y it  wo rks with  software f ro m
SUPERSOFT.
The programs listed on the right represent
