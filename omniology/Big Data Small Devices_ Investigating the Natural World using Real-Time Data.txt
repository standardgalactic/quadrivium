ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
D
onna would like to acknowledge Dr. Tim Slater for introducing her to the world 
of real-time data when the internet was still new. Dr. Slater has been an important 
mentor to Donna over the years and given her multiple opportunities to grow and 
develop as an education professional.
Mike’s interest in real-world “messy” data and how that could be represented in com-
plex graphs heightened during his MSc(Res) with encouragement from his supervisor, 
John Sprague. During his work as a middle school science teacher, his eighth-grade stu-
dents inspired him further in this area, and his PhD supervisor, Wolff-Michael Roth, was a 
wonderful mentor and supported his later research and writing about graphing, data table 
use, and other data literacy areas.
Eric would like to acknowledge David Braunschweig for showing him the power of 
having students use data to create and revise models of scientific phenomena. Eric was 
a student teacher with David in his Madison, Wisconsin, physics classroom 20 years ago.

PREFACE
I
n the HBO (Home Box Office) series From the Earth to the Moon, there is a dramatization 
of the field geology training that was provided to the Apollo astronauts assigned to 
the final three missions. Geologist Lee Silver (played by David Clennon) offered an 
analogy about “context.” He said, “If you brought me a dead cat, I can tell you two things 
about it: It was a cat, and it is dead. If you told me you found it in the middle of the road …
what killed the cat? What if you found it in the kitchen of your favorite restaurant?” He 
was referring to context as the difference between road kill and a meal.
And what does access to large data sets provide to students? It provides a number of 
supports for learning—most importantly, context. As has been frequently cited in science 
education reform documents, science learning has often been approached in a manner 
that has been very broad at the expense of depth. Coverage, it seems, can be the enemy of 
understanding (Gardner 1991). Context can provide the necessary depth for understanding 
by making explicit the connections between the science content that we wish for students 
to learn and the real world. The real world is complex and defies simple understandings—
or rather, simple understandings are inadequate for grasping the complex, multivariate 
patterns that are inherent to the natural world.
This volume embraces the fact that the natural world is complex and multivariate, but 
through the three-dimensional learning structure of A Framework for K–12 Science Education 
(Framework; NRC 2012), this complexity is not necessarily complicated. Complex systems 
operate on a variety of scales and evolve over time with the amount of energy present in 
the system (Fichter, Pyle, and Whitmeyer 2010). Understanding systems, a fundamental 
part of the crosscutting concepts, does not mean that a deterministic outcome is avail-
able. Rather, recognizable patterns can be displayed by comparing data related to natural 
Earth phenomena, whether they are the mapped distribution of earthquake epicenters or 
the variations in temperature and humidity with altitude across locations. The more data 
that are available, the more robust are the inferences that can be made regarding complex 
relationships, and the clearer is the pattern that can emerge. By analyzing changes in the 
patterns, other crosscutting concepts can be accessed, such as stability and change; cause 
and effect: mechanism and explanation; and scale, proportion, and quantity.
The other critical aspect of the Framework that goes beyond the disciplinary core ideas 
is the practices employed by scientists and engineers as they go about their work. This 
volume is well-positioned to use the science and engineering practices to provide context

as well. As was illustrated in the now infamous “climategate” email hacking incident 
(Cook 2016), the public has a different understanding of “data manipulation” than scien-
tists employ. To properly analyze and interpret data, particularly large data sets, scientists 
have to organize the data in a manner that makes sense for generating and testing models, 
as well as for generating arguments from these data. A connective practice is the use of 
mathematical and computational thinking, which not only provides context to scientific 
thinking, but also provides a platform for teachers of mathematics and science to reconcile 
language and terminology differences that cause students to have endless frustration.
Context for large data sets thus is critical not only to scientific understanding, but also 
to learning how to understand the natural world from a scientific standpoint. Fundamen-
tally woven in the performance expectations within the Next Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS; NGSS Lead States 2013), context is the basis by which we can distinguish ourselves 
from the automated devices we use to collect such data and evaluate whether or not the 
data are accurate, valuable, and sufficient. I trust you will find this volume useful not just 
in teaching science, but also in using science as a way to grasp the complexity of the natural 
world with awe and wonder, instead of fear.

INTRODUCTION
S
martphones and tablets are now in the hands of even our youngest learners. As 
teachers, we are encouraged to use bring-your-own-technology (BYOT), but often 
are not sure how to transform smartphones and tablets into a valuable learning tool 
for meaningful instruction.
One answer lies in using a number of free smartphone and tablet apps that provide 
“real-time” data to explore Earth and environmental science concepts. These are data col-
lected and made available in real time, or nearly so. Real-time data can be found on web-
sites such as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), NASA, and 
the National Weather Service (NWS). These are all government agencies that provide 
free data products such as weather and earthquake information, streamflow data, toxic 
waste information, times of celestial events, and planetary data. These data are free, and 
a multitude of apps have been developed that access and visualize them, in most cases 
at no cost. Students can access this information on websites; however, allowing students 
to investigate concepts using their smartphones in app-based activities allows them to be 
more engaged in science investigations and teaches them how to turn the technology they 
carry with them all the time into a useful learning tool.
Using real data in classroom investigations aligns with the following Next Generation 
Science Standards (NGSS) science and engineering practices:
•	
Asking questions and defining problems
•	
Planning and carrying out investigations
•	
Analyzing and interpreting data
•	
Developing and using models
•	
Constructing explanations and designing solutions
•	
Engaging in argument from evidence
•	
Using mathematics and computational thinking
•

The NGSS crosscutting concepts involved in real-time data investigations include the 
following:
•	
Patterns
•	
Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation
•	
Scale, proportion, and quantity
•	
Systems and system models
•	
Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation
•	
Structure and function
•	
Stability and change
This book is designed to help the classroom Earth and environmental science teacher 
develop student investigations that use real-time data. It includes information on the tech-
nology and classroom implementation aspects of accessing and using data for meaningful 
learning. Sample lesson plans are included that showcase specific data and the apps that 
include them. But more importantly, this book provides the classroom teacher with a set of 
tools to develop investigations with any online-accessible data. Finally, exploring real-time 
data is not limited to independent experiences—collecting and sharing data with others 
can promote collaborative scientific investigations. With the use of multiple web-based 
applications and apps for personal devices, opportunities exist for everyone to participate 
in citizen science programs.

WHAT ARE REAL-TIME DATA?
E
very time an earthquake happens anywhere on our planet, the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey (USGS) records its location, magnitude, and depth. This information is avail-
able immediately through the USGS website. Most people are familiar with the data 
provided by the National Weather Service. Through its website, information about surface 
and atmospheric conditions such as barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, and 
humidity are updated hourly and available in real time.
The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), a division of the National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration (NOAA), provides data from hundreds of buoys in every ocean 
and other major body of water in the world (Figure 1.1), including latitude, longitude, 
wind speed, wave height, air temperature, water temperature, and wave period. These 
data are updated hourly for most stations and posted online in real time. As conditions 
change, data are updated and made immediately accessible to anyone, anywhere.
Other data collected by various government agencies and distributed via the web in 
real time include stream quality, groundwater levels, toxic waste amounts, ozone levels, 
tide tables, Moon phase, and sunrise and sunset times. Because these data are provided by

various government agencies, they are free of cost and available for use by any individual 
or organization. Their availability is a public service that is widely used by scientists all 
over the world.
These real-time data provide a record of the heartbeat and pulse of our planet and are 
a rich source of information, perfect for student investigations into how Earth’s systems 
work. Data accessed in real time helps students connect the events in their lives to the 
world of science. Data sets can be fully explored by anyone with access for investigating 
patterns and relationships. Long-term trends can be analyzed using data collected over 
time. Alternatively, data from multiple sources can be compared to identify variables that 
interact and affect each other.
ACCESSING REAL-TIME DATA FOR STUDENT 
INVESTIGATIONS
Through a series of fortunate events, Donna was asked in 1995 to be a part of team to 
develop an internet-based curriculum with real-time data using a new technology inter-
face called the internet. Web browsers were relatively new at that time, replacing propri-
etary services such as Prodigy, Compuserve, and America Online (AOL). Online modems 
had advanced to what seemed like incredible speeds and a brand new world of informa-
tion was at our fingertips. She was thrilled to be asked to participate in this project and 
upgraded to an Apple Macintosh 500 series computer. With 5 megabytes (MB) of memory, 
100 MB of hard drive space, and a processing speed of 33 MHz, it connected at lightning 
speeds of 56 kbit/s with a brand new modem.
This new type of technology interface was amazing and opened up a world of informa-
tion with instant access. Not only could teachers communicate in real-time, but they also 
could also access data collected by scientists from all over the world. The uniqueness of 
the internet as a teaching tool was not in any single feature, but rather in its richness and 
diversity of resources and capabilities. Text, graphics, audio, video, animations, commu-
nications, and interactivity were all included in the web environment. For the first time, 
teachers could bring real-world problems and investigations into their classrooms. Time 
and place no longer limited educational opportunities, and Donna was pleased to be a 
participant in these early online communities.
One of the first real-time data investigations Donna did with her students involved 
tracking earthquake activity for a 30-day period. At the time, she was teaching a multi-age 
class of fourth and fifth graders using an interdisciplinary approach. Each morning, she 
would have a different pair of students connect to the USGS website and find out where 
earthquakes had occurred during the previous 24 hours. As a class, the students would 
use latitude and longitude to find the earthquakes’ epicenters on a large map on a bulletin 
board, and then mark those locations with pushpins that were color-coded by magnitude.

By the end of the month, students could clearly see the outline of the major tectonic plates 
and where the higher-magnitude earthquakes occurred. Donna’s students read about 
earthquakes, both fiction and non-fiction. Over the course of the unit, she watched her 
students engage in an integrated and authentic learning experience using real-time data. 
And she was hooked. The internet and the rich sources of data that could be accessed 
online had the potential to change the way science was taught.
Similarly, Eric used online archived weather data with middle school students to 
develop an understanding of climate. Students used data from a fifteen-year period  
to identify temperature and rainfall patterns in multiple cities. They used these patterns to 
predict future weather and to identify different climate zones in the United States.
Over the past 20 years, technology has taken us on a wild ride. What seemed like light-
ning speed in 1995 would frustrate an online community user beyond belief today. The 
amount of data available has increased exponentially. Real-time investigations have con-
tinued to be a part of teaching science; however, two major changes have occurred that 
have advanced how we present and use real-time data. One is in data’s accessibility; the 
other is in the users themselves.
Smartphones and tablets are relatively new technologies are changing the way we live 
and interact with the world. Not only are we connected for voice, but we also have a world 
of data at our fingertips wherever we are. Also, although not every student has a personal 
technology device, it is becoming more common than not for students to walk into our 
classrooms internet-connected via one (usually plugged in through earbuds). A few years 
ago, whatever data Donna and Eric wanted to use for student investigations could be 
accessed in real-time, but because there were few computers and limited connectivity in 
the classroom, it was difficult to manage. Teachers had to either project the data that they 
wanted students to interact with on a whiteboard or screen or provide paper copies of 
them. Now, enough students have smartphones that a teacher need only provide students 
with a uniform resource locator (URL) or a device app, and they can gather their own data 
individually or in small groups.
Not only has the internet revolutionized how we teach, but smartphones have revo-
lutionized how we access and use the internet. These devices are windows to a world of 
data that are reported in real time and ready for student investigation. Research done as 
early as 2001 with Palm-based handheld devices showed that “handheld-based probes 
augmented inquiry-based investigations with real-time data and visualizations, which in 
turn increased the students’ engagement and let them concentrate on science rather than 
logistics” (Tatar et al. 2003, p. 31).
The second major change that has affected how we teach is in the nature of the stu-
dents. Students, as well as an ever-increasing population of teachers, are part of the digital 
generation. Born after 1990, digital natives have grown up with technology substantially 
influencing every aspect of their lives. They are so dependent on their smartphones that

it often is difficult for teachers to separate them from their devices during instruction! But 
today’s students use technology not just to chat and socialize, but also to solve everyday 
problems. Our students use their devices to take pictures of homework assignments on 
the whiteboard, set reminders for assignments in their calendars, and set up virtual study 
groups for tests. Today’s students see technology as an integral part of their world and find 
technology solutions for almost every need. The use of smartphones and tablets to access 
real-time data might not be something today’s students would do on their own, but would 
be an application that they might expect. For teachers, finding and accessing the right data 
and determining the best approach to using them are often challenging.
Data are provided by federal agencies such as NASA, USGS, NOAA, and the Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA). Other data are collected and shared online by univer-
sities and private organizations; some sites are funded by National Science Foundation 
(NSF) grants, and others, by nonprofit organizations. Regardless of the source, there is an 
abundance of real-time data out there.
Our focus for this book is on using real-time data for Earth and environmental science. 
We have organized and presented such resources by sphere in chapters five through nine. 
The atmosphere chapter includes information related to the weather, climate, air pollution, 
and more. The world of living organisms and how they interact with their environment are 
part of the biosphere chapter. Data on earthquakes, landfills, and soils are grouped in the 
geosphere chapter. The hydrosphere chapter covers ocean currents, sea-surface temperature, 
streamflow, water pollution, and water quality. Glaciers, snow pack and ice caps are part 
of the cryosphere, but for purposes of this book are in the hydrosphere chapter. Finally, we 
cover phenomena such as seasonal changes and phases of the Moon in the chapter on the 
celestial sphere.
USING CROSSCUTTING CONCEPTS WITH REAL-
TIME DATA
Regardless of its source, how scientists use data is reasonably consistent across all disci-
plines. Common themes, or crosscutting concepts, are basic to developing student under-
standing of the work scientists do. These themes provide “an organization framework for 
connecting knowledge” (NRC 2012). When real-time data are used in classroom investiga-
tions, students build on these fundamental concepts. The crosscutting concepts facilitated 
by the use of real-time data include the following:
•	
Patterns
•	
Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation
•	
Scale, proportion, and quantity

Systems and system models

Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation
•	
Structure and function

Stability and change
In addition to providing an organizing framework for scientific knowledge, the cross-
cutting concepts defined in the NGSS provide a lens through which scientists (and our 
students) can view new scientific phenomena. Describing a system being observed, iden-
tifying patterns, and looking for changes in data are good starting points for making sense 
of the world around us. In the classroom, it is often easier to organize crosscutting concepts 
into four of those categories that are closely related: Patterns, Cause and Effect, Systems 
and System Models, and Stability and Change. When analyzing phenomena, encourage 
your students to start by asking the questions in Table 1.1. The remainder of this chapter 
provides examples of some of these crosscutting concepts in use.

Patterns
Patterns are evident in the world around us and are often recognizable in the data scientists 
collect. Scientists identify patterns to build explanations for how the world works and to pre-
dict events. Patterns that are evident in data can inspire questions that build an understand-
ing of natural phenomena. Explanations can arise from the correspondences in the patterns, 
but also sometimes from the variations in the patterns or even the absence of a pattern.
For example, consider the data shown in Table 1.2, which were collected by the National 
Weather Service on May 10–11, 2015, and accessed in real time. Although we could have pulled 
data for many different variables, we chose to concentrate on wind speed, wind direction, and 
air pressure. In addition, Figure 1.2 shows how winds 
circulate around low-pressure systems. What patterns 
are evident in the data? Is the pressure increasing or 
decreasing? What about the wind speed? The air pres-
sure? Are there any apparent correlations?
Correlating wind speed and air pressure does not 
seem to show an identifiable pattern. Over time, air 
pressure falls and then begins to rise again. When 
you look carefully at the data, the one pattern that 
emerges is the relationship between air pressure and 
wind direction. Right before air pressure reaches 
its lowest point, the winds are from the southeast. 
When the weather system has passed and the air 
pressure has begun to rise, the winds shift and are 
from the west. By identifying this simple pattern, 
students can build an explanation for how weather 
systems work. To build an understanding of natural phenomena, data can be collected 
from multiple events in real time to see whether this pattern is consistent and repeatable. 
Cause and Effect: Mechanism and Explanation
Questions can be used to guide students in establishing causal relationships as they work 
with patterns. In exploring and mapping earthquake data from a period of time, students 
easily see that whereas earthquakes can happen anywhere, they often occur in the Pacific 
Ocean in what is referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire (Figure 1.3). This tectonic ring is located 
along tectonic plate boundaries where the Pacific Plate is subducting under other plates.
As students explore earthquake patterns using real-time data, they can see that there 
is a cause-and-effect relationship between earthquakes and plate boundaries. They can 
identify the forces at work and the hazards associated with plate boundaries, and can use 
this relationship to help understand natural events in the world and the evidence scientists 
use in developing theories.

Systems and System Models
The best way for students to explore Earth and environmental science is through a systems 
approach. In science, systems are related factors that interact to form a single unit. In Earth 
and environmental science, these are usually categorized as the geosphere, atmosphere, 
hydrosphere, and biosphere. These systems are bounded by physical criteria and forces, 
but they interact and affect each other in complex ways. Exploring real-time data can help 
students build conceptual models to form an understanding of the interactions within and 
among systems. Graphs are often helpful in visualizing data and useful for students for 
constructing models.
The NDBC data in Table 1.3 are a good example of how real-time data can be used to 
help students build conceptual models to better understand systems and their interac-
tions. Surface waves in the ocean are caused by wind, with speed, duration, and fetch 
(distance) all affecting wave height. The data show a correlation between wind speed and 
wave height (Figure 1.4). Interactions between the atmosphere and the hydrosphere are 
evident, as students conclude that, in general, the greater the wind speed, the higher the 
waves; however, it is clear from the outliers present that something other than wind speed 
is affecting wave height. Wind duration and fetch are not in the available data, but provide 
a good explanation for the outlying data.
When the data are appropriate for scatterplot analysis, a trend line can show a mathe-
matical correlation between variables. This serves as a mathematical model that is valuable 
for predicting how a system will respond to future interactions. In the example discussed 
above, the slope is 0.39 with a correlation coefficient of 87% (indicating that most of the 
values are very close to the line of best fit and that it is a strong correlation). Using real-time 
data to investigate components of any system will help students build conceptual models 
and develop a greater understanding of the science.
Stability and Change
Understanding stability and change in Earth’s systems and the environment is important 
for understanding how nature works. Systems are stable in that the flows of energy and 
matter are steady and predictable. Although they are not considered static, Earth’s sys-
tems are in dynamic equilibrium and its patterns vary in rhythmic and cyclic ways. Tides 
rise and fall with the phases of the Moon, increased precipitation affects streamflow, and 
increased altitude at a given latitude results in decreased temperatures. Over time these 
patterns seem unchanging; however, they can be destabilized when balances in matter 
and energy within a system are disrupted. Real-time data are useful in helping students 
to identify natural cycles and explore forces of change within and across Earth’s systems.
An example of data comes from exploring high and low temperatures on a given date. 
During the 45-year period from 1970 to 2015, the mean (average) high temperature on

May 11 in Atlanta, Georgia, was 80°F and the mean low was 57°F. Table 1.4 shows the high 
and low temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit, measured biennially on this date from 1984 to 
2014. Data for the 1984–2014 period show a relatively stable pattern, with a narrow range 
of temperatures such as can be expected on a spring day in the southeastern United States, 
based on the data for the period (Figure 1.5).
Looking at variations from real-time data can help students understand how differ-
ent factors can create change. On May 11, 2015, this station recorded a high temperature 
of 90°F and a low of 66°F. Although well above the normal high and low for that date, 
these temperatures are within a range of conditions under which scientists would expect to 
find in a stable system. Questions that arise from such an investigation will help students 
understand not only the system, but also the conditions that might bring about change.

SUMMARY
Using real-time data is one of the best ways to get students to explore the natural world. 
The data inherently allow students to better understand the themes of doing science as 
they participate in meaningful investigations. Events they observe happening in the world 
around them can be quantified and explored by identifying patterns, hypothesizing about 
cause and effect, developing models of system dynamics, and identifying indicators of 
stability and change. Unlike earlier generations of students, students today have a world 
of big data available to them at any given moment on small devices they carry with them 
at all times. The data are limitless, relevant to their daily lives, current, and accessible in 
real time. Now, let’s find out how to access that world of data!

TECHNOLOGY TIPS AND TRICKS
T
here are many options for accessing real-time data. Desktops, laptops, tablets, and 
smartphones can all be used to access the data your students need to participate in 
real-time data investigations. Some students will be on Windows-based computers 
and Android devices; others will be on iPhones or iPads or using a Mac operating system. 
For the teacher who wants students to access data, it helps to know a little about these dif-
ferent options and how to navigate some of the issues students will encounter as they turn 
their devices into tools to conduct their investigations. In this chapter, we will look at some 
of the basics you need to know to access and use technology for retrieving and processing 
data in student investigations.
ACCESSING YOUR SCHOOL’S NETWORK
The most important consideration in using internet-based data is how to access it; school 
district technology departments have rules and regulations governing how technology 
may be accessed and used. Most school districts have policies in place that maximize 
access to internet-based resources but also protect students from inappropriate content. 
The guidelines for school districts set by the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) are 
incorporated into each district’s Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs). Such policies incorporate 
a variety of tools and rules to help keep students from accessing material that is inappro-
priate or potentially harmful. Filters, monitors, and blocking software are the most com-
mon way for districts to comply with CIPA, but the implementation of CIPA is different 
in every school system (Bosco 2013). Some systems block all videos, chat functions, and 
social networking sites, some search engines, and some website domain extensions (for 
example, they may allow access to .edu and .gov websites but not to .net or .biz sites). 
Many systems also log student use of different websites so that should a problem arise, 
a technology administrator can access a student’s (or teacher’s) browsing history. In our 
experience, districts do not ban government (.gov) or education websites (.edu), which is 
one reason that the online resources for data we have shared in this book are primarily 
government resources (for example, U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], and Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]). And 
policies do evolve. Access to YouTube at one time was blocked in Donna’s school district 
(and in others), but now is allowed with the activation of YouTube’s “Safety Mode.”

Teachers should be aware of their district’s policies before planning a student inves-
tigation using real-time data, and verify that students will indeed be able to access the 
information. Some districts maintain a list of blocked words that students cannot use in 
search-engine searches and that filter the search results that will display. Such limitations 
are in place for student protection; however, sometimes they interfere with legitimate 
learning activities. For instance, a school’s information technology filters can get in the 
way of accessing websites that include inappropriate terms used in a totally appropriate 
context. To deal with problems such as this, most school districts have a procedure for 
granting access to blocked websites, so it is best to make sure websites referred to in this 
book work with your district’s filters before incorporating them into students’ investiga-
tions. Some districts allow students and teachers different levels of access, so you should 
verify that each website is available for students, even if works with a teacher account. 
School systems are increasingly opting for bring-your-own-technology (BYOT) access, 
which allows students to bring laptops, tablets, and smartphones from home. Students who 
connect personal devices to the school network also will be limited by the district’s AUP, and 
often are required to acknowledge in writing that they will use BYOT access in accordance 
with district policies. District policies that were established on the basis of CIPA requirements 
often are inadequate. Keep in mind that CIPA was enacted in 2001, long before smartphones, 
social media, hot spots, and data plans. Many districts are struggling with how to balance 
their responsibility under the law with the realities of today’s technology. Some districts are 
moving to a “Responsible Use Policy” that shifts some of the accountability to students in an 
effort to accommodate BYOT while recognizing filtering limitations.
Students accessing websites and apps through their data plans are not subject to the 
same oversight and limitations as those accessing through the network. This can be a 
mixed blessing and should be approached with caution. For example, some districts do 
not allow students to download apps over their network. So, if you want to use apps to 
access real-time data, students might need to have to use their own data plan to download 
the app in class. This can be a problem for students with limited data plans. Networks that 
block all app downloads cannot single out one app for an exception as easily as they can 
for web addresses. So, you might want to ask students to download the apps they will 
need at home. Donna has found that if she tells students they can only have their phones 
out if the desired app is installed, students will suddenly find free space on their phones 
and available data on their plan!
OPERATING SYSTEMS
One of the most obvious issues with technology use in school concerns the type of operat-
ing system that runs computers and devices. Most school systems choose a platform and 
implement it district-wide, with labs and laptop carts using the same type of operating 
system. There are advantages and disadvantages to each, and whether your district uses a

Mac or Windows system really is not a challenge. However, students might bring in their 
own technology, which can be different from what the teacher is used to. This does not 
usually present a problem on computers because data are accessed through web browsers, 
which are nearly identical in function regardless of platform. If your student brings in a 
laptop with a different operating system, he or she will probably be able to navigate data 
websites easily without help.
Most tablets and smartphones use either an Apple (iOS) or an Android operating sys-
tem. There are a few Windows-based tablets and smartphones, but these are less common 
(although they are becoming more affordable). Between tablets and smartphones, there are 
more differences in how data are accessed because of the differences in web browsers and 
apps used for each type of system. These can be more challenging to manage when collect-
ing real-time data, but can be easily used if you know what to expect. Although some apps 
that allow students access to real-time data are available on both platforms, many are only 
available on one platform or the other. Many apps are developed by individuals or small 
software firms who might not be able to justify the expense and complexity of writing 
native apps for more than one operating system. Even if the data are not accessible through 
an app on a particular device, they are often accessible through an internet browser.
RESPONSIVE DESIGN
One of the more common approaches for organizations that want to provide data on small 
devices is to build websites with responsive design techniques, which run exclusively in 
a browser but can scale content to fit large, medium, or small devices. For example, if you 
are viewing a responsive web page on a desktop computer, you would see the full website 
page; however, on a tablet or a smartphone, that website’s content would compress and 
“snap” to the size of that smaller screen. Responsive software makes choices about what 
content is shown and which becomes hidden, based on the device type and size.
One way to tell whether a website uses responsive design is by opening it on a desktop 
or laptop computer and reducing the size of the browser window. If the content adapts 
intelligently to the window size—collapses menus and reorganizes itself—the site has been 
built using responsive design and will work as a web-based app on a smartphone or tablet. 
However, if all you see in the smaller browser window is a fraction of the original content, 
then the design is not responsive. The USGS Earthquake webpage for the latest events has 
a responsive design (Figure 2.1, p. 20). A full-screen version on your computer shows data 
for recent earthquakes and a map; however, with a smaller window or on a smartphone 
screen, you will see just the data and must select a separate icon to view the map.
Using responsive design websites in lieu of native apps has advantages and disadvan-
tages. One advantage is that students can access the data through the browser on a tablet 
or smartphone without needing to download an app. Also, the controls and settings are 
integrated into the browser, making it easier to navigate. However, this type of data access

such as an accelerometer or a camera. Sometimes only certain pages on a website are built 
with responsive design, so be sure to provide students with specific pages to view when 
gathering real-time data from their browser.
NATIVE APPS
Native apps are developed for specific devices that use a single operating system. To develop 
the same app for both an Android device and an iPhone, the app developer usually must 
write it twice—once in each language. Some developers use software with an integration 
platform designed to develop apps that run on both iOS and Android with a near-native 
look and feel. Sometimes such apps are not as good as those written in a native language, 
and they might not work well for highly interactive applications; however, in most cases, 
you will notice little difference. Regardless, many apps are only available for one platform 
or the other, so when you want to use apps for teaching, you should plan on using cross-
platform apps, web-based apps, or native apps that are similar in the data they provide.

USING APPS FOR ACCESSING REAL-TIME DATA
Donna often prefers using apps over websites in her classroom when 
working with real-time data. She finds that many apps target specific 
data for student investigations, and students are confined to the data 
and resources provided in the app. This can help students focus and 
avoid distractions. The first requirement for any app is that it be free; 
you cannot expect students to pay for an app. Some apps are totally 
free, whereas for others, the free version has less functionality and a 
paid version has more functionality. With so many apps available for 
accessing real-time data, finding a free option usually is not a problem.
The real challenge is finding the right app for each operating system. 
If you are really lucky, you will find an app that has been developed 
for both platforms. For example, one of the best apps for exploring cli-
mate is called Weather History Explorer (Figure 2.2), which is available 
for Android and iOS, with both versions having the same look and feel.
When looking through an app store online, 
availability of two identical app icons is a clue 
that an app might be available on both the iOS 
and Android platforms. Some organizations 
invest in building apps for both platforms. 
One example is the American Red Cross, 
whose excellent safety apps for natural disas-
ters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, 
and wildfires are available on both platforms. 
The United Nations also has identical apps 
for environmental science; for example, FAO 
Now, which deals with world hunger issues, 
and Applifish, which provides information 
about endangered marine species. It is worth 
the time to look for these apps before looking 
for apps for separate platforms.
Sometimes, the same app is not available 
for both operating system, and you have to 
find similar apps for each platform. This takes 
a little more effort. You can begin by search-
ing for data apps within a web browser or an 
app store. Start with the device you have (iOS- or Android-based) and find an app you 
like. Identify its features you find most helpful, then look for a similar app for the other 
platform. It helps to have a student, colleague, or friend who can help with the search for 
Figure 2.2.

FINDING AN APP
There are several possible strategies 
for finding a usable app that you like:
•	 Browse the app selection in the 
“science” or “weather” section of 
the app store.
•	 Conduct an online search with 
terms such as “earthquake app” 
or “buoy app” – often the results 
returned will include someone’s 
“top ten” list of apps for your 
desired data topic.
•	 Ask students to find apps dealing 
with your topic (for example, 
ocean currents, hurricanes, 
weather, earthquakes).

the alternative app and try it out on their device. Donna is an iPhone user and more than 
once has called her daughter to find an Android app that will provide the desired data. 
Alternatively, sometimes she just carefully evaluates the information and screenshots pro-
vided for each option in the app store to verify an app’s suitability.
Today’s students are digital natives and are likely to have far fewer problems than their 
teachers in interacting with apps. It often is unnecessary to spend a great deal of time 
figuring out all the nuances; just make sure the app will let you access the same data. For 
the lessons we provide in this book, we have recommended apps for each platform when 
a single, multiplatform app is not available. However, you might find an alternative app 
that you prefer.
Regardless of which apps you include in each lesson, you should check their settings and 
filters. The settings for many apps allow you to select the units you use. Science teachers 
usually want students to use metric units, such as kilometers for distance. For common use, 
most weather apps report air pressure in inches and temperature in Fahrenheit, but for real-
time data investigations, students should work in millibars and degrees Celsius. Earthquake 
app settings generally default to report all events of magnitude 2.5 and higher; however, the 
number of earthquakes reported under that setting will be very high, and setting that filter 
to magnitude 4.0 or higher will return a manageable data set for students. On more than one 
occasion, Donna has asked her students with Android devices to help her find menu options.
You cannot always explore all aspects of your chosen parallel apps before a lesson, and 
sometimes problems arise when using an app for the first time. Students solve problems 
for each other so quickly that in most cases, such problems are resolved almost before 
you are even aware of them. (Having students work in groups can facilitate this.) Should 
a problem arise that cannot be solved, though, students will need to team up to gather 
data on one device or another, or will need to access data through a web browser. Donna 
usually ensures that each app-based lesson includes a universal resource locator (URL) for 
web-based data collection in case app problems arise or devices are unavailable.
USING QR CODES
A Quick Response Code (QR Code) is a two-dimensional, matrix bar code that uses an 
array of black and white squares that is encoded with a link to a website. Figure 2.3 is a QR 
Code that when scanned by a smartphone or tablet will take you directly to the home page 
of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA). QR Codes are useful in investigations 
with real-time data because they can be generated to take students directly to websites or 
apps to download. Creating a QR Code is easy— just navigate to a QR Code–generating 
website and enter the URL of the desired web page. The matrix image produced can be 
added into your lesson, printed for handout, or projected onto the board. Students use a 
barcode scanner app to read the QR Code via their device’s camera, upon which the web 
page the QR Code is linked to opens in the device’s browser window. There are many

free barcode scanner apps available for iOS- and Android-based 
devices and Windows-based tablets. When planning a lesson using 
websites and/or apps, using a QR Code eliminates student errors 
in entering URLs or finding specific apps. It makes the search for 
data quick and easy.
A NOTE ABOUT TIME
One of the first things you might notice when collecting real-time 
data is that often the events being reported seem to be happening 
in the future. For example, when looking at USGS real-time data at 
6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 29, the data 
might show a seismic event to have happened after 10:00 p.m. that evening—four hours 
later than now. Similarly, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
buoy data also might be from nearly 10:00 p.m. that evening. These discrepancies in time 
do not mean these events are predicted; rather, they are events that have already occurred 
but are reported in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
When working with real-time data, take some time to explain to students that scientists 
report all data, including planetary data, using UTC to synchronize recorded events. UTC is 
a 24-hour system of time zones that move outward from the Prime Meridian. UTC is fixed 
and does not adjust seasonally; for example, for daylight savings time. Having a standard for 
reporting is important. Scientists are often geographically separated and use data collected 
from different locations. Recording events using a standard timekeeping system makes data 
more useful. Table 2.1 shows the time differences between UTC and other U.S. time zones.

Calculating the UTC depends on where you are and what time of the year it is. In the 
winter, UTC is eight hours later than Pacific Standard Time (PST), while Pacific Daylight 
time is only seven hours later. As long as students are accessing data and working with

real-time data, the time difference is not a problem. Unless they are using their own data 
with a real-time data set, they will always be comparing data using the same system. It is 
worth making sure that your students understand that the times in the data are not the 
same as local time. Should you ever need to convert UTC time to local time, there are many 
online calculators that can help with the conversion.
MANAGING DEVICES
Although smartphones and tablets are becoming more common in all sections of society, 
not all students will have access to one. No student should ever feel disadvantaged or left 
out for not having a device. Even students who have their own devices might have restric-
tions that prevent them from downloading or accessing data. Teachers generally know their 
students and can plan accordingly. If approximately half of the students in a class bring a 
personal smartphone or tablet, that is more than enough to conduct investigations with 
real-time data using student devices. Although a few will find some reason why they can-
not look up the data or download an app, even though they can easily enough send text 
messages, students can share and conduct their investigations in small groups, rather than 
individually. Also, in many areas, device availability is not a problem because many school 
districts now provide tablets for classroom use. If this is not the case for your district, the 
data we discuss here also can be accessed using laptop or desktop computers. According 
to the Pew Research Center (Lenhart 2015), more than half of American teenagers currently 
have access to and use smartphones. That means that most teachers are likely to have 
enough students in their classes who have devices to allow for easy access to real-time data.
As any teacher of students with smartphones knows, managing those devices in the 
classroom can be challenging. Students are constantly texting their parents and each other, 
and seem addicted to social media. If you are using an app, begin the lesson by asking 
students to start the download and put the phone or tablet face-down in front of them on 
their desk. You will immediately know how many devices are available for the activity and 
how to modify your lesson, if necessary. Ask also that all cell phones that do not have the 
app and are not downloading it be put away.
Donna has found that when students use their devices for interaction with real-time 
data, they usually stay on task and often report using the app independently on their own 
time. If you need app settings to be changed, incorporate that into your lesson. If you are 
providing instructions via a whiteboard presentation, be sure to include some screenshots 
of the app or website—for iOS devices and many Android devices, this is done by simul-
taneously holding down the home and power buttons—and email them yourself so you 
can embed them in your lesson instructions. And of course, remember to use a QR Code to 
help students find the right app or web page easily.

GRAPHING DATA
After students collect the real-time data for their investigations, they usually are expected 
to do something evaluative with it; for example, produce a map, chart, or graph. Chapter 
4 discusses processing and graphing data in great detail, so we will not go into it here; 
however, we will cover some technology issues here related to graphing data. Electronic 
spreadsheets are commonly used for producing graphs. Microsoft Excel is one of the most 
common spreadsheet programs and is available as an app for iOS and Android platforms. 
Spreadsheet programs use columns and rows for data entry, and then can create a graph 
that visually represents those data.
Using spreadsheet programs effectively involves knowing not only what type of graph 
is best for representing the data, but also how make the program produce that graph. For 
example, when creating a scatter plot in Excel, it is important to put only numerical data 
in your two data columns. When creating a bar graph or line graph, though, the data 
for the x-axis must be text; otherwise, the values in both columns will be represented as 
data bars or points on the graph that is produced (for example, see Figure 2.4). You can 
display a graph’s data table with the graph easily enough by choosing an alternative chart 
layout. Graphs also can be customized by reversing their axes, inserting data tables and 
trend lines, and adding axis labels. If you plan to ask students to create a graph using a 
spreadsheet, be sure to let them know how to set up the data to produce the correct graph.

Another option for producing graphs is to use an app or a website. On websites such 
as Datacopia (www.datacopia.com) and Raw (http://app.raw.densitydesign.org), you can insert 
raw data into a text box and it will create several graph options for those data. Some of 
these sites use responsive design, meaning they will reformat their interface to work easily 
on devices with different screen sizes. This option is great for simple data sets, but is not 
appropriate if you want to produce more-complex data visualizations. For example, such 
sites do not allow the axes to be reversed. Also, to select the correct visualization from those 
the site generates, students must understand which of the graphs produced is the most 
appropriate. Some free apps are available as well, such as Graph for iOS and Free Graph for 
Android. Google Sheets is also available as a free app and can be used on both platforms.
If you are working with younger students, there are learning benefits from having the 
students manually enter the data into tables (as discussed in Chapter 4) and graph it. In 
these cases, teachers can use a scaffolding approach (providing them partially to fully 
designed table and graph templates) before having them drawing the tables and graphs 
by hand on blank paper. In addition, the website Create-a-Graph (https://nces.ed.gov/nceskids/
createagraph) is designed for younger students and can help them produce graphs (although 
we would still encourage them to learn the fundamentals first through graphing by hand).
SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have discussed many of the technological aspects of retrieving and 
processing real-time data. Not all classrooms will look the same; many teachers have labs 
that use desktops, laptops, and even portable tablets. Many teachers will take advantage of 
the BYOT devices students bring with them to class and transform those smartphones and 
tablets into authentic learning tools by using them to access real-time data. Whatever tools 
you need to use in your classroom, we hope you found information here that will help you 
identify and manage the technology issues that might arise as your students engage in 
investigations using real-time data.

CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS 
WITH REAL-TIME DATA
B
efore the internet brought us into the Information Age, teachers often depended 
on current events to bring their students valuable teachable moments. News sto-
ries about an earthquake half a world away or a local weather event would have 
provided an authentic learning opportunity that actively engaged students. But access to 
real-world investigations was limited geographically and temporally—unless an event 
was “newsworthy” and received media coverage, it was not easily available for investiga-
tion. Access to real-time data has opened up a world of authentic learning experiences 
that require analysis skills and critical thinking. Using real-time data sets in student inves-
tigations is more challenging than using data sets from textbooks; however, the experi-
ence is more motivating to students and allows them to experience higher achievement 
(McKay and McGrath 2006).
Classroom investigations that use real-time data have characteristics that can make them 
more challenging for both the student and the teacher. They often involve problems and 
problem solving that are ill-structured, complex, dynamic, and collaborative (McKay and 
McGrath 2006). Complex problems such as investigations using real-time data contain large 
and diverse number elements that are interconnected (Funke 2010). Because data are con-
tinuously collected and reported, each data set is dynamic, and the investigation one day 
might be different from the investigation the day before or after it. The questions could 
change, and the answers would shift with each new exploration.
Working with real-time data develops deeper understanding of concepts because the 
data are not always neat and clean, and sometimes are incomplete. For instance, when 
students gather streamflow data to investigate relationships between precipitation and 
stream discharge, they might find that some information is missing and other informa-
tion is irrelevant to their investigation. Students will need to apply their understanding of 
potential variables to conduct their investigation, and then justify their results to others in 
a collaborative environment.
LEVELS OF INQUIRY
It is important that students be scaffolded into these real-time data activities in a way 
that increases the likelihood of their success in their investigation. All too often, we have

seen teachers engage their students through opposite extremes—either giving them far too 
many instructions, such that all students are doing the same investigation with the same 
data set, or giving them no instructions, so that they flounder and have difficulty decid-
ing what to do with what data. Teachers should use their knowledge of their students to 
decide how best to engage them. 
Traditional science investigations can be broken down into different components, and 
often are taught as step-by-step activities that give students effectively no leeway in the inves-
tigation; however, that is not the type of investigation we are promoting in this book. Tamir 
(1991) suggested an approach to conducting laboratory investigations that moves students 
toward working more independently and thus helps them develop better critical-thinking 
and problem-solving skills. His approach comprises four levels of inquiry in the science labo-
ratory (Table 3.1), which we believe is a good starting point for thinking about this issue.

Teachers tend to interpret information such as that in Table 3.1 as meaning that students 
can do anything they want; however, that is not how we propose you use it. Rather, it is 
a structure by which an investigation might be varied to add interest and/or complexity. 
As an example, say you have a topic you want them to investigate (for example, what is it 
like for a marine bird to live in the ocean ecosystem) and resources you want them to use 
(for example, buoys on the Atlantic coast of the United States). In a traditional investiga-
tion activity (that is, Level 0) students all address the same question (for example, What is 
the wave action like at Buoy x at date/time y?) and are expected to get the same answer. 
A Level 1 activity might have all students use the same sampling approach and answer 
the same question but let each group choose what buoy’s data they investigate. A Level 2 
activity might let each group develop their own sampling approach and defend it to oth-
ers (but with everyone using data from the same buoy). A Level 3 approach might allow 
groups to ask their own question, for example, “What is the relationship between wave 
action and closeness to shore?” 
Tamir’s method can also be used to differentiate activities to allow students with different 
academic needs to work on different investigations using the same data set. Some teachers 
allow students to look at Tamir’s table and pick the activity level they are comfortable doing.

An advantage of using this framework for helping the students design their own investiga-
tions is that each group will have its own data set and argument to present to others for  
discussion—which is exactly what scientists do when they present their research at confer-
ences. Figure 3.1 shows wind, wave, temperature, and other ocean-conditions data from a 
National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy near Breezy Point, New York. Using these data, 
what type of investigation could your students conduct at each of Tamir’s levels of inquiry?

DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN INVESTIGATIONS AND 
EXPERIMENTS
In school labs, students are most accustomed to performing experiments, procedures in 
which they manipulate one variable (such as temperature) to see what effect it has on 
another variable (such as solubility). This type of research examines the causal relationship 
between the variables. For example, in an experiment involving temperature and solubil-
ity, students would find that temperature affects solubility, and in their conclusion, could 
claim this relationship. The causal nature of the relationship can be seen directly.
Most of the investigations in this book focus on relationships between the variables 
being examined. Causality (one variable causing the other to change) is hard to determine 
and, at best, it can be only inferred if a number of conditions are met (see Bowen and

Bartley 2014 for details). For instance, in an investigation examining wind speed (mea-
sured by buoys) and distance from the shore, we divide the buoys’ proximity to shore into 
three ranges: close, medium, and far. These data can help us to determine the relationship 
between wind speed and distance from shore, but not that one variable caused the other. 
Investigations can be categorized as two types—primary and secondary—by looking at 
the source of the data. Investigations that are designed to collect and then analyze data 
are often referred to as primary investigations. Those that use data collected by others are 
known as secondary investigations. This book’s investigations are almost all secondary 
investigations because students will use data collected by others.
Because this book’s investigations use secondary data, students must do their best to 
understand several things about the data being collected, including 
•	
how the original investigators are using the data,
•	
how the data are being collected, and
•	
what the limitations of those data might be.
Understanding these issues, particularly the last two, is important for conclusions that 
students might draw from the data. For instance, wave action can be collected in a number 
of different ways, some of which are more sensitive than others. If a large floating buoy 
is used to record wave action, for example, then small waves might not be accurately or 
completely recorded. Variations in readings from the large buoy might be small waves,  
or might just be noise. Understanding how data are collected helps to identify limitations 
of those data and what types of conclusions can be drawn from them.
SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PRACTICES
When planning investigations using real-time data, you should provide opportunities for 
students to engage in the science and engineering practices defined in the Next Generation 
Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States 2013) and A Framework for K–12 Science Educa-
tion: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas (NRC 2012). These practices actively 
engage students in the process of science in a way that requires critical-thinking and 
problem-solving skills. Activities often involve multiple practices that are not carried out 
in isolation from each other and that can be implemented in a range of activities and on any 
of Tamir’s (1991) levels of inquiry. There are multiple ways to use each data set, as well as 
different levels of support that can be integrated into each investigation. The science and 
engineering practices identified in the framework are
•	
Asking questions (for science) and defining problems (for engineering);
•	
Developing and using models;

Asking Questions and Defining Problems
A somewhat oversimplified way of stating the difference between science and engineering 
is to say they have a difference in purpose—the process of science addresses “how” and 
“why” questions to explain the natural world, whereas the process of engineering seeks to 
solve problems. Real-time data can be used in both disciplines. For example, in a guided 
exploration of seasonal patterns, students can use real-time data to explore how the length 
of the solar day changes through the year (Figure 3.2). Because questions often arise from 
observation, you could ask students to research seasonal changes in the length of the day 
at different latitudes. In addition, you might ask them to determine whether there is a 
relationship between climate and the length of the solar day, as well as research what other 
variables might account for this observed phenomenon.

Because of the ill-structured nature of real-time data, students will discover that there 
is a correlation between climate and latitude, but will also find that other variables are 
involved, which will spur other questions. For example, Paris, France, and St. John’s, 
Newfoundland, are at equivalent latitudes, 48°N and 47°N. It seldom snows in Paris, yet 
St. John’s is much colder and gets more than 10 feet of snow per year. So, although the 
photoperiod of these two locations is the same on any given day, their climates are very 
different. Just presenting students with differences such as these will generate questions 
that are perfect for guiding student investigations. Students could also use the data in 
this example for engineering applications, for example, to identify energy demands and 
resources needed to solve regional energy supply problems.
Developing and Using Models
A model, in this context, refers to a conceptual or mental representation of a phenom-
enon or phenomena. It can include drawings, simulations, and diagrams, but also can 
include (and usually does, in science) mathematical and 
graphical representations. Real-time data can be used 
to construct multiple types of models to help students 
better visualize and demonstrate scientific phenomena. 
Creating a graph with real-time data is just one exam-
ple. Another would be mapping plate movement using 
real-time data for plate motion.
For example, using the plate-motion calculator on the 
UNAVCO website (www.unavco.org/software/geodetic-
utilities/plate-motion-calculator/plate-motion-calculator.
html), students can find how fast tectonic plates under 
various world cities are moving, and construct a map 
using vectors showing the speed and direction of plate 
movement. The map produced is a model that can help 
us to visualize how Earth’s crust changes over time. 
Such a model could be useful as part of an engineer-
ing task to determine what geologic stresses should be 
addressed through building codes for a given location. 
Real-time data can be used to create a model or to pro-
vide a model for analysis and interpretation.
Planning and Carrying Out Investigations
The practice of planning and carrying out investigations is the one most easily enacted 
with real-time data. Planning and carrying out investigations involves describing the 
world around us and testing explanations about how it works. Exploring an Earth science 
MODELS
In science, models can be 
terribly complex or very simple. 
Believe it or not, you already 
know about the simple type 
of science model—drawing a 
scatter plot, fitting the line of 
best fit, and determining the 
equation of that line (in the old 
y = mx + b format) gives you 
a simple scientific model. But 
models are really useful when 
they allow you to predict what 
will happen in a future scenario.

or environmental science concept involves testing variables and exploring relationships. 
Sometimes investigations begin with the data. For example, air-quality data for the six 
pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can be downloaded 
from their website into a spreadsheet and graphed (Figure 3.3). Such data can engender 
research questions for students to investigate. For example:
•	
What inferences can be made from the data?
•	
What variables affect the observed variations in the data?
•	
What additional data need to be collected to determine relationships among 
variables?
•	
How can the data be used to support student hypotheses?
•	
What is the relationship among the levels of the different pollutants (that is, does 
one go up when another goes down)?
Other times, investigations begin with observations, and real-time data then can pro-
vide evidence to test explanations or develop new theories. In engineering, real-time data 
can help provide important information for design criteria.

Analyzing and Interpreting Data
All real-time data investigations involve analyzing and interpreting data. The instructional 
challenge is in helping students make sense of those data. Finding the right data, narrow-
ing down very large data sets, and presenting the data in a useful way for analysis are 
among the many challenges of working with real-time data. So much information is avail-
able that it can be overwhelming; however, keep in mind that today’s students are part of 
the digital generation, and can be resourceful in filtering through an abundance of links 
and resources to find just the right data they need. Sometimes they need to be directed to 
targeted data resources within a specific website or app.
Table 3.2 shows an example of the how complex data sets can be simplified for students. 
These data were extracted from a complex set of radiosonde data for Little Rock, Arkansas, for 
December 22, 2015 (University of Wyoming). A radiosonde is an atmospheric data-collection 
instrument that often is carried aloft by a weather balloon. The original data set contained 
11 columns and more than 300 rows of data and included not just what is in this table, but 
also air pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, and other information for hundreds of alti-
tudes as the radiosonde ascended. Not all of those data are necessary for students to explore 
the relationship between altitude and atmospheric temperature. Determining which data are 
needed is the first factor to consider in an investigation. The second consideration is how to 
trim the available data set to a manageable size. For example, using every tenth data point is 
likely sufficient for student investigations. Too much data can overwhelm students (depend-
ing on their age and previous knowledge of the subject, of course), and they need to know 
what to focus on; however, abundant data resources should not necessarily be disregarded, 
either. By discussing the types of data provided, students might generate new questions for 
further investigation or discover possible relationships to explore.
Once the data have been found, the most common challenge is what to do with them. 
Models are one way of visualizing data, and include graphs and charts. Graphing data 
is one of the most difficult concepts for students to grasp, and is challenging for even the 
most advanced students. Although rules such as ”use line graphs for data over time” and 
”use bar graphs for comparisons” are generally sound advice, special types of graphs exist 
that do not fit those rules. Also, these exceptions to the rules can vary greatly by science 
discipline or subdiscipline. However, that there are general rules (see Chapter 4) as well 
as discipline-based exceptions does not mean that anything goes. For example, the Stüve 
profile chart in Figure 3.4 (p. 36) shows a vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere 
over Little Rock, Arkansas. Knowing what to do to visualize data is not easy, and students 
will need help with analyzing and interpreting real-time data. Chapter 4 will go into detail 
on how to help students visualize, analyze, and interpret real-time data. It is important to 
provide instruction that guides students through the process of analysis and interpretation 
using discussion, questions, and even direct instruction, whether the purpose of the inves-
tigation is to understand a scientific principle or to design an engineering task.

Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
From understanding the units used in reporting various data to describing relationships 
and predicting outcomes, the use of mathematics is the foundation on which real-time data 
analysis rests. Whether a student is interpreting earthquake magnitude using the logarith-
mic Richter scale or calculating the rate at which a glacier is retreating, working with real-
time data requires mathematical reasoning and computational skills, and the importance 
of these cannot be overstated. A Framework for K–12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting 
Concepts, and Core Ideas (NRC 2012) stresses the role of mathematics in working with data:

Mathematics (including statistics) and computational tools are essential for data 
analysis, especially for large data sets. The abilities to view data from different 
perspectives and with different graphical representations, to test relationships 
between variables, and to explore the interplay of diverse external conditions 
all require mathematical skills that are enhanced and extended with computa-
tional skills. (NRC 2012, p. 65).
Not all real-time data sets will require advanced calculations. Depending on the activity, 
students might only need to understand units or orders of magnitude, or be able to calcu-
late slope to understand trends in the data. Seldom will the learning objective be the cal-
culations themselves; rather, it will be to understand how data are used to understand and 
interpret the world. So when planning an investigation, it is often best to try to simplify 
the computations and focus instead on the big ideas—using real-time data to investigate 
Earth’s systems and our environment.

Constructing Explanations (for Science) and Designing 
Solutions (for Engineering)
In science, explanations tie together observations, and 
explanations and data are brought together to develop 
theories. Data provide evidence that supports scien-
tific understandings. Explanations incorporate data 
in making inferences, predicting events, and provid-
ing evidence for causal relationships. For applications 
using real-time data, this means letting the data support 
and reinforce the concepts presented. Whatever those 
concepts are—a connection between sea-level rise and 
mean global temperatures, for example, or between 
land use and population trends—real-time data help 
students construct explanations.
In investigating the relationship between carbon 
dioxide (CO2) and ocean acidification, for example, data 
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration (NOAA) (Figure 3.5, p. 38), can provide a 
model to help students make connections. The graphs 
in the figure plot the daily data collected by a buoy off  
the coast of southern California. Since 2012, this buoy 
has collected data on the pH level of the ocean water 
and the CO2 level of the seawater and the atmosphere. 
There are expected gaps in the data, but trends are clear 
none the less. The graphs show that as the seawater’s CO2 level increased, its pH level 
decreased. A decrease in pH means the water has become more acidic.
Such a relationship could be predicted by understanding that when CO2 mixes with 
seawater, it forms carbonic acid. This affects sea life in multiple ways, including reducing 
the availability of carbonate ions, which are used by marine organisms that produce shells. 
The reduction in pH alone can create problems for sensitive organisms. This investigation 
is just one example of how real-time data can be used by students to construct expla-
nations in science. Those explanations then become the basis for developing criteria and 
constraints in engineering design.
Engaging in Argument From Evidence
Engaging in argument from evidence is probably the most useful scientific process for devel-
oping conceptual understanding. When students can build a case to support their explana-
tions, they are engaged with content at a deep and meaningful level. Building their case 
requires supporting evidence, and real-time data can be useful in supporting their claims. 
THEORY
In science, a theory is a big 
idea that pulls together broad 
patterns. Sometimes people 
talk about theory in science 
as though it means that we do 
not have enough information. 
That is, they will say, “Oh, 
it’s just a theory.” But that is 
an incorrect understanding 
of theory in science. To a 
scientist, calling something 
a theory usually means that 
there is a lot of evidence (that 
is, data) and that the data are 
pretty consistent, without any 
meaningful contradictions.

Teachers who have implemented argumentation strategies have found that when students 
are asked to use evidence to support their claims, they are engaged at a deeper level, their 
thinking processes are evident, and their misconceptions are revealed. Use of real-time data 
possibly is one of the best resources for students who are asked to develop an argument. 
For example, students might be asked to use real-time earthquake data as evidence to 
support the claim that the Australian Plate is subducting under the Pacific Plate. Using 
30-day earthquake data downloaded from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), students 
can locate seismic events along a specific plate boundary (Table 3.3). These data can be 
narrowed to certain geographic regions at the plate boundaries and then graphed (Fig-
ures 3.6 and 3.7, p. 40). Best-fit lines can help students visualize the plate boundary, and 
show where the deepest events occur along the leading edge of the subducting plate. 
These data can be used with other evidence, such as plate-motion calculations discussed 
earlier (Developing and Using Models, p. 32) to provide evidence for the claim that the  
Australian Plate is subducting under the Pacific Plate.

world is built on sound, data-supported evi-
dence and start to build their own skills in 
scientific reasoning. Engineering practices also 
rely on data to help make choose the best solu-
tions in design decisions.
Obtaining, Evaluating, and 
Communicating Information
Science is a collaborative process and cannot be 
conducted in isolation. It is a social process; the 
work done by one scientist is built on by others. 
For science to progress, one scientist’s findings 
must be communicated and evaluated by other 
scientists. Whether those findings are sup-
ported or rejected by the scientific community, 
through this process science moves forward. 
To understand the social nature of science, stu-
dents must have opportunities to investigate 
phenomena, communicate their results, and 
evaluate the findings of others. Using real-time 
data in student explorations engages students 
in an authentic learning experience. Conclu-
sions they make in investigations are based on 
actual data, not simulations from a fictitious 
scenario. Events represented by the data can be 
experienced as they happen in the real world. 
Obtaining real-time data to support investiga-
tions is easier than ever with tablet and smart-
phone technologies; however, evaluating those 
data still requires critical-thinking skills and 
interpretation built on conceptual understand-
ings. The more students engage in these practices, the better grasp they will have of the 
content and the deeper understanding they will have of how science works. 
SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have shown how real-time data can be used to engage students in 
scientific and engineering practices, as suggested by A Framework for K–12 Science Educa-
tion: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas (NRC 2012). Although it is not realistic 
to incorporate every practice into every investigation, most lessons integrate multiple

practices. At the very least, every investigation with real-time data will include the prac-
tices of obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information; analyzing and interpreting 
data; and constructing explanations. Visual or graphical models also may be included in 
most activities. Mathematical thinking, argumentation, planning investigations, and ask-
ing questions are also common components of investigations using real-time data. What 
your students get out of the experience will depend on what criteria you set, what ques-
tions you ask, and what problems students are expected to solve. To help your students 
understand the data they are using, it would be helpful to explore types of data and ways 
to process them, and how to graph real-time data (see Chapter 4).

DATA TYPES, REPRESENTATION, 
AND ANALYSIS
T
he data sets discussed in 
this book are very differ-
ent in many ways from the 
types of data that are normally 
used in schools. The biggest differ-
ence is that these data sets can be 
huge—thousands and thousands 
of numbers—almost too big to deal 
with, and so require different han-
dling than the data students more 
typically use in school. Their size 
and complexity necessitate that 
students make different kinds of 
decisions in using them, decisions 
that students are more than capable 
of making.
As an example, imagine stu-
dents asking the question “What 
is the wind speed along an ocean 
coast?” Researching this question 
would involve a large data set, and 
so students also would need to ask 
“When?” because the data could 
contain tens of thousands of mea-
surements over many years. They 
also would need to ask “Where?” 
because those tens of thousands of 
measurements could include hun-
dreds of places that wind speed is 
measured on ocean coasts. Helping 
HOW MANY SAMPLES OR 
REPLICATES?
A question to be considered in every study is 
how many samples or replicates are needed. 
Whether you use samples or replicates will 
depend on your study. For example, for the 
wind-speed question in the discussion, the 
sample is the number of sites you choose 
along the coast (for example, 10 locations), 
and the replicate is the number of data 
points, the number of times you collect data 
from each of those sites (for example, every 
data point in one week, once a week for 52 
weeks). On the other hand, you could also 
sample 1,000 spots along the coast just 
once. Students often collect the number 
as instructed by a teacher; however, this 
does not really represent what happens in 
real-world science. The number of samples or 
replicates in real-world science is often based 
on (a) what is possible time- and money-wise, 
(b) the researchers’ judgement of whether 
the (suspected) range of possible data has 
been adequately represented, and/or  
(c) whether the number of samples/replicates 
will be convincing to other researchers.

students learn to narrow their question to a manageable scope is important for their success 
in working with real-time data.
There are many solutions that help students refocus their questions; these usually help 
the students reframe their research question into a more specific focus, e.g, narrowing the 
wind-speed question above to evaluate a few specific coastal locations and/or a specific 
time of day rather than the 24-hour period. With the research question framed this way, 
students might then collect data for wind speed measured at noon on one day at 10 ran-
dom sites along a coast. Or, they might pick 10 specific places (known as a purposive sample) 
and collect the data for a given time every day for a seven-day period. Or, they might use 
wind-speed data obtained every hour for one week in February and one week in August to 
compare the mean (arithmetically averaged) wind speed in different seasons. The answers 
that the students get to their questions depend on such decisions about the specificity of 
their approach. There really is no right or wrong to those decisions (unless the teacher has 
made specific requests).
A multitude of questions could be asked, and you can help each student group set an 
analytic task that is based on data samples with which they can be successful. A group of 
on-target students could do more data points in all four seasons; another group could do 
wind speed at noon daily at one location over a month. Your highest-achieving students 
could compare wind speeds and temperatures over a year (that is, look at whether wind 
speed and temperature correlate). Helping students develop a focused research question 
that they can deal with successfully takes a bit of time, but it reduces problems in the analy-
sis and conclusion-drawing stages of their investigations. Once students have collected 
their data subset, they must decide what they need to do with it to analyze it so that they 
will be able to show others what they found (that is, to describe their findings and make 
sense of them). Scientists use tables and graphs to help accomplish all of these tasks, and 
the following part of this chapter is about helping students learn to do that, as well.
This chapter outlines some of the basic data types that are used in investigations and 
discusses how to represent and then analyze those data variables in tables and graphs. It 
provides a general background in data analysis that can improve the effectiveness of the 
student investigations and the conclusions students draw from them using the activities 
in this book. It also discusses a specific approach that scientists use in describing their 
findings, that is, their use of hedging language in talking about the patterns in a data set 
and the conclusions that can be drawn from the research. Finally, it discusses some types 
of data that are exceptions to the rule when calculating arithmetic means.
This focus on constructing appropriate data tables and graphs might seem “old school,” 
but time and again we have seen students jotting data down randomly on a page or writ-
ing narrative observations while they are collecting them, rather than placing them in an 
appropriately designed table. In real-world science, data tables are used by researchers 
to allow them to visually inspect the data for patterns and trends as they are collecting the

data. This visual inspection partly allows a judgment to 
be made about whether a particular value is an outlier 
(one that deviates notably from the overall pattern) that 
might need to be re-collected or ignored (both of which 
are common practice in science for outlier data points), 
or whether there are other implications that should be 
noted. Some scientists say they look for patterns by 
mentally drawing a graph of the data as they collect 
them in data tables.
In this chapter, we describe table structures used with 
different types of data variables and describe how these 
facilitate data analysis and the emerging understanding 
of the phenomena being studied in the research project. 
Helping students structure effective data tables (for 
example, by the teacher checking the tables in advance 
and providing advice on their structure) at the data  
collection/sampling stage is useful, because having the 
data organized properly early on helps students with 
their overall research analysis. Students will have fewer 
problems with data analysis if they have structured their 
data tables well.
Graphing software programs make it seem that there 
are dozens, if not hundreds, of different graph types; 
however, in science, most disciplines tend to use three 
main types: bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots. 
Other types also are used sometimes, but we will start 
with those three. Graphs are used in most science reports 
that involve quantitative data and are important in sci-
ence because they summarize large data sets and show 
data trends very efficiently—which allows patterns to 
be better understood. As judges of science fair projects, 
we have noted that students frequently use the wrong 
type of graph to represent their data, which often leads 
to misinterpretation of those data and incorrect conclu-
sions. When the right type of graph is used to present 
data, it tells the right story, which is important when 
working with primary or secondary data.
VARIABLES
Variables are human-defined. 
They are identified and 
defined as part of the 
process of investigating an 
observed phenomenon, as a 
way of making sense of that 
observation. Scientists identify 
and define variables as part 
of the process of formally 
investigating an observed 
phenomenon. For instance, 
after watching lizards in the 
wild, a herpetologist might 
want to figure out whether 
the size of lizards is related to 
how far they are from a forest’s 
edge. This would require the 
scientist to define forest’s 
edge so that the measurement 
could be made from there to 
where the lizard was caught. 
But how then to actually define 
forest’s edge? Sometimes 
boundaries between habitats 
are abrupt, but many times 
are not. For example, habitat 
borders can have gaps that 
contain yet other habitats. 
Defining variables is essential 
to conducting scientific 
investigations, but it is often 
harder to do than it might at 
first seem.

UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA
Students and teachers often find data analysis difficult because the different types, or 
orders, of data variables are rarely taught or explicitly discussed and so are often not 
well understood. Data types are not usually taught in high school or in university sci-
ence classes, but understanding them—and there are basically only three—can make 
data analysis much more straightforward. When Mike has given presentations on this 
at teacher conferences, he has experienced high school 
teachers who have been teaching for over 20 years tell 
him they had never known about these distinctions, and 
that knowing them now has made data and analysis 
much clearer to them. Understanding the basic types of 
independent (that is, x-axis or causal) data provides a 
framework for making decisions about how to visualize 
and analyze them. There are three basic types of data 
variables, each with specific characteristics and a type of 
graph usually used to represent it: nominal data (infor-
mally called category data), ordinal data (ordered category 
data), and interval–ratio1 data (measured data).
Nominal (Category) Variable
The simplest sort of variable is the nominal variable, also 
known as a category variable. Nominal variables have 
no intrinsic order. As an example of this, say you want to 
answer a question such as “Is wind speed greater in the 
morning or in the afternoon?” “Is the wind speed greater 
in the spring or the fall?” or “Is wind speed greater on 
the Pacific or Atlantic side of the United States?” In each 
case, the dependent variable is wind speed and the 
independent variable (which in this case is nominal) is 
the category being compared (time of day, time of year, 
or geographic location, respectively). Because nominal 
variables have no order of importance, in these exam-
ples, the variables in each pair—morning and afternoon, spring and fall, western United 
States and eastern United States—would have the same level of importance. This example 
uses only two components, but you could have many more. For instance, the question 
“What is the mean wind speed in the middle of each state?” is nominal-level, even though 
it involves 50 U.S. states as independent variables.
1.  The interval–ratio data type combines the interval and ratio data types. For the purposes of our discussion 
here, the difference between these data types is more or less immaterial. By one definition, interval data have a 
zero, but it does not necessarily mean anything in the big picture, whereas in “ratio” data the zero has meaning 
(for example, the distinction between 0°C [the freezing point of water only] and 0 kg of mass [which applies to all 
matter]. However, 0 Kelvin is a “ratio” variable because it refers to a state of molecular movement in all matter.)

In the following example using nominal data, we address the research question “What 
is the mean noontime temperature in late winter in cities on the east and west coasts of the 
United States?” To answer this, we picked a date (February 10, 2015) and 10 cities on each 
coast. We then obtained the data for each city from the internet and record it in a table (see 
example in Table 4.1).
The structure of Table 4.1 allows a researcher to scan the numbers to identify data 
anomalies (either a real difference in the data or a problem stemming from the data entry), 
and to visually compare the means calculated in the table. Even before graphing the data, 
a researcher might already be drawing tentative conclusions, for example, “the mean tem-
perature for East Coast cities seems to be slightly lower than for West Coast cities.” Stu-
dents often draw a false conclusion from tables such as this one, because they mistakenly 
think that the data values in the various columns on a given row are related to each other 
because they are on the same row. However, the data in this type of table are nominal-level, 
and so data items on the same row are not related to each other. In Table 4.1, for example, 
because the data are nominal-level, the recorded temperature for City 1 for the East Coast 
cities is unrelated to recorded temperature for City 1 for the West Coast cities. 
Figure 4.1. Mean temperature for 10 cities each on the East and West 
Coasts on February 10, 2015 (fictional data)
Nominal-level data are often represented in a bar graph or a histogram (which is used 
for frequencies). Pie charts can be used, but are less common in science publications. When 
graphing nominal-level data, it is common to use only the mean response, although there 
are good arguments saying that graphing the raw data as well as the mean allows students 
to draw conclusions more like those drawn in real-world science (Bowen and Bartley 2014). 
Note that Figure 4.1 (A) clearly shows a difference between the cities on the two coasts on 
that day at noon. An acceptable conclusion might be, “On average, temperatures recorded 
in cities on the West Coast of the United States in mid-February of 2015 were higher than 
those in cities on the East Coast.” It would be even better to conclude, “The arithmetic mean

of temperatures recorded in cities on the West Coast of the United States in mid-February of 
2015 was higher than that of temperatures recorded in cities on the East Coast.”
It is also common in science—and usually expected—to not only compare the mean values, 
but also comment on how the data scatter around the arithmetic mean (see Bowen and Bartley 
[2014] for more details on doing this visually and statistically) because this allows researchers 
to discuss the importance of the amount of the difference. One simple way of doing this that 
provides additional information is to compare the range of the data (difference between the 
highest and lowest measurements) to their mean. In the current example (Table 4.1), the East 
Coast cities have a temperature range of 4°C , and the West Coast cities have a range of 7°C. 
Figure 4.1 (B) illustrates this comparison of the range of the data in relation to the means by 
drawing a line representing 4°C and 7°C vertically across the respective means at the top of 
each bar (that is, 2 degrees above and below the East Coast bar, and 3.5 degrees above and 
below the West Coast bar). In our example, the difference 
between the mean temperatures of the West Coast cities 
CATEGORIES OF 
“DISTANCE FROM 
SHORE”
Why might a teacher use 
ordinal categories of distance 
from shore in a lesson instead 
of absolute measures of 
distance? One possible reason 
is that a teacher is working 
with younger students. In such 
a case, one group of students 
could figure out “nearshore” 
data, another group “medium 
distance from shore,” and a 
third group “far from shore.” 
Each group could report its 
findings to the class, and then 
the teacher could help the 
whole class work to understand 
the “big picture” by combining 
and evaluating the three 
groups’ findings.
and East Coast cities is 2.1°C (that is, 10.2°C minus 8.1°C). 
The sizes of the ranges in Figure 4.1 (B) suggest that there is 
considerable data overlap, which means that the tempera-
tures for at least some cities on one coast were similar to 
temperatures in some cities on the other coast. This, then, 
might change our conclusion to the following: 
In mid-February of 2015, the mean recorded 
temperature in cities on the U.S. West Coast was 
higher than in cities on the U.S. East Coast; how-
ever, there was a lot of overlap, which means 
that several cities on each coast had tempera-
tures that were similar to those of cities on the 
other coast.
Examining the extent of the overlap of the raw data (for 
which scientists use the standard deviation and a t-test; 
see Bowen and Bartley 2014) allows you to make stronger 
statements about differences between means. Also, these 
nominal-level data allow you to make statements about 
the data that were measured, but not to make predictions. 
For instance, the data in Table 4.1 cannot be used to pre-
dict the noon temperature in cities on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
Remember, nominal-level data do not allow you to make 
many types of predictions that you could test, other than 
for the existing categories you looked at.

Ordinal (Ordered Category) 
Variable
The next level of variable is the ordinal variable, also 
known as an ordered category variable. Ordinal vari-
ables can be ordered, for example, small, medium, 
large, and extra-large coffee cups. However, although 
they have an intrinsic order, these categories are not 
consistent multiples of each other, for example, the 
volume of two small cups of coffee does not neces-
sarily equal the volume of a medium cup. Another 
way of thinking about the ordinal variable is that it is 
comparative. “Medium” is variable in meaning. For 
example, one coffee shop’s medium coffee cup might 
not hold the same volume as another coffee shop’s 
medium cup. Nevertheless, both are “medium” size because each shop also sells smaller 
and larger cups of coffee.
Using the example of wave height, students could examine the difference in mean wave 
height between locations nearshore, a medium distance from shore, and far from shore. To 
do this, they would need to define the distance from shore for each of those distance cat-
egories. These would have to be distance ranges rather than exact distances because buoys 
in different locations vary in distance from shore. In this case, students might define “near-
shore” as 1 kilometer or less from the mainland shore, “medium distance from the shore” 
as 1–5 kilometers out, and “far from shore” as 5–10 kilometers out. What is important here 
is that students must define the categories they want to compare (just like “defining the 
forest’s edge,” mentioned earlier). Also, the independent variable “distance from shore” 
is ordinal-level because it is not a measure, but rather is one of three distance categories 
ordered from small to large (and note that these are not necessarily even distances from 
shore). Figure 4.2 shows three buoys that are 1 kilometer or less from shore, five that are 
1–5 kilometers out, and two that are 5–10 kilometers out. Each buoy would have wind-
speed measurements associated with it. The data-table design for ordinal-level data is like 
that for nominal-level data, except that (a) whereas for a nominal-level study, the data 
are in different categories (for example, cats and dogs as two categories of animal), for an 
ordinal-level study, the data are all in the same category (for example, cats of different rela-
tive size); and (b) the columns are ordered, usually increasing from left to right. 
Using the buoy-distance example and map in Figure 4.2, Table 4.2 (p. 50) can be con-
structed by measuring the distances using the scale on the map and recording them in the 
three distance categories. The data in Table 4.2 address the research question, “What is the 
relationship between distance from shore and height of the waves so we can determine 
where it is safe to go sailing in a small boat?” To do this, we had to determine where

we wanted to see this relationship (we chose the Seattle area as a hypothetical example), 
whether we would use ranges of distance (we did use ranges), and whether we would 
use measures for one specific time or for a mean of the range of wave heights for a time 
period (we used the mean). We used mean wave heights, so we could demonstrate the use 
of another table (Table 4.3) to list and calculate the mean of the many samples from a time 
period to then put into Table 4.2. We chose mean wave height rather than wave height at 
a specific time because of the research question we were addressing. In this instance, our 
research question was related to sailing in a small boat, which takes place over a range of 
time. We calculated the mean for the wave heights over the period from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 
p.m., the dawn-to-dusk time during which someone might go sailing.
When looking at Table 4.2, note these aspects:
•	
The three distance categories are listed in increasing order from left to right.
•	
Each distance category has a different number of buoys. This influences how one 
discusses the conclusions that can be drawn about mean wave height because when 
there are more sampling locations, you can be more certain about the mean calculated 
from them. In this case, then, we can be more certain about the mean wave height a 
medium distance from shore than about the mean wave height far from shore.
The mean values for each buoy sample in Table 4.2 were calculated from the raw data of 
wave heights recorded at each hour from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Table 4.3 lists some of these raw

data, and then presents the mean of the raw data 
for each buoy sample at each location. Table  4.2 
lists these mean values again, and then their mean, 
for each location, which allows the research ques-
tion to be addressed.
In science, ordinal-level data are often repre-
sented using a line graph in which a line joins the 
mean values of each category. In analyses, users 
usually can obtain more information from a line 
graph than from a bar graph. In some cases, how-
ever, this type of data is depicted in a bar graph 
(we will discuss this exception below). The com-
mon way to graph ordinal-level data is shown in  
Figure  4.3, which was generated using the data 
from Table 4.2. Note that in the line graph, the mean 
wave heights were plotted and joined by a line.

From the graph type in Figure 4.3, a student typically might conclude that mean wave 
height nearshore is less than that at buoys farther offshore; however, as with the earlier 
bar graph for nominal-level data, having some idea of the data scatter around each of the 
means helps in drawing a stronger conclusion. Again, in real-world science, graphs often 
show measures of data scatter (for example, error bars that represent standard deviation). 
If, for instance, the data scatter around the means was large for both the nearshore and the 
medium-distance buoys, then we might be able to conclude that mean wave height was 
greater far from shore than it was a medium distance from shore and nearshore, but we 
could not conclude that the medium-distance and nearshore buoys were different.
The graph in Figure 4.4 illustrates scattering, or variation, of data and how it affects inter-
pretation of data in bar graphs and line graphs. The graph shows data for six buoys at which 
wave heights were determined at one point in the morning and at one point in the afternoon. 
Mean wave height is shown by the bars; the points represent individual recordings.
Each point on the graphs represent a single wave-height measurement; i.e. the raw data. 
In A, the data points from the morning are spread out evenly and reasonably tightly around 
the mean (the bar) in the morning, but the data points from the afternoon are very spread 
out. We could interpret this as showing that, although the mean of wave heights recorded in 
the morning was less than that of wave heights recorded in the afternoon, this difference was 
not true of some individual waves. In contrast, in B, the data points show that the heights of 
all the individual waves were consistently higher in the afternoon than in the morning, such 
that none of the data points in the two bars overlapped in their range. From this, we could 
conclude from B that the mean wave height recorded by buoys in the afternoon was greater 
than the mean height of waves recorded in the morning, and that this trend was consistent 
among all the individual waves measured. Therefore, B provides stronger evidence to claim 
a relationship between wave height and the time of day than A does, because the data in A 
show exceptions to the claim, as seen by the overlap of the data ranges. (As noted above, this 
interpretation of the scatter also can be applied to line graphs.)

However, as mentioned earlier, there are exceptions to the use of the line graph for ordi-
nal data. In some science disciplines, a bar graph is used to depict the relationship between 
the ordered categories. We encourage you to have your students use the standard practices 
of whatever science discipline they are working in, although we think that for depicting 
ordinal-level data, the line-graph approach provides more information in how it shows the 
differences between the means; with a sloping line between the data points.
Interval–Ratio (Measured) Variable
The final type of variable is the interval–ratio variable, 
also known as a measured variable. This is the highest-
order variable type, because complex interpretations 
can be done from measured variables (we will give an 
example later in this section. Data of this type must be 
proportional. For example, two times a 10 km/h wind 
speed is 20 km/h, and three times a 20 km/h wind speed 
is 60 km/h, which is six times the 10 km/h (two times 
multiplied by three times equals six times). Another way 
of thinking about it is that the differences are identical, for 
example, wind speed going from 10 km/h to 20 km/h is 
the same amount of change as going from 100 km/h to 
110 km/h. Notice how this is different from the coffee 
cup example, where the difference in volume between 
a small and medium cup is not necessarily the same as 
between a large and an extra-large. Interval–ratio vari-
ables are consistently proportional; they also are the most 
frequent form of variable used in science because they 
provide the most information for making predictions 
that can be further tested. We are also quite used to this 
type of data. The everyday measures we use—volume, 
mass, speed, temperature—are all interval–ratio vari-
ables, whether they are given in metric or U.S. customary 
units of measurement.
Interval–ratio data require a slightly different table 
design. This type of data variable compares a measured 
value (the independent variable) to a measured value 
(the dependent variable), so it is composed of pairs of 
numbers. For instance, comparing the mean arm length 
to the mean leg length of students in a seventh-grade class would be an interval–ratio 
study. We also can use interval–ratio data with our study of wave height versus distance 
from shore to understand that relationship differently, by using the measured distances at 
OUTLIERS
Earlier, we discussed how 
scientists often try to identify 
outliers at the data-entry 
stage by looking for data-
entry and data-collection 
errors, but they also look 
for outliers when analyzing 
graphical representations of 
the data because sometimes 
circumstances can cause a 
valid but aberrant data point. 
In this case, we recognized 
the data pair for Buoy 6 (see 
Table 4.4, p. 54) as an outlier 
because of the buoy’s location, 
which situated it in a different 
wind environment from the 
other buoys. The data pair was 
excluded from the calculation 
because such outliers would 
skew the results from analysis 
of the research question “What 
is the relationship between 
distance from shore and the 
mean wave height?”

each buoy rather than categories of distance (ordinal data), as we did in the ordinal data 
analysis example.
To do this, we use the mean wave height (for each hour from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) 
and the measured distance from the shore for each specific buoy on the map (Figure 4.2, 
p. 49). Note that data such as measured distances will not necessarily be provided directly  
by a data source, and in this case, the distance of each buoy from shore was determined by 
using a ruler to measure the distance on the map and converting that measurement to a 
real distance using the map scale. The determined distance for each buoy then is recorded 
in an x-y table (Table 4.4, column 1). In essence, at times, students might have to create data  
such as these, using graphical information such as maps provided with the real-time  
data set downloaded from the source.

Each “Buoy Number” (Table 4.4, column 1) refers to a specific buoy on the map (Figure 4.2), 
and the table shows the distance from shore for that buoy and the mean wave height. To 
reiterate, the distances from the shore in this table were measured on the map using a ruler 
and the scale provided on the map; they would not necessarily be provided directly as measure-
ments from a website itself. This is an example of the type of data that a student would have 
to create from the information provided at the real-time data set website.
When you examine the data set in the table, notice that one pair of numbers (Buoy 6) 
seems “off,” that is, it is a great distance from shore but has a very low mean wave height.

Because of that, this number pair is an outlier; however, in this case, it does not appear to 
represent a data error, but rather varies greatly from the overall data pattern because of 
how “distance from the mainland shore” is defined for this study. As shown on the map 
(Figure 4.2, p. 49), Buoy 6 is in the lee of an island and therefore is protected from wind 
by the island. As a result, it has a lower mean wave height than other buoys of similar 
distance. Although the data point for Buoy 6 should remain in the data set and be plotted 
in relevant graphs, it should be excluded from analysis of the relationship between wave 
height and buoy distance from shore. Such data patterns are difficult to discern from a data 
table alone, so in science, we create a graphical representation.
Scatter plots are the type of graph usually used with interval–ratio data in science. In 
scatter plots, the raw data points are individually graphed and then often followed by 
some sort of averaging or “summarizing” of the patterns shown. This graph type is quite 
powerful in science because not only does it show you the data that has been collected, but 
it also allows you predict what might be measured in other circumstances; those predic-
tions can then be tested. Scatter plots allow the strength of the relationship between the 
variables to be determined easily, which allows one to draw better conclusions from the 
data and better understand their implications. In many science disciplines, this type of 
graph is the most commonly used, because of these characteristics.
Figure 4.5 is a scatter plot of the buoy data in Table 4.4. One way of summarizing data 
in a scatter plot is to calculate an average relationship between the data points, which is 
called a line of best fit. This approach is used for data that are not sequential, such as these

buoy wind-speed data points. (Some examples of sequential data include time measurements 
and dates, such as if wind speed at one buoy were recorded over a period of time and then 
graphed.) In this plot, notice that, in general, the farther offshore the buoys are, the higher 
the wave heights are. Except with the outlier Buoy 6 data pair at (3.1, 0.5), there is a reason-
ably strong relationship between distance from shore and wave height. We describe it as 
“reasonably strong,” because most of the values are reasonably close to the best-fit line. 
The outlier data pair was excluded in calculating this best-fit line.

Source: Bowen and Bartley 2014.
We can better understand the strength of the relationship between these two variables 
by examining four common data-scatter patterns encountered in scatter plots (Figure 4.6). 
As the figure shows, they vary (from left to right) from following a pattern quite tightly 
to having more and more variation, until there is no obvious pattern. In these representa-
tions, data that follow the pattern in A have a very strong relationship, whereas those in B 
and C have a progressively weaker (although still present) relationship. A weak relation-
ship might indicate that
•	
the outcome is being influenced by another variable not yet accounted for (given 
that an x-y graph only has two variables);
•	
controls were not effectively enacted; and/or
•	
there actually is variation in the variables being measured (often the case in biology).
The pattern in D is that of no pattern, which means there is no discernible relationship 
between the two variables on the x-y axes. Importantly, “no relationship” is still a research 
finding and you should still report it. Just to be clear: Not finding an expected relationship 
between variables is an acceptable research finding. One criticism of professional science 
is that it is difficult to get no-relationship papers published; however, students should be 
encouraged to write reports about their findings, even if they conclude that there is no 
pattern in their data.

There are many types of relationships between two interval–ratio variables that might 
be apparent on scatter plots, but most are like the three examples in Figure 4.7 (or some 
combination of them, such as a sigmoid shape, which is a combination of [B] and [C]). The 
pattern in the scatter plot of our current data analysis (Figure 4.5, p. 55) is a straight-line 
relationship, as shown in Figure 4.7 (A), and is the relationship described using the model 
formula y = mx + b. Two types of curved relationships are also common in nature, as shown 
in Figure 4.7 (B) and (C). These curved relationships between the x and y variables should 
also be discussed in the conclusions of a study (as students often tend to reject a curvilinear 
relationship as “no relationship” and therefore not discuss it).
Another relationship sometimes shown in x-y scatter plots is a cycle (Figure 4.8). Scatter 
plots of cycles usually have an x-axis showing increasing time and usually do not show a 
best-fit line through the data points. Such graphs 
often join the data points together in the order 
they were collected, which makes sense because 
the events the data points represent are related (for 
example, what happens at 8:00 a.m. is related to 
what happened at 6:00 a.m., when the previous 
piece of data was collected). They show cycling of 
data over a period of time, and both the variation 
around the overall cycle pattern (and changes in 
that variation) and the cycling of the pattern over 
time contribute to the conclusions drawn. Using a 
scatter plot to graph cycles is common in some sci-
ence disciplines. For example, in the atmospheric 
sciences, climatologists might track the mean daily 
temperature over many years at higher latitudes to investigate whether the seasonal cycle 
is changing over a long time period. If they were to find that the plot’s peaks become 
higher and its valleys lower, that would indicate a greater shifting between extremes.

HOW SCIENTISTS COMMUNICATE ABOUT THEIR 
DATA
So far, we have entered the data into tables, created graphs to show patterns in the data, 
identified those patterns, and noted the strength of the patterns by looking at the data scat-
ter. Now we will discuss how scientists talk—and write—about their findings. Scientists 
present their conclusions and ideas to the broader scientific community for evaluation 
by other scientists. Scientists use hedging language to communicate about their research, 
because scientific findings and claims are probabilistic in nature—they cannot be certain, 
but rather only are some degree of probable. 
HEDGING LANGUAGE
Because scientific findings are probabilistic in nature, 
scientists use hedging language to indicate the level of 
certainty of their results or ideas. Here are some examples of 
hedging words and phrases:
•	 Seems, tends, looks like, appears to be, could be
•	 Is certain, is sure, believes, thinks, doubts
•	 Indicates, suggests, assumes
•	 Will, will not, must, can, cannot, would, could, might
•	 Often, frequently, usually, typically, sometimes, 
occasionally
•	 Certainly, definitely, clearly, probably, likely, possibly, 
perhaps, conceivably
•	 Certain, definite, clear, probable, possible
•	 Certainty, probability, likelihood, assumption, possibility
Traditionally, schools have taught students to make claims that are often quite abso-
lute and deterministic. For example, students often make claims such as “A causes B” or 
“Dogs run faster than cats.” Using deterministic language is problematic, because it can 
influence how much evidence people believe is necessary to make a claim. Instead, you 
should encourage your students to use hedging language that indicates how certain they 
are about their results. By doing so, you are encouraging them to be more scientific in

their writing and helping them to develop a more probabilistic understanding of scientific 
claims. For instance, consider how these sentences have different meaning:
•	
Wind speed was higher closer to shore.
•	
Wind speed was usually higher closer to shore.
•	
Wind speed was often higher closer to shore.
•	
Wind speed was sometimes higher closer to shore.
Note that the first sentence makes wind speed sound as though it is always faster, and 
each subsequent sentence seems to indicate that wind speed being higher near the shore is 
less and less frequent.
EFFECT OF DETERMINISTIC LANGUAGE
The public often expects scientists to give definitive 
answers, and scientists are often reluctant to do so. Perhaps 
this expectation stems from people being taught to use 
deterministic, absolute language in schools when learning 
about science. Some researchers, including Mike, believe that 
teaching students to think about science deterministically 
places an unrealistic burden of proof on scientists that the 
scientists cannot meet. In addition, this deterministic baseline 
might influence politicians to want more proof than science 
can provide before they act. It is easy to see how this dynamic 
might cause problems.
In addition to helping students understand the probabilistic nature of science, teaching 
them to write about their conclusions using hedging language also teaches them that hav-
ing perfect patterns among variables (that is, all data points being on the best-fit line) is 
not essential to be able to draw conclusions about and discuss implications of the results in 
science.
We also encourage you to be careful about allowing students to make statements indi-
cating that the results of an investigation prove their hypothesis. Results can support or not 
support a hypothesis, but they cannot prove one. One of the fundamental principles of 
science is that all findings be falsifiable. Every investigation is fair game for repeating, and

different results in a subsequent investigation could support a different conclusion. Make 
sure your students are using the language of science when they write about their results.
EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL RULES FOR 
SUMMARIZING DATA
This section is applicable for some middle school science teachers and many high school 
science teachers, but probably is beyond what most elementary teachers will need in work-
ing with their students. It also involves a bit of math—so if you are not a “math person,” 
you might decide to skip it (although we hope you will read it).
One of the common ways to summarize data and make it easier to understand is to 
calculate a mean (average) and use that mean in the data tables. This chapter’s examples 
and tables have demonstrated the need in many instances to determine the mean of a large 
volume of real-time data to be able to easily discern patterns and trends in those data. 
Calculating arithmetic means—which show the “central tendency” or middle part of the 
value range— work for most variable types, but not for all types.
For some types of data, it is not scientifically correct to calculate an arithmetic mean, 
because the scales used to quantify the data are not linear. Some examples of these data 
types are logarithmic scales such as the pH, Richter scale, and decibel scale (sound), and 
empirical measures that produce ordinal data, such as the Beaufort scale for wind speed.
Log scales are multiples of a base. A simple logarithmic scale goes up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.; 
however, those sequential values actually represent 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and so 
forth (see Table 4.5). For ordinal (ordered-category) data, the differences between values 
are not necessarily equal. For either of these, calculating an arithmetic mean will not pro-
duce correct and meaningful numbers.
In many cases, the correct way to deal with 
these types of data is too complicated for middle 
school students and many high school students. 
In the interest of getting your students to under-
stand the big picture, as a teacher, you might 
decide to have students calculate an arithmetic 
mean even though it is technically the incorrect 
approach. For example, Mike has had middle 
level students calculate an arithmetic mean of 
pH values (when students have done multiple 
samples); however, he has also told those students that arithmetic means are not the cor-
rect way to do it, but that the right way was too complex for them to learn at that time.

Consider this simple example of the problem, using Table 4.5. Imagine that you col-
lected three data samples that were log-scaled: 1, 1, and 4. Their mean would be
(1 + 1 + 4)/3 = 6/3 = 2. 
If you translated that mean log value of 2 into its “real” value, it would be 100; however, 
if you calculated the mean using the real values in the first place, you would get
(10 + 10 + 10,000)/3 = 10,020/3 = 3,340.
That would be the “correct” answer to the calculation, but 3,340 is very different from 
the 100 obtained by calculating the mean of the log value. Clearly, the amount of error in 
the results when calculating the means of logs is quite large, and that is why you cannot 
calculate a useful mean from pH, decibel-level, and Richter-scale values, and the other 
similar types of variables. Scientists want their assessment of variables’ relationships to 
be as precise as possible, and so calculating means from logarithmic scale values is not 
considered acceptable scientific practice; however, as we noted earlier, as a teacher, you 
must decide whether that practice is an acceptable workaround for the interim by weigh-
ing what your students can do against what is correct practice and what you are trying to 
teach them. For example, in this example scenario, unless they had already learned about 
logarithms, Mike would instruct his middle school students to report a mean value of 2 
because the logarithmic conversions would be too advanced for them.
It is also incorrect to calculate means of ordinal data. For example, assume the cof-
fee shop in our earlier example named their coffee cup sizes 1, 2, and 3 instead of small, 
medium, and large. If they placed a supply order for three packages of size 2 cups, two 
packages of size 1, and four packages of size 3, then calculated the mean of those values, 
you would get 2.2. However, it would not make sense to say that the order was for a mean 
cup size 2.2, because a package of size 2.2 cups does not exist. In this instance, the correct 
“mean” for ordinal data is a median or “middle value”—and you would order the data as 
either
1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3
or
Small, Small, Medium, Medium, Medium, Large, Large, Large, Large
to represent the quantities and sizes of the cups, and then choose the middle value, which 
in this case is either “2” or “medium.” So, the “mean” package is of “medium” cups.
There are many types of ordinal-level variables, including scales used to measure wind 
force (Beaufort wind force scale), tornado strength (Fujita-Pearson and Enhanced Fujita

scales), and hurricane strength (Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale). So in this case, you 
have two ways of “averaging”; you could find the median of all the “categories” on the 
scale (as in the two examples above), or you could convert each “category””on the scale to 
the “middle” (median) wind speed of the range the category represents and, in that case, 
then calculate the mean of those median wind speeds in kilometers or miles per hour. 
Often, the method for this is to look up the scale values and the wind speeds associated 
with them (for example, online through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration) and enter each median value of the wind-speed range into the table for calculating 
the mean. For example, a Beaufort wind force scale reading of 7 represents wind speed of 
50 to 61 km/h. The median of this range—55 or 56, not the Beaufort number of 7—would 
be entered in the table for calculating a mean. If needed, that calculated mean wind speed 
can then be reconverted to the Beaufort number. Note that converting these ordinal scale 
values to real values, from which an arithmetic mean can be calculated, is far easier than 
converting logarithmic scale values to real values.
SUMMARY
Understanding different types of data helps students determine the best way to organize, 
graph, and analyze those data. The different types of data and their associated tables, 
graphs, and analysis notes covered in this chapter are summarized in Table 4.6.
When discussing data and their analysis, scientists usually use hedging language, 
because their findings are probabilistic. Nominal data are collected in categories that 
have no order and are organized in tables with each category as a column heading. Bar 
graphs typically are used to display nominal data. Nominal data typically are not pre-
dictive, because the data in each category are independent of one another. Ordinal data 
are collected in ordered categories (the categories have a direction) and are organized in 
tables that have each category as a column heading. Ordinal data categories are generally 
organized in a table from least to greatest or lowest to highest; this type of data is often dis-
played in a line graph and might provide some ability to predict values of new categories. 
Interval–ratio data are collected as measurements. Their data tables are organized as x-y 
pairs and graphed as scatter plots that, in many cases, have a line of best fit drawn on them 
and their slope described. When a best-fit line is not appropriate, the pattern (or cycle) of 
the data is described. Bowen and Bartley (2014) cover data analysis in much more detail, 
including statistical procedures.

INTRODUCTION
This is the section you have been waiting for! Here, we provide sample activities for 
more than two dozen real-time investigations in your classroom. Each activity includes 
teacher notes that provide information for three-dimensional learning (disciplinary core 
ideas [DCIs], science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts), as well as 
background and technology information, an explanation of the data, and suggestions for 
scaling the lesson up or down.
Each activity also has a student handout that generally was developed at Level 1 or 2 
of Tamir’s Levels of Inquiry (see Table 3.1, p. 28). In most activities, both the problems and 
the procedures are given. Teachers who want to boost the level of inquiry might choose to 
forego the worksheet and initiate investigations that require greater student involvement 
in identifying problems and/or developing procedures. The data notes include informa-
tion about the type of data, how to sample it, and what issues might need clarification. In 
addition, data enrichment exercises suggest other ways to explore the data.
The technology notes provide appropriate websites and apps (when available) from 
which to retrieve the data. We have attempted to use the most stable sources and to sug-
gest multiple app options. Generally, websites for government agencies are stable for long  
periods—some, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), have used the same internet domain for decades—
however, over time, some URLs are likely to change. Should that occur with a resource pro-
vided in our activities, a web search often can provide the site’s updated website link. Apps 
are much newer than internet domains in the world of technology; while you are using this 
book, newer, better apps might become available and some that we suggest here might be 
phased out. Again, a simple search through a browser can provide up-to-date resources.
Activities are grouped into chapters by the sphere of Earth they investigate: atmosphere, 
biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and celestial sphere. These are tied directly to the DCIs 
that are connected to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Although not every 
state has adopted or will adopt the NGSS, many of the DCIs are parallel to core ideas 
represented in state standards. The crosscutting concepts and science and engineering 
practices are not just integrated in NGSS, but are part of true three-dimensional learning 
as outlined in A Framework for K–12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and 
Core Ideas (NRC 2012). Although most of these investigations use multiple practices and 
concepts, we have narrowed the focus to one or two of each. We did this to emphasize the 
corresponding practices and concepts in the activities and analysis questions presented for 
students to address. For all websites, teachers should provide students with QR Codes for

easy website access. Every activity provides links to the online sources it uses, and at the 
end of each chapter there is a table with the QR Codes for those online activity resources. If 
you are using a website not included in this text, you can easily make QR Codes for it. Just 
do an internet search for “QR Code generator” and several websites will appear in your 
search results that will allow you to generate your own QR Codes.
As you review these activities, you will see other ways to address the investigations and 
use the data. Good! We want these activities to be starting points for conducting real-time 
investigations, and hope we have given you the tools in the preceding chapters to develop 
inquiry activities that are well suited to your curriculum and students.
AVOIDING ASSUMPTIONS
Before we move on, there are two instructional implications that merit discussion. Having 
taught students at all levels from kindergarten through high school, Donna has some insights 
to share about working with big data that will make it easier for students to understand 
those data. The first one is that real-time data investigations can be used with students as 
young as third grade, depending on the inves-
tigation and the data. In some cases, the same 
data can be used at different levels for differ-
ent purposes. At other times, you will need 
to filter the data or tailor the questions about 
a phenomenon to the level of your students. 
Regardless, let the purposes of your investiga-
tion drive your decisions about what data to 
use and how students should work with it.
Second, geography skills might also be an 
obstacle for your students when working with 
real-time data. Depending on the students, 
there might be significant gaps in their abil-
ity to locate events on a map and/or in their 
general understanding of the location where 
the data were produced. Although latitude 
and longitude are often introduced in elemen-
tary social studies, with mastery expected in 
middle school, many high school students 
struggle with this skill. Maps deal with infor-
mation that is very abstract, for example, large 
distances; places students have never been; 
and information from within Earth, where 
even pictures provide little useful context.
MAPS AS ABSTRACTIONS
To help students deal with the 
abstract nature of maps, consider 
having them construct a to-scale 
map of a small local park or of the 
school grounds or even part of the 
school building. You will notice that 
in their maps, students leave blank 
areas, that is, areas with no content. 
You can engage students in talking 
about these blank areas, transition 
zones (outside), and other map-
related issues. That conversation 
and problem solving, that is, the 
work of getting the map right, will 
give students understanding and 
context for thinking about and 
discussing maps they will use for 
activities in this book and elsewhere.

Whether you are discussing photoperiods at different latitudes; radiosonde data over 
Little Rock, Arkansas; ocean acidification in Grey’s Reef; or plate tectonics off the coast of 
Australia, it helps to have a globe and a map handy. When possible, use local data. When 
you are not using local data, be sure to point out the location where data were generated 
and to discuss its relative location, using maps and a globe. Spend a minute reviewing 
how to find latitude and longitude on a map and choose a map projection that is easy for 
students to use. Sharing relevant news articles also engages your students and helps them 
see that the data they are using are current and are happening in real time and in real loca-
tions. This type of application integrates concepts across disciplines and engages students 
in authentic learning experiences.
USING GATHERED RESOURCES IN THE 
CLASSROOM
Data from government-funded research are public (in the public domain) and are not pro-

INVESTIGATIONS USING  
REAL-TIME ATMOSPHERE DATA
R
eal-time atmosphere data covers a broad range of phenomena, including weather, 
air quality, ozone, climate, and more. Weather data are collected by satellites, radar, 
ground-level instruments, and radiosondes (instruments attached to weather bal-
loons that collect and transmit data about atmospheric conditions).
Real-time weather data are probably the most familiar. Long before “the internet” was 
a household term, weather data were reported in near real time in daily newspapers, on 
the radio, and on television news. Today, available weather data are much more compre-
hensive, and can easily be obtained for any city in any country, including past observa-
tions and predicted conditions. Public sources of atmospheric data include the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), NASA, and the National Weather Service (NWS). Other sources include the 
American Meteorological Society (AMS) and other nonprofit organizations, The Weather 
Channel, public and private colleges and universities, and private corporations.
Below, we share some of the most useful sources through which weather data that are 
accessible; in addition, Tables 5.1 and 5.2 (pp. 108 and 109, respectively) list all digital 
resources used in the chapter. Then, the rest of the chapter contains sample activities. You 
might want to use these activities as-is or modify them to fit your instructional purposes 
and students’ ability levels. You might also find that our suggestions for using the data will 
trigger ideas for other investigations with those data.
The primary source of weather data is the NWS (www.weather.gov), whose website pro-
vides data for current conditions, including cloud cover, temperature, wind speed, wind 
direction, air pressure, and dew point. On their site, you will also find weather maps show-
ing current conditions, locations of fronts, and predicted climate trends. In addition, past and 
predicted data are available there in multiple formats—text, charts, maps, tables, and graphs.
The NWS provides predictions in meteogram format (Figure 5.1, p. 72). Meteograms are 
a graphical model of weather and are used to analyze hourly data over a short period of 
time. One way to use a predictive meteogram is to have students use current weather maps 
to explain what factors might be influencing a forecast. For example, if students know that 
mid-latitude weather comes from the west, can they develop an argument that supports the 
predicted weather trends? Another possible activity would be for students to compare the

weather outlook with actual weather data, and to assess whether temperatures rose and fell 
as expected, whether predicted precipitation arrived, and how accurate the outlook was.

One of Donna’s favorite websites for real-time weather data is DataStreme from the AMS 
(www.ametsoc.org/amsedu/dstreme). The DataStreme site was developed for use with a con-
tinuing education meteorology course for teachers, sponsored by the AMS. In addition to 
the meteorology course, they also have continuing education courses about oceans and 
about climate. The DataStreme site includes data provided for teachers enrolled in their 
course, but Donna has used it with middle and high school students. Their maps with 
surface data can be used to create isotherms or isobars (bands of equal temperature or 
equal pressure, respectively) and to explore wind patterns. Blank charts are available for 
students to create their own Stüve diagrams illustrating the vertical atmospheric tempera-
ture profile, or to create meteograms using NOAA data. In addition, educational materials 
are available from the DataStreme website and if you are interested, you might want to 
explore some of their continuing education courses for teachers.
If climate data are what you need, then NOAA is the most comprehensive source for 
long-term climate trends. One of its divisions, the National Climate Center (www.climate.gov), 
provides data on historical temperature, precipitation, drought, snow cover, carbon dioxide 
(CO2) concentrations, solar energy output, and more. Using their Global Climate Dashboard

(Figure 5.2), students can compare current data to overall trends and construct arguments 
that support or refute claims about the possible variables influencing climate change.
The NOAA Environmental Visualization Laboratory (www.nnvl.noaa.gov) is a rich source 
of atmospheric data for clouds, wind currents, stratospheric ozone, snow cover, and more, 
provided in graphic and animated formats. NOAA also provides real-time data on space 
weather (www.swpc.noaa.gov), which affects our atmosphere in multiple ways. For example, 
magnetic storms on the Sun interact with Earth’s upper atmosphere to generate beautiful 
auroras, and long-term trends in the sunspot cycle have correlations with climate variations.
Air quality information is important in any environmental study of our atmosphere. 
The AIRNow website (www.airnow.gov) provides air-quality data hourly that includes tro-
pospheric ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). The EPA website (www.epa.gov/
air-data) provides daily concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 
sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), and other pollutants. Student 
investigations can connect weather patterns to air quality, seasonal variations, and popula-
tion, and can compare urban and rural areas. Want to know what the sources of air pol-
lution are your area? The EPA website provides information about specific pollutants on 
their Where You Live page (www3.epa.gov/air/emissions/where.htm).
Webcams cannot be overlooked as a source of real-time data for weather. The NWS 
has webcams in many locations that students can use to correlate weather variables, such 
as cloud cover and air pressure data. Traffic, school, and other webcams can also help

Background 
Information
Tropospheric ozone is a gas that occurs naturally in the atmosphere in 
small amounts. It is also produced by photochemical reactions when 
sunlight interacts with pollutants such as nitrous oxides (NOx), carbon 
monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by 
automobiles, industry, and other human activities. High levels of ozone 
in the troposphere present a health risk to humans and other organisms. 
In people, respiratory problems are more likely to occur when ozone 
levels are elevated, which can be especially problematic for people with 
asthma. Because sunlight and heat increase ozone formation, ozone 
levels are often higher in summer than in winter. Also, because it is 
formed from pollutants such as CO, NOx, and VOCs, ozone levels are 
usually higher in high-population areas than in rural areas.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
Although there are dozens of apps that provide current air-quality data, 
the authors found no apps that provide historical data. The EPA AIRNow 
app provides current data. To find historical data, students should access 
the EPA AIRNow website through a browser on a computer or their 
device. This should not present much of a problem, because the data are 
easy to access through the website.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: You might need to help students determine how to sample 
fairly. For instance, students might pick a particular day of the month to 
sample at a particular time or if there are multiple measures each day, they 
might calculate the mean (average) temperature for the day.
Data Type: Temperature and ozone level are interval–ratio (measured) 
types of data.
Data Issues: More-astute students might notice that the months being 
different lengths could cause minor data variation on the horizontal axis. 
One solution to this is to divide the number of days in a year by 12 and 
then measure at the same point in each of those periods. This will result 
in 12 evenly spaced measures; note they will be on different dates of each 
calendar month.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
Ozone levels are reported using an air quality index (AQI) that corresponds 
to actual ozone levels. The EPA AQI of 100 represents ozone levels of 
0.075 parts per million (ppm) averaged over an 8-hour period. Levels of 
0.070 ppm are considered the standard for EPA regulations. Students will 
need to understand that the method of data sampling will present outliers, 
because air quality is also affected by weather conditions such as wind, 
sky cover, and precipitation, which affect the availability of pollutants and/
or the amount of sunlight available for photochemical reactions.
Scaling Down
Use a jigsaw activity by having students work in pairs, with each pair 
collecting one data point and sharing with the class. You can also use 
an app and track data over long periods of time, starting early in the 
year. Have students collect daily data and record it on a class weather 
calendar to correlate temperature and ozone only, without comparing it 
to less-populated areas. By the end of a full semester, the amount of data 
collected will be sufficient for analysis.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Scaling Up
Have students collect other weather data, such as precipitation or wind 
speed. Then, they can compare data from sunny dates to data from rainy 
dates as an additional variable in producing photochemical ozone, or 
explore the role of wind in reducing pollutants. Students can also collect 
data related to population density for urban areas.
Extending
Ozone Monitoring: Students in urban areas can use ozone test strips to 
monitor ozone levels near their school.
Ozone Up High: If it is the same molecule, why is ozone considered 
bad low in the atmosphere but good when up high in the atmosphere? 
Students can investigate stratospheric ozone using the NASA app Earth 
Now, and compare stratosphere and troposphere ozone levels.
Enrichment Using Data: Have students construct a meteogram for 
temperature and ozone level (with the time variable on the horizontal 
axis) to examine variation over the year.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Although ozone levels vary seasonally, they will be higher in the summer than at other times 
of the year because of increased ultraviolet light levels. Generally, trend lines should show a 
greater correlation between ozone and temperature in urban areas than in rural ones.

In this activity, you will explore the relationship between tropospheric 
ozone and temperature, as well as the effect of human activity on air 
quality.
Technology 
Notes
•	 Collect air-quality data from the EPA AIRNow website (www.airnow.
gov).
•	 Retrieve climate data from the Weather History Explorer app or the 
Weather Underground website (www.wunderground.com/history).
Orientation 
Questions
•	 Why are air-quality alerts more common in the summer than in the 
winter?
•	 Why are urban areas (cities) more likely than rural areas to have 
air-quality alerts?
•	 How do urban populations affect air quality?
Directions

Background 
Information
The Goddard Institute for Space Science (GISS) Surface Temperature 
Analysis project (GISTEMP) monitors surface temperatures across the 
globe and publishes those data in a variety of ways. They offer access 
to over 135 years of data by month and region. In this activity, students 
will examine the mean surface temperature in three different regions of 
the globe—northern latitudes, middle latitudes, and southern latitudes. 
Students will explore the data set to determine differences in climate 
changes over time in these regions. Then, they will attempt to explain these 
differences, for example, decreased ice cover in the Arctic resulting in less 
sunlight being reflected and increased warming.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: The GISTEMP project data set is very large, containing 
over 135 years’ worth of data for multiple regions of Earth. If students do 
not have access to a graphing tool, you will need to help them select a 
sampling technique that will yield a manageable data set.
Data Type: The data used in this activity are the interval–ratio (measured) 
data type, graphed in a scatter plot, with time in years on the x-axis. In 
this type of graph, the data are often joined point to point.
Data Issues: Students might be confused by the temperature data 
displayed in the table. The data represent the amount above or below the 
mean global temperature, which is estimated to be 14°C (57°F), derived 
using temperature data for the years 1951 to 1980. The multiplier for the 
data is 0.01 and the unit is °C.
Enrichment Using Data: Have students use the monthly northern and 
southern hemisphere data to determine whether there is a seasonal 
pattern for climate change.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
It might be helpful for students to have an understanding of global 
climate change. Students should have some idea that large bodies of 
water change temperature more slowly than land does. Use a jigsaw 
activity to help students more efficiently process data. Divide the class 
into initial groups of three. Assign each person in the initial groups a letter: 
A, B, or C. Now, have the students gather in different groups by letter to 
create graphs. Group A should graph the northern latitudes; Group B, the 
middle latitudes; and group C, the lower latitudes. When the graphs are 
completed, students return to their initial groups to compare graphs.
Scaling Down
Simplify this activity by using only the data for the Northern and 
Southern Hemispheres, instead of using data for the three latitude bands.
Scaling Up
Have students examine all eight latitude bands instead of just three. 
How might the differences in climate change in different regions affect 
ecosystems in those regions?
Extending
Have students conduct background research to explain the differences 
that they see in impacts of climate change across different latitude 
bands.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Regardless of which data set is used, trends will show an increase in mean temperatures. 
The Southern Hemisphere will show less change than the Northern Hemisphere.

TEACHER NOTES: EXTREME WEATHER
Learning Goal
Students will use a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) database to identify extreme weather events throughout the 
United States in different locations or over time.
Disciplinary 
Core Ideas
•	 Earth’s systems
•	 Weather and climate
Science and 
Engineering 
Practices
•	 Analyzing and interpreting data
•	 Using mathematics and computational thinking

Concepts
•	 Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation
•	 Patterns
Background 
Information
The NOAA Storm Events Database contains records of significant 
weather events that have occurred in the United States since 1950. 
Significant weather events include severe weather (dangerous 
meteorological phenomena that cause significant property damage, 
injury and/or death, and/or social and business disruption) and extreme 
weather (weather events extremely unusual for a given area, for example, 
snow in San Diego). NOAA attempts to format and standardize event 
data. Event data are recorded geographically by county and state.
DATA AND TECHNOLOGY

No appropriate apps were located for this activity. 
Technology 
Notes
The Storm Events Database does not have a responsive design, so 
students might find it a challenging to view on small devices. Students 
can use the database to explore multiple types of events (for example, 
hail, tornado, heavy precipitation, dense fog, extreme heat or cold) 
nationwide, by state, or for a specific county within a state. Each event 
describes the date, location, magnitude, and damage (property, death, 
injury). The database search function only returns 500 data points per 
search, so students will need to pay attention to how they sample and 
collect data.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: The NOAA Storm Events Database is huge. It contains 
tens of thousands of storm events that have occurred throughout the 
United States over more than 60 years. A variety of information is 
collected for each storm event. As a result, students will need to give 
careful consideration to how they constrain their data sampling.
Data Type: The database contains all three types of data: Nominal, 
ordinal, and interval–ratio.
Data Issues: Students might need to revise their sample size or conduct 
multiple searches to acquire the data they need to answer their 
investigation question. The NOAA Storm Events Database only displays 
500 weather events for each search.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
•	 This activity is designed to allow students significant freedom in their 
exploration (Tamir, Level 3; see Table 3.1, p. 28). Students will be able to 
explore the data set, determine a question to guide their investigation, 
define the data sample to collect, and analyze their data.
•	 Student investigations will focus on comparing weather events in 
different regions within the same time frame, or over time in the same 
region.
Scaling Down
Students who do not have experience creating their own investigation 
questions will need support in this activity. One possible support would 
be for students to generate questions individually or in small groups and 
then publicly share those questions with the class. Students could then 
use one of their own questions or select an interesting question shared 
by another student.
Scaling Up
The complexity of the activity can be increased by challenging students 
to look at larger samples of data.
Extending
Enrichment Using Data: The open-ended nature of this activity should 
provide plenty of opportunities for student enrichment.
SAMPLE INVESTIGATION QUESTIONS
The NOAA Storm Events Database provides an opportunity for students to craft many 
unique questions. The process described in the student handout will give them a sense of 
what is possible, but they may need support crafting and revising their question. A good 
question provides guidance for how students will sample data. Some sample questions are 
as follows:
•	 Have the number of tornados per year in Oklahoma increased over the past 20 years?
•	 Have the number of extreme heat days per year in Nevada increased over the past 
50 years?

SAMPLE INVESTIGATION QUESTIONS (continued)
•	 Have the number of deaths from extreme heat in the United States increased or 
decreased over the past 30 years?
•	 Over the past 20 years in Wisconsin, which month has experienced the most heavy-
precipitation days (rain and/or snow)?
•	 Over the past five years, which has caused more property damage, tornados, or floods?
•	 Over the past five years, which county in Illinois has had the most floods?
•	 Has there been an increase in heavy snow events in Massachusetts over the past 
30 years?
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Because this activity is designed as an open-ended investigation, the data produced 
can vary widely. Assessment should be based on student interpretation of data and 
presentation of their research project.

STUDENT HANDOUT: EXTREME WEATHER
Activity Goal
In this activity, you will design an investigation to determine whether 
there are patterns in extreme weather events.
Technology 
Notes
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm 
Events Database contains information about extreme weather events in 
the United States since January 1950. Data can be accessed at www.ncdc.
noaa.gov/stormevents.
Orientation 
Questions
What patterns (either location-based or over time) can you identify by 
using the NOAA Storm Events Database?
Directions
1.	 Begin by conducting a few searches using different criteria (location, 
type of weather, varying time ranges) to orient yourself to the type of 
data in the Storm Events Database.
2.	Complete the Investigation section, based on data available in the 
database. In general, investigation questions will compare weather 
events in different locations within the same time period or compare 
weather events in one location over a long time period.
Investigation
1.	 After conducting a variety of searches, list the types of data that you could compare 
(for example, time of year versus heavy snow event, change in the number of 
extreme heat days over time). Include at least five possible comparisons.
2.	Select the comparison you listed in question 1 that interests you the most. Think 
about how you will sample (select) data from the database for analysis. For example, 
if you are comparing weather events at two locations, what will the time period be? 
Or, if you are comparing changes in a weather event over time in one location, will 
you use data for 20 years, 30 years, or longer?
3.	Write your investigation question. It should provide information about the location, 
weather event or other information, and the time period for the data sample that 
you will use.

4.	Draw a data table to use to collect your data. Before collecting data, have your teacher 
approve your responses to questions 3 and 4.
5.	Collect your data and display them in a graph.
6.	From the data you collected, what claim (that is, what answer to your investigation 
question) can you make? How is this claim supported by evidence from your data? What 
might be the cause of the patterns that you found?
7.	 Create a poster that includes your investigation question, data table, graph(s), and

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
The NWS website has a responsive design and can be used easily on 
small devices. All data are presented in text form (see the website 
screenshot above). The Storm and Weather Underground apps show 
wind direction as pointers on a 360° compass to make it easier for 
students to identify wind direction. If you are using these apps, have the 
students open the app settings and change the units for air pressure from 
inches to millibars so that they will be using scientific units rather than 
U.S. customary ones.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: No sampling problems anticipated.
Data Type: Wind direction, wind speed, temperature, and air pressure are 
all the interval–ratio data type.
Data Issues: No data issues anticipated.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
Before conducting this investigation, students should have an 
understanding how weather data are collected and what they mean. They 
should understand the difference between temperature and dew point. 
Students must also understand the difference between high and low air 
pressure, how air pressure is measured (millibars rather than inches). In 
addition, they should understand that air pressure data values omit the 
leading “9” or “10” and are extended to one decimal place.
Scaling Down
You can simplify this activity by having each student collect data from 
one location and contribute it to a class map for discussion and analysis, 
rather than producing individual maps.
Scaling Up
Make this investigation more complex by increasing the number of 
locations for which models are provided so that there is one model per 
state.
Another option to increase complexity is to have students draw either 
isobars or isotherms on their maps based on the data collected.
Extending
Weather Channel News: Students can use the maps they create to 
produce weather report videos explaining the current weather conditions 
around the country and in specific cities.
Go International!: Students can collect and analyze data for locations 
worldwide using the website http://weather.org.
Station Model Journals: Have students keep a station model journal for 
the weather in a specific location for a week. Then they can describe the 
changes that occur over time.

(continued)
Enrichment Using Data: Have students use the station models to identify 
areas of high pressure and low pressure, predict a weather track (that is, 
how those highs and lows will move), and then create station models on 
subsequent days along the tracks to observe the changes.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
In general, low pressure is associated with cloudy skies and high pressure with clear skies. 
Students should see patterns emerge, such as counterclockwise winds around areas of low 
pressure or clockwise winds around areas of high pressure, and should be able to answer 
questions about current weather in specific locations based on data collected.

Background 
Information
Meteograms are graphical models of weather data produced for a single 
location over a 24-hour period. Although there might be some variation 
in how meteograms are produced, they usually present temperature, dew 
point, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, and air pressure data. 
Wind speed and wind direction can be shown using numeric data (knots 
and azimuth) or a station model symbol (
). The data are graphed from 
left to right in order of oldest to most recent. The models show changes 
in conditions and can reveal the effects of storms and fronts.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: Teachers need to help students determine geographic 
location and day for which they will collect their data.
Data Type: Temperature (often in °F), dew point (°F), wind speed (mph), 
precipitation (in.), and air pressure (millibars) are all the interval–ratio 
(measured) data type, and in a meteogram these are graphed against 
time (on the horizontal axis, another interval–ratio variable type), which 
is “sequential.” Temperature, dew point, and air pressure are shown as 
a line graph. Wind speed, cloud cover, and wind direction are shown 
using symbols (wind barbs) and precipitation is shown using symbols 
representing the precipitation type.
Data Issues: The value of the y-axis is determined individually for each 
data set, depending on the range of the data. 
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
This activity is most appropriately used at the end of a weather study 
unit because students should understand weather variables and know 
how to draw a station model. This is a two-part activity. First, students 
create a meteogram for a specific location using 24-hour data, and then 
they describe the changes that have occurred during that period. A very 
effective way to use this activity is to select cities where specific weather 
events have occurred during the past 24 hours. This allows students to 
see the effects from passage of cold fronts, land and sea breezes, storms, 
and more.
Scaling Down
Instead of having students create their own meteograms, have them 
locate and collect meteograms for specific cities from the DataStreme 
website (www.ametsoc.org/amsedu/dstreme/metgram.html). Then, have 
students construct explanations of how weather has changed in these 
locations. Teachers should provide sample meteograms that illustrate 
specific weather phenomena, such as the passing of a front.
Scaling Up
Ask students to identify cities in which a weather event has occurred over 
the past 24 hours and produce a meteogram to show the event. After 
they have interpreted their own data, students can trade meteograms 
with each other for interpretation. They should compare their 
explanations and construct arguments to defend their interpretations. 
In addition, students can compare meteograms for different cities 
experiencing the same phenomenon to see how different locations 
experience the same event.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Comparing Cities: Comparing data from different cities experiencing the 
same event could be useful to help students see changes that occur as a 
result of weather systems. 
Personalized Meteograms: Students can construct personalized 
meteograms with data they collect themselves over a period of hours or 
days.
Enrichment Using Data: In addition to the data already discussed, some 
meteograms could include humidity and visibility data.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
For passage of a cold front through a specific location, students should note that the air 
pressure drops and then rises again when the front has moved through. Winds will shift 
from out of the south and east ahead of a front to out of the west and north behind it. 
Temperatures will drop and skies will often begin to clear after front has passed.

Notes
For this activity, you will collect data from the National Weather Service 
(NWS) website at www.weather.gov or from a weather app suggested by 
your teacher.
Orientation 
Questions
How do local weather conditions change when a weather event occurs?
What relationships between air pressure, temperature, and wind speed 
and wind direction can be observed as the weather conditions change?
Directions
Identify a city in which, a specific weather event has occurred in the 
past 24 hours (for example, a storm, the passage of a cold front, or 
another event). Your teacher will direct you on whether to collect 
those data for a specific city or for a city of your own choosing.
1.	 Gather hourly data for that city for the past 24 hours from the NWS 
website.
2.	Construct and explain the meteogram.
a.	Graph the data for temperature, dew 
point, wind direction, wind speed, 
precipitation, and air pressure into the 
meteogram on the reverse side of this 
handout. You will need to set your own 
scale for temperature and pressure 
based on the data you have collected. 
Use line graphs for temperature, dew point, and air pressure. 
Use station models to show wind speed and wind direction. Use 
raindrops and snowflakes to show precipitation: one for light 
precipitation, two for moderate, and three for heavy. Use the equal 
sign (=) to indicate fog.
b.	Construct an explanation of the changes observed during the past 
24 hours.
3.	Complete the Analysis Questions, Conclusions, and Reflection 
Question sections.

Background 
Information
Wind direction affects how airplanes take off and land. Generally, aircraft 
will take off into the wind, because that has the effect of increasing the 
speed at which the wind passes over the wings. A strong headwind when 
landing provides resistance and helps slow the aircraft for a smoother 
landing. Although taking off and landing into the wind is preferable, 
the orientation of the airport landing strips influences the direction 
of landing. For example, larger airports often primarily use east–west 
landing strips, because north–south landing strips are not long enough 
for larger aircraft. Generally, knowing the direction flights take off and 
land can provide information about wind direction. This, in turn, can 
provide the location of high- and low-pressure systems. If you face the 
wind, low pressure will be to the right and high pressure to the left.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
The FlightAware website and app allow students to see flight traffic in 
real time. There are usually so many flights that, to see individual aircraft, 
you must zoom in. Students should look for the major airports (indicated 
by white lines) designated in the activity, and identify planes landing or 
taking off by clicking on the airplane graphic. To find wind information, 
students can use many different websites and apps; however, the 
Weather Underground website and app allow students to view the 
information in map form.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: No sampling issues are anticipated.
Data Type: Wind speed is an interval–ratio type of data. Wind direction 
is often recorded as a cardinal direction (for example, north, south) or 
an intercardinal direction (for example, northwest, southwest), but these 
wind directions might also be recorded in compass degrees.
Data Issues: Students might be familiar with only the coarser-grain 
cardinal and intercardinal directions and not with the finer-grain 
secondary-intercardinal directions (for example, south–southwest, west–
southwest). 
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
In this activity, students will make inferences about wind direction and 
the location of high- and low-pressure systems from the landing and 
take-off patterns at various airports. Before participating in this activity, 
students should understand that winds blow clockwise around high-
pressure systems and counter-clockwise around low-pressure systems in 
the Northern Hemisphere. Teachers might want to discuss how aircraft 
use the wind to assist in take-off and landing by flying into the wind 
when possible.
Scaling Down
Have students complete the investigation using landing and take-off 
paths to determine wind direction, without making conclusions about the 
location of high- and low-pressure systems.
Scaling Up
Have students predict the location of high- and low-pressure systems 
without verifying the wind direction for each airport. 
Airport runways are identified using numeric designations based on their 
compass setting (for example, runway 23 is at 230 degrees, runway 09 
is 90 degrees). Students can find the designation for each runway at 
the airports shown to determine how it might affect flight take-off and 
landing.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Comparing Aircraft Speed: Have students use the FlightAware website 
or app to find pairs of eastbound–westbound aircraft that are close in 
proximity. Ask students to compare the aircraft speed of the two aircraft 
and construct an explanation about why there is a significant difference. 
Additional information provided for each flight provides a rich source 
of data for students to analyze, for example, by calculating flight times, 
altitude, and airport traffic.
Enrichment Using Data: Have students convert the cardinal directions to 
polar measure (degrees) so they can calculate the “degrees incorrect” of 
their predictions. These could also have a +ve or –ve component (that is, 
over or under the actual, respectively). 
ASSESSMENT NOTES
There will not always be an observable pattern tied to current high- and low-pressure 
systems because airports generally only have two runways, often running generally east–
west and north–south. Smaller airports might only have one. For this reason, expect some 
variation in the data and discuss reasons for the outliers with students.

STUDENT HANDOUT: WIND BENEATH OUR WINGS
Activity Goal
In this activity, you will use the flight patterns of aircraft to gather 
information about current weather conditions and to predict the locations 
of pressure systems. Pilots take off and land into the wind to use wind 
speed to their advantage. By observing aircraft landing and taking off 
patterns, you can make inferences about wind direction. Wind direction will 
tell you the approximate location of high- and low-pressure systems. 
Technology 
Notes
To find flight data, use the FlightAware app or website (https://
flightaware.com/live). Wind-direction data can be obtained from the 
Weather Underground app or website (www.wunderground.com). 
Orientation 
Questions
•	 What inferences can you make about wind direction based on the 
take-off and landing patterns of aircraft?
•	 What information does wind direction provide about the location of 
high- and low-pressure systems? 
Directions
Part 1—Data Table
1.	 For each airport in the data table, identify one aircraft approaching or 
departing the airport. Click on the plane to verify its flight path.
2.	Record the flight information and direction in which the plane is 
moving in the data table. 
3.	Find two additional cities of your choosing and do the same.
4.	Based on the direction at which each plane is landing, predict the 
direction from which the wind is blowing. Record your prediction in the 
data table.
5.	Using the Weather Underground website link or app, locate each city. 
Record in the data table the direction from which the wind is actually 
blowing. 
Part 2—Map
6.	Indicate the wind direction at each location on the map.
7.	 Once you know the wind direction at all of the airports, predict the 
location of high-pressure and low-pressure areas in the continental 
United States. Indicate your predictions on the map.
8.	Go back to the Weather Underground website or app and select 
“Current Conditions” map. Compare the predicted locations of high-

INVESTIGATIONS USING  
REAL-TIME BIOSPHERE DATA
T
he biosphere is the part of Earth that is composed of living organisms. This includes 
humans, ducks, grass, trees, snails, algae … well, you get it. Data on animals, insects, 
and other life forms are often collected by researchers studying their behavior. Envi-
ronmental scientists study the environment and how organisms interact with it. Informa-
tion about people is often collected by governments and population researchers. Data can 
be collected using digital instruments, cameras, surveys, and even simply by observation.
Human populations—a topic in every environmental science course—can be explored 
in great detail at the U.S. Census Bureau website (www.census.gov/topics/population.html). 
Interactive maps are one way that population trends can be explored with real-time data. 
The NASA Earth Observations (NEO) website (http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov) provides real-
time data for several Earth systems. The data sets in the site’s “Life” category are graphic 
models—monthly maps that provide information about net primary productivity, leaf 
area, chlorophyll concentration, and several other research topics. The National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Integrated Ocean Observing System Animal 
Telemetry Network (IOOS ATN) website (http://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/ATN) allows track-
ing of marine animals. Web cameras at zoos, nature conservatories, and other locations 
can provide a way for students to do population studies or watch interactions between 
organisms and their ecosystems. There are osprey cams, bee cams, fall-foliage cams, and 
even naked mole rat cams. These provide a rich source of data that help students to better 
understand how specific species function in their environment.
One useful investigation through which to explore how life interacts with the environ-
ment would be to correlate current sea-surface temperature to past and present movement 
of marine animals using the IOOS ATN website. Figure 6.1 (p. 112) contains screenshots 
of site content showing the movement of a tagged salmon shark over a six-month period 
in 2015. On the site, students can watch the movement of specific marine animals over a 
number of days or compare the most recent location of different species. Students also can 
use site information to infer the preferred conditions of different species and compare their 
inferences to information learned through environmental studies research.

Land use is a topic studied in every environmental science course. The U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) website (www.nrcs.usda.gov) provides data on land use and soil resources. 
A possible investigation using the USDA data would be to compare and contrast land-use 
trends for different states. For example, Figure 6.2 shows the latest data for land use for  
Montana and New Jersey. These two states are very different in many ways, including 
geography and population density. New Jersey has a population density of 1,210 people per 
square mile, whereas Montana’s population density is seven people per square mile. You 
could ask students to investigate how land use in these states has changed over time, and to 
develop an explanation about why there are so many differences in land use in these states. 
How do weather and climate affect each’s use of land? What other variables contribute to the 
differences shown?
Again, the investigations that follow are only a few of the many ideas that you could 
use to explore the biosphere. Use these as a starting point … and see what new ideas you 
generate with the real-time resources that are available. Tables 6.1 and 6.2 (pp. 138 and 139, 
respectively), list all digital resources used in this chapter.

can engage, and how those might be affected by factors such as weather 
conditions or time.

Background 
Information
Understanding issues of environmental science involves understanding 
how animals behave in their environmental settings and how abiotic 
features (for example, temperature, rainfall, wind, light, and humidity) 
might influence those behaviors. Scientists often construct behavioral 
descriptions (called ethograms) in relation to abiotic features to 
understand any links between those features and exhibited behaviors of 
the animals. There are many private, government, and university websites 
that show live video of animals “behaving” in their environment that 
could be used to help students understand the relationship between 
abiotic factors and the animals in a video.

at a specific time; therefore, it is better to have students conduct this 
activity on their own time (for example, at lunch, after school, at home, 
on weekends) so they can check back at different times to see how the 
animals are behaving.

INVESTIGATIONS USING REAL-TIME BIOSPHERE DATA
DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: The complexity of data sampling depends on how 
active the animal is and whether the site shows one or two animals (for 
example, birds sitting on a nest) or many animals (for example, a herd at 
a watering hole in Africa).
Data Type: If behavior frequencies are recorded over several days (or 
other periods of time), they would be interval–ratio data (but represented 
in a bar graph with time on the x-axis).
Data Issues: Students are engaging in counts and lists of behavior to 
determine frequency and other data. If the counts occur at the same 
time each day, a bar graph can be used to compare data for the different 
days—clustering bars either by day (so that each group of bars has the 
frequencies of all of the behaviors) or by behavior (so that each group of 
bars has the data from all of the days); it would probably be best to show 
students examples of each.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
To do this activity, students need to understand what an ethogram is. 
Basically, an ethogram is the animal-behavior equivalent of a classroom-
behavior checklist. In this activity, students will be asked to choose an 
animal that is being live-streamed and observe its behavior for 5–10 
minutes. As they observe, students should note any repetitive patterns, 
and then define or describe those in writing and enter a descriptor 
for them in the table on the back of their activity page. The camera 
feeds provide some physical environmental information (for example, 
temperature) when it first starts (see the Explore screenshot above) and 
allows students to digitally capture an image for their report, if they want 
to. Students should observe the animal for 10–15 minutes on each of 
several days, and count the number of times each behavior occurs during 
those periods.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, you can focus on fewer activities. Students could 
just do a “behavioral repertoire” list, in which they just list the different 
actions that the animal performs, without counting them.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, students could construct a behavior-sequence 
chart, in which they list observed behaviors in the order they occur for a 
set period of time (usually short, such as 15–30 seconds). An example of  
a behavior-sequence might be, “Look left–look left–head shake– 
head shake–beak open–yawn–look left–head shake–still–still–loud call–
quiet call–head shake.”

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Influence of Area Ecology: Investigate the ecology of the area in which 
the animal is found and aspects such as the animal’s life history, types 
of food it eats, and reproductive behavior. This information can be used 
to understand and explain the behavior observations made by students 
when viewing the video. This information and observations made by the 
students can also be used in a literacy extension activity, such as writing 
a “Day in the life of your animal” narrative.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
This is a good opportunity to introduce students to qualitative data, because information 
collected in this activity cannot be predicted and involves observation notes. Assessment 
should be based on the types of observations made and the detail provided, rather than the 
frequency. Students should be encouraged to provide thick, rich notes.

STUDENT HANDOUT: ANIMAL BEHAVIOR ETHOGRAMS
Activity Goal
In this activity, you will construct a behavior map of animal behavior, 
called an ethogram.
Technology 
Notes
You will access data on the Explore website at http://explore.org. There, 
click on the “Live Cams” link. Find an animal you want to observe, click 
on that image, and then bookmark it so you can find it again later. Your 
teacher might ask you to use an app instead.
Orientation 
Questions
Why do animals exhibit the behaviors they do? Why do they do some 
things over and over again? Think of an example of this.
Directions
1.	 Observe your live video feed for 10–15 minutes. Make a list of the 
behaviors you see your animal species or animal do during this time, 
and write a description of each behavior. (Screen-captured images 
can help with this.) Enter these in the behavior-sequence chart on the 
back of this page.
2.	Observe how many times each of these behaviors happens during a 
15-minute period on different days. Record the weather information. 
Take written notes describing what you observe in the 15-minute 
period (these are called qualitative observations).
3.	After collecting this information on five or six days, look at the data 
and see whether there are patterns in the behaviors.
4.	Complete the Analysis Questions and Reflection Activity sections.

INVESTIGATIONS USING REAL-TIME BIOSPHERE DATA
Analysis Questions
1.	 Which activity was most common? Were there any differences over the five (or more) days 
you recorded your information?
2.	Why do you think those different behaviors were occurring? How might they help the 
animal (or its offspring or mate) to survive?
3.	Which do you think was the most important behavior you observed? Why do you think 
that? If you had problems deciding on the most important behavior, discuss why.
4.	What behavior did you expect to see but did not? Why?
5.	Imagine that it started raining. How do you think rain would affect the behaviors you 
observed? Why?
6.	How might the weather at other times of the year affect the animal you observed? Pick 
weather that is typical in another season and speculate about how that seasonal weather 
might influence the behavior(s) you observed.
Reflection Activity
Write a paragraph or two describing your observations and why you think those behaviors 
occurred over the period of your observations. Describe what you think about what you 
observed. Was there more or less activity than you expected? In thinking about your 
observations, discuss how an animal’s life is different from yours.

Background 
Information
Earth’s human population is now well over 7 billion, yet not all of those 
people have the same living conditions. A demographic transition model 
compares birth rates and death rates as countries transition from being 
an emerging economy to being an industrialized, or developed, economy. 
In this activity, for the purpose of comparing populations in emerging 
versus developed economies, a country with a gross domestic product 
(GDP) per person (“per capita”) of less than $10,000 U.S. dollars (USD) 
will be considered an emerging nation. One with a GDP per person of 
greater than $20,000 USD will be considered a developed country.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
The CIA World Factbook website has a responsive design and will work 
on small devices; however, its interactive map is Adobe Flash–based and 
will not work on some smartphone browsers. For example, on iPhones 
and iPads, it will work on the Puffin browser, but not on Safari. The data 
can still be accessed through the dropdown screen. The World Factbook 
and World Facts (iOS) apps are very large, because of the amount of 
data they contain. So although apps are available, students might not 
have enough storage on their devices for them and so using the website 
might be preferable.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: No sampling issues are anticipated. 
Data Type: Most comparisons are a nominal (that is, unordered category) 
data type, except for the population pyramid, which is ordinal (ordered 
category) but which is plotted with horizontal bars nonetheless.
Data Issues: No issues are anticipated. Most data are percentages (for 
which means should not be calculated, and there is no need for that). 
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
In this activity, students will compare an emerging nation to a developed 
nation using information obtained from CIA World Factbook website. 
Students will need to know how to calculate a percentage of a population 
to construct the population pyramid for each country. Students should 
have some familiarity with population pyramids and have access to 
calculators for the calculations.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity and help with the math required to construct 
the population pyramid, set up a spreadsheet that will calculate the 
percentages automatically. Students can also work in pairs, with each 
partner gathering the data for one of the two countries being compared.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, students can compare data for several countries 
with different GDP levels (for example, < $5,000, $5,000–10,000 USD.). 
To help provide a more complete understanding of the economic 
differences, have students include additional data, for example, 
agriculture, urbanization, disease, and energy.
Extending
A Day in the Life: Have students use the data from the CIA World 
Factbook website and other information they gather through research 
to create a journal for a typical child of their own age in each country. 
Alternatively, students can present the journal in the form of videos or 
social media pages, such as simulated Facebook pages.

United Nations Simulation: Divide the class into groups that represent 
either the emerging nation or the developed nation, and hold a mock 
United Nations assembly to address environmental issues identified in  
the activity.
Demographic Transition Model: Have students determine where each 
nation fits on the Demographic Transition model, and explain how they 
can tell.
Enrichment Using Data: Ask students to pick a variable for their chosen 
emerging country (for example, birth rate) and find historical data to 
track how this has changed over time. They could do the same with their 
chosen developed country.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Generally, more-developed nations will have lower birth and death rates than less-
developed ones. More-developed nations will also have better access to clean water and 
sanitation. Population pyramids for less-developed nations will have an expansive shape, 
whereas for more-developed nations, they might have more of a column-like shape.

STUDENT HANDOUT: EMERGING OR DEVELOPED?
Activity Goal
In this activity, you will compare population dynamics in emerging and 
developed nations, including what natural resources are available and 
how the populations use them.
Technology 
Notes
You will use the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) World Factbook 
website (https://cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-
factbook) or an app to find data for two countries.
Orientation 
Questions
•	 How would my life be different if I lived in an emerging nation?
•	 What are the differences between emerging and developed 
countries?
Directions
1.	 On the CIA World Factbook website or using the World Factbook 
(Android) or World Facts (iOS) app, identify one emerging nation 
and one developed country, using a gross domestic product (GDP) 
per person (“per capita”) of < $10,000 U.S. dollars (USD) to identify 
an emerging nation and of > $20,000 USD per person to identify a 
developed country. Try to pick countries no one else in your class has 
chosen. (Your teacher might decide to use a sign-up process to avoid 
repetition.)
2.	Under the “People and Society” section, find the total population 
for each country. Then, use the “Age Structure” data to calculate 
the percentage of males and females in the population for each age 
range. Use this information to construct a population pyramid (using 
horizontal bars going left [% Male] and right [% Female] from the 
bold center line).
3.	Under the “People and Society” and “Geography” sections, gather the 
remaining data for each country. Construct bar graphs to compare 
data for median age, improved drinking water, sanitation access, birth 
rate, death rate, and infant mortality rate. In list format, describe the 
natural resources, exports, and current environmental issues.
4.	Display your Country Comparison Data with others in the class and 
take a “gallery walk” to complete the Analysis Questions section.
5.	Complete the Conclusions and Reflection Question sections.

TEACHER NOTES: THIS LAND IS OUR LAND
Learning Goal
Students will explore long-term trends in land use using data from the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Disciplinary 
Core Ideas
•	 Natural resources
•	 Human impacts on Earth systems
Science and 
Engineering 
Practices
•	 Using mathematics and computational thinking
•	 Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information
Crosscutting 
Concepts
•	 Scale, proportion, and quantity
•	 Stability and change
Background 
Information
Our planet has changed significantly over the past half-century. Since 
World War II, the population of the planet has doubled and the ways we 
use our land resources have changed. Population shifts have occurred 
because of changes in lifestyle, technology, and urban development. 
The USDA has collected land-use data since 1945, including cropland, 
grassland, forests, urban, and other uses. By analyzing these data, 
students can see not only how humans have affected Earth’s systems, but 
also how land use changes over time.

INVESTIGATIONS USING REAL-TIME BIOSPHERE DATA
DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
The 2007 USDA Major Land Uses (MLU) Report data are downloaded 
from that website as Excel spreadsheet files. Students can access the 
reports through their devices and then “mine” the reports for the desired 
data. The U.S. Census Bureau and USDA Soil and Water RCA websites 
have responsive design and will adjust to the size of the user’s device. On 
the USDA Soil and Water RCA website, check “State” under “Scale,” then 
“Natural Resources” under “Subjects”; then, click the desired state for a 
list of available reports.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: No sampling issues are anticipated.
Data Type: The comparison data are the nominal type (because there are 
only two “year” categories, so no other patterns would be discernible). A 
bar graph comparison for the different categories could also be done.
Data Issues: Students must make sure the units for the categories across 
the two years being compared (for example, 1945, 2007) are the same. 
Different sources of information might use different units. 
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
Before beginning this investigation, students should have a firm 
understanding of how humans use land resources. They should also know 
how to calculate percentages and a percent increase or decrease. It is 
important that the teacher model how to retrieve data by projecting each 
website to guide students through acquiring the required data from for 
the activity.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, instead of having students plan and present data 
for different states, have individuals or groups collect and share data to 
contribute to the class for investigating only their home state. The state 
report could be the final outcome of the investigation or could be used 
as a modeling activity and to provide a scaffold to prepare students for 
individual or small-group investigations for the activity as written.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, have students calculate the percent change in 
land use—how much each category of land use (for example, cropland, 
forest, urban area) has increased or decreased over time. Students can 
also collect and report on interim data from the USDA and explore data 
changes by decade, rather than the overall period.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words: Students can add to their reports 
by doing extra research to find historical and current pictures of how 
farming, ranching, forestry, and urbanization have changed in their 
assigned state and adding these to their final product.
Climate Change: Ask students to explore whether and how the climate 
has changed in each state (or in major cities in each state) using historical 
climate data from other resources, such as the Weather Underground 
website (www.wunderground.com/history) or the Weather History 
Explorer app.
Enrichment Using Data: Students may collect data for multiple years 
(for example, 1945, 1955, 1965) to find out the patterns of change in the 
different categories.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Data collected will vary widely, depending on the state selected for the investigation. Most 
states have seen an increase in urban development since 1945, at the expense of other land 
uses. Assessment for analysis questions should be based on the explanations offered in 
comparing different states, rather than just on the data provided.

Questions
•	 Are land resources used the same way by people across the country? 
•	 How have the ways people use land resources changed over time?
Directions
1.	 Individually or in a group, as determined by your teacher, sign up for 
a specific state to research. Your teacher will tell you whether this 
may be any state or should be one in a specific geographic region(s).
2.	Access each website to retrieve the data according to the directions 
provided by your teacher. 
a. USDA 2007 MLU Report: Collect data for 1945 and 2007 for 
each of their land-use categories: Cropland, grassland, forest-
use, special use, urban area, and miscellaneous. Record these 
data in the table provided. Calculate the total land area for each 
time period. The total land area will be similar, but not identical, 
because of how the categories are defined and presented.
b. U.S. Census Bureau: Find the 2007 population of your 
research state from the “2000’s” link. Use the “Pre-1980” link to 
find 1945 population data.
c. USDA Soil and Water RCA Interactive Viewer: Check “State” 
under “Scale” and both “Profiles” and “Natural Resources” under 
“Subjects.” Then, click the desired state for a list of available 
reports and from that list, select “State Profile.” Look over these 
data for interesting facts and information but do not add them 
to your data table, because they were prepared with different

Background 
Information
Usually about 100,000 wildfires are reported each year in the United 
States. Although drought and wildfires are separate hazards, they are 
related. Weather conditions such as drought can contribute to wildfires, 
which can begin in dry, hot conditions. As climates change, areas that 
become hotter can have increased rates of evaporation, leading to drier 
conditions.

INVESTIGATIONS USING REAL-TIME BIOSPHERE DATA
DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: This activity requires students to sample drought data 
from a complex data set. The highest percentage of area experiencing 
extreme drought is to be considered the sample data point for each year. 
Instead of selecting the acreage of wildfires, students could instead work 
with the number of wildfires.
Data Type: The drought and wildfire data both are interval–ratio 
(measured) types of data.
Data Issues: The National Interagency Fire Center website data are 
annual, whereas the National Drought Monitor data are weekly, creating a 
mismatch between values. Calculating mean (average) and median values 
for each year would require an extra step but using those values might be 
more appropriate, because drought conditions vary across months within 
the same year. Note that the x-y graph will have two states on it, and a 
line of best fit will be required for each state, so students should use a 
different symbol (for example, * and +) for each data set.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
Students should have a basic understanding of drought conditions and 
understand the difference between a prescribed burn and a wildfire. The 
drought data will be more difficult for students to work with because 
they are broken down by week, whereas the wildfire data are supplied by 
state. Students will make generalizations from drought data by sorting 
through the weekly data to find the highest percentage of extreme 
drought severity for each year.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, reduce the amount of data collected by having 
students work only with data from the single highest and lowest drought 
years, rather than across the entire data span and data compared using 
simpler graphs, such as a bar graphs. Model the activity by collecting the 
data from your home state as a class, and then have students research 
additional states in teams, with one student collecting the wildfire data 
and the other drought data.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, students can collect drought data by category 
(abnormally dry, moderate drought, severe drought, extreme drought, 
exceptional drought) and can compare different types of statistics, such 
as population affected rather than area in drought. In addition, data can 
be presented annually as a double line graph of data over time.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Does El Niño Play a Part?: Have students research to see whether El Niño 
Southern Oscillation patterns (El Niño, La Niña) affect drought conditions 
in their area.
Climate Connections: Students can research annual temperature and 
precipitation data in their states to determine the relationship between 
weather and wildfires.
Wildfire Safety: Have students download the American Red Cross 
Wildfire app, research current wildfires, and then create a wildfire safety 
brochure.
Enrichment Using Data: To classify the drought before comparing it to 
wildfire data, students can develop a drought-severity index for each year 
that takes into account the number of weeks of drought, the severity of 
the drought, and the highest level reached over the course of the year.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
In general, expect to see a positive correlation between drought and wildfires; however, this 
might not always be the case because often other factors are involved as well.

in each of those years?
3.	Why was drought used as an indicator of climate conditions in this activity?
4.	Besides drought, what other variables could affect the number of wildfires?
5.	Would you expect the impact of drought to be the same for different biomes (for example, 
desert, woodland)? Why or why not?
Conclusions
Construct an explanation that describes why wildfires might be more likely to occur during or 
after drought years. Use evidence you collected, if applicable, to support your conclusion.
Reflection Question
With climates changing, some places are becoming hotter and drier. How might state officials 
change their preparedness for wildfires for states that are experiencing more droughts?

INVESTIGATIONS USING  
REAL-TIME GEOSPHERE DATA
T
he geosphere is composed of Earth’s surface and interior. It includes our planet’s 
core, mantle, and crust. It also includes rock and mineral resources and landforms 
and features, as well as the processes that shape Earth’s surface. Much of what we 
know about Earth’s interior is from seismic waves that travel through the planet at differ-
ent speeds as they pass through materials of different density and composition. Satellites 
collect data from above, and other instruments collect and analyze data on and below 
Earth’s surface.
When considering how to explore the geosphere using real-time data, earthquakes are 
most likely the first application that comes to mind. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 
(www.usgs.gov) website is the primary source of data on earthquakes, volcanoes, and 
geo­magnetism. Worldwide earthquake data usually include location, latitude, longi-
tude, magnitude, and depth. The data are collected from all over the planet and reported 
in real time.
Although earthquake data can be used to locate plate-tectonic boundaries, it can also 
be used to explore other relationships. For example, does the depth of the earthquake pro-
vide information about the type of plate boundary? The ability to search archived data 
allows students to compare current and past earthquake activity to identify trends and 
construct possible explanations. For example, the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program (http://
earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map) website data for Oklahoma shows 51 earthquakes of 
magnitude 4.0 and greater during the five years from January 1, 2011, to November 30, 
2015: 4 in 2011, 1 in 2012, 3 in 2013, 15 in 2014, and 28 in 2015 (see Figure 7.1, p. 142). They 
also show that nearly all of those earthquakes are very shallow, at depths of less than 10 
km. From this, students could determine that the number of earthquakes has increased 
annually. The question for students to consider from these observations is what possible 
explanations would possibly account for this increase in earthquake activity.
The activities in this chapter provide examples of how to use geosphere data in the 
classroom, and provide resources for finding those data and suggestions for using them. 
One of our favorite resources for real-time plate-tectonics data is Rice University (http://
tectonics.rice.edu/hs3.html). Using their interactive calculator, students can find the velocity 
and direction of plate motion under their feet or anywhere else in the world. Data from

this website shows that Seattle, Washington, on the North American plate, is moving at 
velocity of 23 mm/y in a direction of 250 degrees (azimuth angle of west-southwest). Just 
to the west by five degrees longitude in the Pacific Ocean, the Juan de Fuca plate is moving 
at nearly 21 mm/y in a direction of 49 degrees (azimuth angle of northeast). What do these 
data indicate about the type of plate motion occurring between these adjacent locations? 
By collecting data for various cities around the world, students can draw vectors on maps 
and create a visual model that illustrates the differences in plate motion.
The USGS Volcano Hazards Program (http://volcanoes.usgs.gov) monitors volcanoes in the 
United States; but although they have webcam coverage of various volcanoes, those more 
typically are shown on the website as still images from very recent feeds. The website also 
has subsites dedicated to the monitoring of individual volcanoes and that contain inter-
esting information for educating the public and science communities. Overall, though, 
the Volcano Hazards Program website provides very little real-time or other data on U.S. 
volcanoes for either viewing or download. The Global Volcanism Program website of the  
Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History (http://volcano.si.edu/index.
cfm) is a more-robust source of real-time volcano data, providing weekly updates on 
volcano events around the world. By correlating these data with the NASA Global Sulfur 
Dioxide Monitoring website (http://so2.gsfc.nasa.gov), students can explore the relationship 
between active volcanoes and atmospheric sulfur dioxide (SO2).

INVESTIGATIONS USING REAL-TIME GEOSPHERE DATA
The USGS does provide real-time data related to mineral resources and mines. Using 
the spatial-data service on the Mineral Resources Data System (MRDS) website (http://mrdata.
usgs.gov/mrds), students can download information about mining and minerals for any 
location of the United States. For example, data from the site for Forsyth County, Georgia, 
shows there are 20 known mining locations there. Of these, 12 are gold-mining sites—most 
of them past producers and a few listed as prospects. Four are potential operations for 
mica, none actively producing. Two are actively producing facilities for sand, gravel, and 
crushed stone; one is a magnetite-mining prospect; and one is an iron-mining prospect.
Students can use these mining data with data from the USGS National Geologic Maps 
Database website (http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/maps/mapview) to construct an explanation about 
why those mineral resources are found in this region of the state, which is dominated 
by metamorphic and igneous rock. Additional mining data can be found on the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH) website (www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/statistics/allmining.html), which pro-
vides some limited data on the location of mining locations and hazards associated with 
mining operations.

Background 
Information
The focus of an earthquake is the location where the earthquake 
originates. It is seldom on Earth’s surface; usually, it is on a fault within the 
crust. The epicenter is the place on the surface directly above the focus. 
Earthquakes occur at different depths and are classified by focus-depth 
range as shallow (0–70 km), intermediate (70–300 km), or deep (> 300 
km). The depth of an earthquake provides information about the type of 
plate boundary it is near. Deep earthquakes are more often associated 
with subduction zones and convergent boundaries, whereas shallow 
earthquakes are associated with divergent and transform boundaries.

INVESTIGATIONS USING REAL-TIME GEOSPHERE DATA
DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program website has a responsive design 
and is ideal for use on any device. The settings can be changed to view 
data for different magnitudes and periods of time. To collect enough data 
for the activity, students will need to change the settings to view data for 
earthquakes happening over a longer period of time.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: A teacher might want to encourage students to identify 
an “even” sampling of earthquakes (marked in blue, red, or green); that is, 
to spread out their samples geographically; rather than clustering them. 
It might be helpful to specify that they should record earthquakes within 
a given distance (for example, an area running 1,600 km along a plate 
boundary).
Data Type: Focal-depth data are the interval–ratio type and can be 
arithmetically summarized. The three focal-depth categories are the 
nominal data type, and so a bar graph could be used to compare them.
Data Issues: The Richter scale is a measurement of earthquake strength, 
or magnitude, which is a special type of data for which a mean cannot be 
calculated (see Chapter 4); however, one can calculate the mean of the 
focal-depth measurements to use for comparison. 
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
For this activity, students must understand the types of plate boundaries 
(divergent, convergent, transform) as they look for relationships between 
depth and boundary type. Teachers should reinforce knowledge of 
geologic features by stressing that ridges and rifts occur at divergent 
boundaries and trenches occur at convergent boundaries. Many of the 
events reported in the data use these terms.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, assign students work in groups to research a 
different type of plate boundary or even a specific boundary. Then, have 
students share their reports with the class. When assigning groups, 
consider that not as many events occur at divergent boundaries. You 
might want to assign fewer students to these areas.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, provide students with a map that shows the 
locations of plate boundaries but not their types. The USGS Earthquake 
Hazards Program website does not include plate-boundary information 
(although some apps do). Students can use the data they collect to 
construct explanations about the type of plate motion occurring at each 
boundary.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Find the Boundaries! Provide students with a map with no plate 
boundaries indicated and have them collect earthquake magnitude and 
depth data for that geographic area for a long time period (30 days or 
more). With the collected data, the students should be able to identify 
the type and location of most plate boundaries.
What’s the Impact? Have students research the newsworthy earthquakes 
that occur over the longer period of time to find out how they affect local 
populations.
Earthquake Safety: Using the American Red Cross Earthquake app 
(www.redcross.org/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/mobile-apps), 
have students construct a safety brochure about what to do in case 
of an earthquake, that includes basic information about the types of 
earthquakes and tectonic plate boundaries.
Enrichment Using Data: Students could draw a bar graph comparing 
earthquakes of the three focal-depth categories, putting the raw data on 
it by hand so they get a sense of the variation around the mean (average).
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Most earthquakes occur near tectonic-plate boundaries, and most should occur near active 
faults. In general, earthquakes are deeper near convergent boundaries, where subduction is 
occurring, than near divergent or transform plate boundaries. Expect outliers in the data.

INVESTIGATIONS USING REAL-TIME GEOSPHERE DATA
Analysis Questions
The focus of an earthquake is the location where the earthquake originates. An earthquake is 
categorized by the depth of its focus as shallow (0–70 km deep), intermediate (70–300 km) 
or deep (> 300 km).
1.	 What can the depth of an earthquake’s focus tell you about the type of tectonic plate 
boundary it is most likely associated with?
2.	At which type of plate boundary do the deepest earthquakes occur? Are most earthquakes 
at this boundary considered shallow, intermediate, or deep?
3.	 At which type of plate boundary do the shallowest earthquakes occur? Are most 
earthquakes at this boundary considered shallow, intermediate, or deep?
4.	How do your data compare to data of your classmates?
Conclusions
Using what you know about the different type of tectonic plate boundaries, construct an 
explanation that discusses at which type of plate boundary the deepest earthquakes are most 
likely to occur and why.
Reflection Question
How does Earth’s structure provide insight into where the deepest earthquakes are most likely 
to occur?

TEACHER NOTES: RADON MAPPER
Learning Goal
Students will learn about the radiation levels in their state and county 
and compare them to levels in two other states. Teaching about radon 
addresses a safety issue and relates to content knowledge about 
radiation and geology.

Background 
Information
Radon is an invisible, radioactive gas that comes from soil and rocks. It 
is naturally occurring, odorless, and colorless. It can become a health 
hazard if it accumulates to higher concentrations in our homes, schools, 
and offices. Determining the level of radon in such locations is important, 
because radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in people who have 
never smoked (and the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the 
United States overall). Groundwater has a higher concentration of radon 
than surface water, because radon is produced by the radioactive decay 
of radium that is present in rocks. Radon in homes usually enters the 
building directly from the soil that is in contact with the lower parts of 
the buildings (for example, basements); cracks in a building’s foundation 
can increase radon entry. Also, high levels of radon in the water supply 
can raise radon levels in the air in buildings. The U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) believes any radon level above 4 picocuries per 
liter of air (pCi/L) requires further monitoring and/or mitigating action.

Notes
The EPA Radon website has a responsive design—it works on small 
devices and its page “snaps” to the screen size of the device; however, 
it can be challenging to work with the map on a small screen. The State-
Radon website does not have a responsive design, but works well on 
small devices.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: Sampling is relatively straightforward because students are 
counting the number of counties at each radon risk level in three states.
Data Type: Comparisons of radon-level frequencies between states are 
nominal level. 
Data Issues: None. 
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
Students will use the EPA Radon website to record and summarize radon 
data for three states in the data table of their activity handout. Teachers 
might want to have a preceding lesson on the types and sources of 
radioactivity, why radioactivity is a risk factor for humans, and how 
exposure to radioactivity can be mitigated. Students will need to be 
aware that the EPA categorizes radon exposure into three risk levels, 
according to the level of radon radioactivity involved.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, have students examine the radon levels in just 
their own state.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, students could be asked to complete a more 
complex table that compares rock types commonly found in areas with 
low, medium, and high radon levels.
Extending
Income Versus Radon Risk: Have the students pick 10 to 20 random 
counties for each of the risk zones and then use U.S. Census Bureau 
data (for example, www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/interactive/
saipe.html?s_appName=saipe&map_yearSelector=2014&map_
geoSelector=mhi_c&s_measures=mhi_snc) to examine the relationship 
between “Median Household Income (state/county)” and general radon 
risk. (This is graphed with income on the y-axis and three tic marks 
representing zones 1, 2, and 3 on the x-axis. A mark for income would be 
recorded for each county over the appropriate zone.)
Public Service Announcement Video: Have students make a radon 
public service announcement video for their school announcements that 
includes basic information about radon, as well as information on radon 
risk in their area, how to check for radon levels in the home, what the 
risks of radon exposure are over time, and what to do if radon risk is a 
problem where they live.

1.	 How does your state compare to the other two states for radon risk?
2.	Find a geologic map. Do the three states have different types of rock? Does rock type 
relate to radon level? Why did you conclude this?
3.	Is radon gas more or less dense than air? What does this mean for where you might find

Background 
Information
Earth’s crust is divided into dozens of plates. Sources vary on this, but 
our planet’s crust is divided into as many as 58 tectonic plates that move 
2.5–15 cm/y. These plates slide in different directions across the Earth’s 
asthenosphere, and as they move, they slowly reshape the surface of the 
planet.

Notes
Several websites are available that can be used for calculating tectonic 
plate motion. The Rice University Plate Motion Calculator is one of the 
simplest, having the fewest input fields as well as a responsive design 
that works well on a smartphone or tablet. It is important to note that the 
latitude input field requires the use of a plus sign for northern latitudes and 
a minus sign for southern latitudes, and the longitude input field requires 
the use of a plus sign for locations east of the prime meridian and a minus 
sign for those west of the prime meridian.

INVESTIGATIONS USING REAL-TIME GEOSPHERE DATA
DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: The simplest use of the website tool is to choose a 
tectonic plate and execute the calculation without entering a longitude 
and latitude. Each velocity measure can be compared.
Data Type: The data are the nominal data type (the tectonic plates are 
all independent from each other), and could be graphed; however, no 
graphing is being done in this activity.
Data Issues: Data will be entered on a map with an arrow line that 
represents the direction of the plate movement. For students to use the 
line length to represent the amount of movement, scaling will be needed. 
(For example, some plates move > 100 mm/y, which would be difficult 
to represent with a 1:1 vector line unless students had a large map.) The 
activity suggests a 1:0.5 ratio. Otherwise, students must calculate a ratio 
(a divisor) that works for the size of their maps (and teachers might have 
to help them with this), so that the lines all fit on the map. 
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
Several challenges could arise, depending on students’ mapping skills 
and understanding of vectors; students are probably less familiar with 
drawing vectors. A vector is an arrow that shows the magnitude and 
direction of a variable. Start at the point and draw in the direction of the 
azimuth (degrees clockwise from north). To fit the page, each vector 
must be drawn at 50% of scale, that is, at half as long as the rate or 
distance of plate motion it represents. Higher rates (distance) mean 
longer arrows. This activity could be used to introduce students to 
plate tectonics by having them identify different types of plate tectonic 
boundaries (convergent, divergent, transform), based on the map they 
create.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, preselect representative cities for students to 
collect data on, rather than allowing them to make their own list. Teachers 
might also want to provide the latitude and longitude information in 
advance. To make the vectors easier to illustrate, have students draw an 
arrow with the correct orientation (azimuth), without concern about the 
vector’s proportion (length). The model produced will allow students to 
see the core concept, that Earth’s tectonic plates are moving in different 
directions; however, it will be limited in that students will not be able to 
compare velocities.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, provide students with a map that does not 
show tectonic plate boundaries and have them determine where those 
boundaries are based on the data they collect.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Earth in 10,000 Years: Ask students to assume that the tectonic 
plates will continue in the same direction and velocity for the next 
100,000 years. (Be sure they also know that is unlikely and tectonic 
plate movements are dynamic and constantly changing.) Based on this 
activity’s assumption, what might Earth’s surface look like in 100,000 
years? How might local climates change?
Enrichment Using Data: Students might find it useful to draw a bar graph 
of the yearly tectonic plate movement, ordered from least to most, to get 
an understanding of the variation in this among the plates each year.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Depending on the locations chosen, different places on the same plate can be moving in 
different directions. One of the most important things to assess is whether the vectors are 
accurately drawn based on the data collected.

STUDENT HANDOUT: TECTONIC PLATE SHUFFLE
Activity Goal
In this activity, you will develop a model that illustrates tectonic plate 
movement at different locations on Earth’s surface.
Technology 
Notes
Gather data using the Rice University Plate Motion Calculator (http://
tectonics.rice.edu/hs3.html) and use those data to construct vectors (that 
is, lines with an arrow) on a map to illustrate the velocity and direction of 
tectonic plate movement.
Orientation 
Questions
•	 Are all tectonic plates moving in the same direction or at the same 
rate?
•	 Does every location on the same plate move at the same speed and in 
the same direction?
•	 How can vectors be used to help visualize data?
Directions
1.	 Identify 12 cities that currently exist, one on each of the major 
tectonic plates with human populations that are shown on the map 
for this activity (that is, exclude plates that are under water, such as 
the Nazca Plate).
2.	Find the latitude and longitude for each city by using an internet 
search engine (for example, Google) or an app suggested by your 
teacher.
3.	Find the rate and azimuth for each city/plate by using the Rice 
University online Plate Motion Calculator through a web browser on 
a computer, smartphone, or tablet. In the calculator, select the plate 
on which the city is located, enter the city’s latitude and longitude 
coordinates, and then click “Execute Calculation.”
4.	Record all of these data in the table provided.
5.	Complete the Data Analysis by constructing vectors on the map, 
based on the data.
a.	Mark the approximate location for each city on the map.
b.	Cut out the picture of the compass in this handout and place it on 
each location, with the compass center on each city’s location and 
the compass “N” pointing upward. Mark the direction the plate is 
moving based on the azimuth data.
c.	Draw an arrow from the location of the city outward and in the 
direction the plate is moving. This arrow should be drawn at 
50% of scale, that is, half as long as the rate or distance of plate 
motion, in millimeters (mm).
6.	Complete the Analysis Questions, Conclusion, and Reflection 
Question sections.

Background 
Information
According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website (https://
volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/nvews.html), the United States has over 160 
active volcanoes, more than 50 of which are designated “high priority 
threats”; almost 20 of those are considered ”highest priority.” Volcanoes 
are found where tectonic plates meet or at “hot spots” where Earth’s 
crust is thin. The threat level of a volcano is determined by its potential to 
erupt, the local population, its past eruption frequency, and the size of its 
past eruptions.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
The USGS Volcano Hazards Program website does not have a responsive 
design and is difficult to use on small devices; however, the Volcanoes 
app is excellent, especially for volcanoes that are well-known. The app 
does not provide extensive data for all locations. Look for the “i” symbol 
(shown on the screenshot from the app) to find volcanoes about which 
the app has additional information. There are several other free apps that 
can be used as an alternative. Students will likely need to use the web 
browser on their devices to access those additional research components.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: Students should select their volcanoes so that they are 
spread out in different areas.
Data Type: Comparisons of different volcano-eruption frequencies 
over time are interval–ratio (that is, by time); however, comparisons of 
volcanoes (using a bar chart to show eruption frequency) are nominal-
level.
Data Issues: Where data are available, most should be fairly 
straightforward. Where data are not available, students might have to do 
counts and estimates of populations within the stated range. 
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
Ideally, students will understand plate tectonics and earthquakes before 
examining the topic of volcanoes. In this activity, students will pick 
five active volcanoes and assess the risk from each one by looking at 
its history of volcanic activity, location in relation to local population 
numbers, and ash and/or gas risk (which requires an understanding of 
prevailing winds). There are five volcano observatories in the United 
States (http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/observatories.html). One difficulty 
that might arise for students is that the different observatories provide 
varying information, each reporting relevant data for volcanoes in that 
jurisdiction. For instance, the Alaska observatory provides a detailed 
visual depiction of known historical volcanic events for each volcano; 
others might provide that information but not in a format that is as easily 
accessed.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, rather than allowing students to choose the 
volcanoes, the teacher can assign groups of students to report on 
volcanoes found in each of the five U.S. volcano observatories (http://
volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/observatories.html). Alternatively, each student 
could be assigned one volcano to report on to the rest of the class, and 
the class collectively could design a way of evaluating risk. Population 
size near the volcano could be a risk category (small, medium, large, very 
large), with population numbers per category specified by the teacher.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Scaling Up
For added complexity, students could integrate plate movement into 
the estimation of volcanic risk. Earthquake activity in the area of each 
volcano could also be depicted on the graph to identify a possible 
correlation.
Extending
Local Historical Stories: The teacher might see whether there are any 
indigenous elders in the area of the studied events who have historical 
stories about earthquakes or volcanic eruptions in their region. (Of 
course, this might not be possible in areas of the United States that are 
less prone to these events).
Enrichment Using Data: Students could be asked to relate volcanic 
activity to direction of plate movement and to crust thickness.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Depending on the specific volcanoes chosen for this investigation, students might see 
a variety of data. Some volcanoes are less active than others; those with more frequent 
events and higher nearby populations should be assigned higher risk.

Analysis Questions
1.	 Which of your volcanoes has been most active recently? Historically?
2.	Which of your volcanoes has the greatest risk of eruption? Why do you believe that? What 
evidence did you use to come to that conclusion? Rank your volcanoes from highest risk to 
lowest risk on the basis of that evidence.
3.	Does being volcanically inactive for a long time create a higher risk of eruption or a lower 
one? How might the level of recent volcanic activity relate to earthquake activity? To 
tectonic plate movement?
4.	How does Earth’s crust being thinner at some places relate to volcanic activity? What 
relationship might this have to some groups of volcanoes looking as though they are in a 
line?
5.	What types of gasses can come out of a volcano? How does this relate to prevailing winds? 
What role might these gasses and volcanic ash play in climate change?
Conclusions
Compare the location of active volcanoes to the location of plate tectonic boundaries. 
Construct an explanation that describes the relationship between tectonic plate boundaries 
and the presence and activity of volcanoes.
Reflection Question
Does the pattern of recent volcanic activity help predict future events? Why or why not?

INVESTIGATIONS USING  
REAL-TIME HYDROSPHERE DATA
T
he hydrosphere is the watery part of Earth. Whether the water is on the surface as riv-
ers, oceans, and streams; floating aloft as a cloud; or under the surface as an aquifer, it 
is part of the hydrosphere. Earth’s surface is approximately 70% water, and data on all 
that water are collected by satellites and surface instruments. Satellites can track sea-surface 
temperature; glacier movements; changes in water-table levels, salinity, and tides; and many 
other data. Ground instruments can measure small changes in the dissolved oxygen level in 
a river, the velocity of water in a stream, and the depth of water in a dam. For the purposes 
of this book, we include the cryosphere (frozen water) in this chapter.
An important website for real-time ocean-surface data is the National Oceanic and  
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) (www.ndbc.
noaa.gov). Using this website, students can explore real-time data for ocean waves, wind 
speed, water temperature, and more, from buoys and monitoring stations. As suggested 
in Chapter 1, students can use NDBC data to investigate how wind speed affects wave 
height, but they also can use it to explore other relationships. Video feeds can be used to 
collect observational data on Earth’s hydrosphere. NOAA provides buoy cams in a few 
locations, but those provide visual data for exploring various ocean surface conditions. 
Marina and dock cameras can also be a rich source of visual, real-time data.
NOAA also provides tide data from tide stations all along the U.S. coastline (http://
tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tsunami). Students could use these data to compare and contrast 
tidal patterns for different locations, or could collect data for different periods over several 
weeks and determine the impact of Moon phases on tides. NOAA also has the nowCOAST 
web page (http://nowcoast.noaa.gov), which goes beyond tide data and includes coastal 
observations, forecasts, and warnings, including forecasts of algae blooms.
Although NOAA does provide some real-time data for inland waterways, the ultimate 
resource for river and stream data is the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water  
Information System website (http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt). Information for thousands 
of streams and rivers across the country is provided in real time with a color-coded 
system showing above normal streamflow in blues with below normal in reds (see  
Figure 8.1, p. 172). Links to each monitoring station provide a wealth of data, including 
discharge in cubic feet per second (cfs), drainage area, and water temperature. The USGS

WaterQualityWatch website (http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/wqwatch) provides information on 
fewer locations, but provides current quality data for water, including temperature, pH, 
turbidity, and levels of nitrates and dissolved oxygen. With these data, students can con-
duct investigations into the relationship between weather and streamflow, compare data 
from different monitoring stations on the same river, and explore environmental factors 
that can affect stream health.

The USGS also monitors groundwater (http://
groundwaterwatch.usgs.gov/net/ogwnetwork.
asp?ncd=rtn), providing data that students can 
use to investigate the depth of multiple locations 
and explore variables that affect the water table 
(for example, weather and seasonal fluctuations) 
to better understand droughts. Figure 8.2 is a 
graph from the site that shows the water table 
height at a well in Santa Barbara, California, over 
the past 20 years. The effects of a recent drought 
in California on the water table are evident, 
and the site allows analysis of historical trends. 
In addition, the USGS Groundwater Watch web-
site provides satellite views of well locations, 
giving students an opportunity to see the loca-
tion of each site and investigate more complex 
relationships among topography, land use, and 
groundwater.

The NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) website (http://nsidc.org) provides 
nearly real-time data on the cryosphere. Students can view sea ice levels in the Arctic and 
Antarctic and observe temporal trends. Figure 8.3 shows current Arctic sea ice levels, which 
can be graphically compared to prior years. Of particular interest is its repository of more than 
30 years’ worth of satellite observations of Arctic change, which provides satellite images of 
sea ice, vegetation, snow cover, water vapor, and other elements of the arctic region.
Students can observe patterns of change and correlate to historical weather and climate 
data from the NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) data repository website (https://ncdc.noaa.
gov/cdo-web). Other student investigations could include relationships between sea ice and 
ocean currents, how climate change affects sea ice, and investigations into albedo (reflec-
tion) and sea ice with corresponding data from the NASA Earth Observations (NEO) website 
(http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov). Additional data provided by NEO include graphical models of 
permafrost, snow cover, and more. As you explore the activities that follow for investigating 
the hydrosphere, think about other ways you could use real-time data in your classroom.
Tables 8.1 and 8.2 (pp. 199 and 200, respectively) list all digital resources used in this 
chapter.

Background 
Information
Ocean waves are mechanical waves, formed from the energy of the 
wind as it moves across the water’s surface. Wave size depends on three 
things: wind speed, wind distance (fetch), and wind duration. Sustained, 
high winds blowing over long distances produce the highest surface 
waves. Data for this investigation are from the National Oceanographic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center 
(NDBC) website. The NDBC website provides data for wind speed, but 
not for wind fetch and wind duration (although those can be estimated).

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
Not every buoy provides the information necessary to complete the 
activity. Some just include wind and weather information; others just 
show wave or wind information, so this investigation likely will involve 
searching out a set of buoy stations that fulfill the data need. Depending 
on the resource used to access it, the data might be available as a map or 
a list.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: Teachers should help students determine the geographic 
location and date and/or time for collecting their data. Sampling could 
be done at one time or several times in one day (which they could use as 
data points or to calculate a mean, or average).
Data Type: Wave height should be reported in feet and wind speed in 
knots. Both are interval–ratio (measured) data types.
Data Issues: Buoy distance from shore might be a confounding factor; 
students can explore this by graphing wind speed versus distance and 
wave height versus distance. Expect outliers and weaker relationships 
because of the number of confounding factors.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
It is important that students understand that although the data likely will 
show that wave height is correlated to wind speed, the fetch and wind 
duration also affect wave height. Asking students to identify outliers and 
to discuss possible reasons for them will build their understanding of the 
system.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, the data could be collected by the teacher in 
advance or the site could be projected on a white board for students to 
collect the data as a class. Alternatively, students could work in pairs, 
each collecting one or two data points, and then pool data together to 
work as a large group or class to analyze the collected data.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, show students a video clip of a ship in a storm 
and pose the question “How does weather affect wave height?” Allow 
students to brainstorm what variables there would be and what data they 
would need to collect to conduct their own investigation. Alternatively, 
students could compare data for air pressure, distance to shore, or other 
variables, or compare data from the Great Lakes to data for the open 
ocean. Great sources for downloading data for shoreline locations are 
surfing websites (for example, www.surf-forecast.com) and apps (for 
example, Surfline).

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Waves: Waves are essential for surfing! So, what is the science of surfing? 
To investigate this, make a wave bottle. Fill a used, clear water bottle 
halfway with blue water (that is, water with added blue food coloring) 
and the rest with mineral oil. Cap the bottle and gently roll it back and 
forth to simulate the wave action.
Wave Barriers: What are wave barriers, and how do they work? Why 
would you want one if you lived near the ocean? Conduct an engineering 
project to build and test a wave barrier.
Enrichment Using Data: Students could explore the relationship by 
comparing one coast to another, onshore and offshore wind directions, 
and/or data from buoys different distances from shore. The effect of the 
duration of wind from the same direction might also be worth exploring 
for more-advanced students.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
There is usually a positive correlation between wind speed and wave height, although fetch 
and duration also affect wave height. Expect outliers in the data.

DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND WATER QUALITY
Learning Goal
Students will explore the relationship between water temperature and 
dissolved oxygen.

Background 
Information
Dissolved oxygen in aquatic ecosystems is essential to supporting life and 
its level in water is a key indicator of water quality. Aeration of moving 
water increases the dissolved oxygen in a stream, while bacteria thriving 
on decaying matter or pollution quickly use it up and thus reduce its 
level. As the level of dissolved oxygen level increases, the diversity of 
organisms increases and the overall health of the river/stream improves. 
Water temperature also affects the amount of dissolved oxygen in rivers 
and streams. Cold water holds more dissolved oxygen, but as water 
temperature rises, oxygen solubility decreases.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
When accessing data on the USGS website, select “table” for the output 
format so that students do not have to try to interpret the values from 
graphs. The website allows the user to access information for past dates, 
whereas the apps only allow access current data. Therefore, if the website 
is used, the focus of an investigation could be limited to a single station 
over several months, but students using the apps would need to collect 
data on a single day from multiple sites. Not all sites provide dissolved-
oxygen and temperature data; many are limited to gage height and 
discharge. When using the USGS website, select “Dissolved Oxygen” as 
the desired measurement before looking at station data. When using the 
iOS app, look for stations with five or more gauges to locate the desired 
data.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: The issues discussed in the Technology Notes section 
of this activity can cause sampling issues. Also, the rate of water flow 
(influenced by rainfall) can cause substantial day-to-day changes in 
levels of dissolved oxygen. Students making comparisons might want to 
standardize their data based on recent rainfall, or otherwise account for 
rainfall levels.
Data Type: Rainfall and dissolved oxygen levels are both interval–ratio 
data, usually examined using a scatter plot.
Data Issues: No data issues should arise other from missing data.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
The purpose of this activity is for students to see the relationship 
between water temperature and the levels of dissolved oxygen in rivers 
and streams. Not all rivers have the same characteristics, and other 
variables such as streamflow velocity, type and amount of vegetation, 
and topography will also affect the levels of dissolved oxygen. Ask 
students to identify outliers and discuss possible variables to help build 
their understanding of aquatic ecosystems.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, students can collect a single data point and share 
it with other groups to work as a class. Teachers could also collect the 
data in advance for students to analyze. When using the USGS website, 
turn off all data except for temperature and dissolved oxygen to avoid 
confusing students with extraneous data points.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, have students look for other relationships in 
other variables, for example, precipitation, turbidity, and conductivity. 
In addition, students can use the USGS EarthExplorer website (http://
earthexplorer.usgs.gov) to find one or more geographic location and 
identify local topography and other features that can affect water quality.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Changes in Multiple Variables: Using data from the USGS 
WaterQualityWatch website, students can monitor conditions over time 
to look for changes in multiple variables. They could do this by collecting 
data from a single site over a long period (for example, monthly for a 
year) or conduct an in-depth investigation for a short period of time. 
With these data, students could assess the impact that long-term 
variations such as drought have at a single station.
Water Quality and Ecosystem: Another possible activity is to monitor 
water quality of a single stream as it flows through rural and urban areas.
Enrichment Using Data: Students might find it useful to graph dissolved 
oxygen versus rainfall over one year to see patterns over that period. 
Comparing dissolved oxygen versus temperature on “steep” versus “flat” 
areas of a river would also reveal interesting patterns.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Generally, colder water has higher levels of dissolved oxygen. Other factors that might 
affect levels of dissolved oxygen include topography, flow rate, and the presence of biologic 
organisms.

Background 
Information
Oceans affect climate by transporting heat from the equator toward the 
poles while transporting cool water from the poles toward the equator. 
The prevailing winds (from the west, at the midlatitudes) are warmed or 
cooled by the ocean before they pass over land. As an example of this 
ocean effect on climate, the year-round climate is usually milder for U.S. 
West Coast cities than for East Coast locations. In the summer, West Coast 
cities are usually cooler than East Coast cities because the air on the West 
Coast has been cooled by passing over the cold California Current. But 
winters on the West Coast are also milder than on the East Coast, because 
water heats and cools very slowly and during the winter, the Pacific Ocean 
continues to warm the air that moves over it before passing over land.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
Students will first need to identify cities by latitude, either using the 
LatLong website or an app, so they then can find cities at similar latitudes. 
The Weather History Explorer app provides much more information than 
students will need for this activity, but the information students need 
(mean [average] high and low temperature [°F] for each location) is shown 
with the green bar near the bottom of the screen (not the blue bar).
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: Teachers might need to help students determine which 
cities to use so that they are distributed along the entire coast. This 
allows a fair comparison of the two coasts.
Data Type: Temperature/temperature range is the “measured” (or 
interval–ratio) type of data so means can be calculated.
Data Issues: No data issues anticipated.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
In this activity, students will compare climates for east and west coast 
cities in North America to see how oceans mitigate the climate of 
locations on the west coast. Students will need to identify cities at both 
locations at approximately the same latitude with one app or website, 
and then the mean high and low temperatures for each city with a second 
app or website. Students should have experience with differential heating 
and cooling of land and water before completing this investigation.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, provide students with a list of cities at similar 
latitudes (for example, Portland, Maine, and Eugene, Oregon, at 43.6N 
latitude) and assign them to collect data on individual locations as a jigsaw 
activity.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, have groups of students collect data at specific 
latitude bands (for example, 30° to 39°, 40° to 49°, 50° to 59°) and then 
share their data to compare the variations that occur at different latitudes. 
Students can plot the data on a scatter plot to determine whether there is 
relationship between latitude and temperature range in the data collected. 
They also will see how various cold and warm water currents affect climate.
Extending
Effects of Other Variables: Have students collect data for temperature 
and precipitation for five cities along the same line of latitude across 
the United States. These data should be plotted on a map, along with 
geographic features such as mountains. Then students can analyze the 
collected data to determine other variables, such as topography and 
effect on climate.
Enrichment Using Data: There might be considerable variation in the 
data around the mean range. After students have plotted the bar graph, 
have them put marks where the “range” for each city would be found and 
have them incorporate that information into their conclusions.

Background 
Information
Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon. 
Activities such as shipping, sailing, scuba diving, and fishing are all affected 
by tides. During the new and full Moons, Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are 
aligned, and the tug of gravity causes the greatest tidal range. This tidal 
range is called the “spring tide.” During the first quarter and last quarter 
Moon phases, the Sun and Moon are perpendicular to Earth, pulling Earth’s 
oceans in different directions. During these phases, the tidal range is 
smaller and referred to as “neap tide.” However, coastal topography also 
helps determine the tidal range for any given location. In some places, 
such as the Bay of Fundy, Canada, the differences in tidal range are 
large, whereas other locations, such as the northern Gulf Coast (coasts of 
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama), see very small differences.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
If accessing data through a web browser, students will first have to find 
the Moon phase data on the USNO website, and then find the tide data 
on the NOAA website. If using the app, students can go to the calendar 
view for the current month and select the Moon phases from the calendar 
for different locations. Note that the data are given in feet for all locations 
in both the app and the NOAA website.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: No data sampling issues anticipated. It might help 
students to pick places they have visited or places they would like to go. 
Students should record tidal height for the same day and Moon phase for 
each location.
Data Type: Tide height is interval–ratio data type, and Moon phase is an 
ordinal (sequential/time) variable in which cycles will be observed.
Data Issues: Depending on their direction, strong winds can influence 
tidal height considerably, so there can be considerable variation in 
measured tides versus anticipated tides. 
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
Students should be careful to choose locations on the coast, not inland. 
Some locations have only one high and low tide a day (diurnal), whereas 
others have two (semidiurnal), and still others have a tidal pattern of one 
tide greater than the second each day (mixed). For locations with mixed, 
semidiurnal tides, have students collect data for the greater of the tides.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, identify specific locations for which you want 
student to collect data, and pull up their tidal charts. Project or print the 
tidal charts and have students work from them, instead of finding the tide 
information in the app or on the website.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, ask students to work in groups, with each group 
concentrating on a specific coastal location (for example, Gulf, Atlantic, 
Pacific). Then, map and compare the data from each group. Have 
students compare tidal patterns (diurnal, semidiurnal, or mixed). Using 
the website, rather than the app, pull tidal charts for specific locations 
and have students predict the phase of the Moon.

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Tidal Data: Have students collect tidal data over a period of several days 
and then trade data with each other. Students then could graph the data 
they received to create their own charts.
Tides as Energy: Research how tides can be used as a source of energy 
for power plants.
Patterns in Time: Have students explore patterns in time and identify the 
time span between consecutive high and low tides.
Coastal Topography Effects: Explore how coastal topography affects 
tides.
Enrichment Using Data: More-advanced students can do a comparison 
between predicted and measured tide height and relate these to wind 
direction and shoreline features.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Student data should show greater tidal ranges during the full and new Moons (spring tide) 
and smaller ranges during the quarter phases (neap tide). Different locations may have 
greater differences in overall tidal ranges, depending on coastal topography.

Conclusions
When scientists determine a causal relationship, they propose a mechanism to explain the 
cause. Write an explanation for observed variations in the tidal patterns that describes the 
role of gravity as the mechanism in producing Earth’s tides.
Reflection Questions
What is the difference between correlation and causality? Does correlation necessarily 
indicate causation?

INVESTIGATIONS USING  
REAL-TIME CELESTIAL SPHERE 
DATA
D
ata sets that deal with Earth’s place in the universe include solar and lunar phe-
nomena, celestial events, satellite orbits, and more. Phenomena such as sunset 
and sunrise times, Moon phases, planetary transits, incoming solar radiation, 
and fluctuations in Earth’s magnetic field are important to all Earth’s systems. They are 
observed with instruments on Earth’s surface and from satellites orbiting our planet.
The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) website (www.usno.navy.mil/USNO) is the best 
source of data for sunrise and sunset times; Moon phases; azimuth and altitude positions 
of celestial objects, including the Sun and the Moon; and much more. There are many 
investigations students could perform using data from the USNO website. For example, 
students could explore seasonal variations in photoperiods at the location of their home, or 
compare sunrise and sunset data for locations at different latitudes on any given day. The 
azimuth and altitude of the Sun and the Moon can help students understand insolation 
(energy received from the Sun) and seasons.
As an example, Table 9.1 (p. 202) contains monthly data for the Sun’s altitude over the 
period of one year. The 21st day of each month was chosen because it corresponds most 
closely with the solstices and equinoxes. The altitude data shows the angular height of the 
Sun above the horizon. To better understand the data, picture the sky as 360°­—a circle with 
its edges along its horizon. The altitude is how far above the horizon an object appears, 
given in degrees, with 90° being at the zenith, or the point over your head. Analyzing these 
data or constructing a model to illustrate the monthly differences would help students see 
how incoming solar radiation changes during the course of the year because of seasonal 
changes in insolation.
The USNO website also provides azimuthal data that helps students track objects in the 
sky. Azimuth is the angle from north on the horizon, in degrees. Finding azimuth is like 
using a compass, with 0° and 360° due north, 90° east, 180° south, and 270° west. Knowing 
both the altitude and azimuth of a celestial body will allow students to find objects in the 
sky in real time.
The NASA Earth Observations (NEO) website (http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov) provides graphic 
data of energy in Earth’s systems, including incoming solar radiation, ultraviolet radiation,

land and sea surface temperatures, and outgoing longwave radiation. These images can 
be used to explore seasonal variations, compare data trends over the last decade, and sup-
port investigations using data from other sources. For example, when investigating the 
differences in insolation using solar altitude referred to in Table 9.1, students can view the 
images provided to visualize how incoming solar energy changes as the angle of the Sun 
increases and decreases.
On its Human Space Flight Realtime Data website (http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata), 
NASA also provides real-time data for tracking satellites. A nongovernment website, 
FlightAware (https://flightaware.com/live), allows tracking and information about current air 
traffic. Students can monitor the flight paths of satellites to better understand how data 
are collected, and monitor air plane traffic to better understand the curvature of Earth’s 
surface. The activities that follow provide examples of how to use these data.
Tables 9.2 and 9.3 (pp. 224 and 226, respectively), list all digital resources used in this 
chapter.

Background 
Information
Seasons on Earth are a result of Earth’s axial tilt as it orbits the Sun. In 
the summer, the hemisphere facing the Sun has longer days and receives 
more direct sunlight. In the winter, the days are shorter. The length of 
the day varies through the year because the Sun’s path across the sky 
lengthens in the summer and shortens in the winter. At the equator, 
days are nearly always 12 hours long; however, as you move away from 
the equator toward the pole, summer-month photoperiods lengthen 
and winter-month photoperiods shorten. The U.S. Naval Observatory 
(USNO) maintains precise data from tracking the seasonal changes in 
photoperiods and the path of the Sun and the Moon as they move across 
the sky. Students will access these data to compare the changes in 
photoperiods through seasons at different latitudes.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
The USNO website has a responsive design and will work on small 
devices. The Sun Rise and Fall app calculates and shows the “Sun Up” 
time, and for this reason is better for students who might have difficulty 
calculating the photoperiods from sunrise and sunset times. Both apps 
require students to drop or move the “pin,” whereas the USNO website 
requires students to enter in location names. On the website, students 
will need to use Form A for locations in the United States and Form B for 
locations outside the United States.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: No sampling issues anticipated.
Data Type: The data for comparison are the interval–ratio data type (that 
is, dates), but the data points for photoperiod-length points representing 
June 21–September 21–December 21 will be joined, essentially making the 
categories the ordinal (that is, ordered category) data type.
Data Issues: The scatter plot in this activity is a more complex type, with 
a nonlinear line of best fit. Students might benefit from being shown a 
rough model of what it will look like. Students might also want to convert 
the photoperiod’s hours:minutes to total minutes.
Enrichment Using Data: Students might find it interesting to create a 
sequential x-y graph of photoperiod length versus day of the year so they 
can see how the photoperiod varies cyclically over the span of a year.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
The most difficult part of this activity for students is to calculate the 
photoperiod from the sunrise and sunset times. First, they will need to 
convert these times to military time, because we have a 24-hour day but 
use a 12-hour clock. When subtracting the sunrise time from the sunset 
time, students must borrow from hours to minutes in six, 10-minute 
blocks, not the normal base-10 borrowing. Geography skills also can be 
a problem, and it would help for students to have maps and globes for 
reference.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, have students in different groups collect different 
data. To work with less data, students might only collect solstice data 
to compare the longest and shortest days or might compare fewer 
locations. Mathematical shortcuts can be used; for example, using a 
time calculator such as the one on the Timeanddate.com Date and Time 
Calculator website (www.timeanddate.com/date/timeadd.html).

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Scaling Up
For added complexity, have students work in teams, with different groups 
collecting data for the equinox and the winter solstice for comparison. 
Allow students to use cities of their own choosing at different latitudes 
rather than the cities on the handout. Students can research some of the 
cities at similar latitudes to see how their climates vary based on other 
factors, such as precipitation and ocean currents.

Analysis Questions
1.	 How different are the photoperiods at different seasons where you live? What date was the 
longest? The shortest? How much difference was there between them?
2.	What is the relationship between latitude and photoperiod on the summer solstice?
3.	Which location in Data Table 2 has a June 21 photoperiod closest to the photoperiod where 
you live? What city has the closest latitude to your location’s?
4.	In what ways do you think photoperiods are different in the winter? Collect some additional 
data for cities both north and south of the equator on the winter solstice (December 21) to 
test your hypothesis, and then explain what you discovered.
5.	In what ways do you think photoperiods are different in the spring and fall? Collect some 
additional data for cities both north and south of the equator on the equinox (March/
September 21) to test your hypothesis, and then explain what you discovered.
Conclusions
Based on what you know about Earth’s tilt on its axis, create a model (for example, an 
annotated illustration) that describes why days are longer in the north during the summer.
Reflection Question
How does the amount of incoming solar energy in each location vary over a year because of 
the seasonal changes in the photoperiod?

Background 
Information
Seasonal changes on Earth include not only temperature and 
precipitation variations, but also changes in the amount of sunlight 
each day. Days are much longer during the summer than during the 
winter. The view of Earth from space show that because Earth tilts on 
its axis, the part of the planet that is receiving sunlight during the day 
varies according to location and season. During the equinoxes, the solar 
terminator (the line between day and night) is vertical, whereas on 
the solstices, it is curved toward the pole. Viewing the changes of the 
solar terminator across seasons can help students to better understand 
seasonal changes in solar energy on Earth.

DATA AND TECHNOLOGY (continued)
Technology 
Notes
The USNO website has a responsive design and will work well on small 
devices. However, it does not illustrate the current position of the Sun. 
The graphics produced on the Timeanddate.com website and Day & Night 
Map app include the current position of the Sun. The app uses a slider bar 
or calendar to select the date and time.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: No sampling issues anticipated.
Data Type: The data for most comparisons are the nominal (that is, 
unordered category) data type. Distance values are given in millimeters 
(mm).
Data Issues: Measurements made on a larger screen size might not fit 
on the graph. In that case, either use larger graph paper or a divisor to 
reduce all values to fit on the provided graph.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
The view produced on both the app and the website is centered on the 
prime meridian. Students should understand that the map projection is 
a distorted view and that Earth is spherical. The USNO website allows 
students to see the spherical view as an alternate; however, the graphic 
produced does not allow for manipulation.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, take screenshots for easy comparison rather than 
having students illustrate each view.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, add a Moon-phase correlation. The TimeandDate.com 
website and Day & Night Map app both show the positions of the Moon and 
the Sun. Students can use their relative positions to predict the phase of the 
Moon for each date, and then verify using a Moon-phase app or the USNO 
Phases of the Moon website (http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/MoonPhase.
php).

USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY (continued)
Extending
Image Processing: By calibrating the images with known distances, 
students can measure the distance between the Sun’s northernmost 
and southernmost positions on the solstices. For this activity, students 
can work with “Image J” software— free, downloadable software for 
processing screenshots, available from the National Institutes of Health 
website (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij)
Lahaina Noon: In Hawaii, Lahaina Noon is the time of year when the Sun 
passes directly overhead. This happens twice a year—once as the Sun 
journeys north and again on its way south. Have students research on what 
dates these occur, and then view those dates on the TimeandDate.com 
website or an app. They can then use the TimeandDate.com website to 
identify other dates and locations of the Sun at its zenith, and mark those 
locations on the map.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
A clear pattern should be evident. On the equinoxes, the terminator lines should be nearly 
parallel, north to south. On the solstices, the terminator should curve with the North 
Pole being entirely in daylight during the (Northern Hemisphere) summer and the South 
Pole being in total daylight during the (Northern Hemisphere) winter. Check to see that 
student measurements are reasonable, being nearly the same length during solstices and 
progressing differences during solstices.

Analysis Questions
1.	 What is the shape of the solar terminator on Earth during the summer and winter? How 
does this compare with its shape on the equinox shape?
2.	Is the Sun ever straight over your head where you live? If so, when? If not, what is the 
closest it gets, and when?
3.	What does the change in the Sun’s position at different seasons suggest about the amount 
of incoming solar energy at different latitudes?
4.	The distance you measured between terminators represents the length of the shortest and 
longest day for each season at a particular latitude. During summer, how does day length 
compare in the northern and southern hemispheres? During winter?
5.	What does the pattern observed on the equinox suggest about the length of the day in 
different locations on Earth?
Conclusions
Use what you know about how Earth tilts on its axis to construct an explanation for why the 
solar terminator is curved.
Reflection Question
How do the images you collected model the seasonal changes in sunlight at different latitudes 
during the year?

Background 
Information
As planets in the solar system orbit the Sun, their position changes 
relative to the background of stars, which appear to be locked in position 
within their designated constellation. Scientists use local coordinates 
(azimuth, altitude) to specify a planet’s position relative to the Earth’s 
surface as it moves across the sky; however, scientists use a different 
coordinate system—right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec.)—to 
indicate the fixed position of stars on the celestial sphere, that is, their 
position relative to each other. Right ascension is the equivalent of 
longitude on Earth’s surface, running pole to pole. Declination is the 
terrestrial equivalent of latitude, indicating the position of a star above or 
below the celestial equator. A planet’s RA and declination will reveal its 
current position relative to its background of stars.

Technology 
Notes
When accessing data on the USNO website you will use the Form A 
for U.S. locations and Form B for non-U.S. locations. The website has a 
responsive design and works well on small devices.
About the 
Data
Data Sampling: Data sampling will be relatively straightforward, because 
students are collecting current-position data using celestial coordinates 
and rise and set times.
Data Type: The location data is nominal (the planet positions are all 
independent from each other); however, instead of graphing, students 
will be locating the position of the planets on a “map” of the celestial 
sphere.
Data Issues: Retrograde motion for planets can result in unexpected 
differences between two dates.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
In this activity, students will identify the current position of planets along 
the ecliptic. Students should have an understanding that the ecliptic is 
an extension of Earth’s orbital path around the Sun, which all planets 
stay near as they orbit the Sun, and that the zodiac constellations are 
the constellations through which the ecliptic passes. Using data for 
the current position and the rise and set times for the Sun, the Moon, 
and each of the five naked-eye planets, students can determine when 
and where to look for each of these planets in the night sky. Students 
who struggle with latitude and longitude might have problems with 
plotting RA and declination and will need group practice before working 
individually.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, have students work in pairs or small groups to 
find the information for a single planet, then work as a large group to plot 
the positions of the planets on a class chart. Alternatively, students can 
use sky maps such as are on the Lunaf website (http://lunaf.com/space/
sky-map) and the Sky Marvels website (www.skymarvels.com/infopages/
solarsysteminfo.htm) to find the location of each planet in the zodiac 
constellations without using RA or declination. With this method, students 
must view sky maps from different continents to see the full ecliptic.
Scaling Up
For added complexity, students can use the change in celestial motion 
over the 30-day period to hypothesize about where each planet will be 
after a year. Then, they can use the topocentric data from the USNO 
Topocentric Configuration of Major Solar System Bodies website to check 
the closeness of their predictions.
Another option would be to focus on the daily movement of the Moon 
over one month. How does its movement compare with that of the 
planets?

Extending
Star party! Borrow some binoculars or telescopes or invite a local 
astronomy club to hold a star party. Have students locate the visible 
planets within each constellation along the ecliptic.
What’s my zodiac sign? Have students determine where the planets will 
be on their birthday. They could draw a star chart indicating the position 
of the Sun and planets on their special day, as well as figure out their 
zodiac sign.
Enrichment Using Data: Students can work with local coordinates 
(azimuth, zenith distance), apparent magnitude, and other information 
provided with the topocentric data to explore patterns over time while 
the planets orbit the Sun.
ASSESSMENT NOTES
When plotting the current position of each planet, declination should put the planets near 
the ecliptic. Venus and Mercury will always be near the Sun. Celestial bodies that are closest 
to Earth will generally move the most across the sky over the 15-day period; however, 
planets that are moving retrograde (apparent reverse motion) might not appear to move 
much at all, or might appear to move backward, and could affect any assertions students 
make.

TEACHER NOTES: HIDING OUT
Learning Goal
Students will examine the biotic and abiotic features necessary for 
survival of an organism by developing a plan to go into hiding for a year 
in a remote place that would provide the conditions to support life. There 
is no student handout for this activity.

•	 Stability and change
Background 
Information
Animal organisms need to find places to live 
that allow them to avoid predators, find shelter, 
and obtain adequate water and nutrition daily. In 
this exercise, students will consider where they 
could go and what they would need to “escape 
humanity” for a year (as a group of 10) and survive. 
The starting point is using a map of airline flight 
patterns over the mainland United States to 
determine areas where they (and any indicators of 
their existence) could best remain out of sight of a 
plane (which is an analogue to a predator). Then, 
they will construct an argument about meeting the 
other necessities in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.

Notes
This open-ended project asks students to think about what data they 
need, then choose the websites and/or apps to find those data. Some 
of the websites listed have a responsive design, and most have an app 
alternative. Technology issues will vary, depending on the sites and/or 
apps students choose. The teacher might challenge students to share 
useful apps that can be applied to new investigations.
About the 
Data
Students will be expected to support and defend their argument using 
data and graphs about relevant factors, for example, weather patterns, 
water availability, and the ability to grow crops.
USING AND ADAPTING THE ACTIVITY
About the 
Activity
This activity is designed to allow students significant freedom in their 
explorations (Tamir, Level 3; see Table 3.1, p. 28). It is a very open-ended 
activity in which students are expected to accumulate an array of 
resources (including data from various government and nongovernment 
websites) that they will then use to construct an argument about the 
best location for a group of 10 of them to hide away and be unfindable 
for at least a year. The teacher can establish a list of items they might 
take with them, but the students must attend to the various things that 
humans need to survive and must determine the best remote spot in the 
United States where all of their survival and secrecy needs will be met. 
It is possible that people will be looking for them, so they must choose a 
spot away from both roads and planes flying overhead (as per the flight 
tracking website or app). Teachers might want to create a rubric with 
specific criteria, or they might have students help establish guidelines 
and construct a rubric for project evaluation.
Scaling Down
To simplify this activity, shorten the list of needs students must meet, 
expand the list of resources they can take with them, and decrease the 
size of the groups.

Scaling Up
For added complexity, lengthen the list of needs students must meet, 
lengthen their time in hiding, and shorten the list of resources they can 
take with them.
Extending
Add Extreme Weather: Tell the students that, given the current pattern 
of extreme weather affecting the United States (possibly driven by 
climate change), they must plan to deal with extreme weather events (for 
example, higher tides, decreased rainfall, or increased snowfall) as part of 
their exercise. 
Individual Versus Group? Would it be easier or harder to do this activity 
as an individual, rather than as a group? Which needs in Maslow’s 
hierarchy would be easier to meet as an individual? Which would be 
harder? What do you think the optimum size of a group would be if going 
into hiding for a year or more? Why do you think this?
ASSESSMENT NOTES
Because this is a completely open-ended activity, teachers should identify key 
expectations of students in their projects. Ideally, the students will work with the teacher to 
collaboratively develop a rubric for the final product.

BEYOND THE DATA
T
hroughout this book we have mostly focused our investigations, whether using 
real-time and archived data, on two things: (1) using “stored” numeric data (that 
is, previously created variables) so that students sample already-available data sets 
to conduct their own research and answer their own questions from it, and (2) having 
students create their own variables and constructs from available information to repurpose 
it to answer new questions about new variables. Although we believe that doing this type 
of science investigation work develops students’ science literacy—and given that second-
ary data analysis is a time-honored research method in science—these activities are still 
typical science activities in that students are collecting data, conducting data analysis, and 
constructing arguments from those activities, and are then writing conclusions about them 
using some form of science report.
However, the utility of science and its findings extend far beyond the areas in which 
scientists (and science students) work, and often extend into areas of interest to the public, 
where it can form and shape public policy. Given this, another science activity and skill 
we consider quite important is having students write about science findings and conclu-
sions for readers who are not terribly scientifically literate on many issues—essentially, the 
general public. Even scientists themselves are now being encouraged to write about their 
research work for the general public, and many colleges and universities have developed 
science-communication programs and degrees to improve the communication of science 
research findings to nonspecialist audiences. So for us, an important aspect of science lit-
eracy, and one that we want to develop in our own students, is the ability to understand 
the findings of science and then to communicate that information to people with less of a 
science background through less-formalized communication strategies.
As teachers, we have also noted that students appreciate some variety in their writing 
tasks, so in this chapter we have included some activities that involve writing about the 
science data found using small devices (apps and/or websites) for different audiences 
and in different ways than for the previous activities. We would like to suggest that you 
consider using activities like these when you have an opportunity to, because research 
suggests that students write differently (and often better) when they are writing for an 
audience other than a teacher.
These sorts of nontraditional writing activities can take many forms. Students can use 
the information on the websites we have highlighted here to create posters and trifold

brochures, write a children’s story (to teach someone much younger about the science 
behind an important issue), create a play, make a video for internet viewing, write an 
article for a newspaper, and so forth. This sort of activity also develops generic communi-
cation and literacy skills, so a science teacher might consider collaborating on an activity 
with another teacher (such as the art or language teacher)—an important consideration 
given that some schooling jurisdictions have a strong focus on math and literacy skills 
these days. What follows are a few ideas for using small devices to develop big ideas.

REAL-TIME CITIZEN SCIENCE
T
he use of bring-your-own-technology (BYOT) is not limited to independent investiga-
tions using real-time data. There are a number of ways in which students can partici-
pate in the language and culture of science by collecting and sharing real-time data 
within a larger scientific community. Citizen science projects offer opportunities to participate 
and collaborate in real science experiences and add to ongoing investigations. According to 
Silvertown (2009, p. 467), “A citizen scientist is a volunteer who collects and/or processes 
data as part of a scientific enquiry”. Citizen science projects are investigations designed by 
professional scientists that provide a role for amateur scientists. They are designed to pro-
vide educational benefits for the public as well as make scientific progress toward a project’s 
goals. These projects are different from the work being done exclusively by scientists in that 
they are open to the public collection of data. Citizen science projects are an “ideal opportu-
nity for science novices to become familiar with the process and culture of science and even 
to become engaged participants in the scientific enterprise” (Fenichel and Schweingruber 
2010). Citizen science projects are not new. China has more than 1,200 years of cherry blos-
som data and more than 3,500 years of data on locust outbreaks. A more-modern example of 
an ongoing citizen science project is the Christmas Bird Count, an ongoing project that has 
been sponsored by the National Audubon Society (www.audubon.org) every year since 1900 
(Silvertown 2009). Not only do these projects encourage public participation in data collec-
tion, but their records are freely available online.
Involvement in citizen science projects can have lasting effects on people who take part 
in them. Participating in citizen science projects can also lead to increased interest in science 
and changes in identity as volunteers begin to see themselves as part of a larger scientific 
community (Fenichel and Schweingruber 2010), which is certainly true from the authors’ 
perspectives. In the early 2000s, Donna participated in a summer workshop that included 
making observations for the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) 
(www.aavso.org). This organization was established in 1911, and for more than a century has 
collected observations from amateur astronomers around the world to monitor variable 
stars. Variable stars change magnitude and can tell us much about stellar evolution and 
our universe. Some types of variable stars have changes in magnitude that are very quick 
and can be observed in a single evening, whereas others have cycles that are decades long. 
Over the course of a single summer workshop, Donna collected data in an investigation 
that not only deepened her understanding of both science content and how science works,

but also cultivated in her a life-long love of astronomy. Involvement in citizen science 
projects has lasting impact.
The internet has increased participation in citizen science projects because it now is 
easier than ever for scientists to reach out to the public and promote participation. This 
outreach has been a positive feedback loop, with the increased participation by the public 
then helping scientists to realize the general public is a wonderful, free resource for data 
collection. Because of this, scientists are creating even more opportunities for citizen sci-
ence involvement in their work. Massive data sets have been collected, much larger than 
any scientist could collect alone, and within a geographically broader area (Miller-Rushing 
et al. 2012). Other factors that have led to the increased number of opportunities to par-
ticipate in citizen science projects include the emphasis on public outreach in all National 
Science Foundation (NSF)–funded grants (Silverton 2009). 
Educators who want to use citizen science projects in their classrooms “can engage 
learners in science while immersing them in science content and scientific practices” 
(Nugent et al. 2015, p. 35), and will find a multitude of projects to choose from for any 
content area. There are five general characteristics of a good citizen science project to look 
for (Silvertown 2009) in assessing projects:
1.	
A way to validate data: It is important that a scientist who wants to use data 
collected by the public can determine that the data are valid. Once data are entered 
into a project, they should be verifiable by a scientist within the project. This can 
happen in a number of ways. Images and geotags can be collected with data, and 
observations can be made using smartphones. Another means is to have multiple 
volunteers that analyze the same data; for example, identifying features on images.
2.	
Having standardized and well-designed methods: For data to be valid, all 
participants collecting and sharing those data should understand the protocols. 
Some projects include a training component. For example, the AAVSO has a 
training manual. Clemson University’s Firefly app has a tutorial to help novices 
learn what data to collect and how to collect it.
3.	
Explicit assumptions: Any assumptions included in the investigation must be 
clearly communicated because the scientist usually will not be available to answer 
questions. A detailed FAQ (frequently asked questions) document or detailed 
“About” section is usually provided on project-related websites and apps.
4.	
Tentative hypothesis to guide data collection: Although not essential for a 
successful citizen project, having a tentative hypothesis is helpful for those 
collecting data to see the big picture.
5.	
Feedback to volunteers who collect data: Feedback can come in many different 
forms. In some projects, such as Project Noah (www.projectnoah.org), participants

can participate in “missions” and earn “patches” that show they have collected 
certain types of data. Other projects include opportunities to be included in 
publications when discoveries are made. Donna knows at least one amateur 
astronomer who published findings in a professional journal from participation 
in the AAVSO project.
Citizen science projects do not typically include all five characteristics, but those that 
include at least some of these features are desirable.
ESTABLISHED CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECTS
Table 11.1 (p. 246) lists a variety of websites for citizen science projects. One of the 
most well-known citizen science projects in Earth science is the GLOBE project 
(Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment, www.globe.gov). This 
government-sponsored program has been around since 1995 and is managed by NASA. It 
is designed for educators, and teachers must be trained at a workshop before their classes 
can participate. This project sets a high standard for protocols and standardization of data-
collection methods, but provides teachers with in-depth lessons for implementation of their 
project in the classroom. Participating teachers can collect data for weather, soil, water qual-
ity, and various ecosystem indicators, such as land cover and mosquito-larvae counts. The 
training requirement for teachers assures that standard protocols are used in data collection. 
Because attending a face-to-face workshop can be inconvenient, some training modules are 
posted online. These are interactive video components that have required activities built in, 
to ensure thoroughness while teachers work through the modules. The emphases on train-
ing and protocols are important, because scientists use the data collected by teachers and 
students in real scientific investigations. Scientists are accessible to the students and teachers 
participating in the program, and they often collaborate with investigations. The GLOBE 
website has a responsive design and works smoothly on smartphones and tablets.
Another long-running citizen science program is Journey North (www.learner.org/
jnorth), which is sponsored by Annenberg Learner and has been ongoing since 1997. This 
project involves students of all ages in tracking and reporting different indicators of sea-
sonal changes. Journey North has developed an app to make reporting observations easy  
(Figure 11.1, p. 242). They are kid-friendly and provide information about the species included 
in their annual migration projects and other educational materials. Donna has experience 
with this program and been a fan since its early days. Projects include tracking migrations 
of hummingbirds, monarch butterflies, and American robins, as well as other seasonal indi-
cators, such as tulip blooming and the first run of maple syrup. One of Donna’s favorite 
projects is the Mystery Class activity, because of its interdisciplinary nature. This project runs 
each spring and is designed as a classroom activity in which students analyze multiple types 
of data, learn to calculate photoperiods, and use clues to identify 10 different mystery cities 
at different latitudes. The project is centered around the vernal equinox, so students see how

photoperiods vary above and below the equator. Students collect and 
analyze data on how the photoperiod changes at their own location 
as seasons change, and learn map and globe skills in a multicultural 
activity while using clues to identify 10 specific locations around the 
world. Donna has found that this activity is engaging and appropriate 
for students of all ages, and has used some variation of the project with 
elementary, middle school, and high school students over the past two 
decades. Regardless of which project you collect data for, the data col-
lected as part of all projects are shared on the website and available to 
you. Collecting data on seasonal changes in this way has become more 
popular with the increasing importance of climate change in science.
The JASON Project (www.jason.org) is another long-running citizen 
science program that has been around for decades. Established in 1989 
by Dr. Robert Ballard as an outgrowth of his Titanic expedition, this 
program is sponsored by National Geographic and now a fully devel-
oped curriculum project. Sponsorship of citizen science activities is 
just part of their portfolio. Real-time data projects include Budburst, 
which monitors seasonal changes, and the World Water Monitoring 
Challenge, in which students monitor water quality and report find-
ings to a world-wide database.
CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT COLLECTIONS
One of the most well-known online forums for authentic, citizen science research is  
Zooniverse (www.zooniverse.org), and one of its longest-running projects is Galaxy Zoo, 
in which the public has helped classify images of galaxies since 2007. Although there are 
few opportunities for students to collect real-time data in these projects, participants are 
involved in processing visual data collected by scientists in authentic investigations. These 
projects are exciting in that scientific discoveries are continuously being made thanks to 
the help of the public. More than four dozen professional papers have been published from 
the efforts of this project. Other projects in the Zooniverse include identification of bat 
calls, studies of chimpanzee behavior, and identification of plankton.
Another great collection of citizen science projects can be found at SciStarter (http://scis-
tarter.com), which began in 2010 and links interested citizen scientists to more than 1,100 
projects in all fields of science (Figure 11.2). Funding for this project comes from the NSF 
and other public and private supporters. What Donna likes best about SciStarter is the abil-
ity to search for projects by content area or location of data collection (for example, home, 
car, or beach.). It also has resources online to help teachers select the right projects for 
their students and identify which projects include curriculum materials. The SciStarter  
database of projects is shared with the Public Broadcasting Service (see pbs.org) (PBS), the

National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), 
Discover Magazine, and many other broadcasters 
and publishers of science content. They are the 
ultimate resource for finding and locating proj-
ects to use in the classroom.
The Lost Ladybug Project (www.lostlady-
bug.org) is one project to which SciStarter 
links (Figure 11.3). This citizen science proj-
ect asks participants to identify and share 
images of ladybugs, which are used to track 
native and non-native species. The website 
provides educational materials that are suited 
to elementary-age students. The activities 
include lesson plans, handouts, reading lists, 
and other materials perfect for development 
of an integrated teaching unit. Participants 
in the project take geotagged photographs 
of ladybugs, add comments about the local 
habitat, and upload them to the project. Submissions are confirmed 
with the observer by email. An app can be downloaded, allowing for 
mobile participation, or data can be submitted directly from the app. 
Students can explore the current geographic range of sightings for 
different types of ladybugs, add to those data, and compare them to 
the 1985 geographic range for each species. This project is ideal for 
even the youngest citizen scientists!
The quantity of citizen science projects available for participation is 
too great to even begin listing here, and that landscape is always chang-
ing. Some projects are phasing out as goals are reached, and others are 
starting up each day, as scientists increasingly recognize the potential 
of public participation in real-time data collection. The chances are very 
good that whatever topic your class is studying, there is an opportu-
nity for the students to participate in authentic science investigations 
through any number of projects. Alternatively, you could design your 
own projects for online or smartphone data collection outside the class-
room or, through online resources, you can participate in other real-time 
citizen science projects designed by other teachers.

BUILDING YOUR OWN PROJECT
As you continue collecting your own real-time data, you might decide you would like stu-
dents to be able to collect and report data using their own devices. You might want to limit 
these data to what your students collect, or possibly decide to collaborate in real-time inves-
tigations with other classes. Such collaborations can provide broader results and can be used 
to compare the effects of phenomena at different locations. A number of online resources 
make it possible to set up and share data-collection programs easily. These citizen science 
applications are still fairly new, having been around only a few years. The websites might not 
be as stable as those of established projects shared in the Citizen Science Project Collections 
section, and might still need fine tuning to make them easier for students in classrooms to 
use. We expect to see more of these opportunities develop in the coming years, with these 
and other sites finding a stable niche in the online citizen science community.
CitSci (www.citsci.org) is one such resource that not only hosts hundreds of existing citi-
zen science projects, but also allows teachers to create their own. Projects can be accessed 
on the web or through the CitSci app. This program was developed at Colorado State 
University by their Natural Resources Ecology Lab, with funding from the NSF. Although 
we found that some projects on their site lack the information needed for full participation, 
CitSci would be a viable option for the classroom teacher who wants to set up a project for 
students and collaborate with others.
A similar resource is Aecern (www.aecern.com), whose partners include the Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institute, the Kaput Center at the University of Massachusetts, and Sana 
health care. Their website is exciting in that many of the projects designed either become 
stand-alone apps or are integrated into existing general apps for students to collect and 
report specific data. Teachers can choose existing projects to assign or create their own for 
student data collection. To start using this website, you must first set up a classroom account 
and either choose an existing project or create a new one. As the teacher, you add the stu-
dents to your account and specify the data you want students to collect. All members of the 
class share the same account. The teacher must use a personal identification number when 
logging on to access the teacher section of the account. Once a project has been assigned, 
students can collect and submit their data. Teachers then have access to those data through 
the website. 
Small World Data (http://smallworlddata.com) is a relatively new site developed by Donna’s 
software-engineer husband for her to create authentic projects to use with her students. We 
can guarantee it will be around until she retires! This responsive-design website is ideal for 
using within a web browser or as a web-based app (Figure 11.4). It was built for teachers to 
develop projects for students to collect and share data in real time. Teachers create an account 
and set up new projects or collaborate with existing ones, and can upload complete lesson 
plans to share with colleagues.

In Small World Data, once a project has been assigned, a QR 
Code can be generated and posted for students or printed in their 
lesson plans. Students can scan the QR Code to enter data on their 
device or log into the website to report their data. Data can be geo-
tagged and/or have images added. Teachers and students then 
can download a spreadsheet containing the data collected in the 
investigation to use for analysis. This website was developed with 
collaboration in mind so that teachers can share data synchro-
nously or asynchronously with each other, regardless of location.
Such build-your-own-project websites are fairly new on the 
citizen science scene, but demonstrate a trend toward authentic 
engagement in collaborative science investigations. Most of their 
developers are genuinely interested in facilitating meaning scien-
tific investigations for students and teachers, and are likely to be 
helpful when teachers reach out for help. Their websites and apps 
are also more likely to evolve over the coming years as demand for 
these types of projects increases.
As authors of a book that refers to websites and apps, we offer 
this reminder that websites appear and disappear every day, and 
this could happen with some we have mentioned. Should this 
occur, please remember that new opportunities will emerge in 
their place and can often be found with a simple internet search.
Whether you decide to involve your students in real-time investigations using data col-
lected by another source or have them collect their own data, we feel that you and your 
students will find these authentic learning tasks meaningful and become more engaged in 
exploring Earth and environmental science. In addition, we hope that as a teacher, you will 
also find other new and exciting real-time data resources to use in your classroom.

BIG  DATA
SMALL DEVICES
INVESTIGATING THE NATURAL WORLD  
USING REAL-TIME DATA
“As a classroom teacher with a background in instructional technology, I found 
smartphones and tablets to be the perfect devices for having students access real-
time data for classroom investigations. I began using these in my own room, then 
started sharing ideas at teacher conferences. What I immediately found is that there 
is a great deal of interest in using personal technology devices as learning tools.”
—Donna Governor, co-author of Big Data, Small Devices
Given the number of students with smartphones and tablets, it only makes sense for 
them to take advantage of the many websites and free apps that can teach them about 
the natural world. Big Data, Small Devices is designed for Earth and environmental 
science teachers who want to help students tap into, organize, and deploy real-time 
data sets. Students can learn to use their devices to detect patterns among phenomena 
related to the atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and celestial sphere.
Written by veteran teachers, Big Data, Small Devices will help you understand both the 
technology you need and the ways to use it in classes at all levels, from elementary school 
through high school. The authors give tools, tips, and tricks for finding real-time data 
and using them to create your own investigations. Then, they provide sample activities 
that showcase specific data, as well as the websites and apps that provide them. You 
can use the activities as written, adapt them to your specific needs, or use them as 
inspiration for creating your own.
Big Data, Small Devices is a one-of-a-kind book for developing investigations with any 
data accessible online. It also helps you bring learning opportunities for your students 
as close to them as their personal technology devices.
