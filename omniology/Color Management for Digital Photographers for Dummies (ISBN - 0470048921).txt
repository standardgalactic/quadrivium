About the Authors
Ted Padova ﬁrst began his interest in amateur photography as a Peace Corps
volunteer in Venezuela. He toured ﬁve Latin American countries, collecting
shoeboxes of slides he hopefully will one day sort out. Upon completion of
his two-year Peace Corps tour, he attended the New York Institute of
Photography in Manhattan when it was a resident school, earning a diploma
in Commercial Photography.
In 2004, he retired from his Digital Imaging Service Bureau and Custom Photo
Finishing Lab after 15 years of owning and operating three facilities. He has
authored over 25 computer books on Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop,
Adobe Photoshop Elements, and Adobe Illustrator. Today, he spends his time
writing and speaking nationally and internationally on Acrobat PDF and digi-
tal imaging.
Don Mason is a graduate of Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara,
California. He has been a professional photographer for more than three
decades and works in virtually every aspect of commercial photography. Don
ﬁrst started using a computer in 1999, when he didn’t believe that digital
imaging would ever replace his wing lynch system used for processing all his
E-6 ﬁlm and his darkroom where he made his own C-prints. After 4 years of
intensive work in Adobe Photoshop, he abandoned his analog ﬁlm lab and
went completely digital. Today, he divides his time shooting professional
commercial photography and printing art prints for a wide range of clients on
his two, oversized Epson inkjet printers.

Introduction
You rarely find a photo you can take with a digital camera or scan on a
desktop scanner that doesn’t need some kind of brightness, contrast, or
color correction. Taking pictures with your camera is only half of your job
when you want to print pictures or host them on the Web. The other half of
your job is editing in your digital darkroom.
In this book, you can find out how to get color just right by setting up a digi-
tal darkroom in your home (or wherever you work on your digital photos)
and using the plentiful and robust tools in Photoshop Elements to correct
tone and color.
About This Book
In this book, we try to provide a comprehensive view of tone and color cor-
rection, using the tools available in Photoshop Elements versions 4 and 5. We
stick to what Elements provides you in the application without using third-
party products designed to overcome limitations in the program. What
Elements offers off-the-shelf is all you need to create the pictures you want
with proper brightness, contrast, and color.
Who This Book Is For
If you’ve had problems getting brightness and color correct on your pictures,
this book is for you. This book is also meant for Photoshop Elements users.
If you’re a Macintosh user, you’ll find this book equally as helpful as Windows
users do. We use screen shots from the newest release of Photoshop Elements,
which is available only in Windows, as of this writing. However, just about all
the techniques, the dialog boxes, and almost all tools are the same in a Mac’s
Photoshop Elements 4 as those found in Window’s Photoshop Elements 5.
If you’re a Photoshop user, we recommend our book Color Correction For
Digital Photographers Only (Wiley Publishing) rather than this one because in
this book, we limit the coverage of color correction to working with Photoshop
Elements.

2
Color Management for Digital Photographers For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
We point you to menus where you’ll frequently access commands throughout
the book. You need to know how to decipher the references for where to go
when we detail steps in a procedure. First off, you need to know how we
show accessing a menu command. You might see something like this:
Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin Tones
When you see commands such as these, we’re asking you to click the
Enhance menu to open that menu, then click the menu command labeled
Adjust Color to open a submenu. In the submenu, select the Adjust Color for
Skin Tones command. Many of the menu commands we talk about then open
a dialog box where you perform your editing.
Another convention we use relates to using keystrokes on your keyboard.
When we mention some keys that you need to press on your keyboard, the
text looks like this:
Shift+Ctrl+M (Shift+Ô+M on Macs)
In this case, you need to press the Shift key, the Control key in Windows (the
Ô key on a Mac), and the M key at the same time. This keyboard shortcut
opens the Adjust Smart Fix dialog box.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into logical chunks (parts). Chapters that discuss
related topics are grouped together in five different parts.
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing
The first three chapters in the book are devoted to understanding color, cali-
bration, and the essentials you need to do to prepare your color editing envi-
ronment. We talk about terms and concepts you need to know for any kind of
color correction and tonal editing. Be certain you understand the concepts in
these three chapters and, in particular, make sure you get your monitor cali-
brated for proper color viewing.
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections
In almost all cases, color correction begins with tonal corrections. In the
three chapters in this part, we talk about all the methods you have available

in Photoshop Elements to get the proper brightness and contrast in your pic-
tures. As you can discover for yourself, doing these corrections first makes
the job of color correction much easier.
Part III: Color Corrections
This part relates exclusively to color correction, and it’s by far the largest
part in the book. We cover color correction techniques for a wide variety of
image problems related to color reproduction. You can find out all that
Elements has to offer for professional color-correction methods, and we
avoid using menu commands and tools that just don’t measure up when you
want to create quality images.
Part IV: Finishing Work
This part is limited to color printing. We talk about what you need to do to
get your output to look like your monitor and how to print your pictures with
color profiles. We cover several, common, consumer-grade printers and how
you print your files to these printers.
Part V: The Part of Tens
We wrap up the book with the Part of Tens chapters, where you can find 
tips for better tone and color corrections. After you gain experience with
Elements and the techniques in this book, if you become curious about
upgrading to Photoshop, we provide a chapter that offers an overview of
Photoshop’s additional features for correcting brightness and color.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins throughout this book, you see icons next to key paragraphs.
These icons indicate some important information in the text they accompany.
Here are the icons and their meanings:
Tips tell you how to use an alternate method for a procedure, shortcut, or
workaround, or they give you other helpful information related to working on
tasks in the sections in which they appear.
Pay particular attention when you see the Warning icon. This information
tells you when you may have some problems performing your work and how
to avoid those problems.

Color Management for Digital Photographers For Dummies 
This icon gives you a heads-up about something you may want to commit to
memory. Usually, it informs you of a shortcut or a repetitive task, where
remembering a procedure can save you time.
No matter how hard we try to simplify our explanations of features, we can’t
entirely avoid the technical. If we think something is complex, we use this
icon to alert you that we’re moving into a scary, technical subject. You won’t
see many of these icons in the book because we try our best to give you the
details in nontechnical terms.
When you see this icon, the text it’s next to includes a reference to a file on
the companion Web site for the Color Management for Digital Photographers
For Dummies book. Log on to www.dummies.com/colormanagement, and you
can download files that we uploaded to help you follow some important
steps. If you have a little time, visit the Web site and download all the files so
that you have them ready to use when you see this icon in a chapter.
Where to Go from Here
The first part of this book involves the basics of color, and it’s the foundation
for all the remaining chapters. Try to spend a little time going through the
first three chapters in Part I. Next, be sure to thoroughly review Part II. You
need to become familiar with tone and brightness corrections before moving
on to color correction. After reviewing Part II, feel free to jump around the
color correction chapters.
If you have some questions, comments, suggestions, or complaints, send

We wish you much success and enjoyment in using Adobe Photoshop
Elements for tone and color corrections, and we sincerely hope that the infor-
mation in this book helps you produce better pictures.

Part I
The Basics of
Color Editing

In this part . . .
You need to walk before you can run. In
Photoshop Elements terms, you need to
know some basics about color and calibration
before you can start color correcting photos.
In this ﬁrst part, we talk about some essentials
to help you fully understand all the parts ahead.
Chapter 1 gives you some basic understanding of
color, how Photoshop Elements sees color, and
some fundamental principles to follow in all your
color work. You can ﬁnd out how to best set up
your workspace’s light for image viewing in
Chapter 2. Chapter 3 focuses on color calibrating
your monitor — the most critical step for you
to perform when preparing for color editing.
In Chapter 4, we move on to managing color, and
we also look at color proﬁling and how you use
proﬁles.

n order to manage and correct color photos, you need to understand a few
things about how your digital camera, your computer, and your printer
handle color. The tools you use to create your photos capture and display
color in a consistent manner. Although not the most exciting aspect of cor-
recting an image for proper color viewing, the basics of color and how your
devices deal with color is an essential ingredient to producing better
color photos. In this chapter, we cover some essentials of color
that you need to know as you work through all the other
chapters in this book.
Understanding Calibration Basics
Throughout this book, we talk about working in a
good color-management workflow. Developing such
a workflow begins with the essentials — setting up
your work environment, getting your monitor in
shape, and using your color desktop printer properly.
In this book, we talk about some sophisticated measures
to help you best view, edit, and print color images. In some
cases, you may think that some recommendations and tips we
offer are a bit more than you want to do when you edit your own pictures.
If you’re not ready to change your work environment, you need to make some
decisions about what you can realistically do to prepare your environment
and your computer as best you can to effectively edit photos.

8
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
One thing to keep in mind is that the more preparation steps you cut out of
your color-management workflow, the farther you move away from accurate
color reproduction. Therefore, you may decide to eliminate some things that
we consider critical to preparing your work environment; but realize that you
can’t expect to achieve the most accurate color in your photos.
We tried to write this book in such a way that you don’t need to read it cover
to cover, but even so, you do need to work through some essentials in order
to dive into Elements’ Standard Edit mode and begin editing your pictures.
You can’t avoid these essentials — you need to address them before you
begin image editing. To prepare your work environment and set up your com-
puter for good color management, you need to do some preliminary tasks:
 Controlled lighting: One of the most commonly overlooked areas
related to good color-viewing conditions is carefully setting up your
viewing environment. If you work on a super professional color monitor,
have your monitor tweaked with a $5,000 color calibrator, and use the
most sophisticated color profiles, you’re only halfway to managing color.
If light coming through your window and from your overhead light fix-
tures results in a colorcast on your monitor, you’re not working in an
optimum viewing environment. The first consideration you need to
make is controlling the lighting of your workplace. We cover setting up
lighting in Chapter 2.
 Monitor calibration: You’ve heard it all before, and we repeat it here —
you need to be certain your viewing device reflects the best possible
brightness and gray balance that you can get. On the low end, you can
purchase some inexpensive calibration equipment; on the high end, you
can purchase some very sophisticated calibration tools. At some point,
you need to use a device to get your monitor to display the best it can,
in terms of brightness and gray balance, as we explain in Chapter 3.
 Color profiles: You may have heard the term color profiles before. A
color profile is a small computer file that contains all the settings that
give you the best color capture, view, and/or print. If you don’t use color
profiles, your reproduction efforts are like taking a shot in the dark.
Color profiles are created through the process of calibration. Therefore,
you need to first get familiar with some of the steps used for calibration:
Color profiles are ultimately created from your calibration adjustments. In
many cases, you acquire color profiles with your hardware equipment —
especially color printers. You need to know when and how to create a
color profile and how to use color profiles supplied by hardware develop-
ers. We cover color profiles more in Chapter 3.

There you have it. Your first steps in color correction involve controlling
lighting, calibrating your monitor, and having all the color profiles you need
for editing images and outputting them either for Web hosting or printing.
After you have these essentials in place, you can begin the task of color 
correction.
Getting to Know the Language of Color
Color terms and definitions can be very confusing, but for this book, we use
the same terms and concepts that Adobe Photoshop Elements uses and
avoid all the fancy scientific stuff you really don’t need to know to edit your
images.
Color is defined by just three terms: hue, saturation, and brightness. In order
to make the concept of correcting color much easier to understand later in
the book, we also give you the definition of a complementary color, which
means the exact opposite (on the color wheel) of the color you’re looking at.
Stay awake because the following sections are really important.
Hue
Hue is the term used to name the actual color you’re looking at. Your eyes
perceive only three pure colors, but those three colors mix in your brain to
give you all the colors you actually see.
The human eye has special receptors called cones. Cones come in three dif-
ferent kinds, each sensitive to a narrow portion of the light spectrum humans
can see. One cone type responds to short wavelength light and sees blue.
One cone type responds to middle wavelength light and sees green. The last
cone type responds to the longest wavelengths and sees red. Our eyes’ three-
color cone design is why your monitor can show you millions of colors, even
though it projects light in just three pure hues: red, green, and blue. These
colors are known as the additive model.
Photoshop Elements works with color by mixing (adding) red, green, and
blue. You need to identify these hues in the same way that Photoshop
Elements does. Take a look at the color wheel in Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1 shows a standard, simplified color wheel. The colors are as close 
to the real monitor hues as we can show you in this book because of ink 
limitations.

Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Figure 1-1: This simple color wheel shows red, green, and blue hues.
The first thing you might question is the yellow patch, made from green plus
red. Keep in mind that you’re mixing light, not paint. Mix equal parts of red
and green light, and you get yellow. No, we’re not making this up! Your eyes
see yellow when something you’re looking at emits equal parts of green and
red light.
Still doubt us? Well, paint a yellow patch on your monitor in an Elements file,
then zoom in and look very closely at the monitor. The only colors you see
are little, glowing pixels of green and red. It’s counter-intuitive, but green and
red light make yellow.
Red
Yellow
(Red + Green)
Magenta
(Red + Blue)
Blue
Cyan
(Green + Blue)
Green

The next color that might confuse you is blue. It looks purple, you say? You
also might think that the cyan patch should really be called blue. Remember,
you’re mixing light, not paint.
Your kindergarten teacher is probably to blame for the confusion. Back when
you mixed paints in those long-ago classes, she showed you that blue and
yellow mixed together made green, and you probably had a pot of paint called
purple that looked like the blue patch on our color wheel.
Mixing paints to get different colors uses subtractive primaries. The subtrac-
tive primaries are cyan, magenta, and yellow. Your teacher probably called
them blue, red, and yellow. It made naming the paints a lot easier, but it
wasn’t really correct.
Equally mixing the red, green, and blue primaries create cyan, magenta, 
and yellow on your monitor, as shown on the color wheel in Figure 1-1. Just
remember that you need the basic hues of red, green, and blue to make a full
range of hues (or colors) on the computer.
Colors exactly opposite of each other on the wheel are called complementary
colors. Mix the complementary colors together on the monitor in equal parts,
and you get a shade of gray, light gray, or white. The complementary colors
cancel each other out. We talk more about this concept of colors canceling
each other out in Chapter 8, where we show you how to correct the color on
a bad image file.
Saturation
The term saturation defines the purity of a hue. Saturation is pretty easy to
understand if you look at a few examples, such as the ones shown in Figure 1-2.
The green patch in Example A is a highly saturated hue. In Example B, the
patch is the same hue but less saturated. In Example C, the patch is desatu-
rated more than B. Finally, in Example D, you see the same hue completely
desaturated and therefore devoid of color.
Saturation defines the vividness of the hue in question. Think of a desatu-
rated color as one with white, gray, or black mixed in. Gray represents a fully
desaturated tone — no color at all.
Brightness
Brightness means what it says: It’s the term used for how light or dark is the
hue in question. Keep in mind that a hue can be bright without being satu-
rated. Here’s an example: The three cyan patches in Figure 1-3 are equal in
saturation, but they vary in brightness.

Figure 1-2: A green patch shown at different levels of saturation.
Figure 1-3: These three cyan color patches vary in brightness values, 
from least bright on the left to brightest on the right.
(a) Highly saturated
(b) Less saturated than a
(c) Greatly desaturated
(d) Completely desaturated (no color)

We repeat these color concepts a great deal in this book as we work our way
through color management. Editing a file to change overall color, brightness,
and contrast often affects the hue, saturation, and brightness of the colors in
your file. Understanding how to define those changes can make the rest of
the book far easier to understand.
Color space
Throughout this book, we continually refer to the term color space. Color
space is a way to numerically describe color on computers. Color space is
also often referred to as a color model. RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) is a color
space. CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK) is a different color space.
HSB (Hue, Saturation, and Brightness) is a color space that describes color as
we define it in the preceding sections.
For most purposes, because Elements is limited in the number of color
spaces that you can view, we pretty much stick with the RGB color space
throughout this book.
Color gamut
Another term you find frequently used in this book is color gamut. Color
gamut is simply the entire range of color within a given color space. We might
use a phrase such as “outside the color gamut,” which simply means that a
particular color isn’t contained within the range of color for a particular
color space. As a result, you can’t see the color on your monitor, and you
can’t print the color on your printer.
You might have a color visible on your monitor because it fits within the
monitor color gamut, but the color may not print on your color desktop
printer. The color isn’t within the printer’s color gamut.
Clipping
Quite often, we talk about colors or tones being clipped, which means that
the value is cut off. A color that’s clipped, for example, won’t print. When
Elements prints a photo that has some color clipped, the print shows you the
closest color to the clipped value. Beyond that value, the clipped colors
aren’t printed.
Clipping also relates to image tones (or grays). If we say that a very light or
dark tone is clipped, for example, the print appears with some whites and
blacks lost. This loss of tone results in a loss of detail in highlights (whites)
and shadows (blacks).

Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Suppose you took a picture in which the foreground subject is in the sun. In
the background, your eyes see a beautiful range of shaded trees. When you
print your photo, the leaves on the trees aren’t completely visible. They look
dark and don’t have much detail. The dark tones were clipped (cut off) from
the image.
Mixing Colors
Your computer monitor is capable of displaying a total of 16.7 million distinct
and individual colors. The monitor is capable of showing you all these colors
by mixing the primary hues of red, green, and blue together. Understanding
how your monitor mixes the colors ultimately helps you understand how to
edit your pictures for color correction.
Imagine a diaphragm similar to your camera’s diaphragm. You can turn the 
f-stop ring to open or close the diaphragm. As you open the diaphragm, you
let more light pass through the lens. If you could close a diaphragm all the
way on a lens, you would block all light from passing through the lens.
When your monitor displays a color, it allows certain amounts of light to pass
through the RGB color phosphors in a similar fashion to a camera lens. The
monitor can control the amount of light that passes through the phosphors
in 256 individual steps. It’s like having a ring on your camera lens with 256
separate adjustments.
In computer terms, 0 (zero) is a number; therefore, the 256 value is really
measured from 0 (zero) to 255. If you assign 255 to the red hue and 0 (zero) to
the green and blue hues, you see a fully saturated red color on your monitor.
To test this theory, follow these steps:
1. Open any file in Standard Edit mode.
2. Double-click the mouse cursor on the Foreground color swatch in the
Tools palette.
The Color Picker dialog box opens.
3. Set the color to a fully saturated Red.
Type 255 in the R text box in the Color Picker. Type 0 (zero) in the G and
B text boxes, as shown in Figure 1-4. These numbers mean that you open
the diaphragm all the way for the Red channel and close it all the way
for the Green and Blue channels. The result is a fully saturated red color.
(For more on channels, see the section “Understanding channels,” later
in this chapter.)

Figure 1-4: The Color Picker identifies a fully saturated red color.
Understanding grays
The number of distinct settings you have for color mixing are commonly
called levels of gray. Because the computer monitor doesn’t have a diaphragm,
you need some method for controlling the amount of light that passes
through any one of the three RGB phosphors.
Try to visualize a large plate of glass. If you paint the glass solid black and
place a light behind the black glass, zero light passes through it. If you then
paint a glass plate 50 percent gray, some light passes through the glass. As
you reduce the level of gray to smaller percentages, more light passes
through the glass, resulting in more saturated color.
Hence, in Photoshop Elements terms, you have 256 levels of gray that permit
you to increase or decrease the saturation on the three individual hues.
Remember when we said that your computer monitor can display 16.7 million
distinct colors? We got this number by multiplying the maximum number of
grays for each hue together (256 × 256 × 256 = 16.7 million). This number
really means that you have 16.7 million combinations of levels of gray with
which you can create colors.
15
Chapter 1: Understanding Color

Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Understanding channels
In Photoshop Elements terms, the three hues your monitor displays (red,
green, and blue) are called channels. You can easily see the three channels by
opening an RGB color image in Standard Edit mode and opening the Levels
dialog box. Select Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels or simply press Ctrl+L
(Ô+L for Macs). When the Levels dialog box opens, click the RGB menu (the
down-pointing arrow), and you see the three channels, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-5: In the Levels dialog box, you can access the three RGB channels.
We commonly refer to the RGB channel as the composite channel because it’s
a mix of the different gray levels in all three channels. If you make an adjust-
ment to this channel, all three RGB channels are adjusted together. However,
you can also individually make adjustments to the Red, Green, and Blue 
channels.
When we refer to making adjustments to either the composite channel or the
individual channels, we’re really talking about painting that imaginary glass
darker or lighter to allow more or less light to pass through, resulting in more
or less saturated color.
As you work through the chapters in this book, we continually reference tone
levels (represented by the 256 levels of gray) and channels. A slight edit to
the tone levels in either the composite channel or any one of the individual
channels can greatly affect image brightness and color.

Why are there 256 levels?
This 256 number comes up a lot when talking about image modes. What
makes it so special?
Reproducing tone on paper or a monitor requires a minimum of about 200
tone levels to give smooth results without banding (or making sharp transi-
tions between) the tones in smooth gradient image areas. Some images can
get along with far fewer levels of tone, such as highly textured images or
those that don’t really contain any smooth tones.
Two hundred tone levels is a kind of minimum benchmark for good results.
So why 256 levels and not exactly 200? It has to do with the way computers
calculate. Computers use binary math, and 8-bit encoding allows exactly 256
tone levels. Seven-bit would result in just 128 tone levels. So, 8-bit mode
became the minimum standard for full tonal range image files.
The 256 tone levels of 8-bit mode also allow a little headroom for file editing.
Image editing always causes some amount of information loss, and as a direct
result, an edited 8-bit file always has less than 256 real tone levels remaining.
The extra 56 levels allow more editing before any tone banding problems
become visible.
Understanding Color Modes
A color mode is a fancy term for the method Elements uses to display and
print your image. Elements allows you a choice of four different color modes.
And although Elements doesn’t support the CMYK mode, it can convert a
CMYK-mode file to a mode it does support.
RGB
You’ll probably use RGB, Elements’ standard default mode, 99 percent of the
time. This mode uses three channels (Red, Green, and Blue) to describe color
and tone. This mode is the most versatile and gives you access to all the edit-
ing tools and filters in your Elements application. RGB files allow embedded
color profiles (which we talk about in Chapter 4).
Index color
This is an ancient color mode in the computer world. Unlike RGB 24-bit
mode, with 16.7 million possible colors, index color allows only 256 colors.
This mode was originally created back in the old days as a means to keep
17
Chapter 1: Understanding Color

18
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
color file sizes as small as possible. Computers couldn’t display 16.7 million
colors back then, so monitors that showed images in only 8-bit mode used
index color.
Web pages still use index color today, in the form of GIF-format files that are
limited to 256 colors. The Save for Web option in Elements allows you to save
files in the GIF format, if you want.
The main advantage to the GIF format is the ability to keep graphic elements
clean and sharp on Web pages, unlike JPEG files, which can add distracting
visual artifacts to graphics when the JPEG files use high compression set-
tings. But index color doesn’t allow the use of color profiles.
Grayscale
You can think of grayscale as the black-and-white image mode, in terms of
black-and-white photos. Just a single channel is used to describe image tone
without color information. Grayscale has 256 distinct gray levels supported
in 8-bit mode and more than 40,000 gray levels in 16-bit mode.
Grayscale mode has advantages if you like to work with classic black-and-
white photography. Grayscale files are just one-third the size of an RGB file,
so you get much faster computer performance and can store more files on
your hard drive.
If you want to tone, paint, or tint a grayscale creation, you must convert to
RGB mode to do so.
Grayscale supports embedding special profiles to indicate the display
Gamma used and also for dot gain if the file is for traditional press use.
Bitmap
Bitmap is a 1-bit file format. One bit means that only two tone values are 
supported — just white and black with no grays. Bitmap can simulate gray
values by using a display we call dithering, which places the black and white
pixels in a pattern to visually appear as grays.
Elements users should probably see bitmap as more of an image appearance
than as a standard file format to use. The main advantage to this mode is the
small final file size, compared to grayscale mode. Convert a grayscale file to
bitmap, play with the options available for conversion, and you might find a
visual style that you like.

CMYK
You can’t edit in this mode, but Elements does allow you to open a CMYK
color mode file that Elements converts upon opening to RGB mode so that
you can work with the image.
CMYK is the color mode used for traditional printing press reproduction of
color images. For example, this book was printed from CMYK-mode files.
Printing presses need to use four separate ink plates to reproduce full color
images on paper. The press plate colors are cyan, magenta, yellow, and black,
so it’s called CMYK mode. (Black is abbreviated K because, a long time ago,
people were afraid that using B for black might be confused with blue.)
CMYK supports embedded color profiles. (We talk about color profiles in
detail in Chapter 4.)
Converting Color Modes
In some situations, you need or want to convert one image mode to another.
You may need to convert a grayscale or bitmap file to RGB so you can col-
orize, paint, or tint the image for output to a color printer. If your file’s in
bitmap mode, you must convert first to grayscale and then to RGB mode. You
can make these conversions by selecting Image➪Mode and then selecting a
color mode from choices in the submenu that appears.
In other situations, you may need to convert from RGB mode to index color
mode for Web use. Sometimes, you need to make a mode conversion from
index color to RGB so you can edit the file for color or tone, before convert-
ing it back to index color mode.
Follow these tips when you make image mode conversions for editing:
 To allow full editing capabilities for an index color file, convert the file to
RGB mode, edit it, and convert it back to index color mode.
 If you plan to create multiple images for use in index color mode, keep
your original files in RGB mode and convert duplicates. You can’t
recover the information you lose when you convert RGB mode to index
color mode.
 You have to convert bitmap mode to grayscale mode in order to edit the
tones of the image. You can convert back to bitmap when you finish edit-
ing in grayscale mode.
19
Chapter 1: Understanding Color

20
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
 Grayscale mode has far more editing options than bitmap mode. It’s best
to keep master files in grayscale mode and convert to bitmap mode as a
final step before viewing or printing the file.
 If you want to convert RGB to grayscale, always convert a duplicate file.
All the color information is lost when you convert a file to grayscale
mode.

orrecting color in digital images requires you to optimize your working
conditions for the best possible viewing environment, as well as make
sure all your equipment is calibrated properly. Getting color precise with
absolutely no discernible differences isn’t completely possible when viewing
color images on monitors and printing photos on a wide range of output
devices. Therefore, what we strive for is to control the variables as much as
possible to bring our color viewing and printing together as close as we can.
If you skip one variable in the process, you move just a little farther away
from an ideal color-matching system.
In this chapter, you take the first step toward controlling
those variables — creating the optimal lighting in your
workspace. Accurate and consistent color editing
requires full-spectrum lighting, with a color tempera-
ture reasonably matched to the monitor color tem-
perature setting so that both the viewing area and
monitor view are consistent with one another.
Most quality, full-spectrum lighting used today
involves fluorescent-type lighting fixtures that use
special lamps with a sophisticated phosphor mix that
yields a full, white-light spectrum.
We realize that the average amateur photographer who takes
occasional snapshots of the kids and makes a few prints after hol-
idays and special occasions is not likely to turn the bedroom into a
color work studio. The results you want depend on how much you want to
invest some money and energy in creating a solid workplace designed for

22
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
color-correction work. We give you the whole nine yards here and in Chapters 3
and 4, where we cover monitor calibration and color profiles, and you can pick
and choose what changes you want to make in your workplace. Hopefully, you
know that if you cut a lot of corners and you expect to do quality color work,
you’re not likely to achieve the best possible results.
Understanding Color Temperature
We could have titled this section “What Color Are Your Whites?” In the com-
puter world, white is a relative value.
Your eyes and brain are constantly at work adjusting what you see to let you
perceive a pure white when you find it. This is why you can move from a
department store to the great outdoors and not notice the change in lighting
color from one place to another.
Unlike a camera, we tend to see colors as normal no matter what kind of light
is illuminating a scene. Set your camera to daylight balance, however, and
that department store interior most likely photographs with a strong, yellow-
green colorcast from the indoor fluorescent lighting. Your eyes see no cast at
all. That’s because your brain figures out a real white point and adjusts your
internal white balance in an instant — pretty amazing.
This property of your eyes is very important when it comes to editing images
on a monitor and viewing the resulting print outputs. You see, your eyes can
adjust to only one viewing environment at a time. Why is this important?
Well, if you have a monitor set to one white balance and your viewing area
has a different white balance, images on them look different to your eyes
because your brain can adjust for only one situation at a time. We have to try
our best to match the monitor whites to our viewing area whites. If we don’t,
a perfect printer output looks like a mismatch to the monitor.
The term used to define white balance is called color temperature. In simple
terms, average daylight has a color temperature of around 5,000 degrees
Kelvin. The term has to do with the color of light from very hot objects like
the sun. That’s why 5000K is a kind of standard for neutral white.
However, as we said, white is relative.
When determining a white point for a monitor, the final setting you use
depends on trying different, white-point monitor settings in the actual place
you’ll be using the monitor. As the color temperature increases, the white
tends to look bluer. Set your monitor white point to 6500K, and then to 5000K,
and you’ll notice right away that 5000K looks much more yellow than 6500K.

However, remember that the lighting of the room impacts the way you per-
ceive color on your monitor, too — which is why it’s important to start set-
ting up your color-management work area by making the room’s lighting as
close to daylight as possible before moving on to calibrating your monitor,
which we explain in Chapter 3.
The best possible lighting for viewing should be daylight balanced, which
requires lights in the 5000K to 6000K color temperature range.
Using Balanced Lighting
Balancing lighting is an attempt to make the quality of your indoor light as
close to natural daylight as possible. With different light bulbs in studios and
homes, the balance of your ambient light varies farther away from natural
daylight, although the extent of this variation depends on the light sources
influencing your environment.
The color quality of light is rated as the CRI (color rendering index) in per-
centage values. A CRI of 100 percent is a perfect match to natural daylight,
although the best lamps available are rated around CRI 98 percent — a very
close match to natural daylight. A standard, cool-white, fluorescent lamp 
has extremely poor color quality and is rated at about CRI 60 percent. Full-
spectrum lights fit in standard fluorescent fixtures and are also available in
the new Spiralux form that fits in a standard light bulb fixture. By checking
this rating when you shop for light bulbs, you’ll have a better idea what bulbs
can help create an environment that’s as close as possible to natural daylight.
Ideally, the Kelvin rating (color of the lamp) should match closely to your moni-
tor’s color temperature setting. A 5000K lamp (daylight balance) should, ideally,
be used with a 5000K monitor setting. We find that the lamps seem a bit cooler
(bluer) in color than the same monitor setting, at least on a CRT monitor, so
we use 5000K lamps with a 5500K monitor setting. Your mileage might vary
depending on your monitor and available natural light in your studio.
Prices for these lamps are usually about three times or more higher than prices
for inexpensive, cool-white lamps. The good news is that they last for years,
and some are very reasonably priced. Don’s studio uses standard, 96-inch fluo-
rescent fixtures that are fitted with Sylvania Sun Stick lamps that are rated at
5000K and a CRI of 92. Cost is about $8 per tube. You can find Sun Stick lamps
at your local home improvement store. The homemade viewing booth, shown
in Figure 2-1, uses a pair of 48-inch Triten 50 full-spectrum tubes. Color temper-
ature is 5000K, with an awesome CRI of 98 percent. Cost per tube is $6. To 
purchase the Triten 50 full-spectrum tubes, visit www.1000bulbs.com. This
vendor also stocks Spiralux full-spectrum lamps. Just look for Full Spectrum
links on the vendor Web site.

Figure 2-1: A homemade, color-correction workplace.
Keeping the lighting consistent is important. The lighting in a room with large
windows varies a great deal during the day. For viewing purposes, a win-
dowed room should have good curtains or shades to keep ambient light
levels consistent at all times. Visual monitor calibration is based on the view-
ing environment. In a windowed room without shades, monitor calibration is
like a broken clock — it’s always correct once a day!
Going for Neutral Gray
All the nice, balanced lights you purchase don’t mean much if you put your
monitor against a bright, yellow-and-orange wall. What you need is an area
encased in a neutral gray environment. To make this happen, you have a
number of options. If you’re serious about color management and have space
dedicated to the task, we suggest creating your own viewing booth. However,
if you need a more makeshift solution, check out the “Employing viewing
booth alternatives” section a little later in this chapter.

Building a viewing booth
For a makeshift viewing booth, follow these steps:
1. Purchase an 18 percent gray card.
You can find 18 percent gray cards at photo suppliers. Just ask a sales
person for a gray card or shop online at photo suppliers. A good online
source for all your photographic needs is www.calumetphoto.com. 
You can also use a QPcard like the one shown in Figure 2-2. These 
cards have a neutral gray as well as a black and white patch you can 
use when photographing scenes. You can purchase the cards at Calumet
Photographic as well.
2. Purchase a paint that matches the color of the gray card.
Take your 18 percent gray card to your local paint store and ask for a 
flat paint that matches the color of your gray card when the paint dries.
Most hardware and commercial paint stores are happy to provide
exactly what you need.
Figure 2-2: The center patch on a QPcard is an 18 percent gray.

3. Construct your booth.
Using particle board or unfinished plywood, construct the booth so that
it surrounds the viewing space around your monitor. You might paint the
unfinished wood or particle board before assembly.
4. Touch up the paint.
It’s not a piece of fine furniture, but you might spruce it up a little with
some touchup paint if you paint the material before assembly.
5. Set up your monitor.
If you have a CRT monitor (which is a television-type of monitor), you
can cut a hole in the back of the booth (see Figure 2-3) and push the
monitor back to provide more surface area for your keyboard.
Figure 2-3: A monitor’s viewing booth with space for a CRT monitor.

Employing viewing booth alternatives
A viewing booth is ideal for photo editing, but here are some tips for your
viewing environment if you feel a viewing booth is overkill for your needs.
 Get a piece of gray foam core board and place it behind your monitor in
your viewing area. Having a neutral value in your field of vision helps a
great deal. You can store the gray board when you’re not using it.
 Cover your working surface with a neutral material, especially if your
desk surface is a bright color. It doesn’t have to be gray, although gray is
best. A white tablecloth is fine for this. You can even place a second
piece of gray foam core board on the viewing surface.
 Add some daylight-balanced Spiralux lamps to your existing light fixtures.
Just remember that keeping your viewing area devoid of competing color
makes image editing much easier.

Get rid of the swimming fishes
When you open a program like Photoshop
Elements, you’ll notice the default background
color in the Elements window is a neutral gray.
Software engineers set this color as a default
intentionally because neutral gray is the best
color to minimize any colorcasting problems
and visual perception anomalies when viewing
your color photos.
If you use a desktop color or image, you infect
your viewing environment with extraneous
color. This is most obvious when you minimize the
Elements window and see the desktop pattern
in the background.
If you’re serious about color correction, resist
the temptation to change your background from
anything other than a boring, neutral gray. It
doesn’t look as snappy as watching multicol-
ored fish floating across your screen, but it does
go a long way in helping you keep your visual
perception of color at an optimum.

alibrating your monitor is the second phase of setting up your color-
management environment, after you take steps to control lighting, which
we explain in Chapter 2. By calibrating your monitor, you ensure the color
temperature is as close to daylight as possible, not only so you see colors
more accurately, but also to ensure that the color temperature of your moni-
tor is balanced with your room.
What Is Monitor Calibration?
Your monitor needs to be calibrated so that it accu-
rately displays the colors contained in any given
image. You calibrate your monitor by adjusting a
number of different variables, which may include
the following, depending on your monitor and the
tools you use to calibrate:
 The balance of colors on your monitor: This bal-
ance corrects any color tints or colorcasts.
 Brightness: The brightness control historically adjusts
the black point, which is the darkest point on the monitor.
 Contrast: Adjusting contrast used to mean adjusting the white point,
which is the lightest point on the monitor. As you calibrate your moni-
tor, you need to experiment with different monitor white-point settings
until the white of the monitor looks as pure as possible.

30
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
 Gamma: Gamma is the brightness of mid-level tones in an image.
In technical terms, Gamma is a parameter that describes the shape of
the transfer function for one or more stages in an imaging pipeline.
 White balance: You adjust the white balance setting to try to get the
brightness as close to natural daylight as you can.
You have a few choices for what tool you can use to adjust your monitor
brightness:
 Expensive calibration equipment that can cost $3,000 or more
 A low-cost hardware device priced at less than $300
 Software tools provided by Adobe (or your OS developer) to set up your
monitor
We discuss how you use low-cost hardware devices and software tools in the
sections “Calibrating with Hardware Devices” and “Adjusting Hardware
Controls on an LCD Display,” later in this chapter.
Working with CRT versus LCD Monitors
Computer monitors come in two flavors — CRT (cathode ray tube) and LCD
(liquid crystal display). The CRT monitors look much like old TV sets, and
the LCDs offer a sleeker, thinner look. Each type has its pros and cons when it
comes to monitor calibration.
LCD monitors, although now more prolific and newer in the marketplace, just
don’t match the color clarity you find in CRT monitors. In addition to improved
color clarity, CRT monitors also cost much less than LCDs. As of this writing,
a Dell Trinitron 21-inch display sells for less than $200 at online reseller 
outlets — try www.tigerdirect.com. CRTs have their downside, however.
In addition to their large size, overall bulkiness, increased power consump-
tion, and the excess heat they produce, they’re becoming increasingly scarce.
Many CRT manufacturers have discontinued entire lines of CRTs in favor of
the newer LCD technology.
If you find a good value on a CRT monitor, find out when the monitor was
made. If you purchase an older, used monitor, it may have exceeded its use-
ful life. You can expect to get about three to five good years out of a CRT
before it starts losing definition and color clarity. We can’t give you a magic

formula, however, because monitors vary greatly in fidelity and life
expectancy. You can easily check the date a monitor was manufactured by
looking at the label affixed to the back of the monitor.
Because of the popularity of LCD monitors and the anomalies associated with
calibrating LCD displays, we thought we’d point out some real problems you
may encounter when trying to calibrate an LCD display with the visual (soft-
ware) calibration utilities for both Windows and the Mac.
The visual calibrators were designed with CRT displays in mind. LCDs differ
from CRTs in two fundamental ways:
 LCDs are much brighter than CRTs and have a much higher overall
contrast. Setting picture contrast to the highest setting on an LCD, as
instructed by the calibration utility, usually makes the picture far too
bright for the calibration utility to work properly.
 The LCD monitor controls work differently than CRT controls. CRT
brightness and contrast controls are part of the monitor hardware, just
like a CRT television set. The brightness control adjusts the black point,
and the contrast control adjusts the white point by varying the output 
of the electron guns. The same is true of the color adjustments.
An LCD (unless it’s a very expensive professional model) varies the
brightness and contrast by changing the internal monitor color Look Up
Tables (LUT) to change the monitor image. The backlight is always
bright — very different from a CRT.
We worked long and hard to create a foolproof way to visually calibrate an
LCD monitor. If you decide to use a visual calibration tool, check out the sec-
tion “Adjusting Hardware Controls on an LCD Display,” later in this chapter,
and you should get a result that matches your print outputs much more
closely than the monitor default settings. Just keep in mind that you need to
use a hardware calibration device for the very best results.
An LCD monitor that’s calibrated for print work always looks darker and
warmer in tone than with the factory default settings.
If you have an LCD monitor now, keep your eye on product reviews and 
current literature. The LCD technology is new and continually advancing.
Computer CRT monitors have been around for more than 25 years, with 25
years of continued research, development, and improvement. As time goes
on, we expect LCD monitors to advance and ultimately render even better
color clarity than the best CRTs of years past.

Calibrating with Hardware Devices
We skip the high-end costly devices and suggest that, at the very least, you
should make one valuable purchase for creating a monitor profile — a hard-
ware profiling system. (See Chapter 4 for more on monitor profiling.)
On the low end, you have some very affordable devices that go a long way in
helping you adjust your monitor brightness and color balance:
 ColorVision Spyder2express: This calibration system is one of the
newer devices on the market. For as low as $69, you can purchase an
easy-to-use, three-step device that balances the color on your monitor
and adjusts it for optimum brightness (for both Macs and PCs). This
device is receiving five-star ratings at online resellers, including
www.amazon.com.
 Pantone Huey Monitor Color Correction system: This new, low-cost 
calibration system can calibrate both CRTs and LCDs (and supports
both Macs and Windows). This unit retails for $88 and sells for $74.95 at
Amazon.com, as of this writing.
 GretagMacbeth Eye-One Display 2: For a little more money, you can
order this low-end calibration device with superb capabilities from
GretagMacbeth (www.gretagmacbeth.com) — a company that has long
been a leader in sophisticated hardware equipment for creating calibra-
tions and color profiles. This device costs $249, as of this writing.
Eye-One Display 2 is an easy-to-use profiling tool that works with CRT
displays, LCDs, and laptop computers. You attach the suction cup that
comes with your Eye-One Display 2 to your monitor (see Figure 3-1),
click a few buttons in the software application accompanying the hard-
ware, and Eye-One Display 2 eventually prompts you to save a monitor
profile. Your operating system automatically uses the profile you create
when you start up your computer. When the profile kicks in, your moni-
tor is balanced, using the settings determined when the device per-
formed the calibration.
If you decide to purchase the Pantone Huey or the ColorVision Spyder2express,
either device will give you the best possible result on an LCD monitor if you do
a rough visual calibration for monitor brightness and contrast before using it.
Look over our tips for visually calibrating an LCD monitor for brightness and
contrast with the built-in monitor controls (see the section “Calibrating LCD
monitors that have brightness and contrast controls,” later in this chapter) and
at least get your LCD monitor in the ballpark first.

Figure 3-1: The Eye-One Display 2 calibration device helps you create a monitor profile.
Adjusting Hardware Controls on an LCD Display
What do we mean by visual calibration? If you don’t purchase at least a low-
cost hardware calibration device, such as those discussed in the preceding
section, or you need to quickly color correct some photos of the family
reunion before your device arrives, you can use a software utility already
available on your computer.
On the Macintosh, the Mac OS X software Preferences provides you with 
a calibration utility called the Display Calibrator Assistant. On Windows,
Adobe provides you with the Adobe Gamma control panel when you install
Photoshop Elements. These software tools allow you to make visual monitor
settings as you work through steps in a wizard window.
33
Chapter 3: Calibrating Your Monitor

34
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Before you can use the visual calibration tools on a Windows machine or 
a Mac, you need to do a little work making some hardware adjustments.
Without making some hardware corrections, your software calibration tools
won’t get your monitor to closely match your printed output for color and
brightness.
LCD monitor controls vary a great deal. Some LCDs have full control of
brightness, contrast, white point, and color balance (using individual red,
green, and blue controls). Others have some combination of these controls,
and some offer only color-balance presets for the red, green, and blue con-
trols. In the following sections, we try to explain the best methods to use
when making hardware adjustments, in spite of the lack of consistency
among LCD-monitor makers.
We ran across a couple of Dell LCDs with just preset and RGB-slider controls
(that is, sliders that adjust the levels of red, green, and blue). Because a Dell
monitor of this type is a popular brand, we’ll start here. Many other LCD
monitors are limited to just these controls, too, so try to apply our example
of adjusting a Dell monitor to your brand. Here are the steps to follow:
1. Open the hardware adjustment
controls on your monitor, and
you’re presented with some-
thing like you see in Figure 3-2.
The monitor has no brightness
or contrast controls! Developers
continually rely on auto-
brightness and -contrast adjust-
ments, and many are eliminating
these manual controls on LCD
displays.
2. On the Dell monitor, navigate
to the Color Settings option
and open the adjustment 
settings.
You find options like those you
see in Figure 3-3.
On an LCD, you may have to
navigate through the controls
on your remote control device
or on the monitor.
Figure 3-2: You can adjust settings on a Dell
monitor by using these hardware controls.

Figure 3-3: You can make adjustments to the Color Settings on a 
Dell monitor.
The Color adjustment contains a limited series of presets and a user
preset with RGB controls. You don’t have a Color Temperature option on
this monitor. (For an introduction to color temperature, see Chapter 2.)
The Normal Preset monitor setting is a generic setting that seems to
adjust for the normal blue color bias of an LCD monitor.
3. Make note of the settings and close the Color Settings panel.
To get close to a proper gray balance, we need to mix less blue than
green and less green than red. Our monitor has a slight blue cast and is
much too bright at the default settings.
4. In Photoshop Elements, open the MonitorCalibrationFile.tif file
(shown in Figure 3-4) in Standard Edit mode.
We provide this monitor calibration file, MonitorCalibrationFile.tif,
in the Chapter 3 folder on the Wiley companion Web site for you to down-
load. (See the Introduction for details about the Web site.)
5. Size the image to about one-fourth of your monitor size by pressing
Ctrl+– (minus) to zoom out.
You want to make it easy to see but small enough to move around as
needed.
35
Chapter 3: Calibrating Your Monitor

36
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Figure 3-4: You can use our Monitor Calibration File to get your monitor looking just right.
6. Open the monitor Color Settings control (one of the LCD monitor con-
trol buttons).
7. Select User Preset and reduce the Red output to 75 percent.
We start with this setting because we need to cut overall brightness to
make sure the monitor’s appearance matches images you print from
your computer.
8. Using only the Green and Blue sliders, adjust the color settings to
obtain the best neutral gray that you can on the test file and
Photoshop Elements’ neutral gray background.
Placing a standard photographic gray card next to the monitor can really
help you determine a true neutral gray.
After you have the best gray, you’re now ready to use the visual soft-
ware calibration tool. If you have a PC, see the following section, “Using
Adobe Gamma.” If you’re using a Mac, jump to the section “Calibrating
with just RGB controls on a Mac,” later in this chapter, instead.
Using Calibration Software
After you adjust hardware presets, or if you have a monitor without hardware
controls, you can use software available from Adobe (installed with Elements
in Windows) or software installed as part of the Macintosh operating system to
calibrate your monitor. But remember, a hardware tool specifically designed for

calibrating your monitor is the best solution. However, if you don’t have a hard-
ware calibration device, using a software tool to calibrate your monitor is the
next best thing to getting the monitor brightness correct.
Using Adobe Gamma
The Adobe Gamma application has been around for some time. It was dis-
continued on the Mac version of Elements when the Mac OS X operating
system was introduced. However, on the Windows version of Elements, it
remains the software utility to use. Like the Macintosh Display Calibrator
Assistant (which we describe in the section “Calibrating with just RGB con-
trols on a Mac,” later in this chapter), Adobe Gamma enables you to figure
out proper monitor adjustments that you can eventually save as a monitor
profile.
To use the Adobe Gamma control panel device, follow these steps:
1. Open your Control Panel by clicking the Start menu and choosing
Settings➪Control Panel.
2. Double-click Adobe Gamma in the Control Panel folder.
The Adobe Gamma dialog box appears.
3. Select the Step-by-Step (Wizard) radio button and click Next. (See
Figure 3-5.)
Figure 3-5: Select the Step By Step (Wizard) radio button and click 
Next to begin the calibration.

Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
4. Type a name for your profile and click Next.
5. Adjust the brightness and contrast controls on your monitor (see
Figure 3-6) and click Next.
Follow the description in the wizard to make your monitor adjustments.
Figure 3-6: The Adobe Gamma Wizard helps you adjust brightness and 
contrast controls on your monitor.
6. On the pane that asks you to select the Phosphors for your monitor
from a menu, Custom appears as the default choice. Leave this setting
alone and click the Next button.
By default, Adobe Gamma supplies the Custom choice taken from the
default monitor profile.
7. On the Gamma settings pane, deselect the View Single Gamma Only
check box.
The pane displays individual Gamma adjustments that you can make for
Red, Green, and Blue. (See Figure 3-7.)
8. Place each slider in the exact center under each box, as shown in
Figure 3-7.
9. Return to the single Gamma view by selecting the View Single Gamma
Only check box.
Disregard the Red, Green, and Blue Gamma boxes that appear.

Figure 3-7: Place each slider in the exact center below each of the 
RGB boxes.
10. Place the Adobe Gamma dialog box next to the open monitor calibra-
tion file, so you can easily view both at once.
11. Select a Gamma choice from the Gamma menu. Select Windows
Default 2.20 for the Gamma, then click Next.
You arrive at a pane in which the Hardware White Point check box is
selected. This setting defines the general colorcast on your monitor. You
can choose a setting anywhere between 5,000 degrees Kelvin (which
gives your image a slight red cast) and 9,300 degrees Kelvin (which pro-
duces a cooler blue colorcast).
12. Set the Adjusted White Point to 5500K for now.
The monitor view becomes slightly warmer than the 6500K setting that
we normally use to match natural daylight. This setting relates to color
temperature, which we introduce in Chapter 2.
13. Click the Back button in the wizard to return to the Gamma adjust-
ment pane.
The test file and the Adobe Gamma Control Panel should both be visible,
as you can see in Figure 3-8.
39
Chapter 3: Calibrating Your Monitor

40
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Figure 3-8: Place the Adobe Gamma Wizard window next to the test file while you’re making the Gamma
adjustment.
14. Now, adjust the single Gamma slider in Adobe Gamma until the little
square above the slider seems to match the surrounding gray (be cer-
tain the box for View Single Gamma Only is selected).
Slightly squint your eyes as you move the slider back and forth if that
helps you distinguish shades of gray. If the monitor controls are near the
correct setting, the Gamma slider will wind up fairly close to center, but
place it where it needs to be to match the little gray square to the grid.
Look at the step tablet below the portrait images in the test file (the
grayscale gradient). Can you see all the steps from white to black? The
dark step to the left of the black step should separate from that blackest
step and look slightly lighter than black. All steps toward white should
be visible, with no steps merged together toward white. The portrait
images should have a normal brightness. The big gray patch in the
middle should look gray. In Figure 3-9, a monitor adjustment appears too
light on the left, too dark in the middle, and properly corrected on the
right side of the figure.
15. Click Next and Next again to arrive at an option to change the white
point for your working conditions from your hardware white point.
Leave the white point set to Same as Hardware and click Next.

Figure 3-9: A monitor adjustment, too light (on the left), too dark (in the middle), and just right (on the right).
16. Click Finish in the last pane, and the profile is created.
The profile is automatically set to make the adjustment to this profile
each time you start your computer.
Unless you get really lucky in the preceding steps, your monitor display still
doesn’t look quite right. You need to do some more work to bring the overall
brightness of an LCD monitor within a close approximation of your printed
output. Follow these steps to make the final adjustments:
1. Examine a test file on your monitor.
Ask yourself, is the final result too light or too dark?
If the black patches in the step tablet are merging together and the faces
on the test file look a little dark, you need to brighten the monitor.
2. Open the monitor RGB controls on your monitor and navigate to the
User Preset.
Menus and controls on your monitor may have different names, but you
should be able to poke around a little and find the right setting to make
the adjustments we outline in this list.
Don’t use the Red slider to adjust color balance. You have to use the Red
slider as your brightness control.
3. If your monitor calibration is too dark, begin by brightening the Red
slider. If the test file appears too light, you can darken the monitor set-
tings by moving the Red slider in the monitor controls 10 or 15 per-
cent toward darken.
Our Red slider was at 75, so we moved it to 85.
4. To maintain gray balance as much as possible, move the Green and
Blue sliders equal amounts.
Too light
Too dark
Proper brightness adjustment
41
Chapter 3: Calibrating Your Monitor

42
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
We moved the Red slider to brighten by 10 percent (from 75 to 85 on our
monitor). Just add 10 to both the Green and Blue sliders to maintain an
equal balance. If you’re darkening the monitor, subtract an equal amount
from the sliders, instead.
5. Open the Adobe Gamma dialog box (you can find Adobe Gamma 
in the Control Panel) and move to the Gamma pane by clicking the
Next button until you arrive at the Gamma adjustment. Readjust the
Gamma slider to match the solid square above the slider to the gray
surrounding it.
Reexamine the test file. Does it look better? Hopefully, you say yes.
6. Click Next through the panes and click the Finish button to save your
changes in the Adobe Gamma dialog box.
If the monitor brightness is still too dark, start by changing the Red
slider setting toward lighten (the test file turns pinkish) and match the
change on the Green and Blue sliders. The gray balance should return or
at least be very close. You can make adjustments in a similar way (just
reverse the directions you move the sliders) to darken.
7. Make your final fine adjustments to the color balance by using just the
Green and Blue sliders. Do your best to match brightness to the gray
card.
After you finish with your final color balance settings, you can make a
small final adjustment to screen brightness with the Gamma slider, even
if the little square doesn’t quite match the grid. Being able to see all of
the light steps toward white is most important of all.
8. After you finish adjusting the monitor controls for best gray balance,
check the big white patch on the test file.
Does the white look like a neutral, pure white, or does the white patch
have a blue or yellow cast? If you think the white doesn’t look quite
right, try resetting the Adjusted White Point in the Adobe Gamma utility
to a higher value, such as 6500K, for a cooler white or to a lower value,
such as 5000K, for a warmer white. Use whatever setting gives you the
best, cleanest white.
9. Save your monitor profile in the Adobe Gamma dialog box.
After you complete this process, don’t mess with the monitor adjust-
ment controls. Your profile is valid only with the monitor settings you
used to create it. You might want to make note of those settings, in case
the gamer in your family turns the monitor back to full brightness.
Calibrating with just RGB controls on a Mac
On the Mac, you use the Display Calibrator Assistant to calibrate your moni-
tor. To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. In Photoshop Elements, open the MonitorCalibrationFile.tif that
you can download from the Chapter 3 folder on the Wiley companion
Web site and size the image to about one-fourth of your monitor size.
You want to make it easy to see but small enough to move around as
needed.
2. To open the Display Calibrator Assistant, click the System Preferences
in the Dock, click Displays in the Preferences window, click the Color
option at the top of the dialog box, and then click the Calibrate
button.
3. Click the Expert Mode check box, as you see in Figure 3-10. Click
Continue to move to the next pane.
Figure 3-10: In the Display Calibrator Assistant, select Expert Mode.
4. Compare the test file to the display adjustment.
On the monitor display, place the open test file and the dialog box so
that you can easily view both at the same time. Ignore the instruction to
turn up monitor contrast and observe the black-point test chart. At the
same time, check the dark end of the step tablet on the test file.
The circle in the black-point reference window should look like a dark
ellipse, and you should see a slight separation in tone between the test
file’s step-tablet black patch and the dark gray patch to the right of it.
Depending on your monitor brand and viewing conditions, you might
43
Chapter 3: Calibrating Your Monitor

44
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
see a slight separation in tone of the two background patches surround-
ing the Apple when the darkest gray patch to the right of the black patch
in the test file shows a slight separation. (See Figure 3-11.) If in doubt,
use the test file as the final reference.
Figure 3-11: Verify the elliptical circle is visible in the Display 
Adjustment dialog box.
5. Adjust for the black point.
You need to get this setting (black point) just right. If the black-point set-
ting is too dark or too light, follow the adjustment instructions we use
for Windows platforms with similar monitor controls in the section
“Using Adobe Gamma,” earlier in this chapter, until you have the best
black-point adjustment you can achieve. If you have to err, slightly too
dark is better than too light.
6. Set the monitor brightness with the Red slider control.
7. Carefully readjust monitor gray balance with the Green and Blue 
sliders.
Okay, you have your monitor-view black point adjusted, and the gray
balance is correct. The rest is easy.
8. Click the Continue button, and you’re presented with the first of five
dialog boxes that say Determine Your Display’s Native Response. (See
Figure 3-12.)

Figure 3-12: Adjust the left slider until the Apple appears in the center 
of the grid.
This totally cool feature is unique to Macs. It allows the computer to pro-
vide very accurate tonal rendering of your file on the monitor.
9. Adjust the left-side Gamma slider until the Apple in the middle
matches the surrounding square as closely as you can get it.
Don’t change the setting of the right-hand Gamma box in any way in all
five of the native response dialog boxes!
10. In each of the dialog boxes, set the left-side Gamma as accurately as
you can and then click Continue.
11. In the dialog box that appears, called Select a Target Gamma, simply
select the Use Native Gamma check box (see Figure 3-13) and click
Continue to open the next pane.
The native Gamma of your LCD is probably in the 2.20 range anyway, so
leave it at the default.
12. In the dialog box that appears, select a Target White Point and dese-
lect the Native White Point check box.
Observe the big white patch on the test file. The white in the dialog box
is a good reference, also.
13. Move the Color Temperature slider until the whites on the monitor
look neutral — not bluish or yellowish. A good starting point on the
slider is 5500K, as shown in Figure 3-14.

Figure 3-13: Select the Use Native Gamma check box to leave the native 
Gamma as the default.
Figure 3-14: Set the white point to 5500K.
Step back a bit from the monitor if you’re not sure whether the setting is
correct. Having a piece of pure white printer paper near the monitor can
sometimes help to see a pure white setting.

14. Click the Continue button after you finish with the white-point 
adjustment.
The Administration Options dialog box appears.
15. Click Allow Other Users To Use This Calibration to set Administration
privileges and click Continue.
The last pane appears, in which you supply a name for your profile.
16. Type a name different from the original monitor profile, as shown in
Figure 3-15, and click Continue to save the new profile.
Make note of your final monitor RGB settings, just in case they’re
changed at a later time.
Figure 3-15: To save your profile, type a name and click Continue.
Calibrating LCD monitors that have 
brightness and contrast controls
Some LCD monitors have built-in contrast and brightness controls. These
controls make calibration far easier than it is with just RGB slider controls.
You can adjust black point, white point, and overall image contrast indepen-
dently from the monitor color balance.
This type of LCD monitor also usually includes a number of presets for over-
all monitor color balance. In many cases, one of the presets comes very 
close to a neutral color balance with good gray rendering. You just have to
47
Chapter 3: Calibrating Your Monitor

48
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
experiment a little with the settings and see what you find. If the presets
don’t work, you need to try a more fine-grained adjustment with the various
sets of sliders. The following sections step you through the process.
Starting with the presets
ViewSonic monitors have the kind of preset controls that often come with
this type of monitor, and we use ViewSonic as an example here for how to
make hardware adjustments. If you have similar controls on your monitor,
you can follow along closely. Follow the steps below to make your hardware
adjustments for color temperature:
1. Open the test file MonitorCalibrationFile.tif, which you can
download from the Chapter 3 folder on the companion Web site, with
Elements. Size the image onscreen to about one-fourth of the monitor
view so you can easily view it and move it around if needed.
2. Open your monitor control menu and select Color controls.
In Figure 3-16, you can see the controls we found on an inexpensive
ViewSonic LCD monitor. This low-end monitor has a nice range of 
controls.
Figure 3-16: Low-end monitors, such as View Sonics, have a nice 
range of hardware controls.
3. Choose sRGB, if you have the option.

The ViewSonic offers a number of options, including a mode called
sRGB. After we tried out all the other color presets, the sRGB preset
(Figure 3-17) came very close to a perfect neutral gray!
As a rule, an sRGB or 6500K preset tends to hit the closest to neutral
gray, but you might as well try them all while you’re at it.
Figure 3-17: sRGB on the ViewSonic is very close to neutral gray.
sRGB is actually a color-space profile, not a specific profile for a particular
monitor. When you find this setting on a monitor, it’s usually a good idea to
try it out before you try any other settings. The sRGB preset is an attempt to
set the monitor up for a 6500K white point and a decent gray balance. In
other words, if it looks good, use it!
If one of the monitor color presets gets you close to a neutral gray, proceed
to the following section. If none of the presets produce a good gray balance,
you have to use the User Color controls.
Adjusting the brightness and contrast
In your Monitor Color Control dialog box, the individual red, green, and blue
color controls can have many different names, such as Custom, RGB, User,
and so on. Look around until you find them. The custom color control may be
just a white-balance adjustment, sometimes called the Color Temperature
adjustment. If you have a monitor with only custom presets and a white-
balance adjustment, do the following:
49
Chapter 3: Calibrating Your Monitor

50
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
1. Adjust the white balance.
Find the preset with the best overall gray balance and then fine-tune it
as best you can by using the White Balance slider. Moves toward higher
color temperatures add blue, and moves to lower values add yellow.
2. If your monitor has RGB sliders, look at these settings and make note
of the positions.
In Figure 3-18, you can see the individual controls for R, G, and B on the
ViewSonic monitor.
Figure 3-18: Make note of the default settings for Red, Green, and Blue.
Monitors vary when you select this option. Sometimes, opening the
option makes the screen turn bluish because all the sliders are set to
100 percent. On some monitors, some kind of preset is in place when
you open the dialog box, and less change happens onscreen.
3. Adjust the R, G, and B sliders to obtain the best overall gray balance
that you can.
As a rule, you want to adjust by using just two of the sliders to avoid
chasing your tail. We advise moving just the G and B sliders to make the
adjustment. You can move the R slider slightly at the end for a final color
tweak, if needed. See the section “Adjusting Hardware Controls on an
LCD Display,” earlier in this chapter, where we talk about adjusting two
color values.
Using a photo gray card as a gray reference is a big help here. Place it
near the monitor and try to match the gray as best you can.

After you have a good gray balance, you need to set brightness and 
contrast.
4. With the test file open, set brightness and contrast to 50 percent.
In Figure 3-19, you can see the brightness and contrast adjustments we
made to our example ViewSonic monitor.
Figure 3-19: Some monitors provide you with hardware adjustments for 
brightness and contrast.
5. Examine the image for brightness.
Does the step tablet show all 21 steps, from white to black? Do the por-
trait images seem to be a normal brightness?
Note: Your LCD has far more relative visual contrast than the paper
example in this book, but the tonal relationships should be similar.
Closely observe the last two dark steps in the gray scale. If the last two
(or more) steps are solid black, you need to turn up the brightness con-
trol. Turn it up until step 20 on the test file looks just the slightest bit
brighter than the full black at step 21.
6. Examine the light side of the gray scale (the contrast).
Can you see all the steps to white? If step 2 on the test file (or more) is
merged with the white step 1, you need to turn down the contrast con-
trol. Turn it down until you can see all the white steps clearly, but not so
much that the portrait image looks too dark.
51

Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
7. Recheck the blackest steps. If steps 20 and 21 are merged again, turn
up the brightness a little bit until they just barely separate again.
Note: We’re not trying to drive you nuts, it’s just that the brightness and
contrast controls affect each other. Make fine adjustments until you can
resolve all the grayscale steps and the portrait has a normal density.
Some lower-quality LCDs have a hard time separating the last two black
steps when the white steps and portrait look normal. If five or ten min-
utes of adjusting attempts still can’t resolve those two pesky dark steps
when everything else looks normal, that’s probably as good as you can
visually calibrate your LCD monitor.
8. Readjust gray balance.
Make one last visual check of the gray balance. A few LCDs vary a little
in color balance after you make large adjustments to the brightness and
contrast controls. Readjust the gray balance, if needed. If you have
access to only a Color Temperature slider for this adjustment, just do
the best you can.
Calibrating monitors that have white-balance, 
brightness, and contrast controls in Windows
For Windows users, you use the Adobe Gamma utility after you adjust a moni-
tor that has controls for white balance, brightness, and contrast. For this
kind of calibration, follow these steps:
1. Open Adobe Gamma (which you can find in the Control Panel) and
set the Phosphors.
Set the Phosphors box to Custom if it’s not set to that already. Your mon-
itor values are preloaded to Custom by the generic profile that came
with your monitor.
2. Adjust the Gamma.
Set the Gamma to Windows Default 2.20
Now, carefully adjust the Gamma slider so that the little gray box in the
center matches the surrounding gray box. Squint and lean back from the
monitor if it helps you distinguish the shades of gray.
3. Set the white point.
Set the hardware white point to 6500K. That’s the native white point of
your monitor.
Set the adjusted white point to 6500K. If the test file white patch seems 
a bit too cool (blue), try the 5500K setting. Use whichever setting gives
you a white closest to neutral white.

4. Type a new name for your monitor profile in the final Adobe Gamma
pane and click Save.
You’re now ready to work on your photos in Elements!
Calibrating monitors with just white-balance 
controls in Windows
If you have only white-balance controls on your monitor to control color bal-
ance, and if your test file seems to be a little off from neutral gray, you can
use Adobe Gamma to adjust for proper gray balance. Just follow these steps:
1. Open Adobe Gamma (which you can find in the Control Panel) and
set the Phosphors to Custom if it’s not set to that already.
Your monitor values are preloaded to Custom by the generic profile that
came with your monitor.
2. Set the Gamma to Windows Default 2.20.
3. Set the hardware white point to 6500K.
That’s the native white point of your monitor.
4. Set the adjusted white point to 6500K.
5. Carefully adjust the Gamma slider so that the little gray box in the
center matches the surrounding gray box.
Squint and lean back from the monitor if it helps you distinguish the
grays.
6. Deselect the Single Gamma View check box, and you’re presented
with Red, Green, and Blue Gamma boxes.
The boxes are very close to the proper adjustment already, but you can
use them to get your monitor grays just right.
7. For the Red and Green boxes, do your best to merge the center color
boxes with the surrounding boxes by moving the sliders below the
respective colors.
Very small moves make very visible changes to the gray balance of the
test file.
8. Adjust the Blue slider by watching the test-file gray patch and adjust-
ing for the best possible gray.
If the test-file gray patch still seems a little off after you set the Blue
slider to the best adjustment you can determine, you can play with the
Red and Green slider settings a little more — just make very small
moves. Be patient and work until you have the best gray you can get.
53
Chapter 3: Calibrating Your Monitor

54
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
If you get the RGB sliders completely messed up, just revert back to the
single Gamma view, reset the Gamma adjustment there, deselect Single
Gamma View, and start over.
9. Check the white patch on the test file. If the white seems too cool
(blue), try the 5500K setting on the adjusted White Point option. 
If the test file looks better, use that setting. If not, use the 6500K 
setting.
10. Type a new name for your monitor profile in the final pane and click
Finish to save the profile.
Calibrating Mac monitors that 
have white-point adjustments
Follow the steps in the section “Calibrating with just RGB controls on a Mac,”

I
n a nutshell, color management means keeping color consistent from the
image that you capture (on a digital camera, for example) to how that
image looks on your monitor and then to how it looks when you finally print
it. In practice, you can achieve consistent color by changing the image data
in a controlled way to keep the perceived color the same at all steps in the
digital photographic process. If it all works correctly, the scene you
photographed appears correctly on your computer monitor,
and the print you make looks just like the monitor view.
The key to this color consistency working correctly is
monitor calibration (adjusting monitor brightness and
color for correct viewing) and the use of color pro-
files for each device that you use to view or print
images. We cover the details of calibrating your
monitor in Chapter 3, and in this chapter, you can
find out the basics you need to know in order to add
profiles to your color-management workflow.
What’s a Color Profile?
A color profile is a little data set that tells the computer what color
the data numbers really mean. A computer doesn’t know what color really is.
The computer just reads numbers. For example, say you have a color you
know as orange displayed on the monitor screen. The monitor doesn’t have
any orange-colored phosphors or dyes in it, just red, green, and blue. To make
orange, the monitor has to light up a lot of red, a little green, and maybe even
a tiny bit of blue (if the orange you see isn’t super saturated). The monitor
needs to use even more blue and green if you’re looking at a pastel orange.

56
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Color profiles are commonly referred
to as ICC profiles. ICC stands for the
International Color Consortium. ICC
is a standards committee that regu-
lates standards related to color.
Color profiles are supplied to users
and created with color profiling
equipment that meets standards set
forth by the ICC committee.
So, the computer defines a particular
shade of orange as certain Levels
(amounts) of red, green, and blue.
To the computer, this orange color
might be: Red = 214 (bright); Green =
133 (medium); and Blue = 40 (dim).
Figure 4-1 shows the orange color
that these Red, Green, and Blue mea-
surements define.
The problem is, the computer has no
clue what the actual colors of the
monitor’s primary colors really are.
The computer also doesn’t know
how you’ve adjusted the monitor for
color and brightness. These same
numbers sent to a different monitor
might look like Figure 4-2. Both
patches are orange, but they look
very different.
This difference is easy to understand
if you visit your local TV megastore.
Find ten different TVs tuned to the
same station, and they all display
colors differently, even though
they’re all receiving the exact same
color numbers.
The color data needs an authority to
make the final call on what the color numbers really mean. That authority is
the color profile. If two different kinds of monitors are accurately calibrated,
and if each has its own custom profile, the computer for each monitor
changes the input data to make the color match, using the color profile as the
final authority. Therefore, two completely different monitors, hooked to two
different computers, can each display that orange patch exactly the same,
from the original computer file, if they’re color managed with color profiles.
Figure 4-1: You get this orange color with the
values R=214, G=133, and B=40.
Figure 4-2: This orange has the same RGB
values as Figure 4-1, but it’s viewed on a
different monitor.

Understanding the Different Types of Profiles
As you put profiles to work, you might find it helpful to understand that you
use color profiles for three different sources. These sources are
 Monitor profiles
 Workspace profiles
 Output profiles
If there’s a monkey wrench in the color-management process, it’s differentiating
between a monitor color profile and a color working profile. In the sections
that follow, you can find out the basic purpose of each type of profile.
Monitor profiles
You get your monitor color profile by calibrating your monitor to remove any
colorcasts and obtain the optimum brightness on your monitor. We explain
creating a monitor profile in Chapter 3. The monitor profile is automatically
loaded by your operating system when you start your computer. You may see
a sudden change in your monitor brightness during your computer’s startup.
That’s because the brightness settings that you create in your monitor profile
may differ from the default settings.
Don’t be confused about loading a monitor color profile in Elements. You see
your monitor color profile among the other color profiles when you print
files. Don’t select the monitor color profile for any kind of viewing or printing.
It’s automatic, and your computer loads it at startup.
Workspace profiles
Your color workspace profile is a profile you choose when editing your
images. Color workspace profiles define how your image color translates
between different color monitors and viewing conditions. If, for example, you
want to exchange a file with another user, you embed (or save) your color
workspace profile in the file. The recipient of your file may use another color
workspace, in which case, he or she might convert your image from your
color workspace to his or her workspace. Through this conversion, you
(and the person you send the file to) maintain as much of the same color
from your original workspace to the converted color workspace.
Photoshop Elements, the image-editing program we focus on in this book,
offers two options for a color workspace profile: sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998).
(Other editing programs might offer more or different options.) Before you
choose an option, it’s helpful to know that the workspace provides you a
view of the optimum color gamut (color range). The Adobe RGB (1998) color
57
Chapter 4: Color Profiles and File Formats

58
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
profile shows you a larger color gamut than sRGB (meaning more colors are
visible when you use this profile), but specific desktop printers and service
centers may prefer sRGB. We talk more about using sRGB over Adobe RGB
(1998) in the section “Working with Workspace Profiles in Elements,” later in
this chapter.
Output profiles
You use output profiles with printing equipment. When you print a file, a
color conversion takes place. The conversion is made from your workspace
color to the colors that your printer can reproduce. In essence, this conver-
sion attempts to convert all the color you see in your photo to as close a
match as your printer can reproduce.
You can manually or automatically select these profiles for your desktop
printer and the paper you print to, or you can get profiles that are custom
created by either you or a profile creation service. For the details on working
with output profiles, see the section “Managing Print Colors with Output
Profiles,” later in this chapter.
Working with Workspace Profiles in Elements
An embedded profile is simply the authority that tells the computer what
colors the file data really represent. Embedding a profile means saving the
profile along with the image that you save to your hard drive.
Unfortunately, Photoshop Elements affords you only two options for profile
embedding — sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). You can embed profiles in an
image file only when you select certain file format options. In addition, you
need to define your color workspace prior to saving the file so that the profile
is recognized in the Save/Save As dialog box.
In the sections that follow, you can find out the basics of choosing your color
workspace profile and embedding it in an image.
Defining your color workspace
Photoshop Elements provides you with two primary color workspaces
when you install the program. To choose a color workspace, follow these
steps:

1. Launch Photoshop Elements, and in the Adobe Photoshop Elements
Start Up Window that appears, click Edit and Enhance Photos to enter
Standard Edit mode.
For all our color correction work, we use the Standard Edit mode.
2. Select Edit➪Color Settings to open the Color Settings dialog box.
In the Color Settings dialog box, you have four choices, as shown in
Figure 4-3. Your choices include the following:
Figure 4-3: You can choose how to manage your images’ colors in the Color Settings window.
• No Color Management: Be certain to not select this option.
Clicking the radio button turns off all color management.
• Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens: This option uses
the sRGB color profile that Microsoft created as a general color pro-
file to display consistent color across computer monitors. Typically,
you use this profile for Web and screen graphics. However, our
tests show that the sRGB profile works best for most desktop color
printers. See Chapter 13 for more on color profiles and printing.
59
Chapter 4: Color Profiles and File Formats

60
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
• Always Optimize for Printing: This option suggests that you
should choose it for all printing. This profile contains more colors
than the sRGB color profile and works well with a number of printers.
However, if you’re working in Photoshop Elements and printing to
a typical desktop printer, the sRGB profile is better suited for print-
ing. Most desktop color printers can’t reproduce all the colors in
this workspace.
• Allow Me to Choose: Clicking this option means that a dialog box
opens when you open photos that have a different profile than
your chosen sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) color workspace. In the
dialog box, you can choose to convert color to your workspace or
preserve the workspace that was saved with the file. For example,
if your workspace is sRGB and you open a photo that was saved
with the Adobe RGB (1998) color workspace, you can choose to
convert Adobe RGB (1998) to sRGB or to leave the photo in the
Adobe RGB (1998) workspace. We suggest that you don’t select
this radio button until you fully understand what color conversion
is all about, as we explain in the section “Converting color,” later in
this chapter.
3. If you want to follow many of the lists of steps in this book, we recom-
mend selecting the Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens
radio button.
4. Click OK to exit the dialog box.
Embedding the workspace profile
After identifying the color workspace (which we cover in the preceding sec-
tion), follow these steps to embed the workspace profile in your photo:
1. Open an image in Photoshop Elements in Standard Edit mode.
2. Select File➪Save As to open the Save As dialog box, shown in
Figure 4-4.
3. From the Format menu, select a file format that supports embedding a
color profile.
Most of the time, you’ll choose .psd, .tiff, or .jpg. See the section
“Choosing and Changing File Formats,” later in this chapter, for more
details on using color profiles with different types of files.
4. Select the Color ICC Profile check box.
If the format you select supports profile embedding, the Color check box
becomes active. Select the box, and the profile you use for your work-
space appears to the right of ICC Profile, as shown in Figure 4-4.

5. Click Save.
The file is saved with the profile embedded in the image. If you exchange
the photo with a user who works with a different color workspace pro-
file, the user can choose to preserve the profile in the photo or convert
the color from your profile to his or her color workspace.
Figure 4-4: You can choose in what format you want to save your image 
in the Save As dialog box.
Managing Print Colors with Output Profiles
When it comes time to print your photos, part of your color-management
workflow involves using the right output profiles (also called device profiles).
In the following sections, we help you weigh your options as you decide
whether to opt for developer profiles or take a more customized (and more
expensive) approach to profiles.
61
Chapter 4: Color Profiles and File Formats

62
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
With your profile on your computer, you then need to install it and make sure
your printer gets the right profile information when you select your print
options. You can find an overview of how to use profiles in this chapter, and
Part IV explains in detail how you can incorporate profiles in the printing and
image-proofing process.
Acquiring device profiles
If you send your photos to a commercial photo lab or print vendor, you can
often find color profiles available on the vendor’s Web site specifically cre-
ated for the output equipment and papers that vendor uses. For your own
personal desktop printers, you can sometimes find output profiles available
on developer Web sites or on the CD that shipped with your printer. Paper
manufacturers may also provide profiles for printing to the different types of
paper they offer.
You may be wondering if the profiles you acquire from developer sites (also
known as canned profiles) are well suited to your printer and the paper you
use. Unfortunately, most canned profiles fall short of printing accurate color.
You may find that your printer does a very good job of printing to papers
supplied by your printer manufacturer. For example, the Epson line of print-
ers does an excellent job when printing to Epson papers, such as Premium
Photo Glossy and a number of other stocks. Epson has done a fine job in cre-
ating accurate profiles that get the color very close to what you see on your
monitor in a well-managed, color-management workflow.
But what happens when you want to print on a type of paper developed by a
manufacturer other than your printer manufacturer? For example, suppose
you use a Canon printer, and you want to print on Epson paper. Typically, the
paper manufacturer creates color profiles for the papers they produce, and
often, you can find profiles created for a particular paper when it’s used with
a number of different printers.
To understand how things can go awry, take a look at Figure 4-5. Both images
in this figure represent the results of printing on a Kodak Semi Matte paper
by using an Epson 4000 inkjet printer. Kodak’s own profile was used to create
the print on the right. The differences in the color transitions are very obvi-
ous, and you can see the many awkward color shifts. On the left, you see the
results of our custom-developed profile that we created with a hardware
color-profile device. In this image, the colors transition smoothly, creating a
pleasing flow of color.

Figure 4-5: A print with a custom color profile (on the left) looks much smoother than a print that used a
canned profile (on the right).
The only solution you have for such disparities in printing is to either buy a
hardware device capable of creating printer profiles or use a profiling serv-
ice. If you’re a professional or semi-professional photographer, you should
probably purchase equipment that enables you to develop custom profiles
for all your printers and papers.
If you like to use a particular printer and type of paper, and you use them reg-
ularly, then by all means, use an online profiling service and have a custom
profile created for you. For between $25 and $50, you end up saving in the
long run when you measure your costs against consumables you use to make
test prints to get the color right. We talk more about profiling services in the
following section.
If you find that the printer and paper you use with a canned profile provides
a good representation of your onscreen color images, stay with that canned
profile and the papers that work with your printer.
Getting profiles from a custom profile service
If you have a desktop color printer or large-format printer and you want to
have a profile created, you can use a custom service that creates the profile
for you. Rather than spend a lot of money on a calibration device you may
use for only a few printers, you can commission a provider that offers custom
profiling services for a fee.
63
Chapter 4: Color Profiles and File Formats

64
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Providers, such as inkjetart.com (www.inkjetart.com/custom_profiles)
and Dry Creek Photo (www.drycreekphoto.com), charge from $25 to $50 to
create a custom ICC profile for you, for each paper stock you use. At Dry
Creek Photo, you can get a year’s worth of support and free upgrades for $99.
Just log on to a provider Web site and download a target file. Then print the
target file, using no color management, on the paper type for which you want
to create the profile. Send the printed piece back to the provider, and they’ll
e-mail you a file attachment that you can copy to the folder where you save
your profiles.
For information on printing files without color management, see Chapter 13.
Getting profiles from a custom profile device
In a best-case scenario, you’d use a high-end device costing between $1,500
and $3,000 to create printer profiles for all your output devices. These custom
profile devices enable you to create custom profiles from test prints you
output to your printer.
A test page containing an array of colors is measured by the device’s spectrom-
eter, which you drag across rows and columns of printed color swatches.
After completing the color assessment, the device creates a profile for that
specific printer and paper.
Understanding CMYK color
CMYK color is commonly referred to as process
color and represents the four colors of Cyan,
Magenta, Yellow, and blacK. Print shops use
CMYK color for offset printing.
Some desktop color printers use four separate
inks — one for each of the CMYK colors. You may
also find five, six, seven, or more inks that include
variations of CMYK inks, such as Magenta, Light
Magenta, Cyan, Light Cyan, and so on.
When you print a file to a color printer that uses
CMYK inks, you print your RGB file to the printer.
You don’t need to make a color conversion from
an RGB to a CMYK color mode. It’s just as well that
you don’t have to convert color modes from RGB
to CMYK because Photoshop Elements doesn’t
support the CMYK color mode. (Other imaging
software programs, such as Adobe Photoshop,
do support the CMYK color mode, though.)
To prepare files for offset printing, you need to
submit your RGB files to your printer and have
the print shop convert your photos from RGB to
CMYK color. If you want to find out more about
CMYK color and programs supporting that color
mode, see Chapter 16.

GretagMacbeth (www.gretagmacbeth.com) offers the Eye-One Photo system,
a low-cost solution for a profile-creation system that includes calibration
equipment and software to calibrate your monitors, RGB and CMYK output
devices, digital cameras, scanners, and digital projectors for screen displays.
You can get this system for a list price of $1,695, as of this writing. If you want
to knock out digital cameras from the equipment support, you can purchase
the Eye-One Proof system for a suggested list price of $1,495.
If you decide to purchase a calibration system for your output device, be
careful to purchase the right system for the kind of output you produce.
Some devices are designed to create profiles for CMYK-only printers.
That’s fine for some inkjets and prepress proofing systems; however, devices
such as mini-photo labs and most of the desktop color inkjets are RGB output
devices and won’t benefit from a CMYK profiling system. See the nearby side-
bar “Understanding CMYK color” for more on RGB versus CMYK color.
Installing profiles on your computer
If you see a list of profiles in the Elements Print dialog box for your printer
and various types of papers after you install a printer driver on your com-
puter, your printer installation added the profiles automatically to the proper
folder on your hard drive.
On the other hand, you may acquire a printer profile from a desktop printer
developer, or you may have a custom profile created for your printer and a
certain type of paper. If this is the case, you may need to manually install a
profile to the location on your hard drive where all your output profiles are
stored. The Photoshop Elements Print dialog box lists all output profiles
stored in a specific folder on your hard drive.
The folder names and directory paths differ between Macintosh and
Windows. Look over the following sections to see where profiles are stored
on your system.
On a Mac
Follow these steps to install a profile on a Mac:
1. On the hard drive, select Library➪ColorSync➪Profiles.
The complete directory path is Macintosh HD/Library/ColorSync/
Profiles. If you don’t have Administrative privileges on your computer,
open your User folder and follow the path User/Library/ColorSync/
Profiles.
65
Chapter 4: Color Profiles and File Formats

66
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
2. Copy your profile to one of the Profile folders.
When you print files in Photoshop Elements, Elements looks to this
folder, which lets you easily select a printer profile. In Figure 4-6, you can
see all the profiles we have stored in our Profiles folder.
Figure 4-6: You can find color profiles stored in the Profiles folder on a Mac.
In Windows
To install a profile in Windows XP, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the Color folder on your hard drive, using the following
path: C:\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\color.
2. Copy your profiles to the color folder (shown in Figure 4-7).
The output profiles are logically grouped together when you open a
menu to select a profile.

Figure 4-7: You can store color profiles in the color folder in Windows.
Using output profiles when printing
After you acquire or create an output color profile, you need to use that pro-
file when you print to your desktop printer, or you need to somehow get the
color profile embedded in the image before sending that image file to a com-
mercial photo lab. You have two options for printing with color profiles, if
you’re using your own printer:
 Select the profile at print time.
 Convert color and embed the output color profile in your image.
If you send your images to a commercial lab for printing, the lab may provide
you instructions for saving your files as sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998), and they
perform the profile conversion when they print to their commercial equip-
ment. Ask a service what they prefer before you submit files.
Selecting a profile at print time
You select output color profiles at print time. After you perform all your color
and tonal corrections, select File➪Print to print your image. Selecting this
command opens the Print Preview dialog box. In the Print Preview dialog
box, shown in Figure 4-8, you can choose a printer profile from the Printer
Profile menu.
67
Chapter 4: Color Profiles and File Formats

68
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Figure 4-8: Choose a profile from the Printer Profile menu.
The Printer Profile menu is visible only when you select the Show More
Options check box in the lower left-corner of the Print Preview dialog box.
Ideally, you want to use the profile for the type of paper you’re printing on.
If no profile appears for your paper type in the Printer Profile menu, choose
your printer type from the menu. You can select the paper type later in the
Printer Properties. Selecting a profile and clicking the Print button then con-
verts your color workspace profile to the printer profile. This conversion is
automatic — you don’t have to do anything.

For specific details about printing photos, see Chapter 13.
Converting color
When you print a photo, the color workspace you use (either sRGB or Adobe
RGB [1998]) is converted to the color your printer uses. During the printing
process, the color workspace profile is converted to the printer color profile.
Typically, printer color profiles are installed on your computer when you
install a new desktop color printer.
Printer profiles are developed for each paper you use to print your pictures.
If, for example, you use a glossy photo stock, you should have a matching
printer color profile for that glossy photo stock.
One great limitation you have in Photoshop Elements is the lack of an option
to convert color within Elements. You have no menu command for converting
color from your workspace to your printer color. This limitation prevents you
from previewing onscreen the color as it will appear on the paper you use to
print your image. The color conversion happens at print time, and you get
your only proof of whether the color is correct from the final output, the
printed image.
We do have a workaround for converting color so that you can preview your
prints onscreen, and you can find much more detail on how to perform color
conversions in Chapter 14.
Choosing and Changing File Formats
To color manage your files, you need to know which file formats support
color management. In the following sections, you can find out which file for-
mats in Elements to use and which ones to avoid. You can also find out how
to convert a file from one format to another and still maintain its embedded
profile.
Which formats support profiles?
Not all file formats support embedding color profiles. Photoshop Elements
offers you a number of different file formats in which you can save your pic-
tures. Look over Table 4-1 and note the file formats that support profile
embedding.

With the number of file formats available, you may find deciding which
format to choose when working on photos and submitting them for printing
confusing. Fortunately, you can reduce the list of formats to just a few when
you find out what formats your own desktop color printer or the professional
photo lab to which you send your images supports.
The formats you’re most likely to use for color correction and printing
include
 Photoshop (.PSD; .PDD): Many people use this format when editing
photos. If you have to save a photo and return to it later to perform
more edits, save it as a .psd file, and the file is saved without compres-
sion. Before you submit the file to a photo lab, you can choose another
format in which to save the final file. When printing to your own desktop
color printer, you can print the file saved in this format — no need to
convert.
 JPEG (.JPG; .JPEG; .JPE): Your digital camera saves your photos
in JPEG format. Some cameras also support the camera raw format.
JPEG is a lossy compression format, which means you experience
some data loss each time you save the file as a JPEG. While working 
on a file, open a JPEG image and choose another format, such as
Photoshop .psd or TIFF, to prevent further data loss. If you submit
photos to a photo lab, the lab may request a JPEG file. Use the JPEG
format as the final step in your editing process just before you send files
to the lab.
 TIFF (.TIF; .TIFF): TIFF format is like the Photoshop .psd format, in
which the file is saved without lossy compression. Use this format when
saving files for output and when you need to integrate files in designs
that use other software programs.
When can you change a file format?
Because Photoshop Elements offers you only two choices for profile embed-
ding, you may be concerned about changing a file format from something
like TIFF to JPEG or vice versa. For example, say you save a file as a TIFF so
that you can use a profile converter to soft proof colors. Then, after doing
a final check of the file, you need to prepare the file for an output service,
which requires you to save your file as a JPEG. Services such as the Costco
Photo Labs require files in JPEG format. Fortunately, after you embed a 
profile in a photo, Photoshop Elements does permit you to preserve an
embedded profile.

Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
If you need to save the file in another format after you’ve embedded a profile
in your image, follow these steps:
1. Open the image in Photoshop Elements Standard Edit mode.
2. Select File➪Save As.
3. In the Save As dialog box, select the output format you want.
In this example, we open a TIFF file and choose JPEG as our Format, as
shown in Figure 4-9. The ICC Profile section of the Save As dialog box
shows you the color profile embedded (saved) in the file. If you leave
the ICC Profile alone, that profile is preserved when you save the file in a
different format.
Figure 4-9: Choose the file format you want to apply to your file from 
the Format menu.
4. Click the Save button.
5. In the dialog box that appears,
select the appropriate options.
If you select JPEG as your
format in Step 3, the JPEG
Options dialog box opens. Be
certain to move the slider to
Large File (12 and Maximum
appear above the slider), as
shown in Figure 4-10. This set-
ting minimizes data loss when
saving a file as a JPEG.
6. Click OK, and your file is
saved in the new format while
preserving the embedded 
profile.
Figure 4-10: Select the Maximum Quality when 
saving your image as a JPEG.

Only some file formats can embed color profiles. For the complete list of file
formats that support color profiles, see the preceding section.
Understanding Bit Depth
As we explain in Chapter 1, RGB color images are represented in three chan-
nels. Each of these channels contains a level of gray to express any given
color. Essentially, the gray values block out or hold back light. A level of 0 in
each channel means no light passes through any channel, resulting in a black
image. Conversely, a level of 255 is wide open and lets all light pass through,
resulting in a pure white image. The number 255 is a figure you want to
remember. Because 0 (zero) is also a number in the computer color world,
you have a total of 256 levels of gray in an 8-bit image.
When you work with 256 levels of gray for each channel, you’re working on
an 8-bit image. If you multiply 256 × 256 × 256, you get a number in excess
of 16 million, which is the total number of colors in the RGB color space.
When it comes time to reproduce your images on a printer, the printer out-
puts your file from 8-bit images in an effort to reproduce as many of those
possible 16.7 million colors as it can.
If you use a digital camera capable of
capturing camera raw images, your
camera sensors are likely to capture
12-bit or higher images — the most
common higher bit is 16 bit. A 16-bit
image has 4096 levels of gray per
channel. This extra data allows you
to decide which 256 levels of gray
you ultimately want to use on your
final printed piece. In Figure 4-11, for
example, you can see the Levels
dialog box (Image➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels) for an 8-bit image. The left
side of the histogram shows no data,
which means the darker areas of the
image have no detail.
Because your printer can print only 8-bit images, the extra image data from a
higher bit-mode file are tossed during printing. However, when you edit an
image for brightness and color correction, you want to perform as much of
your editing as you can while in a higher bit mode. Having the extra data in
an image lets you decide, when you print the image, which 256 levels of gray
you want to use from the 4096 levels you have.

distribution in an 8-bit image.

74
Part I: The Basics of Color Editing 
Figure 4-12 shows the Levels dialog
box for a 16-bit image with data
across all 256 levels of gray. You can
skew the input sliders on this image
to the left or right to pick up a little
more detail in either the highlights or
shadows. In essence, you’re telling
Photoshop Elements which levels of
gray you want to reproduce.
Photoshop Elements provides you
a means to convert 16-bit images
to 8-bit images by using the
Image➪Mode➪8 Bits/Channel menu
command. If the menu command
appears grayed out, as shown in Figure 4-13, you’re already working with an
8-bit image. If the menu command isn’t grayed out, you can select it to per-
form operations such as saving the file in JPEG format.
Figure 4-13: If the 8 Bits/Channel command is grayed out, the file is 
already in 8-bit mode.
Understanding dynamic range
Dynamic range is the measure of capturing data in the highlights and shadows.
If your images are clipped (showing no data on either end of a histogram), the
Figure 4-12: The Levels dialog box shows data
distribution in a 16-bit image.

dynamic range is much less than a photo in which you see a histogram con-
taining data at both ends and all through the midtone areas. In Figure 4-11,
you can see an absence of data on the left side of the histogram, indicating a
loss of detail in the highlights.
Input devices, such as cameras and scanners, are categorized in terms of
dynamic range, just as output devices are. Looking at a digital camera, you
can find many point-and-shoot models that boast more than 7 or 8 megapix-
els and cost less than $500. You can also find digital cameras in the 4- to 6-
megapixel range that cost more than $2,000. One of the primary differences
between the cameras is the dynamic range of the sensors. Obviously, the
more costly cameras provide you a greater dynamic range, which means you
see much more detail in the shadows and highlights.
16-bit images generally provide you more dynamic range, so you clearly
notice more detail in shadows and highlights.
Where you get 16-bit images
In Photoshop Elements, you’re stuck with 8-bit images if your camera can
capture only JPEG files. Unfortunately, you don’t have an option for convert-
ing 8-bit to 16-bit, which would be ideal for adjusting brightness, tones, and
color. If you have a camera that captures images in the camera raw format,
your images are captured in 16-bit mode. Perform all your brightness and
color corrections on higher bit images before you change the mode to 8-bit
for final printing.
For more information on camera raw, see Chapter 12. To find out more about
adjusting brightness on 8-bit and 16-bit images, see Chapter 11.

In this part . . .
A
s we continually repeat throughout this book,
you need to bring your photos into proper
tonal balance for brightness and contrast before
you do any color-correction work. This part is
divided into three chapters to help simplify tone
corrections.
We use different kinds of images to show how one
method may work better than others when you’re
adjusting brightness and contrast. We cover the
essential tools you need to use in Elements, and
we avoid talking about tools that won’t produce
the best results.
Chapter 5 covers how to make tonal and brightness
corrections to your image ﬁles, and Chapter 6
talks about how to ﬁx contrast. Finally, you can
discover the joys of adjustment layers in Chapter 7.

 Knowing when to bend (or break) the rules
T
he single most frequently used feature of a program like Photoshop
Elements is the ability to make brightness and color adjustments. If you
shoot pictures with a digital camera and want to print your photos, you prob-
ably want to darken up some of the light images and brighten up some
of the dark ones. If skin tones don’t look right, you need to make
some adjustment to color. Shooting a picture and being able
to print a perfect copy without needing to make any
brightness or color corrections is a rarity.
One thing that you need to remember when correct-
ing pictures for color is that you should always
begin by correcting brightness and contrast first.
Sometimes, a simple tweak of brightness and con-
trast can also balance the color in your pictures.
On the other hand, if you begin by adjusting color
and then work on brightness and contrast, the color
can get thrown out of whack.
In this chapter, we talk about using the tools Elements pro-
vides you for making brightness and tonal corrections. We add
in a few workarounds for getting around the limitations of the pro-
gram, and we also tell you when to break the rules. We discuss adjusting for

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
contrast in Chapter 6 and cover using adjustment layers for contrast edits in
Chapter 7. To get the most out of this Part, start here, in Chapter 5, and then
read through the following two chapters, as well.
Checking Out Your Images
Almost every photo you’ll ever shoot will need some tonal and brightness
corrections. Even the best digital camera metering systems are really just
making a best guess for the brightness and contrast needed for an acceptable
final result.
The exposure metering system doesn’t know what you have in mind when
you capture an image, and the internal image processing of your camera then
tries its best to generate a file based on a few assumptions. In general, these
assumptions are
 The image will have a slight amount of full black and pure white tones.
 All the tones mixed together will equal a medium gray.
These assumptions that your camera metering and processing systems make
are the cause of most exposure errors. Fortunately, Photoshop Elements has
some powerful tools to correct most of the problems.
The computer in your digital camera makes another assumption when 
creating the JPEG file that’s stored on your camera memory card. The
camera computer looks at the brightness range captured and selects a cer-
tain brightness range based on the entire capture to create a normal contrast
range.
This brightness range is about 61⁄2 f-stops from full white to full black. The
range happens to be the same as a good quality glossy photo paper. A photo
with a natural brightness range will look real to the viewer, so a 61⁄2 f-stop
brightness range is the default for the camera processor. Professional photog-
raphers spend years figuring out how to always make this magic range fit the
photo paper for a natural-looking result.
Sometimes, the captured range fits nicely, and the JPEG file has a full range of
tones. An example of a photo with a full range of tones appears in Figure 5-1.
In this photo, a pure white, a rich black, and a smooth transition of tones in
the midtone area appear.

Figure 5-1: A photo with a full range of tones.
Fixing Tone Problems
To illustrate how to correct tone problems, we picked out some images that
have a fair color balance and don’t need color correction. For more on under-
standing how to correct color, turn to Part III. In this section, we work on 
correcting the brightness and contrast in images. Most files have some
degree of color problems, too, but just worry about tone corrections for now.
If the captured range of brightness is too wide, the camera computer clips off
some of the tones, resulting in either blank white highlights or full black
shadows (and sometimes both). So what does it really mean to have a too-
wide range of brightness? Camera chips capture a range of light. If the light is
too bright, the light areas (called highlights) are clipped. Clipping means that
some of the tones are cut off or lost.
81
Chapter 5: Making Tonal and Brightness Corrections

82
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
On the other side of the tone curve, the camera chip might not capture
enough light, which results in clipping the dark areas, called the shadows.
When you look at a photo that has clipping in the highlights and shadows,
the picture appears washed out or too dark. You can’t completely fix these
kinds of problems after you actually take the picture, but you can edit the file
for best results with the data you have to work with.
Several kinds of image problems can occur when your camera sensor doesn’t
capture a full range of tones: too much or too little contrast, too much or too
little exposure, or a combination of contrast and exposure problems. As an
example, look at Figure 5-2. This photo has too much contrast.
Figure 5-2: A photo with too much contrast.
An image capture of a low-contrast scene looks muddy and lifeless with an
assumed 61⁄2 f-stop brightness range, in most cases; but at least all the data
are there in the file, and Elements allows you to easily fix the problem after
the fact. In Figure 5-3, you can see a good example of a flat file — one with
little contrast — that you can effectively correct in Photoshop Elements.
An image that’s underexposed looks too dark all over, and overexposed
images look too bright and washed out. The image shown in Figure 5-4, where
you see an overexposed picture, and the image in Figure 5-5, where you see
an underexposed picture, are more difficult to correct than the images with
contrast problems, shown in Figure 5-2 and Figure 5-3.

Using the Levels Dialog Box
Levels is perhaps a tool with a strange name — no, it doesn’t have anything
to do with checking the tilt of a picture frame. Levels got its name from the
256 levels of image tone we talk about in Chapter 1. Yes, it does display all
those image tones, but it does far more than that. It’s the best single tool
in Photoshop Elements (especially considering the crummy Color Curves
option that’s been added to Elements 5).
Levels allows you to set the black and white points, change overall image
brightness, and correct color casts. In this section, we take a look at the Levels
dialog box to help you completely understand the tool you have to work with.
It might seem a little bewildering at first, but you can master it in no time.
Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting and, from the submenu that appears, select
Levels to open the Levels dialog box, shown in Figure 5-6. Alternatively, press
Ctrl+L (Ô+L for Macs).

The most prominent feature of the Levels dialog box is the histogram. 
A histogram is just a bar chart, a sort of a graph that shows proportions.
The chart has 256 bars, and they all look blended together most of the
time. Black is far left, and white is far right. Gray is in the exact center.
The higher the bars on any given level, the more pixels of that tone are pres-
ent. For example, if the far-left black point has a high spike, your picture
has areas that show a pure black tone.
As shown in Figure 5-6, the graph appears like a bell curve. We drew a gradi-
ent across the bottom to show you how the tone, when blended with the
same tone level for all points, should appear.
The most important keyboard shortcut when you’re editing images for tone
and color corrections is Ctrl+L (Ô+L on a Mac) to open the Levels dialog box.
As you work through this chapter, and most of the chapters ahead, we contin-
ually return to the Levels dialog box.

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
To help you visualize what an image
might look like when you view a his-
togram, check out the toned view
shown in Figure 5-7. As you look at
the histogram, you can see this
altered view that shows the gradual
move from black on the left to white
on the right.
The default Levels dialog box in
Photoshop Elements shows the
graph as pure black simply to make
the whole thing easier to see.
You may have noticed that you also
have available in Elements a
Histogram palette that you can
access by selecting Window➪Histogram. The histogram graph is identical to
the Levels histogram. We prefer to use Levels to view a histogram while tone
editing because you can easily access the Levels dialog box with a keyboard
shortcut — something you can’t do with the Histogram palette. In addition,
you can always make an edit in the Levels dialog box, whereas the Histogram
palette offers no editing options.
To understand how a histogram represents a photograph, check out these
examples. Some of these examples are intentional exaggerations for the pur-
pose of clarity. Most of your own images will probably be easier to deal with
than these examples. We simply want to show you that the histogram is easy
to understand, even if you’re not a math wiz. Most of your images will have
one of five basic histogram shapes:
 A skew to the left: Underexposed images don’t have a true white point.
 A skew to the right: These histograms have no rich blacks and are gen-
erally the result of an overexposed image.
 No data on both ends: These histograms are quite often the result of a
low-contrast image with no true blacks or whites.
 A bell curve: When the tone points reach the ends of the graph, you’re
likely to find a properly exposed image.
 An inversed bell curve: These kinds of histograms come from high-
contrast images resulting from direct sunlight. These kinds of images
are the most difficult to make tone corrections to.
Figure 5-7: A tone histogram artificially
created to show the effect of the frequencies
of the tone points.

After you understand these shapes
and know what they mean in terms
of your image data, you begin to
have an idea about what corrections
you need to make.
The histogram shown in Figure 5-8
appears when you open the Levels
dialog box (Ctrl+L for PCs, Ô+L
for Macs) on the photo shown in
Figure 5-1.
The image has slightly more light
values (levels) than gray or dark
values, so the histogram hill is piled
up a bit on the right. The image has a
full tonal range from white to black,
so the histogram runs the entire
length of the box.
The histogram for the underexposed
photo in Figure 5-5 (shown in
Figure 5-9) never reaches the right
side because the photo has no white
values. The huge hill on the left rep-
resents all the dark values in the
image. The quantity of dark values
far exceeds the light values, as
shown by the low height of the rest
of the histogram.
As you might expect, the histogram
for the overexposed photo in Figure
5-4 is just the opposite of the under-
exposed photo. In Figure 5-10, all the
image data are piled toward the right
side, where light values reside. The
image lacks any full black tones, so
the histogram displays an absence of
image data long before it gets to the
left side. Almost the entire histogram
is to the right of middle gray.

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
The flat image shown in Figure 5-3
lacks both black and white. As you
might suspect, the tone data for this
flat image appear in the center of the
histogram, as shown in Figure 5-11.
The result is an image with very low
contrast. The histogram reflects the
lack of black or white tones because
the histogram doesn’t reach the
black and white endpoints in the
dialog box.
As a final view of histograms from dif-
ferent kinds of images, Figure 5-12
shows the histogram for the high-
contrast image shown in Figure 5-2.
This image is off the scale with
excessive contrast. Shooting into the
sun was far beyond the brightness
range of the camera. Much of the sky
is blown out to pure white values,
and the tree trunks are full black
with no detail. The histogram is piled
high on both the left and right side,
confirming the loss of shadow and
highlight detail. The center of the
histogram dips low, showing the lack
of normal middle tones.
All image editing should begin with
the Levels dialog box. Optimizing
your image file with Levels allows
the rest of the correction tools to work properly and saves you time and frus-
tration in the long run. There are times when Levels isn’t the best choice to
use first, but we do our best later in the book in Part III to show you the spe-
cial problem files where this is the case. Otherwise, always examine and edit
your file first with Levels.
Getting to Black and White
Setting a black-and-white point for your image is the single most frequently
used feature of the Levels dialog box. Most images require a small amount of
full black and white pixels to achieve a full tonal range and a pleasing sense
of brilliance in the final edited file. Some files need more black and white
adjustments.
Figure 5-12: The Levels histogram for a high-
contrast image.
Figure 5-11: The Levels histogram for an image
with little contrast.

If you work with JPEG files taken with your digital camera, the internal camera
processing has probably already made a guess at the proper black-and-white
point, and the histogram somewhat resembles the normal version shown in
Figure 5-13. Exposure errors or unusual lighting situations yield histograms
similar to the problem files we show you in the section “Using the Levels
Dialog Box,” earlier in this chapter.
You still always want to check the histogram and make any needed adjustments.
Adjusting Gamma levels
The Levels dialog box has three adjustment sliders (black point, white point,
and Gamma) that you use to adjust the brightness values. You can see these
sliders in Figure 5-13. Think of the Gamma adjustment in Levels (the center
slider) as the Brightness control. It’s just as important as the black-and-white
point settings when you’re editing your files. Moving the Gamma adjustment
controls how the light and dark tonal values are biased. Moving the Gamma
adjustment slider to the left lightens the image, and moves to the right
darken the image.
Figure 5-13: You use the three sliders to adjust brightness values.
Black point adjust
Gamma adjust
White point adjust
89
Chapter 5: Making Tonal and Brightness Corrections

90
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
The Gamma adjustment works by changing the proportions of the light and
dark tones. Here’s an example, using an image with a grayscale, to show what
the Gamma slider really does. To see the effects of the Gamma slider, check
out Figure 5-14, which is an unedited image before we make any Gamma
adjustments.
Figure 5-14: An unedited image.
Moving the Gamma slider re-proportions the image tones, resulting in a
lighter or darker image. Think of it as moving the middle gray value right or
left on the histogram — Elements then compresses or stretches the rest of
the tones to fit from white to black.

Moving the slider to the right shifts middle gray toward black. The dark tones
are stretched to fit, and the image darkens overall as a result, as you can see
in the left image in Figure 5-15. The shadow tones gain contrast, and the light
tones lose contrast. The light tones are smashed together, and the shadow
tones are spread out.
Figure 5-15: Moving the Gamma slider right darkens an image (left). Moving the slider left lightens an image
(right).
In Figure 5-15, you can see the results of moving the Gamma slider left to 1.75
on the right side of the image. Moving the slider to the left shifts middle gray
toward black. The light tones are stretched to fit, causing the image to lighten
up overall. The result has more contrast in the light portions of the file and
less in the dark tones.
This re-proportioning of the image tones is why you sometimes need to read-
just the white and black points after a big Gamma slider adjustment.

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Correcting a low-contrast file
Take a look at the low-contrast file shown in Figure 5-3. The overall bright-
ness is about right, but the image needs to be edited to add a touch of real
white and black tones.
To make corrections to this file, download tooFlat.jpg from the Chapter 5
folder of the Wiley companion Web site.
With the Levels dialog box open (Ctrl+L for PCs, Ô+L for Macs), move the black
and white sliders until they just touch the beginning of the histogram hill on
each side. This slider positioning controls where full black and white tones
should begin. Elements then remaps the available tones to stretch across all
256 Levels. You end up with a much snappier-looking image, as shown in
Figure 5-16.
Figure 5-16: A too-flat image after black and white tone correction.

If you reopen the Levels dialog box
again after the edit, you can see that
the remapped tones now create a
normal-looking histogram, with a
full 256 image tone levels (see
Figure 5-17). The large hill to the
right represents all the bright tones
in the sky area.
That was an easy fix. After setting the
black and white points, the overall
image brightness seemed fairly
normal. Sometimes, that’s all you
need to do.
Correcting an underexposed file
To make corrections to the image file shown in Figure 5-5, download
flowers.jpg from the Chapter 5 folder of the Wiley companion 
Web site.
In Figure 5-5, the tones are just too
dark overall, and the image has no
bright highlights to give it some
sparkle. In the Levels dialog box,
start by making a big Gamma slider
move to the left to lighten up the
overall image tones. Next, move the
white-point slider to the left until you
just touch the histogram, as shown
in Figure 5-18. Leave the black slider
in place because the histogram
shows that you already have full
black tones in the file.
The result after clicking OK in the
Levels dialog box shows a nicely
recovered underexposed photo, as
shown in Figure 5-19.

Correcting an overexposed file
An overexposed photo, such as the one in Figure 5-4, has the opposite prob-
lem of an underexposed image. Most of the tones are brighter than middle
gray, and the image looks washed out. To fix the problem, start with a large
Gamma slider move to the right to darken the light tone values. Move the
black slider to the start of the histogram hill on the left to insure that it main-
tains a full tonal range in the resulting file. Leave the white point slider at the
default position because the histogram indicates plenty of full white tones.
To make corrections to this file yourself, download duck.jpg from the
Chapter 5 folder on the Wiley companion Web site.

You should have an idea for the view of the histogram in the Levels dialog
box after moving the black-point slider to the beginning of the histogram hill.
The result in the image appears as shown in Figure 5-20. Compare this image
with the original in Figure 5-4.

Correcting a high contrast file
You can’t really repair a file with excessive contrast by using the Levels com-
mand, but Elements has provided some advanced tools that can improve a
contrasty file a great deal. To find out more about correcting images with
high contrast problems, see Chapter 6.
Finding the first real black and white pixels
For the editing examples in this chapter, we play a little fast and loose with
our black-and-white point settings. It’s perfectly all right to set black-and-
white point by bumping the sliders into each side of the visible histogram,
but to obtain the very best final quality from a file, you may need to know
exactly where the first white and black pixels are located and the exact slider
position you need to find them.
With most image files, only a tiny percentage of the image pixels should be
full white or black. Overdoing the edit can cause posterization (the replace-
ment of subtle gradations of color with patchy, abruptly-changing colors) and
lack highlight and shadow detail. This over-editing can make tonal edits with
other Elements tools more difficult or prevent the best final result.

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
You can see posterization in images when you spread out the pixels, leaving
gaps in the tone curve that are visually apparent in the histogram. The pixels
are then clumped together at the nearest tone points and produce a muddy
gray color in areas of your photo.
When in doubt, be conservative with the black-and-white point settings. You can
always go back and clip off a few more tones later, but you can never recover
tones lost after a bad edit.
As an example, take a look at a file that requires a precise setting of black and
white points. The file in Figure 5-21 has normal contrast but lacks full white
and black tones. As a result, the image just doesn’t pop off the page like it
should. We want to correct the file, but we need to do it very carefully.
To make corrections on the same file, download girl.jpg from the Chapter 5
folder of the Wiley companion Web site.
Figure 5-21: This image needs a subtle fix to its black and white tones.

The Levels black-and-white preview option
The Levels dialog box has a nifty option for viewing the pixels you select when
you use the black and white sliders. This Levels viewing option comes in very
handy on an image such as Figure 5-21. To use this option, follow these steps:
1. Open the file you want to edit and open the Levels dialog box (Ctrl+L
for PCs, Ô+L for Macs).
2. Set the black point.
Place the cursor on the black-point slider, hold down the mouse button,
and press Alt/Option on your keyboard. If your file has no black pixels,
the image window turns completely white. That’s normal. The window is
telling you that the black slider needs to move to the right to create
some black pixels.
Slowly move the black slider while holding down the Alt/Option key until
the first real black pixel tones show up in the image window. As our exam-
ple shows, some colored pixels appear in the window along with a few
black pixels. (See Figure 5-22.)
Figure 5-22: Press the Alt/Option key and move the black slider 
until you see black appear in the image.
97
Chapter 5: Making Tonal and Brightness Corrections

98
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
As a general rule, move the black slider until you can see just a few black
pixels. Release the Alt/Option key, and your image returns, showing the
result of the black slider move.
3. Set the white point.
Hold down the Alt/Option key again and use the cursor to move the
white-point slider to the left. The image window becomes full black if the
file has no white pixels. Move the white point slider left until the first vis-
ible pixels begin to light up on the dark background. (See Figure 5-23.)
Figure 5-23: Press the Alt/Option key and move the white slider until  
you see white appear in the image.
Use a little caution when setting a white point. A lot of red pixels appear
before the first real white pixel becomes visible. Those red pixels
show up first because the red-channel pixels are being clipped first.

The underlying image is of the little girl’s blond hair, and the color is
highly saturated. The red channel’s pixel values are the brightest in that
area and reach a tone value of 255 before any other pixels in the file.
Red and green make yellow, and the hue of blond hair needs a little more
red than green to look normal.
As a general rule, you probably want to set the white point based on the
first pixels that become visible onscreen, regardless of the color, to
avoid loss of highlight detail in bright-colored areas of the file. You espe-
cially want to follow this rule if the file also needs moderate to heavy
color correction.
In Figure 5-24, the file is shown after a custom setting of black and white
points, using the Levels preview method.

In Figure 5-25, the black and white points have been over-corrected. Notice
the harsh posterization of the bright highlights and loss of highlight detail.
The darkest shadows are blocked up and lacking detail. Be careful — after
you clip off the highlight and shadow tones with Levels, they’re gone forever.
Figure 5-25: Over-correction can lead to bright highlights and posterization.
Breaking the Rules of Editing
In this chapter, we tell you all the rules for tone editing your images with the
Levels dialog box. But hey, sometimes you have to break the rules! Knowing
when to break the rules depends on the image content and the final result
you’re after.

We refer to moving the sliders to the beginning of the histogram hill on
either side of the histogram as standard edits. These standard edits work
when you’re editing images that need brightness adjustments to the 
backgrounds and foregrounds equally, and the results render a pure white
and a rich black.
Sometimes, however, an overall adjustment doesn’t bring the most important
part of your photos into a suitable brightness and contrast view. You might
want to weight the adjustment to emphasize the foreground subject matter
or the background contrast and brightness, or you may need to adjust both
separately. For these kinds of edits, you need to break the rules of standard
editing for the Levels tool.
Knowing when to break the rules
To determine whether you should break the rules or follow more conven-
tional editing guidelines, follow these steps:
1. Examine your image.
The first step in any editing process is to study your photo after opening
it in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac in Elements 4).
Know what problems exist and what you need to correct. Determine
whether the photo has a good pure white and a rich black. In some
images, a very small portion of your photo or just a few pixels may be
pure white or rich black. Finding the white and black points in a photo
by moving the Levels slider remaps the histogram and recalculates the
tone curve so the tonal transitions ultimately appear much better.
2. Test a standard edit.
Open the Levels dialog box and move the sliders to the beginning of the
histogram hill on both sides of the histogram. Click the title bar on the
dialog box and drag the dialog box out of the way so you can see the
preview for the adjustment. (Make sure that the Preview check box in
the dialog box is selected.)
At this point, ask yourself whether the highlights contain a pure white
and the shadows have a rich black. If they do, you can click OK, and
you’re finished with editing for tonal brightness. If the answer is no, 
you need to break the rules. While in the Levels dialog box, press the
Alt/Option key, and the Cancel button changes to Reset. Click the Reset
button, and you can start your editing by using the methods we describe
in the following sections.
101
Chapter 5: Making Tonal and Brightness Corrections

102
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
3. Determine the most important part of the photo.
If you need to break the rules, look over the photo and determine what
content is the most important part. Is it the foreground or the background,
highlights or shadows? Camera chips quite often don’t capture a full range
of tones from white to black under many different lighting conditions.
You can improve many photos by making edits to the most important
areas of the image. After you determine what’s important, knowing
which direction to proceed with your edits becomes much easier.
Breaking the rules for white-point adjustments
A good example of a photo where breaking the rules works well is when you
have different lighting for foreground and background areas. In most cases, a
single adjustment in the Levels dialog box can’t completely correct the
brightness in the photo.
If you don’t have such an image, you can use the file cat.jpg in the Chapter 5
folder on the companion Web site.
Follow these steps on photos in which the background appears with bright
backlighting and the foreground appears darker in a shaded area:
1. Open a file with uneven lighting, such as a photo that has a dark fore-
ground and bright background.
Figure 5-26 is a snapshot of a family cat taken on a shaded porch. The
original file is too dark because the camera meter was fooled by the
bright spots in the sunny background.
Figure 5-26: A photo shot under shade with bright backlighting.

2. Open the Levels dialog box by
pressing Ctrl+L (Ô+L for Macs),
shown in Figure 5-27.
After opening Levels, you can
see that many pixels are already
a full white tone because the
histogram slams up against the
right side of the window. In this
image, all the full-white (or near-
white) pixels are in the bright
background. With a photo such
as this, the background doesn’t
matter; we want to see the kitty!
3. Keeping the black point at the
default position, move the
Gamma slider to the left (to
about 1.50) to brighten the image.
Click OK and review the results. A single Gamma adjustment leaves you
with a very dreary, low-contrast image of the kitty, as you can see in
Figure 5-28.
Because you want the viewer’s attention on the kitty, edit for the kitty
and ignore the background.
4. Select Edit➪Undo or press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z for Macs) to undo the 
last edit.

the foreground but leaves you with a flat, dreary image.

Chapter 5: Making Tonal and Brightness Corrections
Figure 5-27: The histogram shows more tone
levels in the black with a strong decline in the
light area of the photo.

104
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
5. Find the white point in the foreground.
Open Levels again (Ctrl+L for PCs, Ô+L for Macs). After you open Levels,
hold down the Alt/Option key, ignore the background, and move the
white-point slider until you see the first pixels of the kitty. The back-
ground is blooming in the preview, but you’re editing for the cat only,
so ignore the background. The cat isn’t pure white, so after you see the
first kitty pixels, back off the adjustment — move the slider back toward
the right a little. In this photo, we rest the white-point slider at 205, as
shown in Figure 5-29.
6. Move the black slider to the right slightly to insure a full black in the
cat part of the image.
Yes, it’s well into the black side of the histogram, but the cat part of the
image looks best with that setting. Our final black point adjustment rests
at 10.
Figure 5-29: Press Alt/Option and drag the white-point slider until you see some white pixels and then move
back slightly to the right.

7. Make a Gamma slider adjust-
ment left to lighten the image
and click OK.
The final edits in the Levels
dialog box appear, as shown in
Figure 5-30.
8. Click OK in the Levels dialog
box and look over the final
edited image, shown in
Figure 5-31.
The resulting file has better
tonal separation on the cat, and
the resulting highlight clipping
and loss of detail on the back-
ground doesn’t really detract
from the image.
Figure 5-31: Hello, kitty! The final edits show a proper brightness 
correction on the foreground subject.
Breaking the rules for black-point adjustments
Do you find that some of your snapshots don’t snap — they just don’t look
like they have the right contrast? Do blacks in the photo appear flat without a
rich black look? This flat appearance is common for many photos taken with

Chapter 5: Making Tonal and Brightness Corrections
Figure 5-30: Adjusting the midtones by moving
the Gamma slider lightens the foreground.

106
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
indoor flash and in low lighting conditions. For this kind of photo, a simple
Levels adjustment doesn’t put the punch in the image, so you may need to
break the rules to adjust the brightness. The solution is to intentionally over-
edit the black point.
If you like, use the file couple.jpg in the Chapter 5 folder on the companion
Web site.
To add a crisper look by over-editing the black point in photos that need a
rich black, follow these steps:
1. Open the photo in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac,
using Elements 4).
Figure 5-32 is a typical kind of snapshot for which you need to break the
rules. This snapshot was lit by the in-camera flashgun, and the back-
ground received far less overall illumination. The background isn’t really
important in a photo such as this, so you want to devote your attention
to the foreground subjects. Overall, the photo is a little underexposed.
Figure 5-32: An underexposed photo lacking contrast and a rich black.

2. Open the Levels dialog box
(Ctrl+L on PCs, Ô+L on Macs)
and move the white-point
slider to the beginning of the
histogram hill, as shown in
Figure 5-33.
3. Click OK in the Levels dialog
box and examine the edited
image.
As you can see in Figure 5-34, a
standard edit following the stan-
dard rules gives this photo a
visually dull result. The overall
adjustment sets the black point
to the background, whereas the
main foreground subject (the
most important part of this photo) lacks any true black tones.
With this kind of file, you need to use the foreground main subject as your
reference for the black-and-white point, rather than the entire image.

Chapter 5: Making Tonal and Brightness Corrections
Figure 5-33: A standard rule of thumb is to
move the white (and black) points to the
beginning of the histogram hill.

108
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
4. Press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z for Macs) to undo the edit and return to the original
unedited image.
5. Find the black point on the foreground subjects.
You need to know where black begins in the most important area of the
photo and ignore the least important part, which is the background area.
Open the Levels dialog box (Ctrl+L for PCs, Ô+L for Macs). Press the
Alt/Option key and drag the black-point slider to the right. In this exam-
ple, we move the black slider to level 28.
6. Adjust the white point.
Still in the Levels dialog box,
use the white-point slider to find
the first white pixels in the fore-
ground subject. The foreground
subject has the brightest image
tones, so you do the edit by
using the standard procedure.
Press the Alt/Option key and
move the white-point slider
until a few bright pixels become
visible. The results of both
slider adjustments are shown in
Figure 5-35.
As you can see, much of the background has reached full black as you
begin to see the first black pixels in the foreground subject. As shown in
Figure 5-35, the black-point slider has moved well into the left side of the
histogram. The portion to the left of the slider represents pixels in the
unneeded background tones. When you move the Levels dialog box out
of the way of the image behind it, you can see the effect on the photo, as
shown in Figure 5-36. Note that you need to select the Preview check box
in the Levels dialog box to view results in the image window while the
Levels dialog is open.
7. Adjust the Gamma.
The photo is obviously much too dark, but you have the correct black-and-
white point adjustments. Therefore, you only need to adjust the overall
brightness. For this adjustment, use the Gamma slider. Move the middle
slider to the left. (We moved it to about 1.56 for the image in Figure 5-37.)
8. Click OK in the Levels dialog box.
When you compare the original image to the final edited image, shown in
Figure 5-37, the edited image is a much better quality than the original. Breaking
the rules and pushing the black point limit well into the histogram didn’t harm
the image. In fact, the edit produced what we were after when we captured the
original image. Even though the black limit was set well into the histogram,
the edited image preserved the important shadow detail of the subject matter.

It’s okay to break the rules, as long as you get the results you need.

n Chapter 5, we talk about making Levels adjustments for tonal and bright-
ness corrections. The most important aspects of these corrections are 
setting a white point, a black point, and a Gamma adjustment for the mid-
tones. These edits only get you halfway, however, in terms of creating an
image with overall pleasing brightness. You next need to consider
editing image contrast.
Conceivably, you could have an image with a pure white
point, a rich black, and a good overall brightness
appearance that’s still much too contrasty or flat.
This chapter picks up where Chapter 5 leaves off:
After you make adjustments for brightness in the
Levels dialog box, you’re ready to take a look at some
solutions for getting a proper contrast balance.
Correcting Image Contrast
What do we mean by image contrast? After you set the white
and black points to obtain a full tonal range in the image, the result-
ing image contrast can actually vary all over the place. It all depends on the

112
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
original tones and lighting of the subject matter and your personal tastes for
the way you want the image to appear.
For a better understanding of what we mean by changing image contrast, check
out the photo shown in Figure 6-1. This still-life image has a full range of tones
from white to black and a full set of midtones — something we achieve just
by using the Levels dialog box. We include a 15-step grayscale in the figure to
help show what we mean by changing midtone contrast. The contrast is just
right in the photo shown in Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1: The proper image brightness and contrast make this 
photo look tasty!
Figure 6-2 shows the same photo after we edited it to reduce the image con-
trast. Notice the loss of contrast in the center area of the grayscale. You can
see less visible difference in tone from one step to the next.
We edited the file in Figure 6-3 to increase the image contrast. We greatly
increased the contrast of the midtones. You can see a much greater differ-
ence in tone from one midtone step to the next.

114
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
In both of the modified files, all the tones are still there. The contrast adjust-
ments just rearranged the tone distribution. Both files still have pure white
and black tones with no tonal losses. A look at the histograms in the Levels
dialog box confirms the fact that each of the images has a black point, a white
point, and tone separation, as you can see in Figure 6-4. On the left, you see
the histogram for the original file (Figure 6-1), in the middle is the file with a
lower image contrast (Figure 6-2), and on the right you see the histogram for
the high-contrast photo (Figure 6-3). If you start with a low- or high-contrast
image and need to change image contrast, you can’t use Levels exclusively to
make an image contrast correction.
Figure 6-4: See the difference in the histogram for a normal image (left), a low-contrast image (middle), and a
high-contrast image (right).
You can use one of two methods to adjust image contrast. Elements has a
quick-and-dirty method for adjusting contrast called the Brightness/Contrast
menu command. The other method involves making edits with the Levels
dialog box and the Adjust Color Curves command.
You need to make your black- and white-point adjustments first when you’re
editing for contrast. Use one of the methods we cover in the following section to
adjust the white point and the black point. After a quality Levels edit, changing
the image contrast really means modifying the tonal contrast of the midtones.
Fixing Contrast Problems with the 
Auto Contrast Command
The Auto Contrast command (Enhance➪Auto Contrast) sets the black- and
white-point limit for you. Unfortunately, Elements doesn’t offer any controls
that enable you to change the Auto Contrast attributes. The command simply
examines your file data and sets the black and white points based on the
assumption that one-tenth of one percent of your image pixels (one in a thou-
sand) should be pure white and the same proportion should be pure black.

It should really be called Auto Black and White Points because that’s what
actually happens when you use the command. It doesn’t have a clue about
the original overall image contrast of your file. It can, however, be a very
useful edit for some files.
The Auto Contrast command does nothing on a file that already has some full
white and black tones if the black and white pixels comprise more than one
in a thousand of the total image pixels. Elements doesn’t allow you to custom
set the black-and-white clipping percentages like its big brother, Photoshop
CS2, does. The default setting is a kind of best average, and you can’t change
it. The following example shows how it works.
To follow along in these steps, use the missouri.jpg file you can download
from the Chapter 6 folder on the Wiley companion Web site.
To edit an image with the Auto Contrast command, follow these steps:
1. Open an image that appears flat and doesn’t have true black or white
pixels.
For this example, we use the photo shown in Figure 6-5. You can down-
load this image from the Chapter 6 folder on the companion Web site if
you don’t have a photo with similar brightness and contrast problems.
Because this photo has no white or black pixels, using Auto Contrast will
set the black and white points by using the default settings.

2. Press Ctrl+L (Ô+L for Macs) or
select Layers➪New Adjustment
Layer➪Levels to open the
Levels dialog box and take a
look at the histogram, shown in
Figure 6-6.
After checking the histogram,
click Cancel to close the
dialog box.
3. Select Enhance➪Auto Contrast
to run the Auto Contrast 
command.
4. Reopen the Levels dialog
box and check the histogram
again.
After using the Auto Contrast
command, the histogram
appears as shown in Figure 6-7.
You can see the change in the
remapping of the tone curve in
this histogram, compared to
Figure 6-6, as a result of the
Auto Contrast adjustment. After
the Auto Contrast edit, you can
see confirmation that the black
and white points have indeed
been reset.
The Auto Contrast command got
pretty close to the best setting in
Figure 6-7. Black and white points
were reset. But should you routinely use Auto Contrast for image editing?
It depends. A custom setting of black and white points in Levels allows 
you to decide exactly where you want the black and white points to be for
best possible results. Also, you can change image brightness by adjusting the
Gamma slider in the Levels dialog box. Therefore, in many cases, the Auto
Contrast feature can’t give you the results you can get by using custom
adjustments.
On the other hand, if you have 200 photos of a kid’s birthday party to
edit, you may find Auto Contrast a real time-saver. Doing 200 custom 
adjustments may just be impractical. As a matter of practice, you may
want to manually correct images for brightness and contrast when time 
permits.
Figure 6-6: The Levels dialog box for the
battleship image shows you where the data fall
on the histogram.
Figure 6-7: The battleship’s histogram after
using Auto Contrast.

In the example in this section, a Levels adjustment took care of the bright-
ness and the contrast, and it did a pretty good job. You won’t always be that
lucky, though. After adjusting the brightness in Levels, you may need to use
other methods to either boost or lower contrast. Everything depends on your
image data and the results you want. In this chapter, we stick to making
adjustments on a single layer. You have more options for contrast control
when you use additional layers, as we explain in Chapter 7.
Working with the Brightness/Contrast Command
Under the Enhance➪Adjust Lighting menu, you can find a tool called
Brightness/Contrast. You might be wondering why we didn’t use that tool for
our contrast example in the preceding section. We have a very good reason:
The Brightness/Contrast command is a completely bogus tool that should have
been deleted from both Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop long ago.
Never use this tool! We, the authors, have been serious Elements/Photoshop
users for many years, and we never, ever use this tool. Just forget it exists alto-
gether, please! We have a much better way to perform high-quality edits for
brightness and contrast. In order to
use the tools for these edits properly,
we have to introduce the use of
adjustment layers, which we explain
in Chapter 7.
You may have heard from others
that you should never use the
Brightness/Contrast command, but
perhaps you don’t know why —
or maybe you haven’t seen any 
comparative images showing the 
differences between using the com-
mand and using other correction
methods. In this chapter, we show
you exactly why you want to avoid
the Elements Brightness/Contrast
command if you want quality results
when you change overall image 
contrast.

trast. Download the lights.jpg file

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
An image of this nature can work well with different amounts of contrast,
depending on personal taste. This section compares reducing contrast by
using the Elements Brightness/Contrast tool to doing the same adjustment
with a contrast reduction layer. You can find the steps for creating and using
contrast reduction layers in Chapter 7, but don’t worry too much about that
now. In this section, we’re just illustrating why the Brightness/Contrast tool
doesn’t measure up to other methods of contrast correction.
The results of the two methods appear in Figure 6-9. On the left side of the
figure, you can see just about the best contrast adjustment we could get by
using the Brightness/Contrast dialog box. The right side of the figure shows a
contrast adjustment we made by using a contrast reduction curve and an
adjustment layer (which we explain how to do in Chapter 7).
Figure 6-9: The flashlights got the Brightness/Contrast treatment (left) and a contrast
adjustment layer (right).

Notice how flat and awful the image
on the left in Figure 6-9 looks. The
tool really only resets the black and
white points toward gray. When you
open the Levels dialog box and look
at the histogram for the image on the
left side of Figure 6-9, you can easily
see what happened to the data. (See
Figure 6-10.) The file was wrecked
in a single edit! You end up with a
grayed-out, veiled file.
Now, compare Figure 6-10 to
Figure 6-11, which is the histogram
for the image corrected with a con-
trast reduction curve. Image contrast
is nicely reduced, but you still main-
tain a full tonal range. The histogram
shows you’ve maintained some true
full black and white tones.
Next, compare results from the
Brightness/Contrast tool when you
use it to increase contrast, compared
to the results from using a contrast
increase adjustment layer. Figure 6-12
shows the results of trying to produce
a moderate contrast gain by using the
Brightness/Contrast tool on the left
and a contrast increase curve on the
right.
Observe the bright highlights on
the left side of the flashlights in
Figure 6-12. The Brightness/Contrast adjustment tool completely clipped
the white highlight values, leaving behind blank posterized white areas.
(Posterized refers to areas that are supposed to be subtle gradations of color
but have instead morphed into patchy areas of abrupt color transition.)
The bright illuminated tops of the flashlights have areas clipped to paper
white. Much of the shadow detail has turned to posterized black values.

Figure 6-12: The flashlights get a contrast boost with the Brightness/Contrast tool (left) and a
contrast increase curve (right).
The contrast increase layer resulted in a smooth transition of highlight tonal
values without abrupt posterization to white. Notice also the way the layer
retained shadow detail in the dark areas of the flashlights. The resulting his-
tograms from the two files shows why you get such a difference in final quality.
In Figure 6-13, the histogram on the left is from the original unedited file
(Figure 6-8). The middle histogram is from the Brightness/Contrast adjusted
file (Figure 6-12, on the left). Using Brightness/Contrast simply sets the black
and white points closer to the center of the histogram, exactly as if you’d
pushed the black and white sliders too far into the histogram. You end up
with severely clipped black and white points. On the right, you can see the
histogram from the file edited by using a contrast increase curve (Figure 6-12,
on the right). A contrast increase curve changes the contrast of only the mid-
tones and leaves the black and white point settings unaltered. The histogram
shows no tone clipping.

You might look at Figure 6-13 and wonder why we say the middle histogram has
tone clipping. Take a careful look at the center histogram in Figure 6-13 — you
can find spikes at either end of the histogram. These spikes represent the data
shoved up against a wall: It can’t go any farther. If the data could go farther, it
would travel outward and eventually dwindle out. Because they can’t reach
beyond the edge of the histogram, the data are smashed together, and the
tones that could have extended beyond the histogram are cut off — or clipped.
Compare the center histogram with the one on the far right. You don’t find
spikes at the histogram edges. The data just stop before they reach the edge,
so the histogram on the right doesn’t show clipped tones.

(middle), and the file after using a contrast increase layer (right).
Modifying Contrast with Adjust Color Curves
Without getting into how to make complex edits for contrast by using adjust-
ment layers (we go into adjustment layers in Chapter 7), you have a couple
of other ways you can modify image contrast in Elements without using the
dreaded Brightness/Contrast command.
Elements 5 has introduced a new feature called Adjust Color Curves. This 
feature is a dumbed-down version of the Curves command found in Adobe
Photoshop. Photographers and professional image editors routinely use
Curves in Photoshop to adjust images for brightness, contrast, and color 
correction. (See Chapter 16 for more on Photoshop Curves.) In an effort to
provide Elements users with a tool to perform similar edits, Adobe intro-
duced the Adjust Color Curves tool in Elements 5.
121
Chapter 6: Correcting Contrast

122
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Photoshop Elements 4 for the Mac doesn’t have the Adjust Color Curves fea-
ture. Adjust Color Curves is a new feature in Elements 5 initially introduced
on Windows only. Until Elements 5 for the Mac appears, you won’t be able to
use this feature. If you’re a Mac user, don’t be disappointed. To be honest, we
don’t find this tool a great addition for correcting brightness, contrast, or
making color corrections. You can access all the other methods we talk about
in this book on the Mac by using Photoshop Elements 4.
The Adjust Color Curves command, in its present form, doesn’t really work
as well as it could because of some built-in limitations, but you can use an
option in the tool called Midtone Contrast to perform minor contrast adjust-
ments without wrecking your file.
You may not intuitively think that you should use the Adjust Color Curves
tool for correcting brightness and contrast because you access it from the
Adjust Color submenu. When you open the Adjust Color Curves dialog box,
however, you soon find out that you have options for adjusting brightness,
contrast, midtone contrast, and shadows. All of these options are targeted at
making brightness and contrast corrections, as well as color adjustments.
(For more information on correcting color, see Part III.)
To open the Adjust Color Curves dialog box, select Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Color Curves. The Adjust Color Curves dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 6-14.
Figure 6-14: The Adjust Color Curves dialog box offers some good tools 
for correcting brightness problems.

As you can see in Figure 6-14, the Adjust Color Curves dialog box provides you
some thumbnail previews for midtone, contrast, and shadow adjustments.
Using this pane in the Adjust Color Curves dialog box is similar to using the
Color Variations dialog box we talk about in Chapter 10: Click an image preview,
and that particular adjustment is applied to your image. You have but one shot
at making a correction here. In other words, if you click Increase Contrast
once, you can’t click again to add more contrast. These options are single
fixed edits, and you have no control over the attributes for the adjustment.
Below the image previews, you can see a right-pointing arrow to the left of
the words Advanced Options. Click the arrow, and the Adjust Color Curves
dialog box expands to provide additional choices, as shown in Figure 6-15.
Figure 6-15: Click the arrow to the left of Advanced Options, and the 
dialog box expands to provide more options.
You can best adjust highlights, shadows, and midtone brightness in the
Shadows/Highlights dialog box, which we talk about in the following section.
Forget about the Shadows/Highlights dialog box for now and take a look at
the Midtone Contrast slider in the Adjust Color Curves dialog box. If you
move the slider, the points on the graph that appears on the right side of the
123
Chapter 6: Correcting Contrast

124
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Advanced Options section move just to show you a visual of the tone curve.
You might be able to make some slight contrast corrections by moving the
slider, but be careful to not move it too far in either direction: You can create
some problems by over-editing in the Adjust Color Curves dialog box.
Our impression of Adjust Color Curves is that the points represented by the
five squares on the tone curve were placed too close together to be an effec-
tive tool. You can’t grab any of the tone points or plot additional points on
the curve. You’re stuck with moving those three points in the center of the
graph by using the sliders. (And if you adjust the Increase Contrast slider,
only the third middle-tone point moves.) You can’t move the white and black
points, shown at the lower-left and upper-right corners, at all.
Because these tone points are fixed at the default locations, and Elements
doesn’t give you any options for plotting additional points or exercising
more control than the sliders provide you, you run the risk of flattening the
midtones if you move the sliders too far. The tool isn’t completely useless —
you can make a few useful adjustments by using Adjust Color Curves.
Using the Shadows/Highlights 
Tool to Adjust Contrast
The Shadows/Highlights tool is a very useful feature for tone editing in Elements.
This tool has the best contrast adjustment available in Elements, outside of
using adjustment layers. (See Chapter 7 for details on using adjustment layers.)
Shadows/Highlights also supports 16-bit file editing. (For more on 16-bit file
editing, see Chapter 12.)
The Shadows/Highlights tools that adjust contrast do so without changing
the image color saturation. (The Adjust Color Curves tool can’t change con-
trast without affecting color saturation.) You can usually use the contrast
adjustment in Shadows/Highlights more easily because any preset image sat-
uration will be maintained. The contrast change isn’t as smooth across the
tonal range as the results you get when you use contrast adjustment layers
(see Chapter 7), but the Shadows/Highlights tool is still very useful.
To use the Shadows/Highlights tool for contrast control, select Enhance➪
Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/Highlights. The Shadows/Highlights dialog box
opens. First, you want to bring the Lighten Shadows slider all the way to the
left. This slider move turns off the default shadow lighting. Next, for contrast
control, work with the Midtone Contrast slider as shown in Figure 6-16.
Moving the slider left decreases contrast, whereas moving it right increases
contrast. Click OK when you’re finished making adjustments.

Figure 6-16: With the Shadows/Highlights dialog box, you can really 
control your contrast adjustments.
The Shadows/Highlights tool is a very useful editing feature in Elements. With
this tool, you can make tonal adjustments that you can’t with any of the other
tone-editing tools. This tool works much differently than either Levels or
Adjust Color Curves.
The Shadows/Highlights tool works by zeroing in on just the highlight or
shadow tones when editing. It automatically creates masks of just the light
or dark portions of your file. The tool is designed to lighten shadow tones or
darken bright highlight tones, or it can do both at once.
A mask is a kind of digital overlay window on the image. The tool then works
on just what it can see through the mask. This feature makes the tool differ-
ent than Levels or Adjust Color Curves. Any time you make a tone change in
Levels or Adjust Color Curves, such as lightening the file, you lose tone infor-
mation everywhere in the picture as a result. There’s no free lunch in digital
editing.
With some kinds of files, the Shadows/Highlights tool is the only solution to
fix problem tones. To understand when the Shadows/Highlights tool is the
best tool for the job, take a look at an image with poor contrast and edit the
file by using just Levels and a contrast adjustment curve.
To follow the steps precisely, you can download the file photographer.tif
from the Chapter 6 folder on the Wiley companion Web site.

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
In Figure 6-17, we have a photo that needs a contrast boost. Follow these
steps to make an adjustment by using Levels and a contrast adjustment layer:
1. Open an image that needs a contrast adjustment in Elements in Full
Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on the Mac).
The photo in Figure 6-17 is a snapshot of a photographer working on a
foggy day. The flat lighting resulted in a dreary-looking image. The foggy
sky is the light source, and it’s much lighter than the rest of the image.
Figure 6-17: This photographer needs a boost in contrast.
2. Open the Levels dialog box by pressing Ctrl+L (Ô+L for Macs).
As with all tone edits, you should make a Levels adjustment first. At the
very least, take a look at the histogram and see how the data fall on the
tone curve. The tone curve for our image shows an absence of white in
the image.
3. Move the white slider to the left, to the bottom of the histogram hill.
By moving the slider, you get a full tonal range, but the main subject is
too dark. You can see some subtle tonal separation in the foggy sky.

4. To make a second Levels edit, move the Gamma slider a little to the
left to lighten up the main subject.
The picture lightens up, but it looks flat and lacks contrast, as you can
see in the image on the left of Figure 6-18.
Figure 6-18: The original photographer image (left) gets adjusted with Levels (right).
5. Adjust contrast.
Next, try adding a contrast increase layer to bump up the contrast. (We
cover this edit in detail in Chapter 7.) You can see the results of using
the contrast increase layer on the right of Figure 6-18.
The result you can achieve by following the steps in the preceding list has
more contrast, but notice that the sky is lacking tonal separation and looks
almost blank, as shown in the image on the right of Figure 6-18. This is what
we meant by no free lunch when tone editing. To get more contrast in the
midtones, you have to lose contrast and tonal separation in the highlights.
With many files, this loss doesn’t matter, but in this file, it destroys the mood
of the image.
As an alternative to using just the Levels and a contrast increase curve, this
time, edit the same file by using the Shadows/Highlights tool and compare
edits. You can’t forget Levels entirely because all your tone edits always
begin with a Levels adjustment.
127
Chapter 6: Correcting Contrast

128
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
To use the Shadows/Highlights tool for making a contrast boost, follow these
steps:
1. If you haven’t done so already, make the edits in the Levels dialog box
described in the preceding step list.
2. Select Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/Highlights to open the
Shadows/Highlights dialog box.
When the dialog box opens, the shadow slider is set to 25% by default.
This image needs a little more correction than that, so move the slider
to 35%. This setting opens the dark tones nicely, without changing the
lighter image tones.
3. While you have the dialog box open, move the Highlights slider right
to a 5% setting. This slider adjustment adds some nice tonal separation
to the bright sky. Only the brightest tones in the image are darkened.
The image is much improved. The main subject has lightened nicely, and
the background sky has maintained its original tonal separation. Click
OK in the Shadow/Highlights dialog box when finished.
4. Open the Levels dialog box by pressing Ctrl+L (Ô+L for Macs).
After your Shadows/Highlights edit, the image is still a little dark overall,
so you need to make a final pass
through the Levels dialog box
settings to lighten the image a bit
and tweak the black and white
points one final time.
5. Move the Gamma slider
slightly to the left to add a
little more brightness to the
image and then move the
black- and white-point sliders a
little farther into the histogram
to add more brilliance to the
image.
The results of the Levels adjust-
ments are shown in Figure 6-19.
Look at Figure 6-20, which shows the edit made with the Levels and contrast
adjustment layer on the left and the file edited by using the Shadows/
Highlights tool on the right.
You can also use the tool subtly to add small amounts of shadow detail
enhancement. It’s not just for fixing big errors. In Figure 6-21, you can see
the original photo on the left; when editing the right image, we used a 15%
Shadow slider move to open up the dark background and show more details,
such as the rose leaves. The edit didn’t change the foreground flowers at all.
Figure 6-19: Our final Levels adjustments to the
photographer image.

Figure 6-20: The photographer on the left was edited using a contrast increase curve; on the right, he got
worked over by the Shadows/Highlights tool.

the foreground flowers.

Chapter 6: Correcting Contrast

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Take care when you use the Shadows/Highlights tool: Because of the masks
that the tool uses, extreme edits can cause haloing, an effect you can see in
Figure 6-22, and other generally strange-looking results.
Figure 6-22: Haloing doesn’t make the photographer in this image 
look heavenly.
The Auto mask in the Shadows/Highlights tool has a very soft edge and will
cause halo effects near darker edges. In Figure 6-23, we set the Shadow slider
to 100%. This extreme move causes a large loss of midtone tonal separation.
If you use the Shadows/Highlights tool carefully, you can greatly improve
problem files, but pushing the sliders to extremes can produce unsatisfactory
results.
For files that need major repairs to brightness and contrast problems, you’re
probably better off using another method. You can find these other methods
in Part III, where we cover correcting a variety of snapshot files.

Figure 6-23: The photographer looks a little strange without his midtone 
tonal separation.
Traveling Back in Time with the Undo Command
If you don’t like the edits you make to some of your images, never fear: You
can select the Undo command (Ctrl+Z for PCs, Ô+Z for Macs; or Edit➪Undo)
to undo edits you make while using the Levels dialog box and other tools
that don’t provide you with options for reediting the last applied settings.
Elements also permits you to travel back in time (well, sort of) in your edits.
For example, if you apply a Levels edit or perform other editing tasks and
want to undo a series of steps, you can select the Undo command repeatedly,
undoing several edits.
You can control the number of undos you can perform in the General
Preferences dialog box. Press Ctrl+K (Ô+K for Macs), or select Edit➪
Preferences (Windows) or Photoshop Elements➪Preferences (Mac), to open
the General Preferences dialog box. As shown in Figure 6-24, the default
number of History states is 50. You have an undo available for each History
state. For just about any editing session, 50 states is sufficient. You can
increase the number, but doing so gobbles up some valuable memory.
131
Chapter 6: Correcting Contrast

132
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Figure 6-24: You can change the number of undos available in the 
History States text box.
You can also perform undos via the
History palette, which records the
number of states you set in the
General Preferences. Again, by default,
that number is 50. Select Window➪
Undo History, and the Undo History
palette (shown in Figure 6-25) opens.
Click any state listed in the Undo
History palette, and you travel back to
that edit. All states after the selected
state are undone.
When you perform tonal and color cor-
rections, you may need to experiment
periodically and travel through a
series of steps to view a result. If you
don’t like the result, you can choose to
Undo back to the last step that you want to keep as part of your edits.
Sometimes, you may find completely starting over more practical than undo-
ing edits. If this is the case, select Edit➪Revert. Your file then reverts back to
the last saved image. However, you still have access to the states recorded in
the History palette up to the number identified in the General Preferences.
If, for some reason, you use Revert and then want to go back to an edit prior to
reverting to the last saved version, just click the state you want that appears
prior to the Revert state.

Using Adjustment Layers
In This Chapter
 Understanding adjustment layers
 Creating Levels and Curves adjustment layers
 Modifying adjustment layer attributes
 Decreasing and increasing contrast with adjustment layers
I
n this chapter, we extend our discussion on brightness and contrast editing,
which we begin in Chapters 5 and 6, to include working with adjustment
layers. In this chapter, you can find out how to create adjustment layers
and why adjustment layers can often be the best choice for making tonal 
corrections on problem files. Hopefully, this chapter can help you not only
appreciate the flexibility you have working with adjustment layers, but also
begin to routinely use these layers.
An adjustment layer is a special layer created from several 
different editing options, and you can view and manipu-
late this layer in the Layers palette. You can reopen the
layer you create to show the last settings you applied
in various editing dialog boxes, and you can reedit
those settings. This kind of flexibility provides you
with opportunities to tweak and refine edits you
make for settings, such as brightness and contrast
adjustments.
In addition, in the Chapter 7 folder on the companion
Web site for this book, we provide two Curves adjust-
ment layers we created in Photoshop that you can apply
to your images in Elements. These layers significantly
enhance the types of contrast corrections you can do in
Elements.

134
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Adding Adjustment Layers 
to Your Editing Arsenal
You may, at first, find using adjustment layers a little confusing, but there’s
nothing to be afraid of. An adjustment layer works exactly the same as an
image adjustment, but the advantage is that an adjustment layer gives you
the ability to revisit the adjustment at any time and change the settings.
For example, if you apply a Levels correction and click OK, the only edit you
can make is to immediately undo the edit. After that, you’re stuck with the
correction. If you later want to tweak the tone points, you can’t go back
to the same Levels settings you last applied. However, if you use a Levels
adjustment layer, you can make several edits after you make a Levels 
correction, and then you can go back to the same Levels adjustment and
rework the sliders.
All of the editing options in the Levels dialog box are available to you as
adjustment layers. All of the options in the adjustment layers work the same
as they do in the dialog box, but as reeditable Layer options instead of just
image-editing commands.
Creating Adjustment Layers
You create adjustment layers in Elements by using a menu command.
When you create an adjustment layer, the dialog box for the type of adjust-
ment layer you’re working with opens, and you can apply settings options.
When you click OK in the dialog box, a new adjustment layer is added in the
Layers palette.
You can see the options available to you when creating adjustment layers
in Figure 7-1. Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer and make a choice
from the submenu that appears. Both Levels and Brightness/Contrast,
which we talk about in Chapter 6, are available as adjustment layers in this
submenu.
To create an adjustment layer and return to the adjustment layer for revising
edits, follow these steps:
1. Open a file that you want to edit by using Levels in Full Edit mode
(Standard Edit mode in Elements 4 on the Mac).
Choose any file you want to edit, using any one of the number of methods
we cover in Chapters 5 and 6 for using the Levels tool. The file you use
for these steps isn’t as important as understanding the process of creat-
ing a Levels adjustment layer.

Figure 7-1: Select an option from the New Adjustment Layer submenu 
to create a new adjustment layer.
2. Select Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪Levels (or press Ctrl+L on PCs,
Ô+L on Macs) to open the New Layer dialog box.
In the dialog box, you can type a descriptive name for your layer or
leave the default name, as shown in Figure 7-2. In our example, we use
the default name, Layer 1, for the layer. Click OK.
Figure 7-2: In the New Layer dialog box, type a name (or leave the 
default name) and click OK.
135
Chapter 7: Using Adjustment Layers

136
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
3. Make adjustments to the black, white, and Gamma sliders as needed
for the image you’re editing. Click OK when you’re done.
The Levels adjustment is applied to your image.
4. Reopen the Layers dialog box by pressing Ctrl+L (Ô+L for Macs).
When you open the Layers dialog box, you see the last edits you made.
For example, if you moved the Gamma slider to 1.5, you see the Gamma
slider at 1.5 when you reopen the Layers dialog box. Click Cancel in the
Levels dialog.
5. Double-click the Levels adjust-
ment layer in the Layers palette
to reopen the Levels dialog box.
As shown in Figure 7-3, you see
a thumbnail graph of the Levels
dialog box in the Layers palette.
Double-click the left thumbnail,
shown in Figure 7-3, to reopen
the Levels dialog box.
6. Make any changes you want
in the Levels dialog box and
click OK.
The new edits are applied to the
image.
The layers are stackable, meaning you can add several layers to any file. You can
create multiple adjustment layers and even multiple adjustment layers of the
same type.
As a matter of practice, you should always try to make tone adjustments by
using adjustment layers. You never know when you may need to return to a
particular edit, especially for color corrections. Make brightness adjustments
first, then go about correcting color. If you need to return to a brightness cor-
rection, adjustment layers afford you that opportunity.
For information on using adjustment layers for color correction, see Chapter 8.
Working with Adjustment Layers
Photoshop Elements is truly a great program that offers many options for
making quick fixes for fast results. A lot of these options just don’t appear in
more sophisticated programs, such as Adobe Photoshop. However, for all the
great features Elements offers, it also has some limitations. Among the most
limiting absences in Elements is the lack of a tool for adjusting individual
tone points. You can accomplish just so much in the Levels dialog box by
making adjustments to the white point, the black point, and the Gamma.
Figure 7-3: The Layers palette allows you to
see all the layers you’re working with.

What Elements needs is a tool to make more precise tonal adjustments, but it
simply doesn’t exist. As a workaround, you can borrow a number of custom
settings, using tools in Adobe Photoshop, and introduce the custom settings
into an Elements workspace. You don’t need to purchase Adobe Photoshop
to use such custom settings because we’ve uploaded the files you need to the
Chapter 7 folder on the companion Web site. Keep these files stored on your
computer, and you can make the same tone adjustments described in the
remainder of this chapter.
Changing the opacity of layers
You can control the strength or degree of any layer by changing its opacity.
If you create a Levels adjustment layer, for example, the Opacity setting is
100% by default, but you can control the strength of the layer edits by reduc-
ing or increasing opacity.
For example, if you import a Curves
layer from Photoshop, you can’t edit
the Curves layer itself, but you can
control how much of the Curves
adjustment you use by changing the
Opacity setting of the Curves layer.
The maximum Opacity setting you
can use is 100%. The minimum is 0%,
which results in no change on layers
below the adjustment layer.
To adjust opacity, click the arrow to
the right of the Opacity option in the
Layers palette. A slider appears, as
shown in Figure 7-4. Drag the slider
back and forth to change opacity.
Your results are dynamically shown
on the image in the Image window.
Moving adjustment layers between files
You can drag adjustment layers from one image to another image. Adjustment
layers are resolution-independent, which means the file size of the image
doesn’t matter as far as the adjustment layer is concerned. For example, you
can drag an adjustment layer from a 32K file to a 10MB file. You don’t need to
worry about image resolution when using adjustment layers. The files we’ve
provided in the Chapter 7 folder on the companion Web site are small, but
they work with any file you edit in Elements.
To use the Curves adjustment layers from the companion Web site, you need
to open the files in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on Macintosh in
Elements 4).
137
Chapter 7: Using Adjustment Layers
Figure 7-4: Drag the Opacity slider to modify
the strength of an adjustment layer.

138
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Open the file you want to add the Curves adjustment layer to and position
both the file and the adjustment layer in view in the Image window. Select one
of the Curves adjustment layers to make it active and observe the Layers
palette. You should see the adjustment layer in the Layers palette. Click the
adjustment layer and drag it to the top of the image you’re editing, as shown
in Figure 7-5. We set the Curves layer opacity at 50% as our default setting.
To add more of the curve effect, move the Opacity slider toward 100%. To
decrease the effect, move the Opacity slider toward 0%.
When you click an image in the image window, the image becomes the active
document. The Layers palette shows you all the layers in the active document.
In Figure 7-5, the contrastIncreaseCurve.tif file is the active document,
and as such, the Layers palette shows you the adjustment layer in that file.
When you drag the adjustment layer to another file, a copy of the adjustment
layer is added to the target file, and that file then becomes the active docu-
ment. Dragging an adjustment layer between files doesn’t delete the layer
from the original file.
Figure 7-5: Drag an adjustment layer from the Layers palette to the image you’re editing.
Click the adjustment layer and drag it on top of the image you are editing.

Choosing a layer blending mode
Another option you have when using adjustment layers is choosing a blend-
ing mode. By default, the Normal mode is set as the blending mode. Click
Normal or the arrow to the right of Normal in the Layers palette to see a long
list of blending mode options, shown in Figure 7-6. When you select one of
the options, the layer in which you change the mode uses the selected mode
attributes to blend with the lower layers in the layer stack.
For a good many of the tone edits we make by using adjustment layers, we
choose the Luminosity blend mode. This blend mode restricts the blending
of the adjustments to just the brightness and contrast, without changing
color saturation.
Figure 7-6: The blending mode options in the Layers palette.
Correcting Image Contrast with a Curves
Adjustment Layer
To get full control of the file tone qualities of your image, you need a means
of modifying image contrast with a high-quality editing tool, such as Curves.
Curves is a classic tool from Photoshop that allows you to have full control of
the tone qualities of a file. You can use Curves to modify any tonal area of a
file, along with changing contrast, and Curves can do everything that the
Levels tool can do, as well.
139
Chapter 7: Using Adjustment Layers

140
Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Unfortunately, Elements 5 doesn’t have a real version of Curves as an adjust-
ment layer, and the new Adjust Color Curves tool introduced in Elements 5 is
a poor effort at duplicating the Curves dialog box in Photoshop. (See Chapter 6
for more information on using the Adjust Color Curves feature.)
However, we have a solution to the problem: You can load a Curves adjust-
ment layer created in Photoshop into any 8-bit file in Elements! You can’t edit
the curve itself, but you can choose the amount of the Curves adjustment
you want to use by changing the Opacity setting of the Curves layer.
By using just a pair of Levels and Curves adjustment layers, you can have full
control of your image brightness and contrast, with far better quality than
you can get by using the standard Elements editing tools. By using a Levels
adjustment layer along with a Curves adjustment layer, you can enjoy full
control of image brightness, black and white points, and overall contrast with
just two layers. Not all files need a contrast change after a correct edit in
Levels, but it’s a wonderful option to have available.
Increasing image contrast
Because you can’t create a Curves adjustment layer in Photoshop Elements, we
provide two essential files that can greatly help you edit images to increase
and decrease image contrast. Check out the Wiley companion Web site and
download the folder contrastCurves from the Chapter 7 folder to follow
the steps in the following sections. You need the files
contrastDecreaseCurve.tif and contrastIncreaseCurve.tif.
Follow these steps to use a Curves adjustment layer to increase image contrast:
1. Download the contrast Curves files from the Chapter 7 folder of the
companion Web site, if you haven’t done so already.
The contrastDecreaseCurve.tif file and the contrastIncrease
Curve.tif file both appear in the same folder. Open these files in
Elements.
2. Store the files in the Photo Bin.
Click the Minimize button in the top-right corner of each file (the Dash
icon in the title bar). Minimizing the windows hides them from view, but
you can easily make the files visible by clicking the image icon in the
Photo Bin.
3. Open the Photo Bin.
The Photo Bin displays an image thumbnail preview for each open
file. To expand the Photo Bin, click the Photo Bin button, shown in
Figure 7-7. In Figure 7-7, you see the two contrast Curves files loaded in
the Photo Bin.

Figure 7-7: Click the Photo Bin button to expand the Photo Bin.
To maximize a document, click the image thumbnail in the Photo Bin.
The file opens in the Image window and becomes the active document.
4. Open a file to edit.
To follow the steps precisely, you can download the file islandView.
jpg from the Chapter 7 folder on the Wiley companion Web site.
Figure 7-8 is a photo taken in Hawaii that shows a distant view of a pretty
island seascape. It’s a nice photo, but a light haze subdued the image con-
trast. The bright sky caused the camera meter to underexpose the image

5. Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪Levels and click OK.
The Levels dialog box opens. As usual, you should start by first using
Levels to examine the file and make basic adjustments (which we
describe in Chapter 5).
6. Use the Levels preview option to set the white and black points.
This file had many little bright spots. Set the white-point slider carefully
by pressing the Alt/Option key and dragging the white slider until you
can see just a few pure white spots. Move the black-point slider a bit
into the histogram by pressing
the Alt/Option key and dragging
the black slider until you can
see a hint of pure black in the
bottom foreground. Don’t clip
the black and white points any
farther than that, or you run the
risk of posterizing important
image tones. You can see the
settings we used in our example
in Figure 7-9. The file is
improved, but it needs more
contrast for best overall quality.
For more information on using
the Alt/Option key while moving
Levels sliders, see Chapter 5.
7. To add an image contrast curve, click the Contrast Increase Curve file
in the Photo Bin and drag the Layer icon in the Layers palette onto the
Island file image window.
The layer becomes active, and the image contrast increases. At the default
Opacity setting of 50% for this
adjustment layer, the file is much
improved. At this point, you
have two adjustment layers. You
added one adjustment layer with
the Levels edit, and you added
the other adjustment layer by
dragging the Increase layer from
the Contrast Increase Curve file.
To see even more contrast, move
the Opacity slider in the Layers
palette to 100%. You can see the
Layers palette in Figure 7-10.
The result of adding the two
adjustment layers brings the file
to life with much improved
brightness and contrast.
Figure 7-10: Move the Opacity slider for the
Contrast Increase Curve to 100%.
Figure 7-9: These Levels adjustments correct
image brightness.

Now that you’ve set contrast to your liking, the image may seem a little
too dark for your taste. If you think a little lighter would be better,
making this change isn’t a problem when you use adjustment layers.
8. Click the Levels layer in the Layers palette to make the Levels layer
the active one again, and then double-click the Layers icon in the
Layers palette.
The Levels dialog box opens again, showing the last settings you made
to Levels.
9. Move the Gamma slider to the left to lighten the image, and then
move the black-point slider a few more Levels to the right to enhance
the blacks a bit more. Click OK in the Levels dialog box after making
your edits.
In our example, we moved the Gamma slider to 1.16 and the black-point
slider to 25. This final adjustment in Levels produces the image shown in
Figure 7-11.
Switching back and forth between adjustment layers to get the image tones
right where you want them isn’t unusual. In fact, it’s the main benefit of using
adjustment layers.

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Reducing image contrast
Figure 7-12 shows a surf shot that’s pretty but high in contrast and a little
underexposed. The high contrast is a result of the subject matter and the
lighting. The foreground rocks were nearly black in color, and the bright
foamy white surf is in full sunlight. The camera just wasn’t able to hold the
full tonal range.
Figure 7-12: This high-contrast surf shot needs some contrast reduction.
With this file, you need to edit first to correct the underexposure, and then
edit to reduce the overall contrast. To follow these steps precisely, you can
download the file surfRaw.tif from the Chapter 7 folder on the Wiley com-
panion Web site.
To edit a high-contrast image by using adjustment layers, follow these steps:
1. Open a high-contrast photo in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on
the Mac).

2. Select Layers➪New Adjustment Layer➪Levels to create a Levels adjust-
ment layer.
The Levels dialog box opens.
3. Adjust the black point.
Because our example file was a little underexposed, the histogram extends
full left to the full black portion of the dialog box. A standard black point
preview (holding the Alt/Option key down and clicking the black slider)
shows that a tiny move to the right (just one tone level) gives you some full
black tones, as shown in Figure 7-13. Because you want to recover some
of those shadow tones, be very careful to not over-edit the black point.
4. Press Alt/Option and drag the white-point slider until you see the first
appearance of pure white pixels, as shown in Figure 7-14.
In our example, the white point needs the most adjusting because of the
underexposure of the file. You need to make a much larger move of the
white point slider to create a few pure white highlight tones on the
bright surf.
Figure 7-13: This preview shows you when the black of the rocks begins in the image.

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
Figure 7-14: You can see when the white begins in the surf of the image with this preview.
5. Adjust the Gamma slider.
After setting the black and white
points, the image may still seem
a little too dark. A small move
of the Gamma slider to the left
lightens the file somewhat.
The settings we use for black,
white, and Gamma in our exam-
ple appear in Figure 7-15.
The bright surf in our example
is lacking in tonal separation
and the darkest rocks are lack-
ing in shadow detail because of
excessive image contrast, as
shown in Figure 7-16.
Figure 7-15: Levels adjustments for white
point, black point, and Gamma can help you get
the image you want.

Figure 7-16: The Levels adjustments lighten the image of the surf and really bring out its details.
6. Open the Contrast Decrease Curve file in the Image window.
If you opened the contrast Curves files that you downloaded from the
Chapter 7 folder on the Wiley companion Web site, your Contrast
Decrease Curve file should be in the Photo Bin. Click the Photo Bin icon
to open the Photo Bin and click the Contrast Decrease Curve file to max-
imize it and make it the active document. In the Layers palette, you can
see the Curves adjustment layer.
7. Drag the Curves adjustment layer in the Contrast Decrease Curve file
to the Image window on the file you’re editing (in our example, the
surfRaw.tif file).
You end up with essentially the same view in the Layers palette as
shown in Figure 7-10. At the default Opacity setting of 50%, the photo
already has an improved contrast reduction.
147

Part II: Image Brightness and Contrast Corrections 
8. Increase opacity to further reduce contrast.
A little more contrast reduction might give you the visual look you’re after.
In our example, we push the Opacity slider in the Layers palette to the
right and bring the Opacity up to 76%, which reduces the contrast more.
After we finish adjusting the contrast reduction curve, the file still seems
a little too dark to us. (Remember that these judgments are subjective.
Using the Photoshop Elements tone controls allows you to have the
image exactly the way you want it.)
9. To lighten the image a little more, click the Levels adjustment layer
and double-click the left icon to open the Levels dialog box again and
make a Gamma slider adjustment.
Move the Gamma slider to lighten the image. We moved the slider left
toward black a little to lighten up the file to suit our taste. (The actual
Gamma setting we used was 1.36.) Click OK after making the edit. The
final edited image appears in Figure 7-17.

Color Corrections

T
his part contains the meat of the book.
These ﬁve chapters help you discover color
correction and many different methods for solving
a variety of different color problems.
We start by discussing how to identify colorcasts
and color problems in Chapter 8, then we move
on to Chapter 9, the ﬁrst of the technique chap-
ters, in which we talk about correcting skin tones.
In Chapter 10, we introduce additional tools you
can use for color correction. Chapter 11 helps
you learn advanced color correction techniques.
We ﬁnish off this section with Chapter 12, which
talks about color correction as it speciﬁcally
relates to camera raw images.

T
he Holy Grail of digital image editing is the art of color correction. Probably
no editing issue is more confusing to folks figuring out how to use image-
editing software. The fact that a program such as Photoshop Elements has
such an array of different tools to use doesn’t help. Some of these tools are
automatic, and others are fully manual. However, with all the automatic tools
and methods that Photoshop Elements provides you to correct color in your
pictures, you may find figuring out where to use them pretty tough.
To help simplify matters for you, this chapter gives you some basic
steps to help you identify color problems. We cover how to fix
many of these color problems in Chapters 9 through 12. In
this chapter, we stick to viewing photos and identifying
any problems.
In most cases, first getting the tonal quality of your
file corrected makes color correction much easier. If
you want to know more about adjusting tonal cor-
rection, look over Chapters 5 through 7.
Identifying a Colorcast
What do you do if, after you finish doing your best to cor-
rect the brightness and contrast on your photos, the color
still just doesn’t look quite right? Most of the time, an excess of a
primary color (or two) in the file is causing the problem.
When your image has a primary-color problem, you typically see a colorcast,
which means that all of the photo colors are tinted a particular color, and the

152
Part III: Color Corrections 
photo just doesn’t look right. Sometimes, you can very easily discover a col-
orcast if the photo in question contains any neutral grays and whites, or at
least some colors very close to neutral gray. You may find photos that lack
neutrals or contain only bright vivid colors more difficult to correct, and you
can have problems identifying the particular colorcast in those photos.
To start with something simple, Figure 8-1 shows a color-correct version of a
white marble statue close-up.
Figure 8-1: These ladies have all the right colors.
The photo looks normal because the tones are neutral. In Figure 8-2, you can
see the same photo, this time with colorcasts from the six basic primary
colors. (Refer to Chapter 1 for a review of the six basic primary colors.)
It’s obvious that these files have colorcasts. You can see why known grays
and near whites are the easiest to use to determine a colorcast if you observe
each of the six photos in Figure 8-2. Because whites and grays are neutral,
they take on the exact hue (color) of the colorcast.

Figure 8-2: Colorcasts from the six basic primary colors give the statue these different looks.
In Figure 8-2, you can see how Photoshop Elements defines the primary
colors. A red or yellow colorcast doesn’t necessarily jump out at you, and the
green or cyan color itself might look a little different than your own idea of
green or blue, for example. The colorcasts, as shown in Figure 8-2, represent
their appearance in the way Photoshop Elements defines them. You may find
getting familiar with the way Elements defines color very helpful as you
develop your color-editing skills.
Discovering Memory Colors
Sometimes, an image doesn’t contain any easy-to-identify neutral colors. With
that type of image, you must make a guess at the colorcast based on what are
known as memory colors. Memory colors are common hues that you know —
you have a very real expectation of what they’re supposed to look like.
Common memory colors are flesh tones, sky blues, plant greens, earth browns,
wood browns, and similar objects you can easily identify from memory. The
trick with colorcasts in memory colors is figuring out exactly what color the
colorcast is. This colorcast identification is a little harder than with neutral
colors, but with a little practice, you can do it fairly easily.

Part III: Color Corrections 
For example, in Figure 8-3, you see a snapshot with a strong green cast in 
the left image. The image really has no neutrals, but because of your color
memory, you can easily tell something isn’t right about the flesh tones. On
the right, you see a corrected image with the color making the flesh tones
look natural.
Figure 8-3: The kids on the left look a little green, but the flesh tones on the right look natural.
Figure 8-4 shows a photo with a different colorcast. Sky blues are a powerful
memory color. The red cast in the image on the left gives the sky a purplish
hue. You can easily tell something’s wrong because we all know what a sky is
supposed to look like, as shown in the image on the right. Clouds don’t nor-
mally have a pinkish color, and the plants in the image on the left are lacking
a vibrant green hue. Your color memory lets you know that the color isn’t
quite right, even if you can’t figure out exactly what’s wrong with the image.
Figure 8-4: Familiar objects, such as skies, clouds, and foliage, can help you identify colorcasts.

Getting Familiar with Color Saturation
As we explain in Chapter 1, color saturation refers to the vividness of color.
Adjusting color saturation can be an important aspect of getting the color
correct in your file. It’s perfectly all right to increase the color saturation of a
photo for extra drama or impact, such as you might want to do with a pretty
sunset. Likewise, intentionally reducing saturation can be just fine if you want
to give an image a certain mood. You can even reduce saturation completely
to create a black-and-white image.
In this book, we concentrate on showing you how to view normal saturation
in photos and edit your files for the most normal-looking color you can get.
Controlling saturation can be just as important as removing a colorcast if a
correct rendering of the image’s memory colors is the goal. Compare the
right photo in Figure 8-3, in which you see the corrected color, to Figure 8-5.
In Figure 8-5, the color is oversaturated.
Figure 8-5: This photo of the kids has too much saturation.
The color balance in this file is exactly the same as the color balance of 
the image shown on the right in Figure 8-3, but Figure 8-5 has 40 percent 
more color saturation. The skin tones look unnatural — almost cartoon-like.
155
Chapter 8: Identifying Color Problems

156
Part III: Color Corrections 
Therefore, some files can have two potential problems with color — a prob-
lem with a colorcast and also with color saturation.
Fortunately, Photoshop Elements allows you to easily correct color for both
colorcasts and color saturation. When all is said and done, you make suc-
cessful color corrections by finding and recognizing the assumed neutral
tones in a photo or by using memory colors as a reference to identify a color-
cast. You correct color in photos by removing colorcasts and adjusting color
saturation when you need to.
As with any skill you master, you need some practice at color correction. The
first step in correcting color after you make tonal adjustments is to identify
the color problems. After you know where the problems lie, you can develop
a roadmap for correcting them. In the following chapters, we talk about how
to correct images that have both colorcasts and saturation problems. Before
you jump into any of the other chapters in this part, look over many different
photos and carefully study them to try to identify color problems. The more
you practice viewing photos for the purpose of identifying color problems,
the easier all your color correcting editing tasks will be.

W
hen we were getting ready to write this book, we did a little research
to determine the most popular subject matter for color snapshots.
Our conclusion was that, by far, the most popular subjects for professional
snapshot photographers, as well as many serious amateurs, are children.
All kids have skin, so correcting flesh tones is a good place to start with 
correcting color on your pictures.
As you can read about in Chapter 8, skin tones are memory colors you can
easily identify in photos, and colorcasts and saturation problems
on skin tones are some of the easiest problems to identify.
In this chapter, we look at methods for correcting skin
tone problems in Photoshop Elements.
Correcting Skin Tones
Photoshop Elements includes an excellent tool for
correcting flesh tones called the Adjust Color for
Skin Tone tool. In fact, Elements users are one step
ahead of Photoshop users when it comes to correcting
flesh tones. The full version of Photoshop CS2 doesn’t
have the Elements Adjust Color for Skin Tone tool. (But we
wish it did.) It’s a great tool that works well on more than
90 percent of the files we’ve tried it on.

158
Part III: Color Corrections 
As we talk about in Chapter 8, the first step of correcting color is to view a
photo and identify any potential problems. In Figure 9-1, you see an outdoor
photo of a little boy in a garden. The auto white balance in the camera was
fooled by all the surrounding yellow-green leaves, so the colorcast of the
flesh tones is magenta-blue, the exact opposite of the leaf colors.
Figure 9-1: This boy’s skin tones help you identify the photo’s 
magenta-blue colorcast.
To color correct this file, use the auto color-correction option in Photoshop
Elements that corrects skin tones, the Adjust Color for Skin Tone tool. The
nice thing about the Adjust Color for Skin Tone tool is that you don’t have to
identify the colorcast to use it. It works on files needing color correction for
skin tones, and it doesn’t disturb photos that are properly color corrected.

If you want to work along with this example, you can download the boy.jpg
file from the Chapter 9 folder of the companion Web site.
To use the Adjust Color for Skin Tone tool in Elements, follow these steps:
1. Open a photo in which you see a colorcast on skin tones.
2. With the image open in Full
Edit mode (Standard Edit mode
on the Mac in Elements 4),
choose Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Adjust Color for Skin
Tone.
The Adjust Color for Skin Tone
dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 9-2.
After the dialog box opens, your
cursor changes to a target circle
with cross hairs when you place
it inside the image window.
3. Drag the Adjust Color for Skin
Tone dialog box aside by click-
ing and dragging the dialog
box’s title bar until you can
clearly see the image.
4. Move the cursor inside the image window and click a flesh-tone area
in the photo to sample a skin tone.
Elements color corrects the file based on the flesh-tone sample under
the cursor. If you get the result you want from your first sample effort,
you can just finish up by clicking OK in the Adjust Color for Skin Tone
dialog box.
For our first effort, we clicked to the right of the child’s eye, as shown in
Figure 9-3. Notice we moved the dialog box away from the photo so we
could clearly see the photo in the Image window.
The result of our first effort seems a little cool for our preferences
(too blue). The color of skin varies on the face, arms, and hands, so you
want to try different sampling points on the subject’s skin to see which
sampled area gives the most pleasing result.

dialog box to help eliminate colorcasts on skin
tones.

Part III: Color Corrections 
Figure 9-3: Move the cursor to a skin-tone area and click to sample the color.
5. (Optional.) Click the dialog box’s Reset button, move the cursor to a
different place on the skin, and click again to resample another area
of the skin tone.
For our second attempt, we sampled the little boy’s cheek. The result is
too green, as shown in Figure 9-4. The little boy has rosy cheeks, which
fooled the tool because it assumed that all the skin was as red as the
cheeks.
You should usually avoid the cheeks on most faces — especially on
photos of women, who often wear makeup. Try to pick an average area
of skin color to sample.
6. Repeat Step 5 as often as necessary to get a sample you like.
Follow Step 5, clicking Reset and clicking again on another area of skin.
Little kids have great skin with none of the battle scars many adults
have, so we sampled his hand on our third attempt.
Use the Eyedropper to sample a color.

Figure 9-4: A sample from the boy’s cheek resulted in a color shift to green.
This sample came close to perfect, but it needs just a little fine-tuning.
In the Adjust Color for Skin Tone dialog box, we can perform fine-tuning
adjustments by moving the sliders.
The result seems a tiny bit too blue for a little boy’s flesh tone. We need
to fine-tune the color result a little because we’re picky about our flesh
tones. However, if you like the result you get after clicking on a good
patch of skin, you’re finished!
7. If you want to continue tweaking the result, use the sliders in the Skin
and Ambient Light boxes to fine-tune the correction.
Here’s how you fine-tune the result after clicking the cursor on the skin.
After you click a flesh tone, the color slider tabs become visible. The box
called Skin has two sliders named Tan and Blush. The Tan slider is really
a yellow-blue fine-tuning adjustment, and the Blush slider fine-tunes the
cyan-red balance of the flesh tone. (See Figure 9-5.)
161
Chapter 9: Color Correcting Skin Tones

162
Part III: Color Corrections 
Figure 9-5: The Tan slider adjusts yellow-blue balance, and the Blush 
slider adjusts cyan-red balance.
The Ambient Light Temperature slider is actually just like the Tan slider,
but it exaggerates the edit a great deal more. You can see the Ambient
Light Temperature slider move slightly as you adjust the Tan slider. As a
rule, if the Tan slider can’t get the yellowness of the skin color where
you want it, try sampling a new area of skin before resorting to using the
Ambient Light Temperature slider.
The Tan and Blush sliders are designed for fine-tuning the color balance
of the skin color. Large moves of the sliders make small changes in the
color balance, so don’t be afraid to move them around liberally when
you’re fine-tuning.
The little boy has very fair skin,
and he’s standing in open
shade. We felt that the flesh
tone color was a little too cyan-
blue for our own personal pref-
erence, so we moved the Tan
slider to the far right to add
yellow and the Blush slider a
little to the left to add a bit of
red to the flesh tone, as shown
in Figure 9-6.
Less yellow
Less red
More yellow
More red
Much less yellow
More yellow (with a hint of red)
Figure 9-6: Move the Tan and Blush sliders to
fine-tune your skin tone adjustments.

The final result makes the little boy’s skin look the most pleasing to our eyes,
as shown in Figure 9-7. Not all files are quite that easy. In some cases, you
need to adjust the saturation of the skin color, too. As a rule, you can first
color balance a flesh tone with low or normal color saturation before you
adjust saturation.
Figure 9-7: The boy finally has a healthy skin tone after a final color correction.
You can best handle photos with excessive flesh-tone saturation by
reducing color saturation before attempting to use the Adjust Color for Skin
Tone tool, which brings us to the very important Hue/Saturation tool in
Elements.

Part III: Color Corrections 
Using the Hue/Saturation Tool
The Hue/Saturation command is one of the most important color correction
tools available to you in Elements. The command allows you to adjust the
color saturation of your entire image, or you can limit your adjustment to
include just the colors you want to change.
You can also modify the hue (color) of any primary color you want, while leav-
ing the rest of the image colors unchanged. We revisit Hue/Saturation in some
of the following sections to solve the most common color-correction problems.
We do our best to show you just the
features of the tool that you’ll need,
without boring you with esoteric tech-
niques that no one ever really uses.
You can use the Hue/Saturation com-
mand as a standard editing tool or as
an adjustment layer. To access the
Hue/Saturation dialog box, select
Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue
Saturation or press Ctrl+U (Ô+U for
Macs). To access Hue/Saturation as an
adjustment layer, select Layer➪New
Adjustment Layer➪Hue/Saturation,
and then click OK in the New Layer
dialog box that appears. Either menu
command opens the Hue/Saturation
dialog box, shown in Figure 9-8.
Understanding the Hue/
Saturation dialog box
Figure 9-8 shows the Hue/Saturation
dialog box as it appears when you first
open it, either from a menu command
or as an adjustment layer. In the
center of the dialog box, you can see
the Saturation slider. The Saturation
slider changes the saturation of all
image colors equally. You can ignore
the Hue and Lightness sliders when the
Edit menu is in the Master position.
Clicking the down arrow opens the
Edit menu, where you can make
color selections, as shown in
Figure 9-9. Picking a primary color limits the Hue/Saturation edit to just the
hue you select from the menu commands.
Figure 9-8: Adjust the color saturation of all or
a little bit of your image by using the
Hue/Saturation tool.
Figure 9-9: Click the down arrow to open the
Edit menu.

When you select Reds from the Edit menu, the slider appears at the bottom
of the Hue/Saturation dialog box under the red in the color spectrum, which
you can see on the left side of Figure 9-10. On the right side of Figure 9-10,
Blues is selected from the Edit menu, and the slider appears under the blue
area in the color spectrum. The two rainbow color bars represent a color
wheel laid out flat.
You use the eyedroppers to the left of the Preview check box to sample a
color in your open file. The eyedroppers allow you to set the Hue/Saturation
for a color that doesn’t fall exactly in the center of the six primaries in the
Edit menu. The eyedroppers are very handy if you want to work with a non-
primary color, such as orange or yellow-green.
If you keep the Preview check box checked at all times, adjustments made in
the Hue/Saturation dialog box are dynamically displayed in the Image window.
Figure 9-10: Select a color from the Edit menu (Reds on the left, Blues on the right), and the slider moves to
the respective color on the color wheel.
Editing Hue/Saturation
An initial Levels adjustment can go a long way in correcting color. You also
have the option to use the Adjust Color for Skin Tone tool to help bring skin
tones into correct color balance. But what happens when these tools don’t
do the job and your image also has a color saturation problem? To discover
when to use the Hue/Saturation tool, as compared to corrections made with
Levels and Adjust Color for Skin Tone, take a look at a photo on which you
need to use Hue/Saturation first to bring the image saturation under control.
To follow along with edits made in this section, download the swim.jpg file
from the Chapter 9 folder on the companion Web site.

Part III: Color Corrections 
Take a look at Figure 9-11. This photo looks strange for a few reasons. It’s a
little underexposed, and the white balance of the camera was set to daylight.
Light reflecting from the water created a cyan-blue cast to the photo. Even
worse, the type of inexpensive digital camera used to take the photo tends to
oversaturate the colors when the capture is underexposed. The photo looks
cartoon-like, even before we do our standard first edit in Levels.
Figure 9-11: The two in this underexposed photo 
look a little cyan-blue.
After the standard Levels edit (which we talk about in Chapter 5), the over-
saturation looks even worse. The flesh tones are clown-like, and the skin
color variation between the tanned woman and the pale little boy looks unre-
alistic, as you can see in Figure 9-12.
The high color saturation also makes the Adjust Color for Skin Tone tool act
erratically because the normally subtle differences of skin tones are so exag-
gerated because of the excessive image saturation.
But when you try to correct a saturated file such as this with the Adjust Color
for Skin Tone tool, you run into more problems. We clicked the Hue/Saturation
cursor on the girl’s forehead because her forehead gave us a good average
sample for her skin color. But the image ends up with a severe blue colorcast.
Her reddish, oversaturated skin tone caused the tool to overcorrect the file
toward blue, as you can see in Figure 9-13.

Figure 9-12: A standard Levels edit makes the 
color imbalance worse.
Figure 9-13: Sampling the young woman’s skin gives 
the image a blue colorcast and reddish skin tones.

Chapter 9: Color Correcting Skin Tones

168
Part III: Color Corrections 
Next, we tried sampling the little
boy’s chest area because it seemed
to have the purest color for the
sample. The oversaturation of the
file caused the skin tone to shift the
file color balance far too yellow in
most of the colors. The color of the
girl’s skin and the background water
don’t look like memory colors, as
you can see in Figure 9-14.
The remedy for this problem is easy.
We have to reduce color saturation
before we attempt to balance the
color. To desaturate a photo before
you make color corrections, follow
these steps:
1. Open an oversaturated photo
that features at least one person.
In our example, we use the
swim.jpg file you can down-
load from the Chapter 9 folder
on the companion Web site.
Figure 9-14: Using the boy’s skin tone as the
sample leaves the photo with too much yellow.
Minimum and maximum saturation
The Hue/Saturation slider is a powerful editing tool. The slider can completely remove all color sat-
uration or increase saturation to 100 percent overall. If you completely desaturate a photo by
moving the Saturation slider all the way to the left (0 percent), your color photo appears in black and
white, completely devoid of
color. All color saturation is
removed because full desatu-
ration converts all image
colors to gray, as the follow-
ing figure shows.
Pushing the Saturation slider
all the way to the right brings
the file color saturation to 100
percent overall (which you can
see in the following figure).
You may find this slider move
fun if you want a bizarre result,
but it’s off the scale for normal
editing purposes.

2. Select Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation to open the
Hue/Saturation dialog box.
3. Desaturate the photo.
When the Hue/Saturation dialog box opens, move the center Saturation
slider to the left to decrease overall image saturation, until the image
colors seem to have a more normal vividness. In this example, we move
the Saturation slider to –35, and the result gives the file a lower, more
normal color-saturation appearance, as shown in Figure 9-15. Of course,
you still have to deal with the colorcast.
Try to reduce color saturation until the image seems to appear a little
on the pastel side. You can use the Adjust Color for Skin Tone tool much
more easily on a file that’s a little low on color saturation, and you can
easily add back some color saturation by adjusting the Saturation slider in
the Hue/Saturation dialog box after you remove the colorcast.
4. Select Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin Tone to open the
Adjust Color for Skin Tone dialog box.
5. Click the cursor on an area of skin to remove any colorcast from the
file and click OK.
Figure 9-15: Moving the Saturation slider to –35 reduces the color saturation.

We clicked on the little boy’s
chest to remove the blue color-
cast in our example. The skin
tones now look much more realis-
tic, as shown in Figure 9-16.
If you like the look of your edited
image, you’re done and can skip
the rest of the steps.
If you still want to change the
look of your image, you can now
return to the Hue/Saturation
command and further adjust the
image color saturation.
As a rule, you need to make a
final small adjustment if you had
to desaturate the file before you
color corrected it.
Now that you have pleasing flesh
tones in the example image,
maybe you think the pool water
just doesn’t look quite right.
The water color seems too dull
(desaturated). This time, use the Hue/Saturation dialog box to adjust only
the color saturation of the pool water. This is one of the best features of
the Hue/Saturation command. It allows you to modify just certain hues
(colors) in the image, without affecting the rest of the image colors. In the
professional world, this kind of change is known as local color correction.
6. Press Ctrl+U (Ô+U for Macs)
to open the Hue/Saturation
dialog box.
7. Open the Edit menu. From the
menu, pick the primary color
that you think is closest to the
color you want to modify.
In this example, we pick Cyans.
Note: Don’t worry about picking
the exactly correct primary color.
Step 8 takes care of that for you.
After you pick a primary color
from the menu, the sliders at
the bottom of the dialog box
move to the selected color
range in the color spectrum.
(See Figure 9-17.)
Figure 9-17: Select Cyans and click the left-most
eyedropper tool to modify a color in that range.
Figure 9-16: Both the tanned woman and pale
child look much more realistic.

The little eyedropper icon with the gray background is the color sam-
pler, and the gray background means it’s active and ready to use. This
eyedropper tells the Hue/Saturation command the exact color you want
to modify.
8. Move the cursor to an average-colored area of the background you
want to edit and click the mouse once to sample a color, as shown in
Figure 9-18.
Figure 9-18: Click an area of the water to sample
a hue you want to saturate.
The color slider on the bottom of the Hue/Saturation dialog box moves
slightly when you sample a color. The eyedropper sampler centers the
color slider to the exact hue you pick with the cursor.
You can actually set the color menu to any color, even if that color isn’t
close to the hue (color) you want to modify. After you click the color
sampling eyedropper on the image color you want, the color menu
resets itself to the color you chose automatically.

Part III: Color Corrections 
9. Add saturation to the selected hue.
The saturation edit needed for the background water is subjective.
We wanted the background to match the foreground people, so we
moved the Saturation slider to the right, to +25 percent. Because we
selected just Cyan hues for the edit, only the water changes, as shown in
Figure 9-19, and the flesh tones stay the same.
Figure 9-19: The swimmers photo after saturating the Cyans +25 percent.

Correcting flesh tones involves using the Adjust Color for Flesh Tone tool,
along with adjusting overall color saturation, to give the photo a natural
appearance. When your photos have saturation problems, always make a sat-
uration adjustment before adjusting for tone and color corrections.
Removing a Colorcast
The Adjust Color for Flesh Tone tool works by comparing a known reference
color to the flesh color in the file you select with the tool cursor. Elements
then automatically calculates the color change needed to remove the color-
cast from the image.
In techie terms, the tool works by matching a target color (your file), to a ref-
erence color (a flesh tone stored in memory).
The Remove Color Cast tool works exactly the same way as the Adjust Color
for Flesh Tone tool. The difference is the reference color. Remove Color Cast
works by using neutral gray as the reference color. Elements then assumes
that the file area you click with the Remove Color Cast cursor is supposed to
be gray, and it changes the file color balance to make the reference area gray.
How do you know what’s really a true neutral gray in the image? Well, you
make a guess and see what happens. If you get an odd-looking result, you
simply try again.
Of course, the tool is useful only in photo files that contain some neutral colors,
but many photos have a neutral area to sample if you look for it hard enough.
The area you sample doesn’t have to be a perfect middle gray. Light or dark
grays can work well, too. To use the Remove Color Cast tool, follow these steps:
1. Open a file containing a colorcast and a neutral gray.
To follow our example in these steps, download the file greenCast.jpg
from the Chapter 9 folder of the Wiley companion Web site.
In Figure 9-20, you see one of the authors photographed with a digital
point-and-shoot camera. The color balance has a greenish cast. The pho-
tographer had her camera set on daylight balance, and the room was lit
with fluorescent lighting, resulting in the green colorcast.
Because the room has a lot of neutral colors, the Remove Color Cast tool
will work well on this image.

2. Select Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast to open the Remove
Color Cast dialog box, shown in Figure 9-21.
Figure 9-21: You can correct a colorcast by using the Remove Color Cast 
dialog box.

3. Sample a gray color in the photo.
Because you can’t be sure where the best neutral gray in the image is
located, simply make a guess to determine the best place to click the
cursor in the image. If you like the result you get with your first sample,
you don’t need to follow the rest of the steps. Just save your work —
you’re done!
For our first try, we clicked the cursor inside the paint trim on the
back wall. The result looks too blue. The paint stripe must have been a
warm gray. Adjusting the paint stripe’s warm gray to perfect gray by
using the cursor made the overall color balance too cool, as shown in
Figure 9-22.
Figure 9-22: A click on the paint trim in the photo produces 
this too-blue appearance.

4. (Optional.) Make a second sample.
If you don’t like the result of Step 3, just click the cursor somewhere else
in the image. You don’t need to reset the tool each time, as you did with
the Adjust Color for Flesh Tone tool. Next, we click the cover cloth hang-
ing off of the exam table. It appears to be a white cloth, so it should give
us a neutral color.
This sample produces a much better result, but the photo still has a
slight magenta colorcast, as shown on Figure 9-23. The white cloth must
have picked up some reflected green light from the green floor.
Figure 9-23: A sample from the exam table’s white cloth makes 
the picture look slightly magenta.

5. Continue sampling until the image appears with a correct color balance.
You can continue clicking to sample neutral grays, blacks, and whites
until you see the photo come into a good color balance. We clicked this
time on the side of the exam table cover sheet. The sampled area seems
to be just right, and the overall color balance looks normal, as shown in
Figure 9-24.
Figure 9-24: The sample from the side of the exam table brings 
the colors into balance.
Keep in mind that it takes far longer to read this procedure than it took us to
make three sample clicks. If you don’t like the results you get, just keep click-
ing around until you see a result that looks good.

Using Levels and Color Variations
to Make Color Corrections
In This Chapter
 Adjusting color with Levels
 Using Color Variations
T
wo useful tools for color correction in Photoshop Elements are Levels
and Color Variations. We cover how to use Levels for tone corrections in
Chapter 5, but Levels has much more to offer than just adjusting brightness
and contrast: You can also use Levels to correct color.
In addition to Levels, Elements provides you a more visual approach to
color correction with the Color Variations dialog box. These two
tools, combined with the Hue/Saturation, Adjust Color for Skin
Tone, and Remove Color Cast tools (which we discuss in
Chapter 9), provide you with flexibility and numerous
options for correcting color.
In this chapter, you discover how to use Levels for
color correction and how to use the Color Variations
dialog box for visual color corrections.
Using Levels for Color Correction
The Remove Color Cast command, which we discuss in
Chapter 9, is actually a tool that’s been around since the
very first version of Photoshop. It’s really not new: Elements
just gave it a fancy new name. The tool in its original form is still
with us in the Levels dialog box, as an eyedropper.
In the Levels dialog box, you can see three eyedropper icons. From left to
right, they’re the White, Gray, and Black eyedroppers. For now, just pay atten-
tion to the Gray eyedropper, shown in Figure 10-1.

180
Part III: Color Corrections 
Figure 10-1: You can use the Gray eyedropper, in the center, to sample 
midtone grays.
This eyedropper works exactly like the sampler in the Remove Color Cast
command we discuss in Chapter 9. There’s no difference at all in its function,
but there are real advantages to using the Gray eyedropper in Levels rather
than the Remove Color Cast tool:
 You can use the Gray eyedropper right after doing your basic Levels
tonal edit if the file has some gray values to reference.
 The Levels Gray eyedropper works on 16-bit files, whereas Remove
Color Cast and many of the other color correction tools work only 
on 8-bit images.
 You can use Levels as an adjustment layer, which can have many advan-
tages if you want to change your mind later, as we discuss in Chapter 7.
 It allows you to use the Gray eyedropper in combination with other color
correction tools, if you wish, when used as an adjustment layer (for exam-
ple, a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer and a Levels adjustment layer).
 You can actually reset the Gray eyedropper to a different color of your
choice, if needed. We discuss this eyedropper adjustment in Chapter 11
when we talk more about advanced color-correction techniques.
The Gray eyedropper

Correcting color by using Levels
To use Levels for color correction, follow these steps:
1. Open a file with a colorcast problem.
For this series of steps, we use the gym.jpg file that you can download
from the Chapter 10 folder of the companion Web site. The picture was
shot to show off a brand-new high school gymnasium. The camera white
balance was set for fluorescent lighting; but the gym had Mercury Vapor
lights, and the result was a severe cyan-green colorcast, as you can see
in Figure 10-2. To make things even more difficult, a small amount of nat-
ural outside light was coming in from some doors behind the camera.
Although the picture doesn’t have any obvious gray areas to sample,
click around inside the image by guesswork and see if you can bring
the image into a more reasonable color balance.
Figure 10-2: The lighting in this gym gave the photo a cyan-green colorcast.
2. Press Ctrl+L (Ô+L for Macs) or select Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪
Levels to open the Levels dialog box.
3. Click the middle eyedropper (the Gray eyedropper) in the Levels
dialog box to activate it.
When the cursor moves into the image area, the eyedropper appears
with a gray fill.
181
Chapter 10: Using Levels and Color Variations to Make Color Corrections

182
Part III: Color Corrections 
4. Sample a gray area in the photo.
Take a guess, click an image sample, and see what happens. If you don’t
like the result, just click again somewhere else in the image. If you hit the
right sample the first time, you’re done! No need to follow the rest of the
steps in this list.
As a first effort, we tried clicking on the neutral-looking folded gym seats.
The resulting color balance was too cyan-blue, as shown in Figure 10-3.
The folded seats must be a warm tan color.
Figure 10-3: This version of the gym photo has a cyan-blue colorcast.
5. (Optional.) Sample a second gray area in the photo.
If the first attempt doesn’t bring the image into color balance, click in
another area of the photo.
This time, we tried clicking on one of the doors on the rear wall. The result
is much better, but the photo looks a little too yellow-green overall, as
shown in Figure 10-4.
6. Continue sampling colors until the image appears balanced in color.
Last, we sampled the ceiling in the upper-right corner. This sample gave
us the result we liked best.
Note: The gym ceiling is actually painted white, but it’s lit mainly by
reflected light from the floor, so the ceiling tends to take on the color
of the floor. As you can see in the final result, shown in Figure 10-5, the
ceiling is many different shades of white, from cool to warm.

Figure 10-4: In this edited image, the gym has a yellow-green colorcast.
This is a common situation in all color photography. Just because you
know that an object in the photo was really white or gray doesn’t guar-
antee you’ll get a perfect color balance from sampling that object. Color
reflection from the lighting environment can tint the neutrals, which
leads to errors in color sampling. So, just keep on clicking until you find
the right spot!
Figure 10-5: The third time’s a charm, giving us a color-balanced image.

Chapter 10: Using Levels and Color Variations to Make Color Corrections

184
Part III: Color Corrections 
Image saturation should be normal or undersaturated for best results. A file
with high color saturation makes the Remove Color Cast command, or the
Gray eyedropper in Levels, much more difficult to use. Do your best to nor-
malize the overall image color saturation with the Hue/Saturation command’s
Saturation slider, if needed, before you try to color balance the image. (See
Chapter 9 for reducing saturation by using the Hue/Saturation tool.)
Analyzing the Levels adjustments
When you use Levels to correct color, you can review the tone distribution as
you make adjustments. Levels provides you feedback not only for the result
in the composite image, but also when you view each color channel. (You can
access Red, Green, and Blue channel information in the Levels dialog box.)
In this section, we take a look at what really happens to the tone distribution
when you follow the steps in the preceding section.
After you click the Gray eyedropper in the image, the color balance changes,
and you might notice that the histogram seems to change, too. Elements
makes changes in all three color channels in order to bring your file into
color balance. You can see what actually happens when you click the
Gray eyedropper by viewing the individual Red, Green, and Blue channel 
histograms.
Clicking the Channel menu in the Levels dialog box reveals the separate 
channel options available. To view the individual color channels, select Red,
Green, or Blue from the menu options. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+1
(Ô+1 for Macs), Ctrl+2 (Ô+2 for Macs), and Ctrl+3 (Ô+3 for Macs) to view the
Red, Green, and Blue channels, respectively. Ctrl+~ (Ô+~ for Macs) returns
you to the composite RGB channel. Note that these keyboard shortcuts work
only when the Levels dialog box is open.
The separate color channel histograms, shown in Figure 10-6, all look some-
what different from each other because you’re looking at information from a
full-color photograph. The proportions of the different colors vary. The his-
tograms all match only if the entire image is comprised of nothing but pure
gray tones.
Also, the Gamma sliders in all three channels have moved away from the
center position. That channel move is the result of using the Gray eyedrop-
per. Elements moves the individual color channel Gamma sliders to brighten
or darken Red, Green, and Blue primary color components to change the
overall color balance of the file.
You can also move the Gamma sliders manually in each channel to modify the
image color balance, if you want. We tell you more about that in Chapter 11.

Figure 10-6: Histograms for the Red, Green, and Blue channels after Levels edits.
Working with Color Variations
Another very useful tool in Elements for color correction is a command
called Color Variations. Color Variations is a visual color-correction tool that
allows you to make color-balance judgments by using visual comparisons.
Color Variations is a throwback to the classic days of making color prints in
a darkroom. To help determine the best color settings when making color
prints from color negatives, the photographer printed a set of color varia-
tions. The color variations were based on the six basic primary colors and
helped a great deal when the photographer was trying to determine what set-
tings would help eliminate a colorcast. This proof set is called a ring around.
The color variations followed the classic layout of the color wheel, hence the
name ring around.
The Color Variations command in Elements follows the same general idea,
but you might find the labeling a little confusing at first. To open the Color
Variations dialog box, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations.
The Color Variations dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-7.
At the top of the dialog box, you can see the Before and After image windows.
The Before window always shows you the original state of your image, and
the After window shows the real-time results of any editing changes you
make in Color Variations.
At the bottom-left of the dialog box, you can find the Select Area of Image to
Adjust radio boxes and the Adjust Color Amount slider. Moving the Adjust
Color Amount slider increases and decreases the overall amount of color
you apply when you click a ring-around thumbnail in the Color Variations
dialog box.

186
Part III: Color Corrections 
Figure 10-7: With the Color Variations dialog box, color corrections are at your fingertips.
Actually, leaving the Midtones radio button selected under Select Area of
Image to Adjust radio boxes allows you to make changes to the color balance
of the entire image, not just the midtones. We recommend always leaving the
default midtone setting when you use Color Variations for color balancing
your image. Using the Shadows or Highlights settings destroys your black-
and white-point settings in Levels and tints the real whites and blacks. If you
already set your white and black points in Levels (which we talk about in
Chapter 5), you don’t want to mess that up by using Color Variations.
(Remember, always make your tonal adjustments first in Levels.)
In the center of the dialog box, under Use Buttons Below to Adjust Your
Image, you can see the Color Variations options — the ring around. Below
each thumbnail, you see a text description for what happens when you click
that thumbnail. For example, click the top-left corner thumbnail, and you
increase reds, as described in the text below the thumbnail. You can click any
one of the six thumbnails repeatedly to add or remove primary colors.

Using the Color Variations command is fairly straightforward. By default, the
tool is set to affect the midtones. You simply click the cursor over the ring-
around color option you like in the dialog box, and the result appears in the
After image preview.
The Amount slider is a little heavy-handed at the default setting. We suggest
moving it a little to the left, as shown in Figure 10-8, in order to make the file
changes less severe with each click on a color-option thumbnail.
Figure 10-8: To apply more subtle corrections, move the Amount slider to the left.
We think the color labeling in the Color Variations dialog box is a bit confus-
ing. We modified the text in the dialog box in Figure 10-9 to show you how it
would look if the six primary colors were all actually identified in the dialog box.
Figure 10-9: We relabeled the color options according to the six primary colors.

Part III: Color Corrections 
As you can see, the complementary colors (the opposites) are placed one
above the other. To help understand the concept a little more, take a look at
the color wheel we introduce in Chapter 1 (Figure 10-10). You can clearly see
the color complements in the color wheel.
Figure 10-10: The color wheel clearly shows the complementary 
colors.
Correcting color with Color Variations
Color Variations is purely an eyeball editing tool. If you have reasonably good
color vision, using Color Variations is easy and straightforward. To gain a
little practice at using Color Variations, follow these steps:
1. Open an image in Elements.
A photo that appears a little too cool or a little too warm would be best
to use for these steps. For this example, we use the sunrise.jpg file,
which you can download from the Chapter 10 folder on the companion
Web site.
Red
Magenta
(Red + Blue)
Yellow
(Red + Green)
Blue
Green
Cyan
(Green + Blue)

We start with the sunrise photo shown in Figure 10-11. The colors of a
twilight scene are very subjective. We felt that the sunrise as captured
by our digital camera looked a little on the cool side. We prefer a warmer
morning look. But we’re not exactly sure what particular color balance
would look best, which makes this photo a good candidate for the visual
judgments we can make in Color Variations.
Figure 10-11: This sunrise image looks a little too cool.
2. Select Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations to open the Color
Variations dialog box.
When the Color Variations dialog box opens, you can quickly view a
number of color balance variations until you see what you like best.
3. Reduce intensity by moving the Adjust Color Amount slider one place
to the left and leaving the Midtones radio button selected.
189
Chapter 10: Using Levels and Color Variations to Make Color Corrections

Part III: Color Corrections 
4. Add a warmer tone to the image by adding some yellow and a little
red to the overall color balance.
To add some yellow, click the Decrease Blue option three times.
(Remember, yellow is the opposite of blue. Decreasing blue adds
yellow to the photo.)
Clicking three times on the Decrease Blue thumbnail produces the effect
shown in Figure 10-12.
Figure 10-12: We clicked the Decrease Blue thumbnail to get this warmer sunrise image.
The added yellow seemed to put us on the right track, but adding a
little red to the file will make it look just right for our taste. (Adding
some red with the yellow in combination results in adding some
“orange” to the file.)
We click the Increase Red option twice, and the After preview shows us
the overall color balance we like best. You can see the final result in
Figure 10-13.

Figure 10-13: The final edited sunrise image after adding more red.
Darkening and lightening images
On the far right of the Color Variations dialog box, you can see the Lighten
and Darken options. Should you use them?
Using these options to make small final adjustments to your file after you get the
color where you want it is okay. But keep in mind that your initial edit in Levels
should have gotten your overall image brightness close to where it should be.
(You did edit first in Levels, right? We cover Levels edits in Chapter 5.) As a
matter of practice, you shouldn’t have to use the Darken and Lighten options in
the Color Variations dialog box, except for some last-minute subtle adjustments.
Saturating images with Color Variations
Color Variations enables you to make changes to an image’s saturation.
Remember, however, that although you can use the Color Variations tool to
make final slight adjustments to an image, the Hue/Saturation command we
discuss in Chapter 9 gives you far more control for changing image saturation.
191
Chapter 10: Using Levels and Color Variations to Make Color Corrections

192
Part III: Color Corrections 
For this example, we chose a file that needs correct color rendition rather
than a subjective color balance for a pleasing mood.
To adjust image saturation with the Color Variations tool, follow these steps:
1. Open an image in Elements in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on
the Mac in Elements 4).
To follow our example in these steps, download the file classroom.jpg
from the Chapter 10 folder on the Wiley companion Web site.
Figure 10-14 is a picture shot for a high school yearbook. The classroom
had some kind of warm white fluorescent lighting, and the digital camera
auto white balance did a poor job of guessing the correct white balance
setting. The result is an image with a yellow-green colorcast.
Figure 10-14: This classroom photo has a strong yellow-green colorcast.
The lighting isn’t color consistent in this file, so Color Variations is a
good choice to color balance the image.
2. Open the Color Variations dialog box by selecting Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Color Variations.
3. To reduce the yellow in the file, add blue to the file (because blue is
the opposite of yellow).
If you need to, quickly review the color wheel in Figure 10-10 to confirm
the complementary color you need.

Figure 10-15 shows the image after we click the Increase Blue option twice
to begin our corrections. The picture is improved, but it’s still not quite
right.
Figure 10-15: Clicking Increase Blue reduces the colorcast, but the 
classroom still needs a little work.
A colorcast is seldom composed of a single primary color, such as red or
yellow. You usually need to adjust two primaries to get the file looking
just right.
4. Remove some green in the file by clicking the Remove Green option,
and then click OK.
Viewing the Color Variations thumbnails confirms that the file seems to
have an excess of green after we remove the excess yellow from the col-
orcast in Step 3. A single click on the Remove Green option brings the
file to a pleasing and more realistic color balance. You can see the final
result in Figure 10-16.
You can also use Color Variations to color balance the flesh tones or grays in
any file if you’re comfortable enough using the command. Color Variations
is also a good training tool when you’re figuring out how to recognize color-
casts. Working with opposite color primaries to neutralize a colorcast is the
basic skill you need to correct your color photos like a professional.

T
hroughout this book, we show you techniques that work well for most of
the color problems you’ll encounter with your digital photographs.
However, you can’t properly correct some color problems with the
methods we describe in Chapters 8 through 10. So, for the
more courageous Elements users, we want to introduce a
few custom color-correction methods that the profes-
sionals commonly use.
In this chapter, we talk about some advanced color
correction methods you should try when you can’t
seem to correct images with the techniques we
describe in earlier chapters.
Cleaning Up the Whites
Figure 11-1 is a photo of a child’s first theatrical appear-
ance, shot by a proud parent. The stage lights provided the
lighting, which resulted in a severe yellow-red colorcast. If you

196
Part III: Color Corrections 
tried to fix this file with any of the methods we demonstrate in earlier chap-
ters, you’d probably be heading back to the bookstore for a full refund.
Figure 11-1: This school production photo has a strong yellow colorcast.
We tried our best to correct this photo by using Levels and Color Variations
methods that you can find in Chapter 10. We set the black and white points in
the Levels dialog box and used the Color Variations tool to reduce the excess
yellow and red from the file, but the results look very bad. The little white
fence is pink, the flesh tones look strange, and the little girls’ dresses are a
sickly-looking yellow-green, as shown in Figure 11-2. We couldn’t get one hue
right without ruining another. What went wrong?
The camera white balance was far too warm, and the photo was underex-
posed, so the Blue and Green channels are far more underexposed than the
Red channel. The file has an orange colorcast, but that colorcast is much
more severe in the highlights. That’s why the standard color correction meth-
ods don’t work with this file.
In the professional world, we’d say that the three color channels aren’t linear,
or in other words, the color channels have different tonal ranges. We have to
fix the channels independently in order to make the color look normal.

Figure 11-2: Our best Levels and Color Variations correction effort left 
the image still looking terrible.
For this file, you can actually fix the individual channel tonal ranges very
easily. Just use the Auto Levels command to correct the color in this file.
Open the Levels dialog box and click the Auto button. Alternatively, you can
select Enhance➪Auto Levels or press Shift+Ctrl+L (Shift+Ô+L for Macs). With
a single click, the file looks better. Most of the colorcast is gone, as shown in
Figure 11-3.
Figure 11-3: A single click on Auto Levels improves the little 
performers’ image.

Chapter 11 folder on the Wiley com-
panion Web site. We use this file to
examine the tone curve in individual
channels, using the Levels dialog
box. Your first stop is viewing the
default RGB channel. Open the
Levels dialog box (Ctrl+L for PCs,
Ô+L for Macs), and you see the his-
togram reporting the tone distribu-
tion in the composite RGB channel.
The histogram looks fairly normal, as
shown in Figure 11-4.
To examine the different color chan-
nels while you have the Levels dialog 
box open, select the channels from the Channel menu. An easier method is to
use keyboard shortcuts. Press Ctrl+1 (Ô+1 for Macs) to see the Red channel,
Ctrl+2 (Ô+2 for Macs) to see the Green channel, and Ctrl+3 (Ô+3 for Macs) to
see the Blue channel. You can see the histograms for each of the individual
channels in Figure 11-5.
Figure 11-5: Histograms for the Red, Green, and Blue channels.
Figure 11-4: The Levels dialog box shows
that the kidsPlay.jpg photo has a normal
tone curve.

What do the histograms tell you? Looking at the Red channel histogram, 
you can see red in the highlights of the image. (The data on the right side of
the histogram represents the highlight information.) In the Green channel,
the histogram shows only a little data in the highlights. A tiny bit of data
appear to the right of the midtone point in this channel. In the Blue channel
histogram, you see no data to the right of the midtone point toward the 
highlight area. This histogram indicates that no blue exists in the highlights
at all.
From looking at these histograms, you can tell that this image has a lot of
orange in the highlights. (A lot of red mixed with a little green makes orange.
Go back to the kindergarten lesson we give in Chapter 1 to figure out the
results of mixing colors.)
In this photo, the right side of the histogram for each of the three channels is
very different. Because the file should show some true white tones (such as
in the picket fence), the histogram white points have to match up in order 
to bring the highlight values into an accurate neutral color balance. You 
can’t fix the color balance across the entire tonal range until you set a white
point by evening up the histogram white points. Because the standard edits
for making Levels and Color Variations adjustments that we describe in
Chapter 10 can’t do the job, you need to use another method for setting the
white point.
Using Auto Levels
To edit the file shown in Figure 11-1, you can use the Auto Levels option in
Elements. When you use Levels to make tone adjustments in the composite
channel, all channels are equally edited with the same tone adjustments. We
suggest you use Auto Levels because this option applies a custom Levels edit
that sets each individual color channel’s white point to equalize the tonal
range in each channel. Here’s how to do it:
1. Open the kidsPlay.jpg file in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode
on the Mac in Elements 4).
You can download the file from the Chapter 11 folder of the Wiley com-
panion Web site.
2. Open the Levels dialog box (Ctrl+L on PCs, Ô+L on Macs).
3. Click the Auto button in the Levels dialog box.

Chapter 11: Advanced Color-Correction Methods

Part III: Color Corrections 
You can also use the Enhance➪Auto Levels menu command. Using this
command makes the same edit, but it doesn’t give you the option of
examining what happened in each channel. For this series of steps, use
the Levels dialog box and click Auto so you can then examine the indi-
vidual channels to see how Elements moves the tone points.
After you make a Levels adjustment in the Levels dialog box, the new
slider positions appear under the histograms for each channel. When
you click OK in Levels, the tone curve is remapped according to your
adjustments. However, if you reopen the Levels dialog box, the histogram
shows the new tone point mapping, but the black, white, and Gamma
sliders return to their default positions.
4. Select the Red channel from the Channel menu or press Ctrl+1 (Ô+1
for Macs).
Continue examining each of the three individual color channels, choos-
ing Green and then Blue from the Channel menu or pressing their short-
cut keys (Ctrl+2 for PCs or Ô+2 for Macs, Ctrl+3 for PCs or Ô+3 for Macs,
respectively). In Figure 11-6, you can see the three color channels after
the Auto Levels adjustment in Step 3. The white-point slider moves to
the left in the Green and Blue channels. Seeing the neutral highlights in
the photo clean up nicely confirms that using Auto Levels was the cor-
rect editing move.
Figure 11-6: The three color channels after the Auto Levels adjustment.
5. Adjust the Gamma slider to the left, to the 1.18 position.
Auto Levels evened out the color channels in Step 3, but you can still
tweak the file a little for the very best result. With the Levels dialog box
open, make some final adjustments to image brightness and readjust the
white and black points. In this step, you move the Gamma slider to the
left to lighten the image overall in the RGB composite channel.
6. Move the black-point slider right, to the 18 position.

7. Adjust the white point by moving the slider left, to the 248 position.
This small move of the white-point slider adds a little extra sparkle to
the highlights. You can see the final result, after all edits in the RGB com-
posite channel, in Figure 11-7.
Figure 11-7: This final edited image shows the girls at their color-correct best.
Keep in mind that you can also use Hue/Saturation, Color Variations, or any
of the other color correction tools after you make the Auto Levels edit to
bring your file to perfection. We liked the look of this file with a little extra
saturation to enhance the mood of the stage lighting, so we didn’t bother
making a Hue/Saturation adjustment.
Almost any file with heavy colorcasts in neutral highlight areas can benefit
from a pass through Auto Levels.
Figure 11-8 gives another example of how Auto Levels can bring a photo into
a good tonal range. The photo on the left, an unedited image shot with a digi-
tal camera, is an average snapshot with a heavy highlight colorcast. On the
right, you see the image edited with a single pass in Auto Levels. The image’s
large areas of real white tones allow Auto Levels to do a good job.

Part III: Color Corrections 
Figure 11-8: A snapshot with a heavy highlight colorcast (on the left) and edited with Auto Levels (on the right).
Be very selective with your use of Auto Levels. Unlike the Auto Contrast 
command (which we talk about in Chapter 6), Auto Levels can cause large,
unnatural, color shifts in files that lack real white values because Auto Levels
tries to create some white pixels, even if the photo has no real white values.
Carefully examine your photo for true whites before applying the Auto Levels
command.
In Figure 11-9, an adjustment made with Auto Levels just didn’t work. The file
contains no neutral values at all. When you use the Auto Levels adjustment,
the file is completely ruined because the image has no neutral highlights.
We had to edit this file by using custom edits with the Levels tool, the Adjust
Color for Skin Tone command, and the Hue/Saturation tool, all of which we
describe in earlier chapters. The final result is a pleasing overall color bal-
ance, as shown in Figure 11-10.

Part III: Color Corrections 
Setting White and Black Points 
with the Levels Eyedroppers
You can’t fix all files with severe highlight colorcasts by using Auto Levels. A
file with clipped white- or black-tone areas can fool Auto Levels, making the
Auto Levels feature not function as it should. Files with pure white and black
areas don’t work at all with Auto Levels.
With these types of images, you have to take control and reset all the color-
channel white and black points manually. Figure 11-11 shows you an example
of the type of image that needs manual white- and black-point adjustments.
This photo was shot in a mixed-lighting environment. The background is
much more yellow than the foreground. The ceiling light fixtures and the sign
in the background are the brightest tones in the file.
Figure 11-11: This photo of cheerleaders in a school gym has a strong 
colorcast.
What happens when you use Auto Levels on this kind of image? Auto Levels
sets the white point to those bright values in the sign and light fixtures. The
result doesn’t look very good, even though some real white tones exist in the
main subject, as you can see after we apply Auto Levels in Figure 11-12.
You can find the solution to the problem in the Levels dialog box — the 
Black and White eyedroppers. These eyedroppers allow you to set a black or
white point based on the area you select in the image. You have full control;
Elements doesn’t just make a guess for you. This control also allows you to
ignore areas of the photo that aren’t important to the main subject.

Figure 11-12: The cheerleaders still don’t look color-balanced after an 
Auto Levels edit.
By default, the Black and White eyedroppers are set to full black and white.
You want to neutralize the colorcasts without clipping the tones in the his-
togram. It can be difficult to guess exactly where the full white tones are in a
file with a colorcast, so you need to reset the eyedroppers to very light gray
and very dark gray rather than pure white and black. After you correct the
colorcasts, you can fine-tune the white and black points just like any other
file. It sounds complicated, but it’s really easy. After you correct colorcasts
by using the eyedroppers a few times, it becomes second nature. Just follow
these steps:
1. Open the cheers.jpg file, which you can download from the
Chapter 11 folder on the Wiley companion Web site.
2. Open the Levels dialog box (Ctrl+L for PCs, Ô+L for Macs).
3. Double-click the White eyedropper in the Levels dialog box to open
the Color Picker, as shown in Figure 11-13.
The White eyedropper is the third eyedropper to the right, below the
Auto button. Because this dialog box is the Color Picker for the White
eyedropper, the words “Select target highlight color” appear at the top
of the dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-13.
At the top left of the large color box, you can see a small half-circle. This
half-circle shows you the color selected for the White eyedropper. The
eyedropper is positioned at the full-white default position. The far left
side of the color box is all gray tones, with white on top and black on the
bottom.

206
Part III: Color Corrections 
Figure 11-13: In the Color Picker, set all RGB color values to 230 to 
change white to light gray.
4. Set the White eyedropper color to a light gray by typing 230 in each of
the R, G, and B text boxes, and then click OK to close the Color Picker.
You can find the RGB value display on the right of the dialog box. (The R,
G, and B values for white are always each 255.) To reset the White eye-
dropper to light gray, simply type values in the RGB text boxes. To set
the eyedropper color to a light gray, you use 230 for all three RGB
values, as you can see in Figure 11-13. (Alternatively, you can click and
drag the circle in the color spectrum, but getting a precise value by
dragging the circle is a little bit of a chore.)
A change occurs in the before-and-after sample box at the top-right of
the color box. At the top of this box, you can see your new color selec-
tion. (The bottom half of the box represents the default color before you
made a color change.)
After you click OK, the White eyedropper is now set to light gray.
5. Much like you did for the White eyedropper, double-click the Black
eyedropper in the Levels dialog box.
The same Color Picker opens again, except this time, the text over the
Color Picker box says “Select target shadow color,” and the target circle is
on the bottom-left, set to full black (the RGB values are shown at 0, 0, 0).

6. Type 25 in all three RGB value text boxes. Click OK in the Color
Picker, and both eyedroppers are set and ready to go.
After you’ve done this a few times, custom setting the eyedroppers takes
about five seconds.
7. Set the white point in the photo.
The cheerleader uniforms have what seems to be pure white trim on the
top. You can use that as your target area for the White eyedropper. (The
cheerleaders’ white socks and shoes would make good targets, also.)
Click the White eyedropper cursor in the Levels dialog box. Move the
cursor to the photo and click the brightest white area you can find on the
uniform. In Figure 11-14, we clicked on the uniform of the girl on the far
right. (When you move the eyedropper to the photo, you can click any-
where in the photo to reset white to the area you click.) The eyedropper
sets the value to a neutral light gray, and the highlights clean up nicely.
Figure 11-14: Click the White eyedropper in a bright area of the photo, 
the uniform of one of the girls.
8. Set the black point in the photo by clicking the Black eyedropper tool
in the Levels dialog box and then clicking the tall, black speaker, as
shown in Figure 11-15.
Set the black point to a known neutral black area to ensure all the color
channels reasonably match each other for the main subject of the photo.
The tall, black speaker cabinet in the background is a good choice
because you know it’s probably a neutral tone and it’s in the same light-
ing as the cheerleaders.

Figure 11-15: Click the Black eyedropper in the darkest area of the 
photo, the speaker cabinet.
Note: If you notice any hue change in the highlights after you set the
black point, click the White eyedropper on your highlight target again. If
you guessed correctly for your white and black targets, the image color
balance looks much improved.
9. Manually set the white point by moving the white-point slider.
With the Levels dialog box still open, complete the edit by setting full
white and black points.
Note: Because you set the White and Black eyedroppers to light and dark
gray to avoid tone clipping, you have to make a final, manual adjustment,
using the white- and black-point sliders in Levels. This adjustment ensures
the best possible tone quality in the file.
Press Alt/Option to see a preview in Levels. Move the Levels white-point
slider until you just begin to see a few white pixels in the white areas
of the cheerleader’s uniforms. The image should appear similar to
Figure 11-16.
10. Manually set the black point by pressing the Alt/Option key and
moving the black-point slider until you see the first appearance of
black in the main subject.
Move the black-point slider until you begin to see a few black pixels in
the black areas just behind the cheerleaders. Ignore the shadow clipping
on the ceiling because that area isn’t important to the main subject.
Your screen should appear similar to Figure 11-17.

Figure 11-16: Move the white-point slider until you see the first 
appearance of the girls’ white uniforms.
11. Make a Gamma adjustment by moving the Gamma slider to the left.
After Step 10, the file looks much improved, but wait: There’s more to be
done! The image looks a little too dark, so moving the Gamma slider to
the left lightens it up nicely.

With the image lightened, you can see that the cheerleaders seem to be
standing on neutral-colored mats.
12. Click the Gray eyedropper in the Levels dialog box and click the fore-
ground area on the mat (see Figure 11-18) to get a small improvement
in the color balance for the main subject.
Those mats must have been a true gray tone: The color balance is
improved after the adjustment.
Figure 11-18: Click the gym mat with the Gray eyedropper to improve 
the color balance.
13. Complete the Levels edit by clicking OK to
save the changes and close the dialog box.
After you click OK, a dialog box appears (as
shown in Figure 11-19) asking if you want to
save the new target colors as defaults.
14. Click No.
Clicking Yes leaves your custom settings in
place for any photos you open with
Elements in the future.
If you click Yes by mistake, don’t panic. Just open the White and Black
eyedropper Color Pickers and reset them to full black (0, 0, 0) and pure
white (255, 255, 255). Be sure to click Yes when the prompt appears again.
Figure 11-19: A dialog box asks
if you want to save the new

The last problem with this file is the strong, yellow saturation in the
background. The gym must
have had some sodium vapor
lights back there. An adjustment
with Hue/Saturation can help
solve the problem.
15. Select Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Hue/Saturation or press
Ctrl+U (Ô+U for Macs) to open

16. Select Yellow from the Edit

Moving the Saturation slider left
to –20 percent (see Figure 11-20)
brings the yellow saturation
under control without affecting
the main subject too much.
The final edited image appears in Figure 11-21.

Part III: Color Corrections 
At first, you may find these edits take up a lot of time. With a little practice,
however, making these kinds of edits can become second nature. The real key
to working fast is carefully analyzing your file to determine what tools and
steps you need to make corrections. After you know where you want to go
with your corrections, making those corrections is a breeze.
Fine-Tuning with the Hue/
Saturation Command
In an ideal digital world, setting a perfect gray balance in your digital file
would give you perfect reproduction of all the color captured in your photo.
In the real world, you can seldom achieve perfect color-reproduction 
accuracy in digital imaging, but fortunately, you don’t really need absolute
perfection to get pleasing results. You don’t usually have the opportunity to
compare your final color output to the original scene captured, so you don’t
often notice small errors in hue
reproduction.
Digital cameras have inherent hue-
reproduction errors. Creating a
camera profile that will work in all
shooting conditions is almost impos-
sible. Additionally, different brands
and types of digital cameras each
have their own unique color signa-
tures, just as different color films had
in the analog film photography days.
If you’ve worked hard to edit and
color correct your file, but a memory
color still doesn’t look quite right,
this is the section for you.
Figure 11-22 shows a snapshot from a
theme park. We followed all the rules
and tried to balance the file with
methods we describe earlier in the
book, but we wound up with a
strange-looking sky.
Figure 11-22: This photo of a theme park castle
looks less than royal.

The sky color has an excess of
magenta (not enough green), and it
just looks strange. All the other
memory colors look just fine. If you
try using Color Variations to produce
a normal-looking sky, the rest of the
image winds up with a greenish col-
orcast. We clicked twice on Increase
Green in the Color Variations dialog
box, and the photo ends up looking
like Figure 11-23.
The solution to the problem lies in
correcting only the blue-cyan por-
tions of the photo because the other
hues seem to look just fine. To per-
form this kind of edit, you need to
use the Hue/Saturation command.
To follow these steps, download
the castle.jpg file from the
Chapter 11 folder of the Wiley
companion Web site. To use
Hue/Saturation to fix the problem
shown in Figure 11-22, just follow
these steps:
1. Open the castle.jpg file in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit on the
Mac in Elements 4).
2. Open the Hue/Saturation dialog box by selecting Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation or pressing Ctrl+U (Ô+U on Macs).
3. Adjust the blue hue to correct the sky color by selecting Blues from
the Edit menu.
4. Click the left eyedropper to open the Color Picker and then click in the
sky area to set the exact blue color in the Hue/Saturation command.
Moving the Hue slider adds the adjoining primary color to the hue you
select in the Edit menu in Step 3. The color gradient at the bottom of the
dialog box shows you the degree of change your edits make, as does your
image preview. Extreme moves of the Hue slider can change the target
color you select into a completely different hue, making the Hue/Saturation
command function just like the Replace Color command. (Hue/Saturation
and Replace Color are really the same tool, but with differing controls.)
213
Chapter 11: Advanced Color-Correction Methods

clicking twice on Increase Green in Color
Variations.

214
Part III: Color Corrections 
For color correction, you need to make only modest adjustments in
Hue/Saturation.
To adjust the sky hue, first look at the color gradient at the bottom of the
Hue/Saturation dialog box. The gradient color to the left (in the lower-left
corner of the dialog box) looks more like the real color of a sky. The right
side shows a more cyan hue that adds more green to the sky color.
5. Move the Hue slider to the left until the sky looks right.
That’s all there is to it. All other blue hues in the photo similar to the sky
receive the same color edit.
The blue spires on the castle also change color, as you can see in
Figure 11-24.
Figure 11-24: Adjusting Blues changes the blue of the spires, as well as the sky.

6. Adjust lightness and saturation by moving the Saturation slider to +58
and the Lightness slider to –67.
The sky now looks correct, and you didn’t change the color balance 
in the rest of the image. You can also change the brightness and satura-
tion of your target color at the same time, if you want. In the first edit,
you color correct the sky. You can darken the sky and add a little more
saturation to the sky’s blue by adjusting the Saturation and Lightness
sliders.
You can think of the Lightness slider as the Add White or Black slider.
Keep in mind that any change you make to the targeted image color with
the Lightness slider results in a loss of saturation (black and white have
no saturation). Add saturation with the Saturation slider after you
change the Lightness setting if you want to maintain the original amount
of saturation in the target color. In our example, you make a large move
of the Lighten slider toward darken, to +58, so you need a large move of
the Saturation slider (–67) to add saturation to the resulting darkened
sky. You can see the final edited image in Figure 11-25.

Hue/Saturation.

Part III: Color Corrections 
Always do your best to bring a file into the best overall color balance before
you resort to the Hue/Saturation command for local color-correction control,
but feel free to use Hue/Saturation to fix a problem color in a file when all the
other memory colors look normal.
Correcting Overexposed Saturated Files
Chapter 5 covers working with overexposed files. In this chapter, we want to
talk about working with overexposed saturated images — we constantly hear
about these kinds of problem images from amateur photographers.
Light-metering systems in point-and-shoot digital cameras vary a great deal
from brand to brand. Some are pretty accurate, whereas others seem to have
a tendency toward always shooting a little light or dark, depending on the
camera.
You can usually edit underexposed photos far more easily because the impor-
tant highlight detail is preserved; the viewer tends to see shadow detail,
which you often lose in overexposed images, as less important than rich
highlight detail.
Overexposed files can suffer from severe clipping in important highlight
regions of the image; colorful subject matter combined with overexposure
can create severe loss of tonal separation in the brightest saturated colors.
The best remedy for this problem is understanding your camera’s default ten-
dencies and modifying the camera setup properties to prevent the problem
from happening. If you find that your camera tends to generally over- or
underexpose your digital files, use the available metering system overrides 
to try to solve the problem.
If your pictures constantly come out overexposed, set your metering option
to expose less, in general, for your photos. Most cameras have an option for
setting exposure in plus (+) or minus (–) values, usually in ƒ1⁄2 or full f-stop
increments. Try setting the camera to a ƒ1⁄2 f-stop (– ƒ1⁄2) option and leave it
there by default for general picture taking. Remember, the default setting 
isn’t really correct if your photos always look too light and have blown-out
highlights.
Inversely, if your photos come out too dark most of the time, you need to
override the camera metering system to add a little exposure for most situa-
tions. Setting the override option to + ƒ1⁄2 or 1 f-stop should solve the problem.

Remember, the correct setting is the
one that works best for you and the
kind of photos you like to shoot.
When your metering system fails or
you’re working with lighting condi-
tions that leave you with an overex-
posed photo, you need to adjust the
tonal balance. Figure 11-26 shows
you a typical example of an overex-
posed, highly color-saturated image.
The dark background fooled the
camera metering system, and the
foreground blossom was overex-
posed as a result.
If you like shooting pictures of flow-
ers, you’ll run into this kind of a
problem a lot. Shooting flowers in full
sunshine isn’t really the best idea if
you like doing close-ups — soft light
works much better. But sometimes
you don’t have a choice and end up
with an overexposed image. To cor-
rect an overexposed image, follow these steps:
1. Open the photo daffodil.jpg,
which you can download from
the Chapter 11 folder on the
Wiley companion Web site, 
and examine the histogram
in Levels.
After opening the photo in Full
Edit mode (Standard Edit on the
Mac in Elements 4), press Ctrl+L
(Ô+L for Macs). The histogram
shown in the Levels dialog box
in Figure 11-27 confirms some
highlight clipping and lack of a
full, rich black in the shadows.
217
Chapter 11: Advanced Color-Correction Methods
Figure 11-26: This daffodil is overexposed and
highly saturated.
Figure 11-27: The Levels histogram shows a
lack of full black, as displayed by the absence
of tones on the left side of the histogram.

218
Part III: Color Corrections 
2. Press Ctrl+3 (Ô+3 on a Mac) to open the Blue channel.
The daffodil blossom is mostly a very saturated yellow, so the blossom
has almost no blue color. A quick check of the Blue channel in Levels
(Figure 11-28) shows that there’s no highlight clipping, so some
unclipped tonal information is still in the photo.
Figure 11-28: An examination of the Blue channel 
shows no highlight clipping and some shadow data 
in the histogram.
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could transfer the Blue channel information to
the clipped Red and Green channels? Well, you do have a way! You simply
have to desaturate the file first before you begin any further editing.
A fully saturated color is one that’s composed of just one or two color
channels. The flower is yellow. Red and green make yellow on your 
monitor, so the blossom is almost all red and green. When we desaturate
the file, Hue/Saturation has to add some blue to the yellow flower.
Desaturation really just adds the complementary color. So, when you
desaturate the file, Hue/Saturation takes information from the Blue chan-
nel and adds it to the Red and Green channels. You recover some of the
lost tonal separation in the saturated yellow blossom.
3. To desaturate the photo, open the Hue/Saturation dialog box (Ctrl+U
for PCs, Ô+U for Macs). Leave the Edit menu at the default selection of
Master.
4. Move the Saturation slider to reduce file saturation by –40 percent.
The file looks very pastel at this point, but that’s normal for this kind of
file recovery. Don’t worry; you can increase saturation if you need to
later, after you finish your edit.
After the desaturation edit, the histogram shows a nice recovery of high-
light information. You can’t see much highlight clipping in Figure 11-29.

Figure 11-29: After the desaturation edit, the Levels 
histogram shows a nice recovery of the highlight 
information on the right.
5. To adjust the Gamma, open
Levels (Ctrl+L for PCs, Ô+L for
Macs), leave the black- and
white-point settings as they
are, and make a big Gamma
slider move to the right, to
0.50, to darken the file.
You need to enhance the high-
light tonal separation as much
as possible. You’re just looking
for a nice increase in tonal sepa-
ration in the blossom, so don’t
worry about the overall dark-
ness of the rest of the file. You
can see the result of this edit in
Figure 11-30.
The color saturation of the blos-
som increases a great deal after
the Gamma adjustment. The
Gamma adjustment, which you
make to darken the image,
increases contrast in the high-
lights. Increasing contrast
always results in increased satu-
ration, unless you do the edit in Luminosity mode with a Levels adjust-
ment layer, as we describe in Chapter 7. In this example, the saturation
increase works in your favor.

Highlights. Move the Shadows slider to 50 percent. Leave the default
settings for Highlights and Contrast at 0 (zero).
You need to make a Shadows/Highlights adjustment to recover shadow
detail. Moving the Shadows slider opens the shadows up, but the pic-
ture’s still a little on the dark side.
7. Make some Levels adjustments for white point, black point, colorcast,
and Gamma by following these steps:
a. Click the Black eyedropper in Levels, leave it at the full black
default setting, and click the dark shadow near the center of
the image.
You can make the darkest
portions of the background
in this photo a full black
tone because those dark
areas are in deep shadow.
b. Pick the brightest petal
you can find. Click the
White eyedropper (leav-
ing it at its default setting)
and click the petal.
The small white flowers
in the background are a
good target for the White
eyedropper.
c. Click around with the
Gray eyedropper in
Levels until you find just
the right spot for a pleas-
ing color correction to
the slight cyan cast.
You can see all three
sample areas in Fig-
ure 11-31.
d. Lighten the file slightly by
moving the Gamma slider
to the right, to 1.13, and
click OK.
8. To pump up the saturation a little, open the Hue/Saturation dialog box
(Ctrl+U on a PC, Ô+U on a Mac) and move the Saturation slider to +10
percent, taking care to not overdo it and lose the tonal separation you
worked so hard to recover.
You can see the result of the final edit in Figure 11-32.

Correcting Color by Using Levels
Adobe created Photoshop Elements to provide a simplified and low-cost solu-
tion for digital image editing. Most of the color editing tools in Photoshop
Elements give the user reasonable control of image color balance and tone
characteristics, but they’re limited by design. The full-featured Curves com-
mand in Photoshop is the best tone- and color-editing tool available, by far.
Unfortunately, the Color Curves command in Elements is junk by comparison.
If Adobe added too many editing features to Elements, it could reduce
demand for Elements’ big brother, Photoshop. As a result, Elements doesn’t
contain the best controls available in Photoshop for precise manual color
correction of your files, with one important exception: the Levels command.
The full-featured Levels command in Elements allows most of the color-
balancing control available in Photoshop, but it’s a little less handy to use
than Curves. If you plan on moving up to the full version of Photoshop, 
figuring out how to use Levels as your main color-correction tool makes the

Part III: Color Corrections 
learning curve much faster in Photoshop. Plus, you can use the Levels com-
mand in Elements as an adjustment layer. Add a Hue/Saturation adjustment
layer, and almost all your editing needs will be met. (We talk about the advan-
tages of adjustment layers in Chapter 7.)
Understanding the effects 
of adjusting color in Levels
The Levels dialog box allows you to select the individual Red, Green, and
Blue color channels from the Channel menu at the top of the Levels dialog
box. Each of the individual color channels contains its own Gamma slider.
Moving the Gamma slider in a color channel dialog box changes the bright-
ness of only the individual color channel selected and therefore changes
the color balance of the entire file. This feature allows you to remove an
unwanted colorcast from a file.
In principle, correcting a colorcast is simple. Either remove the color in
excess or add its opposite (complementary) color. To understand the effects
of moving the Gamma slider in individual color channels, take a look at
Figure 11-33. This figure shows the results of selecting the three color 
channels and moving the Gamma slider left and right.
Here’s what’s going on when you make Gamma adjustments in individual
color channels in Levels:
 Red channel — Gamma left: Select Red from the Channel menu in
Levels and move the Gamma slider to the left. Only the Red channel
brightens with a shift toward red.
 Red channel — Gamma right: Moving the Red channel’s Gamma slider
to the right darkens the Red channel, resulting in a shift toward cyan.
 Green channel — Gamma left: Moving the Gamma slider left in the
Green channel shifts the image toward green.
 Green channel — Gamma right: Moving the Gamma slider right in the
Green channel shifts the image toward magenta.
 Blue channel — Gamma left: Moving the Gamma slider left in the Blue
channel shifts the image toward blue.
 Blue channel — Gamma right: Moving the Gamma slider right in the
Blue channel shifts the image toward yellow.
Try to develop an understanding of how your image changes when you make
Gamma slider moves in the individual color channels. After you know the
effects of making these adjustments, you can effectively use Levels for color
correction.

Figure 11-33: These ladies show you the colors you get when you 
move each channel’s Gamma Slider left and right.
Color correcting a file with Levels
Adjusting color balance with Levels isn’t really difficult, as long as you under-
stand how to recognize a colorcast. After you try color correcting a file with
Levels a few times, you’ll find that reading about it takes far longer than just
doing it.

If you’ve carefully calibrated your monitor for color according to the instruc-
tions in Chapter 3, you can eyeball the most pleasing color balance by using
the color channel sliders in Levels. After you complete the basic Levels edits
for the black and white point and the Gamma adjustment for overall image
brightness (we talk about these edits in Chapter 10), you can then work to cor-
rect the colorcast. To correct the colorcast by using Levels, follow these steps:
1. Open the file interior.jpg from the Chapter 11 folder on the Wiley
companion Web site in Full Edit mode (Standard Edit in Elements 4 on
the Mac).
The photo shown in Figure 11-34 is an interior photo shot for a design
company. The white balance could use some improvement. The bright
interior paint was a slightly warm white, but when viewed in Elements,
the result looks obviously off color.
Figure 11-34: This photo of an auditorium has a red-yellow colorcast.
The colorcast is red-yellow, although we aren’t exactly sure of the hue
proportions of the colorcast.
2. To correct the colorcast, adjust the Red channel first by selecting Red
from the Channel menu in Levels and then moving the Red channel
Gamma slider to the right.
Move the Red channel’s Gamma slider to the right, to 0.81, to remove
most of the red cast from the image. (Moving the slider right removes
red by adding cyan — red’s opposite color.)
3. To further correct the colorcast, adjust the Blue channel by selecting
the Blue channel from the Channel menu in Levels.

Moving the Blue channel’s Gamma slider to the left, to 1.24, adds blue to
the image, which neutralizes the yellow cast because blue is the oppo-
site of yellow.
Now that you’ve removed the yellow component of the colorcast, you
can see that the image still seems to have a little too much red, as
shown in Figure 11-35.
Figure 11-35: The auditorium still looks a little too red after Red- and 
Blue-channel Gamma adjustments.
It’s not unusual to have to work back and forth in the color channels to
get the color balance just right. Because almost all colorcasts are a mix
of two primary colors, you have to readjust as you go to get the color
just right.
4. Return to the Red channel by selecting Red from the Channel menu.
Move the Red channel’s Gamma slider a little more to the right, to
0.69, to further reduce the red cast in the image.
The color balance of the image seems to be about as close as you can
get to normal. The saturated blue color of the walls prevents an
absolutely clean color balance because of blue light reflecting onto the
more neutral surfaces, but the file looks pretty good to our eyes.
5. Brighten the image by selecting the composite RGB channel from the
Channel menu and moving the Gamma slider to the left, to 1.30.
The heavy color editing dulled the original brightness of the image, so
brightening the overall image improves its appearance.

amera raw is the file format used to capture and save all data that the
camera’s sensor can capture. This data is then processed by a special
tool in Photoshop Elements called the raw converter. What’s neat about
camera raw is that you can process an image (which means you essentially
make some settings adjustments and open the file in Photoshop Elements),
and then you can go back and process the same raw image, using different
settings.
Working with camera raw is sort of like having an opportu-
nity to process film the traditional way, using chemicals
and development time and, if you don’t like the results,
reverting the film to its state before it was processed
and processing it again using a different development
time.
Unfortunately, not all cameras support saving in
camera raw format. Many of the consumer-grade
point-and-shoot cameras give you only JPEG files
saved to your media card. If your camera doesn’t let
you save in camera raw format, you can skip this
chapter. But before you do, realize that camera raw
gives you the best image to edit in Photoshop Elements.
Why? Because it captures more data and provides you with
many more editing options.

228
Part III: Color Corrections 
Understanding Camera Raw
We use the terms raw and camera raw interchangeably in this chapter. The
term raw isn’t an acronym that stands for anything: It’s just a name for a file
format. The file name extension can vary among the camera manufacturers,
which often leads to a little confusion. File names ending with extensions
such as .crw, .mrw, or .nef signify a raw format. The different camera man-
ufacturers create these names, but the files all have common attributes. All
the files are 16-bit images, and you need to convert the raw images in a raw
converter.
Photoshop Elements provides you a raw converter when you install the pro-
gram; therefore, you don’t need special software to open a raw image.
Using the Raw Converter
If you’re familiar with the basic image-editing controls in Levels that we cover
in earlier chapters in this book, you’ll find that the controls available in the
raw converter are very similar. The only difference is the names given to the
controls.
When you open a camera raw file in Elements (you can use any mode that you
use to open files), the camera raw converter window, shown in Figure 12-1,
opens first.
Some of the important tools in this window include the following:
 Exposure: This control works just like the white-point slider in Levels.
The placement of the control determines the white point in your file.
The same rules that you use when determining the best white-point
placement in Levels apply when you set the Exposure slider. (See Part II
for white-point adjustments with Levels.)
 Shadows: This control has the same function as the black-point slider in
Levels. Its placement determines the black point in your file. You should
exercise the same care with the Shadows slider as you do with the black-
point slider when adjusting for best tonal range and shadow detail.
 Brightness: This control is really the Gamma control in the raw con-
verter, and it works exactly like the Gamma slider in Levels. You use it to
control overall image brightness.
 Contrast: This control changes the shape of the virtual tone curve in the
raw converter.

Figure 12-1: A camera raw file is first opened in the Elements raw converter.
The Contrast slider works very much like the Curves adjustment layers
we discuss in Chapter 7 and provide in the Chapter 7 folder on the Wiley
Web site. A Contrast setting with a negative value reduces midtone con-
trast, very much like the Reduce Contrast adjustment layer. Setting the
Contrast slider to a plus value increases midtone contrast and functions
like the Increase Contrast adjustment layer.
 Saturation: This slider works exactly like the Master Saturation slider in
the Hue/Saturation dialog box in Elements. Plus (+) values increase satu-
ration, and minus (–) values decrease saturation.
As with the Hue/Saturation Master saturation control, a –100 value
removes all color and produces a black-and-white image.
 White Balance: At the top-left corner of the raw converter, you can find
the White Balance tool. This eyedropper works the same as the Gray eye-
dropper in Levels. The tool sets any area sampled in the raw preview to
neutral gray. Similar to the Levels Gray eyedropper, you have to sample an
area that’s close to a real neutral value for the tool to work properly.
White Balance eyedropper
229
Chapter 12: Camera Raw Color Correction

230
Part III: Color Corrections 
 White-balance controls: These controls have a number of options for
color balancing your file. At the top, you have the White Balance pre-
sets. The White Balance menu offers a number of preset choices for your
file’s white point. (The White Balance menu is actually the overall color-
balance control.)
• Auto mode: Elements averages all the colors of the file together
and guesses at the correct color balance of the file. As a rule, the
guess is never the optimum setting, but you can give it a try and
see what happens, if you want.
• Custom mode: This mode is loaded by default when you use the
White eyedropper, and it allows you to manually set the white bal-
ance with the Temperature and Tint sliders.
• As Shot setting: This setting preloads your digital camera’s white-
point setting.
Which preset should you use? That’s easy. If the file color balance 
doesn’t look quite right, try the different presets to see if one of them
brings your file into a close color balance. Use the one that works best
for the file.
If the file contains any identifiable neutral targets, use the White Balance
eyedropper to set the color balance for you. If all else fails, you can use
the white-point sliders (labeled Temperature and Tint) to bring the file
close to where you want it.
Keep in mind that you don’t have to get the file exactly correct before
opening it in Elements. After the file is open, you can use the full range
of color-balancing and tone-control tools in Elements to get the photo
just right for your taste.
 White-balance sliders: You have two sliders for fine-tuning the white
balance:
• Temperature slider: Changes the yellow-blue balance of your file.
• Tint slider: Changes the green-magenta balance of your file.
These sliders can seem a little clunky, compared to the RGB controls in
Elements. If you need to manually adjust your white balance, we find
that the best approach is to just get it close with the raw converter
white-balance sliders and finish the color balance edit in Elements, using
the easier RGB controls.
 Depth: One of the great advantages of working with camera raw files is
working on 16-bit images. You have much more data to work with, and
edits you make in the raw converter and the Levels dialog box are more
forgiving. Adjustments you make to 16-bit files aren’t as prone to

destroying data as edits made on 8-bit files. As a matter of practice, keep
the Depth menu (located in the bottom-left corner) on 16-bit when open-
ing files from the raw converter.
 Save: When you look at the Save command, you may think that this con-
trol saves your adjustments and maybe opens the file in Elements. Not
so. Clicking Save opens a dialog box in which you can save the raw
image in Adobe DNG format. Because so many camera manufacturers
create their own version of camera raw, Adobe developed the DNG
(Digital Negative) format to try to create a standard. If you want to save
a file in DNG format, click this Save button.
 Open: After making all your settings adjustments, click Open. The file
opens in Elements in Full Edit mode.
To better understand the relationship between the adjustment sliders and
the Levels tools, take a look at Figure 12-2.
In Figure 12-2, you can see the White eyedropper in the raw converter, on the
right, connected to the midtone eyedropper in the Levels dialog box, on the
left. The black-point slider in Levels matches the Shadows slider in the raw
converter, the midtone slider in Levels matches the Brightness adjustment in
the raw converter, and the white-point slider matches the Exposure slider in
the raw converter.
The histogram in Levels differs from the one in the raw converter. The Levels
histogram is a black histogram that describes the tonal range of your images.
In the raw converter, you see a multicolored histogram.
Figure 12-2: How camera raw tools match up with the raw converter tools.

Chapter 12: Camera Raw Color Correction

Part III: Color Corrections 
In the Levels dialog box, you can select any one of the three RGB channels and
view the data represented in each of those channels. Also, you can view the
composite RGB channel in Levels. In the camera raw converter histogram, you
can see a breakdown of data in the RGB channels represented by different
colors in the histogram. The colors in the histogram represent the following
data:
 White: White in the histogram shows pixels contained in all three RGB
channels. This view is similar to the Levels histogram when you select
RGB in the channels menu.
 Red: The red informs you of pixels that appear only in the Red channel,
just as selecting Red in the Levels dialog box’s Channels menu does.
 Green: Green represents pixels only in the Green channel.
 Blue: Blue represents pixels in the Blue channel.
 Cyan: Cyan shows you a combination of data in two channels. The Cyan
color indicates an absence of pixels in the Red channel. So, Cyan shows
a combination of pixels in the Green and Blue channels.
 Magenta: Magenta indicates an absence of pixels in the Green channel.
Magenta shows a combination of pixels in the Red and Blue channels.
 Yellow: Yellow indicates an absence of pixels in the Blue channel, so
Yellow shows you a combination of pixels in the Red and Green channels.
Some higher-end cameras, such as DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) cameras,
offer you a view of your picture in the LCD screen and an option to view the
histogram for each picture in the same LCD screen. This feature is very help-
ful if you understand histograms and how they relate to tonal ranges.
Just like in the Levels dialog box, if you see the data slammed up against one
side of the histogram with little data on the opposite side, you know your
exposure is clipping data. After a quick preview on your camera’s LCD
screen, you can make some decisions about reshooting a file that you know
will present some problems when
you edit it in Elements. Perhaps
changing the camera position rela-
tive to the lighting, using a different
exposure value, adding flash, and so
on might help get the exposure right.
We want to point out another set of
adjustments in the raw converter
dialog box. Click the Detail tab in the
raw converter, and you find three
adjustment sliders, as shown in
Figure 12-3.
Figure 12-3: Clicking the Detail tab opens
another pane that has more adjustment sliders.

The three options you have include Sharpness, Luminance Smoothing, and
Color Noise Reduction. You use these sliders to adjust the amount of sharp-
ness and reduce noise (artifacts) in your file. In Figure 12-3, we’ve pushed the
sliders all the way to the left, so the raw converter makes no adjustments for
these options.
You have some better options in Elements for sharpening and reducing color
noise. As a default, keep these settings at a minimum and perform the adjust-
ments after you open a file in Full Edit mode. This book is devoted entirely 
to tone, brightness, and color correction. We don’t have the room to go into
areas such as sharpening files and reducing color noise. For a good reference
on making these adjustments, see Photoshop Elements 5 For Dummies by
Barbara Obermeier and Ted Padova (Wiley Publishing).
Making Adjustments in Camera Raw
With all the settings adjustments you can make in the raw converter, you 
may find it difficult to know exactly where to start. You should make a good
number of your corrections in Elements, using tools we describe in Chapters 5
through 11. You want to use camera raw only to get your tonal balance into a
range where you have all the data you need to further edit a file effectively by
using tools such as Levels, Hue/Saturation, Shadow/Highlight, and so on.
To follow the steps in this section exactly, download the rawImage.CR2 file
in the Chapter 11 folder on the Wiley companion Web site.
Follow these steps to edit a file in the raw converter:
1. From Full Edit mode, select File➪Open and open a raw file.
Figure 12-4 is a typical snapshot file taken with available light on a
shaded porch. When you open the image in the raw converter, the auto
settings make the picture look somewhat flat and dark.
2. Deselect the Auto check boxes in the raw converter.
By default, all the Auto adjustment buttons are enabled when the raw
converter opens. We usually turn them all off and make our edits from
scratch, which gives us more control over the final edited image.
If you shoot both camera raw and JPEG with your digital camera and you
want a raw file to match your JPEG file, just turn off all the Auto options
and open the JPEG file.
The image brightness looks fairly close to normal, as shown in Figure 12-5.
This tells us the camera exposure was close to correct.

234
Part III: Color Corrections 
Figure 12-4: These kids and their kitty are displayed in the raw converter.
Figure 12-5: With auto correction turned off, the happy gang looks brighter.

The clipping preview is on, and the image preview shows some highlight
clipping in the upper right of the image, where direct sunlight is falling
on the wall of the house. If you plan to crop off that part of the image
later, just ignore the clipping warning to the right and set your white
point in relation to the main subject.
3. Adjust the white point by moving the Exposure slider to the right to
increase exposure.
Moving the Exposure slider to the right has the same editing result as
moving the white-point slider to the left in Levels. Move it too far, and
you clip important highlight detail in important image areas of your
photo. In our example, we went a little too far, and you can see the red
clipping warning in the bright portions of the girl’s dress, as shown in
Figure 12-6.
Figure 12-6: The red specks on the girl’s dress are a clipping warning.

236
Part III: Color Corrections 
4. Fine-tune the white-point adjustment.
Usually, the first move you make for adjusting the white point (as you
did by moving the Exposure slider in Step 3) gets you into a general
range for setting the correct white point. If your first move isn’t just
right, move the slider farther or back it off, depending on the view you
see in the image window. In this example, we moved the slider a little too
much. We back off the Exposure slider a little until the clipping warning
disappears on the dress, as shown in Figure 12-7.
Figure 12-7: Adjust the Exposure to eliminate the red clipping in the photo.
5. Adjust the black point by moving the Shadow slider to 2.
With the Shadow slider at 2, the shadow clipping warning disappears
from the subject.
At the default 5 position on the Shadow slider, you can see some of the
blue shadow clipping warning in the preview. To maintain as much
shadow detail in the kids as you can get, back off the shadow slider to 2
or until the shadow clipping warning almost disappears from the main
subject. We can’t quite eliminate all the clipping, but we can get close, as
you can see in Figure 12-8.

Figure 12-8: Adjust the Shadows, Brightness, and Contrast sliders.
6. Adjust brightness by moving the Brightness slider right to 60.
The Brightness slider is similar to the Gamma control in Levels. The
image seems a little too dark, so you can lighten it up by moving the
slider to the right, to 60. The Brightness slider works backward from the
Gamma slider in Levels. Move the slider to the right to brighten rather
than left, as you do with the Gamma slider in Levels. (See Figure 12-8.)
7. Adjust the contrast by moving the Contrast slider slightly to the right.
After you adjust the image brightness in Step 6, add a little more con-
trast to the image. A small move of the Contrast slider to the right makes
the image contrast look just right, as shown in Figure 12-8.
Note: The Contrast slider in the Elements raw converter is a great tool. It
works by modifying a virtual tone curve, and it gives excellent results. If
you work with raw files in Elements, try to make your best contrast
adjustment in the raw converter.
8. Adjust for color balance by moving the Temperature slider to the right.
The tonal editing is complete, so make a critical evaluation of the image
color balance. In this photo, the image has a slightly cool cast overall
(blue), so a small move of the Temperature slider to the right adds a
237
Chapter 12: Camera Raw Color Correction

238
Part III: Color Corrections 
little yellow to the image (Figure
12-9). The added warmth gives
the photo the right mood, as
shown in Figure 12-10.
9. Leave the Saturation slider in
the default position.
Never change image saturation in the raw converter because using the
Hue/Saturation command in Elements gives you far better control over
the final results.
10. Click Open in the raw converter, and the file opens in Elements in
Full Edit mode.
You can see the results of the edits in Figure 12-10.
Figure 12-10: These four camera-raw characters look ready to be edited in Elements.
To see how the raw file compares to a JPEG file opened in Elements, compare
Figure 12-10 with Figure 12-11. In Figure 12-11, we opened the same photo
saved as a JPEG file. The JPEG file appears flat and out of color balance com-
pared to the raw image.
Figure 12-9: Adjust the Temperature slider to
remove a colorcast.

Figure 12-11: The three kids and their cat as a JPEG, opened in Elements.
Working with Camera Raw Defaults
When you open an image in the camera raw converter and make settings
adjustments to your file, the raw converter remembers the last settings you
made. Therefore, if you want to open the raw file again in the raw converter,
the last settings you used are shown in the converter window.
At times, you may want to start from scratch and apply new edits. The nice
thing about using camera raw is that you can go back to the raw image in the
raw converter and process your file a thousand times with different settings.
To start over again and change back
to the default settings of a raw image,
click the right-pointing arrow to the
right of the Settings menu in the raw 
converter and select Camera Raw
Defaults from the menu that appears.
(See Figure 12-12.) Making this menu
selection returns your file to the
same view as when you first opened
the file in the raw converter.

fter you correct your files’ brightness, contrast, and color problems,
you’re ready to print your photos. You might output your prints to your
own desktop printer or at a photo service center. For this chapter, we cover
the aspects you need to know to print your files to desktop printers. 
Just as you carefully prepare photos for corrections, you need
to exercise care when it comes to printing. You have to
select the right paper, understand how your printer
works, and choose the right color profile.
In this chapter, you can discover how to optimize
photos for printing, and you can get some guidelines
for printing on a few of the more popular printers.
Preparing Files for Printing
You have many options for printing photographs. You
can use your own desktop color printer or a mini photo
lab, or you can even go to a service center that can print your
photos with a variety of printing devices.

244
Part IV: Finishing Work 
For your own desktop printing, you can choose to print files directly from
either editing mode or the Elements Organizer. In this chapter, we stick to
printing from the Full Edit mode (Standard Edit mode on a Mac).
Printing and image resolution
One of the most important aspects of printing your photos after you have
them properly corrected for brightness and color is image resolution. You
have three different resolutions to take into account: the resolutions of your
camera (or scanner), your photos, and your printer. Remember that image
resolution and printer resolution aren’t the same, and they don’t need to
match up to each other when you print image files (at least not in a one-to-
one relationship).
Here’s what you need to keep in mind about the different types of resolution:
 Camera/scanner resolution: If you scan pictures, you need to look at
the scanner resolution. Scanners often have two different resolutions.
One resolution is the true resolution of your scanner and the other is the
interpolated resolution. For example, say your scanner has a resolution
of 1200/2400. The first figure (and always the lowest value) is the true
resolution of your scanner. The second value is interpolated resolution,
which means that the scanner upsizes the scanned image to create more
pixels than the scanner can capture. For premium quality work, stick
with the true resolution of your scanner.
Digital cameras come in a variety of different resolutions. Most often, 
the price of a camera rises with the amount of resolution the camera can
capture. Today, even the lowest-priced cameras start out at about 4 to 5
megapixels and go up from there. A 10-or-more-megapixel camera usu-
ally costs much more than a 4- to 5-megapixel camera. The camera reso-
lution really determines how large a picture you can print. For 4-x-5-inch
photo prints, any of the least-expensive cameras will work. But if you
want to get prints of 16 x 20 inches or larger, look for a camera with a
resolution of 6 or more megapixels.
 Image resolution: Image files are measured in pixels, so we often refer to
a file’s resolution as being measured in pixels per inch (ppi). What’s the
optimum ppi your printer needs to produce a quality print? That resolu-
tion might be 300 ppi or lower. Image resolution almost never needs to
match device resolution. In other words, your Elements image doesn’t
need the same resolution as your printer is capable of producing.
When you scan an image on a flatbed or slide scanner, the scanning 
software offers options to choose image resolution and size. You pretty

much know, for example, you’ll scan an 8-x-10-inch image at 300 ppi
when you start your scan —at least that’s what resolution you should
use. With a digital camera, it’s a little more confusing. A camera captures
images at a particular size according to the number of pixels it can cap-
ture, but the resolution is always 72 ppi.
For example, you might have a camera that captures an image at 2000 x
1000 pixels. Another camera might capture an image at 3000 x 2000 pixels.
Both images are 72 ppi, but when you resize the images in Elements, the
image captured at 3000 x 2000 pixels produces a larger print than the
other image at the same output resolution.
When you’re using your own desktop printer, you may want to make
many different test prints. If the optimum resolution of your printer is
300 ppi, you might be able to obtain satisfactory prints at resolutions 
as low as 200 ppi. Lowering the resolution enables you to print larger
prints. Try to run some tests to find the resolution that produces the
quality prints you’re looking for, and you can determine how far you can
go when you need to print larger prints.
 Printer resolution: Printer resolutions are perhaps the most confusing
in the mix of the device resolutions. You hear printer resolutions such 
as 1440 x 720 from manufacturers, for example. This reference to the
printer’s resolution is a horizontal plotting value of 1440 pixels by a ver-
tical resolution of 720 pixels. Printer drivers often let you change output
resolutions at the time you print your files. Therefore, on a 1440 x 720
printer, you might be able to print 1404 x 1440 or 720 x 360. People often
use the lower value for printing drafts and text documents.
Regardless of the resolutions your printer supports, realize that your file
resolution doesn’t need to match your device resolution. Just about any
printer you use can print your photos at resolutions higher than your
image resolution.
In this chapter, we use dpi (dots per inch) rather than ppi (pixels per inch)
for the description of printers. Although the terms do represent slightly dif-
ferent measurements, they’re most often used interchangeably.
Because you have three different resolutions to work with, the question you
should consider is, “What resolutions should I use for my images to produce
high-quality prints?” The one thing you can always control is the resolution of
the file that your camera produces. You have little control over your camera’s
capture resolution, and you can’t exceed the maximum resolution produced
by the camera. (You may have an adjustment on your printer to choose from
two or more different resolutions.) However, the real control you have is with
your photo files — but only to a certain extent.

Changing image resolution
The last step you perform when printing files is setting the resolution of the
image to the target resolution recommended by your printer manufacturer.
You can find this value in the user manual for your printer. If you can’t find
any documentation on what resolution to size your images, you can use 300
ppi as a default with just about any desktop printer.
When you open the Print dialog box in Elements, you find options for scaling
images to fit your paper. Although Elements provides you with scaling options,
you always get the best results when you size your prints at a one-to-one ratio
between image size and output size. For example, if you want to print a 5-x-7-
inch image at 300 ppi, size the image to those dimensions and that resolution
before you open the Print dialog box. If you try to print an 8-x-10-inch file at 600
ppi and later scale the image by using the Elements Print dialog box, you’re
sending more data to the printer than you need. Your image prints more slowly
because the computer has to process more data. In addition, excessive resolu-
tion can actually degrade photos on most desktop printers.
To size images for output, follow these steps:
1. Open an image in Elements that you want to print.
2. Select Image➪Resize➪Image Size (or press Alt+Ctrl+I for PCs,
Option+Ô+I for Macs).
The Image Size dialog box, shown in Figure 13-1, opens.
3. Deselect the check box for Resample Image.
4. Type a new width or height in the Width or Height text boxes.
As you type a value in the Width or Height text box with the Resample
Image check box deselected, the image resolution shown in the Resolution
text box changes in proportion to the setting you add to either Width or
Height. As you type a higher number in either text box, the Resolution text
box is proportionally lowered. When you type a smaller value in Width 
or Height, the Resolution goes up. If the Resample Image check box is
selected, the resolution doesn’t change. 
When you set either the Width or Height in the Image Size dialog box,
the opposite value is proportionately sized automatically. For example, 
if you start with an 8-x-10-inch size and type 4 for the Width, the Height
drops automatically to 5. Likewise, if you type 5 for the Height, the
Width automatically drops to 4. Elements links these settings by default
to prevent distortion of your image.

Figure 13-1: In the Image Size dialog box, 
you can size images for output.
5. While still in the Image Size dialog box, select the Resample Image set-
ting again and observe the value in the Resolution text box.
Is the value sufficient to get a quality print? If you drop far below the 
recommended resolution, you’re trying to print a file larger than your
printer can handle while still outputting a quality photo. You’d need to
take another picture or scan another scan at higher resolution. For cam-
eras, this might mean moving in closer to your subject. For scanners,
you might need to boost the scan resolution.
If the Resolution setting is larger than the recommended output resolu-
tion, you’re in good luck. Just make sure the Resample Image check box
is selected and type the output resolution you want in the Resolution
text box. As you enter a value in the Resolution text box with the
Resample Image check box selected, the Width and Height values stay
fixed at the size you specify in Step 4.
6. Click OK.
If you downsized your image in these steps, you’ll see the photo in the
Image window in Elements get a bit smaller. The file is downsampled to
the resolution and size you set in the Image Size dialog box. You can
recheck your settings by opening the dialog box again. Just press Alt+
Ctrl+I (Option+Ô+I for Macs), and the Image Size dialog box opens,
showing your settings as the new default.
247
Chapter 13: Printing

Part IV: Finishing Work 
Cropping images
As we mention in the preceding section, if you set either the Width or Height
in the Image Size dialog box, the opposite value is proportionately sized auto-
matically. Elements links these settings by default to prevent distortion.
When you size photos for output, most often, one dimension isn’t sized prop-
erly for the output size. For example, if you have an 8-x-10-inch image and you
want to print a 4-x-6-inch photo, you can open the Image Size dialog box and
set the Height for 6 inches. But doing so results in the Width automatically
dropping to 4.8 inches. In order to get the size reduced to the exact dimen-
sions you want, you need to crop the image. In this example, you would need
to cut off the excess .8 inches from the width.
Follow these steps to crop a photo:
1. Open the Image Size dialog box (Alt+Ctrl+I for PCs, Option+Ô+I for
Macs) and type a value for the Width or Height. Leave the Resample
Image check box deselected.
Make sure you type a value in either the Width or Height that results in
an image size in the corresponding value that’s larger than the size you
actually want for that value. For example, if you want a 4-x-6-inch print,
be certain Width is larger than 4 or the Height is larger than 6. You need
to make one of the settings the exact size and the other larger than
needed.
2. Click OK, and the image is resized while preserving the image 
resolution.
3. Click the Crop tool.
4. In the Options bar at the top of the Elements window, type a value in
the text box for the dimension that needs cropping.
For example, if you sized an image to a 6-inch height and need to crop
off some width, type 4 in the Width text box in the Options bar, as shown
in Figure 13-2.
5. Drag the Crop tool across the full dimension of the setting you added
to the Image Size dialog box in Step 1.
In this example, we draw the Crop tool to extend from the top to the
bottom of the image to capture the full height. The width shows some
area outside the crop dimensions because that’s the data we’re cutting
off, as you can see in Figure 13-2. Note that the target crop region is rep-
resented by a dashed line in Figure 13-2.

Figure 13-2: Use the Crop tool to resize your image, cutting off a portion of the height or width.
6. Press the Enter/Return key to crop the image.
When you move the cursor inside the rectangle that you draw with the
Crop tool in Step 5, the cursor changes to an arrowhead. You can click
and drag the arrowhead cursor in the rectangle to decide what you want
to crop off. When you’re happy with the cropped image the rectangle
surrounds, press the Enter/Return key.
Click the Crop tool button

Part IV: Finishing Work 
7. Open the Image Size dialog box again (Alt+Ctrl+I for PCs, Option+Ô+I
for Macs) and take a look at the value in the Resolution text box.
Make sure you have sufficient resolution for your output and select the
Resample Image check box.
8. Type a resolution value that matches your optimized output resolu-
tion. (Use 300 ppi if you don’t know the requirements of your printing
device.) Click OK, and your file is ready to print.
You may wonder about the settings for Width, Height, and Resolution in the
Options bar. Yes, these options do exist, and you may think that you can
bypass visiting the Image Size dialog box by just typing values in the Options
bar when you use the Crop tool. In some cases, using the Options bar dimen-
sions works fine. In other cases, you can inadvertently upsize your file. For
example, if you start with an image of 4 x 5 inches and you want to crop to 
5 x 7 inches at 300 ppi, the image resolution at the 5-x-7-inch size might drop
below 300 ppi. The Options bar doesn’t tell you that. The image will be
cropped and upsized to 300 ppi without you knowing it. Using the steps in
this section is a surefire way to be certain that you’re not upsizing your
images.
Converting Color
Printing your pictures and getting the color right requires knowing how to
manage color at print time. You can choose to let Elements convert color
from your workspace (sRGB or Adobe RGB) to your output profile, or you 
can convert to a color output profile yourself and then print the file.
You might convert color to an output profile when you’re printing a proof
print on your desktop inkjet printer for a file that you want to submit to a 
service center. If you have the appropriate color profile, you might want to
print a test print (if you also have paper samples of material your commercial
vendor uses) or preview a print on your calibrated monitor before sending it
off to the service center.
We cover the actual steps for converting color to output profiles back in
Chapter 4. After you convert color and save the file with the printer profile
embedded, you go about printing the file much differently than printing files
without converted color.

Printing to Epson Inkjet Printers
Print settings vary according to manufacturers, and we can’t hope to cover
all printers in this chapter. We discuss Epson printers as an introduction to
printing to desktop color printers, but we also show some print options for
HP and Canon low-end inkjets in sections later in this chapter.
If you own a different brand of printer or use a service that uses other print-
ers, just keep the process we outline in this chapter for printing your files in
mind. Regardless of what type of printer you own, you need to know when 
to use a color profile and how color is either managed or not managed. You
may have different check box selections and menu commands, but the gen-
eral process is the same for any printer you use to print your photos.
Over the last few years, at least half of the many service-provider troubleshoot-
ing tech calls clients have made involved problems with accurate color output
from Epson and some other inkjet printers. We’re not talking about subtle
changes between monitor and printer, but huge monstrous, color changes on
output prints. As it turns out, almost all the strange output results originated
from just one minor error the users made when setting up a file to print, involv-
ing either the when or how of managing color in the Print dialog box.
The settings we discuss in this chapter can help you get accurate results
without stress or frustration. Just remember to use the settings exactly as
described. When you use the proper settings, you can achieve superior
results with either desktop or professional printers.
To help clarify and simplify the rules for the various types of profile usage,
here’s a quick summary:
 Automatic profile selection: This option is designed for novice users who
want a simple means of printing without having to decide what profile to
use. Use sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998), choose Printer Color Management
from the Profile menu, and use the color controls in the printer driver
dialog boxes. We detail this option in the following section.
 Photoshop Elements Color Conversion: You use this method when you
want to make the profile selection yourself, but you want to choose from
a list of generic profile types created for printing to a particular kind of
paper. You might have profiles you download from vendor sites created
for a line of papers, such as Kodak’s Glossy Photo Stock papers. You
have an advantage when you use this method or the following one
because you can convert the color by using the target profile and then
soft proof the image onscreen. (We cover soft proofing in Chapter 14.)
Select the profile for your specific paper in the Print dialog box and
choose Relative Colormetric for the Rendering Intent. Use the Relative
251
Chapter 13: Printing

252
Part IV: Finishing Work 
Colormetric setting as a default for all your photo images. Turn off all
color management. We detail this method in the section “Selecting a
printer profile manually,” later in this chapter.
 Converted color: Use this method when you convert color by using a
utility, such as the Dry Creek Photo Profile Converter or an AppleScript.
Select Same as Source and use No Color Management in the printer
driver. We detail this option in Chapter 4.
Using automatic profile selection
When you install your printer driver, the installation utility also installs a
number of color profiles. You can choose those profiles in Photoshop
Elements’ Print dialog box and control all the printing by using the profile
provided by your printer manufacturer.
You have a choice for how these profiles are used. You can select the profile
in the Print dialog box, or you can choose an automatic method, in which the
manufacturer created a no-nonsense process of automatic profile selection
by using your printer driver. The color profile is automatically selected when
you choose the paper source.
We want to explain the automatic method to you and let you know that it
exists, but we don’t recommend you use it for your printing. Among other
things, you really can’t tell by looking in the Print Preview dialog box what pro-
file you’re using to print your file. In addition, you don’t have a way to convert
your working-space color to the device profile for accurate soft proofing. (We
cover soft proofing in Chapter 14.) But you should understand what goes on
when the selection is made to be aware of some potential consequences.
The color engines in Photoshop Elements, ICM (Image Color Management in
Windows), Colorsync (on the Mac), and the Epson Print Driver work in a simi-
lar manner, although they all show subtle differences when used to convert a
file. For our setup instructions, we use the Epson Color Engine and work with
an unconverted file, letting the printer driver automatically select the color
profile. Our unconverted file is a photo still in its native color space, such as
sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). Assuming your file is open in Elements and you’ve
already sized your file for the target dimensions and resolution for output, the
following sections show you how to print from the native color space.
Printing in Windows
Here’s how to print from Windows:
1. Choose File➪Page Setup. In the Page Setup dialog box that appears,
select the orientation of your print (either Portrait or Landscape), as
shown in Figure 13-3.

Figure 13-3: Click the orientation matching your photo in the Page Setup dialog box.
2. Click the Printer button in the Page Setup dialog box to open a second
Page Setup dialog box.
3. From the Name menu, select your printer, as shown in Figure 13-4.

4. Click OK in the second Page Setup dialog box to return to the first
dialog box. Click OK in the first dialog box to close it, too.
5. Select File➪Print to open the Print Preview dialog box.
By default, the Color Management options are hidden in the Print dialog
box. To display choices for managing color and selecting printer pro-
files, select the Show More Options check box in the Print dialog box.
6. From the Printer Profile menu at the bottom of the dialog box, select
Printer Color Management, as shown in Figure 13-5.
This choice uses your current workspace color and will convert the
color from your workspace to the printer output file when you open the
print driver dialog box.
Figure 13-5: Select Show More Options and select Printer Color Management from the Printer
Profile menu.

7. Click the Print Preview button in the Print dialog box.
The file doesn’t print yet. Instead, the Page Setup dialog box that
appeared second in Step 2 opens again.
8. Verify that your target printer is still selected and click Properties to
open the print driver dialog box.
9. Set print attributes.
Each printer displays a different dialog box after you click Properties in
the Page Setup dialog box. Figure 13-6 shows you the Epson Stylus Photo
R320 Series Properties dialog box. Although many Epson printers use an
identical dialog box, some Epson printers, especially the high-end devices,
display different dialog boxes. Furthermore, printers from other manufac-
turers may appear with completely different settings in the print driver
dialog box.
For our Epson example, select Premium Glossy Photo Paper (or what-
ever kind of paper you’re using) from the Type menu and click the Best
Photo radio button, as shown in Figure 13-6.

10. To color manage your output, start by clicking the Advanced button.
Color managing your file is critical in your print-production workflow.
For the Epson printer, click the Advanced button, which opens a warn-
ing dialog box. Simply click Continue to open the Advanced Settings
dialog box, as you see in Figure 13-7.
Figure 13-7: Click Advanced, and then click Continue to access the 
advanced settings in the Epson print driver.
11. Make the following choices in this dialog box:
• Select a paper type under Paper & Quality Options. The second
menu in the Paper & Quality Options section of the dialog box
determines what profile the printer will use for its automatic selec-
tion. Choose the same paper here that you did back in Step 9.
• Turn color management on by clicking the Color Controls radio
button. This setting tells the print driver to automatically select a
printer profile for the paper type you select.
• From the Color Mode drop-down menu, choose Epson Standard.
Be certain to not use Epson Vivid. This choice produces inferior
results on photos.

If you frequently use the same settings to print files, you can save your
settings by clicking the Save Setting button.
12. Click OK, then click OK again in the print dialog box, and your file is
sent to your printer.
The color is converted automatically from your source workspace of
sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) to the profile that the printer driver automat-
ically selects for you.
Printing on a Macintosh
On the Macintosh, the Epson printer driver offers you some different set-
tings, although the process is quite similar to that of printing from Windows
(which we detail in the preceding section). Again, we’re going to show you
the automatic method for color conversion and let the print driver handle
the conversion.
The Elements dialog box settings are the same for the Mac as you use in
Windows. You make a choice for paper orientation and choose Printer Color
Management in the Elements Print dialog box, just like Windows users. After
you click the Print button in the Elements Print Preview dialog box, things
begin to change. Follow these steps after you identify orientation and printer
profile:
1. Click Print to open a second Print dialog box, shown in Figure 13-8.
From the menu below Presets, select Print Settings.
The choices that the menu, shown in Figure 13-8, gives you are specific
to your printer type. If you use a printer other than Epson, or even cer-
tain models of Epson, your menu choices will look different than the
choices in Figure 13-8.

2. In the Print dialog box (with Print Settings selected), select the paper
type from the Media Type menu.
3. Under Mode, click the Advanced radio button and select Best Photo
from the Print Quality menu. (See Figure 13-9.)
You may have some other options for Quality if you’re using a different
brand printer. If so, choose the best quality from the list you see in the
menu.
Figure 13-9: In the Print dialog box, you can choose settings for the best 
print quality.
4. To select the color management method, select Color Management
from the menu that shows Print Settings in Figure 13-9, as shown in
Figure 13-10.
5. Select the Color Controls radio button and select Epson Standard from
the Mode menu.
Selecting the Color Controls radio button tells the Print Driver to
manage the color.
6. Click Print, and the file prints with an automatic color conversion
from your workspace color to the printer color profile.

Figure 13-10: You can adjust the color of your print in the Color 
Management menu in the Print dialog box.
Selecting a printer profile manually
You can also manage color when printing files by selecting a printer profile
manually from the available list of color profiles that were installed with your
printer. The preceding sections use the printer to manage color (when you
select Printer Color Management); this time, let Photoshop Elements manage
the color. Again, the Windows options and Macintosh commands vary a little,
so we discuss how to print by selecting a profile for each operating system.
Printing with a printer profile in Windows
The steps for setting up the page and selecting a printer are the same as
those described in the section “Using automatic profile selection,” earlier in
this chapter. The steps change when you let Elements handle the color con-
version, and you follow these steps in the Print dialog box:
1. From the Printer Profile menu in the Print Preview dialog box, select
the color profile designed for use with the paper on which you’ve
chosen to print your image. Note: Follow Steps 1–5 in the “Using auto-
matic profile selection” section earlier in this chapter and start with
this step after selecting your page size and printer name.

In this example, we use a heavyweight matte paper color profile, as
shown in Figure 13-11. (Custom color profiles you acquire from a profil-
ing service come with recommended color-rendering intents. For the

selected in the Rendering Intent menu, as you see in Figure 13-11.)
Figure 13-11: Choose a printer profile that matches the paper you use.
2. Click Print, and the second Print dialog box opens. Click the Properties
button (refer to Figure 3-4), and you arrive at the dialog box shown in
Figure 13-7.
3. Select Best Photo from the Print Quality menu and then, from the
Media Type menu, select the recommended paper choice.
Custom color profiles come with guidelines for selecting proper paper.
4. Click the Advanced button and click Continue to arrive at the dialog
box shown in Figure 13-7.
The paper choice selection is automatically carried over from the
Properties dialog box (from Step 3).
5. Click the ICM (Image Color Management) radio button and select the
Off (No Color Adjustment) check box, as shown in Figure 13-12.
If you don’t turn color management off, you end up double-profiling your
print. For more on double profiling, see the sidebar “Problems with a
magenta shift.”
6. Click OK and click OK again in the first Print dialog box to print
your file.
Figure 13-12: Choose the ICM radio button and turn off color 
adjustment to let Elements manage the color.

Printing with a custom profile
Printing with a custom profile is very simple. Just remember that you must
use the profile with the exact same settings you used to print the test target
when the profile was created. For custom profiles, you never use color man-
agement throughout the output process.
Put another way, when you generate your test target for the profiling service
from which you may order a custom profile for your printer, the service
requires that you print the target without color conversions of any kind. 
The target has to reflect the actual colors generated by your printer, from 
a known sample file and using a known printing condition and media type,
with no modifications whatsoever. The resulting profile tells the color engine
exactly how to modify the output data to match the colors as closely as pos-
sible to your working space or a different, previously embedded color profile.
For all this to work properly, you can’t allow the printer to modify the print-
ing data in any way. Photoshop Elements has to do all the work.
If you’ve obtained a custom profile from a media supplier, you must use the
specific media and intent settings they recommend for your printer, but you
can follow all other instructions in this section.
So, if you have a custom profile ready to use, follow these steps to set it up:

Chapter 13: Printing
Problems with a magenta shift
If your photos have a strong shift toward
magenta and the people in your photos look like
they’ve been lying in the sun too long, you’re
double profiling your output. One of the most
common problems with the Epson ink sets, either
pigment or dye inks, is that a file converted for
Epson output often has a strong magenta shift. It
seems that an equal mix of all the inks produces
a green-gray color. When converted, the
magenta file bias tunes out this green balance of
an equal ink mix, which is why a double-profiled
file always has a strong magenta bias.
You can check to see if your file will print with a
magenta shift before you actually print the file.
To see the magenta bias in a converted file, con-
vert any small Elements file to an Epson output
profile, such as Premium Glossy Photo Paper, by
using the Dry Creek Photo Profile Converter
(Windows) or an AppleScript (Mac), as we dis-
cuss in Chapter 14. Open the file in Elements
and select File➪Save for Web. If a warning
dialog box opens informing you that the image
size exceeds the size that the Save for Web
command was designed for, just click Yes to
ignore the warning. Because Save for Web isn’t
profile aware, the magenta shift comes through
nicely in the Save for Web dialog box.

262
Part IV: Finishing Work 
1. Use a profile converter, which we discuss in Chapter 4, to convert
color.
In Windows, use a utility such as the Dry Creek Photo Profile Converter.
On a Mac, use an AppleScript.
If you create your own profiles for the same media, or you load profiles for
each new media order from your paper supplier, add the creation date as
part of the profile name. You can easily get confused if you have a number
of profiles that you use for the same media and you haven’t had time to
delete the old profiles. Using the date in the file name helps you always
select the right profile until you have time to delete old profiles.
2. Open the converted file in Elements and then open the Print dialog
box by selecting File➪Print.
3. In the Print dialog box, select
Same as Source for your
Printer Profile, as shown in
Figure 13-13.
4. Turn color adjustment off as
you see in Figure 13-12.
Use the same settings for print-
ing that we discuss in the earlier
section, “Printing with a printer profile in Windows” to determine
color. Be certain to turn Color Management off again, as well. (Refer
to Figure 13-12.)
Printing to HP Inkjet Printers
Regardless of the printer you use, the process for printing follows the same
logic. Unfortunately, each manufacturer uses different dialog boxes and differ-
ent menu command names that can leave you completely confused if you try
to apply one printer’s steps for printing to a different printer.
The three methods for managing color (letting the printer driver determine
color, letting Elements determine color by selecting a specific color profile,
and printing files with converted color) apply to all printers, but the dialog
boxes, buttons, and menu choices look different.
The critical steps you need to be concerned about when printing files is the
profile selection, the paper selection, and when to turn color management
off. If you own an HP printer, you probably know where to make your paper
selection and your best photo selection. The most obscure setting is likely to
be the color management choice. Rather than take you through each step for
printing to an HP low-end desktop printer, the following sections take a look
at how to manage color on your HP printer.

Printing to HP printers on a Macintosh
If there’s a way to manage color on the Mac by using one of the HP Deskjet
5400 Series of printers, we haven’t found it. HP and Windows go together like
bread and butter, but using an HP printer with a Macintosh computer leaves
a lot to be desired. Among the problems with using an HP printer on a Mac is
that you can’t turn color management off. Therefore, the only surefire method
to print to an HP printer on a Mac is to let the printer manage the color. Don’t
attempt to use a specific color profile and don’t try to convert color before
printing.
When you open the Print dialog box, select Printer Color Management and
click Print. In the HP printer driver dialog box, select the Paper Type/Quality
from the menu below Presets and choose your paper type. Use only HP
papers and make a selection for the HP paper type you use, as shown in
Figure 13-15.
Figure 13-15: Select an HP paper in the Paper Type/Quality menu.
Because the printer driver determines the options in the Mac OS X Print
dialog box, you don’t have an option for color management like you do when
you use a printer such as an Epson. With the HP printer driver, you don’t get
any color management options.

Printing to Canon Printers
When printing to a Canon printer, follow the same logic we talk about for Epson
and HP printers earlier in this chapter and choose to either enable or disable
color management. With Canon color printers, the area in the print driver
dialog box is even more hidden than in Epson and HP desktop printers.
Printing to Canon printers in Windows
Control color management in one of these three ways:
 Let your printer determine color. Select Printer Color Management in
the Print dialog box (click Properties in the Print dialog box) and select
the Manual radio button under Color/Intensity in the Main tab, as shown
in Figure 13-16.
Click the Set button (in the Color Intensity area) to open the Manual
Color Adjustment dialog box. Check the box for Enable ICM (Windows
Image Color Management), as shown in Figure 13-17.
Figure 13-16: Click the Manual radio button for Color/Intensity to select the color management
settings.

 Let Elements determine color. Follow the same steps as in the preced-
ing bullet, but uncheck the Enable ICM (Windows Image Color
Management) check box.
 Print a file with converted color. Select Same as Source in the Print
dialog box and uncheck Enable ICM (Windows Image Color
Management).
Figure 13-17: Check Enable ICM (Windows Image Color Management) 
to leave the color up to your printer.
Printing to Canon Printers on a Mac
You make the same choices on a Mac as you do in Windows for how you want
to manage color on a Canon printer. If you want to let the printer manage 
the color, click Print in Elements and select Quality & Media from the menu
below the Presets menu. The Quality & Media dialog box appears, as shown
in Figure 13-18. Make a paper choice in the Media Type menu.
From the menu below the Presets menu, select Color Options, and then from
the Color Correction menu choose BJ Standard when you want to let Elements
determine color, None when you want to select a printer profile in the
Elements Print dialog box, or Same as Source when printing a file with con-
verted color. You can see the options in Figure 13-19.

Renaming Color Profiles
If you download a custom color profile or create one by using a color calibra-
tion system, you have to leave the profile name the same as the download 
or file you created. Changing the name of a color profile on your desktop 
nullifies the profile, and it doesn’t appear in your list of profiles in the Print
dialog box.
Mac users have an advantage because they have an easy way to rename a
color profile that keeps the profile working properly and appearing in the
Print dialog box. To rename a profile on the Mac, follow these steps:
1. Open the folder in which you store your profiles and click the profile
name once so the name becomes highlighted.
2. Type a new name for your profile.
You can find an AppleScript
called Rename profile in your
Scripts folder (Macintosh 
HD/Library/ColorSync/
Scripts).
3. Drag your renamed profile to
the Rename profile script.
The dialog box shown in Figure
13-20 opens.
4. Click the Filename button, and the dialog box closes.
Your profile now works properly with the new profile name.
If you don’t run the AppleScript after renaming the file, the computer renders
the file unusable.
Printing Contact Prints
A good way to proof files while conserving consumable materials is to print
contact sheets. You can select a number of images in the Organizer and print
the selected images on one or more sheets. When you print contact sheets,
view your files in the Organizer, where you can easily select multiple files.
For contact sheet printing, don’t bother to size your files in one of the editing
modes. Contact sheet printing is the exception to the rule of sizing images for
print. You can choose files of any size and let Elements size the files at print
time. Sizing all the photos to small thumbnails and saving duplicate copies is
much more time consuming than having Elements do the work for you.
Figure 13-20: To make your profile name
change official, click Filename.

To print a contact sheet, follow these steps:
1. Open the Organizer by clicking the Organize button in the Shortcuts
Bar in either editing mode.
Or you can open the Organizer when you first launch Elements and click
the View and Organize Photos button in the Welcome screen.
You should have already edited the files you select for printing for
brightness and color corrections.
2. Select the photos you want to print.
Hold down the Ctrl key (the Ô key on Macs) and click the photos you
want to add to your selection.
3. From the Organizer window, select File➪Print.
The Print dialog box opens.
4. Select Contact Sheet from the Select Type of Print menu. (See Fig-
ure 13-21.)
Below the menu, you can see an option for the layout.
5. Type the number of columns you want in the Columns text box.
Elements automatically calculates the rows for you based on the
number of columns you choose. As you increase the number of columns,
you can print more images on a single sheet, but the images are smaller.
If you’re printing to check color, don’t make the prints too small. About
four columns is the most you can put on your contact sheet to see sizes
large enough to examine color.
6. Select the boxes to add Date, Caption, and Filename text labels to
your contact sheet.
Selecting Filename makes filenames appear on the contact sheet, so you
can more easily reference the files.
7. Click the More Options button to access the More Options dialog box,
shown in Figure 13-22.
You select the profile in this dialog box when printing contact sheets.
8. From the Print Space menu, select the profile you want to use.
Follow the guidelines outlined throughout this chapter.
9. Click OK in the More Options dialog box and then click Print in the
Print dialog box.
Your printer driver dialog box opens, in which you can make choices for
color management. Use the options for printing that relate to your printer
profile choice. (We cover printer profile choices earlier in this chapter.)

Choosing Paper and Inks
Photographers have always been concerned with the archival quality of
prints when printing to inkjet printers. In the early days of the inkjet printers,
you were lucky to get a lifespan of six months before your prints started to
fade — a condition not acceptable to any photographer. As inkjet manufac-
turers improved their research and development, the inks have greatly
improved, too.
Many inkjet printers support one of two kinds of inks:
 Dye-based inks: Dye inks were the first to appear for inkjet printers. The
original inks had very poor archival qualities, but they printed more bril-
liant colors than the pigmented inks. Today, dye-based inks have much
better archival qualities, and they still print more brilliant colors than
the pigmented inks. But the gap is rapidly narrowing.
 Pigmented inks: Pigmented inks stay usable much longer than the dye-
based inks (manufacturers claim pigmented inks have more than 100
years of life). When pigmented inks were first introduced, they tended to
clog the heads on inkjet printers, and the colors weren’t close to what
the dye inks could offer in terms of saturation and brilliance. Newer pig-
mented inks flow easily through the heads on inkjet printers, and the
color saturation has been greatly improved.
With the proliferation of so many different inkjet printers for consumers and
pros, the printer manufacturers and paper suppliers developed an incredible
array of different products. Most common are the photo-quality papers that
appear similar to photo papers that photo finishing labs use. In addition to a
variety of different coated stock photo-quality papers, you can find specialized
material, such as Mylar, canvas, watercolor, LexJet, adhesive, matte, translu-
cent, and so on. The list is long, and you have an abundance of choices.
Ideally, you should have a color profile for each paper you use. Papers have,
among other things, different absorption responses that affect the color satu-
ration. Be certain to make the paper selection that the paper or printer manu-
facturer recommends when you print to any paper. And be prepared to run
many tests.

Soft Proofing Color
In This Chapter
 Using soft-proof files in Elements
 Converting to an output profile in Windows or on a Mac
 Soft proofing a converted image
S
oft proofing is a way of examining a file on your monitor before you print
it. Creating soft proofs can save you materials and supplies. If your moni-
tor is well calibrated and shows an accurate rendition of a printed piece, you
can view files in the color space of your printer and, with a reasonable degree
of accuracy, determine if your photos will print with the proper color.
In this chapter, we talk about soft proofing as a way to hopefully save 
you a bunch of money on paper and ink purchases for your desktop color
printers.
Understanding Soft Proofing
What is soft proofing? Soft proofing means generating
an exact monitor view of your printer output before
you actually send it to the printer. If you go to the
trouble of obtaining custom profiles for your printer
or want to see the exact result of using your printer’s
driver profiles, soft proofing provides a preview of
your printed output. (If you’re unfamiliar with pro-
files, flip to Chapter 4, where we introduce how output
profiles work and how to get custom or developer-
created profiles.)
Note: Some of the newest Epson desktop printers don’t allow you
to access the profiles shipped by Epson, so you’re out of luck unless you’re
trying to soft proof a custom profile.

274
Part IV: Finishing Work 
Soft proofing is especially important if your file contains a lot of highly satu-
rated color because hue errors are most common as you reach the limits of
your printer’s color gamut. (For an explanation of color gamuts, see Chapter 1.)
Best of all, soft proofing saves money! You can catch printer output problems
before wasting expensive paper and ink. Of course, accurate soft proofing
depends on having a well-calibrated monitor. (We explain how to calibrate
your monitor in Chapter 3.)
Converting to an Output Profile
Soft proofing is one of the best features of a color-management workflow.
Unfortunately, Adobe didn’t include this very important feature in Elements 5.
At the present time, you need Adobe Photoshop to get this feature as a menu
command.
To soft proof with Elements, you need to use a workaround. Elements has the
same accurate monitor compensation that Adobe Photoshop does. If you
open a file with an embedded printer output profile, the monitor compensa-
tion kicks in and shows you a very accurate soft proof view.
To make this work, you must convert the file to the printer output profile 
outside of Elements and then open the file in Elements, which essentially pro-
vides you with the soft-proof file. You need to convert color to your printer
color, and with a well-calibrated monitor, what you see on-screen after con-
verting to the printer color is what you’ll get when you ultimately print the
file. The conversion process in Windows is different from that on a Mac, and
you can find steps for each operating system in the sections that follow.
The file you convert will be permanently altered. To keep your master file
intact, create a duplicate of your file. If you like the look of the soft proof, you
can save the duplicate as your printing file.
You may want to convert color not only for soft proofing a profile, but also to
get a file ready for printing to your home printer or at a printing service. If
you’re soft proofing to check colors before sending your file or files to a print-
ing service, by following the steps in one of the following sections, you then
have the color converted when you’re ready to actually print. Chapter 13
covers printing in detail.
Converting color in Windows
In Windows, you can download a free utility from Dry Creek Photo that will
convert color from a workspace profile to a color profile. As an example,
assume you want to print some pictures at a discount store, such as Costco,

and you want to check how that store’s profiles will impact your color and be
certain you use the correct profile for the photo equipment that prints your
pictures. You want to convert color from your color workspace (in this exam-
ple, sRGB works best) to the profile for a photo printer and paper you want
to use.
Before get starting with the conversion, download the utility by going to www.
drycreekphoto.com/tools/profile_converter and clicking the link for
ProfileConverterSetup.zip. After downloading the file to your hard drive,
double-click the Setup file and follow the brief steps in the install wizard.
The Dry Creek Photo Web site (www.drycreekphoto.com) is one of the best
sources of information available for color management and color profiling. In
addition to offering custom color-profiling services, Dry Creek Photo hosts a
number of different color profiles for many different commercial printers.
When you finish installing the Dry Creek Photo converter, follow these steps
to prepare a file for soft proofing before sending it to a photo service, such as
Costco:
1. Make all the necessary edits you need to make in Elements and save
your files in TIFF format.
You must use TIFF format to use the converter.
2. Download color profiles from your photo service’s Web site.
Almost all service centers post color profiles for their printing equip-
ment. You can visit the Costco Web site at www.costco.com, click the
Services link on the home page, and click Photo Center on the next page.
You’re prompted to set up an account, and then you come to a page on
which profiles are listed. Costco makes the profiles available for stores
in their geographic regions, and you usually find profiles for printing on
their equipment and profiles best suited for different papers. This is
something you need to pay attention to. If several profiles are available
for downloading, be certain to use the right profile for the paper you
want your pictures to be printed on.
If you use a photo lab that wants you to convert color and embed pro-
files, you can visit that lab’s Web site and download profiles, as well.
3. Copy the profiles to your system color folder: C:\WINDOWS\
system32\spool\drivers\color.
This is the folder in which all your color profiles are stored.
4. Choose Start➪Programs➪Dry Creek Photo➪Profile Converter➪ICC
Profile Converter.
The ICC Profile Converter dialog box opens, as you can see in Figure 14-1.
275
Chapter 14: Soft Proofing Color

276
Part IV: Finishing Work 
Figure 14-1: You can select the options for converting a color profile 
in the Dry Creek Photo ICC Profile Converter dialog box.
5. Click the Source Image ellipsis ( . . . ) and select the source file.
The source file is the file you saved in TIFF format that you want to print.
6. Click the Source Color Profile ellipsis and select the source color 
profile.
This is the color profile that’s currently embedded in your source file.
7. Click the Destination Image ellipsis and select the folder in which you
want to save your file.
8. Click the Destination Color Profile ellipsis and select the color profile
that your photo service’s equipment uses.
You saved your color profiles to the Windows color folder, so be certain
to look in this folder for the target printer color profiles.
9. If you want to process multiple files, check the box for Process
Multiple Files.
10. Be certain to check the box for Embed Profile in Image and then click
the Convert button after you select all the options you want.
After you click Convert, the profile converter handles the profile conver-
sion and saves your files to the target folder. See the section “Viewing
the Soft Proof,” later in this chapter, for details on proofing the color.
Although you need to convert your file to a TIFF to use the Dry Creek Photo
utility, many consumer printing labs require you to send files in JPEG format.
You can convert your file from one format to another and still keep the profile
embedded in the image. We discuss working with profiles and file formats,
including how to convert a file from one format to another, in Chapter 4.

Converting profiles by using operating 
system tools on a Macintosh
For Mac users, you don’t have to look far when you want to convert color
spaces in your photos. Mac OS X has a number of AppleScripts that few people
know about. You can convert profiles for images just like Windows users who
work with the Dry Creek Photo utility. On the Mac, follow these steps when you
want to prepare files for a service, such as the Costco photo center:
1. Make all the edits you need to make in Elements and save your files in
the format that your service center needs.
In many cases, service centers use JPEG files. If you intend to print your
pictures to your own desktop printer, use the TIFF format. Also, be cer-
tain to use sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) as your workspace and save your
files with the workspace embedded in the images (see Chapter 4 for how
to save your photos while embedding a workspace profile).
2. Open the AppleScripts ColorSync folder (which you can find by 
clicking through the following folders: Macintosh HD/Library/
ColorSync/Scripts).
AppleScripts are mini programs installed with your operating system 
and custom scripts you can create with the AppleScript Editor (which 
is also installed with your operating system installation). On Mac OS X, 
a number of short scripts are installed that allow you to convert color
spaces in files saved in the JPEG or TIFF format. To find the scripts 
used for converting color profiles, open Macintosh HD/Library/
ColorSync/Scripts.
3. Locate the script to convert the color in your photo(s).
Open the ColorSync folder and identify the scripts used for converting
and embedding color output profiles. You have two choices, as shown in
Figure 14-2. You can use either the Embed Chosen Profile or Match to
Chosen Profiles script.
If you have your files saved with the same color workspace profile, such
as sRGB, and you want to convert the color to a specific output profile,
use the Embed Chosen Profile script. If you want to identify a source pro-
file (such as another profile that might have been saved with your file)
and convert to an output profile, use the Match to Chosen Profiles script.
If one script produces an error while it’s attempting the conversion, use
the other script.
4. Drag a file (or files) to the script icon.
If you want to convert multiple files, select them from a folder in which
you saved your files and drag the files on top of the script icon. You can
process many files at the same time by dragging a selected group to the
script icon. In this example, we use the Embed Chosen Profile script.
277
Chapter 14: Soft Proofing Color

278
Part IV: Finishing Work 
Figure 14-2: Locate either the Embed Chosen Profile or Match to Chosen Profiles icon.
5. Convert to an output profile.
The script makes it easy to iden-
tify the source and destination
profile. If you use the Match to
Chosen Profiles script, you need
to identify a source profile when
a dialog box prompts you. If you
use the Embed Chosen Profile
script, you’re prompted to iden-
tify only your output profile.
Assuming you saved all your images that embed either the sRGB or Adobe
RGB (1998) color profile, drag the files to the Embed Chosen Profile icon,
and the dialog box in Figure 14-3 opens.
6. Click OK in the dialog box shown in Figure14-3.
The Choose a File dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 14-4. The
AppleScript automatically opens the folder in which your color profiles
are stored.
Figure 14-3: You’re first prompted to confirm
your profile conversion.

Figure 14-4: Select the output color profile that you want to use from the Profile menu.
7. From the Profile menu, select the profile you want to use and click the
Choose button.
That’s it! Your file is converted to your chosen output profile.
Viewing the Soft Proof
After you convert the color to an output color profile (which we talk about in
the preceding sections), it’s time to soft proof your image. Follow these steps
to soft proof your image:
1. In Elements, select Edit➪Color Settings.
The Color Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 14-5, opens.
2. Click the radio button for Always Optimize Colors for Computer
Screens and then click OK.
3. Open the file that you converted to an output color profile.
What you see on-screen is what your printer will produce — simple as
that, assuming you converted the file to the correct color profile.
279
Chapter 14: Soft Proofing Color

280
Part IV: Finishing Work 
Figure 14-5: Set the Color Settings to Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens.
4. Check the color profile in the image.
At the bottom of the image window, click the right-pointing arrow to
open a menu, as shown in Figure 14-6. Select Document Profile from the
menu options. The current color profile appears to the left of the right-
pointing arrow. Verify that the file you’re soft proofing contains the
printer profile you intend to use for your printer and paper.
Be aware that soft proofing by using one of the profiles you received with
your printer isn’t always accurate because of manufacturing variations. 
Give the soft proof a try and see if the printer-provided profile is accurate.
Sometimes, it is. In other cases, the color match isn’t very close at all.
The profiles shipped with your printer are generic in nature. They’re a kind 
of average for your printer, but they’re not specific to your printer the way a
custom-made profile is. A well-made custom profile gives you a soft-proof
view that matches your print output very closely.
If you want to print the converted file that you just soft proofed, be sure to
use the Same as Source setting and no color adjustment in the Elements Print
dialog box, as we describe in Chapter 13.

Figure 14-6: Check your file’s printer profile with the menu in the Image Window.
The lack of a soft proof feature in Elements 5 is the main reason we recommend
using sRGB as your color workspace. The color gamut (or range of colors) in
the sRGB space is much closer to most inkjet and photo paper gamuts than is
Adobe RGB. For this reason, your monitor view will tend to be the most accu-
rate without a soft-proof option.

C
orrecting tonal balance and color in your pictures is always an easier
job if you start off on the right foot. To make your tonal and
color adjustments easier, you need to keep a few things in
mind before you start shooting pictures. A little planning
goes a long way in getting your pictures edited for the
proper color balance.
Calibrating Your Monitor
We can’t stress the importance of calibrating your
monitor enough. You paid a fairly low price for
Photoshop Elements — or you might have obtained a
copy free with your digital camera. A very low-cost cali-
bration device is an essential purchase if you intend to
color correct any kind of photo. For the best deals, visit
online resellers and pick up either the Pantone Huey or the
ColorVision Spyder2express calibration device for as low as $69 U.S.
Set up your computer monitor before you engage in any kind of color editing
and run a lot of test prints to be sure that your output matches your monitor
view. You can find details about how to calibrate your monitor in Chapter 3.

286
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Using a Gray Card
Gray cards are sold at photo suppliers and used by professional photogra-
phers. These cards help you identify neutral grays when making tone and
color adjustments. You can purchase a booklet of several gray cards, like the
QPcard sold at www.calumetphoto.com, for a low cost. Keep the booklet of
cards in your camera bag and use them when shooting your pictures. Follow
these steps when shooting pictures, especially portraits:
1. Set up your lighting for the photo shoot.
2. Have your subject hold a QPcard, as shown in Figure 15-1.
3. Shoot a second shot using the exact same lighting conditions of the
subject without the QPcard.
Figure 15-1: Shoot a photo with a subject holding a QPcard.

4. When you open your photos in Elements, open both images. Use the
Levels midtone sampler to sample middle gray in the photo with the
QPcard while working on the photo without the card. 
This method insures you of always having a neutral gray to sample when
adjusting for brightness using Levels. In Chapter 10, you can find details
about working with the Levels midtone sampler.
Or Using the GretagMacbeth ColorChecker
A more expensive solution for adding a prop to your photos for finding neu-
tral grays is the GretagMacbeth ColorChecker. It costs more at about $69 U.S.,
but this card offers you not only neutral gray in a color swatch but a spec-
trum of colors that you can view to check the color on your monitor. You can
find the card at online resellers such as www.calumetphoto.com. Like the
method with the QPcard, shoot a scene with the GretagMacbeth ColorChecker
and then shoot another scene without the color checker. You can use the
middle gray swatch for sampling midtone grays as well as a number of other
colors in the chart shown in Figure 15-2.
Figure 15-2: Shoot a photo with the GretagMacbeth ColorChecker.
Shooting Pictures in Proper Lighting
Shooting pictures in well-balanced lighting for normal exposures makes your
editing job in Elements much easier. Try to avoid harsh background lighting
287
Chapter 15: Ten Tips for Better Tone and Color

288
Part V: The Part of Tens 
whenever possible. When shooting portraits or people shots against harsh
backgrounds, follow these steps:
1. Move in close to your subject and take a light reading of the subject’s
hand, arm, or face.
2. Note the exposure reading and set the same reading to a manual 
exposure.
3. Move back and take your picture, ignoring all the background lighting.
4. When you edit your photo in Elements, adjust tone and color for the
foreground subject.
The background light might be overexposed, but your subject should be
properly exposed, making the skin-tone corrections in Elements much easier.
See Chapter 9 for the details about correcting skin tones.
Shooting Photos against a Background
Outdoor lighting can be a blessing or a curse. If you shoot outdoor portraits
and you’re not concerned about background areas, take a black cloth and a
white cloth in your camera bag. Have someone assist you by holding the
cloth behind a subject when you take a portrait photo. You’ll find isolating
the subject much easier, as well as making tonal and color corrections an
easy editing job.
Using Curves Adjustment Layers
We uploaded two Curves adjustment layers to the Wiley companion Web 
site. (See the Introduction for details about the Web site.) Curves adjustment
layers are found on the companion Web site, and you can use the layers pro-
vided for increasing and decreasing contrast.
If you want a little more contrast and brightness control, solicit a little help
from a Photoshop user. You can request Curves settings to
 Darken a photo and increase contrast.
 Darken a photo and decrease contrast.
 Lighten a photo and increase contrast.
 Lighten a photo and decrease contrast.

Here’s how to go about it:
1. Ask a friend who is an accomplished Photoshop user to help you out.
2. Request the friend to create the four Curves adjustment layers on four
separate low-resolution files.
These are basic S curves that accomplished Photoshop users know how
to create.
3. Open a photo in Elements needing one curve adjustment or another
and open the respective file with the Curves adjustment layer.
4. Drag the adjustment layer to your photo.
5. Use the Opacity slider to increase or decrease the amount of Curves
adjustment you want to apply to your image.
For more information about using Curves layers, see Chapter 7.
Shooting in Camera Raw
Not all cameras are capable of shooting camera raw files. When you have the
resources, purchase a camera that is capable of shooting in camera raw if
your current camera does not support the format.
When shooting your pictures, set the camera to capture both JPEG and
camera raw. Don’t worry about memory use — media cards are cheap. 
You’ll have a duplicate photo for all your shots. When you need to do some
serious editing for tone and color corrections, open the raw files in the raw
converter.
Editing 16-Bit Images
If shooting camera raw or scanning photos, keep your photos in 16-bit mode
and make all your tone and color adjustments.
In Photoshop Elements, some tools under the Enhance menu are not capable
of editing 16-bit images. Ignore these options and use the tools that permit
you to edit in 16-bit mode. After editing and sharpening images, reduce the
bit level to 8-bit just before printing.
289
Chapter 15: Ten Tips for Better Tone and Color

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Editing for Content
Not all the content of a photo will always be important to you. You might
have areas of a photo that appear overexposed or underexposed that don’t
detract from the main subject area. This is especially true with photos having
overexposed backgrounds. You can target just the important content areas
for your tone and color adjustments and reduce the distracting portions of
the photo with some simple edits. Try following these steps when you have
photos with uneven lighting:
1. Determine the important part of the photo.
If you have a subject in the foreground that’s the most important part of
the image, focus your edits on that portion of the image.
2. In Photoshop Elements, open the Levels dialog box and press the Alt/
Option key as you drag the black-and-white sliders to adjust the tones.
Disregard the distracting portion of the image and look for the first
appearance of black and white only in the content you’re interested in to
set the black-and-white points for the important content.
3. Correct color for skin tones or other matter using the Hue/Saturation
and Levels tools.
Don’t worry about the distracting background colors. Just focus on your
important subject matter. Chapter 9 covers correcting skin tones in
more detail.
4. Create a selection on the background.
It might be easier to first create a selection on the foreground, and then
inverse the selection for the background.
5. Add a slight blur (Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur) to the background to
diffuse it.
The foreground subject appears more prominent in the photo.
Using Filters
Some cameras have lighting controls that help you balance lighting for differ-
ent white balances, such as fluorescent lighting. Some cameras don’t have
the settings needed to make the proper adjustments for accurate white points.
If you have problems balancing lighting, you can purchase a filter to correct
white balance. For an inexpensive solution, follow these steps:

1. Visit an online photo supplier and look over the filter options they
offer you. Find the filter you need to control the white balance for
your photo shoots.
A number of filters are sold as gels that you can cut and tape over your
camera lens. These are much less expensive than glass filters you screw
onto the lens.
2. Cut a piece of the gel and tape it over your flash, as shown in Fig-
ure 15-3 — or when shooting outdoors, tape the gel over your lens.
Figure 15-3: A gel taped over a flash to correct for white balance.
3. Make several test shoots at different exposures to determine exposure
compensation.
4. Open the photos in Elements.
5. Record the exposure settings that produce the best results and use
these when shooting in similar lighting conditions.

f you’re a serious amateur or professional photographer, you should
consider upgrading to Adobe Photoshop. Photoshop does
have some additional tools to help you manage color and
make color correction much easier and more precise. In
this book, we push Photoshop Elements beyond its pur-
pose by creating workarounds and tasks the program
wasn’t designed to do, just to help you develop some
professional methods for color and tone corrections.
With Photoshop, you work with a program that was
designed to be a professional color correction tool
and therefore doesn’t require you to create
workarounds.
We offer only a preview of what Photoshop can do in
this book. For details about working with Photoshop’s
advanced tools, check out Photoshop CS2 All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier (Wiley).
Using the Curves Dialog Box
Photoshop Elements 5 has a new feature for using Curves; however, the
Curves commands in Elements are a very simplified version of the Curves

294
Part V: The Part of Tens 
tools that appear in Photoshop. In Elements, you’re limited to preset Curves
adjustments for controlling brightness and contrast. In Photoshop, you have
the control that changes tone levels along the 256 distinct grays in an image,
in all three channels.
Having the control over the tone
points in your images lets you fine-
tune adjustments for lightening and
darkening an image and adding or
reducing image contrast. There’s
really no substitute for Curves
adjustments when you’re color cor-
recting images and adjusting tone
levels for brightness and contrast
adjustments.
You can open Curves by selecting
Image➪Adjustments➪Curves or
create an adjustment layer in
Photoshop and select a Curves
adjustment layer. When the Curves
dialog box opens, you see the
options shown in Figure 16-1.
From the Channel drop-down menu, you can select the RGB channels, as well
as the composite RGB channel. Click the curve line to plot points and move
those points up, down, left, and right to make tonal adjustments.
Generally, Curves settings are con-
fusing to the most advanced user,
but you can easily understand
Curves with a little study. You use six
primary Curve shapes to make some
brightness and contrast adjustments.
The six basic shapes include
 Darken: Note the gradient along
the left side of the dialog box
where white appears at the top.
To darken an image, click the
center of the diagonal line and
move the point toward the black
end of the gradient (down). This
move darkens the overall image.
(See Figure 16-2.)
Figure 16-1: The Curves dialog box in Adobe
Photoshop.
Figure 16-2: Move the center point toward the
black end of the gradient to darken the photo.

 Lighten: To lighten an image, plot a point at the center of the diagonal
line and move the point toward white (in the opposite direction you
move the point to darken the image). See Figure 16-3.
 Darken with more contrast: To add more image contrast while darken-
ing a photo, first click to plot a point in the top-right corner to anchor
the curve. Then plot a point in the lower-left corner and move that point
as shown in Figure 16-4.
Figure 16-3: Move the center point toward the 
white end of the gradient to lighten the photo.
Figure 16-4: This curve darkens a photo while 
adding more contrast.
295
Chapter 16: Ten Reasons to Upgrade to Photoshop

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 Lighten with more contrast: Plot a point in the lower-left corner and
move the top-right point left to lighten the photo while adding more
contrast, as shown in Figure 16-5.
 Darken with less contrast: Plot a point in the lower-left corner and move
a point in the top-right corner down to darken the photo while reducing
contrast, as shown in Figure 16-6.
 Lighten with less contrast: The last basic curve adjustment uses a point
plotted in the top-right corner, and the lower-left point is moved up, as
shown in Figure 16-7, to lighten the photo while reducing contrast.
Figure 16-5: This curve lightens a photo while 
adding more contrast.
Figure 16-6: This curve darkens a photo while 
reducing contrast.

You have more options available when you create Curves adjustment layers.
You can adjust opacity and choose from different blending modes to further
control darkening and lightening photos while adding or reducing contrast.
Figure 16-7: This curve lightens a photo while 
reducing contrast.
Using the Channels Dialog Box
Elements lets you make Levels adjustments in either the composite RGB
channel or one of the three individual RGB channels. Unfortunately, Elements
doesn’t let you see the separate RGB channels, and you can’t apply any other
type of edit to channel data. In Photoshop, you have a separate Channels
palette, where you can
 Apply Curve settings.
 Edit channel data.
 Create gradients and load selections to tweak color and brightness in
selected areas of your image, using channels for selections.
In addition to the RGB composite channel, Photoshop permits you to create
new channels (called Alpha Channels). In these new channels, you can create
channel masks and add gradients to help you create precise selections for
targeting the areas of your photos you want to edit.
In Figure 16-8, an Alpha Channel has been added to an RGB color image and
painted with a gradient. When you choose Select➪Load Selection, the selec-
tion is loaded as a gradient selection where you can apply image contrast,
brightness, and color correction to the selected area.

298
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 16-8: In Photoshop, a Channels palette enables you to edit separate channels and create new
channels.
Changing Bit Depth
In Photoshop Elements, you have a single bit-depth conversion option. 
You can take 16-bits/channel photos opened in camera raw and convert 
the photo to an 8-bits/channel image by selecting Image➪Mode➪8-bits/
channel. Elements, however, doesn’t let you convert an 8-bit image to a 
16-bit image.
In Photoshop, you can convert 8-bit images to 16-bit images, which enables
you to make contrast and brightness adjustments in 16-bit mode. Editing in
16-bit mode helps you prevent data loss and is most often the preferred
choice when it comes to brightness and contrast adjustments. (See Chap-
ter 12 for more on 16-bit images and why they are preferred.)

If you have a point-and-shoot camera that takes only JPEG images, the
camera always saves your images as 8-bit files. In Photoshop, you can con-
vert the 8-bit images to 16-bit and then perform all your brightness and con-
trast edits while in 16-bit mode.
To convert an 8-bit image to 16-bit in Photoshop, follow these steps:
1. Open an 8-bit image in Photoshop.
2. Select Image➪Mode➪16-bits/Channel.
This command converts the image to 16-bits per channel. But you still
need to perform more steps to make your photo a true 16-bit image.
3. Select Image➪Image Size to open the Image Size dialog box.
4. Set the unit of measure to Percent from the Width or Height drop-
down menu and type 50 in either the Width or Height text box. Be 
sure that Resample Image is selected, as shown in Figure 16-9, and 
click OK.
Figure 16-9: Reduce the image 71 percent and select 
Resample Image.
This step downsamples the photo 71 percent, which reduces the image
size by 50 percent.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
The end result of your edits is a 16-bit file that you can adjust for bright-
ness and contrast with much less data loss than you’d experience with 8-bit
files.
Improving Dynamic Range
The dynamic range of your camera sensor is fixed to capture highlight,
shadow, and midtone ranges within defined limits. When light levels fall
below or above the dynamic range of your camera sensor, you lose detail 
in shadows and highlights.
One way to expand the dynamic range of a photo is to use a nifty feature in
Photoshop called Merge to HDR. This command enables you to merge several
photos taken with different exposures into a composite image that actually
produces increased dynamic range. For example, you might use three differ-
ent exposures of the same image like this:
 Overexpose one photo to capture more detail in shadows.
 Take a second image and intentionally underexpose it to capture as
much detail as you can get in the highlights.
 Average a third exposure to obtain all the midtone ranges.
After exposing three or more photos of the same scene, select File➪
Automate➪Merge to HDR. In a dialog box, select your three files with differ-
ent exposures and merge them into a single photo. You end up with an image
that’s almost impossible to capture by using a film camera. In Figure 16-10,
we changed exposure five times and shot five individual photos. We used 
the Merge to HDR command to merge the photos, producing the large com-
posite image.
Working with More Color Modes
Photoshop Elements provides you with a limited set of conversion options 
to convert your photos from one color to another. In Photoshop, you have
more options. The most important options for serious amateur or profes-
sional work are CMYK color and Lab color.
CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK) are process colors used in offset
printing. Before you can print your RGB files on an offset press at a print
shop, you need to convert the color from RGB to CMYK.

Figure 16-10: The Merge to HDR command enables you to combine photos with different exposures into a
single image.
Photoshop Elements doesn’t support CMYK color, but Photoshop does. You
can import RGB images in professional layout programs, such as Adobe
InDesign, and convert the color at print time from RGB to CMYK. However, if
you need to preview color in CMYK to observe any potential color shifts or
printing problems, you need Photoshop.
Lab color mode, like RGB color, uses three channels that store your color and
brightness values. With Lab color, you have the L, a, and b channels. The a
and b channels describe the color information. Half the color spectrum is
1 second@F-22
1/4 second@F-22
1/15th second@F-22 1/60th second@F-22 1/250th second@F-22
301
Chapter 16: Ten Reasons to Upgrade to Photoshop

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
contained in the a channel and half in the b channel. The L channel contains
only image brightness values.
Lab color can help you when you’re making brightness corrections to images
and converting files from color to grayscale. You can make all your edits and
conversions without disturbing the color in your image. When you select
Image➪Mode➪Lab color and click the L channel in the Channels palette, the
image appears, as shown in Figure 16-11. You can adjust Curves and Levels,
and perform a mode conversion while the L channel is selected. Your edits
are then applied only to the brightness values without changing the color
information.
Figure 16-11: Applying edits to the Lightness (L) channel in a Lab color image affects 
brightness values without disturbing color.

Converting to a Profile
With Photoshop Elements, you need to use a conversion utility to convert
color from your workspace to an output profile. In Windows, you might 
use a utility such as the Dry Creek Color Profile Converter that we discuss 
in Chapter 4. On a Mac, you might use an AppleScript, also discussed in
Chapter 4. In Photoshop, you don’t need to exit the program and use an
external color profile converter. Here’s how it works:
1. From the Photoshop Edit menu, select Convert to Profile.
The Convert to Profile dialog box opens, as you can see in 
Figure 16-12.
Figure 16-12: Select a printer profile in Photoshop’s Convert to Profile 
dialog box to convert the color.
2. From the Profile drop-down menu, select the profile you want to 
use for your output source, and click OK.
The color is converted from your working space to your printer 
profile.
3. You can then save the file that has the color conversion and send 
the photo to an imaging center where converted files can be down-
loaded directly to printing devices.
303
Chapter 16: Ten Reasons to Upgrade to Photoshop

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Proofing Color
In Photoshop, you can proof color on your monitor without converting the
color. A menu command exists specifically for showing you what your image
will look like when converted to an output profile without actually converting
the color. This command can be helpful if you have several output profiles for
several devices and want to preview a color conversion without changing
your file.
In Photoshop, select View➪Proof Setup➪Custom. The Customize Proof
Condition dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 16-13. From the Device to
Simulate drop-down menu, select the color profile you want to proof. Clicking
OK in the dialog box doesn’t change your image.
Figure 16-13: Open the Customize Proof Condition dialog box and 
select a profile to proof color on your monitor.
Embedding Profiles
If you decide to convert your color to an output color profile, you can easily
embed the profile in Photoshop. As we explain in Chapter 4, Photoshop
Elements affords you only two options for profile embedding — either sRGB
or Adobe RGB (1998). In Photoshop, you can embed in the photo any profile
you use to convert your color.
After you convert your color, simply select File➪Save As. In the Save As
dialog box, your current color profile automatically appears in the ICC Profile
section of the dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-14. Click Save to embed the
profile in the document.

Figure 16-14: Saving the file with the ICC Profile checkbox selected 
embeds the profile in the image.
More Options for Using Camera Raw
Photoshop provides you with many more options when converting camera
raw than does Photoshop Elements. Among the additional camera raw 
conversion options, you can find choices for selecting color space, variable
file sizes, a crop and straighten tool, ability to open multiple files in the raw
converter, and batch process conversion to DNG, and you also have some
additional tab choices for correcting lens distortions, curve settings, and cali-
bration features. (See Figure 16-15.)
Figure 16-15: Photoshop’s raw converter offers many more settings options than does the
Photoshop Elements raw converter.
305
Chapter 16: Ten Reasons to Upgrade to Photoshop

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
One of our favorite options is the ability to make Curves adjustments. If you
use your camera to copy negative film, the file opens in the Camera Raw con-
verter as a negative, as shown in Figure 16-15. It’s almost impossible to set
the proper white balance and make tone adjustments while viewing a nega-
tive image. With just a little adjustment in the Curves tab, you can convert
your negative image into a positive right in the raw converter and then make
changes for white point and brightness/contrast. In Figure 16-16, we flopped
the curve (to convert negative to positive) and moved the points in toward
the image data. This file was much easier to edit as a positive.
Figure 16-16: The Photoshop raw converter enables you to convert negative images into
positives, making tone adjustments much easier.
More Selection Tools
Two tools we find important for creating selections in photos are the Color
Range and Quick Mask tools. Having more options for creating selections
helps you target areas of a photo that need color and brightness corrections.
The Color Range and Quick Mask tools are used for
 Color Range: Makes it easier to target areas, such as flesh tones, that
need color adjustments. The Color Range dialog box offers options for
making selections based on color samples you make with an eyedropper

tool, as shown in Figure 16-17. You can refine selections by moving a
slider (called the Fuzziness slider) in the Color Range dialog box. (The
Fuzziness slider works like an opacity slider.)
 Quick Mask: This tool shows you a selected area with a red overlay
color. You can add to a selection or remove from a selection easily by
painting or removing paint. This tool helps you precisely target selected
areas in a photo, much like the Color Range tool does, where you want
to make corrections for color and brightness adjustments.
Figure 16-17: The Color Range dialog box helps you target 
areas in which you want to color correct and change 
brightness values.
