NEWTONIAN
COSMOLOGY
1.1
Introduction
Many of the modern ideas in cosmology can be explained without the need
to discuss General Relativity. The present chapter represents an attempt to
do this based entirely on Newtonian mechanics. The equations describing
the velocity (called the Friedmann equation) and acceleration of the universe
are derived from Newtonian mechanics and also the cosmological constant
is introduced within a Newtonian framework. The equations of state are
also derived in a very simple way. Applications such as conservation laws,
the age of the universe and the inﬂation, radiation and matter dominated
epochs are discussed.
1.2
Equation of State
In what follows the equation of state for non-relativistic matter and radiation
will be needed. In particular an expression for the rate of change of density,
˙ρ, will be needed in terms of the density ρ and pressure p. (The deﬁnition
˙x ≡dx
dt , where t is time, is being used.) The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is
dU + dW = dQ
(1.1)
where U is the internal energy, W is the work and Q is the heat transfer.
Ignoring any heat transfer and writing dW = Fdr = pdV where F is the
5

CHAPTER 1. NEWTONIAN COSMOLOGY
force, r is the distance, p is the pressure and V is the volume, then
dU = −pdV.
(1.2)
Assuming that ρ is a relativistic energy density means that the energy is
expressed as
U = ρV
(1.3)
from which it follows that
˙U = ˙ρV + ρ ˙V = −p ˙V
(1.4)
where the term on the far right hand side results from equation (1.2). Writing
V ∝r3 implies that
˙V
V = 3 ˙r
r. Thus
˙ρ = −3(ρ + p) ˙r
r
(1.5)
1.2.1
Matter
Writing the density of matter as
ρ =
M
4
3πr3
(1.6)
it follows that
˙ρ ≡dρ
dr ˙r = −3ρ ˙r
r
(1.7)
so that by comparing to equation (1.5), it follows that the equation of state
for matter is
p = 0.
(1.8)
This is the same as obtained from the ideal gas law for zero temperature.
Recall that in this derivation we have not introduced any kinetic energy, so
we are talking about zero temperature.
1.2.2
Radiation
The equation of state for radiation can be derived by considering radiation
modes in a cavity based on analogy with a violin string [12]. For a standing
wave on a string ﬁxed at both ends
L = nλ
2
(1.9)

1.3. VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION EQUATIONS
7
where L is the length of the string, λ is the wavelength and n is a positive
integer (n = 1, 2, 3.....). Radiation travels at the velocity of light, so that
c = fλ = f 2L
n
(1.10)
where f is the frequency. Thus substituting f =
n
2Lc into Planck’s formula
U = ¯hω = hf, where h is Planck’s constant, gives
U = nhc
2
1
L ∝V −1/3.
(1.11)
Using equation (1.2) the pressure becomes
p ≡−dU
dV = 1
3
U
V .
(1.12)
Using ρ = U/V , the radiation equation of state is
p = 1
3ρ.
(1.13)
It is customary to combine the equations of state into the form
p = γ
3ρ
(1.14)
where γ ≡1 for radiation and γ ≡0 for matter. These equations of state
are needed in order to discuss the radiation and matter dominated epochs
which occur in the evolution of the Universe.
1.3
Velocity and Acceleration Equations
The Friedmann equation, which speciﬁes the speed of recession, is obtained
by writing the total energy E as the sum of kinetic plus potential energy
terms (and using M = 4
3πr3ρ )
E = T + V = 1
2m ˙r2 −GMm
r
= 1
2mr2(H2 −8πG
3
ρ)
(1.15)
where the Hubble constant H ≡
˙r
r, m is the mass of a test particle in the
potential energy ﬁeld enclosed by a gas of dust of mass M, r is the distance
from the center of the dust to the test particle and G is Newton’s constant.

CHAPTER 1. NEWTONIAN COSMOLOGY
Recall that the escape velocity is just vescape =
q
2GM
r
=
q
8πG
3 ρr2, so that
the above equation can also be written
˙r2 = v2
escape −k′13 −2
(1.16)
with k′ ≡−2E
m . The constant k′ can either be negative, zero or positive
corresponding to the total energy E being positive, zero or negative. For
a particle in motion near the Earth this would correspond to the particle
escaping (unbound), orbiting (critical case) or returning (bound) to Earth
because the speed ˙r would be greater, equal to or smaller than the escape
speed vescape. Later this will be analagous to an open, ﬂat or closed universe.
Equation (1.15) is re-arranged as
H2 = 8πG
3
ρ + 2E
mr2 .13 −3
(1.17)
Deﬁning k ≡−2E
ms2 and writing the distance in terms of the scale factor R
and a constant length s as r(t) ≡R(t)s, it follows that
˙r
r =
˙R
R and ¨r
r =
¨R
R,
giving the Friedmann equation
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
ρ −k
R2
(1.18)
which speciﬁes the speed of recession. The scale factor is introduced because
in General Relativity it is space itself which expands [19]. Even though this
equation is derived for matter, it is also true for radiation. (In fact it is also
true for vacuum, with Λ ≡8πGρvac, where Λ is the cosmological constant
and ρvac is the vacuum energy density which just replaces the ordinary den-
sity. This is discussed later.) Exactly the same equation is obtained from
the general relativistic Einstein ﬁeld equations [13]. According to Guth [10],
k can be rescaled so that instead of being negative, zero or positive it takes
on the values −1, 0 or +1. From a Newtonian point of view this corresponds
to unbound, critical or bound trajectories as mentioned above. From a geo-
metric, general relativistic point of view this corresponds to an open, ﬂat or
closed universe.
In elementary mechanics the speed v of a ball dropped from a height r
is evaluated from the conservation of energy equation as v = √2gr, where
g is the acceleration due to gravity. The derivation shown above is exactly
analagous to such a calculation. Similarly the acceleration a of the ball is
calculated as a = g from Newton’s equation F = m¨r, where F is the force

1.4. COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT
9
and the acceleration is ¨r ≡d2r
dt2 . The acceleration for the universe is obtained
from Newton’s equation
−GMm
r2
= m¨r.13 −5
(1.19)
Again using M = 4
3πr3ρ and ¨r
r = ¨R
R gives the acceleration equation
F
mr ≡¨r
r ≡
¨R
R = −4πG
3
ρ.
(1.20)
However because M =
4
3πr3ρ was used, it is clear that this acceleration
equation holds only for matter. In our example of the falling ball instead of
the acceleration being obtained from Newton’s Law, it can also be obtained
by taking the time derivative of the energy equation to give a = dv
dt = v dv
dr =
(√2gr)(√2g
1
2√r) = g. Similarly, for the general case one can take the time
derivative of equation (1.18) (valid for matter and radiation)
d
dt
˙R2 = 2 ˙R ¨R = 8πG
3

dt(ρR2).
(1.21)
Upon using equation (1.5) the acceleration equation is obtained as
¨R
R = −4πG
3
(ρ + 3p) = −4πG
3
(1 + γ)ρ
(1.22)
which reduces to equation (1.20) for the matter equation of state (γ = 0).
Exactly the same equation is obtained from the Einstein ﬁeld equations [13].
1.4
Cosmological Constant
In both Newtonian and relativistic cosmology the universe is unstable to
gravitational collapse. Both Newton and Einstein believed that the Universe
is static. In order to obtain this Einstein introduced a repulsive gravitational
force, called the cosmological constant, and Newton could have done exactly
the same thing, had he believed the universe to be ﬁnite.
In order to obtain a possibly zero acceleration, a positive term (conven-
tionally taken as Λ
3 ) is added to the acceleration equation (1.22) as
¨R
R = −4πG
3
(ρ + 3p) + Λ
3
(1.23)

10
CHAPTER 1. NEWTONIAN COSMOLOGY
which, with the proper choice of Λ can give the required zero acceleration
for a static universe. Again exactly the same equation is obtained from the
Einstein ﬁeld equations [13]. What has been done here is entirely equivalent
to just adding a repulsive gravitational force in Newton’s Law. The question
now is how this repulsive force enters the energy equation (1.18). Identifying
the force from
¨r
r =
¨R
R ≡Frepulsive
mr

(1.24)
and using
Frepulsive = Λ

(1.25)
gives the potential energy as
Vrepulsive = −1

Λ

(1.26)
which is just a repulsive simple harmonic oscillator. Substituting this into
the conservation of energy equation

gives
H2 ≡(

R)2 = 8πG
3
ρ −k
R2 + Λ
3 .
(1.28)
Equations (1.28) and (1.23) constitute the fundamental equations of motion
that are used in all discussions of Friedmann models of the Universe. Exactly
the same equations are obtained from the Einstein ﬁeld equations [13].
Let us comment on the repulsive harmonic oscillator obtained above.
Recall one of the standard problems often assigned in mechanics courses.
The problem is to imagine that a hole has been drilled from one side of the
Earth, through the center and to the other side. One is to show that if a
ball is dropped into the hole, it will execute harmonic motion. The solution
is obtained by noting that whereas gravity is an inverse square law for point
masses M and m separated by a distance r as given by F = G Mm
r2 , yet if one
of the masses is a continous mass distribution represented by a density then
F = G4
3πρmr. The force rises linearly as the distance is increased because
the amount of matter enclosed keeps increasing. Thus the gravitational force
for a continuous mass distribution rises like Hooke’s law and thus oscillatory
solutions are encountered. This sheds light on our repulsive oscillator found

1.4. COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT
11
above. In this case we want the gravity to be repulsive, but the cosmological
constant acts just like the uniform matter distribution.
Finally authors often write the cosmological constant in terms of a vac-
uum energy density as Λ ≡8πGρvac so that the velocity and acceleration
equations become
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
ρ −k
R2 + Λ
3 = 8πG

and
¨R

(1 + γ)ρ + 8πG

ρvac.
(1.30)
1.4.1
Einstein Static Universe
Although we have noted that the cosmological constant provides repulsion,
it is interesting to calculate its exact value for a static universe [14, 15]. The
Einstein static universe requires R = R0 = constant and thus ˙R = ¨R = 0.
The case ¨R = 0 will be examined ﬁrst. From equation (1.23) this requires
that
Λ = 4πG(ρ + 3p) = 4πG(1 + γ)ρ.
(1.31)
If there is no cosmological constant (Λ = 0) then either ρ = 0 which is an
empty universe, or p = −1
3ρ which requires negative pressure. Both of these
alternatives were unacceptable to Einstein and therefore he concluded that
a cosmological constant was present, i.e. Λ ̸= 0. From equation (1.31) this
implies
ρ =
Λ
4πG(1 + γ)
(1.32)
and because ρ is positive this requires a positive Λ.
Substituting equa-
tion (1.32) into equation (1.28) it follows that
Λ = 3(1 + γ)
3 + γ
[(
˙R
R0
)2 + k
R2
0
].
(1.33)
Now imposing ˙R = 0 and assuming a matter equation of state (γ = 0)
implies Λ =
k
R2
0 . However the requirement that Λ be positive forces k = +1
giving
Λ = 1
R2
0
= constant.
(1.34)

12
CHAPTER 1. NEWTONIAN COSMOLOGY
Thus the cosmological constant is not any old value but rather simply the
inverse of the scale factor squared, where the scale factor has a ﬁxed value
in this static model.

Chapter 2
APPLICATIONS
2.1
Conservation laws
Just as the Maxwell equations imply the conservation of charge, so too do
our velocity and acceleration equations imply conservation of energy. The
energy-momentum conservation equation is derived by setting the covariant
derivative of the energy momentum tensor equal to zero. The same result is
achieved by taking the time derivative of equation (1.29). The result is
˙ρ + 3(ρ + p)
˙R
R = 0.
(2.1)
This is identical to equation (1.5) illustrating the intersting connection be-
tweeen thermodynamics and General Relativity that has been discussed re-
cently [16]. The point is that we used thermodynamics to derive our velocity
and acceleration equations and it is no surprise that the thermodynamic for-
mula drops out again at the end. However, the velocity and acceleration
equations can be obtained directly from the Einstein ﬁeld equations. Thus
the Einstein equations imply this thermodynamic relationship in the above
equation.
The above equation can also be written as
d
dt(ρR3) + pdR3
dt
= 0
(2.2)
and from equation (1.14), 3(ρ + p) = (3 + γ)ρ, it follows that
d
dt(ρR3+γ) = 0.
(2.3)
13

14
CHAPTER 2. APPLICATIONS
Integrating this we obtain
ρ =
c
R3+γ
(2.4)
where c is a constant. This shows that the density falls as
1
R3 for matter and
1
R4 for radiation as expected.
Later we shall use these equations in a diﬀerent form as follows. From
equation (2.1),
ρ′ + 3(ρ + p) 1
R = 0
(2.5)
where primes denote derivatives with respect to R, i.e. x′ ≡dx/dR. Alter-
natively
d
dR(ρR3) + 3pR2 = 0
(2.6)
so that
1
R3+γ
d
dR(ρR3+γ) = 0
(2.7)
which is consistent with equation (2.4)
2.2
Age of the Universe
Recent measurements made with the Hubble space telescope [17] have de-
termined that the age of the universe is younger than globular clusters. A
possible resolution to this paradox involves the cosmological constant [18].
We illustrate this as follows.
Writing equation (1.28) as
˙R2 = 8πG
3
(ρ + ρvac)R2 −k
(2.8)
the present day value of k is
k = 8πG
3
(ρ0 + ρ0vac)R2
0 −H2
0R2
0
(2.9)
with H2 ≡( ˙R
R)2. Present day values of quantities have been denoted with a
subscript 0. Substituting equation (2.9) into equation (2.8) yields
˙R2 = 8πG
3
(ρR2 −ρ0R2
0 + ρvacR2 −ρ0vacR2
0) −H2
0R2

(2.10)

.
(2.11)
For the cosmological constant ρvac = ρ0vac and because R2 < R2
0 then a
non zero cosmological constant will give an age larger than would have been
obtained were it not present.
Our aim here is simply to show that the
inclusion of a cosmological constant gives an age which is larger than if no
constant were present.
2.3
Inﬂation
In this section only a ﬂat k = 0 universe will be discussed.
Results for
an open or closed universe can easily be obtained and are discussed in the
references [13].
Currently the universe is in a matter dominated phase whereby the dom-
inant contribution to the energy density is due to matter. However the early
universe was radiation dominated and the very early universe was vacuum
dominated. Setting k = 0, there will only be one term on the right hand
side of equation (1.29) depending on what is dominating the universe. For a
matter (γ = 0) or radiation (γ = 1) dominated universe the right hand side
will be of the form
1
R3+γ (ignoring vacuum energy), whereas for a vacuum
dominated universe the right hand side will be a constant. The solution
to the Friedmann equation for a radiation dominated universe will thus be
R ∝t
1
2 , while for the matter dominated case it will be R ∝t
2
3 . One can see
that these results give negative acceleration, corresponding to a decelerating
expanding universe.
Inﬂation [19] occurs when the vacuum energy contribution dominates the
ordinary density and curvature terms in equation (1.29). Assuming these
are negligible and substituting Λ = constant, results in R ∝exp(t). The
acceleration is positive, corresponding to an accelerating expanding universe
called an inﬂationary universe.

Derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation
The Wheeler-DeWitt equation will be derived in analogy with the 1 dimen-
sional Schr¨odinger equation, which we derive herein for completeness. The
Lagrangian L for a single particle moving in a potential V is
L = T −V
(2.12)
where T = 1
2m ˙x2 is the kinetic energy, V is the potential energy. The action
is S =
R Ldt and varying the action according to δS = 0 results in the
Euler-Lagrange equation (equation of motion)

(Note P is the momentum but p is the pressure.) The Hamiltonian H is
deﬁned as
H(P, x) ≡P ˙x −L( ˙x, x).
(2.16)
For many situations of physical interest, such as a single particle moving in
a harmonic oscillator potential V = 1
2kx2, the Hamiltonian becomes
H = T + V = P 2
2m + V = E
(2.17)
where E is the total energy. Quantization is achieved by the operator re-
placements P →ˆP = −i ∂
∂x and E →ˆE = i ∂
∂t where we are leaving oﬀ
factors of ¯h and we are considering the 1-dimensional equation only. The
Schr¨odinger equation is obtained by writing the Hamiltonian as an operator
ˆH acting on a wave function Ψ as in
ˆHΨ = ˆEΨ
(2.18)
and making the above operator replacements to obtain
(−1

∂2
∂x2 + V )Ψ = i ∂
∂tΨ
(2.19)
which is the usual form of the 1-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation written
in conﬁguration space.

Wheeler-DeWitt equation
The discussion of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace ap-
proximation [20, 21, 11, 22] is usually restricted to closed (k = +1) and
empty (ρ = 0) universes. Atkatz [11] presented a very nice discussion for
closed and empty universes. Herein we consider closed, open and ﬂat and
non-empty universes. It is important to consider the possible presence of
matter and radiation as they might otherwise change the conclusions. Thus
presented below is a derivation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the min-
isuperspace approximation which also includes matter and radiation and
arbitrary values of k.
The Lagrangian is
L = −κR3[(
˙R
R)2 −k
R2 + 8πG
3
(ρ + ρvac)]
(2.20)
with κ ≡3π
4G. The momentum conjugate to R is
P ≡∂L
∂˙R = −κ2R ˙R.
(2.21)
Substituting L and P into the Euler-Lagrange equation, ˙P −∂L
∂R = 0, equa-
tion (1.29) is recovered. (Note the calculation of ∂L
∂R is simpliﬁed by using
the conservation equation (2.5) with equation (1.14), namely ρ′ + ρ′
vac =
−(3 + γ)ρ/R). The Hamiltonian H ≡P ˙R −L is
H( ˙R, R) = −κR3[(
˙R
R)2 + k
R2 −8πG
3
(ρ + ρvac)] ≡0
(2.22)
which has been written in terms of ˙R to show explicitly that the Hamiltonian
is identically zero and is not equal to the total energy as before. (Compare
equation (1.29)). In terms of the conjugate momentum
H(P, R) = −κR3[
P 2
4κ2R4 + k
R2 −8πG
3
(ρ + ρvac)] = 0
(2.23)
which, of course is also equal to zero. Making the replacement P →−i ∂
∂R
and imposing HΨ = 0 results in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the min-
isuperspace approximation for arbitrary k and with matter or radiation (ρ
term) included gives
{−∂2
∂R2 + 9π2
4G2 [(kR2 −8πG
3
(ρ + ρvac)R4]}Ψ = 0.
(2.24)

CHAPTER 2. APPLICATIONS
Using equation (2.4) the Wheeler-DeWitt equation becomes
{−∂2
∂R2 + 9π2
4G2 [kR2 −Λ
3 R4 −8πG

cR1−γ]}Ψ = 0.
(2.25)
This just looks like the zero energy Schr¨odinger equation [21] with a potential
given by
V (R) = kR2 −Λ
3 R4 −8πG
3
cR1−γ.
(2.26)
For the empty Universe case of no matter or radiation (c = 0) the po-
tential V (R) is plotted in Figure 1 for the cases k = +1, 0, −1 respectively
corresponding to closed [21], open and ﬂat universes. It can be seen that only
the closed universe case provides a potential barrier through which tunnel-
ing can occur. This provides a clear illustration of the idea that only closed
universes can arise through quantum tunneling [22]. If radiation (γ = 1 and
c ̸= 0) is included then only a negative constant will be added to the poten-
tial (because the term R1−γ will be constant for γ = 1) and these conclusions
about tunneling will not change. The shapes in Figure 1 will be identical
except that the whole graph will be shifted downwards by a constant with
the inclusion of radiation. (For matter (γ = 0 and c ̸= 0) a term growing
like R will be included in the potential which will only be important for very
small R and so the conclusions again will not be changed.) To summarize,
only closed universes can arise from quantum tunneling even if matter or
radiation are present.

3.1
Contravariant and Covariant Vectors
Let us imagine that an ’ordinary’ 2-dimensional vector has components (x, y)
or (x1, x2) (read as x superscript 2 not x squared) in a certain coordinate
system and components (x, y) or (x1, x2) when that coordinate system is ro-
tated by angle θ (but with the vector remaining ﬁxed). Then the components
are related by [1]
Ã
x
y
!
=
Ã
cos θ
sin θ
sin θ
cos θ

!
(3.1)
Notice that we are using superscipts (xi) for the components of our or-
dinary vectors (instead of the usual subscripts used in freshman physics),
which henceforth we are going to name contravariant vectors. We empha-
size that these are just the ordinary vectors one comes across in freshman
physics.
Expanding the matrix equation we have
x = x cos θ + y sin θ
(3.2)
y = −x sin θ + y cos θ
from which it follows that
∂x
∂x = cos θ
∂x
∂y = sin θ
(3.3)

∂y
∂x = −sin θ

∂y = cos θ
so that
x = ∂x
∂xx + ∂x
∂y y
(3.4)
y = ∂y
∂xx + ∂y
∂yy
which can be written compactly as
xi = ∂xi
∂xj xj
(3.5)
where we will always be using the Einstein summation convention for doubly
repeated indices. (i.e. xiyi ≡P
i xiyi)
Instead of deﬁning an ordinary (contravariant) vector as a little arrow
pointing in some direction, we shall instead deﬁne it as an object whose com-
ponents transform according to equation(3.5). This is just a fancy version
of equation(3.1), which is another way to deﬁne a vector as what happens
to the components upon rotation (instead of the deﬁnition of a vector as a
little arrow). Notice that we could have written down a diferential version
of (3.5) just from what we know about calculus. Using the inﬁnitessimal dxi
(instead of xi) it follows immediately that
dxi = ∂xi
∂xj dxj
(3.6)
which is identical to (3.5) and therefore we must say that dxi forms an
ordinary or contravariant vector (or an inﬁnitessimally tiny arrow).
While we are on the subject of calculus and inﬁnitessimals let’s think
about
∂
∂xi which is kind of like the ’inverse’ of dxi. From calculus if f =
f(x, y) and x = x(x, y) and y = y(x, y) (which is what (3.3) is saying) then
∂f
∂x = ∂f

or simply
∂f
∂xi = ∂f
∂xj
∂xj
∂xi .
(3.8)

3.1. CONTRAVARIANT AND COVARIANT VECTORS
25
Let’s ’remove’ f and just write
∂
∂xi = ∂xj
∂xi
∂
∂xj .
(3.9)
which we see is similar to (3.5), and so we might expect that ∂/∂xi are
the ’components’ of a ’non-ordinary’ vector. Notice that the index is in the
denominator, so instead of writing ∂/∂xi let’s just always write it as xi for
shorthand. Or equivalently deﬁne
xi ≡
∂
∂xi
(3.10)
Thus
xi = ∂xj
∂xi xj.
(3.11)
So now let’s deﬁne a contravariant vector Aµ as anything whose components
transform as (compare (3.5))
Aµ ≡∂xµ
∂xν Aν
(3.12)
and a covariant vector Aµ (often also called a one-form, or dual vector or
covector)
Aµ = ∂xν
∂xµ Aν
(3.13)
In calculus we have two fundamental objects dxi and the dual vector ∂/∂xi.
If we try to form the dual dual vector ∂/∂(∂/∂xi) we get back dxi [2]. A
set of points in a smooth space is called a manifold and where dxi forms a
space, ∂/∂xi forms the corresponding ’dual’ space [2]. The dual of the dual
space is just the original space dxi. Contravariant and covariant vectors are
the dual of each other. Other examples of dual spaces are row and column
matrices (x
y) and
Ã
x
y
!
and the kets < a| and bras |a > used in quantum
mechanics [3].
Before proceeding let’s emphasize again that our deﬁnitions of contravari-
ant and covariant vectors in (3.13) and (3.13) are nothing more than fancy
versions of (3.1).

CHAPTER 3. TENSORS
3.2
Higher Rank Tensors
Notice that our vector components Aµ have one index, whereas a scalar
(e.g. t = time or T = temperature) has zero indices. Thus scalars are called
tensors of rank zero and vectors are called tensors of rank one.
We are
familiar with matrices which have two indices Aij. A contravariant tensor of
rank two is of the form Aµν, rank three Aµνγ etc. A mixed tensor, e.g. Aµ
ν,
is partly covariant and partly contravariant.
In order for an object to be called a tensor it must satisfy the tensor
transformation rules, examples of which are (3.13) and (3.13) and
T µν = ∂xµ
∂xα ∂xν
∂xβ T αβ.
(3.14)
T µ
ν = ∂xµ
∂xα
∂xβ
∂xν T α
β .
(3.15)
T µν
ρ
= ∂xµ
∂xα
∂xν
∂xβ
∂xγ
∂xρ T αβ
γ .
(3.16)
Thus even though a matrix has two indices Aij, it may not necessarily be
a second rank tensor unless it satisﬁes the above tensor tranformation rules
as well. However all second rank tensors can be written as matrices.
Higher rank tensors can be constructed from lower rank ones by forming
what is called the outer product or tensor product [14] as follows. For instance
T α
β ≡AαBβ
(3.17)
or
T αβ
γδ ≡Aα
γBβ
δ .
(3.18)
The tensor product is often written simply as
T = A ⊗B
(3.19)
(do Problem 3.1) (NNN Next time discuss wedge product - easy - just
introduce antisymmetry).
We can also construct lower rank tensors from higher rank ones by a
process called contraction, which sets a covariant and contravariant index
equal, and because of the Einstein summation convention equal or repeated

3.3. REVIEW OF CARTESIAN TENSORS
27
indices are summed over. Thus contraction represents setting two indices
equal and summing. For example
T αβ
γβ ≡T α
γ
(3.20)
Thus contraction over a pair of indices reduces the rank of a tensor by two
[14].
The inner product [14] of two tensors is deﬁned by forming the outer
product and then contracting over a pair of indices as
T α
β ≡Aα
γBγ
β.
(3.21)
Clearly the inner product of two vectors (rank one tensors) produces a scalar
(rank zero tensor) as
AµBµ = constant ≡A.B
(3.22)
and it can be shown that A.B as deﬁned here is a scalar (do Problem 3.2).
A scalar is a tensor of rank zero with the very special transformation law of
invariance
c = c.
(3.23)
It is easily shown, for example, that AµBµ is no good as a deﬁnition of inner
product for vectors because it is not invariant under transformations and
therefore is not a scalar.
3.3
Review of Cartesian Tensors
Let us review the scalar product that we used in freshman physics. We wrote
vectors as A = Aiˆei and deﬁned the scalar product as
A.B ≡AB cos θ
(3.24)
where A and B are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B and θ is the
angle between them. Thus
A.B = Aiˆei.Bjˆej
= (ˆei.ˆej)AiBj
≡gijAiBj
(3.25)

28
CHAPTER 3. TENSORS
where the metric tensor gij is deﬁned as the dot product of the basis vectors.
A Cartesian basis is deﬁned as one in which gij ≡δij (obtained from
ˆei.ˆej = |ˆei||ˆej| cos θ = cos θ = δij). That is, the basis vectors are of unit
length and perpendicular to each other in which case
A.B = AiBi
= AxBx + AyBy + ....
(3.26)
where the sum (+...) extends to however many dimensions are being consid-
ered and
A.A ≡A2 = AiAi
(3.27)
which is just Pythagoras’ theorem, A.A ≡A2 = AiAi = A2
x + A2
y + .......
Notice that the usual results we learned about in freshman physics, equa-
tions (3.26) and (3.27), result entirely from requiring gij = δij =
Ã
1

in matrix notation.
We could easily have deﬁned a non-Cartesian space, for example, gij =
Ã
1
1
0
1
!
in which case Pythagoras’ theorem would change to
A.A ≡A2 = AiAi = A2
x + A2
y + AxAy.
(3.28)
Thus it is the metric tensor gij ≡ˆei.ˆej given by the scalar product of the
unit vectors which (almost) completely deﬁnes the vector space that we are
considering. Now let’s return to vectors and one-forms (i.e. contravariant
and covariant vectors).
3.4
Metric Tensor
We have already seen (in Problem 3.2) that the inner product deﬁned by
A.B ≡AµBµ transforms as a scalar. (The choice AµBµ won’t do because
it is not a scalar). However based on the previous section, we would expect
that A.B can also be written in terms of a metric tensor. The most natural
way to do this is
A.B ≡AµBµ
= gµνAνBµ
(3.29)
assuming gµν is a tensor.

3.4. METRIC TENSOR
29
In fact deﬁning A.B ≡AµBµ ≡gµνAνBµ makes perfect sense because it
also transforms as a scalar (i.e. is invariant). (do Problem 3.3) Thus either
of the two right hand sides of (3.29) will do equally well as the deﬁnition of
the scalar product, and thus we deduce that
Aµ = gµνAν
(3.30)
so that the metric tensor has the eﬀect of lowering indices. Similarly it can
raise indices
Aµ = gµνAν
(3.31)
How is vector A written in terms of basis vectors ? Based on our expe-
rience with Cartesian vectors let’s deﬁne our basis vectors such that
A.B ≡AµBµ
= gµνAνBµ
≡(eµ.eν)AνBµ
(3.32)
which imples that vectors can be written in terms of components and basis
vectors as
A = Aµeµ
= Aµeµ
(3.33)
Thus the basis vectors of a covariant vector (one-form) transform as con-
travariant vectors. Contravariant components have basis vectors that trans-
form as one-froms [5] (pg. 63-64).
The above results illuminate our ﬂat (Cartesian) space results where
gµν ≡δµν, so that (3.31) becomes Aµ = Aµ showing that in ﬂat space there
is no distinction between covariant and contravariant vectors. Because of
this it also follows that A = Aµˆeµ and A.B = AµBµ which were our ﬂat
space results.
Two more points to note are the symmetry
gµν = gνµ
(3.34)

and the inverse deﬁned by
gµαgαν = δν
µ = gν
µ
(3.35)
so that gν
µ is the Kronecker delta. This follows by getting back what we start
with as in Aµ = gµνAν = gµνgναAα ≡δα
µAα.

(3.37)
If a contravariant vector is speciﬁed by
Aµ = (A0, Ai) = (A0, A)
(3.38)
it follows that the covariant vector is Aµ = ηµνAν or
Aµ = (A0, Ai) = (A0, −A)
(3.39)
Note that A0 = A0.
Exercise: Prove equation (3.39) using (3.38) and (3.37).
Thus, for example, the energy momentum four vector pµ = (E, p) gives
p2 = E2 −p2.
Of course p2 is the invariant we identify as m2 so that
E2 = p2 + m2.
Because of equation (3.38) we must have
∂µ ≡
∂
∂xµ = ( ∂
∂x0 , ▽) = ( ∂
∂t, ▽)
(3.40)
implying that

Let us now brieﬂy discuss the fourvelocity uµ and proper time. We shall
write out c explicitly here.
Using dxµ ≡(cdt, dx) the invariant interval is
ds2 ≡dxµdxµ = c2dt2 −dx2.
(3.43)
The proper time τ is deﬁned via
ds ≡cdτ = cdt
γ
(3.44)
which is consistent with the time dilation eﬀect as the proper time is the
time measured in an observer’s rest frame. The fourvelocity is deﬁned as
uµ ≡dxµ
dτ ≡(γc, γv)
(3.45)
such that the fourmomentum is
pµ ≡muµ = (E
c , p)
(3.46)
where m is the rest mass.
Exercise: Check that (muµ)2 = m2c2. (This must be true so that E2 =
(pc)2 + (mc2)2).
3.5
Christoﬀel Symbols
Some good references for this section are [7, 14, 8]. In electrodynamics in
ﬂat spacetime we encounter
E = −⃗▽φ
(3.47)
and
B = ⃗▽× A
(3.48)

32
CHAPTER 3. TENSORS
where E and B are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and φ and A are the scalar
and vectors potentials. ⃗▽is the gradient operator deﬁned (in 3 dimensions)
as
⃗▽≡ˆi∂/∂x + ˆj∂/∂y + ˆk∂/∂z
= ˆe1∂/∂x1 + ˆe2∂/∂x2 + ˆe3∂/∂x3.
(3.49)
Clearly then φ and A are functions of x, y, z, i.e. φ = φ(x, y, z) and
A = A(x, y, z). Therefore φ is called a scalar ﬁeld and A is called a vector
ﬁeld. E and B are also vector ﬁelds because their values are a function of
position also. (The electric ﬁeld of a point charge gets smaller when you
move away.) Because the left hand sides are vectors, (3.47) and (3.48) imply
that the derivatives ⃗▽φ and ⃗▽× A also transform as vectors. What about
the derivative of tensors in our general curved spacetime ? Do they also
transform as tensors ?
Consider a vector ﬁeld Aµ(xν) as a function of contravariant coordinates.
Let us introduce a shorthand for the derivative as
Aµ,ν ≡∂Aµ
∂xν
(3.50)
We want to know whether the derivative Aµ,ν is a tensor. That is does Aµ,ν
transform according to Aµ,ν = ∂xα
∂xµ ∂xβ
∂xν Aα,β. ? To ﬁnd out, let’s evaluate the
derivative explicitly
Aµ,ν ≡∂Aµ
∂xν =
∂
∂xν (∂xα
∂xµ Aα)
= ∂xα
∂xµ
∂Aα
∂xν +
∂2xα
∂xν∂xµ Aα
(3.51)
but Aα is a function of xν not xν, i.e. Aα = Aα(xν) ̸= Aα(xν) . Therefore
we must insert ∂Aα
∂xν = ∂Aα
∂xγ ∂xγ
∂xν so that
Aµ,ν ≡∂Aµ
∂xν = ∂xα
∂xµ
∂xγ
∂xν
∂Aα
∂xγ +
∂2xα
∂xν∂xµ Aα
= ∂xα
∂xµ
∂xγ
∂xν Aα,γ +
∂2xα
∂xν∂xµ Aα
(3.52)
We see therefore that the tensor transformation law for Aµ,ν is spoiled by
the second term. Thus Aµ,ν is not a tensor [8, 7, 14].

3.5. CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS
33
To see why this problem occurs we should look at the deﬁnition of the
derivative [8],
Aµ,ν ≡∂Aµ
∂xν = lim
dx→0
Aµ(x + dx) −Aµ(x)
dxν
(3.53)
or more properly [7, 14] as limdxγ→0
Aµ(xγ+dxγ)−Aµ(xγ)
dxν
.
The problem however with (3.53) is that the numerator is not a vector
because Aµ(x + dx) and Aµ(x) are located at diﬀerent points. The diﬀernce
between two vectors is only a vector if they are located at the same point.
The diﬀerence betweeen two vectors located at separate points is not a vector
because the transformations laws (3.12) and (3.13) depend on position. In
freshman physics when we represent two vectors A and B as little arrows,
the diﬀerence A −B is not even deﬁned (i.e. is not a vector) if A and B
are at diﬀerent points. We ﬁrst instruct the freshman student to slide one
of the vectors to the other one and only then we can visualize the diﬀerence
between them. This sliding is achieved by moving one of the vectors parallel
to itself (called parallel transport), which is easy to do in ﬂat space. Thus
to compare two vectors (i.e. compute A −B) we must ﬁrst put them at the
same spacetime point.
Thus in order to calculate Aµ(x + dx) −Aµ(x) we must ﬁrst deﬁne what
is meant by parallel transport in a general curved space. When we parallel
transport a vector in ﬂat space its components don’t change when we move
it around, but they do change in curved space. Imagine standing on the
curved surface of the Earth, say in Paris, holding a giant arrow (let’s call
this vector A) vertically upward. If you walk from Paris to Moscow and keep
the arrow pointed upward at all times (in other words transport the vector
parallel to itself), then an astronaut viewing the arrow from a stationary
position in space will notice that the arrow points in diﬀerent directions in
Moscow compared to Paris, even though according to you, you have par-
allel transported the vector and it still points vertically upward from the
Earth. Thus the astronaut sees the arrow pointing in a diﬀerent direction
and concludes that it is not the same vector. (It can’t be because it points
diﬀerently; it’s orientation has changed.) Thus parallel transport produces a
diﬀerent vector.
Vector A has changed into a diﬀerent vector C.
To ﬁx this situation, the astronaut communicates with you by radio and
views your arrow through her spacecraft window. She makes a little mark
on her window to line up with your arrow in Paris. She then draws a whole
series of parallel lines on her window and as you walk from Paris to Moscow
she keeps instructing you to keep your arrow parallel to the lines on her

34
CHAPTER 3. TENSORS
window. When you get to Moscow, she is satisﬁed that you haven’t rotated
your arrow compared to the markings on her window. If a vector is parallel
transported from an ’absolute’ point of view (the astronaut’s window), then
it must still be the same vector A, except now moved to a diﬀerent point
(Moscow).
Let’s denote δAµ as the change produced in vector Aµ(xα) located at xα
by an inﬁnitessimal parallel transport by a distance dxα. We expect δAµ to
be directly proportional to dxα.
δAµ ∝dxα
(3.54)
We also expect δAµ to be directly proportional to Aµ; the bigger our arrow,
the more noticeable its change will be. Thus
δAµ ∝Aνdxα
(3.55)
The only sensible constant of proportionality will have to have covariant µ
and α indices and a contravariant ν index as
δAµ ≡Γν
µαAνdxα
(3.56)
where Γν
µα are called Christoﬀel symbols or coeﬃcients of aﬃne connection
or simply connection coeﬃcients . As Narlikar [7] points out, whereas the
metric tensor tells us how to deﬁne distance betweeen neighboring points, the
connection coeﬃcients tell us how to deﬁne parallelism betweeen neighboring
points.
Equation (3.56) deﬁnes parallel transport. δAµ is the change produced
in vector Aµ by an inﬁnitessimal transport by a distance dxα to produce a
new vector Cµ ≡Aµ + δAµ. To obtain parallel transport for a contravariant
vector Bµ note that a scalar deﬁned as AµBµ cannot change under parallel
transport. Thus [8]
δ(AµBµ) = 0
(3.57)
from which it follows that (do Problem 3.4)
δAµ ≡−Γµ
ναAνdxα.
(3.58)
We shall also assume [8] symmetry under exchange of lower indices,
Γα
µν = Γα
νµ.
(3.59)
(We would have a truly crazy space if this wasn’t true [8]. Think about it !)

3.5. CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS
35
Continuing with our consideration of Aµ(xα) parallel transported an in-
ﬁnitessimal distance dxα, the new vector Cµ will be
Cµ = Aµ + δAµ.
(3.60)
whereas the old vector Aµ(xα) at the new position xα +dxα will be Aµ(xα +
dxα) . The diﬀerence betweeen them is
dAµ = Aµ(xα + dxα) −[Aµ(xα) + δAµ]
(3.61)
which by construction is a vector. Thus we are led to a new deﬁnition of
derivative (which is a tensor [8])
Aµ;ν ≡dAµ
dxν = lim
dx→0
Aµ(x + dx) −[Aµ(x) + δAµ]
dxν
(3.62)
Using (3.53) in (3.61) we have dAµ = ∂Aµ
∂xν dxν −δAµ = ∂Aµ
∂xν dxν −Γϵ
µαAϵdxα
and (3.62) becomes Aµ;ν ≡dAµ
dxν = ∂Aµ
∂xν −Γϵ
µνAϵ (because dxα
dxν = δα
ν ) which
we shall henceforth write as
Aµ;ν ≡Aµ,ν −Γϵ
µνAϵ
(3.63)
where Aµ,ν ≡∂Aµ
∂xν . The derivative Aµ;ν is often called the covariant deriva-
tive (with the word covariant not meaning the same as before) and one can
easily verify that Aµ;ν is a second rank tensor (which will be done later in
Problem 3.5). From (3.58)
Aµ
;ν ≡Aµ
,ν + Γµ

(3.64)
For tensors of higher rank the results are, for example, [14, 8]

Christoﬀel Symbols and Metric Tensor
We shall now derive an important formula which gives the Christoﬀel symbol
in terms of the metric tensor and its derivatives [8, 14, 7]. The formula is
Γα
βγ = 1
2gαϵ(gϵβ,γ + gϵγ,β −gβγ,ϵ).
(3.69)
Another result we wish to prove is that
Γϵ
µϵ = (ln √−g),µ = 1
2[ln(−g)],µ
(3.70)
where
g ≡determinant|gµν|.
(3.71)
Note that g ̸= |gµν|. Let us now prove these results.
Proof of Equation (3.69). The process of covariant diﬀerentiation should
never change the length of a vector. To ensure this means that the covariant
derivative of the metric tensor should always be identically zero,
gµν;λ ≡0.
(3.72)
Applying (3.66)
gµν;λ ≡gµν,λ −Γϵ
µλgϵν −Γϵ
νλgµϵ ≡0
(3.73)

3.6. CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS AND METRIC TENSOR
37
Thus
gµν,λ = Γϵ
µλgϵν + Γϵ
νλgµϵ
(3.74)
and permuting the µνλ indices cyclically gives
gλµ,ν = Γϵ
λνgϵµ + Γϵ
µνgλϵ
(3.75)
and
gνλ,µ = Γϵ
νµgϵλ + Γϵ
λµgνϵ
(3.76)
Now add (3.75) and (3.76) and subtract (3.74) gives [8]
gλµ,ν + gνλ,µ −gµν,λ = 2Γϵ
µνgλϵ
(3.77)
because of the symmetries of (3.59) and (3.34). Multiplying (3.77) by gλα
and using (3.34) and (3.35) (to give gλϵgλα = gϵλgλα = δα
ϵ ) yields
Γα
µν = 1
2gλα(gλµ,ν + gνλ,µ −gµν,λ).
(3.78)
which gives (3.69). (do Problems 3.5 and 3.6).
Proof of equation (3.70) [14] (Appendix II) Using gαϵgϵβ,α = gαϵgβα,ϵ
(obtained using the symmetry of the metric tensor and swapping the names
of indices) and contracting over αν, equation (3.69) becomes (ﬁrst and last
terms cancel)
Γα
β,α = 1
2gαϵ(gϵβ,α + gϵα,β −gβα,ϵ).
= 1
2gαϵgϵα,β
(3.79)
Deﬁning g as the determinant |gµν| and using (3.35) it follows that
∂g
∂gµν
= ggµν
(3.80)
a result which can be easily checked. (do Problem 3.7) Thus (3.79) be-
comes
Γα
β,α = 1
2g
∂g
∂gλα
∂gλα
∂xβ
= 1
2g
∂g
∂xβ
= 1

(3.81)
which is (3.70), where in (3.70) we write ln(−g) instead of ln g because g is
always negative.

Riemann Curvature Tensor
The Riemann curvature tensor is one of the most important tensors in gen-
eral relativity.
If it is zero then it means that the space is ﬂat.
If it is
non-zero then we have a curved space. This tensor is most easily derived
by considering the order of double diﬀerentiation on tensors [28, 2, 9, 7, 8].
Firstly we write in general
Aµ
,αβ ≡
∂2Aµ
∂xα∂xβ
(3.82)
and also when we write Aµ
;αβ we again mean second derivative. Many authors
instead write Aµ
,αβ ≡Aµ
,α,β or Aµ
;αβ ≡Aµ
;α;β. We shall use either notation.
In general it turns out that even though Aµ
,αβ = Aµ
,βα, however in general
it is true that Aµ
;αβ ̸= Aµ
;βα. Let us examine this in more detail. Firstly
consider the second derivative of a scalar φ. A scalar does not change under
parallel transport therefore φ;µ = φ,µ. From (3.63) we have (φ;µ is a tensor,
not a scalar)
φ;µ;ν = φ,µ;ν = φ,µ,ν −Γϵ
µνφ,ϵ
(3.83)
but because Γϵ
µν = Γϵ
νµ it follows that φ;µν = φ;νµ meaning that the order
of diﬀerentiation does not matter for a scalar. Consider now a vector. Let’s
diﬀerentiate equation (3.64). Note that Aµ
;ν is a second rank tensor, so we
use (3.67) as follows
Aµ
;ν;λ = Aµ
;ν,λ + Γµ
λϵAϵ
;ν −Γϵ
νλAµ
;ϵ
=
∂
∂xλ (Aµ
;ν) + Γµ

,ν,λ + Γµ
νϵ,λAϵ + Γµ
νϵAϵ
,λ + Γµ
λϵAϵ
;ν −Γϵ
νλAµ
;ϵ
(3.84)
Now interchange the order of diﬀerentiation (just swap the ν and λ indices)
Aµ
;λ;ν = Aµ
,λ,ν + Γµ
λϵ,νAϵ + Γµ
λϵAϵ
,ν + Γµ
νϵAϵ
;λ −Γϵ
λνAµ
;ϵ
(3.85)
Subtracting we have
Aµ

The Riemann tensor tells us everything essential about the curvature of
a space. For a Cartesian spcae the Riemann tensor is zero.
The Riemann tensor has the following useful symmetry properties [9]
Rα
βγδ = −Rα
βδγ
(3.88)
Rα
βγδ + Rα
γδβ + Rα
δβγ = 0
(3.89)
and
Rαβγδ = −Rβαγδ
(3.90)
All other symmetry properties of the Riemann tensor may be obtained from
these. For example
Rαβγδ = Rγδαβ
(3.91)
Finally we introduce the Ricci tensor [9] by contracting on a pair of indices
Rαβ ≡Rϵ
αϵβ
(3.92)
which has the property
Rαβ = Rβα
(3.93)
(It will turn out later that Rαβ = 0 for empty space [9] ). Note that the
contraction of the Riemann tensor is unique up to a sign, i.e. we could have
deﬁned Rϵ
ϵαβ or Rϵ
αϵβ or Rϵ
αβϵ as the Ricci tensor and we would have the
same result except that maybe a sign diﬀernce would appear. Thus diﬀerent
books may have this sign diﬀerence.
However all authors agree on the deﬁnition of the Riemann scalar (ob-
tained by contracting Rα
β)
R ≡Rα
α ≡gαβRαβ
(3.94)
Finally the Einstein tensor is deﬁned as
Gµν ≡Rµν −1
2Rgµν
(3.95)
After discussing the stress-energy tensor in the next chapter, we shall put
all of this tensor machinery to use in our discussion of general relativity
following.

ENERGY-MOMENTUM
TENSOR
It is important to emphasize that our discussion in this chapter is based
entirely on Special Relativity.
4.1
Euler-Lagrange and Hamilton’s Equations
Newton’s second law of motion is
F = dp
dt
(4.1)
or in component form (for each component Fi)
Fi = dpi
dt
(4.2)
where pi = m ˙qi (with qi being the generalized position coordinate) so that
dpi
dt = ˙m ˙qi + m¨qi. If ˙m = 0 then Fi = m¨qi = mai. For conservative forces
F = −▽V where V is the scalar potential. Rewriting Newton’s law we have
−dV
dqi
= d
dt(m ˙qi)
(4.3)
Let us deﬁne the Lagrangian L(qi, ˙qi) ≡T −V where T is the kinetic energy.
In freshman physics T = T( ˙qi) = 1
2m ˙q2
i and V = V (qi) such as the harmonic
oscillator V (qi) = 1
2kq2
i . That is in freshman physics T is a function only
of velocity ˙qi and V is a function only of position qi.
Thus L(qi, ˙qi) =
45

46
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
T( ˙qi) −V (qi). It follows that ∂L
∂qi = −dV
dqi and ∂L
∂˙qi = dT
d ˙qi = m ˙qi = pi. Thus
Newton’s law is
Fi = dpi
dt
∂L
∂qi
= d
dt(∂L
∂˙qi
)
(4.4)
with the canonical momentum [1] deﬁned as
pi ≡∂L
∂˙qi
(4.5)
The second equation of (4.4) is known as the Euler-Lagrange equations of
motion and serves as an alternative formulation of mechanics [1]. It is usually
written
d
dt(∂L
∂˙qi
) −∂L
∂qi
= 0
(4.6)
or just
˙pi = ∂L
∂qi
(4.7)
We have obtained the Euler-Lagrange equations using simple arguments. A
more rigorous derivation is based on the calculus of variations [1] as discussed
in Section 7.3.
We now introduce the Hamiltonian H deﬁned as a function of p and q as
H(pi, qi) ≡pi ˙qi −L(qi, ˙qi)
(4.8)
For the simple case T = 1
2m ˙q2
i and V ̸= V ( ˙qi) we have pi ∂L
∂˙qi = m ˙qi so that
T = p2
i
2m and pi ˙qi = p2
i
m so that H(pi, qi) = p2
i
2m + V (qi) = T + V which is the
total energy. Hamilton’s equations of motion immediately follow from (4.8)
as
∂H
∂pi
= ˙qi
(4.9)
because L ̸= L(pi) and ∂H
∂qi = −∂L
∂qi so that from (4.4)
−∂H
∂qi
= ˙pi.
(4.10)

4.2. CLASSICAL FIELD THEORY
47
4.2
Classical Field Theory
Scalar ﬁelds are important in cosmology as they are thought to drive inﬂa-
tion. Such a ﬁeld is called an inﬂaton, an example of which may be the Higgs
boson. Thus the ﬁeld φ considered below can be thoguht of as an inﬂaton,
a Higgs boson or any other scalar boson.
In both special and general relativity we always seek covariant equations
in which space and time are given equal status. The Euler-Lagrange equa-
tions (4.6) are clearly not covariant because special emphasis is placed on
time via the ˙qi and d
dt( ∂L
∂˙qi ) terms.
Let us replace the qi by a ﬁeld φ ≡φ(x) where x ≡(t, x). The generalized
coordiante q has been replaced by the ﬁeld variable φ and the discrete index
i has been replaced by a continuously varying index x. In the next section
we shall show how to derive the Euler-Lagrange equations from the action
deﬁned as
S ≡
Z
Ldt
(4.11)
which again is clearly not covariant. A covariant form of the action would
involve a Lagrangian density L via
S ≡
Z
Ld4x =
Z
Ld3xdt
(4.12)
with L ≡
R Ld3x. The term −∂L
∂qi in equation (4.6) gets replaced by the
covariant term −
∂L
∂φ(x).
Any time derivative
d
dt should be replaced with
∂µ ≡
∂
∂xµ which contains space as well as time derivatives. Thus one can
guess that the covariant generalization of the point particle Euler-Lagrange
equations (4.6) is
∂µ
∂L
∂(∂µφ) −∂L
∂φ = 0
(4.13)
which is the covariant Euler-Lagrange equation for scalar ﬁelds. This will
be derived rigorously in the next section.
In analogy with the canonical momentum in equation (4.5) we deﬁne the
covariant momentum density
Πµ ≡
∂L
∂(∂µφ)
(4.14)
so that the Euler-Lagrange equations become
∂µΠµ = ∂L
∂φ
(4.15)

48
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
The canonical momentum is deﬁned as
Π ≡Π0 = ∂L
∂˙φ
(4.16)
The energy momentum tensor is (analagous to (4.8))
Tµν ≡Πµ∂νφ −gµνL
(4.17)
with the Hamiltonian density
H ≡
Z
Hd3x
H ≡T00 = Π ˙φ −L
(4.18)
4.2.1
Classical Klein-Gordon Field
In order to illustrate the foregoing theory we shall use the example of the
classical, massive Klein-Gordon ﬁeld deﬁned with the Lagrangian density
(HL units ??)
LKG = 1
2(∂µφ∂µφ −m2φ2)
= 1
2[ ˙φ2 −(▽φ)2 −m2φ2]
(4.19)
The covariant momentum density is more easily evaluated by re-writing
LKG = 1
2gµν(∂µφ∂νφ −m2φ2). Thus Πµ =
∂L
∂(∂µφ) = 1
2gµν(δα
µ∂νφ + ∂µφδα
ν )
= 1
2(δα
µ∂µφ + ∂νφδα
ν ) = 1
2(∂αφ + ∂αφ) = ∂αφ. Thus for the Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld we have
Πα = ∂αφ
(4.20)
giving the canonical momentum Π = Π0 = ∂0φ = ∂0φ = ˙φ,
Π = ˙φ
(4.21)
Evaluating ∂L
∂φ = −m2φ, the Euler-Lagrange equations give the ﬁeld equation
as ∂µ∂µφ + m2φ or
(22 + m2)φ = 0
¨φ −▽2φ + m2φ = 0
(4.22)

4.3. PRINCIPLE OF LEAST ACTION
49
which is the Klein-Gordon equation for a free, massive scalar ﬁeld. In mo-
mentum space p2 = −22, thus
(p2 −m2)φ = 0
(4.23)
(Note that some authors [30] deﬁne 22 ≡▽2 −∂2
∂t2 diﬀerent from (3.42), so
that they write the Klein-Gordon equation as (22−m2)φ = 0 or (p2+m2)φ =
0.)
The energy momentum tensor is
Tµν ≡Πµ∂νφ −gµνL
= ∂µφ∂νφ −gµνL
= ∂µφ∂νφ −1
2gµν(∂αφ∂αφ −m2φ2).
(4.24)
Therefore the Hamiltonian density is H ≡T00 = ˙φ2 −1
2(∂αφ∂αφ −m2φ2)
which becomes [31]
H = 1
2
˙φ2 + 1
2(▽φ)2 + 1
2m2φ2
= 1
2[Π2 + (▽φ)2 + m2φ2]

where we have relied upon the results of Section 3.4.1.

Energy-Momentum Tensor for Perfect Fluid
The best references for this section are [9](Pg. 124-125), [7], and [32](Pg.
155). The book by D’Inverno [32] also has a nice discussion of the Navier-
Stokes equation and its relation to the material of this section. Other ref-
erences are [8](Pg.
83), [15](Pg.
330), [33](Pg.
259), [34](Pg.
38), and
[2].
These references show that the energy-momentum tensor for a perfect
ﬂuid is

50
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
T µν = (ρ + p)uµuν −pηµν
(4.26)
where ρ is the energy density and p is the pressure. We shall now work this
out for several speciﬁc cases [9]. Fig. 2.5 of Narlikar’s book [7] is particularly
helpful.
Motionless dust represents a collection of particles at rest. Thus uµ =
(c, 0), so that T 00 = ρ. The equation of state for dust is p = 0 so that
T ii = 0 = T 0i = T ij. Thus
T µν =





ρ



(4.27)
Motionless ﬂuid representes a collection of particles all moving randomly
(such that they exert a pressure) but the whole collection is at rest, such
as a gas of particles at non-zero temperature, but conﬁned in a motionless
container. In this case uµ = (c, 0) again, but now p ̸= 0. Thus again T 00 = ρ
but now T ii = p and T ij = 0 so that
T µν =








(4.28)
Motionless radiation is characterized by the equation of state p = 1
3ρ.
Again the radiation is conﬁned to a container not in motion so that uµ =
(γc, 0). (The 1
3 just comes from randomizing the pressure in 3 dimensions
[7].) Thus
T µν = 4
3ρuµuν −1
3ρηµν

(4.29)
Thus the general case is the motionless ﬂuid energy-momentum tensor
in equation (4.28). The special cases of motionless dust or motionless radi-
ation are obtained with the respective substitutions of p = 0 or p = 1
3ρ in
equation (4.28).

4.5. CONTINUITY EQUATION
51
4.5
Continuity Equation
In classical electrodynamics the fourcurrent density is jµ ≡(cρ, j) and the
covariant conservation law is ∂µjµ = 0 which results in the equation of
continuity
∂ρ
∂t + ▽.j = 0.
This can also be obtained from the Maxwell
equations by taking the divergence of Amp`ere’s law. (do Problems 4.1
and 4.2) Thus the four Maxwell equations are entirely equivalent to only
three Maxwell equations plus the equation of continuity.
We had a similar situation in Chapters 1 and 2 where we found that the
velocity and acceleration equations imply the conservation equation. Thus
the two velocity and acceleration equations are entirely equivalent to only
the velocity equation plus the conservation law.
In analogy with electrodynamics the conservation law for the energy-
momentum tensor is
T µν
;ν = 0
(4.30)
In the next chapter we shall show how equation (2.1) can be derived from
this.
4.6
Interacting Scalar Field
We represent the interaction of a scalar ﬁeld with a scalar potential V (φ).
Recall our elementary results for L = T −V = 1
2m ˙q2
i −V (qi) for the coordi-
nates ˙qi. These discrete coordinates ˙qi have now been replaced by continuous
ﬁeld variables φ(x) where φ has replaced the generalized coordinate q and
the discrete index i has been replaced by a continuous index x. Thus V (qi)
naturally gets replaced with V (φ) where φ ≡φ(x).
Thus for an interacting scalar ﬁeld we simply tack on −V (φ) to the free
Klein-Gordon Lagrangian of equation (4.19) to give
L = 1
2(∂µφ∂µφ −m2φ2) −V (φ)
≡LO + LI
(4.31)
where LO ≡LKG and LI ≡−V (φ).
Actually the Lagrangian of (4.31)
refers to a minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld as opposed to conformally coupled
[21] (Pg. 276). It is important to emphasize that V (φ) does not contain
derivative terms such as ∂µφ. Thus the covariant momentum density and
canonical momentum remain the same as equations (4.20) and (4.21) for the

52
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
free particle case namely Πα = ∂αφ and π = ˙φ. Solving the Euler-Lagrange
equations now gives
(22 + m2)φ + V ′ = 0
¨φ −▽2φ + m2φ + V ′ = 0
(4.32)
with
V ′ ≡dV
dφ
(4.33)
The energy-momentum tensor is the same as for the free particle case,
equation (4.24), except for the addition of gµνV (φ) as in
Tµν = ∂µφ∂νφ −gµν[1
2(∂αφ∂αφ −m2φ2) −V (φ)]
(4.34)
yielding the Hamiltonian density the same as for the free particle case, equa-
tion (4.25), except for the addition of V (φ) as in
H ≡T00 = 1
2
˙φ2 + 1
2(▽φ)2 + 1
2m2φ2 + V (φ)
= 1
2[Π2 + (▽φ)2 + m2φ2] + V (φ).
(4.35)
The purely spatial components are Tii = ∂iφ∂iφ−gii[1
2(∂αφ∂αφ−m2φ2)−
V (φ)] and with gii = −1 (i.e. assume Special Relativity NNN) we obtain
Tii = 1
2
˙φ2 + 1
2(▽φ)2 −1
2m2φ2 −V (φ)
(4.36)
Note that even though Tii has repeated indices let us not assume P
i is
implied in this case. That is Tii refers to Tii = T11 = T22 = T33 and not
Tii = T11 + T22 + T33. Some authors (e.g Serot and Walecka [34]) do assume
the latter convention and therefore will disagree with our results by 1
3.
Let us assume that the eﬀects of the scalar ﬁeld are averaged so as
to behave like a perfect (motionless) ﬂuid. In that case, comparing equa-
tion (4.28), we make the identiﬁcation [13, 34]
E ≡ρ ≡< T00 >
(4.37)
and
p ≡< Tii >
(4.38)

4.7. COSMOLOGY WITH THE SCALAR FIELD
53
where E ≡ρ is the energy density and p is the pressure. (Note that because
Serot and Walecka do assume the Einstein summation convention for Tii,
they actually write p ≡1
3 < Tii >.) Making these identiﬁcations we have
ρ = 1

(4.39)
and
p = 1
2
˙φ2 + 1
2(▽φ)2 −1
2m2φ2 −V (φ)
(4.40)
Let us also assume that the scalar ﬁeld is massless and that φ = φ(t)
only, i.e. φ ̸= φ(x), so that spatial derivatives disappear. (See Pg. 276-277
of Kolb and Turner [21] and Pg. 138 of Islam [13]). Therefore we ﬁnally
obtain [13, 21].
ρ = 1

(4.41)
and
p = 1

(4.42)

Cosmology with the Scalar Field
We have ﬁnished with our discussion of the energy-momentum tensor and
therefore we should now move onto the next chapter. However, with the
tools at hand (energy-momentum tensor and Friedmann equations) we can
discuss the relevance of the scalar ﬁeld to cosmology without needing the
formalism of General Relativity. Therefore before proceeding to the next
chapter we shall make a brief digression and discuss the evolution of the
scalar ﬁeld.
If one is considering cosmological evolution driven by a scalar ﬁeld, one
can simply substitute the above expressions for ρ and p into the Friedmann

54
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
and acceleration equations (1.29) and (1.30) to obtain the time evolution of
the scale factor as in
H2 ≡(

3
[1
2
˙φ2 + 1
2(▽φ)2 −1
2m2φ2 −V (φ)] + Λ
3
(4.44)
The equation for the time evolution of the scalar ﬁeld is obtained either by
taking the time derivative of equation (4.43) or more simply by substituting
the expression for ρ and p in equations (4.41) and (4.42) into the conservation
equation (2.1) to give
¨φ + 3H[ ˙φ + (▽φ)2
˙φ
] + m2φ + V ′ = 0.
(4.45)
Note that this is a new Klein-Gordon equation quite diﬀerent to equation (4.32).
The diﬀerence occurs because we have now incorporated gravity via the
Friedmann and conservation equation. We shall derive this equation again
in Chapter 7.
Again assuming the ﬁeld is massless and ignoring spatial derivatives we
have
¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V ′ = 0
(4.46)
Notice that this is the equation for a damped harmonic oscillator (V = 1
2kx2
and dV
dx ≡V ′ = kx with F = −V ′) as
m¨x + d ˙x + kx = 0
(4.47)
Kolb and Turner [21] actually also include a particle creation term due to
the decay of the scalar ﬁeld, which will cause reheating, and instead write
¨φ + 3H ˙φ + Γ ˙φ + V ′ = 0
(4.48)

4.7. COSMOLOGY WITH THE SCALAR FIELD
55
4.7.1
Alternative derivation
We can derive the equation of motion (4.46) for the scalar ﬁeld in a quicker
manner [29] (Pg. 73), but this derivation only seems to work if we set m = 0
and ▽φ = 0 at the beginning. (Exercise: ﬁnd out what goes wrong if m ̸= 0
and ▽φ ̸= 0.)
Consider a Lagrangian for φ which already has the scale factor built into
it as
L = R3[1
2(∂µφ∂µφ −m2φ2) −V (φ)]
(4.49)
The R3 factor comes from √−g = R3 for a Robertson-Walker metric. This
will be discussed in Chapter 7.
Notice that it is the same factor which
sits outside the Friedmann Lagrangian in equation (2.20). The equation of
motion is (do Problem 4.3)
¨φ −▽2φ + 3H ˙φ + m2φ + V ′ = 0
(4.50)
which is diﬀerent to (4.45). (NNNN why ???) However if m = 0 and ▽φ = 0
it is the same as (4.46).
Let’s only consider
L = R3[1
2
˙φ2 −V (φ)]
(4.51)
which results from setting m = 0 and ▽φ = 0 in (4.49). The equation of
motion is
¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V ′ = 0
(4.52)
Notice how quickly we obtained this result rather than the long procedure
to get (4.46). We didn’t even use the energy-momentum tensor. Also realize
that because ▽φ = 0 the above Lagrangian formalism is really no diﬀerent to
our old fashioned formalism where we had qi(t). Here we have only φ = φ(t)
(not φ = φ(x)), and so we only have i = 1, i.e. qi ≡φ.
Identifying the Lagrangian as [29] L = R3(T −V ) we immediately write
down the total energy density ρ = T + V = 1
2 ˙φ2 + V (φ). Taking the time
derivative ˙ρ = ˙φ¨φ + V ′ ˙φ = −3H ˙φ2 from (4.46) and substituting into the
conservation equation (2.1), ˙ρ = −3H(ρ + p) we obtain the pressure as
p = 1
2 ˙φ2 −V (φ). Thus our energy density and pressure derived here agree
with our results above (4.39) and (4.40). Notice that the pressure is nothing
more than p =
L
R3 . [29].

CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
4.7.2
Limiting solutions
Assuming that k = Λ = 0 the Friedmann equation becomes
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
(1
2
˙φ + V )
(4.53)
This equation together with equation (4.46) form a set of coupled equations
where solutions give φ(t) and R(t). We solve the coupled equations in the
standard way by ﬁrst eliminating one variable, then solving one equation,
then substituting the solution back into the other equation to solve for the
other variable. Let’s write equation (4.46) purely in terms of φ by eliminating
R which appears in the form H =
˙R
R. We eliminate R by substituting H
from (4.53) into (4.46) to give
¨φ +
q
12πG( ˙φ2 + 2V ) ˙φ+V’=0
¨φ2 + 2¨φV ′ −12πG( ˙φ2 + 2V ) ˙φ2 + V ′2 = 0
(4.54)
Notice that this is a non-linear diﬀerential equation for φ, which is diﬃcult
to solve in general. In this section we shall study the solutions for certain
limiting cases. Once φ(t) is obtained from (4.54) it is put back into (4.53)
to get R(t).
Potential Energy=0
Setting V = 0 we then have ρ = 1
2 ˙φ2 = p. Thus our equation of state is
p = ρ
(4.55)
or γ = 3.
With V = V ′ = 0 we have
¨φ2 +
√
12πG ˙φ2 = 0
(4.56)
which has the solution (do problem 4.4)
φ(t) = φo +

√
12πG
ln[1 +
√
12πG ˙φ(t −to)]
(4.57)

4.7. COSMOLOGY WITH THE SCALAR FIELD
57
(Note that the solution is equation (9.18) of [29] is wrong.) Upon substitut-
ing this solution back into the Friedmann equation (4.53) and solving the
diﬀerential equation we obtain (do problem 4.5)
R(t) = Ro[1 +
√
12πG ˙φo(t −to)]1/3.
(4.58)
This result may be understood from another point of view.
Writing the
Friedmann equations as
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
ρ
(4.59)
and
ρ =
α
Rm
(4.60)
then the solution is always
R∝t2/m
(4.61)
which always gives
ρ ∝1
t2 .
(4.62)
If
ρ = constant
(4.63)
(corresponding to m = 0) then the solution is
R∝et
(4.64)
(do problem 4.6). Note that for m < 2, one obtains power law inﬂation.
For ordinary matter (m = 3), or radiation (m = 4) we have R ∝t2/3 and
R ∝t1/2 respectively. Returning to the scalar ﬁeld solution (4.57) the density
is ρ = 1
2 ˙φ2 for V = 0. Thus
˙φ(t) =
˙φo
1 +
√
12πG ˙φo(t −to)
(4.65)
combined with ( R
Ro )3 = 1 +
√
12πG ˙φo(t −to) from (4.58) yields
˙φ(t) =
˙φoR3

R3
(4.66)
to give the density

58
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
ρ = 1

˙φ2
oR6
o
R6
(4.67)
corresponding to m = 6 and thus R ∝t1/3 in agreement with (4.58). Note
also that this density ρ ∝
1
R6 also gives ρ ∝1
t2 .
Thus for a scalar ﬁeld with V = 0, we have p = ρ (γ = 3) and ρ ∝
1
R6 .
Contrast this with matter for which p = 0(γ = 0) and ρ ∝
1
R3 or radiation
for which p = 1
3ρ (γ = 1/3) and ρ ∝
1
R4 .
However equation (4.67) may not be interpreted as a decaying Cosmo-
logical Constant because p ̸= ρ (see later).
Kinetic Energy=0
Here we take ˙φ = ¨φ = 0, so that ρ = V and p = −V giving
p = −ρ
(4.68)
or γ = −3 which is a negative pressure equation of state. Our equation of
motion for the scalar ﬁeld (4.54) becomes
V ′ = 0
(4.69)
meaning that
V = Vo
(4.70)
which is constant. Substituting the solution into the Friedmann equation
(4.53) gives
H2 = (
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
Vo
(4.71)
which acts as a Cosmological Constant and which has the solution (do prob-
lem 4.7)
R(t) = Roe
p
8πG
3 Vo(t−to)
(4.72)
which is an inﬂationary solution, valid for any V .
Warning
We have found that if k = Λ = 0 and if ρ ∝
1
Rm then R∝t2 for any
value of m. All of this is correct. To check this we might substitute into the
Friedmann equation as
H2 = (
˙R
R)2 ∝1
t2
(4.73)

4.7. COSMOLOGY WITH THE SCALAR FIELD
59
and say
˙R
R ∝1
t giving
R 1
R
dR
dt dt ∝
R dt
t which yields ln R ∝lnt and thus
R ∝t2/m. The result R ∝t is wrong because we have left out an important
constant.
Actually if
˙R
R = c
t then ln R = c ln t = ln tc giving R ∝tc instead of R∝t.
Let’s keep our constants then. Write ρ =
d2
Rm then R = (md
2 )2/mt2/m
and ρ =
d2
( md
2 )2t2 = (2/m)2
t2
. Substituting into the Friedmann equation gives
( ˙R
R)2 =
(2/m)2
t2
or
˙R
R =
(2/m)
t
with the above constant C =
2
m yielding
R ∝t2/m in agreement with the correct result above.
The lesson is be careful of constants when doing back-of-the-envelope
calculations.
4.7.3
Exactly Solvable Model of Inﬂation
Because (4.54) is a diﬃcult non-linear equation, exactly solvable models are
very rare. We shall examine the model of Barrow [35] which can be solved
exactly and leads to power law inﬂation. The advantage of an exactly solv-
able model is that one can develop ones physical intuition better. Barrow’s
model [35] is brieﬂy introduced by Islam [13].
Any scalar ﬁeld model is speciﬁed by writing down the potential V (φ).
Barrow’s potential is
V (φ) ≡βe−λφ
(4.74)
where β and λ are constants to be determined. Barrow [35] claims that a
particular solution to (4.54) is (which was presumably guessed at, rather
then solving the diﬀerential equation)
φ(t) =
√
2Alnt
(4.75)
where
√
2A is just some constant. We check this claim by substituting (4.74)
and (4.75) into (4.54). From this we ﬁnd (do problem 4.9) that
λ =
r 2
A
(4.76)
and
β = −A
(4.77)
or
β = A(24πGA −1)
(4.78)

60
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
Note that Barrow is wrong when he writes λA =
√
2. Also he uses units
with 8πG = 1, so that the second solution (4.78), he writes correctly as
β = A(3A −1). Also Barrow doesn’t use the ﬁrst solution (4.77) for reasons
we shall see shortly.
Having solved for φ(t) we now substitute into (4.53) to solve for R(t).
(Recall φ(t) and R(t) are the solutions we seek to our coupled equations
(4.46) and (4.53).)
Substituting V =
Λ
t2 and ˙φ =
√
2A
t
(see solution to
problem 4.9) we have
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
(1
2
2A
t2 + β
t2 ) = 8πG
3
(A + β) 1
t2
(4.79)
giving an equivalent density
ρ = A + β
t2
(4.80)
Clearly we see why we reject the ﬁrst solution (4.77) with β = −A. It would
give zero density. Using the second solution (4.78) with β = A(24πGA −1)
yields
ρ = 24πGA2
t2
.
(4.81)
Solving the Friedmann equation (4.79) gives
R∝t8πGA
(4.82)
where D is some constant. Setting 8πG ≡1 we have
R∝tA
(4.83)
in agreement with Barrow’s solution. Power law inﬂation results for
A > 1.
(4.84)
Inverting the solution (4.83) we have t2 = C′R2/A where C′ is some constant.
Substituting into (4.81) we have
ρ ∝
1
R2/A
(4.85)
which corresponds to a Weak decaying Cosmological Constant. (See sections
4.7.4 and 4.7.5) For the inﬂationary result A > 1 we have 2
A ≡m < 2 which
corresponds to the quantum tunneling solution!!
Note of course that (4.85) can also be obtained via ρ = 1
3 ˙φ2+V. We have
V= β
t2 ∝
1
R2/A and ˙φ =
√
2A
t
giving ˙φ2 ∝
1
R2/A .

4.7. COSMOLOGY WITH THE SCALAR FIELD
61
4.7.4
Variable Cosmological Constant
In this section we address the question as to when the density can be inter-
preted as a Cosmological Constant. Recall the Friedmann equations
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
ρ −k
R2 + Λ
3
(4.86)
and
¨R
R
=
−4πG
3
(ρ + 3p) + Λ
3
=
−4πG
3
ρ(1 + γ) + Λ
3
(4.87)
for p = γ
3ρ. Suppose ρ = k = 0, then we have
H2 = (
˙R
R)2 = Λ
3
(4.88)
and
¨R
R = Λ
3
(4.89)
where two things have happened. Firstly the velocity and acceleration equa-
tions both have the same right hand side. Secondly the acceleration is posi-
tive. What sort of density would give the same result. Again for k = 0
H2 = (
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
ρ
(4.90)
and
¨R
R = 8πG
3
ρ
(4.91)
only for γ = −3 or p = −ρ. From our conservation equation, ˙ρ = −3H(ρ+p),
this can only happen for ρ=constant. Thus constant density with equation
of state p = −ρ acts identically to a Cosmological Constant. In addition
the solution is automatically are of exponential inﬂation, R ∝eHt. (Ex-
ercise:verify this.) Let us deﬁne a Strong Cosmological Constant as one in
which the velocity and acceleration equations both have the same right hand
side, (which automatically implies that the acceleration is positive). Such a
Strong Cosmological Constant must be a true constant.

62
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
On the other hand we can imagine densities that still give a positive
acceleration (i.e. inﬂation) but do not normally give the velocity and accel-
eration with the same right hand side. Examining (4.54) indicates that the
acceleration is guarenteed to be positive if γ < −1 giving p < −1
3ρ. (Recall
that the exponential inﬂation above required γ = −3, which is consistent
with the inequality.) Thus negative pressure gives inﬂation. (Although not
all negative pressure gives inﬂation, e.g. p = −1
4ρ.) The inﬂation due to
γ < −1 will not be exponential inﬂation, but something weaker like per-
haps power law inﬂation. Let us deﬁne a Weak Cosmological Constant as
one which arises from negative pressure (actually p < −1
3ρ) to give a positive
acceleration (inﬂation) only. The velocity and acceleration equations need
not have the same right hand side.
Recall that ordinary matter and radiation, or any positive pressure equa-
tion of state, neccesarily leads to negative acceleration (with Λ = 0). Thus
positive pressure leads to attractive gravity. However positive acceleration
implies a repulsive gravity or antigravity. Thus negative pressure (actually
p < −1
3ρ) leads to antigravity. This is why we wish to use the term weak Cos-
mological Constant (even though right hand sides are not the same) because
it is consonant with antigravity.
Let us summarize. We consider ρ alone with Λ ≡0. For
¨R
>
0 ⇒γ < −1 and ρ =anything (e.g. ρ = ρ(R) or ρ =constant)
¨R
>
0 and ρ =constant ⇒γ = −3
For γ < −1, ρ behaves as a weak Cosmological Constant and for γ = −3,
ρ behaves as a Strong Cosmological Constant.
Finally let us emphasize that it is perfectly legitimate to consider a Weak
Cosmological Constant as a real Cosmological Constant. Einstein’s original
motivation in introducing Λ was to obtain a static universe. Thus all he
wanted was a antigravity term; i.e. all he wanted was a weak Cosmological
Constant. It “accidentally” happened that the right hand sides turned out
to be equal, giving a strong Λ.
Interpreting ρ as a Cosmological Constant leads us to expect that a
weak Cosmological Constant can vary. This follows from ρ=anything above.
i.e.
ρ=constant or ρ = ρ(R) giving a variable function.
(But a strong
Cosmological Constant cannot vary).

4.7. COSMOLOGY WITH THE SCALAR FIELD
63
4.7.5
Cosmological constant and Scalar Fields
Refer back to the density and pressure of the scalar ﬁeld in equations (4.41))
and (4.42). We had
ρ = 1
2
˙φ2 + V (φ)
and
ρ = 1
2
˙φ2 −V (φ).
For the case where PE = V = 0 we have p = ρ. The pressure is positive
and therefore equation (4.67), ρ ∝
1
R6 , cannot be interpreted as a (variable)
Cosmological Constant.
For the case where KE = 1
2 ˙φ2 = 0 we have p = −ρ meaning that ρ can
be interpreted as a Strong Cosmological Constant. (We found V ′ = 0 and
thus ρ = V = constant = Vo and p = −Vo.)
These results are true in general (assuming m = ∇φ = 0) as we have not
yet speciﬁed V (φ).
Let us now consider the Barrow model V (φ) = βe−λφ. we found that
φ(t) = 2
λ ln t and β =
2
λ2 ( 6
λ2 −1) for 8πG ≡1. Introducing A ≡2
λ we can
re-write as β = A(3A −1) and φ(t) =
√
2A ln t and V (φ) = A(3A −1)eφ 2
A .
Substituting we obtain
ρBarrow = 3A2
t2
(4.92)
and
ρBarrow = 3A2
t2 (2A
3 −1) = (2A
3 −1)ρ
(4.93)
the general equation of state is p = γ
3ρ giving the Barrow equation of state
γBarrow = 2
A −3
(4.94)
in equation (4.84) we concluded that power law inﬂation results for A > 1.
Substituting this into (4.94) implies
γBarrow < −3
(4.95)
which we expect because power law inﬂation implies ¨R > 0. thus for A > 1
the Barrow pressure is negative with γ < −1 and thus ρBarrow = 3A2
t2
cor-
responds to a Weak Cosmological Constant. Furthermore this Cosmological
Constant is variable and decays with time. in equation (4.85) we wrote this
as ρBarrow ∝
1
R2/A .

64
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
4.7.6
Clariﬁcation
We wish to clarify the distinction between a Strong Cosmological Constant,
a Weak Cosmological Constant and a Varying Cosmological Constant. A
Strong Cosmological Constant occurs when the Friedmann equation are of
the form
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = Λ
3
(4.96)
and
−qH2 ≡
¨R
R = Λ
3
(4.97)
and comparing with
(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
ρ
(4.98)
¨R
R = −8πG
3
(ρ + 3p)
(4.99)
leads us to conclude that the equation of state for a Strong Cosmological
Constant is p = −ρ, where we have identiﬁed Λ ≡8πGρv. The conservation
equation
˙ρ = −3H(ρ + p)
(4.100)
leads us to conclude that Λ ≡8πGρv=constant for a Strong Cosmological
Constant.
A Variable Cosmological Constant Λ(R), can also be considered but the
equation cannot be like (4.96) and (4.97) with no ρ term. As we shall see be-
low a Varying Cosmological Constant automatically involves matter creation
(existence of a ρ term). Thus Λ(R) cannot be written down in the Friedmann
equation without also writing ρ. Thus for a Varying Cosmological Constant
(let k = 0) we have
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG

ρ + Λ(R)

(4.101)
and

The last equation show clearly that if ρv ̸= 0 (i.e.
ρv ̸= constant) then
matter or radiation is created or destroyed. This is why we cannot write
(4.96) and (4.97) if Λ is allowed to vary. We must include particle creation
terms as in (??) and (4.102).
For a Variable Cosmological Constant the same term Λ(R)
3
appears in
both right hand sides of the Friedmann equation (4.101) and (4.102). How-
ever we don’t know its equation of state. Also γ can be anything and thus
˙ρv can lead to creation of matter, radiation or anything else. Further Λ(R)
can vary.
Both a Strong and Weak Cosmological Constant have well deﬁned equa-
tion of state, both with (diﬀerent) negative pressure. A Weak Cosmological
Constant can vary but the right hand sides of the Friedmann equations diﬀer.
Thus we see that we have 3 diﬀerent types of Cosmological Constant
namely, Strong, Weak, and Variable, each with both similar and dissimiliar
properties. These are summarize in the Table.
4.7.7
Generic Inﬂation and Slow-Roll Approximation
We shall ﬁrst discuss features that are common to many models of inﬂation
based on scalar ﬁelds [21]. These models typically have a large region of the
potential where the potential is ﬂat (slow-roll region) and then a harmonic

region where the potential looks similar to an oscillatior (rapid oscillation
region). Such a potential is shown in Fig 4.1.
Let us ﬁrst analyze this situation from a simple physics point of view. If
Fig 4.1 were actually a plot of V (x) versus x the equation of motion would
be
m¨x + b ˙x + V ′ = 0
(4.109)
which, for V = 1
2kx2 or V ′ = kx would represent a damped harmonic oscil-
lator, which indeed is the case in the rapid oscillation region. In the slow
roll regime we have V ≈constant or V = Vo −Cx where C is small, giving
V ′ = −C. The physical situation would represent a ball rolling down a hill
with friction into a valley [21].
In the slow roll regime friction dominates and the ball moves at terminal
velocity [21], ˙x=constant and ˙x doesn’t change much so that ¨x = 0. This is
the slow roll regime we have
b ˙x + V ′ = 0
(4.110)
and for V = Vo −Cx we have
b ˙x≈C
(4.111)
When the ball ﬁnally reaches the valley we are back to the full equation
(4.109) where V ′ ≡kx so that the ball experiences rapid, damped oscilla-
tions.
Let’s return to the scalar ﬁeld equations which are (for Λ = k = 0)
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
(1

˙φ + V )
(4.112)

4.7. COSMOLOGY WITH THE SCALAR FIELD
67
and
¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V ′ = 0
(4.113)
where the friction term 3H is due to the expansion of the universe [21]. Based
on analogy with the rolling ball, the slow roll approximation ( ˙φ ≈constant,
¨φ ≈0) is
3H ˙φ + V ′ ≈0
(4.114)
In addition, the slow roll region is characterized by a small kinetic energy
1
2 ˙φ2 << V , so that
H2 ≈8πG
3
Vo ≈constant
(4.115)
For the rolling ball we only had one equation, but here we have two equations
(4.114) and (4.115) involved in the slow roll approximations. The slow roll
equation can also be obtained directly from equation (4.54) where we set
˙φ2 << 2Vo and ¨φ ≈0 to give
p
24πGVo ˙φ + V ′ = 0
(4.116)
which is consistent with combining (4.114) and (4.115). Normally we would
have the formula for V(φ) and solve (4.116) or (4.54) ﬁrst for φ(t) and then
substitute our answer into the Friedmann equation to obtain R(t). However
we have not yet speciﬁed V (φ). We have speciﬁed that we are in a slow roll
regime thus making (4.115) valid which we can solve directly for R(t) giving
an exponential inﬂationary solution
R(t)≈Roet
p
8πG
3 VO
(4.117)
Thus, no matter what V (φ) is, the slow regime always give approximately
exponential inﬂation.
To obtain φ(t) we must specify V (φ) even in the slow-roll regime.
4.7.8
Chaotic Inﬂation in Slow-Roll Approximation
The Chaotic inﬂation model is deﬁned by the potential
V (φ) = 1
2m2φ2
(4.118)
which is exactly analogous to the harmonic oscillator potential V (x) = 1
2kx2.

is the slow roll region in agreement with equation (9.25) of Madsen [29]. For
m << Mp or for short times we see that φ(t) will be approximately constant,
or slowing rolling. We see that φ(t) is a decaying exponential in time. Thus
there will be a “half-life” or “lifetime” associated with slow roll which we
deﬁne as
τ = φo
√
12π
mMp
(4.123)
When t = τ we see that φ = φo 1
e. That is the amplitude is reduced by the
factor 1
e We expect that the slow roll approximation will be valid for t < τ.
Our solution of φ(t) in (4.122) came from solving (4.116). We can also
obtain φ(t) slightly diﬀerently. Let’s not assume V = Vo=constant, but only
that ˙φ2 << 2V and ¨φ ≈0. Then instead of (4.116) we have
√
24πGV ˙φ + V ′ = 0
(4.124)
which, for chaotic inﬂation becomes

√
12πt
(4.127)
in agreement with (4.122) for short time.
We can further investigate the validity of the slow roll approximation by
evaluating the potential as a function of time and checking that it is constant
for short times. We do this by substituting our solution for φ(t) back into
the potential. We get
V

(4.128)
Thus we see that for m << Mp or for short times the potential is indeed
constant.
For short times (or for m << Mp) we have veriﬁed that φ and V are
approximately constant. This means that ˙φ ≈0 and ρ ≈Vo which give
exponential inﬂation. (Also p ≈−Vo, so that p = −ρ).
In order to solve the horizon, ﬂatness and monopole problems, most
models require a high degree of inﬂation typically amounting to about 60
e-folds [21]. Given R(t) = RoeHt, the number of e-folds after time t is
N = ln(R(t)
Ro
) = Ht.
(4.129)
(Actually a better formula is given in equation (8.26) of the book by Kolb
and Turner [21] (pg.278)). After one lifetime τ, the number of e-folds is

(4.131)

CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
Notice how the ﬂatness problem is solved in inﬂation. We have H2 ≡( ˙R
R)2 =
8πG
3 ρ −k
R2 ≈8πG
3 Vo −k
R2 . During inﬂation (slow roll) Vo stays constant but
by the end of inﬂation R = Roe60 or
1
R2 =
1
R2o e−120.
The term
k
R2 has
dropped by e−120, whereas Vo has remained constant. Thus the term
k
R2 is
entirely negligible. Inﬂation does not give k = 0, but rather gives
k
R2 ≈0
which is equivalent to k = 0. This is an improtant distinction. The universe
can have k = 0 or k = +1 or k = −1. No matter what the value of k, it gets
diluted by inﬂation and is equivalent to a universe with k = 0. thus within
our horizon the universe is ﬂat. Quantum cosmology predict that a universe
which arises via tunnelling must have k = +1. This is perfectly OK with
inﬂation which simply dilutes the curvature.
Quantum tunnelling requires k = +1. Inﬂation actually says nothing
about the value of k. It simply predicts that
k
R2 ≈0 at the end of inﬂation.
On Earth, the reason many people believe the Earth is ﬂat is because
we cannot see beyond the horizon. Up to the horizon it looks ﬂat. If we
could see beyond the horizon we would see the curvature. Similarly for our
universe. According to inﬂation the size of the universe is much larger then
the distance to the horizon ( i.e. as far as we can see) the universe looks
ﬂat becuase
k
R2 is negligible. If we could see beyond the horizon we would
see the curvature. And quantum tunnelling predicts that what we would see
would be a universe of positive curvature.
Cosmological Constant associated with Chaotic Inﬂation
Let us now calculate the density as a function of R. We solve (4.119) for
t = t(R) as
t =
r 3
4π
Mp
mφo
ln( R
Ro
).
(4.132)
Substituting into (4.122) we have
φ(R) = φo(Ro

M2p
4πφ2o
(4.133)
and with V (φ) = 1
2m2φ2 we have
V (R) = 1
2m2φ2
o(Ro

M2p
2πφ2o .
(4.134)
Also from (4.122)
˙φ(t) = −mMp

so that
˙φ(R) = −mMp
√
12π(Ro

M2p
4πφ2o .
(4.136)
Finally evaluating ρ = 1
2 ˙φ2 + V we have
ρ(R) = 1
2m2( M2

12π + φ2

M2p
2πφ2o .
(4.137)
Thus
ρ(R) ∝

Rm
where m ≡M2
p
2πφ2o
.
(4.138)
Recall previously that an inﬂationary solution requires m < 2, yielding
φo > Mp
√
4π = 0.3 Mp
(4.139)
which is entirely consistent with (4.131)!
What is the equation of state? using p = 1
2 ˙φ2 −V we obtain
p = 1
2m2( M2

o)(Ro

M2p
2πφ2o .
(4.140)
The question is, is the pressure negative? We ﬁnd that for inﬂation to occur
we need φo > Mp
√
4π. Write this as
φo = ℓMp
√
4π
with ℓ> 1
(4.141)
Thus the density becomes
ρ(R) = m2M2
p

(4.142)
and
p(R) = m2M2

(4.143)
Deﬁning κ ≡
m2M2

(Ro

3 + ℓ2)κ and p = (1
3 −ℓ2)κ, giving
p = 1−3ℓ2
1+3ℓ2 ρ. The requirement ℓ> 1 yields
p < −1
2ρ
(4.144)

72
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
which means negative pressure! Writing p = γ
3ρ gives
γ = −3
2.
(4.145)
These results are in agreement with our previous constraints that in order
to have positive ¨R (inﬂation) we needed p < 1
3ρ or γ < −1.
Our chaotic inﬂation model is the slow roll approximation gives negative
pressure (but not p = −ρ) and corresponds to a Weak Decaying Cosmological
Constant!
4.7.9
Density Fluctuations
An important result that we shall use without proof is that ﬂuctuations of
the scalar ﬁeld are given approximately by
δφ ≈H
2π
(4.146)
this result is discussed by Linde [36] (Pg.17,50), Kolb and Turner [21](Pg.284),
Collins, Martin and Squires [37] (Pg.410) and by Dolgov, Sazhin and Zel-
dovich [38].
Using ρ = 1
2 ˙φ2+V(φ) we have dρ
dφ = V ′(φ) or
δρ = V ′δφ≈V ′ H

(4.147)

(4.149)
This is an intensely important formula often written as

the density ﬂuctuations observed by COBE are δρ
ρ ≈10−5 yielding m =

The above formula is not very useful for the Barrow model where a well
deﬁned inﬂation means m ≡minflation is not present.
In that case the
formula is written more usefully as [?, ?, ?]

Equation of State for Variable Cosmological Constant
In this section we wish to demonstrate that Variable Cosmological Constant
models have negative pressure [?, ?, ?].
Firstly if one assumes
p ≡γ
3ρ
(4.152)
then the conservation law follows as
1
R3+γ
d
dR(ρR3+γ) = −ρ′
v.
(4.153)
Let’s assume that
ρv ≡
α
Rm = ρvo(Ro
R )m.
(4.154)
Integrating the conservation law we have
ρ =
A
R3+γ + χρv
(4.155)
where
χ ≡
m
3 + γ −m
(4.156)
and A is a constant give by
A = (ρo −χρvo)R3+γ
o
.
(4.157)
The pressure is
p = γ
3
A
R3+γ + γ
3
m
3 + γ −mρv
(4.158)
This looks like bad news. Assuming that ρv dominate over the ﬁrst term
at some stage of evolution, it looks like the pressure only get negative for
m> 3 + γ.
However, there are two things to keep in mind.
Firstly, the

74
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
pressure p is not the pressure of radiation or matter or vacuum because
ρ =
A
R3+γ +χρ, and p = γ
3ρ. The pressure that we would want to be negative
would be the vacuum pressure pv, which we shall work out below. Secondly,
the key point is not as much having p negative but rather having ¨R positive.
The equation
−qH2 ≡
¨R
R = −4πG
3
(ρ + 3p) + 8πG
3
ρv
(4.159)
can still give postive ¨R even if p is not negative, because the ρv term has to
be considered. The Friedmann equation is
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
(ρ + ρv) −k
R2
(4.160)
Let us evaluate the right hand sides of these two equations (4.159) and
(4.160).
From (4.155) we have
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
[
A
R3+γ + (χ + 1)ρv] −k
R2
(4.161)
where
χ + 1 =
3 + γ
3 + γ −m.
(4.162)
Also assuming p= γ
3ρ we have
−qH2 ≡
¨R
R
=
−4πG
3
(1 + γ)(
A
R3+γ + χρv) + 8πG

3
[1 + γ)
A
R3+γ + (3 + γ)(m −2)
3 + γ −m
ρv].
(4.164)
Deﬁne
θ ≡(3 + γ)(m −2)
3 + γ −m
(4.165)
we see that θ is always negative for m < 2! Thus if the vacuum term domi-
nates equation (4.164) then ¨R will be positive for m < 2. This agrees with
our previous consideration that if ρ =
α
Rm dominates the velocity equation
then m < 2 leads to inﬂation.
Note however that θ can be negative for other values of m as shown in
Table 4.2.

Having established that a decaying Cosmological Constant can lead to
negative pressure, let us now work out the vacuum equation of state for a
decaying Cosmological Constant. Looking at (4.161) let us deﬁne
˜ρ ≡
A
R3+γ
(4.166)
and
˜ρv ≡(χ + 1)ρv =
3 + γ
3 + γ −mρv
(4.167)
so that
ρ + ρv = ˜ρ + ˜ρv
(4.168)
giving
H2 ≡(
˙R
R)2 = 8πG
3
(ρ + ρv) −k
R2 = 8πG
3
(˜ρ + ˜ρv) −k
R2
(4.169)
and from (4.164) we have
−qH2 ≡
¨R
R
=
−4πG
3
[(1 + γ)ρ −2ρv]
(4.170)
=
−4πG
3
[(1 + γ)˜ρ + (m −2)˜ρv]
(4.171)
which we would like to write as
−qH2 ≡
¨R
R = −4πG
3
(˜ρ + 3˜p) −4πG
3
(˜ρv + 3˜pv).
(4.172)
This is achieved if we make the following deﬁntions

76
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
˜p ≡γ
3 ˜ρ
(4.173)
and
˜pv ≡m−3
3
˜ρv ≡γv
3 ˜ρv ,
(4.174)
which is our vacuum equation of state for a decaying Cosmological Constant.
We see that for m< 3 we have ˜pv and γv negative. For a m < 2 we have
γv < −1 which we saw previously is the condition for inﬂation assuming
vacuum domination of the density and pressure.
It is also satisfying to note that the equation of state for the non-vacuum
component (equation 4.173) is identical to the equation of state for a perfect
ﬂuid that we encountered for models without a Cosmological Constant.
Alternative Derivation
Our deﬁnition of ˜ρ and ˜ρv above are not unique. We present alternative
deﬁnitions below which will give the same vacuum equation of state but
diﬀerent for the non-vacuum component.
In equation (4.161) the density is
ρ + ρv
=
A
R3+γ + (χ + 1)ρv
=
(ρo −χρvo)(Ro
R )3+γ + (χ + 1)ρvo(Ro
R )m
=
ρo(Ro
R )3+γ + ρvo[(χ + 1)(Ro
R )m −χ(Ro
R )3+γ]
(4.175)
We previoulsy deﬁned ˜ρ ≡
A
R3+γ and ˜ρv ≡(χ + 1)ρv. However we might
alternatively deﬁne
¯ρ ≡ρo(Ro
R )3+γ
(4.176)
and
¯ρv
≡
ρvo[(χ + 1)(Ro
R )m −χ(Ro

=
(χ + 1)ρv −χρvo
ρo

(4.177)

still obtaining
ρ + ρv = ˜ρ + ˜ρv = ¯ρ + ¯ρv.
(4.178)
Assuming p = γ

−qH2 ≡

Quantization
All of our proceeding work with the scalar ﬁeld was at the classical level. In
this section we wish to consider quantum eﬀects.
In section (2.4.2) we dervied the wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuper-
space approximation. We began with the Lagrangian in equation (2.20)
L = −κR3[(
˙R
R)2 −k
R2 + 8πG
3
(ρ + ρv)]
(4.183)
and identiﬁed the conjugate momentum p ≡∂L
∂˙R = −2κ ˙RR and derived the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation, after quantizing with p →i ∂
∂R, as
{−∂2
∂R2 + 4κ2[kR2 −8πG
3
(ρ + ρv)R4]}ψ = 0.
(4.184)

78
CHAPTER 4. ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR
Notice that our quantization ’didn’t do anything to the density.”
In the work that we have done in the present chapter we have made
an eﬀort to write the scalar ﬁeld as a function of R, i.e. φ = φ(R) and
using ρ =
1
2 ˙φ2 + V (φ) we have written as an eﬀective density ρ(R) for
the scalar ﬁeld.
Our intention has been to simply insert this ρ(R) into
the Wheeler-DeWitt equation (4.184). In our work on inﬂation we found
that for ρ ∝
1
Rm dominating the Friedmann equation then inﬂation occurs
for m < 2. If this density also dominates ρ + ρv in the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation, then a tunnelling potential will only be present for m < 2. Thus
inﬂation and quantum tunnelling require the same condition. This leads us
to the hypothesis that inﬂation and quantum tunnelling are identical! Or in
other words, inﬂation is simply a classical description of quantum tunnelling.
We call this hypothesis Quantum Inﬂation.
Quantum inﬂation is easy to validate for ordinary densities, either ρ or
ρv, that behave like ρ ∝
1
Rm . With our discussion of the scalar ﬁeld we have
written ρφ ∝
1
Rm so it would seem that the idea of quantum inﬂation also
works for scalar ﬁelds.
In our quantization procedure we ”didn’t do anything to the density.” In
terms of scalar ﬁelds then this quantization procedure is diﬀerent to what
other people do with quantization. The usual procedure [?, ?, ?, 20, 21] is
to quantize φ and R seperately and arrive at a Wheeler- DeWitt equation
in terms of both of these variables. Let us now study this procedure.
We begin with the Lagrangian
L = −κR3[(
˙R
R)2 −k
R2 ] + 2π2R3[1
2
˙φ2 −V (φ)]
(4.185)
where κ ≡3π

From this one can deduce that

(4.186)
and also
¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V ′ = 0
(4.187)
provided one uses

2 ˙φ2 + V and p = 1

The canonical momenta are

(4.189)
The Hamiltonian (H = pi ˙qi −L) becomes (using κ = 3π

H

(4.190)
=
−κR3[(

˙φ2 + V )] ≡0
(4.191)
where the result H = 0 is obtained by comparing the expression for the
Hamiltonian to the Friedmann equation (4.186). This Hamiltonian is exactly
analogous to the Hamiltonian we had in equation (2.22) where we had ρ
instead of 1
2 ˙φ2 + V .
Writing H in terms of the conjugate momenta we have
H = −κR3[ Π2

R2 −8πG

(

(4.192)
which, of course is also equal to zero.
This Hamiltonian is inherited to
equation (11.34), Pg.462 of the book by Kolb and Turner [21]. This equation
is re-arranged as

R2 Π2
φ + 9π2
4G2 (kR2 −8πG

(4.193)
In order to compare to our signal Wheeler-DeWitt equation let’s replace Πφ
with Πφ = 2π2R3 ˙φ, which results in
Π2
R + 9π2
4G2 [kR2 −8πG
3
(1
2
˙φ2 + V )R4] = 0
(4.194)
which is exactly analogous to our original Wheeler-DeWitt equation (2.24)
where we had ρ instead of 1
2 ˙φ2 + V .
Equation (4.193) is quantized by making the replacements
ΠR →−i ∂
∂R
(4.195)
and
Πφ →−i ∂

(4.196)
and setting Hψ = 0 to give

which is the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace approximation for
a quantized scalar ﬁeld φ. This is identical to equation (10.1.11), Pg.270 of
the book by Linde [36].
We identify the potential as
U(R, φ) = 9π2
4G2 (kR2 −8πG
3 V R4)
(4.198)
which is identical to equation (11.35), Pg.463 of the book by Kolb and Turner
[21]. In equation (10.1.25), Pg277 of the book by Linde [36], he gives an
expression for V (R, φ) = 3π
G V (a), so that our result does agree with Linde.
We can see that the above method of quantizing the scalar ﬁeld φ directly
is still consistent with our idea of Quantum Inﬂation.
Recall that ρ(R)
and V (R) in terms of φ(R) obvioulsy ρ, V and ˙φ2 must have the same R
dependence. Thus if ρ ∝
1
Rm then also V ∝
1
Rm in the same way. Thus our
potential U(R, φ) will alsways exhibit a tunnelling shape for m < 2. Thus
Quantum Inﬂation still works for U(R, φ) when φ is quantized seperately.

EINSTEIN FIELD
EQUATIONS
The Einstein’s ﬁeld equations are
Gµν = 8πGTµν + Λgµν
(5.1)
which are a set of 16 coupled equations which will give gµν (buried inside
Gµν) gives Tµν. Actually there are only 10 independent equations because
of the symmetry gµν = gνµ.
In principle our job is easy. Just write down Tµν and solve for gµν which
speciﬁes the metric. Then we can calculate the paths of light rays, the orbits
of planets, etc. In practice the solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equations are
exceedingly diﬃcult and only a few exact solutions are known.
Two excellent reference for this section are Chapter 7 of the book by
Lawden [?] and Chapter 2 of the book by Islam [13].
In actual practice, the way one usually solves the Einstein’s equations
is to specify a metric in general terms which contains unknown coeﬃcients.
This metric is substituted into the Einstein equations and one solves for the
unknown coeﬃcients.
Thus we need to learn how to derive the metric for the spaces un-
der consideration.
Let us learn how to derive the Friedmann-Robertson-
Walker (FRW) metric which is the metric appropriate to a homogeneous
and isotropic universe but where size can change with time.

Preview of Riemannian Geometry
5.1.1
Polar Coordinate
A general N-dimensional Riemannian space, denoted by RN , is one in which
the distance ds between two neighboring points can be written (Pg. 88 [?])
ds2 = gµνdxµdxν.
(5.2)
If coordinates can be found such that
ds2 = dxµdxν
(5.3)
over the whole space then the space is said to be Euclidean and is denoted
by EN. Clearly EN is a special case of RN.
Below we shall restrict our discussion to the spatial part of the metric
denoted as
dℓ2 = hijdxidxj.
(5.4)
We shall very often have (eg. FRW and special relativity metrics)
ds2 = c2dt2 −dℓ2
(5.5)
so that
hij = −gij.
(5.6)
Consider the two dimensional space where
dℓ2 = dr2 + r2dθ2.
(5.7)
Here h11 = 1, h12 = h21 = 0, h22 = r2. The space looks like R2 but actually it
is E2 because we can ﬁnd coordinate such that (5.3) is true. These coordinate
are the two-dimensional plane polar coordinates
x
=
r cos θ
(5.8)
y
=
r sin θ
(5.9)
in which
dℓ2 = dx2 + dy2,
(5.10)
with g11 = g22=1 and g12 = g21 = 0 or gµν = δµν.

5.1. PREVIEW OF RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY
85
Recall that for 3-dimensional spherical polar coordinates
x
=
r sin θ cos φ
(5.11)
y
=
r sin θ sin φ
(5.12)
z
=
r cos θ
(5.13)
and the increments of length dℓr, dℓθ, dℓφ is the er, eθ and eφ directions
respectively are
dℓr
=
dr
(5.14)
dℓθ
=
rdθ
(5.15)
dℓφ
=
r sin θdφ.
(5.16)
Thus the surfaces of a sphere is an example of a space which is R2 and
cannot be reduced to E2. On the surface of the sphere the distance between
two points is
dℓ2
=
dℓ2
θ + dℓ2
φ
(5.17)
=
r2dθ2 + r2 sin2 θdφ2
(5.18)
where h11 = r2, h12 = h21 = 0, h22 = r2 sin2 θ. For this surface it is not
possible to ﬁnd x, y such that ds2 = dx2 + dy2 and therefore the surface of
a sphere is not E∈but rather a genuine R∈space.
5.1.2
Volumes and Change of Coordinates
The measure is the volume element in some set of coordinates. There are 3
ways to calculate the measure.
1) Inﬁnitesimal Length Method is one in which one identiﬁes the inﬁn-
tesimal increments of length and simply multiplies them together to get the
volume element. In Cartesian Coordinates we have dℓx = dx, dℓy = dy, and
dℓz = dz to give
dV = dℓxdℓydℓz = dxdydz.
(5.19)
In 2-d plane polar coordinates dℓr = dr and dℓθ = rdθ to give
dV = dℓrdℓθ = rdrdθ
(5.20)
(actually this ”volume” is an area). In 3-D spherical polar coordinates dℓr =
dr, dℓθ = dθ and dℓφ = r sin dφ to give
dV = dℓrdℓθdℓφ = r2 sin θdrdθdφ.
(5.21)

86
CHAPTER 5. EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS
2) Jacobian Method is the one usually mentioned in introductory calculus
books ([?] Pg.746) for changing variables. Suppose x = x(u, v) and y =
y(u, v) then
Z Z
f(x, y)dxdy =
Z Z
f[x(u, v), y(u, v)] | J(u, v) | dudv
(5.22)
where | J(u, v) | is the modulus of the Jacobian deﬁned as
J(u, v) ≡
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
∂x
∂u
∂x
∂v
∂y
∂u
∂y
∂v
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
(5.23)
For 3-dimensions with x = x(u, v, w), y = y(u, v, w) and z = z(u, v, w) we
have
J(u, v, w) ≡
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
∂x
∂u
∂x
∂v
∂x
∂w

∂u
∂y
∂v
∂y
∂w
∂z
∂u
∂z
∂v
∂z
∂w
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
(5.24)
For Cartesian coordinates obviously J(x, y, z) = 1. For plane polar coordi-
nates (x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ)
J(r, θ) =
¯¯¯¯¯
cos θ
−r sin θ
sin θ
r cos θ
¯¯¯¯¯ = r
(5.25)
and for spherical polar coordinates (x = r sin θ cos φ, y = r sin θ cos φ, z =
r cos θ)
J(r, θ, φ) =
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
sin θ cos φ
r cos θ cos φ
−r sin θ sin φ
sin θ sin φ
r cos θ sin φ
r sin θ cos φ
cos θ
−r sin θ
0
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
= r2 sin θ
(5.26)
The volume element in 2-d is
dV =| J(u, v) | dudv
(5.27)
and in 3-d it is
dV =| J(u, v, w) | dudvdw
(5.28)
which then reproduce equations (5.19), (5.139) and (5.140) for Cartesian,
plane polar and spherical polar coordinates.
3) Metric Tensor Method is what we prefer in general relativity. Here
([21], Pg.33)

5.1. PREVIEW OF RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY
87
dV =
√
hdudvdw
(5.29)
where h is the determinant of the spatial metric tensor. Thus
| J |=
√
h
(5.30)
For a plane polar coordinates ds2 = dr2 + r2dθ2 ≡gijdxidxj so that
h =
¯¯¯¯¯
1
0
0
r2
¯¯¯¯¯ = r2
(5.31)
giving
√
h = r so that dV =
√
hdrdθ in agreement with (5.139). For spherical
polar coordinates dℓ2 = dr2 + r2dθ2 + r2 sin2 θdφ2 ≡hijdxidxj giving
h =
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
1
0
0
0
r2

r2 sin2 θ
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

(5.32)
giving
√
h = r2 sin θ so that dV =
√
hdrdθdφ = r2 sin θdrdθdφ in agreement
with (5.140).
Thus deﬁne
d2x
≡
dudv
d3x
≡
dudvdw
d4x
≡
dudvdwdt
(5.33)
so that the measure is
dV =
√
hd2x or
√
hd3x
(5.34)
depending on the number of dimensions. It is important to remember that
d3x or d4x om this notation is not dℓ1dℓ2dℓ3 or dℓ1dℓ2dℓ3dℓ4 but simply only
the coordinates. For example in spherical polar coordinates
d3x ≡drdθdφ
(5.35)
or with time
d4x ≡drdθdφdt.
(5.36)
The measure is volume is obtained with dV =
√
hd3x or √−gd4x (because
for 4-d we use gµν and hij = −gij and h = −g). Thus in general

dV ̸= d3x
or
dV ̸= d4x
in contrast to conventions used, say in undergraduate physics books.
5.1.3
Diﬀerential Geometry
A Good reference for diﬀerential geometry is the book by Lipschutz [?].
Introductory material is discussed by Purcell and Varberg [?] (Pg.625-634,
285-290).
Previously we wrote the deﬁnition of a circle as x2 + y2 = r2 which
could be written generally as y = y(x). The same equation can be expressed
parametrically in terms of the parameter θ as x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ or
generally as x = x(θ) and y = y(θ). For many curves the form y = y(x)
can be clumsy and nowadays mathematicians always prefer the parametric
representation. (See [?] Pg.570). Another way to write our equation for the
circle (radius=1) is
x = cos θˆe1 + sin θˆe2
(5.37)
where ˆe1 and ˆe2 are basis vectors in E2.
Thus a general curve (Chapter 3 of [?]) is expressed as
x = x(t)
(5.38)
where t is the parameter. If the basis is chosen to be E2 then x = x(t) is
equivalent to two scalar equations x1 = x1(t) and x2 = x2(t). Thus a curve
can be speciﬁed in any number of dimensions. For our circle above we have
x1 = x1(θ) = cos θ and x2 = x2 = sin θ.
A general surface (Chapter 8 of [?]) is expressed as
x = x(u, v).
(5.39)
If, for example, the basis in E3 then
x(u, v) = x1(u, v)ˆe1 + x2(u, v)ˆe2 + x3(u, v)ˆe3.
(5.40)
Good references of the next 3 sections are the books by Kolb and Turner
([21], Pg.31-35) and Landau ([?], Pg.177-181) and Ohanian and Ruﬃni ([8],
Pg546-552) and Chow ([28], Pg.197-200) and the article by Kung [?].

5.1.4
1-dimesional Curve
Let us ﬁrst consider the circle, often called the one sphere denoted by S1.
Recall that for a circle the radius R, the proper way to express it is in terms
of 1-dimensional parameter θ as
x(θ) = R(cos θˆe1 + sin θˆe2).
(5.41)
However in introductory books one always introduces a ﬁcticous extra di-
mension and embeds the 1-d curve in a 2-d Euclidean space via
x2 + y2 = R2
(5.42)
which we recognize as the equation for a circle.
Remember though this
equation is really overkill.
It is a 2-d equation for a 1-d curve!
The 1-
parameter equation (5.41) is much better. We can also write
x2
1 + x2
2 = R2.
(5.43)
The element of length in the 2-d Euclidean space is
dℓ2 = dx2
1 + dx2
2.
(5.44)
In an ordinary 2-d Euclidean space x and y (or x1 and x2) are free to vary
independently and this is how the whole 2-d space get covered. Equation
(5.44) is true in general. However the reason that (5.42) or (5.43) describes
a circle is because it constrains the value of y in terms of x. This constraint
(5.42) picks our only those points in E2 which give the circle.
Equation (5.44) covers all of E2. We can constrain it for the circle by
reducing the two parameters x1 and x2 to only one parameter. Thus we will
have dℓfor the circle. We do this using the 2-d constraint (5.43) and writing
y =
√
R2 −x2 and dy =
−x
√
R2−x2 dx so that
dy2 =
x2
R2 −x2 dx2.
(5.45)
Note that dy2 ≡(dy)2 and dy2 ̸= d(y2). Thus (5.44) becomes
dℓ2
=
dx2 +
x2
R2 −x2 dx2
=
R2
R2 −x2 dx2.
(5.46)

90
CHAPTER 5. EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS
This can also be written in terms of the dimensionless coordinate
r ≡x
R
(5.47)
to give
dℓ2 = R2 dr2
1 −r2
(5.48)
where R is the radius of the space (the circle).
Another convenient coordinate system for the circle use the angle θ from
plane polar coordinates speciﬁed via
x
=
R cos θ
y
=
R sin θ.
(5.49)
Identifying the increments of length dℓR and dℓθ in the ˆeR and ˆeθ directions
as
dℓR
=
dR
dℓθ
=
Rdθ
(5.50)
then
dℓ2
=
dℓ2
R + dℓ2
θ
=
dR2 + R2dθ2
(5.51)
which gives the distance dℓin the 2-d space. To restrict ourselves to the rim
of the circle (curved 1-d space) we ﬁx dℓR = dR = 0 and get
dℓ2 = R2dθ2
(5.52)
which makes it obvious that the space is the one sphere (circle) of radius R.
Using simple trigonometry one can show that (5.52) is the same as (5.46).
(Do Problem 5.1)
Using dℓ2 ≡hijdxidxj we evidently have
hij = (R2)
(5.53)
which is a 1-dimensional ”motion”. The determinant is obviously h = R2
giving
√
h = R. This allows us to calculate the volume (we are calling the
length a geological volume) as

The 1-d curve that we described above is the circle or one sphere denoted
S1. However there are three 1-d spaces which are homogeneous and isotropic.
There are i) the ﬂat x line (R1), ii) the positively curved one sphere (S1)
derived above and iii) the negatively curved hyperbolic curve (H1). [21]
The formulas for a space of constant negative curvature [21] can be ob-
tained with the replacement
R →iR
(5.55)
to yield
dℓ2
=

−R2 −x2 dx2
=
R2
R2 + x2 dx2
(5.56)
or using r ≡x
R
dℓ2 = R2 dr2
1 + r2 .
(5.57)
These results are also obtained by embedding in Minkowski space ( do Prob-
lem 5.2).
The line element for a space of zero curvature is obviously just
dℓ2 = dx2
(5.58)
or using r ≡x
R
dℓ2 = R2dr2.
(5.59)
These formulas are obtained from S1 or H1 by letting R →∞.
We can collect our results for R1, S1 and H1 into a single formula

2-dimensional Surface
Kolb and Turner [21] analyze this problem very nicely. Other references are
listed following equation (5.40).
A surface is represented by two parameters u, v and expressed as x =
x(u, v) as mentioned previously. However we shall introduce a surface ﬁcti-
cious coordinate (three parameters) and embedding the surface in E3. Thus
with 3 parameters the equation for the two sphere is
x2 + y2 + z2 + R2
(5.62)
which we recognize as the equation for a sphere used in introductory books.
However this equation is overkill. It is a 3-d equation for a 2-d surface. We
can also write
x2
1 + x2
2 + x2
3 = R2.
(5.63)
Any 3-d Euclidean space E3 has length element
dℓ2 = dx2
1 + dx2

(5.64)
which under normal circumstances would map out the whole 3-d volume.
However (5.63) restricts x3 according to

(5.70)
Let us introduce plane polar coordinates in the x3 plane as
x1 = r′ cos θ
x2 = r′ sin θ.
(5.71)
These coordinates are shown very clearly in Fig 2.1, Pg.32 of Kolb and

CHAPTER 5. EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS
Equation (5.81) is alternatively obtained by identifying the increments of
length dℓR, dℓθ, dℓφ in the ˆeR, ˆeθ and ˆeφ directions as
dℓR
=
dR
(5.82)
dℓθ
=

(5.83)

(5.84)

(5.85)
gives the distance ds in the 3-d space. To restrict ourselves to the surface of
the sphere (curved 2-d space) we ﬁnd dℓR = dR = 0 and get
dℓ2 = R2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2)
(5.86)
in agreement with (5.81).
Using dℓ2 ≡hijdxidxj we evidently have for S2

(5.87)
The determinant is obviously

Actually there are three 2-d spaces which are homogenous and isotropic.
There are 1) the ﬂat x −y plane (R2), ii) the positively curved two sphere
(S2) and iii) the negatively curved two hyperbola (H2).
As before we can obtain the formula for H2 with the replacement
R →iR
(5.90)
to yield
dℓ2 = R2[ dr2
1 + r2 + r2dθ2].
(5.91)

This result is also obtained by embedding in Minkowski space. The metric
corresponding to (5.81) is ([21], Pg.34, equation 2.17)
dℓ2 = R2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2).
(5.92)
We can collect our results for R2, S2 and H2 into a single formula
dℓ2 = R2(
dr2
1 −kr2 + r2dθ2)
(5.93)
where k=0, +1, -1 for ﬂat (R2), closed (S2) and open (H2) surfaces respec-
tively.

(5.93) we have

where r = 0 at θ = 0 and r = R at θ = π

The integral and its limits are more clearly done with the substitution

Thus for k = +1 we have V = 4πR2 as before. For k = 0 we have V = ∞
and for k = −1 we need to do the integral again. We would ﬁnd V = ∞for
k = −1.
5.1.6
3-dimensional Hypersurface
Proceeding upwards in our number of dimensions we might inquire a ”curved
volume”. But the curvature can really only be imagined with respect to
embedding in a 4-dimensional Euclidean space E4. We call the 4-d space as
a hypersurface.
Our 4-d Euclidean space (into which we will embed the hypersurface)
has length element
dℓ2 = dx2
1 + dx2
2 + dx2
3 + dx2
4
(5.103)
(it is dℓ2 and not ds2).
A hypersurface is represented by three parameters u, v, w and is ex-
pressed as x = x(u, v, w). Introduce an extra ﬁcticious coordinate for the
three sphere S3 as
x2 + y2 + z2 + w2
=

Let us introduce spherical polar coordinates in the x4 hyperplane as

(5.110)

(5.111)
x3

(5.113)

Using

(5.116)
then (5.109) becomes
dℓ2 =

R2 −r′2 dr′2 + r′2dθ2 + r′2 sin2 θdφ2
(5.117)
Introducing the dimensionless coordinate

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Metric
The metric of Special Relativity is
ds2 = c2dt −(dx2dy2dz2).
(5.138)
Clearly the spatial part is a 3-d Euclidean ﬂat space. We have seen that the
spatial metric for a homogeneous, isotropic curved space with a size R(t)
that can change in time is
ds2 = R2(t)[
dr2
1 −kr2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2)].
(5.139)

100
CHAPTER 5. EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS
Replacing the spatial part of the special relativity metric with (5.139) we
have the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric [13]
ds2 = c2dt2 −R2(t)[
dr2
1 −kr2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2)]
(5.140)
where R(t) is called the scale factor and the constant k can be 0, ±1 depend-
ing on the curvature. This can also be derived with the use of Killing vectors
[13].
Writing ds2 ≡gµνdxµdxν and identifying
x0 = ct
(5.141)
x1 = r
(5.142)
x2 = θ
(5.143)
x3 = φ
(5.144)
we have
g00 = 1
(5.145)

g22 = −R2r2

(Note that this is not g = detgµν.) Thus

(5.151)
If gµν is represented by a matrix [gµν], then we found previously that
gµν is just the inverse of this metric namely [gµν]−1. For a diagonal matrix
(which we have for the FRW metric) each matrix element is simply given by
gµν =
1
gµν . Thus it’s easy to get

Christoﬀel Symbols
We now calculate the Christoﬀel symbols using equation (3.69). Fortunately
we need not calculate all of them. We can use the symmetry Γα
βγ = Γα
γβ to
shorten the job. We have
Γα
βγ
≡

2gαϵ(gϵβ,γ + gαγ,β −gβγ,ϵ) = Γα
γβ
=
1
2gαα(gαβ,γ + gαγ,β −gβγ,α)
(5.156)
which follows because gαϵ = 0 unless ϵ = α. (gµν is a diagonal matrix for
the FRW metric.) The only non-zero Christoﬀel symbols are the following:
Γ0
11 = 1
2g00(g01,1 + g01,1 −g11,0) = −1
2g11,0
because g01 = 0 and g00 = 1. This becomes (let’s now set c ≡1)

Ricci Tensor
Using equation (??) we can now calculate the Ricci tensor. For the FRW
metric it turns out that Rµν = 0 for µ ̸= ν, so that the non-zero components
are R00, R11, R22, R33. Proceeding we have

when we have performed the sum over ϵ. The term Γθ
0θ = 0. In the last
three terms we have Γα
0θ where α = 1, 2, 3. Now Γα
0θ = 0 for θ ̸= α, so that
we must have θ = 1, 2, 3 in the third, forth and ﬁfth terms respectively. Also
the second term contains Γ0
0θ which is always 0. Thus

Energy-Momentum Tensor
For a perfect ﬂuid the energy momentum tensor is given in equation (4.26)
as
Tµν = (ρ + p)uµν −pηµν
(5.177)
The tensor for T µν is written is (4.28) for the metric of Special Relativity.
For an arbitrary metric in General Relativity we have
Tµν = (ρ + p)uµν −pgµν
(5.178)
where we shall use gµν from our FRW model. For a motionless ﬂuid recall
that uµ = (c, 0) or Uµ = (c, −0) = (c, 0) = (1, 0) for c ≡1. Thus
T00 = ρ + p −p = ρ
(5.179)
and
Tii = −pgii

because ui = 0. Upon substitution of the FRW values for the metric given
