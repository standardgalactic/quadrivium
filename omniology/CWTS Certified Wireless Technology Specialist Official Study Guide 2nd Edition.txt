Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my wife, Jeannie, and two adult children, Ashley and Jason, for their 
support and patience during the writing of this book. They made completing this project 
much easier for me.
I would also like to thank everyone at Sybex who helped with the creation of this book, 
including acquisitions editor Jeff Kellum, production editor Eric Charbonneau, copy editor 
Liz Welch, editorial assistant Connor O’Brien and editorial manager Pete Gaughan. I owe 
all these individuals a lot of thanks for their patience while working with me on this book 
and keeping things on track. Jim Compton is the Development Editor for this edition of the 
book. Many thanks go to Jim for his time and his work in helping with the ﬂ ow, organiza-
tion, and suggestions that allowed me to make this book an easier read. His knowledge and 
attention to detail were a huge help. Also, thanks to Tom Carpenter the proofread technical 
editor for this edition of the book.
The Technical Editor for this edition of the book again is Bryan Harkins. I want to 
thank Bryan for his timely reviews, comments, and great suggestions that helped make this 
book a valuable reference source. His years of experience as a technical trainer, engineer, 
security specialist and author were a great contribution in creating a book I hope you will 
enjoy reading.
I would again like to thank the thousands of students who have taken the time to attend 
the computer networking classes I was given the opportunity to teach. Educating, mentor-
ing, and entertaining so many of these individuals gave me the inspiration and motivation 
to author this book and hopefully many more.
Of course, this book would not exist if it were not for the people at CWNP. The CWNP 
team has realized the need for vendor-neutral wireless LAN training and certiﬁ cation and 
has done a great job of building a brand over the years that is now known worldwide. 
Finally, a thank you to all the manufacturers, vendors, organizations, and individuals 
that provided the subject matter, allowing me the technology and tools needed to write this 
book.

Foreword
One of the most popular questions that we get through our Forums, customer service 
email, Twitter account, and phone system is this: “Where do I start in Wi-Fi?” Great ques-
tion, indeed. So what’s the answer? It depends.
It depends on where you are. If the whole subject of Wi-Fi or WLAN or 802.11 is just 
plain foreign to you, you should start right here: CWTS. We created the CWTS certiﬁ ca-
tion for you and people like you. The audience for the CWTS study materials and exam 
continues to grow, but the groups that make up the audience remain very constant. There 
are three main groups of people who are actively seeking their CWTS certiﬁ cation: IT Sales 
Professionals, IT Project Managers, and brand new IT Professionals. Yes, there are people 
with other titles that don’t fall into these buckets, but 80–90% of the CWTS audience falls 
into one of these three groups. Why? Another good question.
One of the reasons many people never try anything new is fear of the unknown. Even 
ten years into its life, Wi-Fi is still basically unknown in the IT world. Yes, everyone 
knows about Wi-Fi, but very few really know Wi-Fi in all its intricate detail. Do you 
doubt that? Next time you’re in the presence of a CWNE or CCIE-Wireless, ask them 
this question: “What percentage of network engineers really knows Wi-Fi?” The answer 
will be somewhere south of 50% and more likely lower. Think about that: after 10+ 
years on the market, astounding market segment growth every one of those years, and 
near ubiquity in homes and small businesses, your average mainstream network engineer 
doesn’t know Wi-Fi.
So why is that? From our perspective, it’s partly that “fear of the unknown” thing, and 
also the incredible fallacy that Wi-Fi is easy, plug-n-play, anyone can do it, etc. That fallacy 
was born from the fact that Wi-Fi got its initial growth and market acceptance in the home. 
You can still get a really good 802.11n home router for less than $100, and have it set up to 
connect all your household Wi-Fi devices in a few minutes. That is the perception that most 
IT folks take into their job, and that’s what gets them into a lot of trouble.
So this book, and the CWTS certiﬁ cation, serves as one early stepping stone to over-
coming the falsehood that, just because you set up your home Wi-Fi network in less than 
an hour, you can run a mission-critical enterprise Wi-Fi network with no new training or 
knowledge. This book will enable you, as a ﬂ edgling network engineer, project manager, or 
sales professional, to “get it,” meaning you will get the basics of Wi-Fi, RF behavior, and 
why a home Wi-Fi network is ever so much simpler than an enterprise Wi-Fi network.
Armed with this knowledge, you can “talk the talk,” so to speak, when it comes to 
implementing Wi-Fi. No longer will your Wi-Fi SEs talk over your head or feed you a line 
of bull just to see if you know what you’re talking about. When you understand the funda-
mentals of Wi-Fi, you are ready to jump with both feet into the amazing world of 802.11 
communications. This is your starting point, your ﬁ rst step, your headlong adventure into 
something new that you need no longer fear.

Foreword
Wi-Fi is here. Wi-Fi is everywhere. Wi-Fi is no longer a technology we wish we had 
everywhere all the time. Wi-Fi is everywhere all the time. Unfortunately, sometimes that 
Wi-Fi service stinks. Why? Why doesn’t it work? Why is it so hard to provide Wi-Fi to your 
customers, guests, employees? Well, you’re about to ﬁ nd out that Wi-Fi is not that difﬁ cult. 
It’s just that different. 
But we must warn you: Wi-Fi is cool. I mean it’s way cool. So be careful here. If you’re 
not ready to dive into a technology that may transform your spare time, learning capacity, 
and maybe even your career, you may not want to read any further.
Never be afraid to try something new. Remember, amateurs built the ark, 
professionals built the Titanic. — Unknown

Introduction
This book is intended to provide an introduction to the exciting and emerging world of 
IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology. This technology continues to expand at a phenom-
enal pace, with constant improvements in speed, performance, reliability, and security. 
Reading this book will teach you the fundamentals of IEEE 802.11 standards-based wire-
less technology, giving you an overview of the hardware and software components, radio 
frequency communication principals, terminology overview, and support and maintenance 
associated with wireless LAN technology, commonly referred to as Wi-Fi™. 
In addition to providing an overview of the technology, this book will help you 
prepare for the Certiﬁ ed Wireless Technology Specialist (CWTS) certiﬁ cation exam avail-
able from the Certiﬁ ed Wireless Network Professional (CWNP) program. CWTS is an 
entry-level enterprise wireless LAN certiﬁ cation, and is recommended as preparation for 
the Certiﬁ ed Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) certiﬁ cation. This certiﬁ cation is 
geared  speciﬁ cally toward wireless local area network (WLAN) support staff, sales and 
marketing personnel, or anyone who wants to become more familiar with the enterprise 
WLAN industry.
Not only will this book help you prepare for the CWTS Certiﬁ cation exam, it will give 
you the fundamental knowledge, tools, and terminology to more effectively sell and sup-
port enterprise IEEE 802.11 WLAN technologies. The main goal of this book is for you to 
learn “what it is,” not “how it works.” The “how” part comes later, in other CWNP Study 
Guides and instructor-led courses. After reading this book and completing all the avail-
able practice exam tools included, you will have the knowledge needed to take the CWTS 
certiﬁ cation exam.
For more information about the CWTS and other vendor-neutral wireless LAN 
certiﬁ cations from the CWNP program, visit www.cwnp.com.

Who Should Buy This Book?
Reading this book will provide you with an overview of IEEE 802.11 WLAN technology. 
This book is written with the CWTS exam objectives in mind and “what it is,” not “how 
it works.” The exam objectives were designed based on the skill set the intended audience 
should need in order to perform their job functions or roles in an organization. One thing 
to keep in mind is that this book will introduce and teach you a technology, a combination 
of computer local area networking and radio frequency.
If you follow the exam objectives, perform the hands-on exercises, and utilize all the 
available exam questions and practice exams at the book’s companion website (www.sybex
.com/go/cwts2e) and at www.cwnp.com, this book should be enough to effectively prepare 
you to pass the CWTS certiﬁ cation exam. It will also serve as a stepping-stone to more 
advanced books that teach the technology in more depth as well as a reference guide for the 
technology.
How to Use This Book and the Companion Website
Several testing features are in this book, and an exam engine that contains ﬂ ashcards 
and additional practice exams is available on the book’s companion website (www
.sybex.com/go/cwts2e). These are designed to test your knowledge of the information 
you have learned from reading the book and performing the exercises. Although there 
is no  guarantee you will pass the certiﬁ cation exam if you use this book and the addi-
tional online material, you will have all the tools necessary that effectively prepare you 
to do so. 
Before you begin  At the beginning of the book (right after this introduction) is an 
assessment test you can use to check your readiness for the certiﬁ cation exam. Take this 
test before you start reading the book; it will help you determine the areas you may need 
to brush up on. The answers to the assessment test appear on a separate page after the last 
question of the test. Each answer includes an explanation, shows a chapter reference, and 
describes why the other options are incorrect.
Chapter review questions  To test your knowledge as you progress through this book, 
there are review questions at the end of each chapter. As you ﬁ nish each chapter, answer 
the review questions and then check your answers—the correct answers appear on the page 
following the last review question. You can go back and revisit the section that deals with 
each question you answered wrong to ensure that you understand the material and answer 
correctly the next time you are tested on that topic.

xxxiv
Introduction
Electronic flashcards  You will ﬁ nd ﬂ ashcard questions on the book’s companion web-
site (www.sybex.com/go/cwts2e). These are short questions and answers, just like other 
ﬂ ashcards you may be familiar with and have used in the past. You can answer them on 
your PC or download them onto a tablet, smart phone, or other client device for quick and 
convenient reviewing.
Test engine  The book’s companion website (www.sybex.com/go/cwts2e) also contains the 
Sybex Test Engine. With this custom test engine, you can identify weak areas up front and 
then develop a solid studying strategy that includes each of the robust testing features described 
previously. The readme ﬁ le will walk you through the quick, easy installation process.
In addition to the assessment test and the chapter review questions, you will ﬁ nd two bonus 
exams. Use the test engine to take these practice exams just as if you were taking the actual 
exam (without any reference material). When you have ﬁ nished the ﬁ rst exam, move on 
to the next one to solidify your test-taking skills. After you get a high percentage of the 
answers correct, it is an indication you are ready to take the actual certiﬁ cation exam.
Labs and exercises  Several chapters in this book have lab exercises that use evaluation 
software that is downloadable from the manufacturer’s website, which can be linked from 
the book’s companion website (www.sybex.com/go/cwts2e). These exercises will provide 
you with a broader learning experience by providing hands-on experience and step-by-step 
problem solving.
White papers  Several wireless networking white papers and case studies are also provided 
on the book’s companion website (www.sybex.com/go/cwts2e) or available for download 
from other sources or the manufacturer’s websites. These white papers serve as additional 
reference material for preparing for the CWTS or other CWNP certiﬁ cation exams.
The CWTS Certiﬁ cation Exam (PW0-071) Is Based on the CWTS Exam 
Objectives
It is important to note that in order to pass the certiﬁ cation exam you should 
study from the currently posted exam objectives. Use this book as a learning aid to 
understand the CWTS exam objectives. For the most up-to-date certiﬁ cation exam 
objectives, visit the CWNP website at www.cwnp.com.
CWNP Exam Terminology
The CWNP program uses speciﬁ c terminology when phrasing the questions on any of the 
CWNP exams. The terminology used most often mirrors the language that is used in the 
IEEE 802.11 standard. While technically correct, the terminology used in the exam ques-
tions often is not the same as the marketing terminology that is used by the Wi-Fi Alliance 
or the manufacturers of WLAN equipment. 
As of this writing the most current IEEE version of the 802.11 standard is the IEEE 
802.11-2012 document, which includes all the amendments that have been ratiﬁ ed since the 

Introduction
xxxv
IEEE 802.11-2007 standard. Standards bodies such as the IEEE often create several amend-
ments to a standard before “rolling up” the ratiﬁ ed amendments (ﬁ nalized or approved ver-
sions) into a new standard.
For example, you might already be familiar with the term 802.11g, which is a rati-
ﬁ ed amendment that has now been integrated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard. The 
technology that was originally deﬁ ned by the 802.11g amendment is called Extended 
Rate Physical (ERP). Although the name 802.11g effectively remains the more commonly 
used marketing terminology, exam questions may use the technical term ERP instead of 
802.11g. A document with exam terms is available from the CWNP website. At the time of 
this writing, the URL to access this document is www.cwnp.com/exams/exam_terms.html.
CWTS Exam Objectives
The Certiﬁ ed Wireless Technology Specialist (CWTS) certiﬁ cation, covering the current 
objectives, will certify that successful candidates know the fundamentals of RF behavior, 
can describe the features and functions of wireless components, and have the skills needed 
to install and conﬁ gure wireless network hardware components. A typical candidate should 
have a basic understanding of data networking concepts.
The skills and knowledge measured by this examination are derived from a survey of 
wireless networking experts and professionals. The results of this survey were used in 
weighing the subject areas and ensuring that the weighting is representative of the relative 
importance of the content.
CWTS: Certiﬁ ed Wireless Technology Specialist Ofﬁ cial Study Guide has been written 
to cover every CWTS exam objective at a level appropriate to its exam weighting. The fol-
lowing tables provide a breakdown of this book’s exam coverage, showing you the weight 
of each section and the chapter where each objective or subobjective is covered.

B, D. A device driver allows the computer operating system to control the wireless network 
adapter and must be installed in order for the adapter to function. Client utility software 
allows a user to conﬁ gure the adapter with network speciﬁ c settings such as the SSID and 
security settings. Client utility software may be part of the computer operating system or 
third-party software provided by the manufacturer of the adapter. Site survey software and 
signal strength software may be part of the client utility software. AutoConﬁ g is a service 
that runs on a Microsoft Windows 7 computer. See Chapter 4 for more information.
2. 
C. The Network layer is responsible for addressing and routing of frames and is where IP 
addresses are used. The Data Link layer of the OSI model is responsible for compiling or 
packaging bits into frames. The Physical layer allows frames to be sent and received across a 
medium. The Transport layer is responsible for connection-oriented or connectionless protocols, 
and the Application layer is the “interface to the user.” For more information, see Chapter 1.
3. 
D. Local regulatory authorities manage the RF spectrum used in both unlicensed and 
licensed applications. The IEEE creates standards and the Wi-Fi Alliance certiﬁ es devices 
for interoperability. Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance is the former name of the 
Wi-Fi Alliance. For more information, see Chapter 2.
4. 
B. In a full mesh network, all nodes connect together with at least two paths for every 
node. This technology is on the increase in outdoor installations and starting to appear in 
indoor installations as well. It is common in metropolitan area networks and campus area 
networks. Many access points and wireless LAN switches/controllers have the capability 
built in. For more information, see Chapter 3.
5. 
A. A wireless repeater—which in most cases is a function of an access point—will extend 
the RF cell to allow users at a greater distance to connect. This will have an impact on 
throughput for users connected to the repeater and this solution is recommended only when 
necessary. For more information, see Chapter 3.
6. 
A. Some wireless personal networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth, use FHSS for commu-
nications. This will potentially interfere with IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. DSSS, HR/

Answers to Assessment Test
10. A. Most manufacturers that offer utilities for wireless LAN adapters allow for additional 
conﬁ guration above and beyond the settings that are included with an operating system. 
Manufacturer utilities are not required for the adapter to operate, because some settings 
can be made in the device driver or a third-party client utility. Unless it is specialty client 
software, the utility is usually included with the adapter and is not subject to additional fee. 
Manufacturers’ client software utilities are unique to only those adapters and will not work 
across manufacturers. See Chapter 4 for more information.
11. A. An independent basic service set (IBSS) is an ad hoc network that is used for peer-to-
peer communications. No access points are used in an IBSS implementation. For more 
information, see Chapter 8.
12. E. An omnidirectional antenna has a horizontal radiation pattern of 360 degrees. The 
vertical radiation pattern will vary based on the gain of the antenna. This measurement 
is known as the beamwidth and is used for both horizontal and vertical radiation pat-
terns. Beamwidth is measured at the –3dB or half-power point. For more information, see 
Chapter 7.
13. E. 802.11n and MIMO commonly use up to three radios in either the 2.4 GHz ISM or the 
5 GHz UNII band. 802.11a/g uses one radio per band but can use two antennas for diver-
sity. 802.11h is for spectrum management. For more information, see Chapter 5.
14. C. The IEEE 802.11g amendment to the standard and the 802.11a amendment both sup-
port up to 54 Mbps maximum data rates. However, of the two, only 802.11g operates in 
the 2.4 GHz ISM band. 802.11b also operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band but only supports 
a maximum data rate of 11 Mbps. The IEEE 802.11n amendment allows support of up to 
600 Mbps. For more information, see Chapter 2.
15. D. Both DSSS and HR/DSSS channels are 22 MHz wide. 2.412 GHz and 5.160 GHz is the 
center frequency of some channels used. For more information, see Chapter 5.
16. B. IEEE 802.11g networks operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. 802.11a networks operate 
in the 5 GHz UNII bands and in the United States the 5.725–5.875 GHz ISM band. IEEE 
standards-based wireless networks do not use the 900 MHz ISM band. For more informa-
tion, see Chapter 6.
17. A. A local area network (LAN) is usually contained in the same physical area and usually 
is bounded by the perimeter of a building. A campus area network (CAN) includes a set 
of interconnected LANs within an ofﬁ ce or school campus and is usually within a limited 
geographical area. A wide area network (WAN) mostly consists of point-to-point or point-
to-multipoint connections between two or more LANs and a metropolitan area network 
(MAN) consists of networks that may span from several blocks of buildings to entire cities. 
For more information, see Chapter 1.
18. A, D, G. SSID hiding, WEP, and MAC ﬁ ltering are legacy security mechanisms for IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks and should not be used. WPA and WPA 2.0 are Wi-Fi certiﬁ ca-
tions and are more advanced. Virtual private network (VPN) is a Layer 3 security solution 
typically used for remote access. RBAC is role-based access control. For more information, 
see Chapter 9.

19. C, F. In the 2.4 GHz ISM band, 25 MHz or 5 channels of separation is considered 
non-overlapping. Based on the IEEE 802.11-2012 Standard Clause 18, HR/DSSS channels 
must be separated by 25 MHz or greater in order to be considered non-overlapping. For 
more information, see Chapter 6.
20. C. The number of associated users will affect the capacity of an access point. The 
frequency range will affect the propagation as well as the output power. Reﬂ ections will 
cause multipath. For more information, see Chapter 6.
21. B. Low throughput may occur when too many client devices are associated to an access 
point and cause overloading. Load balancing would help to solve this problem. Because of 
DRS, the closer the client device is to an access point, the better the throughput. For more 
information, see Chapter 12.
22. B. An impedance mismatch between connections in a WLAN system will cause VSWR. 
The gain of an antenna is a relative value that has to do with the size or shape of the RF 
pattern emitted. Attenuation of cable adds to the overall loss of the system. For more infor-
mation, see Chapter 7.
23. D. Open system authentication is addressed in the IEEE original 802.11 standard and 
allows a wireless client device to 802.11 authenticate to an access point in order to 802.11 
associate. Shared key authentication is legacy and ﬂ awed and either cannot or should not be 
used. Open system authentication is a “null” authentication, is automatic and not secure. 
For more information, see Chapter 8.
24. A. The SSID is the name that identiﬁ es a wireless network. The MAC address of the access 
point radio is the BSSID. For more information, see Chapter 8.
25. B. 802.1X is for port-based access control and the terminology for the access point is 
authenticator. The RADIUS server is the authentication server and the client device is a 
supplicant. The RAS server is the predecessor to RADIUS. For more information, see 
Chapter 9.
26. C. A virtual private network (VPN) solution is a Layer 3 (Network) VPN security solution 
and is commonly used for remote access connectivity from unsecured networks such as hot-
spots. For more information, see Chapter 9.
27. B. A predictive analysis site survey will minimize the time required on-site for testing and 
analysis. This site survey will be accurate if the information about the location input is 
accurate. A manual site survey requires a walkthrough of the area and can be time consum-
ing. For more information, see Chapter 11.
28. B, D. The number of devices is an important determining factor in the number of access 
points required for a wireless LAN deployment as well as the software and hardware appli-
cations that may be used. The type and manufacturer of devices are not concerns. For more 
information, see Chapter 10.
29. C. A protocol analyzer will help identify existing wireless networks in an area and provide 
other information about these networks that can be used in the site survey/design process. 
An RF analysis is performed by a spectrum analyzer, which will also help locate sources of

RF interference. A protocol analyzer can help identify security-related issues from existing 
wireless networks but will not describe security requirements of a new wireless LAN. For 
more information, see Chapter 11.
30. A. The received signal strength represents how much of a transmitted signal is being received. 
If this signal is weak, the difference between the signal and noise may not be high enough 
to recover the data. If the power on an access point is high, it would provide more received 
signal. A signal-to-noise ratio of 35 dB is more than adequate. If the radio on the client was 
disabled, it would not be able to connect at all. For more information, see Chapter 12.
31. A, B, D. Wireless LAN technology operates and is speciﬁ ed at layers 1 (Physical) and 
2 (Data Link) of the OSI model. The Session layer opens, closes, and manages sessions 
between end-user application processes. The Network layer is responsible for addressing 
and routing functions of data and the Application layer is the interface to the user. For more 
information, see Chapter 1.
32. A, E. The signal to noise ratio is the difference between the received signal and the noise 
ﬂ oor. The common noise ﬂ oor value is –95 dBm, and an acceptable receive signal is –65 
dBm. Therefore the signal to noise ratio is 30 dBm. The RF channel is a speciﬁ ed frequency 
a WLAN operates in. The Fresnel zone consists of a number of concentric ellipsoidal vol-
umes that surround the direct, RF line of sight between two points such as an RF transmit-
ter and receiver. For more information, see Chapter 6.
33. A. Most enterprise-level autonomous access points have the capability to operate in root, 
repeater, or bridge modes. Root mode is the most common. Root mode allows devices to 
authenticate, associate, and access network resources and services. For more information, 
see Chapter 3.
34. E. Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA 2.0) requires CCMP/AES. TKIP/RC4 is optional. WEP/
RC4 is legacy and should not be used. It cannot be used with a robust secure network. RC5 
is a stream cipher and not used with IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. CCMP uses AES, not 
RC4. For more information, see Chapter 2.
35. D. CSMA/CA stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance and is used 
as an access method for wireless LANs to share the communication medium, which is the

 The OSI reference model

It is important to have an understanding of basic computer 
networking concepts before you begin exploring the world 
of wireless networking technology and its terminology. This 
chapter looks at various topics surrounding computer networking including network 
types (LAN and WAN), topologies, the OSI model, and device addressing. The chapter is 
intended to provide an overview of basic networking concepts as an introduction for those 
who need to gain a basic understanding or for those who want a review of the concepts.
You will look at the various types of wireless networks—including wireless 
personal area networks (WPANs), wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless metro-
politan area networks (WMANs), and wireless wide area networks (WWANs)—in 
Chapter 2, “Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking.”
Network Types
Personal computer networking technology has evolved at a tremendous pace over the past 
couple of decades, and many people across the world now have some type of exposure to 
the technology. Initially, personal computers were connected, or “networked” together, 
to share ﬁ les and printers. This type of network was usually conﬁ ned to a few rooms or 
within a single building. As the need for this technology continued to grow, so did the types 
of networks. Networking started with the local area network (LAN) and grew on to bigger 
and better types, including wide area networks (WANs) and metropolitan area networks 
(MANs). The following are some of the common networking types in use today:


Local area networks (LANs)

Wide area networks (WANs)

Metropolitan area networks (MANs)

The Local Area Network
A local area network (LAN) can be deﬁ ned as a group of computers connected by a physi-
cal medium in a speciﬁ c arrangement called a topology. The topology used depends on the

location where the network is installed. Some common topologies such as bus, ring, and 
star are discussed later in this chapter. Local area networks are contained in the same phys-
ical area and usually are bounded by the perimeter of a building. However, in some cases a 
LAN may span a group of buildings in close proximity that are on the same subnet. 
Common uses of early LANs were mostly for ﬁ le and print services. This allowed users 
to store data securely and provided a centralized location of data for accessibility when the 
user was physically away from the LAN. This central storage of data also provided the abil-
ity for a network administrator to back up and archive all the saved data for disaster recov-
ery purposes. As for print services, it was not cost effective to have a printer at every desk, 
so LANs allowed the use of shared printers for any user on the local area network. 
Figure 1.1 illustrates a local area network that includes both wired and wireless devices.

The Wide Area Network
As computer networking continued to evolve, many businesses and organizations that used 
this type of technology needed to expand the LAN beyond the physical limits of a single 
area or building. The local area networks began to expand into the wide area network
(WAN). As illustrated in Figure 1.2, a WAN mostly consists of point-to-point or point-to-
multipoint connections between two or more LANs and may span a relatively large geo-
graphical area. The WAN has allowed users and organizations to share data ﬁ les and other 
resources with a much larger audience.
WANs can use leased lines from telecommunication providers (commonly known as 
“telcos”), ﬁ ber connections, and even wireless connections. The use of wireless for bridging 
local area networks is growing at a fast pace, because it can often be a cost-effective solu-
tion for connecting LANs together.

Point-to-Point Connections
Connecting at least two LANs together is known as a point-to-point connection or link 
(see Figure 1.3). The connection can be made using either wired or wireless network infra-
structure devices and can include bridges, wireless access points, and routers. Wireless 
LAN (WLAN) point-to-point links can sometimes extend very long distances depending 
on terrain and other local conditions. These links can serve both wired and wireless users 
on the connected local area networks. 
Wired point-to-point links consist of ﬁ ber-optic connections or leased lines from local 
telecommunication providers. Wireless point-to-point links typically call for semidirec-
tional or highly directional antennas. With some regulatory domains such as the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC), when an omnidirectional antenna is used in this 
conﬁ guration it is considered a special case, called a point-to-multipoint link. Wireless 
point-to-point links include directional antennas and encryption to protect the wireless 
data as it propagates through the air.
Point-to-Multipoint Connections
A network infrastructure connecting more than two LANs together is known as a point-to-
multipoint connection or link (see Figure 1.4). When used with wireless, this conﬁ guration 
usually consists of one omnidirectional antenna and multiple semidirectional or highly direc-
tional antennas. Point-to-multipoint links are often used in campus-style deployments, where 
connections to multiple buildings or locations may be required. Point-to-multipoint WANs are 
often called “clouds.” Like point-to-point connections, wired point-to-multipoint connections 
can use either direct wired connections such as ﬁ ber-optic cables or leased line connectivity 
available from telecommunication providers.

The Metropolitan Area Network
The metropolitan area network (MAN) consists of networks that can span from several 
blocks of buildings to entire cities and interconnect devices for access to computer resources 
in a region or area larger than that covered by local area networks (LANs) but yet smaller 

6
Chapter 1  Introduction to Computer Networking
than the areas covered by wide area networks (WANs). The MAN is growing in popularity 
as the need for access in this type of environment also increases. MANs also include fast 
connectivity between local networks and may include ﬁ ber optics or other wired connectiv-
ity that is capable of longer distances and higher capacity than those in a LAN. 
MANs also allow for connections to outside larger networks such as the Internet. They 
may include services such as cable TV, streaming video, and telephone. Devices and con-
nectivity used with metropolitan area networks may be owned by a town, county, or other 
locality and may also include the property of individual companies. Wireless MANs are 
also becoming a common way to connect the same type of areas. Wireless MANs will be 
discussed further in Chapter 2.
Campus Area Networks
A campus area network (CAN) includes a set of interconnected LANs, is basically a 
smaller version of a wide area network (WAN) within an ofﬁ ce or school campus, and is 
usually within a limited geographical area. Each building within the campus would have a 
separate LAN, and the LANs are often connected using ﬁ ber-optic cable, which provides 
a greater distance than copper wiring using IEEE 802.3 Ethernet technology. Wireless 
connections between the buildings used with CANs are now a common way to connect 
the individual LANs. These wireless connections or wireless bridges provide a quick, cost-
effective way to connect buildings together in a university campus.
In a university campus environment, a CAN may link many buildings, including all of 
the various schools—School of Business, School of Law, School of Engineering, and so 
on—as well as the university library, administration buildings, and even residence halls. 
Wireless LAN deployments are becoming commonplace in university residence halls. With 
the number of mobile wireless devices increasing at a very fast pace in places like university 
campus residence halls, the number of wireless access points and the capacity of each need 
to be considered.
As in the university campus environment, a corporate ofﬁ ce CAN may connect together 
all the various building LANs that are part of the organization. This type of network will 
have the same characteristics of a WAN but conﬁ ned to the internal resources of the cor-
poration or organization. Many organizations are deploying wireless networks within the 
corporate CAN as a way to connect various parts of the business together. Like the uni-
versity CAN, in the corporate world wireless can be a quick, cost-effective way to provide 
connectivity between buildings and departments. All of the physical connection mediums 
and devices are the property of the ofﬁ ce or school campus, and responsibility for the 
maintenance of the equipment lies with the ofﬁ ce or campus as well.
Personal Area Networks
Personal area networks (PANs) are networks that connect devices within the immediate 
area of individual people. PANs may consist of either wired or wireless connections or 
both. On the wired side, this includes universal serial bus (USB) devices such as printers,

keyboards, and computer mice that may be connected with a USB hub. With wireless tech-
nology, PANs are short-range computer networks and in many cases use Bluetooth wireless 
technology. Wireless Bluetooth technology is speciﬁ ed by the IEEE 802.15 standard and is 
not IEEE 802.11 wireless local area technology. Bluetooth will be discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 5, “Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread Spectrum Technology.”
Like wired PANs, wireless PANs are commonly used in connecting an individual’s 
wireless personal communication accessories such as phones, headsets, computer mice, 
keyboards tablets, and printers and are centered on the individual personal workspace 
without the need for physical cabling. Figure 1.5 illustrates a typical wireless PAN 
conﬁ guration.

Network Topologies
A computer physical network topology is the actual layout or physical design and intercon-
nection of a computer network. A topology includes the cabling and devices that are part of 
the network. In this section you will look at several network topologies:

Chapter 1  Introduction to Computer Networking
Bus
A bus topology consists of multiple devices connected along a single shared medium with 
two deﬁ ned endpoints. It is sometimes referred to as a high-speed linear bus and is a single 
broadcast domain in which all devices on the bus network receive all messages. Both 
endpoints of a bus topology have a 50 ohm termination device, usually a Bayonet Neill–
Concelman (BNC) connector with a 50 ohm resistor. The bus topology is now considered a 
legacy design and was commonly used with early local area networking.
One disadvantage to the bus topology is that if any point along the cable is damaged or 
broken, the entire LAN goes down. Troubleshooting a bus network is performed by some-
thing known as the half-split method. A network engineer “breaks” or separates the link at 
about the halfway point and measures the resistance on both ends. If the segment measures 
50 ohms, there is a good chance that side of the LAN segment is functioning correctly. If 
the resistance measurement is not 50 ohms, it signals a problem with that part of the LAN 
segment. The engineer continues with this method until the exact location of the problem is 
identiﬁ ed. Figure 1.6 illustrates an example of the bus topology.

Ring
The ring topology is rarely used with LANs today, but it is still widely used by Internet 
service providers (ISPs) for high-speed, resilient backhaul connections over ﬁ ber-optic 
links. In the ring topology, each device connects to two other devices, forming a ring pat-
tern. Ring topologies in LANs may use a token-passing access method, in which data 
travels around the ring in one direction. Only one device at a time will have the opportu-
nity to transmit data. Because this access method does not use collision detection, it will 
commonly outperform the bus topology, achieving higher data rates than are possible 
using a collision detection access method. Each computer on the ring topology can act as a 
repeater, a capacity that allows for a much stronger signal. Figure 1.7 shows an example of 
the ring topology.

Troubleshooting the Bus Topology
I remember many years ago I was called to troubleshoot a problem on a small 
local area network using a bus topology. The network consisted of a network ﬁ le 
server, about 20 client stations, and a few network printers. The users complained 
of intermittent problems with the network. After spending some time looking over 
the network, I decided to test the bus using the half-split method and checked to 
verify that the cable was reporting the correct resistance using a volt-ohm-milliamp 
(VoM) meter. Sure enough, one side of the network cable reported the correct resis-
tance reading, but the other side was giving intermittent results.
After spending some time repeating the troubleshooting method, I was able to 
determine the problem. It turns out that someone had run the coax (bus) cable 
underneath a heavy plastic ofﬁ ce chair mat and one of the little pegs used to pro-
tect the ﬂ ooring was causing the intermittent connection as it struck the cable when 
the user moved their chair around the mat. I quickly replaced and rerouted the sec-
tion of cable in question. It is a good thing I was there during the normal business 
operating hours when the person was moving around in the chair or I might have 
never found the problem. Ah, the joys of troubleshooting a bus topology.

Star
The star topology, as shown in Figure 1.8, is the most commonly used method of connect-
ing devices together on a LAN today. It consists of multiple devices connected by a central 
connection device. Common central connection devices include hubs, switches, and wire-
less access points, although hubs are rarely used today. The hub provides a single broadcast 
domain similar to a bus topology. However, the switch and wireless access point both have 
intelligence—the ability to decide which port speciﬁ c network trafﬁ c can be sent to. A big 
advantage over the bus and ring topologies is that if a connection is broken or damaged the 
entire network is not down; only a single device in the star topology is affected. However, 
the central connection device such as a switch or wireless access point can be considered a 
potential central point of failure.

or device failure and a cost savings compared to full redundancy. Mesh technology can 
operate with both wired and wireless infrastructure network devices. The amendment to 
the IEEE 802.11 standard for mesh networking is 802.11s. This amendment was ratiﬁ ed in 
2011 and is now part of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.
Manufacturers currently are using proprietary Layer 2 routing protocols, forming 
a self-healing wireless infrastructure (mesh) in which edge devices can communicate. 
Manufacturers of enterprise wireless networking infrastructure devices provide support 
for mesh access points (APs) such that the mesh APs connect back to APs that are directly 
wired into the network backbone infrastructure. This is a form of wireless distribution sys-
tem (WDS) deployment. The APs or wireless controllers in this case are used to conﬁ gure 
both the wired and mesh APs.
F I G U R E  1. 9   Mesh networks can be either wired or wireless devices.

The OSI Model
Before we continue with wireless LAN technology, you should have some background on 
computer networking theory. The basics of a computer networking discussion start with 
the OSI model. The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model has been around for sev-
eral decades. It describes the basic concept of communications in the computer network 
environment. 
There are seven layers to the OSI model. Each layer is made up of many protocols and 
serves a speciﬁ c function. You will take a quick look at all seven layers of the OSI but only 
layers that pertain to wireless networking will be discussed in depth in this book. Figure 1.10 
illustrates the seven layers of the OSI model.

Physical
Wireless networking functions at the two lowest layers of the OSI model, Layer 1 
(Physical) and Layer 2 (Data Link). However, to some degree Layer 3 (Network) plays a 
role as well, generally for the TCP/IP protocol capabilities. Here’s how each layer is used:


Layer 1 (PHY, the Physical layer) consists of bit-level data streams and computer 
network hardware connecting the devices together. This hardware includes network 
interface cards, cables, switches, wireless access points, and bridges. In the case of 
wireless networking, radio frequency (RF) uses air as the medium for wireless com-
munications. The Physical layer consists of two sublayers: the Physical Layer Conver-
gence Protocol (PLCP) and Physical Medium Dependent (PMD). The PLCP, the higher 
of the two layers, is the interface between the PMD and Media Access Control (MAC) 
sublayer. The PMD is the lower sublayer at the bottom of the protocol stack and is 
responsible for transmitting the data onto the wireless medium. 


Layer 2 (Data Link layer) is responsible for organizing the bit-level data for communica-
tion between devices on a network and detecting and correcting Physical layer errors. 
The Data Link layer consists of two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer 
and Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer. The bit-level communication is accom-
plished through Media Access Control (MAC) addressing. A MAC address is a unique 
identifier of each device on the computer network and is known as the physical address. 


Layer 3 (Network layer) is where the Internet Protocol (IP) protocol resides and is 
responsible for addressing and routing data. An IP address is defined as a numerical 
identifier or logical address assigned to a network device. The IP address can be static, 
manually assigned by a user, or it can be dynamically assigned from a server. 


Layer 4 (Transport layer) Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented 
protocol and is used for communications requiring reliability and is analogous to a circuit-
switched phone call. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol and 
is used for simple communications requiring efficiency. UDP is analogous to sending a 
postcard through a mail service. You would not know if the postcard was received. UDP 
and TCP port numbers are assigned to applications for flow control and error recovery.

The OSI Model



Layer 5 (Session layer) opens, closes, and manages sessions between end-user applica-
tion processes.


Layer 6 (Presentation layer) provides delivery and formatting of information for pro-
cessing and display.


Layer 7 (Application layer) “Application” is another term for a “program” that runs 
on a computer or other networking device. Examples of Application layer protocols 
are File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Post Office 
Protocol v3 (POP3).
In order for computers and other network devices to communicate with one another 
using the OSI model, a communication infrastructure of some type is necessary. In a wired 
network, such an infrastructure consists of cables, repeaters, bridges, and Layer 2 switches. 
In a wireless network, these devices are access points, bridges, repeaters, radio frequency, 
and the open air. All will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 3, “Wireless LAN 
Infrastructure Devices.”
OSI Model Memorization Tip
One common method you can use to remember the seven layers of the OSI model 
from top to bottom is to memorize the following sentence: “All people seem to 
need data processing.” Take the ﬁ rst letter from each word and that will give you 
an easy way to remember the ﬁ rst letter that pertains to each layer of the OSI 
model.

Peer Communication
Peer layers communicate with other peer layers, and the layers underneath are their support 
systems. Peer layer communication is the “horizontal” link between devices on the network. 
Figure 1.11 shows only three examples of peer communication. Keep in mind, however, that 
this principle applies to all seven layers of the OSI model. This allows for the layers to com-
municate with the corresponding layer to which a device is sending or receiving information.

The purpose of encapsulation is to allow Application layer data communication between 
two stations on a network using the lower layers as a support system. As data moves down 
the OSI model from the source to the destination, it is encapsulated. As data moves back 
up the OSI model from the source to the destination, it is decapsulated. Each layer adds a 
header and/or trailer when information is being transmitted and removes them when infor-
mation is being received. Encapsulation is the method in which lower layers support upper 
layers. Figure 1.12 illustrates the process.

Device Addressing

Device Addressing
Every device on a network requires unique identiﬁ cation. This can be accomplished in a 
couple of ways:


Physical addresses


Logical addresses
The physical address of a network adapter is also known as the media access control 
(MAC) address. As shown in Figure 1.13, every device on a network (like every street 
address in a city) must have a unique address. 
The logical address is also known as the Internet Protocol (IP) address. Every device on 
a Layer 3 network (like every city’s zip code) must have a unique IP address.
F I G U R E  1.13   The MAC address is analogous to the address of buildings on a 
street.

Unique Address = 123
1st Street = LAN 1
2nd Street = LAN 3
The streets shown in Figure 1.13—1st, Main, and 2nd—represent Local Area Networks. 
The unique street addresses—10, 20, and so on—represent a unique address of each struc-
ture on a street as a MAC address would a device on a LAN.

16 
Chapter 1  Introduction to Computer Networking
Physical Addressing
The physical address of a network device is called a MAC address because the MAC sub-
layer of the Data Link layer handles media access control. The MAC address is a 6-byte 
(12-character) hexadecimal address in the format AB:CD:EF:12:34:56. The ﬁ rst 3 bytes 
(or octets) of a MAC address are called the organizationally unique identiﬁ er (OUI). Some 
manufacturers produce many network devices and therefore require several OUIs. A table 
of all OUIs is freely available from the IEEE Standards Association website at http://
standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt. MAC addresses are globally unique; 
an example is shown in Figure 1.14. The ﬁ rst 3 bytes or octets (6 characters) are issued 
to manufacturers by the IEEE. The last 3 bytes or octets (6 characters) are incrementally 
assigned to devices by the manufacturer.
F I G U R E  1.14   Example of a Layer 2 MAC address
The MAC address of a device is usually stamped or printed somewhere on the device. 
This allows the device to be physically identiﬁ ed by the MAC address. By typing the simple 
command ipconfig /all in the command-line interface of some operating systems, you 
can view the physical address of the network adapter. Figure 1.15 shows an example of the 
information displayed by using this command-line utility in the Microsoft Windows oper-
ating system.

Logical Addressing
Network devices can also be identiﬁ ed by a logical address, known as the Internet Protocol 
(IP) address. The Layer 3 IP protocol works with a Layer 4 transport protocol, either User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transport Layer Protocol (TCP). UDP is a connectionless 
protocol analogous to a postcard being sent through the mail. The sender has no way of 
knowing if the card was received by the intended recipient. TCP is a connection-oriented 
protocol analogous to a telephone call and provides guaranteed delivery of data. During a 
telephone conversation, communication between two people will be conﬁ rmed to be intact, 
with the users acknowledging the conversation. Routable logical addresses such as TCP/
IP addresses became more popular with the evolution of the Internet and the Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that is used with the World Wide Web (WWW) service. IP 
moves data through an internetwork such as the Internet one router (or hop) at a time. 
Each router makes a decision where to send the data based on the logical IP address. Figure 
1.16 shows a basic network utilizing both Layer 2 and Layer 3 data trafﬁ c.

Logical addresses (IP addresses) are 32-bit dotted decimal addresses usually written in 
the form www.xxx.yyy.zzz. Figure 1.17 illustrates an example of a logical Class C, 32-bit 
IP address. Each of the four parts is a byte, or 8 digital bits. There are two main IP address 
types: public addresses and private addresses. Private addresses are unique to an internal 
network, and public addresses are unique to the Internet. These addresses consist of two 
main parts: the network (subnet) and the host (device). Logical addresses also require a 
subnet mask and may have a gateway address depending on whether the network is routed. 
IP addresses fall under three classes: Class A addresses, Class B addresses, and Class C 
addresses.

Unlike a MAC address, an IP address is logical and can be either speciﬁ ed as a static 
address assigned to the device by the user or dynamically assigned by a server. However, 
the same command-line utility used to identify the physical address of a device can be used 
to identify the logical address of a device. 
Typing ipconfig at a command prompt displays the logical address, including the IP 
address, subnet mask and default gateway (router) of the device. The ipconfig /all com-
mand illustrated earlier in the chapter will yield additional information, including the 
physical or MAC address of the devices network adapter. This command is for a computer 
using the Microsoft Windows operating system. For some Apple and Linux devices, the 
ifconfig command will yield similar information. Figure 1.18 shows the ipconﬁ g utility 
displaying the logical address information, including the IP address and subnet mask.

Summary
This chapter provided a survey of networking topics to help you understand where wireless 
LANs ﬁ t into the larger networking picture. We began with an outline of the common net-
work technology types:

The next fundamental networking concept we discussed was topology, and we examined 
network topologies ranging from the legacy high-speed linear bus and ring to the current 
star topology, the most common topology used today with both wired and wireless net-
works. Although still in IEEE draft form, mesh networking is growing in popularity with 
wireless networking and is used in proprietary forms.
We then reviewed the basics of the OSI model, with the understanding that wireless 
networking technology operates at Layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model. Then we discussed the 
basics of peer communications and data encapsulation.
The chapter’s ﬁ nal topic was physical addressing. We explored the concepts of MAC and 
the logical addressing, including the IP address and subnet mask. A simple exercise using 
a computer with the Microsoft Windows operating system showed how to view device 
addressing information.
Exam Essentials
Understand the components of a local area network (LAN).  A local area network is a 
group of computers connected by a physical medium in a speciﬁ c arrangement called a 
topology. 
Know the different types of networks.  Networks types are LAN, WAN, PAN, CAN, 
and MAN.
Understand point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections.  These can consist of 
both wired and wireless connections and will connect two or more LANs together.
Become familiar with various networking topologies.  Bus, star, ring, and mesh are some 
of the topologies used in computer networking. Bus is considered legacy, and the star topol-
ogy is one of the most common in use today.
Remember the lower two layers of the OSI model.  The Physical layer and Data Link layer 
are the two lowest layers in the OSI model. Wireless networking technology operates at 
these layers. The Data Link layer consists of two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) 
sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer.
Understand the OSI model basics.  Each of the seven layers of the OSI model serves a spe-
ciﬁ c function. An overview of all seven layers is beneﬁ cial to know.
Understand device addressing.  Devices are assigned a unique physical address by the 
manufacturer. This address is known as the MAC address. Devices may also be assigned a 
logical address to identify devices on different internetworks.

IEEE 802.11 wireless computer networking continues to take 
computer communication to a new level. This communica-
tion technology is the combination of computer local area 
networking (LAN) and radio frequency (RF) technology. By combining these two technolo-
gies, computer users have the opportunity to access and share information in ways that 
would seem unattainable not too many years ago.
This chapter will examine various ways in which wireless local networks are used and 
deployed. We will also cover organizations that determine the use of radio frequency and those 
responsible for creating and managing wireless LAN standards. We’ll look in detail at the IEEE 
802.11 standard and its amendments, illustrating the communications and functional aspects. 
Finally, we will discuss interoperability certiﬁ cations for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks for 
communications, quality of service, and security that are available from the Wi-Fi Alliance.
The Wireless Computer Network
The main objective of this book is to provide an introduction to IEEE 802.11–based 
wireless computer networking, following the “what it is not how it works” philosophy. 
However, it is important to understand the various ways in which wireless ﬁ ts with com-
puter networking in general and the various physical applications. In this section, we will 
take a look at how wireless technology allows users to connect to and use resources in a 
wireless networking environment. Wireless networks come in a variety of types and sizes 
and include the following wireless topologies:


Wireless personal area network (WPAN)


Wireless local area network (WLAN)


Wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN)


Wireless wide area network (WWAN)
In Chapter 1, “Introduction to Computer Networking,” you learned about the differ-
ent types of computer networks. You will now look at some of these network types from a 
wireless perspective.
The Wireless Personal Area Network 
The personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects devices within the immedi-
ate area of individual people, as you saw in Chapter 1. With the use of wireless technology, 
PANs have evolved into the wireless personal area network (WPAN). This type of network 

28
Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
allows users to connect various devices wirelessly to their own personal area network, 
including but not limited to computer keyboards, mice, and headsets.
Bluetooth technology is becoming the most popular type of WPAN and uses frequency 
hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) for communications. Bluetooth falls under the IEEE 
802.15 standard, which speciﬁ es the WPAN standards. Bluetooth devices operate in the 
unlicensed 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientiﬁ c and Medical (ISM) band, as do wireless local 
area networks. The effects of FHSS and Bluetooth on a WLAN will be discussed further in 
Chapter 5, “Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread Spectrum Technology.”
WPANs may also use infrared technology, which uses near-visible light in the 850 nm to 
950 nm range for communications. Infrared technology was speciﬁ ed in the original 802.11 
standard, but according to the latest version of the standard is now considered obsolete. 
Regarding the Infrared (IR) speciﬁ cation, the IEEE 802.11-2012 Standard states that “The 
mechanisms described in this clause are obsolete. Consequently, this clause may be removed 
in a later revision of the standard. This clause is no longer maintained and may not be com-
patible with all features of this standard.”
The Wireless Local Area Network
As you learned in Chapter 1, local area networks (LANs) can be deﬁ ned as a group of com-
puters connected by a physical medium in a speciﬁ c arrangement called a topology. LANs are 
contained in the same physical area and usually are bounded by the perimeter of a building 
or a group of buildings. Wireless local area networks (WLANs) fall under the same descrip-
tion as a LAN but no longer require a physical wire to connect devices together. Wireless 
LANs have been in existence for many years, even prior to IEEE 802.11 standards-based 
technology, and mostly included proprietary technology or government deployments. 
Since the IEEE released the 802.11 standard in 1997, WLAN technology has continued to 
excel and is becoming a major component of every computer network. WLANs may operate 
in either the licensed or unlicensed radio frequency spectrum. The most commonly used fre-
quency spectra for WLANs are the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band and the unlicensed 5 GHz 
Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII) band. The frequency bands used with 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networking are discussed later in this chapter in the “Radio Frequency 
Regulatory Domain Governing Bodies and Local Regulatory Authorities” section.
The Wireless Metropolitan Area Network 
Metropolitan area networks consists of networks that may span from several blocks of 
buildings to entire cities and interconnect devices for access to computer resources in a 
region or area larger than that covered by LANs but smaller than the areas covered by 
WANs. You learned about this network type in Chapter 1. You can expand on this tech-
nology and add much ﬂ exibility to MANs by incorporating wireless technology and cre-
ating the wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN). The IEEE 802.16 Standard was 
developed to address this type of wireless network. This technology may fall under the 
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) category and addresses differ-
ent technologies. The WMAN may include a combination of public and private entities that 
encompass town services such as police, ﬁ re, and public utility access.

Common WLAN Deployment Scenarios
29
The Wireless Wide Area Network
You know from Chapter 1 that a WAN consists of point-to-point or point-to-multipoint 
connections between two or more LANs. WANS have the capability of extending very 
long distances through the use of ﬁ ber-optic connections or leased lines from telecom-
munications providers. When it comes to the wireless wide area network (WWAN), this 
extends beyond the point of connecting LANs together. The WWAN will encompass 
very large geographical areas and may include different wireless technologies, including 
cellular.
The WWAN also provides wireless broadband communications for Internet access 
through the use of special external adapters or even adapters built into notebook computers 
or other mobile devices, including smart phone technology. Because of the technology used, 
performance such as data rates will be lower than that expected and realized with IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking.
Common WLAN Deployment Scenarios
The availability and technology enhancements of IEEE 802.11 wireless networking have 
increased while the cost continues to decrease, making wireless LANs a viable solution for 
many business models, including personal use, home ofﬁ ces, small ofﬁ ces, and enterprise 
organizations. This section will look at various scenarios in which this type of wireless 
networking is used. We’ll explore the following common deployment scenarios that utilize 
wireless local area networks (WLANs):


Small office/home office (SOHO)


Enterprise deployments: corporate data access and end-user mobility


Extension of existing networks into remote locations


Other deployments, including municipal, law enforcement, and transportation 
networks
Small Office/Home Office
Many small ofﬁ ce/home ofﬁ ce (SOHO) businesses have the same needs as those of larger 
businesses with regard to technology, computer networking, and communication. These 

30 
Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
common needs regardless of the network size include access to a common infrastructure 
for resources such as computer data (ﬁ les), printers, databases, other networks, and the 
Internet. Computer networking technology is common regardless of the size of the busi-
ness. Whether there are 1 or 100 employees, many are categorized as small businesses. 
Wireless LANs now play a major role in small businesses. Many of these locations have a 
high-speed Internet connection such as DSL (digital subscriber line) or cable modem for 
access outside the local area network.
With the number of work-at-home professionals continuing to grow at a very high rate, 
the need for wireless networking in this environment is also continuing to grow. The same 
goes for the small ofﬁ ce environment. Deployments such as these typically involve a smaller 
number of users. Therefore, the equipment used may be consumer models sold in consumer 
electronics department stores and online retailers.
In addition, many companies or organizations now allow for employees to work 
remotely part or full time. In these cases the company network is now extended to the 
remote location, which, whether it is a home ofﬁ ce or other location, may be considered a 
branch ofﬁ ce of the company’s corporate network. When wireless LAN technology is used 
at a remote location, new concerns arise, such as data security and network availability. 
Depending on the size of the small ofﬁ ce/home ofﬁ ce and the number of potential users and 
devices, a WLAN RF site survey may be required. A site survey will help determine areas 
of radio frequency (RF) coverage and interference as well as the number and placement of 
access points. Even if the small ofﬁ ce/home ofﬁ ce will only require a single access point, it 
is still beneﬁ cial to know what other wireless networks or devices are in the same coverage 
area that may cause radio frequency interference.

Enterprise Deployments: Corporate Data Access and 
End-User Mobility
Enterprise organizations have used wired local area networking technology for decades. 
With the increased need for mobility, wireless LANs within enterprise organizations have 
also increased in popularity. In earlier years, due to lack of interoperability and security 
features, many enterprise organizations limited wireless LAN deployments to extensions 
of networks where wired connectivity was either not feasible or too costly. Because of 
advancements in wireless LAN technology over the recent years, IEEE 802.11 deployments 
in enterprise organizations are continuing to grow at a rapid pace.
Wireless LANs in the enterprise are used with—but not limited to—client workstation 
connectivity (desktop, notebook and tablet devices), printers, barcode scanners, voice 
handsets, and location services. The cost of this technology has decreased whereas capa-
bilities, performance, speed, and security have increased, making wireless an attractive 
solution for many enterprise organizations. The cost savings over hardwired solutions 
such as Ethernet are enormous, adding to the attractiveness. Finally, wireless connectiv-
ity is the only option in some cases, such as mobile Voice over Wi-Fi handsets for voice 
communications.
Figure 2.2 shows a ﬂ oor plan drawing of an ofﬁ ce area that may include a wireless 
deployment. Each individual or shared ofﬁ ce would contain one or two networked desk-
top computers and phones, and many would also have laptops. Printers might be located 
in centrally located common areas accessible to the individuals who have permissions 
to use them. The conference room might contain a videoconferencing system and an 
access point depending on the number of available seats, and the reception area might 
have wireless guest access for vendors or other visitors not belonging to the company 
or organization. Connecting all these networked devices to each other and the outside 
world are the wireless access point and other WLAN infrastructure discussed in Chapter 
3, “Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices”; these will be located throughout the facility 
based on the wireless network design to provide coverage and capacity for all wireless 
devices.
Extension of Existing Networks into Remote Locations
In its early days, wireless networking technology was typically deployed as an extension 
of an existing wired network infrastructure. For example, some users who required access 
to the computer network were farther than the physical limit of 100 meters that the IEEE 
802.3 Ethernet standard allows for a copper-wired connection, so other solutions were 
needed to provide this connectivity. Other wired technology, such as ﬁ ber optics and leased 
lines, was sometimes cost-prohibitive or not logistically feasible. Wireless local area net-
works were an excellent alternative. 
Now IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs are a major part of every network, including home, 
corporate, and branch/remote locations. Remote network locations may include the SOHO, 
branch ofﬁ ce locations, public wireless hotspots, and wireless Internet service providers 

32
Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
(WISPs). When a user connects to a corporate ofﬁ ce network from any of these scenarios, 
the network is basically being extended to a remote location. This extension should be 
treated as such with regard to network, security, availability, and performance. This chap-
ter discusses each of these deployment scenarios in more detail.

LAN technology
Public Wireless Hotspots
Portability and mobility are major beneﬁ ts of wireless networking. Portability allows users to 
access information from a variety of locations, either public or private. Mobility allows the con-
tinuous connection to a wireless network while a device is on the move. One example of porta-
bility is the wireless hotspot. In today’s world, it is rare to visit any public location, whether a 
restaurant, hotel, coffee shop, or airport, and not be able to ﬁ nd a public wireless hotspot.
A wireless hotspot is deﬁ ned as a location that offers wireless network connectivity for 
free or for-proﬁ t public or patron services. It allows a variety of mobile devices (computers, 
tablets, smart phones, and so on) to connect to and access public Internet and private network 
resources. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, many users work from remote locations and 
require Internet access as part of their job. This can include access from a wireless hotspot.
A typical wireless hotspot will be conﬁ gured with at least one wireless LAN router con-
nected to an ISP. In some cases, this setup could be as simple as a location offering free 
Wi-Fi Internet access for its customers. More sophisticated hotspots will have several wire-
less access points or a complete wireless infrastructure and will be connected to a remote 
billing server that is responsible for collecting revenue from the user.
In many cases, when a user connects to the hotspot router, they will be prompted with a 
web page for authentication. At this point they might be asked to enter information such as 
an account number, username and password, or a credit card number to allow usage for a 
limited period of time. In the case of a free hotspot, typically this web page lists terms and 
conditions the user agrees to prior to accessing the Internet. This type of web page conﬁ gu-
ration is known as a captive portal. Captive portals are discussed in more detail in Chapter 
9, “Wireless LAN Security Basics.”

Common WLAN Deployment Scenarios
33
Wireless hotspots can raise security concerns for the user. Without a secure connection, all 
information is passed in clear text through the air via radio frequency, potentially allowing 
an intruder to capture usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other information that 
could lead to identity theft. Most hotspots do not have the capability to provide a secure wire-
less connection from the user’s computer or wireless device to the wireless router or network. 
The secure connection then becomes the responsibility of the user. Since many corporations 
do allow employees to work remotely from wireless hotspot connections, extra security mea-
sures need to be explored and implemented. In this case, usually a virtual private network 
(VPN) is used to ensure security. A VPN creates a secure tunnel between the user and the 
corporate network, allowing for a secure encrypted connection for the user from the wireless 
hotspot to their corporate network over the Internet or public network.
For users who connect to wireless hotspots, it is very important for their wireless 
devices to be secured with the appropriate antivirus software, ﬁ rewall software, and up-
to-date operating system patches or service packs. Following these guidelines can help 
protect the user from attacks when they are connected to and using a wireless hotspot.
Figure 2.3 shows a simple wireless hotspot implementation.

Carpeted Office Deployments
Computer networking in traditional ofﬁ ce space, or “carpeted ofﬁ ces,” now rely on 
wireless technology to a large extent. This is for several reasons:


Cost


Portability


Mobility


Convenience

34
Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
Many ofﬁ ces do have an existing wired network infrastructure, and I do not expect that 
to go away any time soon. In most cases copper wire for Ethernet connectivity is already in 
place and is adequate for the intended use. However, the cost to upgrade the copper wiring 
or install new wired network drops can be expensive. Therefore, wireless LAN technology 
is an attractive alternative to wired networks in many ofﬁ ce deployment scenarios. What 
we are now seeing in the enterprise is a new era of wireless networks by default and wired 
networks only as required. Depending on the use of the network—that is, the types of soft-
ware applications and the number of devices requiring connectivity—wireless may be the 
best solution simply because of the cost.
Without trying to set ﬁ rm limits, it is common to connect as many as 20–25 users/
devices to a single wireless access point. However, the maximum size does depend on the 
software applications and the number of devices connected, as mentioned earlier. A major 
beneﬁ t of IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology is that an access point will require only 
a single Ethernet drop to support all the devices or users. Of course, don’t forget that an 
access point is part of a shared medium for everything that connects, and performance and 
throughput can be an issue if proper design practices are not used.
Again, remember the difference between portability and mobility. Portability allows 
users to access information from a variety of set locations, and mobility allows a continu-
ous connection to a wireless network while the device is moving. Carpeted space ofﬁ ces 
may have a need to provide support for both portability and mobility. For the user who 
moves from an ofﬁ ce cubicle to a conference room to attend a meeting, portability will be 
sufﬁ cient. In this situation they will probably shut down their mobile device, such as a lap-
top computer, and carry it to a conference room for the meeting. Restarting the computer 
will then require the device to reconnect to the wireless network, hence, portability.
Devices such as mobile phones using voice over IP (VoIP) or tablet devices usually 
require continuous connectivity to the wireless network while the user/device is in motion. 
This mobility feature allows uninterrupted communications and a pleasant experience for 
the user. Both portability and mobility provide the convenience network that people desire. 
Figure 2.4 shows a common ofﬁ ce scenario.
Educational Institution Deployments
Educational institutions can beneﬁ t from wireless networking in many ways. Wireless 
LAN deployments are common in elementary and high schools both public and private. 
Universities deploy campus-wide wireless LANs amounting to thousands of access points 
servicing tens of thousands of users on a single campus.
Wireless LAN technology allows for increased mobility in the educational environment, 
providing huge cost savings when technology needs to be refreshed. Mobile carts with note-
book computers are one example. A high school can deploy wireless infrastructure devices 
such as access points in classrooms and purchase several mobile carts with notebook or 
tablet computers to be used when and where needed. This is beneﬁ cial since it will save on 
supplying many classrooms with computers when continuous need for the computers or 
devices may be low. Some school buildings may be older or historic buildings and installing 
cabling is impossible or cost-prohibitive. Wireless provides the solution. The architecture of

many school buildings may also pose concerns that need to be addressed with many wire-
less network deployments. These include building materials, such as these:


Lath and plaster walls


Inconsistent materials due to building additions

These materials may cause issues because the radio frequency may not propagate well 
depending on the density and composition of the building materials. This means potentially 
additional wireless access points and extra design considerations.

36
Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
In addition, there may be modular or temporary classrooms; the issue with these is the 
density of devices and users, which will affect the wireless network capacity and may result 
in performance issues. Also, the location and distance from the main building should be 
taken into consideration because this equates to a point-to-multipoint connection and line 
of sight needs be taken into account. 
Some educational institutions are implementing a “one-to-one” initiative—in other 
words, the goal is to have one Internet-accessible device for every one student. This type of 
initiative will introduce density concerns, because of the potentially high number of stu-
dents in a single classroom. Educational institutions, whether an elementary school, a high 
school, or a college campus, should always consider starting with an RF wireless site survey 
and follow best practices from the equipment manufacturer to ensure a successful deploy-
ment. Figure 2.5 shows a typical small school environment.
Industrial Deployments
Some industrial organizations have been using wireless LAN technology for many years, 
even prior to the development of IEEE 802.11 wireless standards-based solutions. Examples 
of these deployments include barcode and scanning solutions for manufacturing, ware-
housing, inventory, and retail. Although this type of deployment may not be very dense, 
coverage is very important. Many businesses of this type include the following building 
characteristics:


High ceilings


Tall storage racks


Large inventory of product


Forklifts
These building characteristics can cause issues with wireless networks because of the 
way radio frequency propagates. With high ceilings, various antennas will need to be tested 
and coverage veriﬁ ed throughout the facility. Tall storage racks may have varying levels 
of inventory or product, resulting in poor propagation. Depending on what the products 
are made of, this will have a direct impact on the radio frequency behavior. For example, 
a high density of water products and paper products will absorb radio frequency. In many 
cases, forklifts will be outﬁ tted with wireless barcode scanners or other mobile devices that 
require the ability for fast secure transition capabilities.
In this type of environment, it is important to understand that radio frequency will 
behave in ways that could impact the performance of the wireless network. Chapter 6, 
“Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology,” will explain the behav-
iors of radio frequency in more detail. These behaviors can lead to coverage issues for the 
devices in use. Careful evaluation of this type of environment is essential, and an RF site 
survey is highly recommended to ensure proper RF coverage.
The physical characteristics of this type of environment are fairly static, although addi-
tional racks or shelving may occasionally be added. However, product inventory is dynamic 
and may change constantly. Moreover, forklifts and other product-moving equipment are 
constantly moving and in different locations. These are some of the factors that must be

Healthcare Deployments
The growth of wireless LAN deployments in the healthcare industry is quite impressive. 
Today, healthcare is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy. Healthcare 
environments pose many challenges for the design, deployment, and support of wireless 
networking.
Hospitals in most cases run 24 × 7 × 365 days a year. Wireless LANs have numerous 
applications in hospitals, including these:


Patient registration


Patient charting


Prescription automation


Treatment verification


Inventory tracking


Electronic medical records


Location services


Electronic imaging
One of the obstacles to take into consideration for wireless networking is interference. 
Hospitals use many devices that operate in the unlicensed ISM RF band. This can create 
challenges for design and reliability of the wireless network. Licensed and unlicensed RF 
bands are discussed later in this chapter. Other potential issues for healthcare deployments 
to be aware of include:


Building materials that can hinder RF propagation, such as lead-lined walls used in 
radiology areas to protect people from X-rays


Identical floor layouts above and below, which leads to stacking access point issues


Limited accessibility to areas such as surgery and patient care rooms 


Aesthetics of the installed equipment
Compliance with legislation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 (HIPAA) also needs to be taken into consideration when designing wireless 
installations for healthcare. Security concerns and different legislations will be discussed in 
Chapter 9. Figure 2.7 illustrates a common medical ofﬁ ce that uses wireless LAN technology.
Last-Mile Data Delivery: Wireless ISP
Last-mile data delivery is a term commonly used in telecommunications to describe the 
connection from a provider to an endpoint such as a home or business. (Last-mile is not 
necessarily a mile in distance.) This can be a costly solution in many applications, since 
each endpoint needs a separate physical connection. Wireless technology provides a more 
cost-effective solution for last-mile data delivery.
Some communication technologies, such as DSL, have physical limitations that pro-
hibit connections in some cases. It may not be cost-effective for telecommunication service

providers to supply connections in rural or semi-rural areas. Wireless LANs can service 
areas that may not be part of a last-mile run. Providing Internet access from a wireless ISP 
is one application. Things to consider for feasibility are line of sight, obstacles, and RF 
interference. Figure 2.8 shows an example of wireless last-mile data delivery.

Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
In December 2009 the 802.11 task group TGaf was formed to deﬁ ne the 802.11af 
amendment (not to be confused with IEEE 802.3af for Power over Ethernet). This amend-
ment to the 802.11 standard addresses the use of “TV White Space” frequency bands for 
use with wireless networking technology. These lower frequencies propagate well over lon-
ger distances and may be ideal to provide Internet connectivity for rural or semi-rural areas 
as well as other types of wireless technology innovation.
High-Density Deployments
What does the term “high-density Wi-Fi deployment” really mean? People have differing 
opinions on this, as it can be subjective. Some industry experts claim that in the next few 
years the number of installed wireless devices will exceed the number of installed wired 
devices. When you think about it, this projection may be realistic. Take a moment and 
count the number of wireless devices that you have in your possession, at your home, the 
classroom, and the ofﬁ ce. This includes notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, and 
broadband Internet devices. The average person may have between one and ﬁ ve separate 
wireless devices, many of which include IEEE 802.11 wireless technology. This gives an 
idea of how the density of wireless LAN devices in all environments—home, ofﬁ ce, educa-
tion, and industrial—will continue to increase in the coming years.
Some high-density deployments have been discussed in this chapter and include edu-
cational institutions and medical such as hospital environments. Issues to consider in this 
type of environment are the frequency band to use, co-channel interference, cell sizing, and 
access point capacity.
Municipal, Law Enforcement, and Transportation 
Networks
Wireless LANs are valuable technology in the industrial, municipal, and law enforcement 
ﬁ elds, and in transportation networks.
Federal and local law enforcement agencies frequently maintain state-of-the-art tech-
nology utilizing computer forensics and wireless LAN technology. Technologies that use 
19.2 Kbps connectivity are becoming obsolete because of their slower data transfer rates. 
Municipal deployments that include police, ﬁ re, utilities, and city or town services are often 
all connected to a common wireless LAN.
Transportation networks are no exception. Wireless LAN installations are becoming 
more common in places like commuter buses, trains, airplanes and automobiles. Users can 
connect for free or by paying a nominal fee. This type of connectivity now allows a user to 
better employ idle time. This is especially helpful to the mobile user or “road warrior” who 
needs to make the best use of available time.

Building-to-Building Connectivity Using Wireless LAN Technology
41
Building-to-Building Connectivity Using 
Wireless LAN Technology
Connecting two or more wired LANs together over some distance is often necessary in 
computer networking. Depending on the topology, this can be an expensive and time-
consuming task. Wireless LAN technology is often used as an alternative to copper cable, 
ﬁ ber optics, or leased line connectivity between buildings. Whether connecting two or mul-
tiple locations together, point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links can be a quick and cost-
effective solution for building-to-building connectivity.
Antenna selection plays an important role in this type of connectivity and will be dis-
cussed further in Chapter 7, “WLAN Antennas and Accessories.” Other factors to consider 
in either point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections are the radio frequency band 
used and the distance, both of which will determine whether a link is feasible for a wireless 
connection.
Wireless Point-to-Point Connections
As discussed in Chapter 1, connecting at least two wired LANs together is known as a 
point-to-point connection. Wireless point-to-point connections can provide long-range 
coverage depending on terrain and other local conditions. These links can serve both wired 
and wireless users on the connected local area networks. Wireless point-to-point connec-
tions typically call for semidirectional or highly directional antennas. With some regulatory 
agencies, when an omnidirectional antenna is used in this conﬁ guration, it is considered a 
special case, called a point-to-multipoint connection. Correct antenna selection is impor-
tant and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7. Figure 2.9 shows a wireless point-to-
point connection.

Wireless Point-to-Multipoint Connections
As you learned in Chapter 1, a network connecting more than two LANs together is 
known as a point-to-multipoint connection. With wireless networking, this conﬁ guration 
usually consists of one omnidirectional antenna and multiple semi- or highly directional 
antennas (see Figure 2.10). Point-to-multipoint connections are often used in campus-style 
deployments where connections to multiple buildings or locations may be required.

Wireless point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections are becoming more com-
mon with many IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN deployments, thanks to the low cost of the 
equipment and the ease of installation. The installation time for a wireless point-to-point 
connection can be as little as a few hours. 
RF Regulatory Domain Governing 
Bodies and Local Regulatory 
Authorities
Wireless networks use radio frequency (RF) to communicate. The RF spectrum needs to 
be regulated in order to ensure correct use of the allocated frequency bands. At the global 
level, the International Telecommunication Union–Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) 
is responsible for global management of RF spectrum, in addition to satellite orbits. This 
organization currently has 191 member states and over 700 sector members. It man-
ages ﬁ ve regions, one of which is Region A, North and South America, Inter-American 
Telecommunication Commission (CITEL).
Figure 2.11 shows all ﬁ ve regions and the geographic area they encompass.

Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
United States: Federal Communications Commission
The local regulatory authority that manages RF spectrum for the United States is the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC, founded in 1934, is (along with 
other local regulatory authorities) responsible for regulating the licensed and unlicensed 
radio frequency spectrum. IEEE 802.11 wireless networks may use licensed or unlicensed 
frequencies for communication between devices. A beneﬁ t of using unlicensed radio spec-
trum is no cost to the end user. The IEEE commonly uses two of three unlicensed RF bands 
allowed by the FCC:


2.4 GHz ISM

5 GHz UNII
Later in this chapter we will further discuss this and other details of standards-based 
wireless communications.
The unlicensed 900 MHz ISM band is not used with IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networking.
Licensed RF Bands Used with IEEE 802.11
Two additional licensed bands can be used with IEEE 802.11 networking:

3.650–3.700 GHz band


4.940–4.990 GHz public safety band
In 2008 the IEEE ratiﬁ ed the IEEE 802.11y amendment to the standard. This amend-
ment allows for the use of high-powered wireless LAN equipment to operate in the 3.650–
3.700 GHz band. Within the United States this is a licensed band that requires the user to 
pay some type of licensing fees.
The IEEE 802.11-2012 standard also speciﬁ es the use of the 4.940–4.990 GHz public 
safety band for use within the United States, consisting of 5 MHz, 10 MHz, and 20 MHz 
wide channels with both high and low power limits.
For additional information regarding radio frequency use in the United 
States, visit www.fcc.gov.
Europe: European Telecommunications Standards 
Institute
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is responsible for 
producing standards for information and communications technologies, includ-
ing ﬁ xed, mobile, radio, converged, broadcast, and Internet technologies in Europe. 

IEEE and Wireless LAN Standards 
45
ETSI was created by the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications 
Administrations (CEPT) in 1988.
In Europe, radio frequency use is managed by CEPT, which develops guidelines and 
provides national administrations with tools for coordinated European radio frequency 
spectrum management.
IEEE and Wireless LAN Standards
The IEEE (originally known as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), pro-
nounced “eye triple E,” is a nonproﬁ t organization responsible for generating a variety of 
technology standards, including those related to information technology. The IEEE is the 
world’s largest technical professional society. Since 1997 the IEEE has released a series of 
standards related to wireless local area networking.
This section describes the IEEE wireless networking standard and the amendments in the 
order in which they were ratiﬁ ed and released. They deﬁ ne what some call the power, range, 
and speed of the radio frequency and WLAN technology. This is because the IEEE 802.11 
standard speciﬁ es the maximum amount of radio frequency (RF) transmit power, the allowed 
radio frequency spectrum (which is related to the range), and the allowed data rates or speed. 
For additional information about the IEEE, visit www.ieee.org.
The IEEE 802.11 Standard
The IEEE 802.11 standard, released in 1997, is what initially deﬁ ned the wireless LAN 
communication standards. The data rates used in this original standard (1 and 2 Mbps) are 
considered slow compared to today’s technology.
As of this writing, the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard is the most current 
ratified IEEE 802.11 standard. This latest version includes the IEEE 
802.11-2007 standard and outstanding amendments at the time of 
ratification, such as IEEE 802.11k/n/p/r/s/u/v/w/y/z, into one document. 
However, many in the industry still refer to the original names of the 
amendments: 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and so on. The IEEE 
considers all of the previously published amendments and revisions 
retired as a result of the release of the new IEEE 802.11-2012 Standard. 
Device and application requirements for IEEE 802.11 are discussed in 
Chapter 6.
Here are the frequency range, spread spectrum technology, and data rates for the IEEE 
802.11-1997 standard:

Frequency hopping spread spectrum is considered legacy technology with regard to IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking. However, it is still used in other wireless technologies, such as 
IEEE 802.15 Bluetooth devices, and wireless cordless public switched telephone network 
(PSTN) telephones.

amendments, visit the Official IEEE 802.11 Working Group Project Time-
lines web page at www.ieee802.org/11/Reports/802.11_Timelines.htm.
The IEEE 802.11b Amendment
The IEEE 802.11b amendment to the 802.11 standard works in the 2.4–2.5 GHz ISM 
band. This amendment, released in 1999, speciﬁ es high rate DSSS (HR/DSSS) for 5.5 and 
11 Mbps.
The IEEE 802.11b amendment was released before the IEEE 802.11a 
amendment.

ogy, and data rates for the IEEE 802.11b amendment:

With the release of the IEEE 802.11b amendment, wireless LAN technology became 
more affordable and mainstream. This amendment introduced two higher-rate data speeds,

5.5 and 11 Mbps, making the technology more desirable. Today wireless infrastruc-
ture device manufacturers still support IEEE 802.11b wireless technology; however, it is 
unlikely you would be able to purchase any “new” devices that support only IEEE 802.11b 
technology. Devices sold today that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band will support IEEE 
802.11b/g/n and may be marketed as such or as IEEE 802.11g/n, which implies support for 
IEEE 802.11b.
The acronyms described in following section such as FHSS, DSSS, HR/
DSSS, OFDM, ERP, and HT are shown and defined to help explain the 
details of each amendment to the standard. You will learn more about each 
of these Physical layer technologies in Chapter 5.
The IEEE 802.11a Amendment
This amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard deﬁ ned operation in the 5 GHz UNII band. 
Released in 1999, this amendment originally deﬁ ned three frequency ranges in three 
bands—UNII-1, UNII-2, and UNII-3. The UNII-1 band is intended for indoor use only, 
the UNII-2 band is for indoor or outdoor use, and the UNII-3 band may be used indoors or 
outdoors but was most commonly used outdoors. The data rates for IEEE 802.11a are up 
to 54 Mbps using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM and other 
Physical layer technologies will be discussed in Chapter 5. Although this amendment was 
released in 1999, devices were not widely available until 2001.
Here are the frequency range, PHY technology, and data rates as speciﬁ ed in the original 
IEEE 802.11a amendment.

A beneﬁ t to using the 5 GHz UNII band is less interference, because not all wireless 
devices support operation in this band. Currently, many fewer devices use the 5 GHz 
UNII license-free band than use the 2.4 GHz ISM license-free band, including non-802.11 
devices. However, the number of wireless devices that operate in the 5 GHz band is always 
increasing. If there are fewer devices that utilize the band it means less interference, which 
allows for increased performance and reliability.

Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
Since the IEEE 802.11a amendment was ratified, some changes have 
been implemented and are now addressed in the IEEE 802.11-2012 
standard and previously the 802.11-2007 standard. They include a 
new frequency range (5.470–5.725 GHz) that is allowed by some local 
regulatory agencies and is known as the UNII-2e band. This extra fre-
quency space allows for 11 additional 20 MHz–wide nonoverlapping 
channels. Also, based on the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard, in the United 
States, one channel (channel 165 in the 5 GHz ISM) band is allowed 
to be used with IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology.
The IEEE 802.11g Amendment
This amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard was released in 2003. Like 802.11 and 
802.11b, it operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. This amendment addresses extended data 
rates with OFDM technology and is backward-compatible to 802.11 and 802.11b.
Here are the frequency range, PHY technology, spread spectrum technology, and data 
rates for the IEEE 802.11g amendment:



9, 18, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps OFDM data rates supported but not required
IEEE 802.11g is backward-compatible to 802.11 and 802.11b because it operates in the 
same 2.4 GHz ISM license-free band and supports the same access methods or technology 
as 802.11b. One beneﬁ t of IEEE 802.11g compatibility is that many established network 
infrastructures and devices have used 802.11 and 802.11b for years. This allows them to 
continue to operate as normal with upgrades or replacement as appropriate or necessary.
To allow the slower DSSS and HR/DSSS data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps 
to operate in an IEEE 802.11g network, the amendment addresses the use 
of protection mechanisms. These protection mechanisms will degrade the 
performance of IEEE 802.11g clients to some degree when IEEE 802.11b 
radios are present in the basic service area (BSA).

IEEE and Wireless LAN Standards
49
Some organizations are moving to drop support for IEEE 802.11b devices. This is 
accomplished by disabling the 802.11b data rates on the infrastructure devices—access 
points, controllers, and so on. They do this to minimize performance issues such as 
throughput when IEEE 802.11b devices are present in the IEEE 802.11g BSA. In some 
deployment scenarios, such as public wireless hotspots or areas with wireless guest net-
works, it would be difﬁ cult to disallow the use of IEEE 802.11b devices. However, this is 
strictly a decision to be made by the organization and information technology staff.
Maximizing Throughput in an IEEE 802.11g Network
In certain cases the only way to maximize the throughput of an 802.11g network is to set 
the data rates of the access points to support 802.11g data rates only. The trade-off is that 
802.11b devices will not be able to connect to the network, because the access point will 
not recognize the 802.11b data rates. This would work well where backward compatibility 
to 802.11b is not required and all equipment in use supports 802.11g. An analogy would 
be a group of individuals all speaking one language. They all understand the same lan-
guage, so they have no need to accommodate a second language.
Because of protection mechanisms deﬁ ned in the 802.11g amendment, throughput will 
degrade in an 802.11b/g mixed mode environment when 802.11b devices are present. 
The 802.11b devices have a maximum data rate of 11 Mbps (HR/DSSS), and they share 
the medium with the 802.11g devices that have a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps (ERP-
OFDM). Think of the language analogy. If a group of individuals are speaking two differ-
ent languages, a translator may be required for complete communication. A discussion 
among the group would take longer, because the translator would need to translate the 
languages. Likewise, protection mechanisms will have an impact on the throughput for 
the 802.11g devices, since the 2.4 GHz medium is shared. If there are no 802.11b devices 
in the radio range of an access point in an 802.11b/g mixed mode environment, protection 
mechanisms should not affect throughput since the access point will not have to share 
the medium with the two different technologies, ERP-OFDM and HR/DSSS.
If you do not have any 802.11b devices on your network, you can set your access 
point to 802.11g-only mode by disabling the 802.11b data rates. In this conﬁ guration, 
your 802.11g devices will perform better, because protection mechanisms will not 
be enabled. However, if there are any 802.11b devices that don’t belong to your net-
work in the “listening” range of the access point, data collisions will increase at the 
access point. This is because 802.11b and 802.11g operate in the same RF range, 
and the 802.11g (ERP-OFDM) access point would stop listening to the 802.11b (HR/
DSSS) transmissions. (It would simply see them as RF noise.) In this conﬁ guration, 
overall throughput will still exceed that of an access point set to 802.11b/g mixed 
mode in the presence of 802.11b devices. The access point will hear the 802.11b 
transmissions, but they will not be serviced since they are only seen as RF noise. 
Thus they will have less impact on throughput.

The IEEE 802.11n Amendment
After several years of drafts, the IEEE 802.11n amendment was ﬁ nally approved in 
September 2009. The release of this document opened the doors for manufacturers of IEEE 
802.11 wireless LAN equipment, giving them the opportunity to move forward with new 
technology that allows for better performance, higher throughput, and several other ben-
eﬁ ts. Wi-Fi certiﬁ ed devices under 802.11n draft 2.0 were available for several years prior 
to the ratiﬁ cation of IEEE 802.11n. Most if not all enterprise manufacturers had at least 
one wireless infrastructure device certiﬁ ed under draft 2.0 by the Wi-Fi Alliance prior to 
the release of the new amendment. 
Here are the frequency range, PHY technology, data rates, and other details for the 
IEEE 802.11n amendment:

IEEE 802.11n devices are capable of operating in both unlicensed frequency bands, the 2.4 
GHz ISM band, and the 5 GHz UNII band. This means that they must be backward-compat-
ible with previous technologies, such as IEEE 802.11b/g devices that operate in the 2.4 GHz 
ISM band and IEEE 802.11a devices that operate in the 5 GHz UNII band.
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a big part of what makes IEEE 802.11n such 
an amazing technology. Prior to 802.11n, IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices used a single radio to 
transmit and receive radio signals. This is known as single-input single-output (SISO) tech-
nology. MIMO uses multiple radios or “radio chains” to transmit and receive radio signals. 
SISO systems were subject to a phenomenon called multipath, in which several wavefronts 
of a signal would be received out of phase because of reﬂ ections. This is a problem for IEEE 
802.11a/b/g systems, whereas MIMO actually uses the reﬂ ections to help enhance the per-
formance and throughput using several radio chains in 802.11n. Multipath is discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 7. MIMO consists of several types of new technologies that include 
the following among others:

Additional IEEE 802.11 Amendments
In addition to communications, the IEEE creates amendments deﬁ ning speciﬁ c functional-
ity, including QoS and security. We will look at those functions next.
Although the following IEEE 802.11 amendments are not included in the 
exam objectives, it is important to understand this information as it per-
tains to the technology.
The IEEE 802.11e Amendment
The original IEEE 802.11 standard lacked QoS functionality features. In the original 
IEEE 802.11 standard, Point Coordination Function (PCF) mode provided some level of 
QoS. PCF mode is a function of the access point and allows for polling of connected client 
devices. This creates a contention-free period for data transmissions and provides QoS-like 
functionality. However, few if any vendors implemented this mode of operation.
The IEEE 802.11e amendment deﬁ nes enhancements for QoS in wireless LANs. 802.11e 
introduced a new coordination function, the hybrid coordination function (HCF). HCF 
deﬁ nes trafﬁ c classes and assigns a priority to the information to be transmitted. For exam-
ple, voice trafﬁ c is given a higher priority than data trafﬁ c, such as information being sent 
to a printer. The IEEE 802.11e amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2007 
standard and is now part of the IEEE 802.11-2012 Standard. The Wi-Fi Alliance created a 
proactive interoperability certiﬁ cation for 802.11e called Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM). The 
Wi-Fi Alliance and interoperability certiﬁ cations are discussed later in this chapter.
The IEEE 802.11i Amendment
The IEEE 802.11i amendment addresses advanced security solutions for wireless 
LANs, since the original IEEE 802.11 standard was known for security weaknesses. 
Manufacturers of IEEE 802.11 WLAN equipment addressed the following:


Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)

Service set identifier (SSID) hiding


Media access control (MAC) address filtering
TA B LE 2 . 2   Summary of 802.11 communication standards and amendments (continued)

IEEE and Wireless LAN Standards
53
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was deﬁ ned by the IEEE 802.11 standard intended to 
prevent casual eavesdropping. WEP was compromised early on, making wireless LANs vul-
nerable to intrusion and providing little if any security. This issue was addressed by stron-
ger security mechanisms (mainly CCMP/AES – Counter Mode with Cipher-Block Chaining 
Message Authentication Code Protocol /Advanced Encryption Standard) that became avail-
able with the introduction of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard.
Service set identiﬁ er (SSID) hiding and media access control (MAC) address ﬁ ltering are 
both manufacturer-implemented features that may be used by some for “pseudo” security. 
It is important to understand that neither of these provides any kind of security for an IEEE 
802.11 wireless network. 
WEP, SSID hiding, and MAC ﬁ ltering all have known security vulnerabilities, 
allowing for security weaknesses in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. The IEEE 802.11i 
amendment addressed security weaknesses with wireless LANS by including several 
enhancements, all of which will be discussed in Chapter 9. The IEEE 802.11i amend-
ment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard and is now part of the IEEE 
802.11-2012 Standard.
The IEEE 802.11r Amendment
The IEEE 802.11r amendment was approved in May 2008. The 802.11r amendment speci-
ﬁ es fast secure roaming or fast transition (FT) technology. The IEEE 802.11 standard did 
not address standards-based transition (roaming) mechanisms, so manufacturers used 
proprietary methods. The IEEE attempted to standardize transition techniques for wire-
less LAN technology with the ratiﬁ cation of a recommended practice, IEEE 802.11F. This 
recommended practice was never implemented by many (if any) manufacturers and was 
eventually withdrawn by the IEEE. 
The main goal of IEEE 802.11r was to provide fast transition for voice over IP (VoIP) 
with wireless LAN technology. Although this amendment has been ratiﬁ ed for some time 
and most enterprise equipment manufacturers support it, they still rely on the use of pro-
prietary methods for fast transition. This is partly because there was no interoperability 
certiﬁ cation until the formation of the Wi-Fi Alliance. The IEEE 802.11r amendment was 
incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 Standard. 
The IEEE 802.11k Amendment
IEEE 802.11k is the amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard that addresses radio resource 
management. This amendment was approved in May 2008, the same day as the IEEE 
802.11r amendment. 802.11k and 802.11r work together to form fast, secure basic service set 
transition for mobile devices. IEEE 802.11k aids the wireless device in locating the best access 
point to transition to, by deﬁ ning the technology to be used to manage the radio frequency. 
The IEEE 802.11k amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 Standard.
The IEEE 802.11w Amendment
Wireless LAN management frames, such as the 802.11 authentication frames and 802.11 
association frames used in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, are susceptible to intrusion and 
can cause security issues. This is because the IEEE 802.11 standard did not provide any 

54
Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
protection for management frame information that traverses the air. With some basic 
knowledge of the technology and the correct software tools, an intruder can perform a 
denial-of-service (DoS) or hijacking attack. When implemented, technology speciﬁ ed in the 
IEEE 802.11w amendment helps to mitigate these types of attacks or security issues. This 
is still considered newer technology and is not yet implemented by all manufacturers of 
wireless LAN equipment. The IEEE 802.11w amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 
802.11-2012 Standard.
The IEEE 802.11s Amendment
The IEEE 802.11s amendment speciﬁ es wireless mesh networking. Mesh networking with 
wired networking has been available for many years. Wireless mesh networking started 
with military deployments but has evolved into the public sector. Mesh networking allows 
infrastructure devices such as wireless access points or mesh routers to create a self-form-
ing, self-healing and intelligent network infrastructure. A wireless mesh network is some-
times referred to as a wireless distribution system (WDS). Most manufacturers of enterprise 
wireless equipment have been using mesh technology for years with proprietary protocols. 
Although the IEEE has ratiﬁ ed the standard for this technology, most manufacturers still 
use proprietary methods. Mesh technology will be discussed further in Chapter 3. The 
IEEE 802.11s amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 Standard.
Interoperability Certifications
By creating standards, the IEEE is encouraging technological progress. Manufacturers 
often implement wireless devices and networks in a proprietary manner, within or outside 
the standard. The proprietary approach often leads to a lack of interoperability among 
devices. In the wireless community, such practices are not widely accepted. Users want all 
of their devices to function well together. The combination of proprietary implementations 
and user dissatisfaction fostered the creation of interoperability testing and certiﬁ cations.
This section will discuss vendor interoperability certiﬁ cations related to IEEE 802.11 
standards-based wireless LAN equipment. These certiﬁ cations address communications, 
QoS, and security.
Wi-Fi Alliance
As mentioned in the previous section, the IEEE is responsible for creating the standards for 
wireless networking. However, equipment manufacturers are not required to provide proof that 
their equipment is compliant with the standards. Starting with the release of the IEEE 802.11b 
amendment, several early WLAN equipment manufacturers—including Symbol Systems, 
Aironet, and Lucent—formed an organization known as Wireless Ethernet Compatibility 
Alliance (WECA) to promote the technology and to provide interoperability testing of wireless 
LAN equipment manufactured by these and other companies. In 2000, WECA was renamed 
the Wi-Fi Alliance. The term Wi-Fi represents a certiﬁ cation and is often misused by people in 

Interoperability Certifications 
55
the industry. Wi-Fi is a registered trademark, originally registered in 1999 by WECA and now 
registered to the Wi-Fi Alliance. People often use the term Wi-Fi synonymously with wireless 
LAN technology; in fact it means wireless technology certiﬁ ed to be interoperable. 
For additional information about the Wi-Fi Alliance, visit www.wi-fi.org.
Figure 2.12 shows an example of a Wi-Fi certiﬁ ed logo, showing the device has met the 
interoperability testing criteria.

Wi-Fi Protected Access Certification
The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) certiﬁ cation was developed because security in the 
original IEEE 802.11 standard was weak and had many security vulnerabilities. This 
certiﬁ cation was designed as an interim solution until an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 
standard addressing security improvements was released. The IEEE 802.11i amendment 
addressed security for the IEEE 802.11 family of standards. The bottom line is that WPA is 
a pre-802.11i certiﬁ cation, introducing more advanced security solutions such as Temporal 
Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), passphrase, and 802.1X/EAP.
This pre-802.11i certiﬁ cation addressed two options for wireless LAN security: personal 
mode and enterprise mode. Personal mode is intended for small ofﬁ ce/home ofﬁ ce (SOHO) 
and home users. Enterprise mode is intended for larger deployments. Personal mode 
allowed for a user to enter an 8- to 63-character passphrase (password) on both the access 
point and all of the devices that connected to the access point. Enterprise mode provides 
user-based authentication utilizing 802.1X/EAP. Both personal and enterprise modes are 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 Certification 
The WPA certiﬁ cation by the Wi-Fi Alliance worked out so well that the alliance decided to 
certify wireless LAN hardware after the IEEE 802.11i amendment was released. This new 
certiﬁ cation, known as Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA 2.0), is a post-802.11i certiﬁ ca-
tion. Like WPA, WPA 2.0 addresses two options for wireless LAN security: personal mode 
and enterprise mode. This certiﬁ cation addresses more advanced security solutions and is 

56 
Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
backward-compatible with WPA. The following is a preview of its key points; we will look 
at both WPA and WPA 2.0 in more detail in Chapter 9.


The personal mode security mechanism uses a passphrase for authentication, which 
is intended for SOHO and personal use. The use of a passphrase to generate a 256-bit 
pre-shared key provides strong security. Personal mode may also be identified as pre-
shared key (PSK).


The enterprise mode security mechanism uses 802.1X/EAP for user-based authen-
tication, which is port-based authentication and is designed for enterprise imple-
mentations. 802.1X/EAP provides strong security using external authentication and 
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). 802.1X/EAP uses an authentication server 
for the user authentication. Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) 
is a common authentication server. This works well as a replacement for legacy IEEE 
802.11 security solutions.
Table 2.3 provides a high-level description of the WPA and WPA 2.0 certiﬁ cations.

Wi-Fi Multimedia Certification
The Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) certiﬁ cation was designed as a proactive certiﬁ cation 
for the IEEE 802.11e amendment to the 802.11 standard. As mentioned earlier in this chap-
ter, the 802.11e amendment addresses QoS in wireless LANs. The WMM certiﬁ cation 
veriﬁ es the validity of features of the 802.11e amendment and allows for a vendor-neutral 
approach to quality of service.

Interoperability Certifications
57
Quality of service is needed to ensure delivery of information for time-sensitive, time-
bounded applications such as voice and streaming video. If a wireless network user were to 
send a ﬁ le to a printer or save a ﬁ le to a server, it is unlikely they would notice any minor 
delay, or latency. However, in an application that is tuned to the human senses such as 
hearing or eyesight, latency would more likely be noticeable.
Wi-Fi Multimedia Power Save Certification
Wi-Fi Multimedia Power Save (WMM-PS) is designed for mobile devices and speciﬁ c uses 
of wireless LAN technology that require advanced power-save mechanisms for extended 
battery life. Here are some of these devices and technology that beneﬁ t from WMM-PS:


Voice over IP (VoIP) phones


Notebook computers


Tablet devices
Power-save mechanisms allow devices to conserve battery power by “dozing” for short 
periods of time. Depending on the application, performance could suffer to some degree 
with power-save features enabled. WMM Power Save consumes less power by allowing 
devices to spend more time in a “dozing” state—an improvement over legacy power save 
mode that at the same time improves performance by minimizing transmission latency.
Wi-Fi Protected Setup Certification Overview
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) was deﬁ ned because SOHO users wanted a simple way to 
provide the best security possible for their installations without the need for extensive tech-
nical knowledge of wireless networking. Wi-Fi Protected Setup provides strong out-of-the-
box setup adequate for many SOHO implementations.
The Wi-Fi Protected Setup certiﬁ cation requires support for two types of authentication 
that enable users to automatically conﬁ gure network names and strong WPA2 data encryp-
tion and authentication:


Push-button configuration (PBC)


PIN-based configuration, based on a personal identification number
Support for both PIN and PBC conﬁ gurations are required for access points; client 
devices at a minimum must support PIN. A third, optional method, near ﬁ eld communica-
tion (NFC) tokens, is also supported.
Security Hole with WPS
In December 2011 a security ﬂ aw was reported with WPS. This allegedly allowed an 
intruder to recover the personal identiﬁ cation number (PIN) used to create the 256-
bit pre-shared key. Acquiring the PIN would allow access to the wireless network. 
Wherever possible, it is recommended that users disable certain features in the 
wireless router or access point that allow this to happen. A ﬁ rmware update may 
also be available to provide adequate protection. Keep in mind that this solution 

58
Chapter 2  Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking
to the issue may only be possible with newer-model wireless routers. You should 
check with the manufacturer to determine if a solution (either a software setting or 
ﬁ rmware upgrade) is available for a speciﬁ c device. Otherwise, consider a differ-
ent method such as WPA or WPA2.0 to secure the wireless router. Upgrading to a 
newer wireless router is another possible solution.
Summary
This chapter discussed many applications in which wireless LANs are currently used, from 
small ofﬁ ce/home ofﬁ ce to corporate deployments and last-mile connectivity. Standards-
based wireless deployments continue to grow at a fast pace, adding new installations or 
replacing proprietary and legacy-based implementations.

Choosing the correct wireless LAN infrastructure devices to be 
installed as part of a computer network is a critical element of 
a successful wireless LAN deployment. In this chapter, we will 
look at a variety of infrastructure devices, including wireless access points, wireless mesh 
devices, wireless bridges, wireless repeaters, and wireless LAN controllers. This chapter will 
describe some of the features, beneﬁ ts, and advantages of these and other infrastructure 
devices. Power over Ethernet (PoE) is an extension to the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard that 
allows direct current voltage to be supplied over Ethernet cable to any PoE-capable device. 
Power over Ethernet now consists of two ratiﬁ ed amendments and is commonly used in 
enterprise wireless LAN deployments. This chapter will discuss the concepts involved in 
PoE, including both of its amendments to the IEEE 802.3 standard.
The Wireless Access Point
The wireless access point (AP) is an integral component of a wireless LAN infrastructure. 
Wireless access points are what allow a variety of wireless devices access to any network 
resources that the device or user may have permissions for. Wireless access points are avail-
able in three common types—autonomous, controller-based, and cooperative. Autonomous 
access points are self-contained units and can function as independent network infrastruc-
ture devices. Controller-based access points, by contrast, function in conjunction with 
the wireless LAN controller. Cooperative access points provide a wireless infrastructure 
without the use of a hardware controller. This chapter discusses all three types of access 
points—autonomous, controller-based, and cooperative. The AP provides computers, voice 
over Wi-Fi phones, tablets, and other wireless devices access to a local area network using 
radio frequency (RF) as the communication mechanism through free space (air) as the com-
munication medium. 
When a wireless device is connected to an access point, it is said to be in infrastructure 
mode. In this operation mode, all wireless data trafﬁ c is passed through the access point 
to the intended destination, whether that is a ﬁ le server, a printer, the Internet, or anything 
else. An access point can operate as a standalone network device, in which it is conﬁ gured 
independently to allow wireless devices to connect. It can also operate as part of a larger 
wireless network by sharing some of the same conﬁ gurations, such as the service set iden-
tiﬁ er (SSID). The SSID is the logical name or identiﬁ er that all devices connected to the 
access point will share. Figure 3.1 shows an example of an access point connected to an 
Ethernet network.

In addition to providing access through a shared medium, access points are half-duplex 
devices. Half duplex in computer terminology is deﬁ ned as two-way communication that 
occurs in only one direction at a time. (By contrast, full duplex, the other communica-
tion method used in computer networking, allows two-way communication to occur 
between devices simultaneously.) Communication only one way at a time means less data 
throughput for the connected device. An access point is a network infrastructure device 
that can connect to a distribution system (DS)—typically an Ethernet segment or Ethernet 
cable—and allow wireless users to access network resources. According to the IEEE 
802.11 standards, access points are considered stations (abbreviated STA). In a completely 
Ethernet-switched network, devices will communicate directly with the Ethernet switch. 
Figure 3.2 illustrates half-duplex communication in a wireless network.
The CWNP program uses the terms autonomous AP, cooperative AP, 
and controller-based AP to describe the following devices. In the indus-
try, they are also known as intelligent AP, split MAC architecture, and 
thin AP, or various other terms manufacturers use to identify them.
Autonomous Access Points
Autonomous access points are self-contained units with all the intelligence necessary to 
provide devices with wireless access to a wired network infrastructure and access to the 
resources the devices have permission to use. There are two popular types of autonomous 
access points—small-ofﬁ ce home-ofﬁ ce (SOHO) and enterprise. Not surprisingly, the enter-
prise type offers generally more robust features.

The SOHO Access Point
Although they are very powerful devices, SOHO-grade access points usually have a 
less extensive feature set than enterprise-grade access points. However, most consumer 
(SOHO)-grade and enterprise-grade access points now support the highest standards-based 
security options available, including Wi-Fi Protected Access 2.0 (WPA 2.0) certiﬁ cations. 
SOHO or consumer-grade access points are best used in the SOHO or home environment 
and usually have a limited number of connections for computers and devices. SOHO-grade 
access points have the following features:

IEEE 802.11 Standards Support
Most later-model SOHO access points support the current IEEE 802.11 standards, whereas 
others require ﬁ rmware updates for standards compliance. Some older devices have no 
ﬁ rmware update available, which can cause implementation challenges where interoperabil-
ity between newer and legacy devices is required. The 802.11 standards supported will vary 
based on several factors, including the cost and complexity of the unit. The most common 
SOHO access points support the IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g, and IEEE 802.11n commu-
nication amendments. Dual-band access points (which support both IEEE 802.11a/n and 
IEEE 802.11b/g/n) are not as common in the SOHO market. Most equipment manufac-
turers do make dual-band models, but the cost is normally higher than single-band (IEEE 
802.11b/g/n) consumer-grade access points. The wireless residential wireless gateway or 
broadband router is another popular device in the SOHO environment. We will learn more 
about wireless residential gateways later in this chapter. See Chapter 2, “Introduction to 
Wireless Local Area Networking,” if you need to review these 802.11 amendments.
Wi-Fi Alliance Certifications
Certiﬁ cations from the Wi-Fi Alliance are a common feature of SOHO access points. As 
mentioned in Chapter 2, these certiﬁ cations include WPA/WPA 2.0 and WPS for security, 
and WMM and WMM-PS for QoS. Selecting a SOHO access point that is Wi-Fi certiﬁ ed 
ensures compliance with IEEE standards and interoperability with other devices.
Removable Antennas
Some SOHO access points are equipped with removable antennas. This allows the end user 
to change to a larger (higher-gain) antenna, thereby allowing a radio frequency to cover a 

70 
Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
wider area. Conversely, connecting a smaller (lower-gain) antenna will decrease the cov-
erage area. Antennas and radio frequency radiation patterns are discussed in Chapter 7, 
“WLAN Antennas and Accessories.” Many SOHO access points have ﬁ xed or nonremov-
able antennas, so you cannot add a higher-gain antenna. 
RF coverage of an access point can be increased by adding a higher-
gain antenna to an access point. For more information, see Chapter 7.
Static Output Transmit Power
Occasionally an end user will have the ability to adjust the transmit output power in a 
SOHO access point. If this is available, the settings are usually very basic, such as low, 
medium, and high. With enterprise access points you can change the power in increments 
of mW or dBm. The transmit output power will determine in part the area of radio fre-
quency coverage, also known as the cell. The typical transmit output power of a SOHO 
model access point is about 15 dBm or 32 mW; however, this will vary with the manufac-
turer. An access point model with static output power cannot be adjusted, which will limit 
your ability to decrease or increase the size of the radio frequency cell. Changing the cell 
size will allow the user to cover a larger area in the home or small ofﬁ ce where the access 
point is installed. In this case, the only way to change the cell size is to change the gain of 
the antenna in models that have the removable antenna feature. Note that replacing the 
antenna will also change the vertical and horizontal beamwidths or radiation pattern that 
propagates away from it. 
Advanced Security Options
All newer-model SOHO access points support the highest security features, including IEEE 
802.11i, and WPA 2.0 personal and enterprise modes. These security features give users with 
limited technical knowledge the ability to provide the most up-to-date security for their wire-
less network. For those users who have greater technical know-how, SOHO access points 
also provide more advanced security features, such as 802.1X/EAP or virtual private network 
(VPN) pass-through. Users can ﬁ nd more information about these advanced features in most 
user guides provided with the access point or online at the manufacturers’ website.
Wireless Bridge Functionality
SOHO access points occasionally can be conﬁ gured in wireless bridge mode. Both point-
to-point and point-to-multipoint settings are available, enabling administrators to connect 
two or more wired LANs together wirelessly.
Wireless Repeater Functionality
Some SOHO access points can be conﬁ gured to function as wireless repeaters. Conﬁ guring 
an access point as a repeater enables administrators to extend the size of the radio fre-
quency cell, so that devices not in hearing range of an access point can connect to the 
wireless network. However, the cost is reduced throughput for other devices accessing the 
network through a wireless repeater. 

The Wireless Access Point
71
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server 
It’s also common for SOHO access points to be able to act as Dynamic Host Conﬁ guration 
Protocol (DHCP) servers. A DHCP server will automatically issue an Internet Protocol 
(IP) address (logical address) to allow upper-layer communication between devices on the 
network. IP addresses are a function of Layer 3 of the OSI model, as outlined in Chapter 1, 
“Introduction to Computer Networking.”
Configuration and Settings Options
SOHO access points are conﬁ gured via a web browser, using either HTTP (Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). This type of browser-
based conﬁ guration is an easy way for the novice administrator to make all the necessary 
settings based on the application in which the access point will be used. SOHO access 
points rarely offer conﬁ guration from the command line interface (CLI). Figure 3.4 shows a 
sample of a conﬁ guration page from a SOHO access point.
F I G U R E  3 . 4   SOHO access point configuration page in a web browser
For security, however, it is best practice to conﬁ gure the access point from the wired side 
of the network whenever possible. Conﬁ guration should only be done wirelessly if abso-
lutely necessary. If conﬁ guring the access point from the wireless side is the only option, a 
secure connection should be in place to prevent unauthorized access. 

72 
Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
Some manufacturers of SOHO wireless equipment have online 
emulators that allow customers to view a sample of the configuration 
process for a device. This allows a user to go through the configura-
tion of the device before making a purchase. 
The Enterprise Access Point
Enterprise access points typically have a much more extensive feature set than the previ-
ously mentioned SOHO access points. This section will look at some of the more advanced 
features available in enterprise-grade access points.
Figure 3.5 shows an enterprise-grade access point.

The Wireless Access Point

In addition to the items listed here, enterprise-grade access points have various other 
features that make them stand above the SOHO-grade access point. Some of these features 
include outdoor use, plenum ratings, industrial environment ratings, more memory, and 
faster processors to help handle the load and various environmental conditions.
IEEE 802.11 Standards Support
Like SOHO access points, enterprise access points also support IEEE standards. Enterprise 
access points have a more extensive feature set than SOHO access points, and depending on 
the manufacturer and model, they will support all communication standards by utilizing IEEE 
802.11a/n and IEEE 802.11b/g/n dual-band radios. Enterprise-grade access points can include 
support for some amendments to the standard not supported by SOHO-grade access points. 
Examples include support for IEEE 802.11e QoS, Wi-Fi multimedia, IEEE 802.11r fast BSS 
transition (FT), and IEEE 802.11w for the security of management frames, to name a few.
Wi-Fi Alliance Certifications
Certiﬁ cations by the Wi-Fi Alliance are an important feature of enterprise-grade access 
points. These certiﬁ cations include WPA/WPA 2.0 for Security, WMM, and WMM-PS for 
QoS. Selecting an enterprise-grade access point that is Wi-Fi certiﬁ ed ensures compliance 
with IEEE standards and interoperability with other IEEE 802.11–compliant devices.
Removable or Expandable Antennas
Many enterprise access points have removable or expandable antenna capabilities. These 
antenna conﬁ gurations provide a lot of ﬂ exibility, as an installer can choose the appropriate 
antenna based on the deployment scenario. Omnidirectional, semidirectional, and highly 
directional antennas are all types of antennas commonly used in the enterprise environ-
ment. Enterprise-quality access points that use internal antennas can offer options for 
connecting external antennas should they be required. Antennas will be discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 7.
Adjustable Output Transmit Power
Unlike some SOHO-grade access points, enterprise-grade access points have the capabil-
ity to adjust output transmit power. This feature allows an installer to select the correct 
amount of transmit power based on the installation needs of the access point. One beneﬁ t 
of having adjustable output power is that an installer can adapt to the environment in 
which the access point is installed. If the radio frequency dynamics of an area change, the 
ability to change access point settings, such as output transmit power, without physical 
intervention is beneﬁ cial.
Advanced Security Options
Compared to access points used in the SOHO environment, enterprise access points typi-
cally have more advanced security features. In addition to IEEE 802.11i, WPA/WPA 2.0, 
passphrase, and IEEE 802.1X, features such as a built-in user database for local Remote 
Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) authentication are also included. As dis-
cussed later in this chapter, local RADIUS authentication allows small to medium-sized 

74
Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
businesses to provide their own advanced authentication features without the need of external 
RADIUS authentication services. This reduces costs and lowers administration overhead.
RADIUS is just one example of the more advanced security features available in 
enterprise-level access points. Another advanced security feature that may be available is 
some level of a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS). A WIPS will help determine 
and have the potential to mitigate certain levels of wireless intrusions or attacks on the net-
work. One example is the detection of a rogue (unknown) access point. Advanced security 
features are discussed in more detail in Chapter 9, “Wireless LAN Security Basics.”
Some other conﬁ guration options available for one model of enterprise access point are 
shown in Figure 3.6.

a web browser
Multiple Operation Modes
In addition to the features we’ve just discussed, enterprise access points typically have sev-
eral operation modes. These modes are:
Root Access Point Mode—the most common conﬁ guration  What some refer to as root 
access point mode is typically the default operation mode in which an enterprise-grade access 
point is set. Root access point mode involves connecting the access point to a distribution 
system (DS) such as an Ethernet segment, wireless distribution system (WDS), or network 

The Wireless Access Point
75
infrastructure. This allows computers and other devices to connect to the access point and 
use network resources based on the assigned permissions of the user, computer, or device.
Wireless Bridge Mode—for connecting LANs together  This conﬁ guration allows an 
access point to be set in bridge mode for wireless point-to-point or point-to-multipoint 
conﬁ gurations connecting two or more LANs together. Beneﬁ ts of using wireless access 
points to bridge LANs together include cost savings and high data transfer rates compared 
to some other connectivity options.
Wireless Repeater Mode—to extend the radio frequency cell  An access point conﬁ gured 
in wireless repeater mode can act to extend the radio frequency cell. This allows computers 
and devices outside the radio hearing range to connect to the network and access network 
resources via the wireless repeater.
Access point configuration methods
Enterprise access points can commonly be conﬁ gured or “staged” two different ways:
Graphical User Interface (GUI) Conﬁ guration  Enterprise access points can be conﬁ gured 
using a GUI conﬁ guration from a web browser using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). This is a convenient way to conﬁ gure and 
change settings on the access point using a common graphical interface tool. If the access 
point is conﬁ gured using a wireless connection, using the HTTPS protocol is recommended 
for security at a minimum.
Command-Line Interface (CLI) Conﬁ guration  Most enterprise-grade access points have 
command-line interface (CLI) capabilities to allow extensive and detailed conﬁ guration 
of the device. In some cases, the CLI command set provides higher-level commands that 
allow an administrator to perform additional conﬁ guration tasks that aren’t available using 
the browser method. This allows consistency in conﬁ guring other network infrastructure 
devices because many manufacturers share common commands among devices. CLI capa-
bilities vary depending on the manufacturer, but most enterprise models have an extensive 
set of commands. 
Controller-Based Access Points
Controller-based access points differ from autonomous access points in that they are used 
with wireless LAN controllers and not as standalone devices. (As discussed in the previous 
section, an autonomous access point is a self-contained unit that has all the intelligence 
needed to provide computer and device access to a wireless network.) Controller-based 
access points have shifted much of the intelligence to the wireless LAN controller. Since a 
controller-based access point contains less intelligence than an autonomous access point, 
the cost of a controller-based access point can be signiﬁ cantly lower.
Controller-based access points are centrally managed from the wireless LAN controller. 
Depending on the manufacturer, they may have a more extensive feature set than autono-
mous access points, while also including many of the features of those devices. One of these 

76
Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
features is Layer 3 VPN connectivity for computers and other devices. Figure 3.7 shows a 
typical controller-based access point.
F I G U R E  3 .7   Aruba Dual-Radio 802.11a/n + 802.11b/g/n using three antennas
Cooperative Access Points
Cooperative access point technology provides an alternative for deploying wireless local 
area network infrastructures. Cooperative networks are sometimes referred to as a “con-
trollerless architecture,” because the intelligence has been pushed back out to or distributed 
to the access point edge, similar to that of the autonomous access point but with much 
more intelligence and capabilities. The access points are managed through a “cloud” soft-
ware conﬁ guration tool, eliminating the need for a hardware controller. This software con-
trol can be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection, assuming the user has 
appropriate permissions. Some manufacturers also have “software appliances,” eliminating 
the reliance on the cloud server. Many if not all of the beneﬁ ts, features, and advantages 
available with the wireless LAN controller architecture are also available in the cooperative 
or controllerless architecture and are explained later in this chapter. Figure 3.8 shows an 
example of cooperative access points.
Cooperative access points provide all the beneﬁ ts and features of a wireless LAN con-
troller solution without the need and extra expense of a hardware controller. This technol-
ogy is scalable and performs well without relying on a “tunnel” to be built from the access 
point to a controller. This distributed intelligence allows the cooperative access point to 
make decisions about how frames traverse both the wired and wireless network. 
Some manufacturers of controller-based solutions provide a variant of the cooperative 
technology by allowing autonomous access points to be “adoptable” by a controller in a 
large enterprise environment. These access points are then site survivable, meaning they 
will still be able to function standalone should connectivity with the controller be tempo-
rarily lost. The description of this technology includes the term “adaptive access point.”

Wireless Mesh
Wireless mesh networking continues to grow at a steady pace. The concept of mesh net-
working has been in existence for many years. In a full mesh network, all nodes connect 
together with at least two paths for every node. This allows for reliable communication in 
the event of a device or path failure.
Wireless mesh networking is popular in the outdoor market. Some examples where wire-
less mesh networks are currently utilized are:

Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
Most outdoor mesh infrastructure devices provide the highest levels of wireless security 
and are usually inside a rugged weatherproof enclosure for protection from the elements.
Currently many wireless LAN manufacturers use proprietary mechanisms and protocols 
for wireless mesh networking. IEEE 802.11s is an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 stan-
dard to include wireless mesh networking that was ratiﬁ ed in 2011. Many enterprise-grade 
access points have the ability to operate in mesh mode, whereas others have a dedicated 
mesh function. 
Wireless mesh networking for indoor deployments is still in the testing phase. Some 
manufacturers recommend using both unlicensed bands for mesh operation. One com-
mon solution is to use the 2.4 GHz ISM band for device access and the 5 GHz UNII band 
for mesh device connectivity. The use of a third radio may be an option in some cases. 
Mesh can also be used in the event of Ethernet loss to an access point. Some coopera-
tive access points are able to automatically mesh together when they suffer an Ethernet 
loss. They typically by default support clients in both bands but can mesh in 5 GHz if an 
Ethernet connection fails. Figure 3.9 illustrates mesh access points connected to a wired 
infrastructure.

Wireless LAN Routers

Wireless LAN Routers
Wireless LAN routers can be deﬁ ned differently depending on the application. In the 
SOHO or home market, a wireless LAN router is also known as a wireless broadband 
router. The CWNP program and associated material refer to these devices as wireless resi-
dential gateways. In the enterprise environment, a wireless LAN router has similar func-
tionality plus extended features and is known as a wireless VPN router.
Wireless Residential Gateway
SOHO or home broadband routers (also known as wireless residential gateways) are usu-
ally equipped with an Internet port, several ports for Ethernet switches, and a wireless 
access point. These routers are conﬁ gured through a web browser using either the HTTP 
or HTTPS protocols. Conﬁ guration of the devices is fairly simple for the novice user using 
a web browser via a built-in web server. In most cases, a broadband wireless router con-
nects to either a cable modem or a digital subscriber line (DSL) connection available from 
an Internet service provider (ISP). In this conﬁ guration, a router is able to accept wired and 
wireless connections for computers and other devices, providing them access to the LAN or 
the Internet. Some of the features of a broadband router include:

Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
Wireless Branch Router
A wireless branch router can be used to extend a corporate network to a remote location 
such as a home, conference room, or branch ofﬁ ce through a secure connection using a 
WAN or the Internet. This type of device typically has three interfaces available:



Wireless branch routers are usually compact and lightweight, making them easy for sales 
representatives and other corporate employees to travel with. They also have a more exten-
sive feature set than wireless broadband routers, including Layer 3 VPN tunnels between 
devices and the router on each side that acts as a VPN endpoint or pass-through. Other

Wireless Bridges
Wireless bridges connect two or more wired LANs together. As discussed in Chapter 2, 
typically there are two conﬁ gurations for wireless bridges: point-to-point or point-to-
multipoint. A wireless bridge is a dedicated device that functions in much the same way 

Wireless Repeaters 
81
as an access point in bridge mode. Wireless bridges have many of the same features as 
enterprise access points, including removable antennas and selectable power levels.
Connecting locations together using wireless bridging has many beneﬁ ts, including 
fast installation, cost savings, and high data transfer rates. Depending on the 
circumstances, a wireless bridge can be installed in as little as one day. Cost savings 
can be enormous compared to installing and maintaining a physical wired connec-
tion between locations, whether it is copper, ﬁ ber optics, or a leased line from a service 
provider.
Wireless bridges can work in either the 2.4 GHz ISM or 5 GHz UNII band. The connec-
tion can span long distances, so it is important to take security and environmental condi-
tions into consideration as well as the proper antenna selection.
Figure 3.12 illustrates wireless bridges connecting two LANs.
F I G U R E 3 .12  Wireless bridges connecting two LANs
LAN 1
LAN 2
When LANs are connected using wireless bridges, the bridges must 
be set to the same RF channel and have the same SSID.
Wireless Repeaters
Wireless repeaters are used to extend the radio frequency cell. In a wired Ethernet network, 
repeaters function at Layer 1 of the OSI model to extend the Ethernet segment. An Ethernet 
repeater lacks intelligence—that is, it cannot determine data trafﬁ c types and simply passes 

82
Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
all data trafﬁ c across the device. Since wireless infrastructure devices including repeaters 
are Layer 2 devices, they have more intelligence than Ethernet repeaters.
Just as an Ethernet segment has a maximum distance for successful data transmis-
sion, wireless LANs do as well. This distance depends on several factors, including the 
transmit power of the access point and the gain of the antenna. Like an access point, the 
wireless client device is also a transmitter and a receiver and will have a radio 
frequency range limited by the transmit power and gain of the antenna. A wireless 
repeater provides the capability for computers and other devices to connect to a wireless 
LAN even when outside the normal hearing range of the access point connected to the 
network. Figure 3.13 illustrates how a wireless repeater can extend the range of a wire-
less network.
F I G U R E 3 .13  A wireless repeater extends the range of a wireless network.
Layer 2 switch
Access Point
Repeater
Wireless client
As illustrated, the wireless client is not within hearing range of the access point, so 
adequate communication is not possible between these devices. In order for wireless LAN 
devices to communicate effectively with an access point, the transmitter must be able to 
hear the receiver, and the receiver must be able to hear the transmitter. A wireless repeater 
will allow this communication to occur in the case where the wireless client is outside the 
radio frequency cell or basic service area (BSA) of the access point. The wireless client will 
send information or frames to the repeater and the repeater will forward them to the access 
point, and vice versa. The downside of this conﬁ guration is that it will reduce the overall 
throughput as described. The wireless repeater may be named differently by the manufac-
turer and include the term wireless range extender.

Wireless LAN Controllers
83
Using Wireless Repeaters Reduces Throughput
Before using a wireless repeater, consider whether it would be the best solution. 
Since wireless LANs are half duplex (two-way communication but only one way at 
a time), data throughput will suffer when using repeaters. Every time the data tra-
verses a wireless link using the same frequency, the data throughput is reduced by 
about 50 percent. If a physical wired connection is available, it should be used for 
an access point connection rather than a wireless repeater. For security purposes, 
the Ethernet port on a wireless repeater should be disabled since it is not con-
nected to an infrastructure.
Wireless LAN Controllers
Wireless LAN controllers are a main component in many wireless LAN deployments. 
Wireless LAN controllers range from branch ofﬁ ce models with a few controller-based 
access points to large-scale enterprise devices with hundreds or even thousands of 
controller-based access points. The branch ofﬁ ce models are typically used in remote 
ofﬁ ce installations or small/medium business (SMB) applications with a limited number of 
access points. This section discusses some of the many beneﬁ ts, features, and advantages

Centralized Administration
A wireless LAN controller with centralized administration gives an administrator complete 
control over the wireless network from a single location. Unlike autonomous access points 
that require intervention at each device for conﬁ guration, a wireless LAN controller can be 
a “one-stop shop” for conﬁ guration and management of the wireless network. A wireless 
network management system (WNMS) can be used as a centralized tool to manage autono-
mous access points. A WNMS be used to help scale the autonomous access point architec-
ture but is not required.
Controller-Based Access Points
The beneﬁ ts of controller-based access points are similar to those of autonomous access 
points, including radio frequency management, security, and quality of service. But 
controller-based access points can cost less than autonomous access points, and very little 
or no information is contained within the devices. Controller-based access points are 
PoE-capable for ease of deployment in either mid-sized or large organizations.
Virtual LAN 
According to the IEEE 802.1Q standard, virtual local area networks (VLANs) deﬁ ne 
broadcast domains in a Layer 2 network by inserting VLAN membership information 
into Ethernet frames. Layer 2 Ethernet switches can create broadcast domains based on 
how the switch is conﬁ gured by using VLAN technology. This allows an administrator 
to separate physical ports into logical networks to organize trafﬁ c according to the use 
of the VLAN for security proﬁ les, QoS, or other applications. The concept of a Layer 2 
wired VLAN is extended to IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. Wireless LAN controllers have 
the ability to conﬁ gure broadcast domains and segregate broadcast and multicast trafﬁ c 
between VLANs.
Power over Ethernet Capability
Wireless LAN controllers support Power over Ethernet (PoE), allowing direct current volt-
age and computer data to be sent over the same cable. Details of PoE are discussed later in 
this chapter in the section “Power over Ethernet.”

Wireless LAN Controllers

Improved Device Roaming
Fast seamless Layer 2 and Layer 3 roaming between access points is another common fea-
ture of wireless LAN controllers. This feature is beneﬁ cial in order for computers and other 
wireless devices connected to the wireless LAN to maintain a connection while physically 
moving throughout the wireless network. As you learned in Chapter 2, the IEEE 802.11r 
amendment speciﬁ es fast transition (FT) and the IEEE 802.11k helps with this function-
ality. Roaming is more often than not an enterprise requirement and exists in very few 
SOHO deployments.
Wireless Profiles
A wireless LAN controller can give network administrators the ability to create a variety 
of conﬁ guration proﬁ les. These proﬁ les can work in conjunction with VLANs to allow or 
deny access based on requirements for the computer, device, or user access. Proﬁ les can be 
conﬁ gured for various situations, including different SSIDs for guest, corporate, and voice 
networks, security conﬁ gurations, and QoS support. This can also be accomplished with a 
WNMS for controllerless or cooperative deployments.
Using profiles, you can allow legacy devices that may be limited to 
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) to be located on a separate VLAN 
without compromising the security of the entire network.
Advanced Security Features
Like autonomous access points, wireless LAN controllers will also provide advanced secu-
rity options. Wireless LAN controllers will include security options based on IEEE 802.11i 
and WPA/WPA 2.0, with both passphrase and enterprise conﬁ guration capabilities.
Captive Portal
Captive portal capability is a common feature in wireless LAN controllers and cooperative-
based systems. A captive portal will intercept a user’s attempt to access the network by 
redirecting them to a web page for authorization. This web page may request account cre-
dentials, payment information from a user, or a simple agreement to terms and conditions 
before granting access to the wireless network. One common example where you will see 
a captive portal is in a paid or free wireless hotspot. The captive portal can be hosted by 
an outside service provider, an autonomous access point, or a wireless controller, and in a 
cooperative system on the access point.

Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
Built-in RADIUS Services
Another common feature of wireless LAN controllers and cooperative-based systems is 
RADIUS services for 802.1X/EAP authentication, which is supported by WPA and WPA 
2.0. Built-in RADIUS allows a network administrator to utilize the most advanced security 
features available today to secure the wireless network. Built-in RADIUS server databases 
typically have a limited number of users that can be created in the user database, which 
means that built-in RADIUS is a good solution for SMB or remote ofﬁ ce locations but not 
for very large organizations. Larger networks can use external RADIUS services for scal-
ability. See www.gnu.org/software/radius for more about this server.
Site Survey Tools
Predictive site survey tools assist in placement of access points and other infrastructure 
devices. These tools are sometimes a feature of a wireless LAN controller. Performing a 
predictive site survey will assist in planning to determine coverage and capacity for data 
and voice for both indoor and outdoor deployments.
Aerohive provides a free online wireless network planning tool with an auto-placement 
feature. See www.aerohive.com/planner for more information and to access this free tool.
Radio Frequency Spectrum Management
Keeping an eye on the radio frequency (RF) environment is another responsibility of the 
wireless network administrator. RF spectrum management consists of adjusting RF param-
eters such as the channel (frequency) and the RF transmit power after deployment. This 
allows the network to adapt to changes in the environment and assist in the event of hard-
ware failures.
Firewall
An integrated stateful ﬁ rewall feature helps protect a network from unauthorized Internet 
trafﬁ c but still allows authorized trafﬁ c. Firewalls can be hardware based, software based, 
or a combination of the two. Stateful ﬁ rewalls, which keep records of all connections 
passing through the ﬁ rewall, help protect against broadcast storms, rogue DHCP server 
attacks, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning, and other potential attacks against 
the wireless LAN.
Quality of Service
Quality of service features help time-critical applications such as voice and video communi-
cations minimize latency and allow for trafﬁ c prioritization. With the continual expansion 
of voice and video technology in the wireless LAN arena, QoS is becoming an increasingly 
important component in the wireless network.

Wireless LAN Controllers
87
Redundancy
Redundancy allows for fault-tolerant deployments and provides uninterrupted access in 
the event an access point or wireless LAN controller fails. Complete redundancy will pre-
vent a major outage caused by hardware failure for mission-critical or other deployments. 
Coverage is maintained by alternating access points between the redundant devices, mini-
mizing interruption for user access in the event of a hardware failure.
Wireless Intrusion Prevention System
A wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) monitors all activity across the wireless 
network for potential intrusion and malicious activities. A WIPS can take appropriate 
action to mitigate an attack based on the type of intrusion.
Direct and Distributed AP Connectivity
Connecting access points that are not directly plugged into a port on the wireless LAN 
controller is a feature known as distributed AP connectivity and is beneﬁ cial in large-scale 
deployments. Most manufacturers support distributed AP connectivity. Direct AP 
connectivity is deﬁ ned as a direct connection to ports on the switch. A typical device with 
distributed connectivity is shown in Figure 3.14.
F I G U R E 3 .14  Meru MC 5000 large-scale enterprise wireless LAN controller
Layer 2 and Layer 3 AP Connectivity
Early wireless network implementations were built with dedicated Layer 2 connectivity, 
which meant limited wireless mobility. Layer 2 roaming occurs when a computer or other 
wireless device moves out of the radio cell of the currently connected access point and con-
nects to a different AP maintaining Layer 2 connectivity.

88 
Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
As wireless networking technology evolved, so did the need for Layer 3 connectivity and 
roaming. IP addresses are logical Layer 3 addresses that identify devices on a network. All 
IP devices on the same network or subnet are considered to be in the same IP boundary. 
Layer 3 roaming occurs when a client moves to an AP that covers a different IP subnet. 
After roaming, the client will no longer have a valid IP address from the original subnet 
and the device will be issued an IP address from the new subnet while maintaining Layer 3 
connectivity. Figure 3.15 illustrates Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity.

Distributed and Centralized Data Forwarding
Wireless LAN controller solutions consist of two common types of architectures: cen-
tralized and distributed. Early WLAN controller solutions supported the centralized 
architecture, which is also known as split-MAC architecture. This design separated the 
intelligence from the access point and placed it into the wireless controller to allow for 
centralized management and control of the wireless network. The access point for the 
most part was just a radio and antenna, and trafﬁ c decisions were sent to the controller 
through an Ethernet cable. This technique is also known as centralized data forwarding. 
Depending on where the controller was placed, it could cause bottlenecks and other issues 
in the case of an overloaded or poorly designed network infrastructure. With the data 
rates possible with IEEE 802.11n, the aggregate throughput could be too much for the net-
work to handle, resulting in poor performance.
Distributed data forwarding reduces the amount of infrastructure trafﬁ c because the 
controller-based access point is able to make more decisions, taking some of the load away 

Power over Ethernet
89
from the wireless controller. Moving some of the intelligence back to the edge (the wireless 
access point) minimizes the bottlenecks and other potential issues such as latency. This is 
also true in a cooperative or controllerless architecture, thus eliminating the need for the 
data to be sent to the controller for handling. Many wireless LAN equipment manufactur-
ers now support both the centralized and distributed WLAN architectures.
Power over Ethernet
Power over Ethernet (PoE) sends direct current (DC) voltage and computer data over the 
same Ethernet cable, enabling a device to receive DC power and computer data simultane-
ously. This eliminates the need for an external alternating current (AC) power source to 
be near the Ethernet device. Power over Ethernet now consists of two ratiﬁ ed amendments 
to the IEEE 802.3 standard. It is deﬁ ned in 802.3-2005 Clause 33, also known as IEEE 
802.3af, and IEEE 802.3at, sometimes called PoE+. These amendments deﬁ ne the speci-
ﬁ cations for devices used in wired or wireless networking to receive DC power from the 
Ethernet connection without the need for an external DC power source.
An Ethernet cable has four copper wire pairs or eight copper wires. Depending on the 
technology in use, either two or all four wired pairs may be used to carry data trafﬁ c. 
Figure 3.16 shows an example of a standard Ethernet cable pin assignment.
The PoE amendments to the Ethernet standard allow electrical power to be supplied 
in one of two ways, either over the same wired pairs that carry computer data or over the 
pairs that do not carry data. 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T (Fast Ethernet) implementations 
use only two wired pairs (four wires) to carry data. 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet) may 
use all four pairs (eight wires) to carry computer data. The standard deﬁ nes which wire 
pairs are allowed to carry the DC power based on whether the network is 10BASE-T, 
100BASE-T, or 1000BASE-T and whether the power is sourced from an endpoint or mid-
span injector. Both midspan and endpoint are explained later in this chapter.

Chapter 3  Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices
The nominal voltage for PoE is 48 VDC, but the amendments allow for a range of 44 
to 57 VDC at the power source. The PoE amendments address two types of devices: power 
sourcing equipment (PSE), the source of the DC power, and the powered device (PD), the 
receiver of the DC power.
Before PoE was standardized, some manufacturers used proprietary 
implementations. These solutions used various voltages, polarities, and 
pin assignments and may still be in the market today. I recommend 
that you verify PoE standard compliance before using this technology 
to prevent potential hardware or device failures.
The IEEE 802.3-2005 Clause 33 (802.3af) amendment was released in 2003 and 
allocates 15.4 watts (W) of power per port maximum. This amendment has been incor-
porated into the IEEE 802.3-2008 standard. The IEEE 802.3at amendment, also known 
as PoE+, was released in 2009 and includes changes to add to the capabilities of the 
IEEE 802.3-2008 standard with higher power levels and improved power management 
information. IEEE 802.3at allows for 25.5 W of power per port maximum, a 60 per-
cent increase over IEEE 802.3af. IEEE 802.3af PoE will work with access points from 
all manufacturers of enterprise-grade IEEE 802.11n access points. Using IEEE 802.3af 
will make it easier for organizations to transition from older model access points to the 
newer 802.11n technology, which will improve their client service and provide overall 
better performance without having to immediately upgrade their PoE infrastructure to 
IEEE 802.3at.
Power Sourcing Equipment 
The power sourcing equipment (PSE) is the device that supplies the DC voltage to the end 
devices that receive the DC power. The DC voltage (power) can be delivered to the device in 
one of two ways:


An endpoint device (usually a wireless LAN controller or an Ethernet switch) delivers 
DC power directly over the same wire pairs that carry data or over the unused wire 
pairs.


A midspan device (usually a single port or multiple port injector) injects DC power into 
the Ethernet cable over the unused wire pairs or over the data pairs, depending on the 
version of the standard. 
Powered Device
The powered device (PD) is deﬁ ned as the device receiving DC power, such as a wireless 
access point, wireless bridge, IP camera, IP phone, and so on. The IEEE 802.3 standard 

Power over Ethernet
91
deﬁ nes the maximum cable length of an Ethernet cable to be 328' or 100 m. Because of line 
loss, the standard speciﬁ es less maximum power than what is available at the port. Table 
3.1 shows the maximum power allowed for both the PSE and the PD.

Powered Device Classifications
Equipment manufacturers have the option of deﬁ ning a classiﬁ cation signature. This clas-
siﬁ cation signature determines the maximum amount of power a device requires, thereby 
allowing the PSE to better manage the amount of power delivered to a speciﬁ c port. The 
PoE standard makes ﬁ ve classes of powered device available (class 0 through class 4). Table 
3.2 shows the available classes and the amount power in watts for each class for IEEE 
802.3-2005 clause 33 (802.3af) devices.

Benefits of PoE
There are many beneﬁ ts to using devices that support PoE, including cost savings and con-
venience. As mentioned in the previous section, the IEEE 802.3 Standard (Ethernet) speci-
ﬁ es a maximum distance of 100 m or 328' for unshielded twisted pair (UTP) Category 5 
(CAT5) Ethernet cable. Power over Ethernet enables a PoE device to receive DC power and 
computer data at this distance without the need for electrical power at the point where the 
device is installed or located. This can amount to a large cost savings if a voltage source is 
not available where the device is located, because there is no need to install electrical power 
at that point.
Midspan Devices
Midspan devices inject the required DC voltage (48V nominal) into the Ethernet cable 
allowing the AP, bridge, or other powered device to receive electrical power and computer 
data. There are two types of midspan device—single-port injectors and multiport injectors. 
A single-port injector supplies power to a single device. This is useful in an implementation 
that may have only a few PoE devices. A single-port injector is an in-line device that adds 
DC power to the Ethernet cable. A multiport injector can supply DC power to many devices 
simultaneously. A multiport injector is an in-line device that functions like a patch panel. 
Two ports on this device are required to supply both DC power and computer data to a 
single powered device such as an access point, bridge, or IP camera. Therefore, a 24-port 
injector will allow connectivity for only 12 devices.

Exam Essentials
93
Endpoint Devices
Endpoint devices supply DC power and computer data directly at the Ethernet port rather 
than relying on an intermediate device to supply the power. Wireless LAN controllers and 
Ethernet switches are examples of endpoint devices. A beneﬁ t of endpoint PoE is that no 
intermediate adapter to inject power is necessary. Figure 3.18 shows an example of an end-
point PoE device.

Summary
This chapter discussed wireless LAN infrastructure devices, which are commonly used 
to provide wireless connectivity to a network for computers and other wireless devices. 
These devices include the access point—an integral part of the wireless LAN—available 
as a self-contained intelligent (autonomous) device, a controller-based device for use with 
wireless LAN controllers, or a cooperative AP providing user access to network resources. 
Other infrastructure devices include wireless LAN routers for SOHO or home use, wire-
less bridges for connecting LANs together, and wireless repeaters for extending the RF cell. 
This chapter explained some of the features, beneﬁ ts, and applications of these infrastruc-
ture devices. Finally, the chapter covered the two Power over Ethernet (PoE) amendments

 Client utility software and drivers

Client devices are often thought of as computers—either 
desktop or notebook—connected to a computer network. 
However, there are many other devices, both wired and wire-
less, that can connect to a network. Wireless LAN client devices include various types of 
computers, tablets, smart phones, scanners, print servers, cameras, and other devices that 
are used to send data across the network. This chapter will look at the features of various 
wireless LAN client adapter types and the software for conﬁ guration and management of 
these devices. 
Devices that connect to wireless networks use various types of adapters. Which adapter 
is used depends on the device that it connects to. You can connect wireless adapters to such 
devices as a notebook computer, tablet, desktop computer, or barcode scanner. Wireless 
LAN adapters are available in various types, both external and internal to the device. 
External adapters will connect to an available interface in the device such as a USB port 
or card slot. Examples of external adapter types are PCMCIA, ExpressCard, USB, and 
CompactFlash (CF).
Some devices use internal adapters that may require some level of disassembly or 
removal of a cover panel prior to the installation. Examples of internal adapter types are 
PCI, Mini-PCI, Full Mini-PCIe, and Half Mini PCIe.
Wireless LAN client adapters differ from other networking adapters (such as Ethernet 
adapters) because they contain radio hardware and use radio frequency (RF) to send the 
computer data over the air. Chapter 6, “Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN 
Technology,” will discuss RF fundamentals in more detail. A wireless LAN design should 
be partly based on the needs of the client applications, client device types to be supported, 
and the environment where they will be used.
Radio Hardware Used with Wireless 
LAN Technology
Wireless LAN client devices require some type of radio hardware or chipset to send the digi-
tal data (all the ones and zeros) across the air using radio frequency. It is important to under-
stand that based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, every addressable unit used in a wireless LAN 
is considered a station (STA). This includes both client devices that connect to the network 
and wireless access points that allow devices to connect to and use network resources.

PCMCIA
101
Another point to consider is that with the recent advancements in wireless LAN technol-
ogy, including the release of the IEEE 802.11n amendment, client device selection will need 
to be carefully considered. Although it is beneﬁ cial to use 802.11n-capable client devices 
along with the newer 802.11n multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) access points, 
radio technology used in 802.11a/b/g devices may beneﬁ t from MIMO technology as well. 
Selecting the correct wireless adapter will allow a user to take advantage of the newest 
wireless LAN technology available.
Many organizations now have to deal with the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) issue. 
This is a trend in which employees bring their own personal electronic wireless devices such 
as tablets and Wi-Fi–enabled smart phones to the ofﬁ ce or place of business. These devices 
will then have access to company resources, including email services, ﬁ le servers, computer 
data, and printers. This may create problems for technical support and security issues. 
BYOD is forcing organizations to address this in corporate policies.
PCMCIA
PCMCIA technology was developed in the early 1990s because the portable computer 
industry demanded smaller, lighter, and more mobile technology. The international stan-
dards organization developed to promote the growth of such technology is the Personal 
Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA). With the advancements 
in computer device technology, PCMCIA adapters are becoming less popular. In the early 
days of standards-based wireless LAN technology, it was common for a device such as a 
notebook computer to have an interface or a “slot” that allowed for the use of a PCMCIA 
adapter. With the advancements in technology, it is much less common to ﬁ nd a computer 
or device that supports this type of adapter than it was a few years ago. Most portable 
devices now use either a built-in wireless networking adapter or a USB adapter; both are 
discussed in this chapter.
Features of PCMCIA Cards
The PCMCIA standard addressed three types of cards—Type I, Type II, and Type III. 
These cards are named after the PCMCIA organization that promoted this card technol-
ogy and was responsible for the standards. You might also see the term PC Card used to 
describe these cards; this refers to the physical card or peripheral. All three types are the 
same width and length and have a 68-pin connector.
Figure 4.1 shows an example of a PCMCIA card that allows a computer to connect to a 
wireless network. 
The only difference among the three types of cards is their thickness. Table 4.1 lists the 
different thicknesses and common uses of the card types.

According to the ExpressCard website, “the PCMCIA Association has 
been dissolved and the San Jose office closed. All activities and 
Standards, including the ExpressCard Standard and PC Card Standard, 
will be managed going forward by the USB Implementer’s Forum.” 
For additional information on this and other details, visit the USB 
Implementers Forum, Inc. website at www.usb.org.
Even with the advancements in this technology, there are still some devices in the mar-
ketplace that support PCMCIA adapters, and PCMCIA is included in the CWTS exam 
objectives. For that reason we’ll next look at some details of its conﬁ guration.

PCMCIA

Some older wireless access points used PCMCIA cards as their radios 
before radios were integrated into the access point and before the 
Mini-PCI card was used in access points.
Installation and Configuration of PCMCIA Cards
Installation of a PCMCIA card is a fairly simple process. The ﬁ rst consideration is to 
verify the physical characteristics of the card, such as the type (Type I, II, or III) and device 
in which it will be used—a notebook computer, for example. The card and the host device 
must be physically compatible with each other to ensure correct operation.
Another consideration is the device driver. A device driver is software required for a 
component such as a PCMCIA card to communicate with the computer or device 
operating system. The installer should have the latest version of the device driver accessible. 
The adapter usually comes with an installation CD that contains the device driver. It is 
best to follow the manufacturer’s installation recommendations for the installation process, 
which may involve updating the driver from the manufacturer’s website. 
It is important to verify compatibility and minimum system require-
ments prior to installing any wireless network adapter in a device. 
Refer to the owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website for this 
information.
Configuration Using Installer Software
In many cases, a user will be required to ﬁ rst install a setup software program from the 
card manufacturer. This software will usually load the device driver within the computer 
operating system and install the conﬁ guration utility for the card. 
Configuration Using a Wizard
In some cases, when the PCMCIA card is inserted into the correct interface, the computer 
operating system will automatically install the required device driver. If the operating sys-
tem cannot ﬁ nd the correct driver, the user will be prompted to search the Internet or insert 
a CD or other data source from the manufacturer with the software device driver. Figure 
4.2 shows a wizard that the Microsoft Windows 7 Professional operating system will dis-
play to help load the device driver.

Exercise 4.1 illustrates how a common PCMCIA wireless LAN card will be installed. 
Do not insert the adapter until instructed to do so by the installation program. The manual 
device driver installation process described in Exercise 4.1 for PCMCIA is also applicable 
for other types of adapters explained in this chapter.

Installing a PCMCIA Card 
The following general steps are typical for installation of a PCMCIA wireless LAN 
card. Exact installation steps are speciﬁ c to the manufacturer, and I recommend that 
you follow the manufacturer’s installation instructions. Always read the manufac-
turer’s manual regarding setup and safety before attempting installation.
1. Insert the Setup CD into the CD-ROM drive. The program should start automati-
cally, and a welcome screen may appear.
The graphic shows the welcome screen for the Linksys Wireless-G Notebook

8. Setup is complete. Remove the Setup CD from the drive. 
In some cases, the installation and setup may require the computer to be restarted in order for the adapter to operate correctly. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.
ExpressCard
ExpressCard is a newer generation of PC Card technology. This type of adapter is nar-
rower than its predecessor (the PCMCIA adapter) and is available for newer wireless 
LAN technology, including IEEE 802.11n. Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Intel, and Microsoft 
are some of the PCMCIA member companies responsible for creating the ExpressCard 
standard. This technology is used in a large percentage of notebook computers to add 
new hardware capabilities. The ExpressCard is also used on some wireless LAN con-
trollers and wireless access points to allow the addition of another radio, most often an 
Evolution-Data Optimized (EVDO) card to provide a backhaul for emergency use in 
high-availability roles.
Lower cost, smaller size, and higher performance were the driving forces behind 
ExpressCard technology. Applications include wired and wireless networking and commu-
nications, multimedia, and additional memory storage.
Features of the ExpressCard
The ExpressCard standard is built on the 16-bit and 32-bit PC Card standards. 
ExpressCard modules are available in four types: 34mm, 34mm extended, 54mm, and 

108 
Chapter 4  Wireless LAN Client Devices
54mm extended. The extended modules can be used for external connectors, television 
tuners, and wireless broadband, whereas standard modules will have speciﬁ c function-
ality such as a wireless network adapter. Figure 4.3 shows the four types of available 
ExpressCards.

Users can install or remove an ExpressCard without having to power down the 
computer or device. This technology is known as hot-plug. Hot-plug technology is also 
commonly supported by USB and other adapters.
According to the ExpressCard website, “the PCMCIA Association has been 
dissolved and the San Jose office closed. All activities and Standards, 
including the ExpressCard Standard and PC Card Standard, will be man-
aged going forward by the USB Implementer’s Forum.” For additional 
information on this and other details, visit the USB Implementers Forum, 
Inc. website at www.usb.org.
Installation and Configuration of an ExpressCard
The installation and conﬁ guration steps for an ExpressCard are similar to those for install-
ing a PCMCIA card. (See the earlier section, “Installation and Conﬁ guration of PCMCIA 
Cards.”) Figure 4.4 shows an ExpressCard plugged into a notebook computer.

USB 1.0, USB 1.1, USB 2.0, and 
USB 3.0
Introduced in 1995, the Universal Serial Bus (USB 1.0) standard was designed as a replace-
ment for legacy serial and parallel connections. 
Serial communication is the process of transmitting one data bit at a time. Parallel com-
munication has the capability of transmitting several data bits at a time. Imagine a single-lane 
road compared to a four-lane highway. On a single-lane road, only one car at a time can 
travel, whereas on a four-lane highway, many cars can traverse the same path at the same time. 
USB allows connectivity for various devices that once used serial and parallel data con-
nection ports. These devices include but are not limited to:


Keyboard


Mouse


Digital camera


Printer


Computer networking adapter
USB 1.0 speciﬁ ed data rates from 1.5 Mbps to 12 and was replaced by USB 1.1 in 1998. 
Devices using this version of the standard were more common in the market. 
USB standards are implemented by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). This organi-
zation consists of companies from the computer and electronics industries, including Intel, 
Microsoft, NEC, and HP.

110 
Chapter 4  Wireless LAN Client Devices
The USB 2.0 speciﬁ cation was released in April 2000. The ﬁ rst revision appeared in 
December 2000, and the standard has been revised several times since. USB 2.0 incorpo-
rates several changes, including connector types. Data rates now allow for a maximum 
speed of up to 480 Mbps (USB 1.0 supported a maximum of 12 Mbps). 
Figure 4.5 shows an example of a USB 2.0 port.
F I G U R E  4 . 5   USB 2.0 port on notebook computer panel
USB 2.0 port
USB 3.0 technology was introduced in early 2010 and is commonly available to the point 
of being included on newer system boards. USB 3.0 devices have faster transfer rates and 
use a wider bandwidth, and they allow multiple logical streams and improved bus use with 
asynchronous readiness notiﬁ cation without polling. USB 3.0 greatly increases the transmis-
sion speed from the 480 Mbps of USB 2.0 up to 4.8 Gbps. This is more than 10 times that 
of the earlier standard, and as a result USB 3.0 is known as “SuperSpeed.” In addition to 
speed, the new USB 3.0 speciﬁ cation addresses improvements to the technology, includ-
ing bandwidth, by using bidirectional data paths, power management, and improved bus 
utilization.
Features of USB
USB uses a standard connector that replaces 9-pin serial, 25-pin parallel, and various other 
connector types. External conﬁ guration allows the user to plug in the USB device and 
power it with a single USB port. The computer operating system will guide the user through 
the device driver installation process. External installation minimizes the need to open up 
a computer case and make adjustments within the computer such as switch or jumper set-
tings. USB also supports hot-swapping of devices, allowing connection and disconnection 
without the need to power down the device or the computer. In some cases, USB allows for 
power to be delivered to the peripheral device, eliminating the need for an external power 
supply. Fewer and fewer devices are being built with PC card or ExpressCard interfaces and 
most use only USB ports for adding peripheral devices.

dards, visit the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) at www.usb.org.

Peripheral Component Interconnect
PCI is the acronym for Peripheral Component Interconnect, a standard for computer inter-
face cards that was developed by Intel. A PCI card is inserted into a slot in the main board 
or motherboard of a desktop computer, allowing for the attachment of peripheral devices. 
Installing a PCI card may require basic tools such as a screwdriver, and the installer usu-
ally will need to remove the cover from the desktop computer case. Figure 4.6 shows an 
example of an IEEE 802.11 wireless PCI card.

Peripheral Component Interconnect 
113
F I G U R E  4 .6   Netgear WG311T IEEE 802.11g wireless PCI adapter
Features of PCI
A PCI adapter connects to what is known as a data bus in a desktop computer. In basic 
terms, a data bus allows connection of devices to the computer’s processor or “brain.” 
In the early days of personal computers, many devices used a data bus. These devices 
included video, hard disks, serial ports, Ethernet adapters, and parallel ports for print-
ers. These interfaces connected to what is known as an Industry Standard Architecture 
(ISA) bus.
Modern computers have integrated many of these interfaces directly into the mother-
board, system board, or main board. As PC technology evolved, so did the data bus archi-
tecture, going to 32-bit and now 64-bit bus. Wireless networks are no stranger to PCI. Even 
though wireless is often thought of as portable or mobile, in many cases stationary desktop 
computers can utilize wireless LAN connectivity through the use of wireless PCI interface 
cards.
PCI-SIG (Peripheral Component Interconnect–Special Interest Group) is 
the industry organization for development and management of the PCI 
standards. For additional information, visit www.pcisig.com.
Installation and Configuration of PCI Cards
Back in 1995, Microsoft introduced a feature in the Windows 95 operating system called Plug 
and Play (PnP). This new feature accelerated the interest in PCI. PnP made installing a PCI

Mini-PCI, Mini-PCIe, and Half 
Mini-PCIe 
Mini-PCI is a variation of the PCI standard, designed for laptops and other small-footprint 
computer systems. One common example of a Mini-PCI card is the IEEE 802.11 Mini-PCI 
adapter shown in Figure 4.7.
F I G U R E  4 .7   IEEE 802.11 Mini-PCI adapter
Mini-PCI cards are common in many devices, such as Fast Ethernet networks, 
Bluetooth, modems, hard drive controllers, and wireless LANs. In the wireless world, 
Mini-PCI cards are used in access points and client devices such as laptop or notebook 
computers.
Mini-PCI Express (Mini-PCIe) cards are a replacement for the Mini-PCI card and are 
based on PCI Express.
Many notebook and portable computers with built-in wireless LAN use 
either Mini-PCI or Mini-PCIe or now Half Mini-PCIe cards for wireless 
IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN connectivity.

Mini-PCI, Mini-PCIe, and Half Mini-PCIe   
117
Features of Mini-PCI, Mini-PCIe, and Half 
Mini-PCIe Cards
Mini-PCI cards are available in three types; Type I, Type II, and Type III. Types I and II use 
a 100-pin stacking connector. Type III cards use a 124-pin edge connector. Type II cards 
have RJ11 and RJ45 connectors for telephone and Ethernet network connections. These 
cards are commonly located at the edge of the computer or docking station so that the con-
nectors can be mounted for external access, such as to a modem or computer network.
Mini-PCIe cards are 30mm ¥ 56mm and have a 52-pin edge connector, consisting of 
two staggered rows on a 0.8mm pitch. These cards are 1.0mm thick excluding components. 
Table 4.2 summarizes the features of Mini-PCI and Mini-PCIe cards.
The Half Mini-PCIe cards are 30mm ¥ 31.90mm. The main difference between this 
card and the Mini-PCIe card mentioned earlier is the length. The length of this new form 
factor is about half of the Mini-PCIe card.
With the introduction of the Half Mini-PCIe card form factor, the Mini-
PCIe card is now called the Full Mini-PCIe card.

Replacing a Full Mini-PCIe with Half Mini-PCIe Adapter
Upgrading an IEEE 802.11g wireless Full Mini-PCIe card to a newer IEEE 802.11n 
Half-Mini PCIe card may require the use of a special adapter or bracket. Keep in 
mind that the Half Mini-PCIe card is about half the length of the full card, and you 
may not be able to install the card securely. Therefore, you may need to purchase 
a special bracket in order for the new Half Mini-PCIe card to be securely mounted 
in the notebook computer or other device where the card is to be installed.
Additional Adapter Types
The following section describes some additional wireless radios and adapters. These adapt-
ers are not as common as some of the others mentioned earlier in this chapter but are still 
available for purchase and are used with networking devices. The following adapters were 
originally designed as memory storage cards but had a wireless network technology added 
to them:

Installation and Configuration of a CF Card
Installing a CF IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN card differs from some of the previous instal-
lation examples. For example, you may need to connect a handheld personal computer 
running a Microsoft operating system (Pocket PC) or personal digital assistant (PDA) to 
another computer in order to complete the installation process. Always follow the manufac-
turer’s setup instructions for installing the speciﬁ c card.

Secure Digital  
121
Secure Digital 
Like the CompactFlash card, Secure Digital (SD) was designed as a ﬂ ash memory storage 
device with storage capacities from 8 MB to 4 GB. The SD memory card was a joint ven-
ture among SanDisk, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1999.
Even though the SD card was designed as to provide ﬂ ash memory, the slot will allow 
for connection of other devices such as cameras, global positioning system (GPS) units, FM 
radios, TV tuners, Ethernet networks, and of course wireless LANs. In this format the SD 
card is known as Secure Digital Input Output (SDIO). This card is designed to provide 
high-speed data I/O with low power consumption for mobile electronic devices. Figure 4.10 
is an example of an SDIO wireless LAN adapter.

Connect the Pocket PC or PDA to the host PC running ActiveSync.
2. 
Install the software using the host PC.
3. 
Insert the SDIO Wireless LAN card.
4. 
Start the program on the Pocket PC or PDA.
5.

Wireless Workgroup Bridges
A wireless workgroup or client bridge is a wireless device acting as a client device that will 
allow potentially several Ethernet devices on an Ethernet segment (devices connected to a 
common physical layer boundary) to connect to an infrastructure through a wireless access 
point. This is accomplished without the need to upgrade each wired device on the Ethernet 
segment to wireless. Figure 4.11 illustrates an application of a wireless workgroup bridge.
Features of Workgroup/Client Bridges
The wireless workgroup bridge (WWB), also known as a wireless client bridge, can be used 
in a variety of business or SOHO applications, including enterprise, medical, retail, educa-
tion, and warehouse. Supported devices include computers, printers, scales, medical equip-
ment, barcode readers, and point-of-sale machines such as cash registers. Although the 
workgroup/client bridge may have the appearance and features of an infrastructure device 
such as a wireless access point, it is considered a client device. A workgroup bridge will 
allow for a limited number of wired client devices to connect to and use network resources. 
A wireless access point sees a wireless workgroup bridge as a single station even if several 
wired stations are connected, because the wireless workgroup bridge multiplexes the signal 
to a single wireless connection. In other words, it is basically a multiplex device.

Chapter 4  Wireless LAN Client Devices
3. 
Using a web browser, connect to the assigned IP address. In some cases it may be nec-
essary to assign an IP address to the workgroup or client bridge from a CLI prior to 
configuring the bridge.
4. 
From the web management interface, assign the correct service set identifier (SSID) and 
RF channel in order to associate to the correct access point.
5. 
Configure the correct security settings, either WPA or WPA2 and Personal or 
Enterprise mode.
6. 
Verify association of the workgroup/client bridge to the desired access point.
Always read the manufacturer’s manual regarding installation and 
safety before attempting installation.
Another form of wireless client bridge is one that is designed to allow a variety of single 
Ethernet devices, not just computers, to connect to and use wireless networks. These 
devices will have an Ethernet port but are not wireless-capable. This type of client bridge 
also has characteristics similar to some infrastructure devices, such as wireless access 
points. One beneﬁ t is that in most cases no software is required; that is, you will not 
have to install device driver or client utility software on the client Ethernet device. These 
devices are seen by the access point as a single wireless client. Devices that can beneﬁ t 
from this type of client bridge are printers, DVD/media players, and game consoles. Figure 
4.12 shows a wireless client bridge.

Client Device Drivers
All devices connected to a computer require a device driver. Components requiring drivers 
include keyboards, mice, video cards, USB ports, printers, wired network interface cards, 
IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN cards, and many others. The device driver is software that 
allows the installed device to communicate with or take instructions from the computer 
operating system in order to provide correct functionality.
It is important to verify the latest revision of the device driver from the client device 
manufacturer. Having the latest revision installed will ensure correct operation and 
sometimes add additional features. Figure 4.13 shows a device listing in the Windows 7 
Professional operating system.

Client Utility Software
All IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN cards require conﬁ guration in order to connect to a wire-
less network. The conﬁ guration capabilities of device drivers are usually very limited. 
Therefore, a user needs additional conﬁ guration software. The user can choose from either

Chapter 4  Wireless LAN Client Devices
manufacturer-speciﬁ c utilities or third-party client utilities built into some operating sys-
tems. When IEEE 802.1X port-based authentication is used, the client device is known as 
the supplicant. The supplicant will provide authentication credentials to the authenticator, 
which in wireless networking is the access point. 802.1X authentication will be discussed 
in more detail in Chapter 9, “Wireless LAN Security Basics.” Regardless of the client utility 
installed, a user has the capability to create a proﬁ le that will retain the connection/session 
parameters. A proﬁ le will contain information regarding a speciﬁ c connection, including 
network name or SSID and security settings.
Manufacturer-Specific Client Utilities
Most manufacturers of wireless LAN adapters provide a software client utility for the 
wireless adapter. The features of the utility depend on whether the client is SOHO grade 
or enterprise grade. SOHO grade client utilities have basic connection and security param-
eters. The client software installation usually is part of the adapter install process and is 
typically performed through a setup wizard. Figure 4.14 shows a screenshot from a SOHO 
client utility.

127
Enterprise-grade client utilities may have a more advanced feature set, including con-
nection statistics and site survey. Typically, a user can install the device driver and client 
utility simultaneously or will be able to choose separate installation procedures. In most 
enterprise-grade client utilities, proﬁ le setup is a manual process requiring a user to have 
a basic understanding of the adapter’s capabilities as well as the network conﬁ guration. 
Figure 4.15 shows an enterprise-grade client utility.

Third-Party Client Utilities
Another option for a wireless LAN adapter client utility is a third-party utility built into 
a computer operating system. Recent versions of the Microsoft Windows operating sys-
tem—Windows XP Vista and Windows 7, for example—have a client utility built in and 
running as a service. In Windows XP this client utility is available from the Wireless Zero 
Conﬁ guration (WZC) service. Figure 4.16 shows the Windows XP WZC client utility.
In later versions such as Windows 7, the service is now called the WLAN AutoConﬁ g. 
After the wireless adapter is installed, a user may select a wireless network to connect to 
and supply security parameters if required. Figure 4.17 shows the Windows 7 Professional 
client utility using the Microsoft AutoConﬁ g service.

Summary

Summary
There are many types of wireless LAN client devices used in various applications. These 
device types include desktop and notebook computers, printers, and barcode scanners, to 
name a few. A wireless client adapter uses radio hardware or chipset to send the digital data 
(all the ones and zeros) across the air using radio frequency. This chapter looked at some 
of the various IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN adapter types, explaining the features, common 
hardware, software, and conﬁ guration procedures. External adapters with wireless LAN 
functionality include:


PCMCIA


ExpressCard


USB 2.0


CompactFlash (CF)
PCMCIA adapters, although still available for purchase and used in many installa-
tions, are becoming less popular. Finding a newer notebook computer that has an interface 
to support a PCMCIA adapter is not as common. The PCMCIA Association has been 
dissolved and the San Jose ofﬁ ce closed. This speciﬁ cation is now handled by the USB 
Implementers Forum. 
Wireless LAN adapters are also available as internal adapters. These adapters may 
require some disassembly or removal of a panel for installation. Internal adapter types 
include these:


PCI


Mini-PCI


Full Mini-PCIe 


Half Mini-PCIe
Wireless LAN adapters require a device driver in order to communicate with the operat-
ing system, and in most cases software utilities may be installed and/or conﬁ gured in order 
to connect the wireless network. This chapter described several installation scenarios for 
various types of wireless LAN adapters, including PCMCIA, USB, and PCI. We also looked 
at how a wireless workgroup bridge can be used to connect computers and other devices on 
an Ethernet segment to a network by connecting to an access point.
Finally, this chapter showed how wireless LAN client utilities simplify the process of 
connecting to a wireless network. Client utilities are sometimes supplied by the manu-
facturer of the adapter or may part of the operating system. Windows Wireless Zero 
Conﬁ guration (WZC) or WLAN AutoConﬁ g (Windows 7) is a commonly used operating 
system client utility.

It is important to understand how digital data is sent from one 
device to another. Whether on a wired network or a wireless 
network, an access method is used to transfer this type of elec-
tronic information. Two common access methods are CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA. The type 
of medium in use—wired or wireless—will determine which of these two access methods is 
best suited for the application. You saw in previous chapters that wireless LANs use radio 
frequencies with air as the communication medium. This chapter will discuss the various 
techniques and methods used to get digital computer data from one device to another using 
spread-spectrum and other physical layer modulation technologies.
It is important to understand that different spread-spectrum technologies such as FHSS, 
DSSS, and HR/DSSS will allow for various data rates. The spread-spectrum or other physi-
cal layer technology used will determine the maximum amount of data transfer as well as 
the resilience to noise and other interfering sources. We will look at the 802.11 channels, 
the number of channels available, channel spacing, and the frequencies of the unlicensed 
radio frequency bands used with wireless networking. We will also discuss the implications 
of overlapping channels and interference. Finally, this chapter will discuss co-location of 
different technologies used in various amendments to the standard as well as interference 
from wireless LANs and other sources, including WPANs.
The IEEE 802.11-2012 standard has been officially released. This stan-
dard includes all communication amendments that were outstanding 
or part of the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard, including IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n. 
Even though these amendments are now incorporated into the new-
est version of the standard, we will discuss the technology using the 
original amendment names, 802.11b, 802.11a, and so on, because these 
names are still commonly used in the industry.
Network Access Methods
Network access methods allow devices connected to a common infrastructure to communi-
cate and transmit data across a network medium from one device to another. Several differ-
ent types of network access methods are used in computer networks. The two types we will 
discuss in this chapter are:

Network Access Methods
137


Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)


Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
Because Ethernet networks have the capability to detect collisions, 802.3 Ethernet net-
works use CSMA/CD as the access method. Devices on a wireless LAN do not have the 
capability to detect collisions; therefore 802.11 wireless LANs use CSMA/CA for the access 
method. Since multiple wireless devices can use an access point at the same time, wireless 
devices that connect to an access point are competing to share the medium; therefore, it is 
important to control the medium in order to minimize collisions. The CSMA/CA process 
provides this control. 
Detecting Network Traffic Collisions with CSMA/CD
802.3 Ethernet networks use CSMA/CD to share the medium. The name of this access 
method describes how it functions.
The abbreviation CSMA/CD is broken down as follows:


Carrier Sense—Devices sense the medium (in this case, Ethernet cable) to see if it is 
clear (no data being transmitted).


Multiple Access—Many devices accessing the medium at the same time.


Collision Detection—Detecting collisions that occur on the medium during the trans-
mission of data.
CSMA/CD is a contention-based media access control method that Ethernet devices use 
to share the medium. This method allows only one device to transmit at any one time.
In computing terminology, contention is deﬁ ned as multiple devices competing for a 
chance to send data on the network. CSMA/CD functions like this:
1. 
A device with data to transmit checks whether any data is being transmitted on the 
Ethernet cable (sensing).
2. 
If the device senses that the medium is clear and no data is being transmitted, it trans-
mits its own data.
3. 
If more than one device transmits simultaneously, a collision occurs and the data is 
lost. The devices detect the collision and each will back off for a random amount of 
time.
4. 
After the random amount of time expires, the device checks the cable and attempts to 
send the data again.
This contention of the Ethernet segment is one reason for decreased data throughput of 
the transmitting devices. Figure 5.1 demonstrates CSMA/CD with desktop computers con-
nected to an Ethernet segment.

Conversation as a Form of CSMA/CD
An analogy for CSMA/CD is conversation among a group of people in which all the individ-
uals in the group would like a chance to speak. Everyone is listening to each other (sensing 
the medium). Only one person at a time gets a chance to say something. This is an exam-
ple of a multiple access shared medium (MA). If there is a pause in the conversation, two 
or more people listening may notice the opportunity and may say something at the exact 
same time, in which case neither may be heard by the rest of the group. This is an example 
of a collision. At this point, the collision is detected (CD) and those involved in the failed 
communication wait a few seconds and attempt to speak again later—hence, CSMA/CD.
Avoiding Network Traffic Collisions with CSMA/CA
Wireless LANs use CSMA/CA to share the medium. The main difference from CSMA/CD 
is the CA—collision avoidance. Just as in CSMA/CD, the abbreviation CSMA/CA gives an 
idea of how it functions:


Carrier Sense—Sensing the medium, in this case the air


Multiple Access—Many devices accessing the medium at the same time


Collision Avoidance—Avoiding collisions that may occur on the medium during 
 transmission
Because wireless LAN devices have no way to detect collisions, the CSMA/CD access 
method is not an adequate solution for wireless LAN communications. If wireless LANs 
were to use CSMA/CD, collisions would occur at the wireless access point and all data 
would be lost. At this point, a transmitting device would not know that it should 
retransmit the information, because the receiving device would be unaware that a collision 
occurred; the result would be very poor performance.

Network Access Methods
139
Instead of detecting transmission collisions, CSMA/CA uses mechanisms that attempt 
to avoid collisions. Although these mechanisms impose some overhead, the overall beneﬁ t 
is better data throughput because data collisions are minimized. This overhead occurs 
because devices use “countdown timers” that require them to wait for periods of time 
before they are able to transmit again. This helps to avoid data collisions.
Lecture Q&A as a Form of CSMA/CA
An analogy for CSMA/CA is the question-and-answer period following a lecture. The 
lecture hall is ﬁ lled with many people (multiple access). A presenter has ﬁ nished giving a 
speech and it is now question-and-answer time. The presenter shouts out, “Does anyone 
have a question?” An attendee by the name of Marvin listens (sensing the carrier). He 
does not hear anyone speaking, so he yells out a question. Although many people are in 
the room (again, multiple access), they can hear that Marvin has the ﬂ oor and this time is 
dedicated to him. So they defer and do not ask their question until Marvin’s question has 
been answered by the speaker (collision avoidance); hence, CSMA/CA.
Reserving Time for Data Transmission Using Distributed 
Coordination Function
One of the access methods wireless LAN devices use to communicate is known as distrib-
uted coordinated function (DCF). This method of access employs a contention period for 
devices competing to send data on the network. This collision avoidance mechanism is part 
of a detailed process requiring certain criteria to be met in order for a frame (a Layer 2 
digital transmission unit) to be transmitted across the medium. In the case of wireless LAN 
technology, this medium is the air, using radio frequencies (RF).
To avoid collisions, the devices are required to:


Detect the RF energy of other devices transmitting, a technique known as Clear Chan-
nel Assessment (CCA).


Announce how much time is required for the frame exchange to occur allowing other 
stations read the duration field and set their Network Allocation Vector (NAV).


Wait for a predetermined period of time between frames, a technique known as inter-
frame spacing.


Back off and retry if the medium is busy, a technique known as the random backoff 
timer via the contention window.
In short, these devices are reserving the medium so that transmissions can take place 
and avoid collisions. Figure 5.2 illustrates wireless LAN devices using CSMA/CA for an 
access method.

The 802.11 standard also specifies two other access methods used 
with wireless networking. Point Coordination Function (PCF) mode is a 
 contention-free mode that works by polling stations and giving them an 
opportunity to send information without contending with other devices. 
PCF mode was optional and never implemented by any manufacturers. 
Another access method, Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) mode, was 
introduced with 802.11e for quality of service (QoS) technology.
Effects of Half Duplex on Wireless Throughput
As discussed in Chapter 3, “Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices,” wireless LANs use 
half duplex communication. To review, half duplex in computer terminology is deﬁ ned as 
 two-way communication that occurs in only one direction at a time. Communication only 
one way at a time means less data throughput for the connected device(s). Half-duplex 
communication is part of the reason why in wireless LANs the amount of data being 
transferred is sometimes less than half of the advertised data rate; collisions and additional 
overhead are other factors to consider. An 802.11b device may only get 5.5 Mbps or less 
data transfer even though this technology is rated at 11 Mbps. On a good day, 802.11a 
or 802.11g devices will also average less than half of the advertised data rates. Figure 5.3 
shows the half-duplex communication method and some of the effect it has on through-
put. The data rate in this example is 54 Mbps, but the throughput is less than half of that, 
about 22 Mbps. The newest IEEE amendment, 802.11n, uses MIMO technology and has 

Network Access Methods

a potential maximum data rate of up to 600 Mbps. However, many of the client devices 
available today have a maximum of about 300–450 Mbps. The actual throughput can be 
as low as 30 Mbps.

Narrowband vs. Spread-Spectrum Communication
Narrowband and spread-spectrum are two examples of how devices can communicate 
using radio frequency.
One example of narrowband communication is an FM radio station. FM radio stations 
use licensed frequency ranges that are tuned to a speciﬁ c radio frequency in the FM band. 
A radio station can transmit a signal at a high power of tens of thousands of watts in a very 
narrow frequency. Depending on the conditions, a receiver can hear the station for tens or 
even possibly hundreds of miles.
Figure 5.4 shows the high amount of output power over a narrowband frequency of a 
potential FM radio station.
In contrast, spread-spectrum technology uses low power over a wider range of fre-
quency. Figure 5.5 illustrates how a spread spectrum–capable access point uses low power 
over a wide frequency range.

Lecturer vs. Breakout Discussions
Narrowband communication is similar to a lecture presented in a large room ﬁ lled with 
several hundred attendees. The presenter may have a microphone connected to an 
ampliﬁ er or PA system to address the large audience. All attendees at this event will pay 
attention to the presenter, who will get the message across to the entire audience in this 
very large venue.
Spread-spectrum communication is similar to what happens when the same audience 
breaks out into small groups in which each member is communicating only with other 
members of that group. These groups of individuals will be speaking at a much lower vol-
ume without the help of a high-power microphone, and the conversation volume will not 
exceed the area in which this group is contained.
Spread-Spectrum Technology
Two types of spread-spectrum technology were speciﬁ ed in the original IEEE 802.11 wire-
less LAN standard ratiﬁ ed in 1997:


Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)


Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
These spread-spectrum technologies communicate in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency range. 
There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these spread-spectrum types.
Spread-spectrum technologies take the digital information generated by a computer 
(ones and zeros) and, through the use of modulation technologies, send it across the air 
between devices using radio frequency (RF).
In order for devices to communicate effectively and understand one another, they must 
be using the same spread-spectrum and modulation technology. This would be analogous to 
two people trying to talk with each other. If the two people don’t know the same language, 
they will not be able to understand each other and a conversation could not take place.
Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum
Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is used in a variety of devices in computer 
technology and communications. FHSS was used by many early adopters of wireless net-
working, including computers, barcode scanners, and other handheld or portable devices. 
Although deﬁ ned in the original IEEE 802.11 standard, this technology is considered 
“legacy” (out of date) in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. However, FHSS is still common 
today in many devices such as cordless telephones and IEEE 802.15 wireless personal area 

144
Chapter 5  Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread-Spectrum Technology
networks (WPANs), including Bluetooth mice, cameras, phones, wireless headsets, and 
some older wireless LAN technology devices. Bluetooth technology using FHSS is compara-
tively slower than newer IEEE 802.11 wireless communications.
FHSS operates by sending small amounts of information such as digital data across the 
entire 2.4 GHz ISM band. As the name implies, this technology changes the frequency 
(“hops”) constantly in a speciﬁ c sequence or hopping pattern and remains on a frequency 
for a speciﬁ ed amount of time known as the dwell time. The dwell time value will depend 
on the local regulatory domain where the device is used. In the United States, for example, 
the Federal Communications Commission allows a maximum dwell time of 400 millisec-
onds. A transmitter and receiver will be synchronized with the same hopping sequence, 
therefore allowing the devices to communicate.
The data rate for IEEE 802.11 FHSS is only 1 and 2 Mbps, which is considered slow 
by modern computer applications. However, the data rate is more than adequate for some 
applications. For example, various wireless devices in retail and manufacturing used FHSS 
in handheld scanners and other portable technology for many years. The cost of upgrading 
these devices to support higher data rates was prohibitive and unnecessary in many cases, 
and so until recently they were still used in such environments. Figure 5.6 illustrates what 
FHSS would look like if you could see the RF hopping through the band.

For Sales Personnel
FHSS use in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking is considered legacy and is rarely if at all 
supported. Therefore, if a customer wishes to purchase any FHSS wireless LAN equip-
ment, they should be directed to the proper upgrade path for a more current and sup-
ported solution.

For Technical Support Personnel
There may be some legacy IEEE 802.11 wireless networking FHSS devices in operation 
in various industries today. For whatever reason these are still in use, it is important to 
understand that replacement devices will be very difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd, if they can be found at 
all. It is best to consider the appropriate upgrade path for a more current and supported

Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) is a spread-spectrum technology used with 
wireless LANs and deﬁ ned by the original IEEE 802.11 standard. Like FHSS, DSSS sup-
ports data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps and is considered slow by today’s computer networking 
requirements.
DSSS uses special techniques to transmit digital data (ones and zeros) across the air 
using radio frequency (RF). This is accomplished by modulating or modifying the radio 
frequency characteristics such as phase, amplitude, and frequency (see Chapter 6, “Radio 
Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology”).
In addition to modulation, DSSS uses technology known as a spreading code to provide 
redundancy of the digital data as it traverses through the air. The spreading code transmits 
information on multiple subcarriers, and the redundancy helps the receiver detect trans-
mission errors due to interference. Subcarriers are smaller segments of the radio frequency 
channel that is in use. This spreading of information across the 22 MHz–wide channel is 
what helps makes DSSS resilient to interference. This spreading code technology allows the 
receiver to determine if a single bit of digital data (symbol) received is a binary 0 or binary 
1. Depending on the data rate, the transmitter and receiver understand the spreading code 
in use and therefore are able to communicate.
An example of a coding technique is Barker code. Barker code is used as the spread-
ing code for DSSS at the data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps. IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs can use 
this 11 “chip” spreading code for communications. Each digital data bit (binary 1 or 0) is 
combined with the set Barker code through what is called an exclusive OR (XOR) process. 
XOR is a way of combining binary data bits in digital electronics. The result then spreads 
the binary 0 or 1 over a 22 MHz wide channel, helping to make it resilient to radio fre-
quency interference. Since both the transmitter and receiver understand the same code, they 
would be able to determine the information that was sent across the air.
DSSS operates within a range of RF frequency also known as a channel. The channel 
is deﬁ ned by its center frequency; that is, Channel 1 is 2.412 GHz on center, Channel 2 is 
2.417 GHz on center, and so on. Each channel in the 2.4 GHz ISM band is separated by 
5 MHz on center. Unlike narrowband communication, which operates on a single narrow 
frequency, a DSSS channel is 22 MHz wide and is one of 14 channels in the 2.4 GHz to 
2.5 GHz ISM band. The country and location of the device will determine which of the 14 
channels are available for use in that speciﬁ c area.

FHSS and DSSS both operate in the same frequency range. If devices that 
use both technologies are occupying the same physical area, the devices 
may encounter some interference. Therefore, RF interference may occur 
from either IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN devices using the same channel or 
non-IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN devices that are using the same RF channel. 
This includes anything wireless that does not use IEEE 802.11 technology 
but is operating in the same frequency range, such as 2.4 GHz wireless 
cameras, 2-way radios or radio monitors, and even microwave ovens.
802.11b High Rate/Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum
High rate/direct-sequence spread spectrum (HR/DSSS) is deﬁ ned in the IEEE 802.11b 
amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard. HR/DSSS (802.11b) introduced higher data rates 
of 5.5 and 11 Mbps. At the time this amendment was released, because of the higher data 
rates this technology helped fuel the acceleration of IEEE standards based on wireless LAN 
technology. The desire for 802.11 technology grew as the availability became greater and 
the cost decreased.

Spread-Spectrum Technology
147
Like DSSS, HR/DSSS uses one of fourteen 22 MHz wide channels to transmit and 
receive digital computer data. The main difference between these two technologies is that 
HR/DSSS supports higher data rates of 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps.
HR/DSSS (802.11b) also uses a different spreading code or an encoding technique than 
DSSS. HR/DSSS uses complementary code keying (CCK) for transmitting data at 5.5 and 
11 Mbps. The detailed operation of CCK is beyond the scope of this book.
IEEE 802.11 DSSS and HR/DSSS Channels
DSSS and HR/DSSS operate in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientiﬁ c, and medical (ISM) license 
free band. This band has 14 available channels. Depending on the country and location, all 
14 channels may not be available. Table 5.1 shows the 14 available channels in the 2.4 GHz 
ISM band for a few different countries.

Of these 14 channels, mathematically there are only 3 adjacent nonoverlapping channels, 
with the exception of channel 14. According to the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard, “Channel 
14 shall be designated speciﬁ cally for operation in Japan.” Channel 14 is separated by 12 
MHz on center from Channel 13, whereas Channels 1–13 are separated by 5 MHz on 
center of each channel. There are 3 MHz of separation where the radio frequency of one 
channel ends and the next adjacent nonoverlapping channel begins. For example, Channel 
1 and Channel 6 are adjacent nonoverlapping channels. Channel 1 ends at 2.423 GHz and 
Channel 6 begins at 2.426 GHz. Mathematically this is a separation of 3 MHz. This means 
that three access points can be co-located in the same physical space without overlapping 
channel interference. However, there is still theoretically a small amount of overlapping RF 
or harmonics between these two channels. This small level of overlap is not large enough to 
cause any real interference issues. Figure 5.9 illustrates 3 of the ﬁ rst 14 channels that do not 
overlap in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.
Each DSSS channel is 22 MHz wide. Using spread-spectrum technology, a 22 MHz–
wide channel helps add resiliency to interference for data transmissions and gives the 
capability to move large amounts of data with a small amount of power. Some early IEEE 
802.11 devices included barcode scanners, and they worked with limited battery life. Using 
a spreading technology instead of narrowband technology helped to conserve battery life 
and increased the use of IEEE 802.11 devices as a whole.

IEEE 802.11g Extended Rate Physical
The IEEE 802.11g amendment was released in 2003 and introduced technology that allowed 
for higher data rates for devices and operation in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The objective of 
this amendment was to allow for these higher data rates (up to 54 Mbps) using orthogonal 
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and still maintain backward compatibility with 
existing 802.11b technology and devices. This technology, known as Extended Rate Physical 
(ERP), builds on the data rates of 1, 2 Mbps DSSS (802.11) and 5.5, 11 Mbps HR/DSSS 
(802.11b). The 802.11g amendment addresses several compatibility operation modes:


ERP-DSSS/CCK


ERP-OFDM


ERP-PBCC (Optional)


DSSS-OFDM (Optional)
The 802.11g amendment required support for ERP-DSSS/CCK and ERP-OFDM. This 
allowed for both the 802.11b data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps and the new OFDM data 
rates of 6, 9 ,12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. Manufacturers of wireless LAN equipment 
implement this in various ways. In a graphical user interface, there may be a drop-down 
menu that allows a user to select a speciﬁ c operation mode such as mixed mode, b/g mode, 
b-only mode, and so on. Another possibility is to select the individual data rates using radio 
buttons. For manufacturers that provide a command-line interface (CLI) option, the appro-
priate commands would need to be executed in order to enable or disable the desired data

IEEE 802.11n High Throughput
The IEEE 802.11n amendment was ratiﬁ ed in September 2009. This new high throughput 
(HT) physical layer (PHY) technology is based on the OFDM (PHY) in Clause 17 (802.11a) 
PHY. 802.11n HT allows extensibility of up to four spatial streams, using a channel width 
of 20 MHz. Also, transmission using one to four spatial streams is deﬁ ned for operation 
in 20/40 MHz channel width mode. This technology is capable of supporting data rates 
up to 600 Mbps using four spatial streams with a 20/40 MHz channel. IEEE 802.11n HT 
provides features that can support a throughput of 100 Mbps and greater. Other optional 
features on both the transmit and receive sides include:

The 802.11n amendment allows for operation in both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz 
UNII bands with either 20 MHz or 40 MHz wide channels. Although 40 MHz wide chan-
nels are allowed in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, best practices recommend against it. Using a 
40 MHz channel in this band would only equate to a single channel without any channel 
overlap.
It is important to understand the difference between data rate and 
throughput. Data rates are what a station is capable of exchanging infor-
mation, whereas throughput is the rate at which the information is actually 
moving. Data rate and throughput are compared in more detail in Chapter 
8, “WLAN Terminology and Technology.”

Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing
OFDM is used by the IEEE 802.11a (OFDM), IEEE 802.11g Extended Rate Physical 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (ERP-OFDM), and IEEE 802.11n High 
Throughput (HT-OFDM) amendments to the IEEE 802.11 standard. OFDM allows for 
much higher data rate transfers than DSSS and HR/DSSS, up to 54 Mbps for 802.11a and 
802.11g and potentially up to 600 Mbps for 802.11n.
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a technology designed to trans-
mit many signals simultaneously over one transmission path in a shared medium and is 
used in wireless and other transmission systems. Every signal travels within its own unique 
frequency subcarrier (a separate signal carried on a main RF transmission). 802.11a and 
802.11g OFDM distributes computer data over 52 subcarriers equally spaced apart, and 
4 of the 52 subcarriers do not carry data and are used as pilot channels. 802.11n allows 
for 56 subcarriers of which 52 are usable for data with a 20 MHz wide channel and 114 
subcarriers, of which 108 are usable for data with a 40 MHz wide channel. Having many 
subcarriers allows for high data rates in wireless LAN IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11g 
devices. 802.11n devices (HT-OFDM) may use a MIMO technology known as spatial 
multiplexing (SM), which uses several radio chains to transmit different pieces of the same 
information simultaneously, greatly increasing throughput. In addition to high data rates, 
OFDM helps provide resiliency to interference from other wireless devices.

OFDM functions in either the 2.4 GHz ISM or the 5 GHz UNII bands. The channel width 
is smaller than DSSS or HR/DSSS. The width of an OFDM channel is only 20 MHz com-
pared to 22 MHz for DSSS. Figure 5.11 shows a representation of a 20 MHz–wide OFDM

Like DSSS, when OFDM is used in the 2.4 GHz ISM band there are only three non-
overlapping adjacent channels for use. This will limit the use of bonded channels (20/40 
MHz wide channels) in IEEE 802.11n (HT-OFDM) deployments that are located in 
the same radio frequency physical area. In the 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information 
Infrastructure (UNII) bands, the channel spacing is such that there is no overlap. The fre-
quency range used will determine how many nonoverlapping channels are available for use. 
In the lower and upper UNII bands, 4 non-overlapping channels are available. The middle 
UNII band has 15 nonoverlapping channels available. All UNII band channels are 20 
MHz wide and separated by 20 MHz from the center frequencies of each channel. Certain 
regulatory domains, including the United States Federal Communication Commission 
(FCC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), require the use 
of dynamic frequency selection (DFS) support for wireless devices such as access points 
that operate in the middle 5 GHz (5.250 GHz–5.725 GHz) UNII band. DFS will allow an 
access point to change the radio frequency channel it is operating on in order to avoid inter-
fering with certain type of radar systems. Table 5.2 shows the 23 available channels, center 
frequency, and channel number in the 5 GHz UNII band. Also displayed is a single 5 GHz 
ISM channel that is available by some regulatory agencies for use with wireless networking.

arately with some similarities to the 2.4 GHz ISM band and allows for the

IEEE 802.11n Multiple Input/Multiple Output Technology
Multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) is a technology used by IEEE 802.11n 
devices. MIMO technology potentially has data rates up to 600 Mbps. Currently, devices 
using MIMO technology are capable of data rates of up to 300–450 Mbps. MIMO 
provides users with a better overall experience for data, voice, and video communications 
with throughput up to ﬁ ve times more than current 802.11 a/g, single input/single output 
(SISO) networks.
SISO is the most basic wireless antenna technology used in a wireless LAN system. One 
antenna is used at the transmitter to transmit data, and one antenna is used at the receiver 
to receive the data. Some SISO systems support a technology known as diversity, which uses 
two antennas with a single radio. Diversity technology will help to lessen the effects of mul-
tipath, which is caused by reﬂ ections. Diversity and multipath are discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 7, “WLAN Antennas and Accessories.” Coverage is more predictable and consistent 
with MIMO networks because devices using this technology are able to utilize reﬂ ected sig-
nals, which are a problem for wireless networks using other WLAN technologies.
MIMO also allows 802.11n networks better throughput than DSSS or OFDM-based 
networks at the same distance. IEEE 802.11n MIMO-based networks offer backward com-
patibility with 802.11a/b/g networks and devices in both the 2.4 GHz ISM and the 5 GHz 
UNII bands, allowing for deployments to continue using their existing hardware.
Some of the beneﬁ ts of 802.11n MIMO networks include throughput, reliability, and 
predictability:


Five times more throughput
Enhanced ﬁ le transfer and download speeds for large ﬁ les


Twice as reliable
Lower latency for mobile communications





More consistent coverage and throughput for mobile applications
Unlike IEEE 802.11b (HR/DSSS) and IEEE 802.11a/g (OFDM) access points, MIMO 
access points use multiple radios with multiple antennas. The multiple radio chains and 
some additional intelligence are what give 802.11n MIMO access points the capability to 
process reﬂ ected signals. Since MIMO works with both the 2.4 GHz ISM and the 5 GHZ 
UNII bands, a dual-band IEEE 802.11n MIMO access point will have up to six radio 
chains—three for 2.4 GHz and three for 5 GHz—and six antennas (one for each radio) for 
data rates of up to 450 Mbps. Figure 5.12 shows that MIMO uses multiple radio chains 
and multiple antennas to transmit and receive data.
802.11n systems use MIMO technology; they have more receivers and are much more 
sensitive than the average 802.11a or 802.11g radio. The following techniques are what 
allow for better performance and much higher data rates (currently up to 450 Mbps with 3 
¥ 3 ¥ 3 MIMO and eventually up to 600 Mbps with 4 ¥ 4 ¥ 4 MIMO):

802.11a/b/g networks are known as single input/single output (SISO) systems, which 
means that performance can degrade as a result of multipath, poor reception because of 
obstacles, and RF interference sources. 802.11n MIMO networks can take advantage of 
multipath to help increase throughput at a given range, providing much higher throughput 
at the same range. 

156 
Chapter 5  Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread-Spectrum Technology
MIMO Channels
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, IEEE 802.11n MIMO networks can operate in both 
the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII bands and are capable of either 20 or 20/40 MHz–wide 
channels. Even while operating in 20/40 MHz channel width mode, many frames are still 
transmitted with a 20 MHz channel width. The 20 and 20/40 MHz channel widths are 
deﬁ ned by the IEEE for transmission of OFDM modulated data. As you would expect, 
wider channels mean more data can be transmitted over the RF medium simultaneously. 
Therefore, wider channels allow higher data throughput. Think of this like cars traveling 
on a two-lane or a four-lane highway. A 20 MHz–wide channel can be looked at as the 
two-lane highway and a 40 MHz wide channel the four-lane highway. More cars can pass 
through four lanes in the same amount of time than can pass through two lanes. Figure 
5.13 illustrates this point. 
F I G U R E  5 .13   More lanes, more cars—wider channels, more data
A 40 MHz wide channel is like moving from 2 to 4 lanes.
The 20 MHz or 20/40 MHz channels can be used in either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz 
frequency ranges. Because of the limited amount of frequency space in the 2.4 GHz 
ISM band, there is only one 20/40 MHz–wide channel without any adjacent- channel 
overlap. Figure 5.14 shows a 40 MHz wide channel as speciﬁ ed in the 802.11n 
amendment.
Although most enterprise-grade access points support bonded (20/40 MHz 
wide) channels, there are still some wireless client devices, both new and 
legacy, that do not support this technology. To achieve the higher data 
rates that IEEE 802.11n offers, the client and the access point must both 
support the newer technologies. If the wireless client device does not sup-
port the bonded channels, the access point will be able to adapt, allowing 
for coexistence.

Co-location of IEEE 802.11b HR/DSSS and IEEE 
802.11a/g/n OFDM Systems
Now we will look at the co-location of different 802.11a/b/g/n devices. One thing to under-
stand is that some consider 802.11b systems to be legacy devices that are on the verge of 
becoming obsolete. However, this may not be the case in all installations. Mostly because 
of legacy hardware and depending on the type of WLAN installation (typically public guest 
networks and the retail environment), support for 802.11b networks may still be required. 
Additionally, the latest revision of the 802.11 standard (IEEE 802.11-2012) still addresses 
this technology, and therefore it is important to understand the implications of co-location 
of 802.11b devices.
All IEEE-based wireless LANs can be co-located—that is, they can function in the 
same RF space. The technologies that the devices use determine how well they work 
together. Both HR/DSSS (802.11b) and ERP-OFDM (802.11g/n) networks operate in the 
2.4 GHz frequency range ISM band. 802.11g-compliant devices are backward-compatible 
with 802.11b-compliant devices. However, this backward compatibility comes at a price: 
reduced data throughput. Because of protection mechanisms, ERP-OFDM devices used in 
802.11g will suffer in performance when an HR/DSSS device is in the same radio or hear-
ing range of the ERP-OFDM device. 

158
Chapter 5  Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread-Spectrum Technology
HR/DSSS and ERP-OFDM systems have many common features:


Both operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.


Both have three nonoverlapping channels.


Both are subject to interference from other devices operating in the same frequency range.
HR/DSSS and ERP-OFDM (802.11b-compliant and 802.11g-compliant) devices are 
backward-compatible. ERP-OFDM is rated at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. 
Actual throughput in an environment relatively free of interference will be about 15 to 20 
Mbps. If a DSSS or HR/DSSS device is introduced in the radio range of the ERP-OFDM 
device, the throughput will decrease signiﬁ cantly because of protection mechanisms. How 
much of an impact this makes depends on many factors in the environment. Typically, the 
decrease in throughput is about 25 percent to 30 percent. It is important to understand 
that this is not just limited to a single wireless access point or the basic service area. If an 
802.11g access point can “hear” another 802.11g access point on the same radio frequency 
channel that is in ERP protection mode, that access point will also enter a protection mode 
state. This is known as what some call the “ripple effect.”
Just as co-location of 802.11b/g/n EPR-OFDM systems needs to be taken into consid-
eration, the same holds true with 802.11a/n OFDM systems. The real difference is the 
frequency band that 802.11a/n systems operate in. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, 
802.11 devices operate in the 5 GHz UNII band. The IEEE 802.11n High Throughput 
(HT) amendment to the standard addresses different protection mechanisms. This is 
because 802.11n devices can operate in both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHZ UNII bands. 
Therefore, an 802.11n access point will need to allow 802.11a devices to utilize the net-
work along with 802.11n devices, both types in the 5 GHz UNII band.
802.11a OFDM and 802.11n HT-OFDM systems have several common features:


Both operate in the 5 GHz UNII band.


Both have up to 23 nonoverlapping channels (depending on the regulatory agency).


Both are subject to interference from other devices operating in the same frequency 
range.
802.11n HT networks offer various protection mechanisms to ensure interoperability 
and co-location. 
OFDM and HT-OFDM (802.11n-compliant and 802.11a-compliant) devices are 
backward-compatible. OFDM is rated at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. Actual 
throughput in an environment relatively free of interference may be a little higher than an 
802.11g environment, about 18 to 22 Mbps. Networks that operate in the 5 GHz UNII 
band are not subject to co-location issues with DSSS or HR/DSSS, because they operate 
in different frequency ranges. The 802.11n amendment introduced a new concept called 
the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). This is a different way to represent the data 
rates that are available with 802.11n technology. Previously, the IEEE 802.11 standard and 
amendments speciﬁ ed data rates as individual values—1 Mbps, 2 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps, and 
11 Mbps in IEEE 802.11b technology, for example. The IEEE 802.11n amendment to the 
standard now refers to this as the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). This is because 
depending on the technology enabled or used, a single MCS may support multiple data 

IEEE 802.11a, 802.11g and 802.11n Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
159
rates. For example an MCS Index 7 will support either 65.0 Mbps or 72.2 Mbps, depend-
ing on whether short guard interval is enabled. 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, 802.11n devices have a maximum data rate or MCS 
of up to 600 Mbps. However, most technologies available at the time of this writing offer 
maximum data rates of 300–450 Mbps. Just as devices that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM 
band must be able to coexist, devices that operate in the 5 GHz band must be able to coex-
ist as well. Co-location of 802.11a/n devices is possible through the use of additional pro-
tection mechanisms. ERP and HT protection mechanisms will be discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 8. Figure 5.15 illustrates co-location of various 802.11 technologies.

Adjacent-Channel and Co-channel Interference
Adjacent-channel and co-channel interference (two or more RF signals interacting with each 
other and causing a degradation of performance) is a concern in the design, development, 
and deployment of IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks. Another term used for this type of 
interference is “co-channel cooperation.” This is because the wireless devices are contending 
to use the medium rather than just being seen as radio frequency noise to each other. This 
type of interference will have an impact on the amount of actual throughput between devices 
over a wireless network. As mentioned earlier, the 2.4 GHz ISM band has only three non-
overlapping channels. Careful channel planning is required when designing or implementing 
a wireless network. This type of planning will minimize issues such as poor throughput as a 
result of adjacent and co-channel interference. Channel planning involves designing wireless 
networks so that overlapping RF cells are on different (nonoverlapping) channels—for exam-
ple, channels 1, 6, and 11 in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. This will help optimize performance and 
minimize degradation of throughput because of adjacent and co-channel interference.

160
Chapter 5  Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread-Spectrum Technology
With the advancements in 802.11 technologies, channel planning is more “automated” 
by the use of spectrum management technology and the IEEE 802.11 standard. However, 
it is still important to understand the concept of channel planning. RF energy propagates in 
several directions simultaneously. A well-designed wireless network will account for a three-
dimensional propagation. In other words, in a three-story building, the RF from an access 
point on the second ﬂ oor building may pass through to the ﬁ rst and third ﬂ oors; therefore, 
interference could be an issue if the network is not planned properly. Figure 5.16 illustrates 
overlapping channel interference with two access points in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.

channel 8 in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.
WLAN/WPAN Coexistence
Wireless personal networks (WPANs) typically consist of portable devices such as personal 
digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, headsets, computer keyboards, mice, and now tablet 
devices. In Chapter 6, we will discuss how the performance of IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs 
can be affected when co-located with WPAN devices. The IEEE 802.15 standard addresses 
WPANs and includes Bluetooth and Zigbee networks. Bluetooth is one of the most popular 

IEEE 802.11a, 802.11g and 802.11n Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
161
WPAN network technologies and operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band using frequency hop-
ping spread spectrum (FHSS) technology.
Early Bluetooth devices can cause signiﬁ cant interference while operating in close prox-
imity to IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. Bluetooth was designed to hop at a rate of 1,600 
times per second across the entire 2.4 GHz band, potentially causing signiﬁ cant interfer-
ence with 802.11 wireless networks. Newer versions of Bluetooth use adaptive frequency 
hopping (AFH) and thus are less likely to interfere with IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, 
even though they still operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Devices that use adaptive fre-
quency hopping will try to avoid using the same frequencies, decreasing the chance of 
interference. Since these devices operate at low power, most WPANs communicate in small, 
close-range, peer-to-peer networks.
Taking Adjacent-Channel and Co-channel Interference into Consideration 
When Planning a New Wireless Network
As a wireless network engineer, you are tasked with deploying a new wireless net-
work in a multi-tenant building. The area to be covered is approximately 50,000 
square feet.
Your ﬁ rst task, prior to the procurement and deployment of the wireless network, should 
be to perform a spectrum analysis and site survey. This will help determine the best fre-
quency and channels to be used in the new deployment.
A survey reveals that tenants on the ﬂ oors above and below where the new deployment 
is to be installed are also using IEEE 802.11b/g/n networks, with many access points 
on channels across the entire 2.4 GHz ISM band. A situation such as this may make the 
deployment difﬁ cult. There is an increased possibility of adjacent-channel and 
co-channel interference.
Upon further evaluation, it is determined that the lower band of the 5 GHz UNII band 
is not being utilized to any large extent. Since this is a new deployment, you have the 
opportunity to purchase equipment that will utilize the 5 GHz UNII band as well as the 2.4 
GHz ISM band. Some of the questions that need to be evaluated include:


Are any devices limited to 802.11b/g/n capability only?


Does the network require backward compatibility to 802.11b/g/n?


Does the network need to support guest access?


What impact would a network using only 5 GHz 802.11a/n have on the business?


Is it possible to utilize both frequency bands in this deployment to maximize through-
put while limiting interference?
These are just some questions that need to be considered prior to making any ﬁ nal 
decisions on the network to be installed and the equipment to be purchased.

Chapter 5  Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread-Spectrum Technology
Summary
In this chapter, we looked at access methods used to get data from one device to another 
when multiple users share the medium. These access methods consist of collision avoidance 
and collision detection:


CSMA/CD—Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection


CSMA/CA—Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance
WLANs have no way of detecting collisions; therefore they must use collision avoidance 
or CSMA/CA. Wireless LANs use half-duplex communication, which decreases the perfor-
mance of the communication data transfer.
This chapter also looked at the spread-spectrum and physical layer (PHY) technolo-
gies used with WLANs and the differences among them. The IEEE standard and various 
amendments use different spread-spectrum and PHY technologies and unlicensed radio 
spectrum allowing for data rates up to 450 Mbps. These physical layer (PHY) technologies 
include:


FHSS—For data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps


DSSS—For data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps


HR/DSSS—For data rates of 5.5 and 11 Mbps


OFDM—For data rates up to 54 Mbps


HT-OFDM—Currently for data rates of up to 450 Mbps, eventually may be up to 600 
Mbps
Even though FHSS is considered legacy technology for WLANs, it is still important to 
understand some of the basics of this technology since it is still in use today in many indus-
tries in various types of wireless technologies, including IEEE 802.15 personal area net-
working (PAN), Bluetooth, and cordless telephones.
We looked at the different channel sets used with 802.11 wireless networks and some of 
the co-location considerations.
Some of the physical layer technologies discussed in this chapter are more susceptible to 
interference than others. This can make installations in some industries challenging. We 
also looked at co-location of HR/DSSS and ERP-OFDM systems and some of the chal-
lenges it can pose. Finally, this chapter discussed the coexistence of WPANs and WLANs 
and the various devices and technology that can cause interference when working in the 
same RF space.

Radio frequency (RF) plays an essential role in wireless LAN 
technology. Radio waves are passed through the air (which is 
the medium) and are used to get information from one wire-
less device to another. Technically speaking, with respect to wireless LANs, RF consists of 
high-frequency alternating current (AC) signals passing over a copper cable connected to an 
antenna. The antenna then transforms the signal into radio waves that propagate through 
the air from a transmitter to a receiver.
Unlike wired devices, which use physical cable to communicate, wireless LANs use the 
radio waves and the air to communicate. This chapter will discuss the characteristics of RF 
and explain how far a radio signal will travel depending on various factors, the area cov-
ered by the radio frequency propagation, and some of the factors determining how many 
clients or devices can use the RF signals for data communications. This chapter will also 
explain the range and speed of RF transmissions. Range (how far radio waves will travel) 
and speed can be affected by several environmental conditions or behaviors, such as reﬂ ec-
tion and refraction. Additionally, this chapter will examine some of the conditions that 
affect the transmission of information across the air, including interference.
Understanding RF units of measure such as watts (W), milliwatts (mW), and decibels 
(dB) is important to RF work, just as understanding denominations of money such as 
U.S. dollars and British pounds is an important part of daily life. We will discuss RF sig-
nal measurements, including received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR).
Understanding Radio Frequency 
Radio frequency (RF) waves are used in a wide range of communications, including radio, 
television, cordless phones, wireless LANs, and satellite communications. RF is around 
everyone and everything, and comes in many forms. RF energy is emitted from the numer-
ous devices that use it for various types of communications. For the most part, it is invisible 
to humans. There is so much of it around, that if you could actually see RF, it would prob-
ably scare you. Don’t let it scare you, however, because the amount of regulated RF power 
transmitted from the devices used in daily lives is harmless. Figure 6.1 shows some of the 
many ways RF is used. Studies have shown that the amount of power emitted from many of 
these devices, such as cordless telephones or wireless network adapters, will not cause any 
physical harm if the devices are manufactured not to exceed the maximum regulated power 
allowed for the device.

Remember, RF consists of high-frequency alternating current (AC) signals passing over a 
copper cable connected to an antenna. This antenna will then transform the received signal 
into radio waves that propagate through the air. The most basic AC signal is a sine wave. 
This wave is the result of an electrical current varying uniformly in voltage over a period 
of time. This sine wave cycle will repeat a speciﬁ c number of times (cycles) over a period of 
one second. The number of cycles per second will result in different frequencies. Frequency 
is discussed later in this section. Figure 6.2 shows a basic sine wave.
Successful radio transmissions consist of a minimum of two components, a transmitter
and receiver (see Figure 6.3). With IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, a wireless station can 
transmit and receive and is known as a transceiver. These two components work together: 
For every radio transmitter there must be one or more radio receivers. It is important to 
understand the basic characteristics of radio frequency transmissions. These characteristics 
work together to form alternating current signals and include the wavelength, frequency, 
amplitude, and phase. The antenna will transform these signals into radio waves that travel 
through the air carrying information from the transmitter to the receiver. This is accom-
plished in different ways depending on the wireless technology in use. This theory will be 
discussed more in Chapter 7, “WLAN Antennas and Accessories.”

Wavelength in Wireless LANs
The wavelength is the distance of one complete cycle or one oscillation of an AC signal. 
Wavelength is typically identiﬁ ed by the Greek symbol lambda (l), which is used in formu-
las for calculations. This distance is usually measured in centimeters or inches. Figure 6.4 
shows an example of a wavelength.
IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs use both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz unlicensed frequency 
ranges for transmission. The IEEE 802.11-2012 Standard also speciﬁ es some additional 
frequency ranges in which wireless LANs can operate. Although these do not fall under the 
“unlicensed” category, 4.9 GHz public safety and 3.650 GHz (IEEE 802.11y amendment)

Frequency is deﬁ ned as the number of complete cycles in one second. Low frequencies cor-
respond to long waves and high frequencies to short waves, so the higher the frequency, the

case letter f.

How Far Can a Signal Travel?
A few years back, 900 MHz cordless telephones were very popular. Cordless tele-
phones were introduced in the 1970s, and in 1990 the FCC opened the 900 MHz 
range for these telephones. With a 900 MHz phone you could hypothetically go up 
to 500 feet away from the cordless phone’s base station before losing the signal 
and no longer being able to make a phone call. In the past few years, higher-
frequency phones have increased in popularity. After upgrading to a 2.4 GHz phone, 
you may have noticed you can only get about 250 feet away (half the distance 
compared to a 900 MHz phone) in the same environment before losing the signal. 
This is because the 2.4 GHz wavelength is about half the distance of a 900 MHz 
wavelength, assuming both phones are operating at the same output power. With 
5.8 GHz cordless telephones now becoming available, the range will be still less, 
assuming the same amount of transmit power.
IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs work in several unlicensed frequency ranges. The unli-
censed ranges used for WLANs are 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz and 5.15 GHz to 5.875 GHz. 
There are some areas in the 5.15 GHz to 5.875 GHz range that are not used for standards-
based wireless networking.
Amplitude in Wireless LANs
From a wireless LAN perspective, the amplitude is the strength or the amount of power 
of an RF signal. This is calculated from the height (in a two-dimensional view), on the Y 
axis of the sine wave, representing the voltage. As mentioned earlier, a basic sine wave is a 
change in voltage over a period of time. Using a formula, the voltage at the peak of the sig-
nal can be used to calculate the amount of RF power. So an increase in amplitude is equal 
to an increase in RF power. An increase in power is also known as gain. Conversely, any 
decrease in amplitude will be a decrease in power. A decrease in power is also known as 
loss. If a transmitter outputs a certain amount of RF power—for example, 100 mW—it has 

Understanding Radio Frequency 
175
a speciﬁ c amplitude of some value. As this signal travels through an RF cable, it will have a 
speciﬁ c level of loss based on the cable in use, resulting in attenuation. Therefore the result 
will be less amplitude at the end of the cable due to the loss value of the cable.
Figure 6.6 shows two signals operating at the same frequency with different amplitudes. 
The signal with the higher amplitude (Signal A) is more powerful than the signal with the 
lower amplitude (Signal B).

Phase in Wireless LANs
Phase is the difference in degrees at a particular point in the time of a cycle, measured from 
some arbitrary zero and expressed as an angle. For example, if a second sine wave starts a 
quarter of a wavelength after the ﬁ rst sine wave, it is considered to be 90° out of phase with 
the ﬁ rst sine wave. Figure 6.7 shows an example of the phase relationship between two 
AC signals. Two radio waves that have the same frequency but start at different times are 
known to have a phase difference and are considered out of phase with one another. The 
amount of the phase difference is typically measured in degrees ranging from 0° to 360°.
Waves that arrive at a receiver out of phase will experience some level of distortion, 
which will cause corruption. This is known as multipath. The difference in time of arrival 
of the main signal and a reﬂ ected signal that causes the multipath problem is called the 
delay spread. If two waves arrive at a receiver 180° out of phase, this will usually result in 
a cancellation effect or nullify the two signals. Conversely, two waves that arrive in phase 
are additive, and this will result in an increase in signal strength known as upfade. Keep in 
mind, however, that the amplitude of the waves that experience the upfade effect will never 
be higher than the wave transmitted.
Radio Frequency Used in  Wireless LANs
As discussed in Chapter 2, “Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking,” RF spec-
trum is governed by local regulatory agencies. The country where the RF is used determines 
the regulations, such as frequency use and maximum power. Table 6.2 illustrates examples 
of local RF regulations.

OFDM PHY shall not operate in frequency bands not allocated by a 
regulatory body in its operational region. Regulatory requirements for 
a given frequency band are set by the regulatory authority responsible 
for spectrum management in a given geographic region or domain.” 
The FCC in the United States allows this frequency for IEEE 802.11

utilizing four frequency ranges: UNII-1, the lower band; UNII-2 and UNII-2e, the middle

Radio Frequency Channels
As you have seen, radio frequency is divided into bands. These bands can be further sepa-
rated into channels. A channel is a smaller allocation of the radio frequency band. One 
familiar application in which this is accomplished is television. Until over-the-air televi-
sion became available in digital format, television was allocated certain frequency ranges. 
Common television channels operated in the very high frequency (VHF) band—for exam-
ple, channels 2 through 13 operated from 54 through 216 MHz. This frequency range was 
divided into 12 channels, allowing optimal use of the frequency range for the application, 
in this case television signals.
A viewer can change channels on a television to watch different programs running 
simultaneously. However, only one program can be viewed at any one time depending 
on which channel is currently selected. (Picture-in-picture televisions can show two or 
more channels at once on the screen, but each picture is still being received on a different 
channel.) 
Wireless LANs use channels in the same way. Certain unlicensed frequency ranges are 
allocated for wireless networking, and those frequency ranges are subdivided into channels. 
In order for a transmitter and receiver to communicate with one another, they must be on 
the same channel. The 2.4 GHz ISM band has a total of 14 channels available for wireless 
networking. The locale where they are used will determine which of the 14 channels can be 
legally used for wireless networking. In the United States, IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless net-
works use 11 of the 14 channels available in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Each of these 11 chan-
nels for DSSS or HR/DSSS is 22 MHz wide, and for OFDM it is 20 MHz wide. Understand 
that these channels are further deﬁ ned by their center frequency; for example, Channel 1 in 
the 2.4 GHz ISM band has the center frequency at 2.412 GHz. Simple mathematics show 
there will be overlap in order to accommodate all of the 20 MHz or 22 MHz wide channels 
in this frequency range. Table 6.4 shows the 14 available channels in the 2.4 GHz range.

The 5 GHz UNII band is also divided into channels. This band consists of four bands—
lower, lower middle, upper middle, and upper. These four bands consist of four different 
frequency ranges. Since there are fewer channels in the same amount of space, channels in 
the UNII band do not overlap. In the 5 GHz UNII band, channels are 20 MHz wide. Table

Chapter 6  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology
Radio Frequency Range
Range for wireless LANs is based on the wavelength or distance of a single cycle. The 
higher the frequency, the shorter the range of the signal and the lower the frequency, the 
longer the range of the signal. At the same output power level, a 2.4 GHz signal will travel 
almost twice as far as a 5 GHz signal. If a network design is planning to use dual-band 
access points, range will need to be considered to ensure proper coverage for both the 2.4 
GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII bands. A wireless site survey will help determine the usable 
range an access point will produce. A survey can involve physically walking around the 
proposed space and/or predictive modeling using one of many software programs. This 
process is discussed further in Chapter 11, “Performing an RF Wireless LAN Site Survey.”
Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity
Coverage and capacity are two key factors to take into consideration when designing and 
implementing an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN. During the design phase of an IEEE 802.3 
wired network, the design engineer will take capacity into account, verifying and validating 
that there are enough capacity switches, ports, and so on for the user base of the network. 
The same is true for a wireless network. The number of devices/users connected to an 
access point is something that needs to be carefully considered. The fact that wireless net-
works use a shared medium is an issue because the more devices that are connected to an 
access point, the lower the performance may be, depending on what the devices are doing. 
This capacity consideration will ensure satisﬁ ed end users and excellent network perfor-
mance—proof of a successful wireless network design and deployment.
In wireless networks, coverage also needs to be considered. Coverage is determined by 
the RF cell size. In IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, a cell is the area of RF coverage of the 
transmitter, in most cases an access point. Depending on implementation, wide coverage or 
large cell size may not be the best solution. A large space covered by a single access point 
could result in less than adequate network performance based on factors such as the users’ 
distance from the access point. The farther away from an access point, the less throughput 
a device or user will experience. If users will be scattered throughout a large space, it may 
be best to have several access points covering the space to allow for optimal performance.
The term cell has several different meanings depending on the context. 
In the world of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, a cell is the radio cover-
age area for a transmitter such as an access point or a client device.
Wireless LAN Coverage
The term coverage has different meanings depending on the context in which it used. For 
example, if you buy a gallon of paint, the label will specify the approximate coverage area 

Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity
181
in square feet. If one gallon of paint covers 300 sq ft and the room you wish to paint is 900 
sq ft, simple math shows at least three gallons of paint would be needed to effectively cover 
the room.
The concept is similar in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. However, unlike with paint, 
there is no simple rule that determines how much space an access point will cover with the RF 
energy it is transmitting. This coverage will depend on many factors, some of which include:


Physical size of the area


Bandwidth-intensive software applications in use or hardware applications may 
negatively impact the performance therefore requiring smaller RF coverage cells


Obstacles, including building materials and propagation (the way radio waves spread 
through an area)


Radio frequency range


WLAN hardware in use (this affects coverage because higher frequencies, such as 5 
GHz, do not travel as far as lower frequencies, such as 2.4 GHz)


Transmitter output power
You might initially assume that you want the RF signal to propagate over the largest 
area possible. But this may not be the best solution. A very large cell may allow too many 
devices to connect to a single access point, causing a decrease in overall performance. For 
those client devices connected at a greater distance, the performance will be lower than for 
stations closer to the access point. Figure 6.8 shows a large coverage area, approximately 
11,250 sq ft (1,046 sq m) covered with a single access point. This is an example of too large 
an area for a single access point.

Chapter 6  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology
Physical Size of the Area
Rarely, if at all, will a manufacturer of enterprise-grade IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN 
hardware commit to the amount of area an access point will cover. There are too many 
variables to take into consideration, which makes it difﬁ cult to specify an exact number. 
However, some manufacturers may estimate the effective range of the device or access 
point. A site survey of the area will help determine the coverage area of an access point. A 
manual survey will allow for testing to verify the distance a signal will travel. A predictive 
site survey will model the environment and determine the signal propagation. This concept 
will be discussed further in Chapter 11.
Applications in Use
The application types in use—either software or hardware—can affect the bandwidth of an 
access point. If the devices connected to an access point use bandwidth-intensive applica-
tions such as a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) appli-
cation, it could result in poor throughput for all devices or users connected to that access 
point. This is another example where more access points, with each covering a smaller 
area, could be a better solution than a single access point covering a large area. Multiple 
access points could allow the high-bandwidth users to be separated from other parts of the 
network, increasing overall performance of the network.
Obstacles, Building Materials, Propagation, and RF Range
Obstacles in an area, including building materials such as walls, doors, windows, and 
furnishings, as well as the physical properties of these obstacles—thickness of the walls 
and doors, density of the windows, and type of furnishings—can also affect coverage. The 
radio frequency used—either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz—will determine how well a signal will 
propagate and handle an obstacle. 
For example, a wall made from sheetrock or drywall materials may have an attenuation 
value of about 3 dB to 4 dB, whereas a wall made of concrete may have an attenuation value of 
about 12 dB. Therefore the sheetrock wall would have less impact on the RF propagation than 
the concrete wall. Partitions, walls, and other obstacles will also determine the coverage pat-
tern of an access point because of the way RF behaves as it travels through the air. Behaviors 
of RF will be discussed later in this chapter in the section “Environment: RF Behavior.”
WLAN Hardware and Output Power
The wireless LAN hardware in use can also have an impact on the coverage area. Examples 
include the antenna type, antenna orientation, and gain of the antenna. The higher the gain 
of an antenna, the greater the coverage area; conversely, the lower the gain of an antenna, 
the smaller the coverage area. The polarization of an antenna (horizontal vs. vertical) will 
also have an effect on the coverage area because of the different shapes of the radiation pat-
terns. The output power of the transmitter or access point will also have an effect on cov-
erage. The higher the output power, the greater distance a signal will propagate. A higher 
power signal will provide more coverage. Most enterprise-grade access points provide the 
capability to control or adjust the output power.

Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity
183
Wireless LAN Capacity
One deﬁ nition of capacity is the maximum amount that can be received or contained. 
An example of this would be an elevator in a building. Typically an elevator will have a 
maximum number of people or amount of weight it can hold; this is usually stated on a 
panel within the elevator. To ensure safety, the elevator may have a safety mechanism to 
prevent overloading. Likewise, a restaurant has a certain number of chairs to hold custom-
ers; therefore, they would have a maximum capacity of customers who can be served at any 
one time. Does this mean that when a restaurant ﬁ lls its seats to capacity, the doors close 
and no other customers can enter the building? Not necessarily. In some cases, a restaurant 
could have customers standing and waiting to be seated.
Just as an elevator or a restaurant has a limited number of people they can accommodate 
comfortably, wireless access points also have a limited number of devices they can handle, 
known as capacity. The capacity of an access point is how many devices or users the AP 
can service effectively, offering the best performance. This capacity depends on several 
factors, including:


Software and hardware applications in use


Desired throughput or performance


Number of devices/users
The following sections discuss how these factors affect the capacity of an access point.
What Happens When an Access Point Is Overloaded?
If the capacity of a single access point has exceeded the maximum number of users or 
devices based on the performance metrics, access points may need to be added. If a 
wireless network is installed correctly, an access point will not be overloaded with an 
excessive number of users. An overloaded access point will result in poor performance 
and therefore unhappy users.
To understand why, look back at the restaurant example. If a restaurant seats 20 custom-
ers and all 20 seats are taken, the restaurant has reached its capacity. Let’s say the restau-
rant is short-staffed because two servers did not show up for work. The servers who did 
show up will have to work extra hard to handle the customers. This may cause delays in 
service because the servers need to handle more than their normal number of tables. The 
delays may result in unhappy customers.
The same is true for wireless access points. If a wireless access point has reached its 
capacity, it could get overloaded. This would result in its taking longer to handle any indi-
vidual request for access. The delays may result in unhappy users. Therefore this situation 
could justify adding another access point in the area to handle the additional users. Just as 
a restaurant will not close its doors when all seats are taken, an access point will continue 
to accept users to connect unless restrictions such as load balancing are implemented. 

184
Chapter 6  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology
Software and Hardware Applications in Use
The software and hardware applications in use may affect the capacity of an access point. 
Some applications are more bandwidth-intensive than others. For example, word process-
ing applications may not require much bandwidth whereas database or CAD/CAM appli-
cations may require much more bandwidth than other applications. If high-bandwidth 
applications are in use, the contention among the connected users will increase because 
they are using a shared medium (air and RF). Therefore performance will potentially be 
reduced for all users connected to the access point. The access point is providing the same 
amount of bandwidth, but the overall performance has been decreased for the connected 
users because the software applications are all using a lot of bandwidth. 
The use of Voice over Wireless LAN (VoWLAN) technology is also increasing steadily 
in many wireless network deployments. This is an example of a hardware application. 
Voice technology on wireless networks is subject to latency. Therefore, depending on the 
number of voice client devices connecting to an access point, the network must be carefully 
planned. Capacity planning and quality of service (QoS) features are important when it 
comes to deploying voice technology on wireless networks.
Desired Throughput or Performance
The desired throughput or performance can also affect capacity. A large number of users 
connected to an access point using a bandwidth-intensive application will cause poor per-
formance. Therefore, it may be necessary to limit the capacity to a certain number of users 
to give the connected users the best performance possible. Any software application that is 
bandwidth-intensive, such as CAD/CAM, streaming video, or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) 
downloads, can have an effect on overall performance. One way to help resolve this would 
be to use load balancing to limit the number of users that can connect to an access point. 
Another way would be to create RF cells with smaller coverage and add more access points.
Number of Devices/Users
The number of devices or users in an area will also affect the access point capacity. A single 
access point covering a large area will potentially allow for a large number of devices con-
necting to the access point. For example, an ofﬁ ce of 8,000 sq ft may consist of 100 people, 
each with their own wireless device. This is an example of wide coverage and large capacity. 
The software applications in use on the wireless network will have an impact on the overall 
performance. If all 100 devices connected are using a CAD/CAM application, which is a 
bandwidth-intensive application, the overall performance will be poor because this type of 
application requires a lot of resources. Therefore more access points, each covering less space 
and less capacity, would parlay into better overall performance for all of the users.
Wide coverage in a densely populated area may allow too many devices to connect to a 
single access point, resulting in poor performance overall. As you learned earlier, wireless 
LANs use what is known as a shared medium. In other words, all devices users connected 
to an access point will share the available bandwidth. Too many devices using powerful 
applications will overload the access point, adding to the poor performance issues. This 

Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity 
185
scenario is considered a capacity issue. In this situation more access points with each AP 
covering a smaller area and a lower number of devices or less capacity would be a better 
solution. As you learned in Chapter 4, “Wireless LAN Client Devices,” many organizations 
now have to deal with the “Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)” issue.
In addition to potential problems with technical support and security, wireless LAN 
capacity is also a major concern. The BYOD expansion of Wi-Fi capable devices is causing 
a wireless client device density issue within the enterprise market. If a company’s corporate 
policy allows employees to bring their own wireless capable devices, then wireless LAN 
capacity needs to be carefully evaluated to address this potential issue.
Radio Frequency Channel Reuse and Device Co-location
Earlier in this chapter, it was noted that the 2.4 GHz ISM band has a total of three non-
overlapping channels. In the U.S. FCC implementation of this band, the three nonoverlap-
ping channels are 1, 6, and 11. This means there must be a separation of ﬁ ve channels in 
order for them to be considered nonoverlapping. In the 2.4 GHz ISM band, channels are 
separated by 5 MHz on center. Taking this into consideration, channels must be separated 
by 25 MHz or greater in order to be considered nonoverlapping (IEEE 802.11-2012, Clause 
18). This is calculated from ﬁ ve channels of separation multiplied by 5 MHz on center 
(5 ¥ 5 = 25). With deployments larger than a few access points, a channel plan may be nec-
essary. A channel plan will minimize the chance of interference caused by two transmitters 
(access points) set to the same or adjacent overlapping channels.
The IEEE 802.11-2012 Clause 16 (formerly Clause 15 in the IEEE 
802.11-1007 Standard) specifies 30 MHz or greater of separation to 
be considered nonoverlapping: “Adjacent channel rejection is defined 
between any two channels with ≥ 30 MHz separation in each chan-
nel group defined in 16.4.6.3.” Keep in mind that this specification is 
for 802.11 DSSS. For HR/DSSS (IEEE 802.11-2012, Clause 18), channels 
must be separated by 25 MHz or greater in order to be considered 
nonoverlapping.
Figure 6.9 illustrates a 2.4 GHz deployment with no channel planning. Users in the 
areas where the circles overlap will experience interference. This interference will result in 
lower overall throughput for the connected users because of the Physical layer (PHY) tech-
nologies that wireless LANs use. This interference basically has the same effect as collisions 
in an Ethernet network, resulting in retransmissions of data. 
A correct channel plan will implement channel reuse and ensure that overlapping cells 
will not use overlapping channels. Channel reuse is using non-overlapping channels—for 
example 1, 6, and 11 in the 2.4 GHz range—in such a way that the overlapping cells are 
on different RF channels. Figure 6.10 shows a 2.4 GHz deployment utilizing proper chan-
nel reuse. Channel reuse may be accomplished by mapping out the access points on a ﬂ oor 
plan and minimizing the chances that the RF cells propagated by the access points do not 

186

overlap on the same RF channels. This type of channel plan can de done manually or with 
site survey software applications. Site survey applications will be discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 11.

Radio Frequency Range and Speed
How far and fast a radio frequency signal can travel depends on a variety of factors, includ-
ing line of sight, interference, and the types of materials in the environment. This section 
discusses these factors.

Radio Frequency Range and Speed
187
Line of Sight in Wireless Networking
Radio frequency communication between devices in 802.11 wireless networking uses dif-
ferent types of line of sight. There are two types of line of sight to take into account when 
planning, designing, and installing wireless networks:


Visual line of sight


Direct link radio frequency (RF) line of sight
Visual line of sight is when a transmitter and receiver can “see” each other. In order 
for wireless networking direct link communication to be successful in an outdoor wireless 
link, there should be a clear, unobstructed view between the transmitter and receiver. An 
unobstructed line of sight means few or no obstacles blocking the RF signal between these 
devices.
In an outdoor wireless LAN installation, direct RF line of sight is an unobstructed line 
between a radio transmitter and receiver. This line will be surrounded by an area of radio 
frequency transmissions known as the Fresnel zone. The Fresnel zone consists of a number 
of concentric ellipsoidal volumes that surround the direct RF line of sight between two 
points, such as an RF transmitter and receiver or two wireless bridges.
In outdoor wireless LAN installations, the RF line of sight, and therefore the radio 
transmissions between a transmitter and receiver, could be affected if the total area 
of the Fresnel zone is blocked by more than 40 percent. This blockage can come from 
a variety of sources, such as trees, buildings, terrain, or other obstacles, including the 
curvature of the earth over a distance of 7 miles or greater. Figure 6.11 illustrates a 
Fresnel zone.
F I G U R E  6 .11   The oval area represents the Fresnel zone RF coverage area between 
a transmitter and receiver, two wireless bridges.
One way to think about line of sight is by the analogy of two people looking at each 
other. If two people about the same height standing some distance apart are making direct 
eye contact, they have a good visual line of sight. In addition to being able to see directly in 
front of them, people have peripheral vision. This peripheral vision gives people the ability 
to see movement and objects outside of their direct line of sight or direct eye contact. This 
peripheral vision or side vision is analogous to the Fresnel zone theory.

188 
Chapter 6  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology
E X E R C I S E  6 .1
Demonstrating Fresnel Zone and Blockage
Here is one way to demonstrate the Fresnel zone. Focus your eyes at a location on 
a wall. Make sure there are obstacles or movement off to both left and right sides 
of your view. Hold your hands down to your sides. Continue to focus your eyes 
for a minute or so, and then take your right, left, or both hands and slowly raise 
them from your sides toward the side of your head while blocking your peripheral 
vision. You’ll notice as your hands get closer to the side of your head the view of 
the objects or movement to the sides will be blocked by your hands. This is an 
example of a blocked Fresnel zone. 
Sixty percent of the total area of the Fresnel zone must be clear of 
obstacles in order to have RF line of sight.
Because of the low transmit and receive power and the short distance, a visual line of sight 
is not required for an indoor wireless LAN deployment. An indoor access point may cover 
areas that are divided by walls and other obstacles. With this short range and if the radio fre-
quency is able to penetrate the obstacles, wireless communication between a transmitter and 
a receiver will be successful even when the devices do not have a visual line of sight.
Wi-Fi and Non-Wi-Fi Interference
Interference from a radio frequency point of view occurs when a receiver hears two dif-
ferent signals on the same or close frequency. Interference causes received radio frequency 
signals to be distorted. In wireless LANs, this interference can have a severe impact on 
the quality of signal received by a wireless device. This distorted or corrupted signal will 
decrease the amount of data a device can effectively receive, thereby causing less data 
throughput. 
A wireless LAN receiver has similar characteristics to the human ear. Both can hear a 
range of frequencies. If one person is speaking and a number of people are listening to this 
speaker, that is analogous to a single transmitter and multiple receivers. If a second person 
started to speak at the same time, people listening might not be able to understand either 
speaker. In a sense, they are experiencing interference.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, an IEEE 802.11 wireless network may use the unli-
censed 2.4 GHz industrial, scientiﬁ c, and medical (ISM) band. This band is also used for 
many other devices, including:

Other IEEE 802.11 wireless networks
Because these devices also use radio frequency to operate, and the frequency is in the 
same unlicensed band as IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, they have the potential to interfere 
with one another. Although they may coexist in the same RF space, the interference factor 
needs to be taken into consideration. This can be done as part of the site survey process.
Co-channel and Adjacent Channel Interference
Co-channel or adjacent channel interference occurs when two devices in the same physi-
cal area are tuned to close radio frequency channels or the same channel. For example, an 
access point on channel 1 and another access point on channel 2 in close or hearing range of 
each other will experience adjacent channel interference. Some of the symptoms of this type 
of interference are reduced throughput and the equivalent of collisions causing data retrans-
missions. A new term being used for co-channel interference is “co-channel cooperation,” 
since it is not really interference but rather an increase in the size of the contention domain. 
Co-channel interference is defined as two different radio transmitters 
using the same frequency. The IEEE 802.11-2012 standard, however, 
defines interference between channels 1 and 2 as co-channel inter-
ference caused by overlapping channels. According to the standard, 
adjacent channel interference for HR/DSSS and ERP in the 2.4 GHz 
ISM band is caused by frequencies of greater than or equal to 25 
MHz separation, such as channels 1 and 6. The terms co-channel and 
adjacent are used loosely in the wireless LAN industry. Please consult 
specific manufacturers’ documentation for their definition. The CWNP 
program complies with the IEEE standards definition.
Overlapping interference is deﬁ ned as two devices (such as access points) on the same 
frequency overlapping one another. For example, two access points in close proximity to 
each other, one on channel 1 and the other on channel 3, might interfere with each other.
Both adjacent channel interference and co-channel channel interference will cause poor 
throughput on a wireless network. In a wireless network, co-channel or adjacent channel 
interference can have the same impact. Figure 6.12 shows that 2.4 GHz ISM band channel 
4 and channel 6 overlap.
A properly designed wireless LAN will have overlapping RF cells. Overlapping cells 
provide continuous coverage for the entire area where the access points are placed. 
Overlapping cells allow devices to move from one access point to another and maintain a 
constant connection. A well-designed wireless LAN will also minimize or eliminate over-
lapping channel interference. This design includes assigning nonoverlapping RF channels 

190
Chapter 6  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology
to cells that do overlap with each other. In practice, an overlapping cell design will include 
a 20 to 30 percent overlap to encourage better roaming. Wireless repeaters require a 50 
percent overlap to be effective. The frequency in use is determined by how many nonover-
lapping channels are available in the band. For example, in the United States, the 2.4 GHz 
band used for 802.11b/g/n has three nonoverlapping channels—1, 6, and 11. Figure 6.13 
shows 2.4 GHz ISM band with three nonoverlapping channels, channels 1, 6, and 11.

WLAN/WPAN Interference
The performance of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks can be affected when they are co-
located with IEEE 802.15 wireless personal area networks (WPANs). Bluetooth is an 
example of a wireless personal area network. Like 802.11, Bluetooth devices operate in the 

Wi-Fi and Non-Wi-Fi Interference
191
2.4 GHz frequency range and use frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technology. 
This functionality in older Bluetooth devices could potentially interfere with IEEE 802.11 
wireless networks. Newer versions of Bluetooth that use adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) 
have less chance of interfering with other wireless networks, including 802.11 wireless 
networks. Adaptive frequency hopping allows devices such as Bluetooth to adapt to the RF 
environment by seeking areas of interference and not operating in those speciﬁ c frequency 
ranges. This will lessen the chances of 802.15 WPAN devices interfering with 802.11 
WLAN devices. This newer technology is proven such that WLAN 802.11 and WPAN 
802.15 Bluetooth devices may coexist in the same physical radio chipset. 
Environment: RF Behavior
In addition to various types of radio frequency interference, the interaction between RF 
and the surrounding environment can also affect the performance of IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networks. RF behavior is the result of environmental conditions, including:


Reflection


Refraction


Diffraction


Scattering


Absorption

Reflection
Reﬂ ection occurs when an RF signal bounces off a smooth, nonabsorptive surface such as 
a table top and changes direction. Reﬂ ections can affect indoor wireless LAN installations 
fairly signiﬁ cantly in certain cases. Depending on the interior of the building—such as the 
type of walls, ﬂ oors, or furnishings—there could be a large number of reﬂ ected signals. If 
not properly handled, reﬂ ections could cause a decrease in throughput and poor network 
performance. Figure 6.14 illustrates reﬂ ection.

Chapter 6  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology
Think of a ping-pong game when it comes to reflection. When a 
ping-pong ball is served or hit, it comes in contact with the table—a 
smooth, hard surface—and bounces off in a different direction. This is 
similar to how reflection works with radio frequency.
Refraction
When an RF signal passes between mediums of different densities, it may change speeds 
and also bend. This behavior of RF is called refraction. Glass is an example of material that 
may cause refraction. When an RF signal comes in contact with an obstacle such as glass, 
the signal is refracted (bent) as it passes through and some of the signal is lost. The amount 
of loss depends on the type of glass, its thickness, and other properties. Figure 6.15 shows 
refraction.

Diffraction
When an RF signal passes an obstacle, the wave changes direction by bending around the 
obstacle. This RF behavior is called diffraction. A building or other tall structure could 
cause diffraction, as could a column in a large open area or conference hall. Figure 6.16 
illustrates diffraction. When the signal bends around a column, building, or other obstacle, 
the signal weakens, resulting in some level of loss.

Demonstrating Diffraction: Rock in a Pond
You can demonstrate diffraction by using a pond of still water. Place a large object 
such as a two-by-four piece of lumber in a pond of still water. After the water 
settles, try to drop a pebble or small rock off to the side of the piece of lumber. 
Watch closely and you will see the ripple of the water bend around the lumber, 
resulting in a diffraction effect.
Scattering
When an RF signal strikes an uneven surface, wavefronts of the signal will reﬂ ect off the 
uneven surface in several directions. This is known as scattering. Scattering, illustrated in 
Figure 6.17, is another form of loss that may severely degrade the RF signal.

Absorption
When material absorbs an RF signal, no signal penetrates through the material. An example 
of absorption is the human body. The human body has a high water content and will absorb 
RF signals. This type of absorption can be a problem for wireless network deployments in cer-
tain environments. Densely populated areas such as airports and conference halls need to con-
sider absorption when designing a wireless LAN deployment. Figure 6.18 shows absorption.
F I G U R E  6 .18   Radio frequency absorption

Absorbing material
Diffusion
Diffusion occurs when the RF signal naturally widens as it leaves an antenna element. As a 
result of this widening effect, the transmitted radio frequency signal will decrease in ampli-
tude and be less powerful at any distance from the antenna. This is known as free space 
path loss (FSPL). FSPL is the greatest form of loss factor in a radio frequency link. FSPL is 
calculated using frequency and distance as variables and entered into a mathematical for-
mula. The receiving antenna is only able to receive a small amount of the transmitted signal 
because of this widening effect of the diffused signal as it propagates through the air. Any 
signal that is not received by the intended device is considered loss.
Basic Units of Radio Frequency 
Measurement
If a person were given a dollar bill, they would be one dollar richer. If this person were 
given 100 cents, they would still be one dollar richer. From this example, we see 1 dollar 
= 100 cents and 1 cent = 1/100th of a dollar. One dollar and 100 cents are the same net 
amount, but a cent and a dollar are different units of currency.
The same is true for radio frequency measures of power. The basic unit of measure for 
radio frequency is the watt. A wireless access point may be set to an output of 30 mW (mil-
liwatts) of power. A milliwatt is 1/1000 of a watt. Just as in currency cents and dollars are 
both denominations of money, watts and milliwatts are measurements of RF power. Other 
units of measurement for RF are dB, dBi, dBd, and dBm.

Basic Units of Radio Frequency Measurement 
195
Absolute Measurements of Radio Frequency Power
The amount of power leaving a wireless access point is one example of an absolute mea-
sure of power. This is an actual power measurement and not a ratio or a relative value. In 
other words, this is a measurable amount of power and can be determined with the proper 
instrument, such as a watt meter. A typical maximum amount of transmit output power 
from an access point is 100 mW.
The measure of AC power can be calculated using a basic formula. The formula is:
P = E ¥ I
Power (P) equals voltage (E) multiplied by current (I).
A simple example would be to calculate the power from 1 volt and 1 amp. Using the 
given variables, the formula is:
P = 1 volt ¥ 1 amp
The answer would be power = 1 watt.
The formula P = E ¥ I is shown here for reference only to demon-
strate the calculation of radio frequency power. You will not need to 
know this formula for the CWTS exam.
Watt (W)
The watt (W) is a basic unit of power measurement. It is an absolute value or measurable 
value. Most wireless networks function in the milliwatt range. Power level in watts is a 
common measurement in long distance point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections.
Milliwatt (mW)
One milliwatt (mW) is 1/1000 of a watt. This is a common value used in RF work and 
IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. The output power of an access point typically ranges from 1 
mW to 100 mW. Most enterprise-grade access points allow you to change the output power. 
Most SOHO-grade access points have a ﬁ xed output power, typically 30 mW. The milli-
watt is also an absolute unit of power measurement.
Decibel Relative to a Milliwatt (dBm)
dBm is the power level compared to 1 milliwatt. This is based on a logarithmic function. A 
good rule to remember is 0 dBm = 1 mW. This value is considered as absolute zero. Using 
a formula or basic RF calculation rules, you can easily convert any milliwatt value to deci-
bels: 100 mW = 20 dBm, for example. 
The dBm is also an absolute unit of power measurement. A dB is an example of a change 
in power or relative measurement of power where dBm is measured power referenced to 
1 milliwatt or an absolute measure of power. The next section discusses relative measure-
ments of power.

196 
Chapter 6  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology
Remember, absolute values are measurable values of power such as 
watt, milliwatt, and decibel milliwatt.
Relative Measurements of Radio Frequency Power
Changes in radio frequency power are known as relative. dB and dBi are relative measure-
ments of power. An example would be an RF ampliﬁ er. If the input power to an ampliﬁ er is 10 
mW and the output power is 100 mW, the gain of the ampliﬁ er is 10 dB—a change in power.
If the input power to an antenna is 100 mW and the output power is 200 mW, the gain 
of the antenna is 3 dBi—a change in power. Both of these are examples of changes in 
power and are known as relative expressions of RF power.
Decibel (dB)
The decibel (dB) is a ratio of two different power levels caused by a change in power. Figure 
6.19 shows how an ampliﬁ er will provide an increase or change in power.

Basic RF Math: The 3s and 10s Rule
This section is beyond the scope of the CWTS exam objectives and is for informa-
tional purposes only.
There is a simple way to perform any RF math calculation without having to use 
logarithms and mathematical formulas. This method is known as the 3s and 10s 
Rule (or sometimes referred to as the 10s and 3s Rule). If you remember ﬁ ve basic 
steps, you can perform any RF math calculation. The ﬁ ve basic steps are as follows:


0 dBm = 1 mW (starting point)


Increase by 3 dBm and power in mW doubles or ¥ 2


Decrease by 3 dBm and power in mW is cut in half or ÷ 2


Increase by 10 dBm and power in mW is multiplied by 10 or ¥ 10


Decrease by 10 dBm and power in mW is divided by 10 or ÷ 10

Decibel Isotropic (dBi)
Decibel isotropic (dBi) is the unit that represents the gain or increase in signal strength 
of an antenna. The term isotropic in the RF world means energy broadcast equally in all 
directions in a spherical fashion. An imaginary, perfect antenna is known as an isotropic 
radiator. This is a theoretical concept and is used as a reference and in calculations. dBi 
will be discussed and used in more detail in Chapter 7. Table 6.6 shows a summary of abso-
lute and relative power measurements.

Remember, relative values are changes in power from one value to 
another value. dB, dBi, and dBd measure relative power.
Decibel Dipole (dBd)
The gain of some antennas may be measured in decibel dipole (dBd). This unit of measure-
ment refers to the antenna gain with respect to a reference dipole antenna. The gain of 
most antennas used in wireless LANs is measured in decibel isotropic (dBi); however, some 
manufacturers may reference the gain of an antenna in dBd. The following simple formula 
derives the dBi value from the dBd value:
dBi = dBd + 2.14
This formula converts from dBi to dBd:
dBd = dBi – 2.14
dBd vs. dBi
You are a procurement agent working for a manufacturing company. An engineer 
orders some antennas to be used in a wireless LAN deployment. The part number 
you received from the engineer on the bill of materials is for antennas that are cur-
rently out of stock at your normal supplier. The order has to be placed as soon as 

198
Chapter 6  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology
possible, but technical support for the vendor is gone for the day and you are not able to 
get any assistance.
You found what appears to be a reasonable alternative for the requested antennas. 
However, the gain of the antennas does not exactly match what the engineer docu-
mented on the bill of materials. The engineer requested omnidirectional antennas 
with a gain of 6 dBi. You found what appears to be a comparable alternate with 
a gain of 6 dBd. It will be necessary for you to determine whether these antennas 
will work. Not quite understanding the difference, you do some research to deter-
mine the difference between dBd and dBi. After searching various websites, you 
ﬁ nd a formula to convert the two different units:
dBi = dBd + 2.14
Using your calculator, you enter the value from the speciﬁ cation sheet for the alternate 
antennas:
6 dBd + 2.14 = 8.14 dBi
Unfortunately, the antennas found will not be a good alternate in this example. 
Back to the drawing board!
Radio Frequency Signal Measurements
It is important to understand the various signal measurements of radio frequency used in 
wireless LAN technology. Using tools like a wireless adapter client utility or a spectrum 
analyzer will allow you to view different statistics that pertain to a wireless network. Some 
of these statistics are


Receive sensitivity


Radio frequency noise


Received signal strength indicator (RSSI)


Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
Receive Sensitivity
The basic deﬁ nition of receive sensitivity is the measurable amount of radio frequency 
signal usable by a receiver. This is also determined by how much radio frequency noise is 
in the area of the radio receiver. Figure 6.20 shows a wireless adapter client utility that dis-
plays statistics, including the strength of signal received.
Radio Frequency Noise
Radio frequency noise is the term for RF signals from sources other than the transmitter and 
receiver that are in communication. Here is an analogy to help explain. You and a guest are in 
a crowded open space restaurant for dinner. There are many unrelated conversations occurring 
at the same time at the various tables throughout the restaurant. If you and your dinner guest 
momentarily paused in your conversation, you would hear these other conversations, as well

as the noise from equipment, telephones, and tables that are being cleared. This would be the 
restaurant equivalent of radio frequency noise, as shown in Figure 6.21.

Chapter 6  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology
In a wireless LAN environment several RF devices may be operating in the same physi-
cal space as the wireless transmitter (access point) and receiver (client device). Depending 
on the level of this radio frequency noise, it may be difﬁ cult for the transmitter and receiver 
to understand each other. In Figure 6.22 a screen capture from a noise analyzer utility 
shows a wireless basic service set on channel 40 in the 5 GHz UNII-1 band. Also shown is 
the radio frequency noise ﬂ oor of about -95 dBm.
F I G U R E  6 . 2 2   The MetaGeek Chanalyzer Pro software utility shows a noise floor for 
the tested site of about -95 dBm.
Noise floor of
about −95 dBm
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is an arbitrary number assigned by the radio 
chipset or device manufacturer. There is no standard for this value, and it will not be com-
parable between devices from different manufacturers. The calculation of the RSSI value 
is done in a proprietary manner and a wireless device from one manufacturer may indicate 
different signal strength than that indicated by another, even though they both are receiv-
ing the exact same signal and at the same actual amount of radio frequency power. This 
value is a key determinant of how well the wireless LAN device will perform. How the 
device is used with the network will determine the required levels of signal for optimal con-
nectivity. Most wireless client device manufacturers allow their chipsets to access the higher 

Basic Units of Radio Frequency Measurement
201
data rates as long as they are getting a -70 dB signal or stronger. Wireless VoIP manufac-
turers recommend deploying so that the client devices can receive a -67 dB or better signal 
from the access point, a strength that is double the -70 dB required for higher data rate use 
due to the need for better signaling in QoS communications.
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the difference between the amount of received signal and 
the noise ﬂ oor. Looking back at the restaurant analogy, if you were to continue your con-
versation and the tables surrounding yours were all speaking at higher volumes, you might 
not be able to hear your dinner guest very well, because of the amount of noise created 
in the open area of your table. Looking at this from a wireless LAN perspective, if a 
client device records a received signal of –85 dBm and the noise ﬂ oor is –95 dBm, the 
signal-to-noise ratio will be 10 dB. This value is calculated by subtracting the received 
signal from the noise. In this case –85 dBm – (–95 dBm) = 10 dB. This would not be an 
adequate signal-to-noise ratio, because the receiver would have a difﬁ cult time determining 
the difference between the wanted RF signal and the surrounding RF noise. On the other 
hand, if the received signal is –65 dBm and the noise ﬂ oor is –95 dBm, then the signal-to-
noise ratio will be 30 dB. This value again is calculated by subtracting the received signal 
from the noise—in this case, –65 dBm - (–95 dBm) = 30 dB. This would be an excellent 
signal-to-noise ratio because the receiver would easily be able to determine the intended RF 
signal from the surrounding RF noise. Figure 6.23 illustrates the SNR as seen in a spec-
trum analyzer tool.

Then we described devices such as transmitters and receivers and how they communi-
cate. In wireless LAN technology, an example of a transmitter and receiver is an access 
point and client device. We also discussed the unlicensed RF bands and channels used in 
the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII ranges for wireless LAN communications as well as 
other frequency ranges that may be allowed for use with IEEE 80211 wireless networking 
depending on the local regulatory agency. Radio frequency coverage and capacity are two 
important areas that should be considered closely to ensure that a wireless deployment will 
offer reliable connectivity and perform well for the user base.
We then explained correct channel reuse to minimize interference from the co-location 
of access points. This chapter explored cause and effect of co-channel interference from 
sources other than wireless networks operating in the ISM and UNII bands. We also 
looked at RF behaviors such as reﬂ ection, refraction, and absorption, and the impact of 
building materials and the effect they have on the propagation of radio waves. We discussed

Antennas are an essential part of a successful wireless LAN 
deployment. From the transmitter perspective, an antenna 
takes the energy from the transmission system, transforms it 
into radio waves, and propagates it through the free air. From the receiver perspective, an 
antenna performs the opposite task—it receives the radio waves, transforms them back to 
AC signals, and ﬁ nally sends the information to a computer or other wireless device. 
Many factors are involved in determining the proper antenna to be used in an applica-
tion or deployment of a wireless LAN. These factors include:

Basic Radio Frequency Antenna 
Concepts
It is important to understand some of the basic theory, characteristics, and terminology 
associated with antennas prior to learning how they operate. Becoming familiar with this 
will help in making decisions when it comes to sales and support of antennas and wireless 
LAN systems. Some of the terminology for characteristics of antennas is listed here:
Radio Frequency lobes: Shape of the radiation patterns
Beamwidth: Horizontal and vertical angles

Basic Radio Frequency Antenna Concepts 
211
Antenna charts: Azimuth and elevation
Gain: Changing the radio frequency coverage pattern (beamwidths)
Polarization: Horizontal or vertical orientation
Radio Frequency Lobes
The term lobe has many meanings, depending on the context in which it is used. Typically it 
is used to deﬁ ne the projecting part of an object. In anatomical terms, an example would be 
part of the human ear known as the ear lobe. In botanical terms, a lobe is the divided part 
of a leaf. As a radio frequency technology term, lobe refers to the shape of the RF energy 
 emitted from an antenna element. RF lobes are determined by the physical design of the 
antenna. The antenna design also determines how the lobes project from an antenna element.
The effect of antenna design, particularly the shape of the RF lobes, is one reason 
why choosing the correct antenna is a critical part of a wireless LAN design. Antennas 
may project many lobes of RF signal, some of which are not intended to be usable areas 
of  coverage. The RF lobes that are not part of the main or intended lobe coverage—that 
is, the rear and side lobes—contain usable RF but are not intended to be used to provide 
 coverage for the wireless LAN cell. They are for the most part unintentional coverage areas 
and are not part of a good wireless LAN design and planned coverage area. The type of 
antenna utilized—omnidirectional, semidirectional, or highly directional—will determine 
the usable lobes. These antennas as well as the RF radiation patterns they project will be 
 discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Figure 7.1 shows an example of RF lobes 
emitted from an antenna element. The “main signal” is the lobe intended to be used.
F I G U R E 7.1  Radio frequency lobes’ shape and coverage area are affected by the type 
and design of an antenna.

Side lobes
Antenna Beamwidth
The design of an antenna will determine how radio frequencies propagate and the speciﬁ c 
patterns in which the energy propagates from an antenna element. As mentioned earlier, 
the patterns of energy emitted from an antenna are known as lobes. For antennas, the 

212
Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
beamwidth is the angle of measurement of the main RF lobe measured at what is called the 
half-power point, or –3 dB point. Beamwidth is measured both horizontally and vertically, 
in degrees. It is important to understand that antennas shape the RF coverage or isotropic 
energy that radiates from the antenna element. Changing types or remaining with the same 
type of antenna but changing the gain will also change the coverage area provided by the 
wireless LAN system.
Documents or antenna speciﬁ cations are available to illustrate the horizontal and 
vertical beamwidths. Azimuth and elevation charts available from the antenna manufac-
turer will show the beamwidth angles.
The azimuth refers to the horizontal RF coverage pattern, and the elevation is the ver-
tical RF coverage pattern. The azimuth is the view from above or the “bird’s-eye view” of 
the RF pattern; in some cases it will be 360°. Think of the elevation as a side view. If you 
were to look at a mountain from the side view, it would have a certain height or elevation 
measured in feet or meters. For example, Pikes Peak, a mountain in the front range of the 
Rocky Mountains, has an elevation of 14,115¢ (4,302 meters). Figure 7.2 shows a repre-
sentation of horizontal and vertical beamwidths. Some predictive modeling site survey 
software programs will allow the wireless LAN designer to adjust the azimuth and eleva-
tion of the antennas used in the predictive modeling design to more closely depict the real 
world coverage of the wireless LAN system. Wireless LAN site surveys and predictive 
modeling will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 11, “Performing an RF Wireless 
LAN Site Survey.”

Reading Azimuth and Elevation Charts
Understanding how to read an azimuth and elevation chart is useful from a technical 
sales, design, or integration perspective. Knowing these patterns will help when making 
hardware recommendations for customers based on needed coverage and device use. 
These charts show the angles of radio frequency propagation from both the azimuth 
(horizontal or looking down, top view) and the elevation (vertical or side view). They give 
a general idea of the shape of the RF propagation lobe based on antenna design.
Antenna manufacturers test antenna designs in a laboratory. Using the correct instru-
ments, an engineer is able to create the azimuth and elevation charts. These charts show 
only approximate coverage area based on the readings taken during laboratory testing 
and do not take into consideration any environmental conditions such as obstacles or 
interference. The following image shows an example of an azimuth and elevation chart 
for a semidirectional antenna.

Understanding how to read one of these charts is not complicated. Notice that the chart 
is a circular pattern with readings from 0° to 360°, and there are many rings within these 
charts. The outermost ring shows the strongest signal from the testing process of this 
antenna. The inner rings show measurements and dB ratings less than the strongest 
measured signal from the outside ring. A good chart will show the most accurate read-
ings from the testing process. A sales or technical support professional can use these 
charts to get an idea of how the radiation pattern would look based on a speciﬁ c antenna 
type and model.

Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
Antenna Gain
The gain of an antenna provides a change in coverage that is a result of the antenna 
focusing the area of radio frequency propagation. This gain is produced from the physi-
cal design of the antenna element. In Chapter 6, “Radio Frequency Fundamentals for 
Wireless LAN Technology,” we looked at various characteristics of radio frequency. 
One of these characteristics is amplitude, which was deﬁ ned as the height (voltage level) 
or the amount of power of a sine wave. The amplitude is created by varying voltage 
over a period of time and is measured at the peaks of the signal from top to bottom. 
Ampliﬁ cation of an RF  signal will result in gain. An antenna is a device that can change 
the coverage area, thus propagating an RF signal further. Antenna gain is measured in 
decibels isotropic (dBi), which is a change in power as a result of increasing the isotropic 
energy. Isotropic energy is deﬁ ned as energy emitted equally in all directions. The sun is 
a good example of isotropic energy, emitting energy in a spherical fashion equally in all 
directions. Figure 7.3 illustrates energy being emitted from an isotropic radiator.
F I G U R E  7. 3   A perfect isotropic radiator emits energy equally in all directions.
Passive Gain
It’s quite intriguing how an antenna can provide passive gain, a change in coverage with-
out the use of an external power source. Because of how antennas are designed, they 
focus isotropic energy into a speciﬁ c radiation pattern. Focusing this energy increases 
coverage in a particular direction. A common example used to describe passive gain is 
a magnifying glass. If a person is standing outside on a beautiful sunny day, the sun’s 
energy is not intense because it is being diffused across the entire earth’s hemisphere. 
Thus, there is not enough concentrated energy to cause any harm or damage in a short 
period of time. However, if this person were to take a magnifying glass and point one 
side of it toward the sun and the other side toward a piece of paper, more than likely the 
paper would start to heat quickly. This is because the convex shape of the magnifying 
glass focuses or concentrates the sun’s energy into one speciﬁ c area, thus increasing the 
amount of heat to that area.

Basic Radio Frequency Antenna Concepts 
215
Antennas are designed to function in the same way by focusing the energy they 
receive from a signal source into a specific RF radiation pattern. Depending on the 
design of the antenna element, as the gain of an antenna increases, both the hori-
zontal and vertical radiation patterns (beamwidths) will decrease or create narrower 
beamwidths. Conversely, as the gain of an antenna decreases, the beamwidths will 
increase, making a larger radiation pattern. One exception to this behavior is the 
omnidirectional antenna. This type of antenna has a horizontal beamwidth of 360°. 
When the gain is increased or decreased, the beamwidth will remain 360° but the 
size of this coverage area will increase or decrease depending on the change in the 
gain. Omnidirectional antennas are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 
Figure 7.4 shows a drawing of a wireless LAN system with 100 mW of RF power at 
the antenna. Because of passive gain, the antenna has the effect of emitting 200 mW 
of RF power.
F I G U R E  7. 4   An access point supplying 100 mW of RF power and an antenna with

RF power at the 
antenna = 100mW
RF power out of 
antenna = 200mW
It is important to understand that many local radio frequency regula-
tory domains or agencies restrict the amount of RF power that can be 
emitted from an unlicensed RF system. This “system” includes all the 
components certified by the local regulatory agency and may include 
the transmitter (access point), the connectors, and the antenna. Chang-
ing and increasing the gain of an antenna will increase the amount of 
 effective RF energy leaving the antenna and may violate the regulations 
set forth by the local regulatory agency and void the certification. The 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has modified what it allows 
several times, to the point of much confusion for installers trying to 
remain compliant with the regulations. Additionally, altering the original 
design in any way may require the entire system to be recertified based 
on the laws in each RF agency and that agency's interpretation of the 
term licensed system.

216
Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
Exercise 7.1 is a simple way to demonstrate passive gain.
E X E R C I S E  7.1
Demonstrating Passive Gain
You can demonstrate passive gain by using a standard 8.5” ¥ 11.0” piece of note-
book paper or cardstock.
1. Roll a piece of paper into a cone or funnel shape.
2. Speak at your normal volume and notice the sound of your voice as it propagates 
through the air.
3. Hold the cone-shaped paper in front of your mouth.
4. Speak at the same volume.
5. Notice that the sound of your voice is louder. This occurs because the sound is now 
focused into a speciﬁ c area or radiation pattern, and passive gain occurs.
Active Gain
Active gain will also provide an increase in signal strength. In a wireless LAN sys-
tem, active gain is accomplished by providing an external power source to an installed 
device. An example of such a device is an ampliﬁ er. An ampliﬁ er is placed in series in the 
wireless LAN system and will increase the signal strength based on how much gain it 
provides. 
If an ampliﬁ er is used in a wireless LAN system, certain regulatory domains require that 
the ampliﬁ er be certiﬁ ed as part of the system. It is best to carefully consider whether an 
ampliﬁ er is necessary before using such a device in an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN system. 
Using an ampliﬁ er may nullify the system’s certiﬁ cation and potentially exceed the allowed 
RF limit.
Antenna Polarization
Antenna polarization describes how a wave is emitted from an antenna and the orientation of 
the electrical component or electric ﬁ eld of the waveform. To maximize radio frequency sig-
nals, the transmitting and receiving antennas should be polarized in the same direction or as 
closely as possible. Antennas polarized the same way ensure the best possible RF signal.
If the polarization of the transmitter and receiver are different, the power of the RF 
signal will decrease depending how different the polarization is. Figure 7.5 shows an 
example of horizontal and vertical polarized antennas.
With the large number of wireless LAN devices available, it is a challenging task to 
accomplish the same polarization for all devices on the network. Performing a wireless LAN 
site survey will show signal strength based on several factors, including polarization of access

point antennas. This survey will help determine the received signal strength of the wireless 
LAN devices. Site surveys and antenna polarization are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11.

Antenna Polarization Example
It is fairly simple to demonstrate antenna polarization with a notebook computer or other 
wireless LAN device and either a wireless network adapter client utility or other third-
party software that shows signal strength and/or signal to noise ratio. One such utility is 
InSSIDer, a free open source Wi-Fi network scanner for Windows XP and above. You can 
ﬁ nd how to access the InSSIDer program at the download page for this book, www.sybex
.com/go/cwts2e. InSSIDer displays the received signal strength from the access points in 
the receiver area.
You can visualize polarization by performing the following steps. This experiment should 
be performed using a notebook computer within close proximity to an access point.
1. Verify that you have a supported wireless network adapter.
2. Install and launch the InSSIDer program or other utility that shows signal strength.
3. Monitor the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value.
4. While monitoring the RSSI value, change the orientation of the notebook computer.
5. Notice the change in the RSSI value (either an increase or decrease) when the orien-
tation of the computer changes with respect to the access point.
This demonstrates how polarity can affect the received signal of a device.

Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
Wireless LAN Antenna Types
The type of antenna that is best for a particular installation or application will depend on 
the desired radio frequency coverage pattern. Making the correct choice is part of a good 
wireless LAN design. Using the wrong type of antenna can cause undesirable results, such 
as interference to neighboring systems, poor signal strength, or incorrect coverage pattern 
for your design.
Three common types of antennas for use with wireless LANs are:


Omnidirectional/dipole antennas


Semidirectional antennas


Highly directional antennas
This section describes each type of antenna in more detail and provides speciﬁ cations 
and installation or conﬁ guration information about these antennas.
Omnidirectional Antennas
Omnidirectional antennas are common on most access points of either SOHO or enterprise 
grade. An omnidirectional antenna has a horizontal beamwidth (azimuth) of 360°. This 
means that when the antenna is vertically polarized (perpendicular to the earth’s surface) 
the horizontal radiation pattern is 360° and will propagate RF energy in every direction 
horizontally. The vertical beamwidth (elevation) will vary depending on the antenna’s gain. 
As the gain of the antenna increases, the horizontal radiation pattern will increase, provid-
ing more horizontal coverage. Keep in mind the beamwidth is still 360°, but it will be a 
larger 360° area that is covered because of the higher gain of the antenna. However, the 
vertical radiation pattern will decrease, thus providing less vertical coverage.
The shape of the radiation pattern from an omnidirectional antenna looks like a donut 
and is known as a torus. Figure 7.6 shows an example of the toroidal radiation pattern of 
an omnidirectional antenna.
F I G U R E  7.6   The omnidirectional radiation pattern has a toroidal shape.

Wireless LAN Antenna Types
219
Omnidirectional antennas are one of the most common types of antenna for indoor 
wireless LAN deployments. Most access points use omnidirectional antennas. Access 
points come with ﬁ xed, removable, or integrated antennas. If the antenna is removable, the 
installer can replace it with one of different gain. Enterprise-grade access points typically 
have removable antennas that are sold separately.
Some regulatory domains require the use of proprietary connectors with respect to anten-
nas. These connectors limit access points to the speciﬁ c antennas tested with the  system.
Therefore, it is best to consult with the manufacturer of the access point or other wireless 
LAN transmitting device to determine which antennas may be used with the system.
The most common type of omnidirectional antenna used indoors is known as the “rubber 
duck antenna.” This type of antenna typically has a low gain of 2 dBi to 3 dBi and connects 
directly to an access point. Rubber duck antennas usually have a pivot point so the polariza-
tion can be adjusted vertically or horizontally regardless of how the access point is mounted.
Some antennas will operate in both the 2.4 GHz ISM band and the 5 GHz UNII band 
and can thus work with a multiband wireless device.
Figure 7.7 shows a rubber duck omnidirectional antenna.

frequency radiation pattern emitted from the antenna. This is useful for a wireless LAN 
professional to determine the approximate RF propagation pattern. The purpose of these 
charts, and how to read them, were explained in the Case Study “Reading Azimuth and 
Elevation Charts” earlier in this chapter. Figure 7.9 shows the charts for a rubber duck

Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
Semidirectional Antennas
Semidirectional antennas take radio frequency power from the transmitting system and focus 
it into a more speciﬁ c pattern than an omnidirectional antenna offers. Semidirectional anten-
nas are available in various types, including patch, panel, sector, and Yagi. These antennas 
are manufactured for either indoor or outdoor use and are designed to provide more speciﬁ c 
coverage by focusing the horizontal radiation pattern to a value of less than 360°. A semidi-
rectional antenna will allow the wireless LAN designer to provide RF coverage to a speciﬁ c 
area within a deployment. This coverage area may consist of rooms or areas in which an 
omnidirectional antenna may not be the perfect solution. For indoor installations, such areas 
include rectangular rooms or ofﬁ ces, hallways, and long corridors. For outdoor deployments, 
they include point-to-point and point-to-multipoint bridging installations.
Patch/Panel Antennas
In the wireless LAN world, the terms patch and panel are commonly used to describe the 
same type of antenna. The intended use will affect the choice of patch/panel antenna to 
be used in a speciﬁ c application. Choosing the correct patch/panel antenna will require 
knowing the dimensions of the physical area to be covered as well as the amount of gain 
required. A patch/panel antenna can have a horizontal beamwidth of as high as 180°, but 
usually the horizontal beamwidth is between 35° and 60°. The vertical beamwidth usually 
ranges between 30 ° and 80°. Figure 7.10 shows a 2.4 GHz ﬂ at patch antenna. Sector anten-
nas are a type of semidirectional antenna that can be conﬁ gured in an array to provide 
omnidirectional coverage. Sector antennas are covered in more detail later in this chapter.

Appropriate Use of a Semidirectional Antenna
A small business consultant is tasked with providing wireless LAN access to several 
ofﬁ ces in a multi-tenant building. The client wants to provide adequate coverage for 
the ofﬁ ces they lease but would like to minimize the number of access points. The 
client wishes to use access points and antennas that are aesthetically pleasing, since 
these ofﬁ ces allow public access. The areas to be covered are rectangular, as shown 
here:
One solution would be to provide several access points using low-gain omnidirectional 
antennas. The following image illustrates how several access points could be used to 
provide coverage to this area.
However, the consultant believes that if low-gain rubber duck omnidirectional anten-
nas are used, an access point with signiﬁ cant output power would be required to cover 
the length of the rooms. In addition, the client wants to minimize the number of access 
points and make the installation aesthetically pleasing.

224
Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
An alternate solution is to use a patch antenna on both sides of the ofﬁ ce, thereby 
providing adequate coverage and minimizing the use of access points. The following 
image shows patch antennas mounted at both ends of the ofﬁ ce area as well as 
the projected coverage area of both antennas.
Patch/Panel Antenna Specifications
The speciﬁ cations for semidirectional antennas such as patch or panel vary based on the design 
of the antenna. Semidirectional antennas are available in single- or dual-band  capability. 
Semidirectional antennas may be used indoors or outdoors depending on the  application.

Sector Antennas
Sector antennas can be used to create omnidirectional radiation patterns using 
semidirectional antennas. These antennas are often used for base station connectivity for 
point-to-multipoint connectivity. Sector antennas have an azimuth that varies from 90° to 
180°. These are typically conﬁ gured to offer a total azimuth of 360°. For example, using 
sector antennas with an azimuth of 120° each would require three antennas in order to 
get omnidirectional or 360° coverage. This is a common conﬁ guration used with cellular 
phone technology. Figure 7.12 shows a sector panel antenna.

Sector Antenna Specifications
As mentioned earlier, sector antennas are commonly conﬁ gured in an array to allow 
semidirectional antennas to provide omnidirectional coverage. This is useful in a campus 
environment or community arrangement to provide wireless LAN access such as Internet 
access. Sector antennas will usually have wide horizontal beamwidth (azimuth) and a 
narrow vertical beamwidth (elevation). Table 7.3 is an example of a speciﬁ cation sheet for a

Yagi Antennas
Yagi antennas are designed to be used indoors in long hallways and corridors, or outdoors 
for short-range bridging (typically less than two miles). Yagi antennas have vertical and 
horizontal beamwidths ranging from 25° to 65°. The radiation pattern may look like a 
funnel or a cone. As the signal propagates away from the antenna, the RF coverage natu-
rally widens (diffusion). The aperture of the receiving antenna is much narrower than the 
signal at that point. This is a result of diffusion, which is the biggest form of loss in an RF 
link. Figure 7.14 shows a Yagi antenna.

Outdoor Installation of Yagi Antennas
A Yagi antenna may be in a weatherproof enclosure. This is not required but may be 
useful in outdoor installations. The weatherproof enclosure will prevent collection of 
certain elements such as snow and ice. Radome covers are available for parabolic dish 
antennas for the same purpose.
Highly Directional Antennas
Highly directional antennas are typically parabolic dish antennas used for long-range 
point-to-point bridge connections. These antennas are available with a solid reﬂ ector or a 
grid. Some manufacturers of parabolic dish antennas advertise ranges of 25 miles or more 
depending on the gain and the environmental conditions. Parabolic dish antennas have 
very narrow horizontal and vertical beamwidths. This beamwidth can range from 3° to 
15° and has a radiation pattern similar to that of a Yagi, with the appearance of a funnel. 
The beamwidth starts very narrow at the antenna element and naturally widens because 
of diffusion. Because these antennas are designed for outdoor use, they will need to be 
manufactured to withstand certain environmental conditions, including a wind rating and 
appropriate mounting. Grid antennas can provide similar coverage and are less susceptible 
to wind loading. Figure 7.16 shows a parabolic dish antenna.

Radio Frequency Cables and Connectors
233
Shipping a Parabolic Dish Antenna
One thing to consider regarding the sale and procurement of a highly directional para-
bolic dish antenna is the size and shipping weight. Since these antennas are much larger 
and heavier than other antennas used in wireless LANs, shipping cost may be a factor. 
Some speciﬁ cation sheets will detail shipping information for this reason.
Radio Frequency Cables and Connectors
Radio frequency cables play a role in various wireless LAN deployment situations. For 
example, cables may be used to connect access points and client devices to antennas 
or to connect other devices that may used in wireless networking. Several factors need 
to be taken into consideration when using cables in a wireless LAN system, including 
these:


Type of cable


Length of cable


Cost of cable


Impedance rating
Choosing the correct cable for use in wireless LAN systems is an important part of a 
successful wireless LAN deployment. The right cable for the right job will help ensure that 
signal loss—a decrease in signal strength—is minimized and performance is maximized.
Radio Frequency Cable Types
The type of cable used will depend on the application. Many systems use cables to 
extend from the wireless device such as an access point to an antenna located outside 
of a building. It is important to choose the correct type of cable in order to optimize 
the performance of the wireless LAN system. Cables vary in diameter, and the applica-
tion will determine the type of cable to use. For example, connecting a wireless LAN 
adapter on a notebook computer to an external antenna requires a speciﬁ c type of cable 
that should be short and ﬂ exible. Thick, rigid cables are best used for longer runs. The 
radio frequency range in which the cable will be used also is important to consider. 
Where the cable is used will determine the radio frequency rating of the cable. For 
example, wireless LANs use 50 ohm cable, whereas television (such as satellite and 
cable) will use 75 ohm cable. Using cable with the correct rating will minimize voltage 
standing wave ratio (VSWR), a phenomenon discussed in the section “Impedance and 
VSWR.” Figure 7.18 shows a spool of high-quality 50 ohm cable.

234
Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories

Radio Frequency Cable Length
The length of a cable used in a wireless LAN system is another factor to consider. A cable 
of even a very short length will have some level of attenuation or loss. As a reminder, 
loss is a decrease in signal strength. This decrease in signal strength means less overall 
performance and throughput for users of the wireless LAN. Professionally manufactured 
cables typically are available in many standard common lengths. Best practices recom-
mend using the correct length and minimizing connections. For example, if a run from an 
access point to an external antenna is 27', it would be best to use a single cable as close to 
that length as possible. Connecting two or more pieces of cable together will increase the 
loss to the system. One might be tempted to use a longer piece, such as 50', but this is not 
recommended since the extra length will add loss to the system. 
Figure 7.19 shows a short length of cable known as a pigtail used to connect a  standard 
cable to a proprietary cable. If an RF cable is used or extended, the attenuation that 
is introduced can be offset with the use of an ampliﬁ er or with a higher-gain antenna. 
An ampliﬁ er will provide active gain and an antenna will provide passive gain. Keep in 
mind that using an incorrect ampliﬁ er may void the system certiﬁ cation and that using a 
higher-gain antenna may exceed the rules set by the local RF regulatory agency.
Radio Frequency Cable Cost
Cable cost may also play a role in the type of cable to be used. The old saying “you get 
what you pay for” is true with cables as well. I recommend using high-quality name-brand 

Radio Frequency Cables and Connectors

RF cables to optimize the performance of your system. Premium cables may come at a 
higher price, but the beneﬁ t of better quality signal is the main advantage.

Impedance and VSWR
Impedance is the measurement of alternating current (AC) resistance. It is  normal 
to have some level of impedance mismatch in a wireless LAN system, but the 
impedances of all components should be matched as closely as possible in order 
to optimize performance of the system. Impedance mismatches can result in what 
is called voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR). A large impedance mismatch can 
cause high level of VSWR and will have an impact on the wireless LAN system and 
transmitted or received signal.
Electrical resistance is measured in ohms. IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN devices have an 
impedance of 50 ohms.
Radio Frequency Connectors
In a wireless LAN system, radio frequency connectors are used to join devices together, 
allowing the RF signal to transfer between the devices. These devices may connect access 
point to antenna, antenna to cable, cable to cable, or various other components to each 
other. RF connectors also cause an impedance mismatch to some degree and increase the 
level of VSWR. To minimize the effects of VSWR, best practices suggest keeping the use of 
connectors to a minimum. Using connectors can also result in insertion loss. Insertion loss 
is usually minor by itself, but it can contribute to overall loss in a system, thereby resulting 
in less RF signal and less throughput.

236
Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
Using Proprietary Connectors for Regulatory Domain Compliance
Some regulatory domains require the use of proprietary connectors on antennas 
and antenna connections in wireless LAN systems. These proprietary connec-
tors prevent an installer or integrator from unintentionally using an antenna that 
might exceed the maximum amount of power allowed for the transmission system. 
Although these connectors are considered proprietary, many manufacturers share 
proprietary connectors:


MC connectors are used by Dell, Buffalo, IBM, Toshiba, and Proxim-ORiNOCO.


MMCX connectors are used by 3Com, Cisco, Proxim, Samsung, Symbol, and 
Motorola.


MCX connectors are used by Apple and SMC devices.


RP-MMCX connectors are used by SMC devices.
Standard RF connectors may be used in wireless LAN systems to connect devices 
that are not part of the point connecting to the antenna. For example, an access point 
connecting to a length of cable that is then connected to an ampliﬁ er could use a standard 
RF connector. The cable connecting the ampliﬁ er to the antenna would require a propri-
etary connector. Figure 7.20 shows examples of common RF connectors.

Factors in Antenna Installation
237
Factors in Antenna Installation
Several factors are important to consider when you are planning to install a wireless net-
work. These include earth curvature, multipath, and radio frequency line of sight. This 
section includes information about how to take these factors into account when planning a 
wireless installation.
Addressing the Effects of Earth Curvature
Beyond seven miles, the curvature of the earth will have an impact on point-to-point or 
point-to-multipoint wireless LAN connections. Therefore, it is important to add height to 
the antenna in order to compensate for the earth curvature, sometimes referred to as earth 
bulge. A formula is used to calculate the additional height of antennas when a link exceeds 
seven miles. However, this is beyond the scope of the CWTS exam objectives and is not dis-
cussed in this book.
Antenna Placement
The installation location and placement of antennas depend on the type of antenna and 
application in which it will be used. When installing antennas, consider the placement 
based on the design of the wireless LAN and the intended use of the antenna. When anten-
nas are used outdoors, lightning arrestors, grounding, and adherence to local codes, laws, 
and government regulations must be followed as well as good RF design. Increasingly, local 
ordinances dictate how or if outdoor antennas can be mounted for looks as well as safety. 
Lightning arrestors and grounding methods are discussed later in this section.
Omnidirectional Antenna Placement
Placement of an omnidirectional antenna will depend on the intended use. Some omni-
directional antennas can be connected directly to an access point or may be integrated 
within the access point. In this conﬁ guration, the installation is fairly straightforward; it 
involves simply attaching the antenna to the access point or using the integrated antenna. 
Omnidirectional antennas are usually placed in the center of the intended coverage area. 
High-gain omnidirectional antennas are typically used in outdoor installations for point-
to-multipoint conﬁ gurations. This conﬁ guration is more complex because more than likely 
it requires mast or tower mounting. The exact placement depends on the intended coverage 
area as well as the gain of the antenna.
Semidirectional Antenna Placement
Semidirectional antennas may be used for either outdoor or indoor installations. When 
mounted indoors, a patch/panel antenna typically will be mounted ﬂ at on a wall with 
the connector upward for connections to a cable or directly to an access point. A tem-
plate with the hole placement may be included for ease of installation. These  antennas 
usually will use four mounting holes (one in each corner) to securely fasten the antenna 

238
Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
to the wall. Yagi antennas can also be mounted either indoors or outdoors. The most 
common installation is outdoors for short-range point-to-point or  point-to-multipoint 
bridging solutions. This will require a mounting bracket such as a tilt and swivel for 
wall mounting or U-bolts and plate for mast or pole mounting.
Highly Directional Antenna Placement
Highly directional antennas such as a parabolic dish are almost always used exclusively in 
outdoor installations. This type of antenna is used mostly for long-range point-to-point bridg-
ing links and will require installation on building rooftops or antenna towers. Alignment 
for long-range links is critical for reliable communications. Software and hardware tools are 
available for the installer to use for accurate alignment. As with other outdoor installations, 
secure mounting is essential in order to maintain safety and link reliability.
Minimizing the Effects of Multipath 
Using Antenna Diversity
In Chapter 6, we discussed some of the behaviors of radio frequency, including reﬂ ec-
tion, refraction, scattering, and diffraction. To review, reﬂ ection is caused by an RF signal 
bouncing off a smooth, nonabsorptive surface and changing direction. Indoor environ-
ments are areas that are prone to reﬂ ections. Reﬂ ections are caused by the RF signal 
bouncing off walls, ceilings, ﬂ oors, and furniture; thus some installations will suffer from 
reﬂ ection more than others. The effect of reﬂ ection will be a decrease in signal strength 
due to a phenomenon called multipath. Multipath is the result of several wavefronts of the 
same transmission signal received out of phase at slightly different times. This can cause the 
receiver to be confused about the received signals. The result is corrupted signal and less 
overall throughput. Figure 7.21 illustrates multipath.
F I G U R E  7. 21   Effects of multipath
Receiver

Combating Effects of Wind and Lightning in WLAN Installations 
239
Think of multipath as an echo. If you were to stand near a canyon and 
speak to somebody at a high volume some distance away, the other per-
son would notice an echo. This echo is due to the fact that the sound of 
your voice is reflecting off the canyon walls. Therefore, the other person is 
hearing variations of your voice at slightly different times—as with RF mul-
tipath, several wavefronts of the same signal are arriving out of phase.
Antenna diversity is one way to help reduce the effects of multipath. Antenna diver-
sity is a technology used in wireless LANs where a station (access point or client device) 
will utilize two antennas combined with one radio to decrease the effects of multipath. 
Using multiple antennas and some additional electronic intelligence, the receiver will be 
able to determine which antenna will receive and send the best signal. In diversity sys-
tems, two antennas are spaced at least one wavelength apart. This allows the receiver 
to use the antenna with the best signal to transmit and receive. With respect to radio 
frequency diversity, the antennas are required to be of the same design, frequency, gain, 
and so on.
Diversity Antenna Orientation
When you are using a diversity system such as an access point, it is important to have 
both antennas oriented the same way. They cannot be used to cover different areas. 
Using diversity antennas in an attempt to provide coverage for different areas will defeat 
the purpose of the diversity design.
Combating Effects of Wind and 
Lightning in WLAN Installations
Weather conditions such as rain, snow, and sleet typically do not affect wireless LAN 
 communications unless the conditions are extreme or snow and sleet collect on antenna 
 elements. However, some weather conditions that can affect wireless communication are 
wind and lightning.
Most outdoor antennas that can be affected by wind will have wind-loading data in the 
speciﬁ cation sheet. Wind loading is the result of wind blowing at high speeds and causing 
the antenna to move.
Lightning can destroy components connected to a network if the antenna takes 
either a direct or an indirect lightning strike. A properly grounded lightning arrestor 
will help  protect wireless LAN and other networking equipment from indirect lightning 
strikes.

240 
Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
Lightning Arrestors
Transient or induced electrical currents are the result of an indirect lightning strike in 
the area of a wireless LAN antenna system. Lightning arrestors are an in-series device 
installed after the antenna and prior to the transmitter/receiver. Although this device will 
not  provide protection from a direct lightning strike, it will help protect against an indirect 
lightning strike, which can damage electronics at distances away from the source of the 
strike. When the induced electrical currents from a lightning strike travel to the antenna, a 
lightning arrestor will shunt this excess current to ground, protecting the system from dam-
age. Figure 7.22 shows a lightning arrestor.

Grounding Rods
A grounding rod is a metal shaft used for grounding a device such as an antenna used in wire-
less networking. The rod should be driven into the ground at least 8' deep. Grounding rods are 
available in various types of steel, including stainless, galvanized, and copper clad. They are 
also available in a variety of diameters and lengths. Depending on the local electrical code, the 
grounding system should measure resistance between 5 and 25 ohms. Local code should also 
be consulted regarding material, diameter, and length of grounding rods. You should not share 
grounding rods with other equipment because interference or damage may occur.
It is imperative to install a grounding rod properly to ensure correct opera-
tion. If installing a grounding rod and other lightning protection equipment 
is beyond the knowledge level of the wireless engineer or installer, it is 
best to have a professional contractor perform the job.

Antenna Mounting
241
Installation Safety
Professional contractors should be considered in the event you are not comfortable with 
performing the installation of a wireless LAN antenna yourself. Installing antennas may 
require bonded or certiﬁ ed technicians. Be sure to check local building codes prior to per-
forming any installation of a wireless LAN antenna. Never underestimate safety when 
installing or mounting antennas. All safety precautions must be adhered to while perform-
ing an installation. The following are some general guidelines and precautions to be consid-
ered for a wireless LAN antenna installation:


Read the installation manual from the manufacturer.


Always avoid power lines. Contact with power lines can result in death.


Always use the correct safety equipment when working at heights.


Correctly install and use grounding rods when appropriate.


Comply with regulations for use in the area and for use of towers as well.
Antenna Mounting
In addition to choosing the correct antenna to be used with a wireless LAN system, you must 
take into account the antenna mounting. The required antenna mounting ﬁ xture will depend 
on the antenna type, whether it will be used indoors or outdoors, and whether it will be used 
for device/client access or bridging solutions such as point-to-point or point-to-multipoint. 
It is best to consult with the antenna or device manufacturer to determine which mounting 
ﬁ xture is appropriate for use based on the intended deployment scenario. The following are 
several mounting types that may be used for a wireless LAN antenna solution:


Internal and external (to the AP) antennas


Pole/mast mount


Ceiling mount


Wall mount
Internal and External (to the Access Point) Antennas
Some wireless access points allow the use of either integrated or external antennas. Most 
modern controller-based and cooperative access points provide integrated antennas, and 
some have connectors to allow for the use of external antennas. Integrated antennas may be 
a better solution, mostly to match the aesthetics requirements of the organization where the 
access point will be used. Integrated antennas make an access point less noticeable if it is 
hanging from a standard 8'–10' high ceiling. Integrating them will also prevent individuals 
from tampering with antennas that if external might be within a person’s reach. Tampering 
could be an issue in areas that are accessible to the general public, such as installations in 
educational, library, and medical environments.

242 
Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
It is important to take the mounting orientation into consideration when using access 
points with integrated antennas. The access point may be designed to be mounted on a ceil-
ing. If you were to mount this type of access point on a wall, the radiation patterns would 
change, and this might create a coverage problem, especially with omnidirectional antennas. 
One disadvantage of access points with integrated antennas is that the antennas  cannot 
be changed to any other type. Basically you would be committed to using the antennas that 
are part of the access point and would be unable to add an antenna with higher gain or a 
different radiation pattern. Access points that have external antenna connectors allow the 
user to add different antennas that may be better suited to the environment or installation 
location. The external antennas will allow for a higher gain and possibly a different radia-
tion pattern. Using an external antenna usually requires a software conﬁ guration that will 
disable the integrated antenna when external antennas are installed. You should not be able 
to use both the integrated and external antennas simultaneously. Many indoor access point 
models that use internal antennas offer the same coverage as their external antenna model 
counterparts This, however, will vary based on the manufacturer.
When using wireless access points with integrated antennas, it is impor-
tant to take the mounting into consideration. Some access points of this 
style are intended to be mounted on a ceiling or a wall, but not both. 
Mounting an antenna in a way it is not designed for will produce undesir-
able results, including radio frequency coverage problems.
Pole/Mast Mount
Pole/mast mounts typically consist of a mounting bracket and U-bolt mounting hardware. The 
mounting bracket is commonly L-shaped. One side of the bracket has a hole to mount an omni-
directional or similar antenna. The other side of the bracket has predrilled holes for fastening 
the bracket to a pole using U-bolts. Figure 7.23 shows an example of a heavy-duty mast mount.

Exercise 7.2 describes the basic steps for installing an omnidirectional antenna using a 
mast mount adapter.
E X E R C I S E  7. 2
Installing a Pole/Mast Mount
1. Attach the mounting bracket to the mast using the supplied hardware.
2. Remove the antenna mounting bolt and washer from the base of the antenna.
3. Insert the antenna into the hole in the top of the mounting bracket. Without overtight-
ening, securely fasten the antenna to the mounting bracket using the washer and 
antenna mounting bolt.
4. For outdoor installations, remember to use the proper sealant for weatherprooﬁ ng 
when connecting the cable to the antenna.
Ceiling Mount
It may be necessary to mount certain antennas or access points with attached or 
integrated antennas from a ceiling. Many antennas can be mounted directly to a hard 
ceiling made from concrete, drywall, or similar material. Another possibility is a

the manufacturer’s instructions on the appropriate ﬁ xture to be used for mounting 
and detailed instructions for ceiling mounts. Figure 7.24 shows an example of a ceiling

Chapter 7  Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories
Wall Mount
Antennas or access points with attached antennas may need to be mounted to a wall based 
on the use or site survey results. Just as with a ceiling mount, follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions on the appropriate ﬁ xture for wall mounting. When mounting an antenna 
to the wall, consider the polarization of the antenna. Keep in mind that some antennas 
are designed to be mounted on the ceiling; these types should not be mounted on a wall. 
This is especially true for access points with integrated antennas. It is best to try to match 
the polarization of the access points and the wireless client devices. In other words, if the 
access point’s antennas are vertically polarized, the wireless client devices should be polar-
ized in the same manner to promote better connectivity. However, with the wide variety 
of newer wireless client devices available this is getting harder to achieve. Choosing the 
correct antenna and mounting position is typically part of a wireless LAN site survey. Site 
surveys will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 11.
Maintaining Clear Communications
Several factors affect whether two wireless devices can communicate with each other. 
These factors include line of sight (both visual and RF) and Fresnel zone. Indoor wireless 
LAN installations use a low amount of radio frequency transmit power, usually around 
30 mW to 50 mW, and will be able to communicate effectively even if the client device 
does not have a line of sight with an access point. This is because the RF will be able to 
penetrate obstacles such as walls, windows, and doors. Outdoor installations usually use 
a much higher output transmit power and will require an RF line of sight for effective 
communication.
Visual Line of Sight
Visual line of sight (LoS) is deﬁ ned as the capability of two points to have an unobstructed 
view of one another. A visual LoS is usually not necessary for communications using IEEE 
802.11 wireless LAN systems; it is implied with RF LoS. If a wireless LAN engineer was 
planning to connect two buildings together using wireless LAN technology, one of the ﬁ rst 
things the engineer would do is to verify that there is a clear, unobstructed view between 
the planned locations in order to provide an RF LoS. 
Radio Frequency LoS
For two devices to successfully communicate at a distance via radio frequency, including a 
point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connection, a clear path for the RF energy to travel 
between the two points is necessary. This clear path is called RF LoS. This RF LoS is the 
premise of the Fresnel zone.

Maintaining Clear Communications
245
Fresnel Zone
The Fresnel zone for an RF signal is the area of radio frequency coverage surrounding the 
visual LoS. The width or area of the Fresnel zone will depend on the speciﬁ c radio fre-
quency used as well as the length or distance of the signal path. There is a formula used 
to calculate the width of the Fresnel zone at the widest point. However, that is beyond the 
scope of the CWTS exam objectives and is not shown in this book.
In an outdoor point-to-point or point-to-multipoint installation, it is important for the 
Fresnel zone to be clear of obstructions for successful communications to take place between 
a radio frequency transmitter and receiver. Best practices recommend maintaining an 
obstruction-free clearance of the least 60 percent for the Fresnel zone in order to have accept-
able RF LoS. Maintaining a clear RF LoS becomes more difﬁ cult as the distance between two 
points increases. Obstructions can cause the Fresnel zone to be blocked enough for communi-
cations to suffer between a transmitter and receiver. Such obstructions include:


Trees


Buildings or other structures


Earth curvature


Natural elements such as hills and mountains
Figure 7.25 illustrates the Fresnel zone between two highly directional antennas.

In order to stay clear of obstructions, carefully plan your antenna placement and 
antenna height. Keep in mind that a wireless LAN link may cross public areas in which 
an integrator or installer will have no control over the environment. There is a possibility, 
depending on the environmental conditions, that an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN link may 
not be a feasible solution due to the inability to maintain an RF LoS. You should perform

an outdoor site survey prior to the procurement and installation of wireless LAN hardware 
to ensure the installation and operation of the wireless LAN will be successful.
Summary
Antennas are a critical component in a successful operation of a wireless LAN. In this 
chapter, you learned about radio frequency signal characteristics and basic RF antenna con-
cepts, including these:


Radio frequency lobes


Beamwidth (horizontal and vertical measurements)


Passive and active gain


Horizontal and vertical polarization of antennas
By understanding these characteristics and concepts, a sales engineer, integrator, or other 
wireless LAN professional can help choose the best antenna to be used for a speciﬁ c use.
Understanding the radio frequency propagation patterns of various antenna types as well 
as the recommended use of an antenna will assist in deciding which antenna is best suited for 
the desired application. As discussed in this chapter, antennas are available in various types:


Omnidirectional


Semidirectional


Patch/panel


Sector


Yagi


Highly directional


Parabolic dish
Omnidirectional antennas are one of the most common types of antenna used for 
indoor applications of wireless networking. Omnidirectional antennas provide a horizontal 
radiation pattern of 360°. Other antennas such as patch/panel, Yagi, or parabolic dish can 
be used if justiﬁ ed by the intended use. You learned about the radiation patterns of each of 
these types of antennas as well as how each may be used.
A proper mounting ﬁ xture is required to ensure safety and correct operation of the 
antenna and wireless network. In this chapter we looked at various methods for mounting 
antennas, including integrated and external (to the access point), pole/mast mount, ceiling 
mount, and wall mount.
Finally, you learned about other factors to be considered when choosing and installing 
an antenna for use with wireless LANs. The other areas of concerns are:

THE FOLLOWING CWTS EXAM OBJECTIVES 
ARE COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:


 Protection mechanisms

This chapter will look at some of the terminology used in 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. 802.11 wireless LANs may 
be conﬁ gured in one of two modes: ad hoc or infrastructure 
mode. We will discuss both of these modes, as well as how the technology is applied and its 
advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we will examine some of the technical aspects, 
such as naming the wireless LAN and identifying the devices through Layer 2 MAC 
addressing or logical names. You will also learn about the methodologies a wireless LAN 
device or client station uses to locate and connect to the wireless network (these include 
passive and active scanning as well as the authentication and association processes.
It is important to know how IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN infrastructure devices such as 
access points are connected using a common wired or wireless distribution system. This 
distribution system allows access points to communicate with each other and gives the 
associated and connected wireless LAN devices the capability to roam or move between 
access points and maintain consistent connectivity across the wireless LAN.
Other wireless LAN technology factors are important to understand when studying 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. This chapter will discuss the differences between data 
rates and throughput. A sales or technical support specialist should be able to understand 
and explain why, for example, an IEEE 802.11n access point advertises a maximum data 
rate of up to 600 Mbps but in many cases the data transfers are half or less than half of this 
advertised data transfer rate.
Finally, we will look at IEEE 802.11 protection mechanisms in depth and explain why 
they are needed for backward compatibility and the effect they may have on the data 
transfer rate.
Some of the topics we will see in this chapter have been brieﬂ y touched on in earlier chap-
ters. One of the objectives of this chapter is to tie the terminology and topics together. In 
wireless LAN technology education, it can be somewhat challenging to cover certain parts 
of the technology without touching lightly on some other topics. This chapter will tie some 
of the loose ends together and help you to better understand how IEEE 802.11 wireless net-
works operate.
Wireless LAN Modes of Operation
Wireless LANs can be conﬁ gured to operate in different modes for device and user access. 
Two common modes for access are ad hoc mode and infrastructure mode. These two 
modes can be broken down into three different conﬁ gurations:

Wireless LAN Modes of Operation
255


Independent basic service set (IBSS)


Basic service set (BSS)


Extended service set (ESS)
Each of these conﬁ gurations will be discussed in more detail in this chapter. The appli-
cation/deployment scenario for a wireless LAN is the determining factor for the best mode 
to use. The IBSS conﬁ guration does not require the use of an access point and unless spe-
ciﬁ cally justiﬁ ed is not commonly used in enterprise wireless LAN deployments. In addi-
tion, if not properly implemented the IBSS can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as 
potentially bridging the wired network infrastructure to an unsecured wireless network. 
The most common conﬁ guration for an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN is infrastructure mode, 
which uses at least one access point. Infrastructure mode requires a minimum of one access 
point but can consist of up to thousands of access points. The access points are connected 
by a common medium known as the distribution system. We will look at each of these 
modes and the details of how they are conﬁ gured.
The Independent Basic Service Set
It is important to understand what the independent basic service set (IBSS) is, how it 
works, and potential uses, advantages, and disadvantages. This wireless LAN opera-
tion mode uses no access points and consists of only wireless devices or client computers. 
Communication occurs only among devices that are part of the same IBSS. Unlike an 
access point, this mode has no centralized control or manageable security or accounting 
features. Figure 8.1 shows devices in an IBSS.

Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
Certain parameters must be set on the devices that wish to participate in an IBSS. These 
parameters must be the same on all the devices in order for them to effectively communi-
cate with one another. Three common parameters set on devices that belong to the same 
IBSS are:


Service set identifier (SSID)


Radio frequency channel


Security configuration
The Service Set Identifier
The service set identiﬁ er (SSID) is a common parameter used in all wireless LAN operation 
conﬁ gurations. Although it is discussed here, it also pertains to the other conﬁ gurations 
discussed later in this chapter, such as the basic service set (BSS) and extended service set 
(ESS). The SSID is the logical name of the service set used to identify the wireless network. 
The SSID is used by devices to select a wireless network to join. This is accomplished 
through processes that are known collectively as the discovery phase and include passive 
and active scanning, both of which will be discussed later in this chapter.
In some cases, naming a wireless network can be a tough decision. Organizations that 
deploy a wireless network may already have a naming convention in place for such 
scenarios. If not, a decision will need to be made regarding the wireless network names 
(SSIDs) used for access points and other devices to identify the wireless LAN.
Every device that wishes to be part of the same wireless LAN IBSS, BSS, or ESS will use 
a common network name, the SSID. (See Figure 8.2 for an IBSS example.) For infrastruc-
ture devices such as access points, the SSID parameter is manually set on the access point. 
From the client access side, the SSID is a user-conﬁ gurable parameter that can be set manu-
ally in the wireless client software utility or received automatically from networks that 
broadcast this information element.

The SSID name should be unique and should not divulge who you are or the location 
of the wireless LAN devices, unless you are trying to create a wireless hotspot or a public 
accessible IEEE 802.11 wireless network. For example, if a ﬁ ctitious bank by the name 
of ABC Bank used an SSID that included ABC_Bank, it would tell an intruder where the 
wireless network is and could be a potential security threat because a ﬁ nancial institution 
is a target. It is important to understand if the proper wireless LAN security is enabled, the 
SSID name should not be an issue, but there is no point in broadcasting certain types of 
information. Rather than using the bank name in the SSID, consider a unique name that 
does not describe the business or location.
The SSID is case sensitive and has a maximum limit of 32 characters or, as speciﬁ ed in 
the IEEE 802.11 standard, 32 octets.
SSID Hiding
Most manufacturers of small ofﬁ ce/home ofﬁ ce (SOHO) and enterprise-grade access 
points allow the SSID to be hidden from view for devices attempting to locate a wireless 
network. In this case a client device would need to know and specify the SSID in the cli-
ent utility proﬁ le in order to connect to the network. Even though this is not an effective 
way to secure a wireless network and should not be used to do so, it is a practice some 
choose to use for various reasons. Some disadvantages to not broadcasting the SSID 
are that it may cause an increase in roaming times in an enterprise deployment and in 
a SOHO deployment cause neighbors to deploy on the same channel that you are using 
because they are unable to see your network. SSID hiding (also known as a closed net-
work) will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9, “Wireless LAN Security Basics.”
Figure 8.3 shows an example of entering the SSID in the Microsoft Windows 7 
AutoConﬁ g wireless conﬁ guration client utility for an ad hoc network. First you select 
“Set up a wireless ad hoc (computer-to-computer) network” in the Set Up A Connection 
Or Network dialog box; then you enter the SSID on the “Give your network a name and 
choose security options” Properties page.
The Radio Frequency Channel
The IBSS wireless network conﬁ guration requires a user to set the speciﬁ c radio frequency 
channel that will be used by all devices that are part of the same IBSS network. This is 
accomplished in the client utility software for the network adapter. Some client software 
utilities set this automatically, in which case the IBSS will use the channel automatically 
speciﬁ ed. You may also be able to specify the RF channel in the advanced properties of the 
wireless network adapter device driver properties.
It is important to understand that all wireless devices in any common IBSS must be com-
municating on the same radio frequency channel. If the client utility does allow a channel 
to be set, the channel chosen is up to the user but based on the local regulatory domain 
in which the network is used. Additional devices wishing to join the IBSS must do so by

scanning, either passively or by use of active scanning. Figure 8.4 shows an example of set-
ting the RF channel on a notebook computer.

and passphrase (security key).
IBSS Security
With IBSS networks, there is no centralized control and no security management features. 
Security is left up to the individual user or wireless device. If a user inadvertently shares a 
resource, it could expose sensitive information and pose security threats. This can be a con-
cern for many enterprise installations, and therefore the use of an IBSS is against corporate 
security policy in many organizations.
IBSS Terminology
The wireless LAN industry uses several different terms to identify an IBSS. The term used 
is up to the manufacturer or a speciﬁ c implementation. An IBSS is usually identiﬁ ed by one 
of three terms:


Independent basic service set (IBSS)

Wireless LAN Modes of Operation
259


Ad hoc


Peer-to-peer

5100 IEEE 802.11a/g/n wireless network adapter driver Advanced settings page
Set the IBSS (ad hoc) radio frequency
channel number in the IEEE 802.11
wireless client adapter’s configuration. 
Regardless of the terminology used—IBSS, ad hoc, or peer-to-peer—it comes down to 
wireless LAN devices connecting to each other without the use of an access point or other 
wireless infrastructure device. All devices in an IBSS network work independently of one 
another, and there is no centralized management or administration capability. This type of 
connection may be useful in homes or small ofﬁ ces for ease of installation but is rarely if at 
all used with enterprise or corporate wireless networks.
Advantages and Disadvantages of an IBSS
The advantages and disadvantages of an IBSS network will vary depending on the 
application.
Some of the advantages of IBSS are as follows:
Easy to Configure  To create an IBSS, the user only needs to specify an SSID, set the radio 
frequency channel, and enable the security settings.
No Investment in Access Point Hardware  An IBSS can be created with the IEEE 802.11 
wireless LAN adapter that is built into the wireless computer or other device. No infra-
structure device such as an access point is required to connect the wireless LAN devices 
together.

260 
Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
Some disadvantages of IBSS are as follows:
Limited Radio Frequency Range  Because radio communications is two-way, all devices 
need to be in a mutual communication range of one another in order to operate effectively.
No Centralized Administration Capability  In many large or enterprise deployments, IBSS 
connectivity is against corporate security policy because it is impossible to manage such 
networks centrally.
Not Scalable  There is no set maximum number of devices that can be part of an IBSS net-
work, but the capacity of such networks is low compared to other types of networks.
Difficult to Secure  Some computer operating systems have made the setup of an IBSS 
wireless network very easy for any type of user. These users may inadvertently share or 
allow access to sensitive or proprietary information. This security threat is worse if an IBSS 
user is also physically connected to a wired network and provides a bridge from an unse-
cured or unmanaged wireless network to a company’s wired network infrastructure.
A wireless LAN device such as a notebook computer configured as an IBSS 
device can be a potential security threat if it is also connected to a wired 
network infrastructure. It could provide a bridge for unsecured wireless 
access to the company’s wired network. In this configuration, potential 
intruders would have access to information from a corporate network by 
connecting to the unsecured ad hoc network. For this reason, this type of 
configuration is against corporate security policies of many companies. 
Many organizations use wireless intrusion prevention systems to detect 
and shut down wireless ad hoc networks. It is important to inform visitors 
and contractors who may be physically connected to the company’s infra-
structure when ad hoc networks are against the corporate security policy 
to prevent potential security issues.
Setting up an IBSS network is similar to setting up a workgroup for an 
operating system such as Microsoft Windows. All devices with the same 
workgroup name will be able to communicate with each other sharing 
resources such as files, printers, and so on.
The Basic Service Set
The basic service set (BSS) is the foundation of the wireless network. This mode con-
sists of an access point connected to a network infrastructure and its associated wireless 
devices. This is considered the foundation because it may be one of many access points 
that form a wireless network. With a BSS setup, each access point is connected to a net-
work infrastructure, also known as the distribution system (DS), which allows connected 

Wireless LAN Modes of Operation 
261
wireless LAN devices to access network resources based on the appropriate permissions 
the wireless device or user has access to. The radio frequency area of coverage depends 
on several factors, such as the antenna gain and RF output power settings; this area of 
coverage is known as the basic service area (BSA). Any IEEE 802.11 wireless device in 
radio range and part of the BSA with the correct conﬁ guration parameters, including the 
SSID and security settings, will be able to successfully connect to the access point. Figure 
8.5 shows an example of a BSS.

Access point
As mentioned earlier, infrastructure mode consists of a wireless access point connected 
to a distribution system. The BSS consisting of one access point is a common implementa-
tion in many homes, SOHO, or small to medium businesses (SMBs). The decision to use a 
single access point depends on several factors, among them the size of the location, how the 
wireless network is used, and how many wireless devices will be connected.
Just as in an IBSS conﬁ guration, several parameters need to be conﬁ gured for a BSS. These 
include the SSID or name of the network, the radio frequency channel to be used, and any 
security parameters that are set on the BSS. The access point will broadcast these and other 
parameters about the wireless network to devices that want to connect to the BSS, thus requir-
ing minimal conﬁ guration on the wireless client side. Unlike the independent basic service set, 
in a BSS the radio frequency channel is set on the access point and not on the wireless client 
device.

262
Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
Advantages and Disadvantages of a BSS
A BSS has many beneﬁ ts, advantages, and disadvantages. Some of the advantages are as 
follows:


Uses intelligent devices with a large feature set to provide users with consistent, 
reliable, and secure communications to a wireless network.


Useful in a variety of situations: homes, SOHO, and small to large businesses.


Very scalable; you can increase the coverage and capacity of a BSS by adding more 
access points.


Centralized administration and control.


Security parameters and specific access can be set centrally.
Some of the disadvantages of a BSS are as follows:


Incurs additional hardware costs compared to IBSS.


Usually will require a site survey to determine radio frequency coverage and capacity 
requirements.


Must be connected to a network infrastructure known as the distribution system, 
either wired or wireless.


Additional knowledge required for configuration and deployment.

The Extended Service Set
As stated in the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard, an extended service set (ESS) is deﬁ ned 
as a “set of one or more interconnected basic service sets (BSSs) that appears as a single 
BSS to the logical link control (LLC) layer at any station (STA) associated with one of 
those BSSs.” In basic terms, this can be one or more access points connected to a com-
mon wired or wireless distribution system. An ESS is a common conﬁ guration in most 
wireless LAN deployments for small to medium businesses as well as large enterprise 
organizations. 
In most cases, an ESS would be used to provide consistent and complete coverage across 
an entire organization. An ESS can be thought of as several basic service sets (BSSs) that 
must have matching parameters, such as SSID and security settings. If the SSIDs of two 
access points do not match, then they are considered separate basic service sets, even 
though they are connected by a common network infrastructure. It is the distribution sys-
tem connecting these together and a common network name (SSID) that makes up the ESS. 
In most cases, the basic service area for each BSS will overlap to allow roaming (transition) 
from one BSS to another. Figure 8.7 shows an example of an extended service set (ESS).

Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
Roaming between access points is a critical component of wireless LAN technology in 
most modern wireless network deployments. This is because the wireless LAN is now a 
major part of every corporate network. Many envision a complete wireless network for all 
communications, including data, voice, and video. Roaming is so important that the IEEE 
added the 802.11r amendment to provide a standardized methodology for client station 
roaming and fast secure transition within the wireless LAN.
The Basic Service Area
The basic service area (BSA) is the area of radio frequency coverage or the RF cell that 
encompasses a wireless access point and its associated stations. A wireless client device 
will be contained in the basic service area as long as it has enough required receive signal 
strength to maintain an association state with the wireless access point.
Know Your Abbreviations: SSID vs. ESSID vs. BSSID
It is easy to confuse the abbreviations (acronyms) for several of the wireless LAN 
terms we have learned. This sidebar will summarize the differences.
SSID (Service Set Identiﬁ er)
SSID (service set identiﬁ er) is the network name and provides some segmentation 
of the wireless network.
ESSID (Extended Service Set Identiﬁ er)
Although not deﬁ ned by the IEEE 802.11 standard or amendments, extended service set 
identiﬁ er (ESSID) is a term that some manufacturers use in place of SSID. For the most 
part, ESSID and SSID are synonymous terms for the name or segmentation of a wireless 
network. The term used will vary among manufacturers. The term ESSID was adopted 
by some manufacturers because it implies more than one access point is using the same 
SSID and security settings connected to a common distribution system.
BSSID (Basic Service Set Identiﬁ er)
It is sometimes easy to confuse the basic service set identiﬁ er (BSSID) with the SSID or 
name of the network. The BSSID is deﬁ ned as the unique identiﬁ er, Media Access Control 
(MAC) address of the basic service set. It is important to note that some manufactur-
ers may allow for several BSSIDs to be connected to a single access point radio or for a 
single common BSSID to be shared among many access points.
To review, the MAC address is the unique identiﬁ er of a network adapter or what is known 
as the hardware address. The radio in an access point is also a network adapter. The dif-
ference between a wired and a wireless network adapter is simply that no Ethernet jack is 
available on a wireless adapter. Instead, a radio is used for Layer 1 communications.

265
The MAC address is a 48-bit IEEE 802 format address that uniquely identiﬁ es the network 
interface adapter—or, in this case, radio. The format of the BSSID is XX:XX:XX:YY:YY:YY
where X is the number assigned to a manufacturer and Y is the unique hardware address 
of the device.
Although the BSSID uniquely identiﬁ es the access point’s radio using a MAC address, the 
SSID is broadcast as the name of the network in order to allow devices to connect. Some 
devices allow for multiple SSIDs, which use multiple BSSIDs for a single radio. This lets a 
single access point connected to a wired infrastructure provide multiple WLANs.
In an ad hoc or IBSS network there is no access point for centralized communica-
tion. Instead, wireless LAN devices communicate directly with each other. Because 
there is no access point in this conﬁ guration, the BSSID is a randomly generated 
number that has the same format as the 802 MAC address and is generated by the 
ﬁ rst ad hoc wireless device at startup.
Connecting to an IEEE 802.11 Wireless 
Network
In order for a device to successfully connect to a wireless network, several different frame 
exchanges must take place. Various frame types allow for speciﬁ c functions to occur. They 
include the authentication and association process, reserving the medium, exchanging data, 
and power save functions. The following section introduces some of the frame types and 
the roles they play in wireless networking.
IEEE 802.11 Frame Types
As discussed in Chapter 6, “Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN 
Technology,” devices communicate by sending radio frequency waves to each other through 
the air. These RF waves carry the digital data from one device to another. At this stage, the 
information traveling through the air is organized into what are known as frames. These 
frame types play various roles depending on the information being sent. Wireless LANs use 
three different frame types.
Management Frames
Management frames are used to manage the network. Management frames assist wireless 
LAN devices in ﬁ nding and connecting to a wireless network. This includes advertising the 
capabilities of the WLAN and allowing connections by the authentication and association 
process. Management frames are exchanged only between immediate wireless devices such 

266
Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
as an access point and client device and never cross the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI 
model. It is important to understand that management frames are always transmitted at 
the lowest mandatory data rate of the service set so that all stations on the same radio fre-
quency channel in the basic service area can understand them. The following are examples 
of management frames:

Control Frames
Control frames are used to control access to the wireless medium by allowing devices to 
reserve the medium and acknowledge data. In addition, some control frames are used to 
request data from the access point after returning from a power save state and with IEEE 
802.11 protection mechanisms to allow wireless device coexistence. Some examples of con-
trol frames are as follows:


RTS


CTS


CTS to Self


PS-Poll


Data Frames
As their name implies, data frames are used to carry data payload or Layer 3 information 
between wireless devices.
A special type of data frame is the null data or null function frame, which helps imple-
ment power save features and is not used to carry any data payload. There is also a variant 
of the null frame called the QoS null frame, which is used with quality of service functions. 
Examples of data frames include:

The details of the speciﬁ c functions of each of these frame types are beyond the scope 
of this book and the CWTS exam objectives, but some of these frames needed to be brieﬂ y 
introduced in order to explain upcoming topics. These include a wireless device “listening” 
for a network to join, supplying the appropriate credentials, and ﬁ nally connecting to send 
data to the network infrastructure.
Wireless Network Discovery
Wireless network discovery is the process of a client device looking for wireless networks 
and identifying the parameters of the network, including the SSID, supported data rates, and 
security settings. The discovery phase consists of the passive scanning and active scanning pro-
cesses. Wireless network discovery prepares a wireless client device to perform an IEEE 802.11 
authenticat ion and association, which will allow a device access to the wireless network.
Passive Scanning
The ﬁ rst part of the discovery phase in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking is known as pas-
sive scanning. This process allows wireless LAN devices to “listen” for information about 
wireless networks in the radio receiving area of the wireless network or the basic service 
area (BSA). During the passive scanning process, wireless LAN devices will listen for spe-
ciﬁ c information to make them aware of networks in the area. An analogy to this process 
would be using an FM radio tuner to scan through the entire band listening for a station 
to tune in to. The radio will scan through the band listening for different stations. Once a 
desired station is heard, the person listening can stop on that speciﬁ c radio station.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, management frames assist wireless LAN devices 
in ﬁ nding and connecting to a wireless network. An example of a management frame that 
works in the discovery phase or passive scanning is a beacon frame. This frame for the 
most part is an advertisement of the wireless network. It carries speciﬁ c information about 
the access point or basic service set such as the SSID, the radio frequency channel that it is 
operating on, the available data rates it is conﬁ gured for, the security parameters, and much 
more. During the passive scanning phase, wireless devices listen for beacons advertising the 
details about the wireless networks in the area or radio range of the client device. Wireless 
LAN devices are constantly listening for beacon frames. Figure 8.8 shows a wireless LAN 
client passively scanning and listening for an access point to connect with.
By default, beacons broadcast at about 10 times a second. This value is actually 1024 
microseconds and is identiﬁ ed as the target beacon transmission time (TBTT). Although 
this interval can be changed, it is recommended to do so only if necessary or recommended 
by the manufacturer. In some cases, manufacturers may suggest speciﬁ c timing intervals for 
such frames as beacons.

Active Scanning
Active scanning is the second part of the wireless LAN discovery phase. In active scan-
ning, wireless LAN devices wishing to connect to a network send out a management frame 
known as a probe request. The function of this management frame is to ﬁ nd a speciﬁ c wire-
less access point to connect with. Depending on the wireless client utility software used, if 
an SSID is speciﬁ ed in the client utility software active proﬁ le, the device will join only a 
network with the matching SSID that is speciﬁ ed. An exception to this is a probe request 
that contains a “wildcard SSID” or a “null SSID.” The IEEE 802.11 standard requires all 

Connecting to an IEEE 802.11 Wireless Network

access points to respond to a “null” or broadcast probe request. This type of probe request 
frame will not specify an SSID value and will rely on the access points to provide the SSID 
in the probe response frame. The probe request and probe response frames are discussed in 
more detail later in this chapter.
Access points constantly listen for probe request frames. Any access point within hear-
ing range of the wireless device and having a matching SSID sends out a probe response 
frame to the wireless device. If more than one access point responds, the device selects the 
“best” access point to connect with based on certain factors such as signal strength and 
signal quality. Figure 8.10 illustrates the active scanning process.

Frames Used for Active Scanning
During the active scanning process, two frames are exchanged between the device 
and the access point.
1. The wireless LAN device sends a broadcast probe request frame to all devices, 
including access points within radio range.
2. The access point(s) send a probe response frame to the device so it can iden-
tify the parameters of the network before joining.

Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
Figure 8.11 shows a packet analyzer capturing frames of the active scanning process.
F I G U R E  8 .11   Packet analyzer capture of probe request and probe response frames
The IEEE 802.11 standard requires access points to respond to devices that 
are sending a null or blank SSID. The standard refers to this as a wildcard 
SSID. It is important not to confuse this with disabling the SSID broad-
cast on an access point. Most wireless equipment manufacturers provide 
the capability to set the access point not to respond to a probe request 
with a null or wildcard SSID. If the AP is set not to respond to such probe 
requests, the wireless device is required to have the SSID specified in the 
client utility in order to connect to the BSS.
IEEE 802.11 Authentication
Authentication in general is deﬁ ned as verifying or conﬁ rming an identity. We use a vari-
ety of authentication mechanisms in our daily lives, such as logging onto a computer or 
network at home or at the ofﬁ ce, accessing secure sites on the Internet, using an ATM 
machine, or showing an identiﬁ cation badge to get access to a building.
IEEE 802.11 devices must use an authentication process in order to access network 
resources. This IEEE 802.11 authentication process differs from conventional authentica-
tion methods such as providing credentials, a username and password to gain access to a 
network. The authentication discussed here is wireless device or IEEE 802.11 authentica-
tion, required in order for the device to become part of the wireless network and participate 
in exchanging data frames. (Providing credentials such as a username and password or a 
preshared key is a different type of authentication, to be discussed in Chapter 9.) The IEEE 
802.11 standard addresses two types of IEEE authentication methods: open system and 
shared key.
IEEE 802.11 Open System Authentication
This 802.11 authentication method is deﬁ ned by the IEEE 802.11 standard as a null authen-
tication algorithm and is a two-step authentication process. Two management frames are 
exchanged between the device and the access point during open systems authentication. For 
the most part, open system authentication cannot fail unless other security measures such 
as MAC ﬁ ltering are put in place that will prevent the device from accessing the network. 
Keep in mind that IEEE 802.11 open system authentication always exists, even with the 
most secure wireless LANs. It is used to allow the wireless station to connect to the access 
point and then after association use additional credentials such as a passphrase or username 

Connecting to an IEEE 802.11 Wireless Network 
271
and password pair for authentication. If the wireless station did not perform an open system 
authentication and association ﬁ rst, there would be no way to use additional security mecha-
nisms. IEEE 802.11 open system authentication is the only valid authentication process 
allowed with newer wireless LAN security amendments and interoperability certiﬁ cations 
for the network to be considered a robust security network (RSN).
Open system authentication is a very simple process. A wireless LAN device will ask an 
access point, “Can I be a part of this network?” and the access point will respond, “Sure, 
come join the party.” So there really is no validation of identity. Open system authentication 
is considered a two-way frame exchange because two authentication frames are sent during 
this process. It is not a request and response situation; it is authentication and success. 
Figure 8.12 illustrates open system authentication.

Open system authentication does not provide any type of data 
encryption. With open system authentication, Wired Equivalent Privacy 
(WEP) is optional and can be used for data encryption if desired. WEP 
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
These are the two steps used for open system authentication. One management frame is 
sent in each step.
1. 
The wireless LAN device wanting to authenticate sends an authentication frame to the 
access point. This frame is acknowledged by the access point.
2. 
The access point accepting the authentication sends a successful authentication frame 
back to the device. This frame is acknowledged by the authenticating device.

exchange.

IEEE 802.11 Shared-Key Authentication
Shared-key is another authentication method deﬁ ned by the IEEE 802.11 standard. It is 
a little more complex than open system authentication. This IEEE 802.11 authentication 
method is a four-way frame exchange. During shared-key authentication, four manage-
ment frames are sent between the wireless device wanting to join the wireless network and 
the access point. Shared-key authentication differs from open system authentication in that 
shared-key authentication is used for both IEEE 802.11 authentication and data encryption.
Shared-key authentication is considered ﬂ awed because the authentication key and 
therefore the encryption (WEP key) used could be captured by an intruder. If an intruder 
were to capture the four wireless frames used during the shared-key authentication process, 
they would be able to use this information with the appropriate software and extract the 
security (WEP) key. Shared-key authentication requires the use of Wired Equivalent Privacy 
(WEP) for both wireless device authentication and data encryption. Because WEP is man-
datory with shared-key authentication, an intruder could potentially identify the WEP key 
used for the network by capturing the authentication process using a wireless packet ana-
lyzer. Shared-key authentication therefore should be avoided whenever possible and is not 
allowed when using newer IEEE 802.11i, WPA, or WPA2 security methods.
Some manufacturers have removed the option to set shared-key 
authentication, both in infrastructure devices such as access points 
and bridges and in client software utilities. Some legacy devices may 
still use shared-key authentication as the only authentication option. 
If this is the case, steps need to be taken to protect the integrity of 
the network and also to identify an appropriate upgrade path for the 
devices using IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication.
Figure 8.14 illustrates the four frames exchanged during the shared-key authentication 
process.
As mentioned earlier, because WEP is mandatory with shared-key authentication, it 
makes a system vulnerable to intrusion. Therefore, open system authentication is consid-
ered more secure than shared-key authentication when WEP is used with open system 
authentication. This is because WEP is used to encrypt the data only and not used for

the IEEE 802.11 authentication process. WEP was designed as a way to protect wireless 
networking users from casual eavesdropping.

Frames Used for Shared-Key Authentication
An 802.11 wireless device must perform an IEEE 802.11 authentication to the wire-
less network prior to associating according to the 802.11 standard. The following 
steps show the four-way frame exchange used for shared-key authentication. This 
method should not be used but is shown here to illustrate the process.
1. The wireless LAN device wanting to authenticate sends an authentication frame 
to the access point. This frame is acknowledged by the access point.
2. The access point sends a frame back to the WLAN device that contains a chal-
lenge text. This frame is acknowledged by the WLAN device.
3. The WLAN device sends a frame back to the access point containing an 
encrypted response to the challenge text. The response is encrypted using the 
device’s WEP key. This frame is acknowledged by the access point.
4. After verifying the encrypted response the access point accepts the authentication 
and sends a “successful authentication” frame back to the device. This ﬁ nal frame is 
acknowledged by the device.
Figure 8.15 shows the four authentication frames used in shared-key authentication.

IEEE 802.11 association takes place after a wireless device has been successfully 802.11 
authenticated either by open system authentication or by shared-key authentication. In the 
association state, the authenticated device can pass trafﬁ c across the access point to the net-
work infrastructure or other associated wireless devices, allowing access to resources that 
the device or user has permissions to access. After a device is authenticated and associated, 
it is considered to be part of the basic service set. A device must be 802.11 authenticated 
before it can be associated. Figure 8.16 illustrates the association process, and Figure 8.17 
shows frames used during the association process.

After successful association, the IEEE 802.11 authentication and association process 
is complete. Keep in mind that this is very basic access to the network using either open 
system authentication or WEP for authentication and encryption. After this process is com-
plete, more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as IEEE 802.1X/EAP (which 
provides user-based authentication) or preshared key (passphrase) can be used to secure the 
wireless network. These and other security components will be discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 9.
Frames Used for IEEE 802.11 Association
After a successful 802.11 authentication, the association process will begin. Asso-
ciation allows a wireless device to send information across the access point to the 
network infrastructure.
1. Wireless LAN device sends an association request frame to the access point. 
This frame is acknowledged by the access point.
2. The access point sends an association response frame to the device. This frame 
is acknowledged by the associating device.
IEEE 802.11 Deauthentication and Disassociation
It is worthwhile to understand that the opposite of authentication and association can 
occur in a wireless LAN. These events are known as deauthentication and disassociation.
Deauthentication occurs when an existing authentication is no longer valid. This can be 
caused by a wireless LAN device logging off from the current connection or roaming to a 
different BSS. A disassociation occurs when an association to an access point is terminated. 
This may occur when the associated wireless LAN device roams from one BSS to another. 
Both deauthentication and disassociation are notiﬁ cations and not requests. Since neither 
can be refused by either side, they are both considered automatically successful from the 
sender’s perspective. Unless IEEE 802.11w is implemented, deauthentication can also be a 
security issue. These frames can be used for denial of service attacks or to hijack a wire-
less device. Both deauthentication and disassociation frames are management frames. 
Figure 8.18 shows how disassociation and deauthentication frames would look on a packet 
analyzer.
F I G U R E  8 .18   Packet capture of disassociation and deauthentication frames

276 
Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
Intrusion tools are available that will continuously send deauthentication 
frames to a device. Use of this type of tool is considered a denial-of-service 
(DoS) attack. An intruder may also use a deauthentication frame to force 
a device to reauthenticate to an access point causing the device to be 
hijacked. This as well as other possible intrusion techniques will be dis-
cussed in Chapter 9. The 802.11w amendment provides enhancements to 
the IEEE 802.11 standard that enables data integrity, data origin authenticity, 
replay protection, and data confidentiality for selected IEEE 802.11 manage-
ment frames including authentication.
The Distribution System 
In wireless LAN technology, the distribution system (DS) is the common network infra-
structure to which wireless access points are connected; it can be wired or wireless. In most 
cases this would be an Ethernet segment. In this capacity, the access point acts like a Layer 
2 translational bridge. A translational bridge is deﬁ ned as a device used to connect two or 
more dissimilar types of LANs together, such as wireless (IEEE 802.11) and Ethernet (IEEE 
802.3). From a receiver’s perspective, this allows an access point to take information from 
the air (the communication medium in wireless networking) and make a decision either to 
send it back out to the same wireless radio or to forward it across to the distribution sys-
tem. An access point can do this because it has enough intelligence to determine if a data 
frame is destined to be sent to the distribution system or if it should stay on the originat-
ing wireless side of the network. This is possible because the access point knows whether a 
device is part of the wireless LAN side through the authentication and association methods 
mentioned earlier. Figure 8.19 shows an example of a distribution system.

Data Rates

The distribution system is a network segment that consists of one or more connected 
basic service sets. As mentioned earlier, according to the original IEEE 802.11 standard, 
one or more interconnected basic service sets make up an extended service set. The dis-
tribution system allows wireless LAN devices to communicate with resources on a wired 
network infrastructure or to communicate with each other through the wireless medium. 
Either way, all wireless frame transmissions will traverse through an access point.
In some cases it may be feasible and justiﬁ ed to use a wireless distribution system 
(WDS). Unlike the wired distribution system mentioned earlier, a wireless distribution sys-
tem will connect basic service sets together using wireless LAN technology. Typically the 
best way to use a WDS is to use two different radio technologies in the same access points. 
For example, using the 2.4 GHz band for wireless device access and the 5 GHz band for 
the distribution system will limit contention and provide associated devices a better experi-
ence because one radio is used for device access and the other creates the WDS. Figure 8.20 
shows an example of a wireless distribution system.

Data Rates
The speed at which wireless devices are designed to exchange information is known as 
the data rate. As mentioned in Chapter 5, “Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread-
Spectrum Technology,” these rates will differ depending on the wireless standard, amend-
ment, spread spectrum type, or Physical Layer technology in use. Table 8.1 shows data 
rates for various WLAN technologies. Data rates do not accurately represent the amount

of information that is actually being transferred between devices and a wireless network. 
Figure 8.21 shows an 802.11a/g/n wireless LAN adapter in a notebook computer reading a

Throughput
279
Throughput
Unlike data rate (the maximum amount of information theoretically capable of being sent), 
throughput is the amount of information actually being correctly received or transmitted. 
Many variables affect the throughput of information being sent. Some of these include:


Spread spectrum or Physical Layer technology type in use


Radio frequency interference


Number of wireless devices connected to an access point
For example, an 802.11g wireless access point has a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps. 
With one user connected to this access point, chances are the best throughput that could be 
expected is less than 50 percent of the maximum, or about 20 Mbps. If more users connect 
to the same access point, the throughput for each user would be even less, because of the 
contention between users sharing the same wireless medium. Figure 8.22 shows an example 
of actual throughput for an 802.11a/g/n wireless LAN adapter.

Packing and Shipping Data: A Throughput Analogy
Packing and shipping an item in a cardboard box is a way of looking at data rate 
versus throughput. You have a cardboard box that is rated to have a maximum 
capacity of two cubic feet. You want to send a fragile item such as a vase to 
somebody else. The vase if measured would really only take about one cubic foot 
of space. However, this is a very fragile item, and you want to make sure it gets 
to the destination without any damage. So rather than just put the vase by itself in 
a box with a capacity of one cubic foot, you want to protect it with some packing 
material such as bubble wrap. Wrapping the vase in bubble wrap will take an addi-
tional one cubic foot of space.
The data rate is analogous to the box capable of holding two cubic feet of mate-
rial. The one-cubic-foot vase is analogous to the actual data being sent. The pack-
ing material is analogous to the contention management and other overhead that 
causes the throughput to be less than the theoretical capacity of the WLAN device.
In Exercise 8.1 you will measure the throughput of your own wireless network.

Measuring Throughput of a Wireless Network
In this activity, you will measure throughput of a wireless network. If you have the proper 
equipment, it is not too difﬁ cult. If you already have an existing wireless network set up

Dynamic Rate Switching
When a wireless device moves through the basic service area (BSA) or as the distance from 
the access point increases, the data rate will decrease. Conversely, as the wireless device 
moves closer to the access point, the data rate can increase. This is called dynamic rate 
switching (DRS), also known as dynamic rate shifting and even dynamic rate selection. This 
process allows an associated wireless device to adapt to the radio frequency in a particular 
location of the BSA. DRS is typically accomplished through proprietary mechanisms set 
by the manufacturer of the wireless device. The main goal of dynamic rate switching is to 
improve performance for the wireless device connected to an access point. As a wireless 
device moves away from an access point, the amount of received signal will decrease because 
of the free space path loss. When this occurs, the modulation type will change because the 
radio frequency signal quality is less and thus a lower data rate will be realized.
Remember from Chapter 5 that different data rates use different modulation technolo-
gies. Using a less complex modulation type at a lower data rate will provide better overall 
performance as the station moves away from the access point. Figure 8.23 illustrates how 
dynamic rate switching works. As the wireless device moves away from the access point,

the data rate will decrease. Keep in mind the opposite is true as well. As a wireless device 
moves closer to an access point, the data rate will increase.

Wireless LAN Roaming or Transition
In wireless LAN technology, roaming is the term for what happens when a wireless device 
moves from one basic service set or access point to another. Roaming was not addressed in 
the original IEEE 802.11 standard. This process is typically accomplished in a proprietary 
manner based on how the manufacturer chooses to implement it. Manufacturers use dif-
ferent criteria to initiate roaming from one access point to another. There was an amend-
ment to the IEEE 802.11 standard (IEEE 802.11F, Inter-Access Point Protocol) that was 
ratiﬁ ed in June 2003 as a recommended practice intended to address multivendor access 
point interoperability. However, this recommended practice was implemented by few if any 
manufacturers, and it was withdrawn by the IEEE 802 Executive Committee in February 
2006. The next attempt to standardize roaming between access points is IEEE 802.11r. 
This driving force behind this amendment to the standard was to allow for fast secure tran-
sition with wireless voice devices. 
When a wireless LAN device moves through a BSA and receives a signal from another 
access point, it needs to make a decision whether to stay associated with the current access 
point or to reassociate with the new access point. This decision when to roam is proprietary 
and based on speciﬁ c manufacturer criteria. Some of these criteria manufacturers use are:

288 
Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology


Signal strength


Signal-to-noise ratio


Error rate


Number of currently associated devices
When a wireless LAN device chooses to reassociate to a new access point, the original 
access point will hand off the association to the new access point as requested from the 
new access point. Keep in mind it is the wireless client device that initiates the move to a new 
access point. This move is done over the wired network or distribution system based on how the 
manufacturer implemented the roaming criteria. Figure 8.24 illustrates a notebook computer 
roaming from one access point to a new access point.

Frames Used for Reassociation (Roaming)
When a device moves or “roams” to a new access point, it needs to associate to the 
new access point. Because the device is already associated, in order to connect to 
the new access point it must complete a reassociation process.
1. A wireless LAN device sends a reassociation request frame to the new access 
point. This frame is acknowledged by the new access point.
2. The new access point sends a reassociation response frame to the wireless 
device after handoff across the distribution system from the original access point 
has occurred. This frame is acknowledged by the reassociating wireless device.

The 802.11r amendment to the standard was ratified in 2008 and is 
now part of the IEEE 802.11-2012 Standard. This amendment is for fast 
BSS transition (FT) and allows for fast secure roaming for devices 
between basic service sets. The main objective of this amendment is 
to support voice over IP (VoIP) technology.
IEEE 802.11 Power Save Operations
Many wireless LAN devices are portable and use DC battery power to some degree. A 
wireless network adapter uses DC power to operate, and in some cases this could be a sig-
niﬁ cant drain on the battery in the device. This is especially true with newer IEEE 802.11n 
wireless adapters that support MIMO technology. The original IEEE 802.11 standard 
addresses power saving operation. This power save operation is designed to allow a wireless 
LAN device to enter a dozing state in order to conserve DC power and extend battery life. 
If the wireless LAN device is plugged into a consistent power source such as an AC outlet, 
there is no reason to implement power save features. However, portable devices that are 
mobile and may not have access to an AC power source should consider using power save 
operations. The original IEEE 802.11 standard addressed two different power save modes: 
active mode (AM) and power save (PS) mode. In some cases, power save (PS) mode is con-
sidered legacy because the IEEE 802.11e amendment for quality of service addresses new, 
more efﬁ cient power save mechanisms. Although the original PS mode may be considered 
legacy, it is still widely used in many devices. As mentioned earlier in this chapter in the 
section “IEEE 802.11 Frame Types,” a data frame known as a null function frame is used 
with power management and does not carry any data but is used to inform the access point 
of a change in power state.
Active Mode
In active mode (AM) a wireless LAN device or station (STA) may receive frames at any time 
and is always in an “awake” state. In this case, the wireless LAN device is not relying on 
battery power; thus, there is no reason for the device to assume a low power state, and it will 
never doze. Some manufacturers refer to active mode as continuous aware mode (CAM).

290
Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
Power Save Mode
In power save (PS) mode, the wireless LAN device or station (STA) will doze or enter a low 
power state for very short periods of times. At speciﬁ c time intervals, the device will “lis-
ten” for selected beacons and determine if any data is waiting for it (buffered) at the access 
point. The beacon frame contains information for associated devices regarding power 
save. When a wireless LAN device associates to an access point, the device receives what 
is known as an association ID (AID). The association ID is a value that will represent that 
device in various functions, including power save mode. The beacon frame contains an indi-
cator for each AID associated device to let wireless devices know whether they have data 
waiting for them or buffered at the access point. If it is determined that the access point 
does have data buffered for a speciﬁ c device, the device will send a control frame message 
(PS-Poll frame) to the access point to request the buffered data. Figure 8.26 shows where 
power save mode can be set in the advanced settings of the wireless adapter device driver.
F I G U R E  8 . 2 6   The driver settings for an Intel 5100 IEEE 802.11a/g/n wireless 
adapter and power save mode setting
Power save mode may cause some amount of overhead for the wireless LAN device, and 
there is a trade-off in performance. With power save mode enabled, the battery life will be 
extended; however, performance will suffer to some degree because the device will not be 
available to receive data continuously. The device will only be able to receive buffered data 
during the “awake” state. Power save mode is common in applications where battery conser-
vation is important, such as barcode scanners, voice over Wi-Fi phones, and other handheld 
devices. 

IEEE 802.11 Protection Mechanisms
291
Use of Power Save Mode in Barcode Scanners
Organizations such as retail, manufacturing, and warehousing have been using 802.11 
wireless LAN technologies for many years. Many of these businesses use wireless LAN 
devices such as barcode scanners in addition to notebook computers and other portable 
devices. Barcode scanners are used heavily for inventory and asset tracking purposes. 
These devices must run for many hours at a time, typically in 8- or 10-hour shifts for 
individuals who may be using them. Applications such as this greatly beneﬁ t from using 
IEEE 802.11 power save features and extending battery life of wireless LAN devices. This 
minimizes downtime because batteries in these devices will not have to be changed or 
recharged as often during a work shift.
Automatic Power Save Delivery
The IEEE 802.11e Quality of Service amendment to the standard fueled the need for more 
efﬁ cient power save mechanisms in wireless networking. Depending on the implementa-
tion and requirements, legacy power save modes may not be efﬁ cient enough to work 
with applications that use QoS, such as voice and video. Automatic power save delivery 
(APSD) differs from the original power save mode in that a trigger frame will wake a 
device in order to receive data. APSD is a more efﬁ cient way of performing power save 
functions. It works well with time-bound applications that are subject to latency, such as 
voice and video.
IEEE 802.11 Protection Mechanisms
In order to allow newer, faster wireless LAN technology such as 802.11g and 802.11n 
devices to communicate with older, slower wireless devices, technology called protection 
mechanisms was designed to allow for backward compatibility. The mechanisms available 
depend on which amendment to the standard is used. Protection mechanisms will provide 
the backward compatibility needed to allow different technologies to coexist in the same 
radio frequency space.
There are two broad categories of protection mechanism:


Extended rate physical (ERP) protection mechanism for IEEE 802.11g networks


High throughput (HT) protection mechanism for IEEE 802.11n networks
Each category includes several modes for speciﬁ c situations.

292
Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
IEEE 802.11g Extended Rate Physical Protection 
Mechanisms
In order for IEEE 802.11g and IEEE 802.11b devices to coexist in the same basic service 
area, the wireless access point must use extended rate physical (ERP) protection. Most 
manufacturers of IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN equipment will provide options when it comes 
to coexistence. These options usually include the capability to set an access point to one of 
three modes:


IEEE 802.11b only mode: DSSS and HR/DSSS


IEEE 802.11g only mode: ERP-OFDM


IEEE 802.11b/g mixed mode: DSSS, HR/DSSS, and ERP-OFDM
IEEE 802.11b-Only Mode
This mode requires setting an access point to operate in 802.11b-only mode. This involves 
disabling all the IEEE 802.11g ERP-OFDM data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 
Mbps and allowing only DSSS data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps and HR/DSSS rates of 5.5 and 
11 Mbps. Enabling this mode limits the maximum data rate to 11 Mbps. Setting an access 
point to this mode has limited applications such as using legacy IEEE 802.11b-only capable 
devices, for example.
IEEE 802.11g-Only Mode
This mode is the opposite of 802.11b-only mode. It disables all of the IEEE 802.11b DSSS 
and HR/DSSS data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps, and it allows the IEEE 802.11g ERP-
OFDM data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. This operation mode is useful 
in an environment where backward compatibility to 802.11b is not required, such as an 
environment where all devices connecting have IEEE 802.11g capability, and the through-
put needs to be maximized; thus there are no IEEE 802.11b devices in use.
IEEE 802.11b/g Mixed Mode
Most deployments in the 2.4 GHz ISM band use this mode for communications. This allows 
devices that support the IEEE 802.11g amendment and IEEE 802.11b devices to operate 
together in the same BSA and associated to the same access point. As mentioned in Chapter 2, 
“Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking,” throughput will decrease when IEEE 
802.11b devices and IEEE 802.11g devices are both associated to the same access point.
Extended Rate Physical (ERP) mixed mode uses control frames to reserve the wireless 
medium. Two options are available:
Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS)  One option of control frames that are used as 
a protection mechanism to reserve the RF medium.
Clear to Send (CTS) to Self  A single frame used as a protection mechanism. This is a com-
mon implementation used by wireless LAN equipment manufacturers. A beneﬁ t of using 
this frame is less overhead than the RTS/CTS process.

IEEE 802.11 Protection Mechanisms
293
Both RTS/CTS and CTS-to-Self control frames allow wireless devices using different 
Physical Layer technologies to share the wireless medium and help to avoid collisions. 
These control frames specify how much time is needed for a frame exchange between the 
transmitter and a receiver to complete. This time value is processed by all devices in the 
basic service area that are not part of the frame exchange. Once this time has expired, the 
wireless medium is considered clear. 
IEEE 802.11n High-Throughput Protection Mechanisms
IEEE 802.11n devices operate in either the 2.4 GHz or the 5 GHz band. Backward com-
patibility for IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices needs to be taken into consideration. The IEEE 
802.11n amendment identiﬁ es several different modes for high-throughput (HT) protection
mechanisms. These mechanisms are known as HT protection modes and are a set of rules 
that devices and access points will use for backward compatibility:


Mode 0–Greenfield mode


Mode 1–HT nonmember protection mode


Mode 2–HT 20 MHz protection mode


Mode 3–HT mixed mode
These modes are constantly changing based on the radio frequency environment and 
associated wireless devices. The goal with IEEE 802.11n wireless networks is to get to 
Mode 0–Greenﬁ eld mode. With today’s wireless networks and WLAN technology, we are 
more than likely at Mode 3–HT mixed mode or possibly even one of the other two modes 
in most cases.
Mode 0–Greenfield Mode
Mode 0 or Greenﬁ eld mode allows high-throughput (HT) devices only. These HT devices 
must also share operational functionality and they must match; for example, they must all 
support 20 MHz or 20/40 MHz channels only. If an IEEE 802.11n (HT) access point is set 
to 20/40 MHz channel width and a client capable of only 20 MHz wide channels associates, 
the connection is not considered Greenﬁ eld mode. Mode 0 does not allow IEEE 802.11a/b/g 
devices using the same RF channel. IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices will not be able to communi-
cate with an access point in Greenﬁ eld mode. Transmissions from these devices will cause 
collisions at the access point, causing some degradation in throughput because it is seen by 
the HT system as radio frequency interference. Greenﬁ eld mode is what we as wireless net-
work designers and administrators are working toward achieving, but it may be some time 
before we are there because of backward compatibility and legacy wireless devices.
Mode 1–HT Nonmember Protection Mode
All devices in Mode 1 or HT nonmember protection mode must be HT-capable. When 
a non-HT device—that is, an IEEE 802.11a/b/g access point or wireless client device—is 
within the hearing range of the HT access point and on the same 20 MHz channel or one 
of the 20/40 MHz wide channels, this protection mode will be activated.

294
Chapter 8  Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
Mode 2–HT 20 MHz Protection Mode
All devices in Mode 2 or HT 20 MHz protection mode must be HT-capable as well. The 
operation of this protection mode is based on the fact that 802.11n devices can use 20 
MHz or 20/40 MHz wide channels. Mode 2 means that at least one 20 MHz HT station is 
associated with the HT 20/40 MHz access point and that the access point provides compat-
ibility for 20 MHz devices.
Mode 3–HT Mixed Mode
Mode 3 or HT mixed mode is used if one or more non-HT stations are associated in the 
BSS. This mode allows backward compatibility with non-802.11n or IEEE 802.11a/b/g 
wireless devices. This is the likely the most common mode for IEEE 802.11n HT networks 
today because of the need for backward compatibility and the legacy IEEE 802.11 wireless 
devices that are still in use on most wireless networks.
Additional HT Protection Modes
Two other HT protection modes are also available:


Dual CTS is a Layer 2 protection mechanism that is used for backward compatibility 
between IEEE 802.11n HT and IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices.


Phased coexistence operation (PCO) is an optional BSS mode with alternating 20 MHz 
and 20/40 MHz phases controlled by a PCO-capable access point.
Summary
Wireless LANs can operate in two modes: either ad hoc mode, which means no access 
points are used, or infrastructure mode, where an access point provides a central point of 
communication for the wireless LAN devices. In this chapter, we looked at these modes of 
operation as well as the service sets IEEE 802.11 networks use. We looked at the three con-
ﬁ gurations for wireless LANs: 


Independent basic service set (IBSS)


Basic service set (BSS)


Extended service set (ESS)
In this chapter we discussed the conﬁ guration of each, along with some of the advan-
tages and disadvantages of each conﬁ guration—from an IBSS, which uses no access points, 
to a BSS or ESS, which uses one or many access points. Some of the conﬁ guration parame-
ters, such as SSID and radio frequency channel, and how they are used were also explained. 
Some of these acronyms are very close in spelling and sound similar when spoken. It is 
important to understand the differences among the following abbreviations: 


Service set identifier (SSID)


Extended service set identifier (ESSID)


Basic service set identifier (BSSID)

Summary
295


Independent basic service set (IBSS)


Basic service set (BSS)


Extended service set (ESS)


Basic service area (BSA)
For example, SSID is the name of the wireless network, and the BSSID is the unique 
identiﬁ er MAC address of the AP radio.
In addition to explaining the different conﬁ gurations and terminology used, we looked 
at the processes wireless devices use to connect to and become part of a wireless LAN, 
including:


Wireless discovery


Passive scanning


Active scanning


IEEE 802.11 authentication


IEEE 802.11 association
The discovery processes of passive scanning (listening for beacons) and active scanning 
(joining a wireless LAN) are important parts of starting the connection process. This con-
tinues with 802.11 authentication—in most cases open system—and the 802.11 association 
process. Once these processes are complete, the device ﬁ nally becomes part of the wireless 
network, enabling it to pass trafﬁ c across to the access point to the network infrastructure.
We also saw the components and technology that play a role with IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networks, such as:


Distribution system (DS)


Wireless distribution system (WDS)


Data rate (what is advertised)


Throughput (what is actual)
Both a wired distribution system, in most cases Ethernet, and a wireless distribution 
system using radios and access points provide connectivity for wireless infrastructure. 
We looked at the differences between data rate and throughput. It is important to under-
stand that an access point may have a data rate of 54 Mbps or even up to 600 Mbps, but 
throughput (the actual data transmission rate) is typically less than half of the data rate. 
Because wireless LANs are contention based, data throughput will be even less when more 
devices connect to the network.
Dynamic rate switching—a client transferring more or less data depending on the prox-
imity from an access point as well as roaming or moving through the basic service areas 
and being able to maintain connectivity—was also discussed in this chapter. Finally, the 
chapter covered the important topics of power save mode and protection mechanisms. With 
power save mode, a wireless LAN device is able to extend battery life by entering into a 
low-power state or “doze” for very short periods of time. This permits the device to con-
sume less battery power, therefore allowing connectivity for longer periods of time without 
changing or recharging the battery. The modes discussed were:



Automatic power save delivery (APSD)
It is beneﬁ cial to understand the differences in power save capabilities among these 
modes.
Lastly, we discussed IEEE 802.11 protection mechanisms and the importance of these 
methods in order to provide backward compatibility and coexistence to older technology 
devices:


Extended rate physical (ERP) protection for IEEE 802.11g


High throughput (HT) protection for IEEE 802.11n
We looked at some highlights of both protection mechanism technologies for IEEE 
802.11g and 802.11n networks.

Security in many ways means deﬁ ning your level of accept-
able risk and protecting yourself to at least that level. This 
can vary greatly based on industry, budget, and the types 
and ages of devices supported. Security is a very important part of wireless networking, 
just as it is in any other type of computer networking or information technology. When 
the IEEE 802.11 standard was ﬁ rst ratiﬁ ed back in 1997, it addressed a basic security 
concept called Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). However, this security solution was con-
sidered weak and was easily compromised early on. In this chapter, we will look at some 
of the legacy wireless LAN security technologies used with standards-based wireless net-
working, including:
 Service set identifier (SSID) hiding
 Media access control (MAC) filtering
 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
We will also take a look at some of the vulnerabilities of these legacy technologies and 
see why they should not be used for securing a wireless LAN. You will learn about some 
of the newer security methods available based on the IEEE 802.11i amendment and now 
included in the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard. These security methods are also part of the 
Wi-Fi Alliance certiﬁ cations, WPA and WPA 2.0. We will explore small ofﬁ ce/home ofﬁ ce 
(SOHO) security solutions and enterprise-level security solutions. These include:
 Preshared key
 Passphrase
 User-based authentication
 IEEE 802.1X/EAP
 Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
 Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)
In Chapter 2, “Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking,” we discussed some of 
the certiﬁ cations available from the Wi-Fi Alliance that pertain to wireless LAN security. 
This chapter will explore further some of the concepts of passphrase, preshared key, and 
802.1X/EAP. We will also discuss encryption methods such as TKIP and CCMP, which are 
ways to scramble computer data and are used with wireless LANs. 
One thing that is often overlooked is security from a remote location, such as a wireless 
hotspot. In this chapter, you will learn about virtual private networking (VPN) solutions

and how they can be used to secure wireless connections for users connecting to the cor-
porate network from a remote wireless network. Wireless intrusion prevention systems 
(WIPS) are also becoming popular in today’s wireless LAN world. If WIPS is implemented 
correctly, these solutions can provide a wealth of information as well as protection for your 
network infrastructure and wireless devices. Finally, we will look at basic functions and 
implementation best practices for role-based access control (RBAC), captive portals, and 
network management and monitoring systems.
Introducing IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN 
Security
The importance of computer network security is often underestimated, and wireless LAN 
security is no different. “I don’t understand why I need to secure my access point.” “I 
don’t have anything on my computer that would be of interest to anybody other than me.” 
“I tried to enable security on my wireless, but I couldn’t get it to work so I just turned it 
off.” These are some of the common excuses many technical support engineers or consul-
tants used to hear from people when it came to wireless security. In the early days of IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking, security was weak. This led to much vulnerability, which in 
turn made wireless networking not a very attractive solution for many enterprise deploy-
ments, especially those concerned about security.
With the improvements in standards-based wireless LAN security, partly thanks to 
the Wi-Fi Alliance certiﬁ cations as well as the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard, 
wireless LANs have become a major part of many enterprise networks in all industries and 
businesses. Because wireless networks are inherently unbounded, it is possible to have more 
security protecting wireless communication than what is used to secure most wired LANs. 
This is the case in many wireless LAN implementations.
Wireless LAN Threats and Intrusion
Computer networks have always been the target of various types of intrusion techniques. 
Wireless networks are no different—in fact, wireless networks are more vulnerable to 
intrusion because the communication is not bounded by any physical media such as an 
Ethernet cable. This key vulnerability in wireless networking is the use of the air, a shared 
unbounded medium. The level of security applied to a wireless network will depend on a 
couple of factors:


What are you trying to protect?


What are you trying to prevent?

304
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
There are many security concerns related to wireless networking. Some of these concerns 
arise because wireless LANs use radio frequency for communication and the open air as the 
medium. Others are a threat to either wired or wireless networks. The following list identi-
ﬁ es some of these concerns and threats:


Eavesdropping

rity solutions such as wireless intrusion prevention systems (WIPS) are available to help 
discover and mitigate some of them. Figure 9.1 illustrates some of the vulnerabilities with 
wireless networking.

Locking the Door of Your Automobile
Let’s take a quick look at an analogy that may make network security easier to under-
stand. You need to run some errands on a Saturday afternoon and decide to go to the 
market to pick up some supplies. When you arrive at your destination, you leave your 
automobile but do not lock the door. Who could potentially enter your vehicle? The 
answer is anybody who attempts to open the door. Locking the door of your vehicle will 
prevent the casual intruder from being able to enter through the door. Therefore the lock 
on your door is one layer of security that could be used to prevent a potential intruder 
from entering your vehicle.
So, with the door locked, now who could potentially get into your vehicle? The answer 
is two different individuals: ﬁ rst, you (because you have the key to the door); second, a 
potential intruder who could compromise the lock on the door. As you can see, locking 
the door provides a layer of security and will prevent the casual intruder from entering 
your vehicle, but it will not prevent a determined intruder.
Now let’s add a second layer of security. In addition to locking the door you set an alarm 
on your vehicle. You now have two layers of security: the door lock and the alarm. For 
an intruder to gain access to your vehicle, they would now need to have the knowledge 
and the ability to overcome two layers of security. First, they would need the ability to 
compromise the lock on the door, and then they would need the knowledge to disable the 
alarm, both without being noticed. The number of potential intruders has decreased sig-
niﬁ cantly, from those who can just open the unlocked door, to those who have the knowl-
edge to not only compromise the door lock but also disable the alarm.
IEEE 802.11 Standard Security
Even though wireless LAN security has greatly increased over the years, it is important to 
understand the original IEEE 802.11 standard as it relates to wireless LAN security. It is 
important to be aware of some of the basics or building blocks prior to getting into more 
sophisticated areas of security. From a security viewpoint, the original standard addressed 
two areas of security: authentication and data privacy. Both of these are common compo-
nents of computer network security. In computer networking, authentication is deﬁ ned as 
a way of conﬁ rming an identity; basically, it determines that you are who you say you are. 
Data privacy is ensuring that information or data is understandable only by the individuals 
or groups it is intended for, the sender and the intended receiver.
One way many people may think of authentication is to supply a username and pass-
word in order to log onto a computer. Another would be to supply the appropriate logon 
before performing an activity like Internet banking. To review from Chapter 8, “Wireless 
LAN Terminology and Technology,” the original IEEE 802.11 standard addresses two 

306
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
types of authentication: open system authentication and shared-key authentication. These 
authentication types are different from the examples described earlier, which most people 
are familiar with. IEEE 802.11 authentication is performed by the wireless LAN protocol 
and, except for shared-key authentication, does not require user intervention.
IEEE 802.11 Open System Authentication
To review from Chapter 8, this type of authentication is a two-step process, a  two-frame 
exchange, and is one of the simplest ways to provide an authentication process. IEEE 802.11 
open system authentication cannot fail except for circumstances such as a network adapter 
having a bad device driver. This authentication is what is known as a null authentication,
which for the most part means it doesn’t really authenticate anything at all. For example, if a 
wireless client device such as a notebook computer wants to join the wireless network, it will 
“ask” the access point if it can authenticate, and the access point will always accept.
IEEE 802.11 Shared-Key Authentication
Also discussed in Chapter 8, IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication is a four-step process, 
not to be confused with WPA or WPA2 personal mode, which uses a preshared key for 
authentication. The main difference between open system and shared-key authentication is 
that with shared-key authentication, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is required in order for 
it to function correctly. This is because shared-key authentication uses WEP for both 802.11 
authentication and for data payload encryption. But WEP is not secure, so it makes shared-
key authentication weak and vulnerable to intrusion. WEP was intended only to protect 
wireless network users against casual eavesdropping and for authentication with shared key. 
Figure 9.2 shows how to set either open system or shared-key authentication on an enterprise-
grade access point.

Early Wireless LAN Security 
Technologies
Because of the way security was deﬁ ned in the original IEEE 802.11 standard, manufac-
turers of wireless LAN equipment were able to design different ways a user could secure a 
wireless LAN. But even though these methods looked good on paper, they did not do much 
to provide a good security solution. Some of these common wireless LAN security methods 
and legacy security solutions discussed here are:


Service set identifier (SSID) hiding (closed network)


Media access control (MAC) filtering


Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
If some of these are considered legacy wireless LAN security methods, why is it 
important to discuss them? You need to understand these solutions because there are still 
some wireless network implementations that may use some or all of them as part of a wire-
less security solution. Because standards-based wireless LAN technology has been around 
for over a decade, many early adopters had no choice but to use these security techniques. 
Over the years, wireless LAN security has improved tremendously; however, it is a fact 
that some of these early adopters still have legacy wireless devices that will not support the 
latest and greatest security technology such as WPA or WPA2. Therefore these solutions 
may still currently play a role in the wireless network infrastructure.
The Service Set Identifier
As you’ll recall from Chapter 8, the service set identiﬁ er (SSID) is a logical name for the 
wireless network and was designed to be used for wireless device segmentation. The 
SSID will allow wireless devices such as notebook computers to identify and connect to a 
wireless LAN using the discovery phase, which includes the passive and active scanning 
processes. There are a couple of ways this connection can be accomplished. Passive scan-
ning occurs when the wireless client device listens for beacons frames. The SSID is speciﬁ ed 
in a beacon frame in the SSID information element. As discussed in Chapter 8, the beacon 
frame is an advertisement of the wireless network. The beacon frame by default is set to 
broadcast at about 10 times a second. The beacon frame will advertise the SSID of the 
wireless network during this interval.
You can specify that the SSID of the wireless LAN be joined in the wireless client 
software utility of the connecting wireless device. In this case, a wireless client will send a 
probe request frame with the intent of joining that particular network. The IEEE 802.11 
standard requires access points to respond to all probe requests that have a matching 
SSID or what is known as a wildcard SSID (an SSID with a value of 0), also referred to 
as a null SSID. A wildcard SSID is used when a client device does not specify the SSID in 
the  wireless client software utility. If a wireless client device is scanning or looking for a 

308
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
wireless network to join, they will see the wireless network because the beacon frame is 
broadcasting the SSID. Most manufacturers of SOHO and enterprise access points pro-
vide the option not to broadcast the SSID in beacon frames. This is commonly known as 
disabling the SSID broadcast, SSID hiding, or a closed network and is discussed in the 
next section.
SSID Hiding
Most manufacturers of IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN equipment provide the capability to 
disable SSID broadcasting, as shown in Figure 9.3. Another term for this process is SSID hid-
ing. SSID hiding allows a user to remove the SSID that would normally appear in broadcast 
beacon frames. If the SSID is not being broadcast, the wireless network may not be seen by 
the wireless client devices that do not have that wireless network’s SSID speciﬁ ed in their 
client software utility. If somebody knows the SSID, they would be able to enter it into 
their wireless client device software and then be able to connect to the wireless network.

broadcast.

Early Wireless LAN Security Technologies
309
In the early days of wireless networking, people would hide the SSID, believing that 
would secure the network because it was not visible to devices passively scanning for a 
network to join. This was a misconception, because even though the SSID is not being 
broadcast in these beacon frames, it can still be identiﬁ ed in other wireless frames, such as 
the probe response frame. This means that anyone with a wireless scanning utility such as 
a packet analyzer would be able to determine the SSID of a wireless network by monitoring 
the frames that are sent through the air. Therefore, hiding the SSID should not be used as a 
way to secure a wireless network. 
Hiding the SSID is sometimes used to prevent the wireless network from being seen by 
those who should not be connecting to it. Many organizations will hide the SSIDs of all the 
wireless networks except for the open guest network. This is sometimes done to help reduce 
unnecessary technical support calls from someone who may try to connect to a wireless 
LAN that they do not have access to. However, this method is not intended to secure the 
wireless network.
The Media Access Control Address
To review, the media access control (MAC) address is a unique hardware identiﬁ er of a 
computer network device. This 6-byte address is the Layer 2 address that allows frames 
to be sent to and received from a device. Figure 9.4 shows the MAC address of a wireless 
network adapter viewed with ipconfig.exe. An important point here is that the MAC 
address is unique, and no two network devices should ever have the same Layer 2 MAC 
address. In a wireless network, MAC addresses are easily visible to anyone using a wireless 
packet analyzer or wireless network scanning software utility. These addresses are required 
for a network device to send and receive information; therefore, they cannot be encrypted 
and are visible to anyone with the knowledge to view them.

Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
MAC Address Filtering
Since IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN device technology operates at the lowest two layers of the 
OSI model, the Physical layer and the Data Link layer, the MAC address plays a big role in 
wireless networking. Manufacturers of wireless LAN equipment provide a feature known 
as MAC address ﬁ ltering. Its purpose is to either allow or disallow access to the wireless 
network by restricting which MAC addresses can IEEE 802.11 authenticate and associate 
to a wireless network. Figure 9.5 is an example of how to apply a MAC address ﬁ lter on an 
access point. 
F I G U R E  9. 5  Linksys WRT54G MAC filter setup
This looks great on paper but is a weak security feature, because it can be easily 
compromised. Remember, wireless networks use the air as their access medium to com-
municate, and radio frequency is what exchanges the information between devices. So if an 
intruder were to monitor the air with a tool such as a wireless packet analyzer or wireless 

IEEE 802.11 Authentication and Data Encryption
311
scanning utility software program, they would be able to see all the wireless trafﬁ c within 
hearing range of their wireless device. Because wireless LAN devices communicate with 
each other using MAC addressing, all of these addresses would be visible to whoever wants 
to see them.
MAC Address Spoofing
Because MAC addresses are visible to anyone who wants to take the time to see them 
by using the correct software utility, they create a potential problem for those who 
implemented MAC address ﬁ ltering. An intruder can easily perform a task called MAC 
address spooﬁ ng. This involves tricking the wireless device into thinking its unique MAC 
address is something other than what is encoded in the actual network card. 
There are several ways for an intruder to accomplish MAC address spooﬁ ng. It can be 
done with software programs such as SMAC or within the computer operating system—
for example, in the Microsoft Windows Registry. All options and conﬁ guration settings 
in the Windows operating system are stored in this hierarchical database known as the 
Windows Registry. If someone wanted to spoof the MAC address of a wireless network 
adapter using this database, they might (depending on the adapter) be able to enter a new 
MAC address value in the device driver’s conﬁ guration, which would then be stored in 
the Windows Registry. Another option is to change the Windows Registry value directly 
using the Registry Editor tool built into Windows. This would be considered a modiﬁ able 
MAC address. MAC addresses may also be stored in a conﬁ guration ﬁ le, and in nonvolatile 
memory. Keep in mind that changing the MAC address in the Registry or in a conﬁ gura-
tion ﬁ le changes only the software reference that the operating system sees and uses. It does 
not change what is known as the burned-in address (BIA) or the hard-coded address, which 
is unmodiﬁ able.
IEEE 802.11 Authentication and Data 
Encryption
As discussed earlier in this chapter, authentication is deﬁ ned as validating an identity. 
Authentication also gives the capability to control access to a system. In the original 
IEEE 802.11 standard, this is accomplished by using either IEEE 802.11 open system 
or shared-key authentication. Since open system authentication is a null authentica-
tion method and except for special circumstances it cannot fail, the wireless device will 
always authenticate. IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication, on the other hand, uses 
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) for wireless device authentication as well as for data 
payload encryption. Encryption is the process of modifying information from its original 
form to make it unreadable except by those who know the technique or the method in 

312 
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
which the data was modiﬁ ed. In the original IEEE 802.11 standard, data encryption was 
accomplished by using WEP. In order for a device to pass information across an access 
point, it must ﬁ rst IEEE 802.11  authenticate, and then associate.
About Wired Equivalent Privacy
From a security perspective, one major drawback to any wireless network is the fact that 
all information, including data payload, travels through the air from one device to another. 
This makes wireless LANs vulnerable to eavesdropping and inherently less secure than 
bounded networking using other networking technology such as Ethernet. With IEEE 
802.11 open system authentication, all information is broadcast through the air in plain 
text. What this means is that anyone with knowledge of how to use a wireless packet 
 analyzer or other wireless scanning software program can easily see all the information 
that is passing between devices through the air.
WEP was designed as a way to protect wireless networking from casual eavesdropping. 
The original IEEE 802.11 standard states that the use of WEP is optional. The manufac-
turer supplies the capability, but it is up to the user of the wireless device to implement it.
In wireless LANs, WEP can be used in one of two ways: with IEEE 802.11 open system 
authentication to encrypt the data only or with shared-key authentication, which is used for 
wireless device authentication and for data encryption. The original standard speciﬁ ed only 
64-bit WEP, which consists of a 40-bit key plus 24-bit WEP initialization vector (IV).
How to Use WEP
WEP is fairly simple to implement. It requires all wireless devices to have the same WEP 
key. The WEP key can be either 64-bit or 128-bit; however, the standard required only 
64-bit WEP. One disadvantage to WEP is that it uses static keys, which means all wireless 
devices—access points, bridges, and client stations—must have the same key and the key 
must be manually entered into them. Any time the key is changed, it must be changed on all 
of the wireless device that are on the same SSID. No matter which you use, 64-bit WEP or 
128-bit WEP, you are still only using a 24-bit IV. 64-bit WEP uses a 40-bit secret key and 
a 24-bit IV. 128-bit WEP uses a 104-bit secret key but still only the 24-bit IV, making both 
vulnerable to the same attacks. Gathering a number of these IVs allows an attacker to crack 
your key in minutes.
Some governing bodies no longer allow the use of WEP. Payment Card 
Industry (PCI), for example, no longer allows the use of WEP for secur-
ing wireless networks. If you are still using WEP, it should be a high 
priority to move away from this legacy security technology as quickly as 
possible.

One major disadvantage of using WEP is that it was compromised early on and is there-
fore not secure. It is easy to capture data using a wireless packet analyzer; with a little 
knowledge and correct software utilities, cracking a WEP key is a simple feat. This made 
WEP a weak security solution, but it was pretty much the only solution available at the 
time of early IEEE 802.11 wireless networking.
With today’s newer and more sophisticated software tools and technology, WEP can 
be cracked easily and quickly. WEP will be discussed in more detail in the section “IEEE 
802.11 Encryption Methods” later in this chapter.

IEEE 802.11 SOHO and Enterprise 
Security Technologies
The IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard provided much improvement in the ways 
wireless LANs can be secured. Enterprise-based wireless LANs are now capable of the 
most up-to-date security solutions available in the industry. This amendment to the stan-
dard introduced what is known as the Robust Secure Network (RSN). In order for wireless 
LAN equipment to create an RSN, it must be RSN capable or 802.11i compliant, which 
means it will optionally support Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and it must also 
support Counter Mode with Cipher-Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol 
(CCMP). The Wi-Fi Alliance has released several certiﬁ cations that pertain to wireless 
networking: WPA and WPA 2.0 for SOHO and enterprise deployments, and WPS for the 
home user.
The following section discusses Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This topic

based or push-button wireless security. Both of these solutions simplify the process of 
securing a wireless network either for the SOHO environment or for home-based users. As 
discussed in Chapter 2, the Wi-Fi Alliance has branded a certiﬁ cation for push-button and 
PIN-based security called Wi-Fi Protected Setup. The Wi-Fi Protected Setup certiﬁ cation 
(WPS) addresses both of these solutions.
In December 2011 a security flaw was reported with WPS. This allegedly 
allowed an intruder to recover the personal identification number (PIN) 
used to create the 256-bit preshared key. Disabling certain features or a 
firmware update may be available to provide adequate protection. Keep in 
mind that this solution to the issue may only be possible with newer-model 
wireless routers. You should check with the manufacturer to determine if 
a solution (either a software setting or firmware upgrade) is available for a 
specific device. See Chapter 2 for more details about this security hole.

PIN-Based Security
Personal identiﬁ cation number (PIN) functionality is required in order for a wireless device 
to be Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) certiﬁ ed. PIN-based security requires a unique PIN to 
be entered on all devices that will be part of the same secure wireless network. A PIN will 
come as either a ﬁ xed label or sticker on a device, or it can be dynamically generated in 
the setup utility and shown on the computer screen. It is important to understand the dif-
ference between a PIN and a passphrase, password, shared key, or preshared key. A PIN 
is a number; the acronym spelled out means “personal identiﬁ cation number.” Therefore 
a PIN will only consist of numbers. Passphrases and the others may contain combinations 
of numbers, letters, and special characters. The registrar device in the case of a wireless 
LAN is the access point. The access point will detect when a new wireless device that sup-
ports WPS is in radio range. When this device tries to join the network, the registrar will 
prompt the user to enter the unique PIN. Once the PIN is entered, the process authenticates 
the device and encrypts the network data sent to and from the device. Figure 9.7 shows an 
example of PIN-based wireless security.

Push-Button Configuration Security
Push-button security or push-button conﬁ guration (PBC) allows users to conﬁ gure wireless 
LAN security with “the push of a button,” making setting up wireless security a one-step 
process. When a user pushes a hardware button on the wireless residential gateway (wire-
less router) and clicks a software button in the software utility for the network adapter 
installed in the client device wanting to associate, push-button security creates a connection 
between the devices, conﬁ gures the network’s SSID, and turns on security. This allows a 
secure connection among all devices that are part of the wireless network. Figure 9.8 shows 
an example of push-button security. The Linksys version of push-button security is called 
SecureEasySetup (SES).

Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
F I G U R E  9. 8  Linksys WRT54G wireless residential gateway/router with push-button 
security (SES)
In order to use SES, all devices, including the wireless residential gateway/router and the 
wireless client adapters, must support the feature. First a button is pushed on the wireless 
residential gateway/router; then a button (a software setting in the wireless  client utility) is 
clicked on the wireless device(s). Usually in less than a minute the process is complete and 
all devices have a secure connection. Only those devices within radio frequency hearing 
range that are participating in the process will become part of the secure network.
Support for both PIN and PBC conﬁ gurations is required for access points; client devices 
at a minimum must support PIN. A third, optional method, near ﬁ eld communication (NFC) 
tokens, is also supported. A USB ﬂ ash drive (memory card or solid-state storage drive with a 
USB interface) may be used to store and transfer credentials. Many SOHO equipment manu-
facturers have Wi-Fi Protected Setup–certiﬁ ed devices on the market today. Some include:

Wi-Fi Protected Access and WPA2 
Personal Security
Passphrase-based security was designed with the SOHO or home-based user in mind. 
This type of security allows a user to create a very secure wireless LAN solution without 
the experience or knowledge necessary to conﬁ gure enterprise-level components such as 
an 802.1X/EAP and a RADIUS server. Passphrase-based security requires all wireless 
devices that are part of the same wireless network to have the same 256-bit preshared 
key (PSK) in order to securely communicate. The capability to derive a secure key of this 
length would be a daunting task; to ease the burden of having to create a long secure key, 
the passphrase was introduced. This works by requiring the user to enter a strong pass-
phrase on all wireless devices that are part of the same wireless LAN to be secured. The 
beneﬁ t of a passphrase is it can be a sequence of words or other text that is memorable 
only to the user who created it. After the passphrase is entered into the device, with the 
help of an electronic algorithm from the IEEE 802.11i amendment, it will create a 256-bit 
preshared key.
Passphrase Characteristics
The characteristics of the passphrase are as follows:


It consists of 8 to 63 ASCII (case sensitive) or 64 hexadecimal characters.


It creates a 256-bit preshared key.


The longer and more random the passphrase, the more secure it will be.


Weak passphrases can be compromised.
Several software programs and websites have random password 
generators to aid in the generation of strong passphrases. One such 
website is Gibson Research Corporation. GRC’s Ultra High Security 
Password Generator can be found at www.grc.com/passwords.htm.
Figure 9.9 shows how to conﬁ gure a passphrase on a SOHO access point.

WPA and WPA2 Enterprise Security
Concerned about problems connected with MAC address ﬁ ltering and WEP, the industry 
drove the development of additional, improved wireless security solutions. One of these 
solutions also operates at Layer 2 and is an IEEE standard. This advanced enterprise-level 
solution is known as IEEE 802.1X, also called user-based security. User-based security 
allows an administrator to restrict access to a wireless network and its resources by creat-
ing users in a centralized database. Anyone trying to join the network will be required to 
authenticate as one of the users by supplying a valid username and password. After success-
ful authentication, the user will be able to gain access to resources for which they have per-
missions. This type of mutual authentication is more secure than the previously mentioned 
passphrase security method.
IEEE 802.1X/EAP
IEEE 802.1X/EAP consists of two different components used together to form an 
enterprise computer network security solution. IEEE 802.1X/EAP is deﬁ ned in the IEEE 
802.11-2012 Standard but was originally part of the IEEE 802.11i amendment. We’ll ﬁ rst 

IEEE 802.1X/EAP

discuss the IEEE 802.1X standard and then Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). 
Then we’ll combine the technology and terms to form IEEE 802.1X/EAP.
IEEE 802.1X
IEEE 802.1X is a port-based access control method and was designed to work with 
IEEE 802.3 Ethernet wired networks. However, this standard was adapted into the 
wireless world as an alternative, more powerful solution to legacy 802.11 wireless 
LAN security technologies. Wireless devices that use 802.1X technology are identiﬁ ed 
using different terminology than that used in IEEE 802.11 standards-based wireless 
networking:

Supplicant  The supplicant is another name for the wireless client device attempting to 
connect to the wireless network. This typically is the software security component of the 
wireless client device and the IEEE 802.1X terminology. 

320 
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
Authenticator  The authenticator is the IEEE 802.1X term for the wireless access point 
or wireless LAN controller. The authenticator acts as a middleman between the wireless 
 supplicant and the authentication server. When the supplicant requests to join the wire-
less network, the authenticator passes the authentication information between the two 
devices.
Authentication Server  The term “authentication server” is used by the IEEE 802.1X 
 standard to identify the server that will authenticate the wireless supplicant. The authenti-
cation server receives all information from the authenticator. The authentication server may 
be an AAA or a RADIUS server; both are explained later in this chapter.
Extensible Authentication Protocol
IEEE 802.1X is a framework that allows for an authentication process. The authentica-
tion process used with IEEE 802.1X is Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). The 
IEEE 802.1X standard will employ some EAP type to complete this process. Many types of 
EAP are available in the industry that can be used with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. 
These vary from proprietary solutions to very secure standard solutions. Examples of some 
 popular EAP types include:


EAP-TLS


TTLS (EAP-MSCHAPv2)


PEAP (EAP-MSCHAPv2)


EAP-FAST
These and other EAP types allow a user to authenticate to a wireless network in 
several ways, including credentials such as username/password or certiﬁ cate-based 
authentication.
The details of EAP and how it works are beyond the scope of the CWTS 
certification and exam objectives. For more information, refer to other 
CWNP materials.
IEEE 802.1X and EAP Together: IEEE 802.1X/EAP
Now it is time to put these two parts together to form the IEEE 802.1X/EAP authentica-
tion process. This authentication process is typically used for enterprise-level security but 
can be and is sometimes used in smaller wireless installations. As mentioned earlier, a vari-
ety of EAP types are available in the industry that work very well with IEEE 802.11 wire-
less LAN deployments. The EAP type chosen will depend on the environment in which the 
wireless LAN is used. EAP types vary in speciﬁ cations, costs, and complexity. Figure 9.11 
shows IEEE 802.1X/EAP conﬁ guration on a cloud-based wireless network management 
system.

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking service that provides 
centralized authentication and administration of users. RADIUS started as a way to authenti-
cate and authorize dial-up networking users. A remote user would dial up to a network using 
the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and a modem. A modem from a modem pool 
on the receiver side would answer the call. The user would then be prompted by a remote 
access server to enter a username and password in order to authenticate. Once the credentials 
were validated, the user would then have access to any resources for which they had permis-
sions. Figure 9.12 illustrates the remote access service authentication mechanism.
In this example, the remote access client would be the computer dialing into the net-
work, and the remote access server would be the one performing the authentication for 
the dial-up user. As computer networks grew in size and complexity and remote access 
technology improved, there was a need to optimize the process on the remote access server 
side. This is where RADIUS provides a solution. RADIUS took decentralized remote access 
services databases and combined them into one central location, allowing for centralized

user administration and centralized management. It eased the burden of having to manage 
several databases and optimized administration of remote access services.

A company does not need a large number of RADIUS servers. For a small to medium-
sized company, one RADIUS server should be sufﬁ cient (with a backup if possible). Larger 
enterprise organizations may need several RADIUS servers across the entire wide area net-
work. In wireless networking, the wireless access point can act as a RADIUS  client, which 
means it will have the capability to accept requests from wireless client devices and forward 
them to the RADIUS server for authentication. Figure 9.13 shows this conﬁ guration.
As Figure 9.13 shows, the remote access client is now the wireless access point. The 
wireless client device is authorized as a user in the database of the RADIUS server. The 
RADIUS server is the authenticating server or database. A RADIUS server may also 
be known as an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server. In this 
 conﬁ guration, it will authenticate users and provide access to the resources for which they 
have permissions. In addition, it will keep track of all transactions by accounting.
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
The Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocol provides a framework 
to allow secure access and authorization as well as keep track of the user’s activities on a 
computer network including wireless networks. AAA is commonly part of a RADIUS server’s 
functionality. The three components that work together in the AAA protocol are:

The First Part of AAA—Authentication
As you learned earlier in this chapter, authentication is deﬁ ned as a way of conﬁ rming 
or validating an identity; for the most part it validates that you are who you say you are. 
Enterprise IEEE 802.11 wireless networks commonly use IEEE 802.1X/EAP or user-based 
authentication technology. In addition to username and passwords, wireless networks may 
also use other authentication methods, including digital certiﬁ cates and smart cards, to 
name a few.
The Second Part of AAA—Authorization
For wireless networking, authorization provides access to network resources that a wireless 
device or user has the appropriate permissions or rights to use. These permissions could be 
tied to an individual user object but can also be tied to a group object. After a user authen-
ticates, the AAA protocol will then allow for the authorization process. Authorization can 
be on a per-user or per-group basis. In IEEE wireless networking technology, authoriza-
tion is commonly used for wireless LAN functionality, including bandwidth controls, time 
restrictions/controls, and quality of service (QoS) policies.
The Third Part of AAA—Accounting
Accounting is the last part or third “A” in the Authentication, Authorization, and 
Accounting (AAA) protocol. Accounting will keep track of every place on the network a 
user visits or everything done on the network. Basically, it monitors all network activity. 

324
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
This can be used for something as simple as tracking resource usage for software or hard-
ware upgrade purposes or for technology budgeting purposes. Accounting can be used to 
determine what technology different areas of the organization are using and how they will 
be able to contribute to the cost of this technology.
IEEE 802.11 Encryption Methods
In the most basic sense, encryption consists of taking information and scrambling it so 
only the sender and intended recipient that know the encryption method are able to deci-
pher the encrypted information. In addition to authenticating and verifying an identity, 
encryption also needs to be considered for wireless networking. In the IEEE 802.11 stan-
dard, three different encryption mechanisms can be used on a wireless network to protect 
data trafﬁ c:


Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)


Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)


Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol 
(CCMP)
Wired Equivalent Privacy
As discussed earlier in this chapter, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was an optional 
encryption method speciﬁ ed in the original IEEE 802.11 standard. WEP was only intended 
to protect wireless network users against casual eavesdropping and for IEEE 802.11 
shared-key authentication. As discussed, this encryption method is considered legacy and 
was compromised early on, making it a weak solution to use with modern wireless net-
works. With early deployments of standards-based wireless networking, WEP was the only 
solution available, which made it very popular. At that time, the capability to crack WEP 
was available but that did not mean anyone could do it. Initially, cracking WEP required 
a large amount of data, some knowledge of the process, and usually a software program 
to extract the WEP key. Newer technology has made cracking WEP a very simple process. 
WEP can be cracked in minutes rather than hours, days, or weeks and almost anyone can 
do it. The fact that WEP is available in two key lengths—64-bit or 128-bit—makes no dif-
ference to the experienced intruder. WEP uses the RC4 stream cipher for bit-level encryp-
tion. The problem with WEP does not lie in RC4 but in how it was used in the encryption 
process. One reason WEP is vulnerable to intrusion is because of something called an ini-
tialization vector (IV). The 24-bit IV is broadcast in the clear or unencrypted. This being 
the case, it exposes a weakness in the way WEP was designed, thereby allowing it to be 
compromised.

IEEE 802.11 Encryption Methods
325
Is WEP Still Used?
WEP is weak and because of vulnerabilities can be cracked. Therefore, using WEP is not a 
recommended solution to secure wireless computer data. Many countries have not fallen 
under PCI’s scrutiny yet and still use WEP to protect wireless networks. Older voice over 
Wi-Fi phones and barcode scanners may still use WEP.
As a general rule, it is best not to use WEP as a security measure for protection of a wire-
less network and its users. However, there are still some deployments that use devices 
with wireless networking that have limited capabilities when it comes to security. WEP 
may be the only security option they have. If upgrading the devices to something that 
supports higher-level security is not an option, the organization may have no choice but 
to use WEP. If this is the case, it is important for the network administrator to use appro-
priate device segmentation for the WEP-enabled devices in order to not compromise the 
entire network infrastructure. One way to do this is to consider the use of a virtual local 
area network (VLAN). This gives the administrator the ability to separate wireless devices 
that may be potentially compromised because of WEP from other devices that are capa-
ble of more advanced security solutions.
There are many software programs available to allow someone with limited knowledge to 
be able to crack WEP. As mentioned earlier, newer, more sophisticated tools allow WEP to be 
cracked in minutes. If a wireless network has the capability of more advanced security such 
as 802.11i, WPA, or WPA 2.0, one of those should be used instead of WEP. An appropriate 
device upgrade path should be evaluated in order to eliminate the use of WEP in any capacity 
on the wireless network.
Preventing WEP from Being Cracked with a Patented Technology Called 
WEP Cloaking
You are a network consultant and have been assigned the task to evaluate a wireless net-
work in a retail establishment that currently uses wireless barcode scanners for a variety 
of applications. You determine that these devices currently have no security solution 
enabled. After evaluating the system, you come to the conclusion that the only possible 
wireless security solution that can be applied to these devices is WEP.
You know from experience that WEP is not secure and can be compromised. Therefore 
you make a recommendation to the IT manager to upgrade all of the wireless barcode 
scanners to support a higher level security such as WPA 2.0 to adequately secure the 
data. You are told by the IT manager that unfortunately the budget for the current year 
will not allow hardware upgrade of the devices. This being the case, you have an alter-
nate solution. This organization currently is considering a WIPS solution.

326 
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
The capability to crack WEP has been available for many years through a variety of 
 freeware WEP cracking tools. There are 23 known attacks against the original 802.11 
encryption standard for either 64-bit or 128-bit WEP. Through the use of sophisticated 
utilities, WEP can be cracked in minutes regardless of the key strength. One solution 
known as WEP Cloaking allows organizations to operate WEP-encrypted networks 
securely and preserve their existing investment in mobile devices such as barcode 
scanners. This patented WEP Cloaking technology will make these popular freeware 
cracking tools useless. This solution would allow the company to maintain the current 
barcode scanner technology and still provide a secure wireless solution for the orga-
nization. Keep in mind that WEP Cloaking is one manufacturer’s method to protect 
legacy devices forced to use WEP until they can be replaced with newer, more secure 
devices.
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) was designed as a ﬁ rmware upgrade to WEP. 
TKIP added several enhancements to the WEP algorithm and was the foundation for the 
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) certiﬁ cation from the Wi-Fi Alliance. These enhancements 
include:


Per-packet key mixing of the IV to separate IVs from weak keys


A dynamic rekeying mechanism to change encryption and integrity keys


48-bit IV and IV sequence counter to prevent replay attacks


Message Integrity Check (MIC) to prevent forgery attacks


Use of the RC4 stream cipher, thereby allowing backward compatibility with WEP
Conﬁ guring a wireless network to use TKIP is a fairly straightforward process. It can 
be accomplished either by using the web interface available on most SOHO access points 
or by using the web interface or command-line interface for enterprise-level access points. 
For the wireless client devices, TKIP will be conﬁ gured through the client software 
 utility. Some older wireless hardware devices may not support TKIP. If this is the case, 
replacement of the hardware will be necessary in order to take advantage of newer secu-
rity solutions. Figure 9.14 shows how to conﬁ gure TKIP using WPA on a wireless LAN 
controller.
TKIP/RC4 uses a 48-bit IV and can be compromised in the same way as 
WEP if a weak key is used. Using a stronger technique such as CCMP/AES 
is a better solution.

Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message 
Authentication Code Protocol
Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol
(CCMP) is a mandatory part of the IEEE 801.11i amendment, now in the IEEE 802.11-
2012 standard and part of Wi-Fi Protected Access 2.0 (WPA2) certiﬁ cation from the Wi-Fi 
Alliance. CCMP uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm block cipher. 
CCMP is mandatory for robust security network (RSN) compliance. If an RSN is required 
to comply with an industry or governmental regulation, CCMP must be used. CCMP is 
also intended as a replacement to TKIP. Because of the strong encryption CCMP provides, 
it may require replacement of legacy hardware. In some cases, it may use a separate chip to 
perform computation-intensive AES ciphering.
Conﬁ guration of CCMP is similar to that of TKIP, discussed earlier. The main differ-
ence with CCMP is that older hardware may not support it and it is a stronger encryption 
solution. Figure 9.15 shows conﬁ guring the CCMP method using WPA2.

Upgrading the Firmware on Wireless LAN Devices
In some cases, it may be necessary to upgrade the device ﬁ rmware in order to get either 
TKIP or CCMP capability. It is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions when 
upgrading ﬁ rmware to prevent damage to the device. Improper ﬁ rmware upgrades or a 
loss of power during the upgrade process may render the device unusable or require the 
device to be sent back to the manufacturer for repair.
Some of the security technologies we just discussed are part of the Wi-Fi Alliance 
interoperability testing for standards-based wireless LAN equipment. As mentioned 
in Chapter 2, equipment certiﬁ ed for both WPA and WPA2 can function in either 
personal or enterprise modes. Table 9.2 shows the details of both WPA and WPA 2 
certiﬁ cations.

Role-Based Access Control
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a way of restricting access to only authorized users. 
This access is from authentication based on speciﬁ c roles rather than user identities. It was 
designed to ease the task of security administration on large networks. RBAC has charac-
teristics similar to those of a common network administration practice—the creation of 
users and groups. RBAC may also ﬁ t well under the authorization part of AAA because it 
has very similar characteristics.
To give a user on a computer network access to a network resource, best practices rec-
ommend creating a group object, assigning the group permissions to the resource, and 
then adding the user object to the group. This method allows any user who is a member of 
the group to be granted access to the resource. Role-based access control can be used for 
various activities users may perform while connected to a wireless LAN, including limit-
ing the amount of throughput, enforcing time restrictions, or controlling access to speciﬁ c 
resources such as the Internet. 
Let’s look at an example. Your organization consists of several departments that use 
resources available on the wireless network. The departments are sales, engineering, and 
accounting. Each department has speciﬁ c requirements for what and when they need to 
access from the wireless LAN. This is where RBAC would be a great ﬁ t. If the network 
administrator wanted to restrict access to the wireless LAN for the sales department 
from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., she could create a role using this feature. If the engineering 
department was using too much bandwidth, a role could be created to restrict throughput 
for that department. These are a couple of examples where RBAC can work with a wire-
less LAN.

Virtual Private Networking
Virtual private networking (VPN) is the capability to create private communications over 
a public network infrastructure such as the Internet. The security solutions discussed ear-
lier in this chapter are Layer 2 security solutions; that is, all such solutions work at Layer 
2 of the OSI model. By contrast, VPNs are Internet Protocol–based—they typically oper-
ate at Layer 3 of the OSI model but some will work at Layer 2. Figure 9.16 illustrates VPN 
 technology in relationship to the OSI model.

Prior to the ratiﬁ cation of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard, VPN technol-
ogy was prevalent in enterprise deployments as well as in remote access security. Since 
Layer 2 security solutions have become stronger (mostly thanks to the 802.11i amendment 
and the Wi-Fi Alliance WPA and WPA2 certiﬁ cations), VPN technology is not as widely 
used within enterprise LANs. However, VPN still remains a powerful security solution for 
remote access in both wired and wireless networking.
VPNs consist of two parts—tunneling and encryption. Figure 9.17 illustrates a VPN 
tunnel using the Internet. A standalone VPN tunnel does not provide data encryption, 
and VPN tunnels are created across Internet Protocol (IP) networks. In a very basic sense, 
VPNs use encapsulation methods where one IP frame is encapsulated within a second IP 
frame. The encryption of VPNs is performed as a separate function.

Shipping a Crate Using VPN Technology
An analogy for the VPN process is shipping a locked crate from one location to 
another. You are a technical support engineer for the headquarters ofﬁ ce of a 
company that has ﬁ ve ofﬁ ces in different locations around the world. You get a 
telephone call from a co-worker at one of the remote ofﬁ ces. She needs to replace 
an access point with a newer model at the remote ofﬁ ce. You need to ship the pre-
conﬁ gured replacement access point to her using a common carrier. You want to 
ensure that the access point arrives at the destination location without coming into 
physical contact with anybody other than the intended recipient.
The access point is analogous to the IP frame. You put the access point into a crate that 
has a combination lock to secure it. This crate containing the access point is analogous to 
the second IP frame, or the one that encapsulates the original IP frame.
You ship the crate to the destination using a common carrier, which would be analogous 
to the public infrastructure over which the encrypted data is sent. Many other packages 
are shipped by this common carrier, but no one will be able to see the contents of the 
crate because they do not know the combination to the lock (the encryption method).
When the access point arrives at the destination, the recipient (the technical support engi-
neer for the remote ofﬁ ce) must know the combination of the lock on the crate in order to 
open it to retrieve the access point. So you tell her the combination over the telephone. 
This is analogous to the encryption method. Over a secure telephone line, only you (the 
sender) and she (the recipient) know the combination to the lock. The tech support engi-
neer will be able to unlock the crate using the combination you supplied her, and she will 
be able to retrieve the access point.
Two common types of VPN protocols are:


Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)


Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
Developed by a vendor consortium that included Microsoft, Point-to-Point Tunneling 
Protocol (PPTP) was very popular because of its ease of conﬁ guration and was included in 
all Microsoft Windows operating systems starting with Windows 95. PPTP uses Microsoft 
Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE-128) Protocol for encryption. This process provides both 
tunneling and encryption capabilities for the user’s data.

332 
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
If the PPTP configuration uses MS-CHAP version 2 for user authentication 
on a wireless network, it can be a security issue. This authentication pro-
cess can be captured using a wireless protocol analyzer or other scanning 
software program and potentially allow someone to perform a dictionary 
attack, allowing them to acquire a user’s credentials and eventually giving 
them the capability to log on to the network. A dictionary attack is per-
formed by software that challenges the encrypted password against com-
mon words or phrases in a text file (dictionary). Therefore, using PPTP on a 
wireless network should be avoided. Keep in mind that the security vulner-
ability is not PPTP itself; it is that the authentication frames on a wireless 
LAN can be captured by an intruder, who can then acquire user credentials 
(username and password) and be able to gain access to the VPN. 
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is the combination of two different tunneling proto-
cols: Cisco’s Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) and Microsoft’s Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol 
(PPTP). L2TP deﬁ nes the tunneling process, which requires some level of encryption in 
order to function. With L2TP, a popular choice of encryption is Internet Protocol Security 
(IPSec), which provides authentication and encryption for each IP packet in a data stream. 
Since L2TP was published in 1999 as a proposed standard and because it is more secure 
than PPTP, L2TP has gained much popularity and for the most part is a replacement for 
PPTP. L2TP/IPSec is a very common VPN solution in use today. PPTP should not be used 
when L2TP is available.
Components of a VPN Solution
A VPN solution consists of three components:


Client side (endpoint)


Network infrastructure (public or private)


Server side (endpoint)
In many cases, both client side and server side are known as VPN endpoints. The infra-
structure in many cases is a public access network such as the Internet. The client-side 
endpoint typically consists of software, allowing it to be conﬁ gured for the VPN. This 
software is available at a nominal cost from a variety of manufacturers. Newer Microsoft 
Windows operating systems include VPN client software for both PPTP and L2TP. 
Figure 9.18 shows a VPN client conﬁ guration screen.
Wireless LAN client devices have the capability to be a VPN client endpoint. The VPN 
can terminate either at an access point or across the Internet to the corporate network. 
Figure 9.19 shows a common example of a wireless client device connecting to a wireless 
hotspot to access the corporate network.

The Wireless Intrusion Prevention 
System
In wireless networking, a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) is a software/hard-
ware solution that monitors the radio waves and, using a wireless hardware sensor, can 
report captured information to software to be recorded in a server database (this differs 
from other network monitoring and management systems discussed later in this chapter). 
The WIPS solution will then be able to take the appropriate countermeasures to prevent 
wireless network intrusions. These countermeasures are based on identifying the intru-
sion by comparing the captured information to an intrusion signature database within the 
WIPS server. Figure 9.20 shows a WIPS dashboard that displays a Layer 1 radio frequency 
jamming denial of service (DoS) attack that was recorded.
There are many advantages to using a WIPS. Some of them include:


Captures information by 24/7 monitoring


Detects threats to the wireless infrastructure such as DoS attacks and rogue access 
points


Notifies you about threats through a variety of mechanisms


Supports integrated spectrum analysis


Includes elaborate reporting systems


Ensures compliance with corporate security policy and legislative compliance


Retains data for forensic investigation


Uses hardware sensors for monitoring
24/7/365 Monitoring  With a WIPS, monitoring of the wireless network can be 
accomplished 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to help identify potential attacks, 
including DoS, either from Layer 1 RF or from Layer 2 software such as a deauthenti-
cation storm. A WIPS also ﬁ nds rogue (unauthorized) access points and misconﬁ gured 
wireless devices.
Detection and Mitigation  Unlike many wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS), 
WIPS has the capability to detect and react. WIPS solutions will automatically respond to 
threats against a wireless LAN by stopping the device or process that contains the threat 
before it has a chance to cause any damage to the wireless network.

attack that was reported.
Notification of Threats  WIPS solutions have the capability to provide notiﬁ cations to net-
work administrators based on alerts and alarms of potential threats that the WIPS encoun-
ters during monitoring. These notiﬁ cations can be provided in a variety of ways, such as 
email or pager.
Integrated Spectrum Analysis  This feature allows an administrator to view the state of a 
remote radio environment at a branch ofﬁ ce or remote location. This allows the accurate 
diagnosis of radio spectrum problems, including Layer 1 DoS attacks.
Elaborate Reporting Systems  In addition to standard reports, most WIPS solutions allow 
network administrators to create their own customized reports in a short period of time. 
These reports will enable an organization to meet the speciﬁ c requirements of audit groups, 
either internal or external to the organization.

The Wireless Intrusion Prevention System
339
Regulatory Policy Compliance  A WIPS will have the capability to help ensure that an 
organization maintains the necessary legislative compliance. Compliance requirements 
include Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Payment Card 
Industry (PCI).
Retains Data for Forensics  Many WIPS solutions can retain data that may be used in 
forensics investigations. The WIPS will provide the documented proof an organization 
may require to take the appropriate action based on events recorded. WIPS solutions will 
require ﬁ ne-tuning to some degree to eliminate misrepresentation of the threat signatures 
the system will detect. This starts with a baseline of the environment, allowing the admin-
istrator to gauge the levels of detection and reaction.
Uses Hardware Sensors for Monitoring  WIPS solutions will use either dedicated hard-
ware sensors or share the sensor functionality with access points. These sensors will col-
lect data by monitoring the air 24/7 and allowing information to be reported to a server 
database.
WIPS Configuration and Maintenance
Although a WIPS solution is a valuable tool to use for wireless LAN monitoring and 
detection/mitigation of wireless intrusions, it needs to be set up, conﬁ gured, and main-
tained correctly. Installing a WIPS system without setting the appropriate thresholds 
and baselines may result in unreliable or unusable collections of information. For 
example, if an organization is concerned about deauthentication attacks, such as forc-
ing a “deauthentication storm” (sending many consecutive deauthentication frames), 
this setting will need to be enabled on the WIPS system with the appropriate threshold 
setting in order to be detected. Remember from Chapter 8 that deauthentication occurs 
when an existing authentication is no longer valid, and it can be caused by a wireless 
LAN device logging off from the current connection or roaming to a different BSS. If 
an intruder sends just a couple of deauthentication frames to a wireless device in an 
attempt to force them to reauthenticate, and thus perform a hijack attack, the activity 
may fall under the threshold set for the deauthentication frames that are monitored and 
could be missed. The bottom line is that proper setup, conﬁ guration, and maintenance 
of a WIPS system all need to be carefully considered. Figure 9.21 shows the policy 
setup screen for a WIPS.
Overlay and Integrated WIPS Technology
A WIPS requires hardware sensors for monitoring and sending the data to the WIPS server. 
These sensors can be dedicated devices (only used for monitoring) or can share functional-
ity with the wireless access points. The terminology used for these WIPS sensors is:


Overlay WIPS sensors


Integrated WIPS sensors

Overlay WIPS Sensors
Overlay WIPS sensors are dedicated wireless devices that have physical characteristics 
similar to those of wireless access points but are only used for scanning the air and sending 
data to a WIPS server. These devices are passive and will not interfere with other wireless 
LAN devices such as access points. This type of sensor does not need to be implemented on 
a 1:1 deployment. In other words you do not need one WIPS sensor with every one access 
point. WIPS sensors are commonly installed in a 1:3 or 1:4 ratio. Figure 9.22 shows how a 
WIPS overlay solution uses dedicated sensors.
It is best to check with the WIPS manufacturer to determine the recommended number 
of dedicated sensors. Some wireless site survey software tools will specify the number and 
locations of the sensors required, based on the wireless network design. One disadvantage 
to the overlay solution is extra cost for the dedicated sensors. Some manufacturers allow a 
wireless access point to run as a dedicated sensor; for these, the cost would be the same as 
the wireless access point.

Integrated WIPS Sensors
Integrated WIPS sensors are part of a wireless access point’s functionality. An integrated 
sensor may have a dedicated radio for full-time WIPS monitoring, or it may share a radio 
with the access point for part-time WIPS monitoring. A dedicated WIPS radio that is built 
into the wireless access point will be able to monitor the air and send data directly to the 
WIPS server full time. This would be the radio’s only function. One beneﬁ t to this type 
of sensor is that the cost will be less than that of the overlay system, because it does not 
requires separate dedicated WIPS sensors. However, the cost may be a little higher than if 
it were only an access point because of the additional radio for the WIPS capability. The 
other type of integrated WIPS sensor is the one that shares a radio with the access point. 
The downside to this is that the WIPS monitoring will only be part-time and will not be 
able to capture everything that is going on. Figure 9.23 shows a WIPS integrated solution, 
consisting of a WIPS sensor and access point in the same device (wireless access point).

Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
Integrated WIPS Sensor Analogy
Think about this analogy. An after-hours security officer is sitting at a desk watching 
the security monitors for any unauthorized access or other activities that could be 
a security violation. The officer hears a noise down the hall and leaves his post to 
investigate. Because he has stepped away from the desk, he cannot be watching the 
security monitors at the same time. Therefore an unauthorized person may be able to 
enter the area without being noticed by the security officer. This is similar to the way 
an access point that is a part-time integrated WIPS sensor and that is servicing wireless 
client devices may not be able to see and detect potential WIPS violations. For example, 
if the wireless access point is providing voice over wireless access, because of QoS 
features the access point will prioritize the wireless voice frames and may forgo the WIPS 
monitoring. This will result in the WIPS server not being able to capture potential wireless 
intrusions or other wireless security violations.
Making the decision to use an overlay or integrated WIPS may be a tough one. It may 
come down to what you are trying to prevent and what you are trying to protect. It 
may also come down to cost. The bottom line is this: If you are planning to install a 
WIPS, evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each type carefully. One of the 
main goals of a WIPS is to enforce functional (technical) corporate security policy 
24/7/365.
The Captive Portal
A captive portal is a process that redirects a user to an authentication source of some type 
before they will be allowed wireless network access. This authentication source in the 
form of a web page will require a user to “authenticate” in some way and may include the 
following:


Enter user credentials (username and password).


Input payment information.


Agree to terms and conditions.
When one or more of these methods is complete, a wireless device will then be able to 
access the network and use whatever resources they have permission to access. Most if 
not all public access wireless networks should have some type of captive portal enabled. 
This will help to protect both the provider (host) and the user of the wireless network. 
At a minimum, requiring the user to agree to terms and conditions via a captive portal 
should be implemented.

Wireless Network Management and Monitoring Systems
343
Most enterprise-grade wireless access points, including cooperative access points and 
wireless LAN controllers, have “built-in” captive portal capabilities that are fairly straight-
forward to implement.
Wireless Network Management and 
Monitoring Systems
Wireless network management and monitoring systems are software- or hardware-based 
solutions that allow a wireless network engineer to both control and administer wireless 
infrastructure devices and collect information that may be used to troubleshoot and resolve 
wireless LAN issues. The information collected may consist of either Physical Layer infor-
mation (radio frequency) or Data Link Layer information (wireless LAN frames). 
In the early days of standards-based IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, only autonomous 
access points for the most part were available; there was no centralized management or 
control. (Autonomous access points are discussed in Chapter 2.) To manage these infra-
structure devices, you would need to conﬁ gure each device separately. This could be done 
by connecting either through the command-line interface or a web-based  interface, and 
individual conﬁ guration worked well if only a few infrastructure devices were installed. 
However, as the need for wireless LAN technology grew, so did the number of devices 
or access points. Managing a large number of infrastructure devices manually was not 
feasible. This is where the wireless network management system (WNMS) evolved. The 
WNMS is a centralized solution that was originally available in either software form 
to run on a server or hardware form to run as a standalone network appliance. (We’ll 
look at a third option, cloud-based WNMS solutions, next.) A WNMS would allow a 
network  engineer to manage and control the entire wireless LAN centrally. These central-
ized  management systems are available from many manufacturers for use with their own 
infrastructure devices and are available as vendor-neutral solutions to work with many 
different manufacturers’ equipment. A WNMS may also incorporate WIPS technology for 
a complete wireless network management, monitoring, and security solution. Figure 9.24 
shows a WNMS dashboard.
WNMS: Software, Hardware, or Cloud?
As you just learned, a WNMS is available in different forms—software that will run on a 
server, hardware that will run on a dedicated appliance, and now cloud-based WNMS solu-
tions. This newest option is growing in popularity. With the evolution of standards-based 
wireless LAN technology, the wireless LAN controller worked as a substitute for WNMS, 
offering control and management of the complete wireless LAN infrastructure. However, 
as the wireless networks continued to grow, so did the need for a WNMS. Figure 9.25 
shows a cloud-based wireless network management system.

Wireless Network Monitoring
In addition to wireless network management solutions, you need to understand wireless 
network monitoring solutions. These monitoring solutions are in addition to the WIPS you 
learned about earlier in this chapter. They allow a wireless network engineer to monitor the 
performance of a wireless network at the Physical layer and the Data Link layer for both 
troubleshooting and security information gathering purposes.
Physical Layer Monitoring
Physical Layer monitoring allows the wireless network engineer to see what is happening 
in the air as it relates to radio frequency. This is usually accomplished with the use of a 
spectrum analyzer, which allows an engineer to “see” the radio frequency and thus detect 
potential interference issues and also security issues. Interference from both wireless LAN 
devices and other wireless devices such as two-way radios or microwave ovens will be vis-
ible with the help of a spectrum analyzer. The spectrum analyzer will also detect Layer 1 
security issues such as a narrow-band or wide-band radio frequency denial-of-service (DoS) 
attack. Figure 9.26 shows how a spectrum analyzer can see the Physical layer information 
and detect potential security threats.

Data Link Layer Monitoring
Data Link layer monitoring means looking at the Layer 2 information; it allows a network 
engineer to view the wireless LAN frames that traverse the air and provides the opportu-
nity to view both potential performance and security issues. Protocol analysis tools allow 
the engineer to view both frame exchanges and frame decoding by expanding on the 
captured wireless frames. From a security point of view, these tools can provide valuable 
wireless network information for both the wireless network engineer as well as a potential 

Industry Regulatory Compliance 
347
intruder. The wireless network engineer will be able to ﬁ nd potential security conﬁ guration 
issues that could open the door to intruders. If an intruder were to capture wireless frames, 
such as the preshared key 4-way handshake, they might (depending on how strong the 
passphrase is) be able to use a dictionary attack software program and determine the pass-
phrase; this would allow them to gain access to the wireless network and potentially see a 
user’s encrypted data.
Some wireless LAN analyzers are able to capture and reconstruct TCP/IP frames and 
reconstruct a session and allow web pages to be seen or email messages to be read directly 
from the captured wireless frames. Keep in mind that this is possible on an open wireless 
network or one on which the intruder has been able to capture the frames that allow them 
to access the wireless LAN and to decode the data frames. Some common wireless LAN 
protocol analyzers are:

ers’ websites for more information on how to obtain a trial version of their 
software.
The topic of regulatory compliance, discussed next, is not included in the 
exam objectives but is explained here for your own reference.
Industry Regulatory Compliance
It is very important for companies, organizations, and businesses that collect private or 
personal information from individuals to secure that information appropriately. In recent 
years, there have been several legislative regulations that various businesses are required 
to conform to. This legislation regulates how data is handled for businesses such as health 
care, retail, ﬁ nancial, and others. Plans for complying with them are known as legislative 

348 
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
compliances. When using wireless networks, companies must verify any additional require-
ments from a security perspective that may be needed when dealing with regulatory compli-
ance. This section brieﬂ y describes some of these legislative compliance requirements.
PCI Compliance
PCI stands for Payment Card Industry and is a regulation requiring companies to adhere to 
security standards created to protect card information pertaining to ﬁ nancial transactions. 
According to the PCI Standards Council, in order to be PCI-compliant a company must 
meet the following six requirements:


Build and maintain a secure network.


Protect cardholder data.


Maintain a vulnerability management program.


Implement strong access control measures.


Regularly monitor and test networks.


Maintain an information security policy.
For more information on PCI, visit the PCI Security Standards Council web-
site at www.pcisecuritystandards.org.
HIPAA Compliance
HIPAA is the abbreviation for the United States Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996. The goal of HIPAA is to provide standardized mechanisms for 
electronic data exchange, security, and conﬁ dentiality of all healthcare-related computer 
information and data. HIPAA consists of two parts:


HIPAA, Title I


HIPAA, Title II
If someone loses or changes their job, Title I of HIPAA protects their health insurance 
coverage.
In the information technology industries, Title II is what most people mean when they 
refer to HIPAA; it establishes mandatory regulations that require extensive changes to the 
way that healthcare providers conduct business by securing computer information and 
data.
For more information on HIPAA, visit the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services website at www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa.

Summary
349
Summary
In this chapter, we brieﬂ y discussed network intrusion and the impact it can have on a 
wireless LAN. We also took a look at IEEE 802.11 security methods and a quick review 
from Chapter 8 of the authentication types deﬁ ned in the IEEE 802.11 standard, open sys-
tem and shared key. We explored some of the IEEE 802.11 WLAN security technologies, 
including:


SSID hiding


MAC address filtering


Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
We discussed the vulnerabilities in each of these solutions. We showed an example of 
how the SSID could be hidden from view and also discussed why this is not a good security 
method—because other wireless frames contain the SSID, and it can be found even though 
it is removed from a beacon frame. You saw how MAC address ﬁ ltering can be spoofed 
using freeware utilities downloadable from the Internet or through the computer operating 
system. We also looked at the last of three security solutions, WEP, and illustrated how it 
could be compromised; as you learned, it is a weak wireless security solution. 
In addition to the legacy security solutions, we explored some of the more modern 
solutions:
SOHO and home-based solutions


Passphrase/preshared key


Push-button or PIN-based configuration
Enterprise-based solutions


802.1X/EAP


RADIUS and AAA
You learned that encryption consists of taking information and scrambling it so that 
only the sender and the intended recipient, who know the algorithm, will be able to 
decipher the data. We looked at three types of encryption used in IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networking:


WEP


TKIP


CCMP
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a component for administration of wireless net-
works that allows access and authorization based on individual groups and users and other 
parameters.
We also discussed virtual private networking (VPN), commonly a Layer 3 solution 
that provides a secure connection over a public infrastructure such as the Internet. You 

350
Chapter 9  Wireless LAN Security Basics
saw how VPN technology can be a solution for wireless network users from a remote 
location to access corporate or other networks from a hotspot or other unsecured wire-
less LAN. We also compared PPTP and L2TP and discussed the differences between 
them. PPTP using MS-CHAP version 2 is not a good security solution for wireless LANs, 
because the  authentication can be captured and potentially compromised through a dic-
tionary attack. 
You saw how a captive portal can be used to redirect a user to a web authentication page 
requiring authentication or an agreement of terms and conditions prior to getting network 
access.
Products are available for enterprise wireless LANs that will monitor the airwaves 
24/7 and record all activity detected by the wireless sensors. We discussed these solutions, 
known as a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS), which have the capability to 
detect and react to a potential intrusion on the wireless network. You learned that WIPS 
sensors are available in an overlay or integrated technology. Wireless network manage-
ment systems (WNMS) are available in software-, hardware-, or cloud-based solutions. A 
WNMS will allow for centralized management and control of the wireless and possibly 
wired infrastructure. A WNMS may have some WIPS capability.
We also addressed the functionality and features of these solutions. Finally, we discussed 
regulatory compliances such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) and Payment Card Industry (PCI), and the importance of securing computer data 
for industries such as healthcare, retail, and ﬁ nancial.
Exam Essentials
Be familiar with 802.11 legacy security technologies.  Know the characteristics and 
features of security methods, including service set identiﬁ er (SSID), media access control 
(MAC) ﬁ ltering, and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), and the weaknesses or vulnerabili-
ties of each.
Understand passphrase-based security.  Identify the components of passphrase-based secu-

THE FOLLOWING CWTS EXAM OBJECTIVES 
ARE COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:

information prior to the site survey and do reporting after 
the site survey

This is the ﬁ rst of two chapters discussing wireless LAN site 
surveys. This chapter covers site survey planning and the busi-
ness aspects related to a wireless LAN site survey, including 
gathering business requirements, interviewing the appropriate people, and gathering addi-
tional information regarding the location in which the network will be installed. Chapter 
11, “Performing an RF Wireless LAN Site Survey,” will discuss the technical aspects of 
performing a site survey.
Early deployments for wireless LANs in many cases required only a onetime site survey. 
This is because wireless LAN technology was fairly static and the radio frequency dynam-
ics of the locations in which these networks were installed did not change much. However, 
thanks to the rapid pace at which wireless LAN technology and deployments are growing 
and the increasing use of other devices that use unlicensed radio frequency, site surveys can 
be an ongoing process for the areas where these wireless networks are installed. Although 
there are no set rules about when or how wireless site surveys should be performed, there 
are guidelines that many manufacturers suggest based on deployment scenarios for wireless 
networks that use their equipment. 
In this chapter you will learn about site survey requirements such as understanding 
the business requirements for the intended use of the wireless LAN and asking plenty of 
questions by interviewing department managers and users to help determine the applica-
tions and security requirements for the proposed network. Gathering information is a 
major part of a site survey to ensure a successful deployment. You will also learn about 
the importance of documenting every step, from the design to the installation, and the 
validation of the wireless network.
Wireless LAN Site Surveys
The main objectives of a wireless LAN site survey are to ﬁ nd areas of RF coverage and RF 
interference sources as well as installation locations for hardware infrastructure devices 
such as access points, bridges, antennas, and any other devices that will be used with the 
wireless LAN. This will help ensure that applications to be used—both hardware and soft-
ware—will be supported by the wireless network. Site surveys vary in complexity, depend-
ing on the organization or location in which a wireless network will be used.
As mentioned earlier, there is not a speciﬁ c set of rules that must be followed. However, 
many manufacturers of wireless LAN equipment have guidelines and suggestions when 
it comes to a wireless site survey and where this survey ﬁ ts into the process of design and 
implementation of the wireless network.

Wireless LAN Site Surveys
359
Knowing and understanding the expectations of the client or business in regard to 
the wireless LAN is a critical part of a successful deployment. To understand these client 
expectations, you have to gather much information. This includes interviews and meetings 
with all those who will be affected by the installation of the wireless LAN, which encom-
passes nearly all departments of the company in most installations.
The scope of the wireless LAN site survey is dependent on many factors, some of which 
include:


Size of physical location


Intended use of the network


Number of users and devices


Wireless client device capabilities


The wireless LAN environment


Performance expectations


Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) acceptance
Size of Physical Location
Depending on the size of the physical location where the wireless network will be installed, 
a complete wireless LAN site survey may not be necessary. For example, a small sandwich 
shop wishes to offer free wireless Internet access as a convenience for its patrons who 
choose to have a meal there. This sandwich shop is approximately 1,200 square feet, has 
seating for about 15 people, and is located in a small street retail mall. In this case, a single 
access point would more than likely be sufﬁ cient for the number of users who access the 
wireless network at any one time and the type of data being sent across the access point. 
Although a full-blown site survey determining areas of RF interference coverage and 
interference would more than likely not be required, it would still be beneﬁ cial to visit the 
location and determine the best place for the access point. In a situation like this, what I 
like to call a “site survey lite” may be all that is necessary. This would include testing the 
area to determine the best RF channel to use as well as access point mounting, consider-
ation of aesthetics, and connecting to the wired network for access to the Internet. 
A larger installation will require a more extensive site survey and may include either a 
manual physical RF site survey or a predictive modeling site survey using elaborate soft-
ware. Manual and predictive modeling site survey software will be discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 11.
Intended Use of the Network
Looking at the sandwich shop scenario again, chances are the intended use of this wireless 
network will consist of patrons staying online for short periods of time and browsing the 
Internet or checking email. It is unlikely that many users would be performing any high-
end or bandwidth-intensive applications on this type of connection. Therefore, the single–
access point model would be sufﬁ cient for this deployment. With larger installations, the 

360
Chapter 10  Wireless LAN Site Survey Basics
use of the network may include bandwidth-intensive applications such as electronic imag-
ing, computer-aided design, or database programs and would have an impact on the num-
ber of access points that would be required in order to provide adequate performance.
Number of Users and Devices
The number of users or devices that will be accessing a wireless network is also a factor in 
determining the number of access points required, which in turn will determine the scope 
of a site survey. It has already been established that in our sandwich shop example a single 
access point would be sufﬁ cient based on the size of the location and the intended use of 
the network. However, as the number of actual wireless-enabled devices grows and because 
of the added capacity requirements, the need for additional access points will also increase. 
In a case where more than one access point is required, a more extensive wireless site sur-
vey is also required.
Wireless Client Device Capabilities
In addition to the number of users and wireless client devices, it is important to understand 
the types of devices that will be connected to the wireless LAN and what their capabili-
ties are. For example, notebook computers or handheld devices such as tablets and smart 
phones all have speciﬁ c functionality and will need to meet certain requirements. This type 
of device could be performing tasks as simple as basic web browsing or checking email. 
Other possible device types include Wi-Fi–enabled voice handsets that may need their own 
SSIDs for quality of service functionality and operate in the 5 GHz UNII band or barcode 
scanners that will be keeping track of inventory. 
Part of the wireless site survey planning process is to question the appropriate people 
regarding the types of devices and understanding what their capabilities are to ensure that 
expectations of the users will be met. Some of the capabilities that need to be considered are:


IEEE 802.11b/g only


IEEE 802.11a or dual band capable


IEEE 802.11n capable and number of transmit and receive radio chains


MIMO capabilities, such as the number of spatial streams or transmit beamforming


Notebook computers, desktop computers, or tablets


Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags for location services


Wi-Fi–enabled voice handsets and the operating frequency


Wi-Fi–enabled smart phones
Future devices that will be used with the wireless LAN must be evaluated. This includes 
the expansion of the wireless LAN, new technology that may be introduced based on the 
business model, and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) acceptance. See Chapter 4, “Wireless 
LAN Client Devices,” for more information regarding the various wireless client devices 
that are used with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking.

Wireless LAN Site Surveys
361
The Wireless LAN Environment
Understanding the environment in which the wireless LAN will be deployed and the wire-
less client devices that will be used in the environment is another important factor that 
sometimes is overlooked. Different environments will have different concerns. For example, 
an area that may have excess radio frequency noise, an area with harsh environmental 
conditions such as temperature ﬂ uctuations, or industrial areas have their own set of chal-
lenges. Different environments that may have their distinct type of challenges include:


General office spaces: Walls and attenuation values


Office cube farms: Density


Medical: Hospitals or medical centers


Industrial: Machine shops or factories


Educational: High quantity of mobile devices
These are a few examples or different environments that may use IEEE 802.11 wireless 
LANs and will need to be considered as part of the wireless LAN site survey. In Chapter 2, 
“Introduction to Wireless Local Area Networking,” you learned about some of the various 
deployment scenarios for common wireless LAN network types.
Performance Expectations
Keeping in mind that wireless networks are half-duplex and contention based, and many 
factors will affect the performance of a wireless LAN, including the number of wireless 
devices, types of software and hardware applications used, location, and the number of 
infrastructure devices providing access. These infrastructure devices include access points 
and bridges. Part of a wireless LAN site survey involves deﬁ ning what the customer expects 
for performance of the network. A mutual understanding of the factors that affect perfor-
mance as well as how they will be dealt with is imperative from the beginning of the wire-
less LAN site survey process.
Bring-Your-Own-Device Acceptance
With the number of IEEE 802.11–enabled devices continually growing, the need for 
increased wireless LAN capacity is also becoming a major concern. Bring your own device
(BYOD) describes the recent increase in company employees bringing their own personal 
IEEE 802.11–enabled mobile devices to their place of work and using these devices to 
access company resources including the Internet, printers, software applications, and ﬁ le 
servers. Take a moment and think about the number of IEEE 802.11–enabled devices you 
may have in your possession, ofﬁ ce or home. These devices include:


Notebook computers


Smart phones


Tablet devices


Wireless printers

Chapter 10  Wireless LAN Site Survey Basics


Wireless video cameras


Wireless household appliances


DVD or Blu-ray players


Wireless-capable televisions
This list represents just some of the devices that are used daily and are now IEEE 802.11 
wireless capable. The average family of four may have as many as 20 wireless LAN devices 
in the home, and this number will increase as wireless LAN technology advances. When 
companies or organizations allow employees to bring their personal wireless devices to the 
ofﬁ ce or place of work, that opens up an entire set of potential issues. These issues include 
security, technical support, and wireless infrastructure capacity concerns.
BYOD, Wireless LAN Capacity, and RF Site Surveys
If employees are allowed to bring their own devices to their place of business, you must 
take this into consideration when designing a wireless network and performing an RF 
site survey. Because IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs are contention based and use a shared 
medium, the added number of devices will impact the performance if the network is not 
properly designed. BYOD may require smaller RF cells and additional wireless access 
points in order to offer adequate performance for the number of devices. In addition to the 
load factor, the types of technology used—IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n—will have an impact on the 
need for backward compatibility. Figure 10.1 shows how a number of personal devices can 
have an impact on the capacity of a wireless LAN.

Gathering Business Requirements
363
Gathering Business Requirements
Gathering information is typically the ﬁ rst step of a wireless LAN design and implementa-
tion. As mentioned, the business model or type of business where the wireless LAN will 
be deployed is a major part of deciding the level of a wireless LAN site survey. The type 
of business will determine the needs and use of a wireless network. Knowing the applica-
tions used—both hardware and software—is a critical part of a wireless LAN deployment 
as this will affect recommendations such as the number and locations of access points. 
Expectations can make or break a wireless LAN deployment. The expectations of the wire-
less network must be discussed, evaluated, and documented up front. To completely under-
stand what the customer expects, you will need to gather information from various areas of 
the business. A high-quality site survey is going to require many questions to be asked and 
answered, including the following:
Bandwidth Needs  How much bandwidth will be required for users of the wireless net-
work? The types of applications in use will have an impact on this. Most manufacturers 
have wireless LAN design guides that you can reference for various deployment scenarios.
Coverage Area  In what rooms or areas of the buildings is wireless LAN coverage 
expected? This is becoming the entire location in most cases.
Applications Used  What type of applications—either hardware or software—are used at 
the facility? This may include computer-aided design, digital imaging, databases, and voice 
over wireless LAN.
Wireless Devices Used  What type of wireless devices will be used? These include note-
book computers, handheld scanners, wireless phones tablets, and other devices, whether 
company owned or BYOD.
Desired IEEE 802.11 Technologies  What type of IEEE 802.11 infrastructure (IEEE 
802.11a/b/g/n) would be best suited to the speciﬁ c environment and deployment?
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks were once considered extensions of wired networks, 
providing access to a few users in areas exceeding the physical distance of Ethernet or other 
wired medium in place. IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology continues to grow and is 
now a major part of every area in a business, corporation, or company’s computer network 
infrastructure. It is difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd any business or organization that does not provide some 
type of IEEE 802.11 wireless network access. Fully understanding the business require-
ments is part of a successful wireless LAN site survey and deployment. This section looks 
at case studies of designing for the wireless networking requirements of different types of 
businesses or other organizations.
General Office/Enterprise
Ofﬁ ce buildings and other enterprise installation locations may consist of walled ofﬁ ces or 
open spaces with many cubicles. This type of installation usually will require infrastructure 
devices to aesthetically ﬁ t the environment and may require antennas to be mounted to 

364

drop ceilings with the access points located out of sight. Figure 10.2 shows an example of a 
ﬂ oor plan for an ofﬁ ce deployment.
F I G U R E  10 . 2   A small office wireless LAN installation using omnidirectional 
antennas
These installations may have a high density of users and therefore require more access 
points to handle the number of wireless devices connected to the network. The software 
and hardware applications used in these environments will need to be closely evaluated to 
ensure optimal performance for the user base. Chances are that interference sources in this 
type of deployment would be limited mostly to computer networking, and radio frequency 
challenges may be limited.

Manufacturing
Deploying a wireless network in a manufacturing environment will not be as straightfor-
ward as general ofﬁ ce/enterprise or some other deployment types. Manufacturing environ-
ments have a completely different set of challenges, including equipment other than IEEE 
802.11 devices that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, which means RF interference can be 
a major issue.
In addition to interference, physical aspects of the structure itself such as high ceilings 
and large manufacturing facilities create mounting, accessibility, and RF signal concerns. 
Equipment installed in manufacturing facilities may have to withstand harsh environmental 
conditions such as extreme temperature, grease, and dirt.

Warehousing
Warehousing presents unique challenges for wireless networking. Like manufacturing 
environments, warehouses are typically large facilities with high ceilings, making for a 
potentially difﬁ cult site survey and installation. In addition, one of the biggest concerns with 
warehousing deployments is the storage of products and materials. Certain types of product 
in large quantities, such as paint and other liquids, can cause excessive RF behaviors such as 
refraction, absorption, and reﬂ ection, thereby affecting performance of the wireless network. 
Liquids, especially stored in large quantities, will have an absorbing effect on RF. Other prod-
ucts, such as those made of paper or cardboard, will also have an impact. These issues should 
be evaluated closely as part of the site survey process for a warehouse implementation. As the 
inventories for these products change, so will the effect of the RF behaviors.

Retail/Point of Sale
Retail and point-of-sale (PoS) deployments may have some characteristics similar to those 
of the warehousing environment. In addition to a large quantity of products such as paper 
and liquids, there may be RF interference sources in businesses that sell appliances and 
electronics. The use or demonstration of items such as microwave ovens, two-way radios, 
consumer-grade IEEE 802.11 access points, and computers may cause interference issues 
that need to be evaluated. 
Security is another major concern for this type of business in order to protect informa-
tion such as credit card numbers and personal identiﬁ cation numbers (PINs). Some major 
retailers are now using the wireless network to broadcast or announce in-store specials to 
patrons visiting the store; they can do this using a variety of mechanisms, including text 
messages or email. The personal devices that many people have in their possession may also 
have an effect on interference.
Healthcare/Medical
Healthcare deployments such as hospitals can be a challenging installation for many rea-
sons. These environments will have both wireless LAN and wired LAN devices that oper-
ate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band; therefore interference may be a critical factor for both the 
WLAN deployment and the other medical devices that use the same frequencies. Some 
areas in hospitals—such as the intensive care unit, emergency room, or operating rooms—
may have limitations on the type of wireless that may be installed, whereas others may 
require coverage throughout the entire hospital.
IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology has greatly improved the way hospitals function 
by allowing doctors, nurses, and lab technicians to use notebook computers as well as other 
portable devices including IEEE 802.11–capable tablets while working with patients and 
staff members. In addition to aiding the hospital infrastructure, wireless LANs are used by 
patients and visitors quite extensively. This gives patients recovering at a hospital and their 
visitors the capability to use the Internet to access information. Once again the number of 
personal wireless-enabled devices may have an impact on the wireless LAN installed.

Government/Military
Government agencies and military installations need to be taken into consideration for 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. One of the biggest concerns for wireless LAN deploy-
ments in these environments is security. Some government or military agencies do not allow 
any wireless LAN access and have what is known as a “No Wi-Fi” policy. In a situation 
like this, a site survey is still required because the wireless LAN deployment, instead of 
allowing access to network resources, will be used to monitor the air and to keep all unau-
thorized wireless access out.
For government and military agencies that do allow wireless access to resources and the 
Internet, security is of the utmost concern. Government and military installations may span 
large campuses similar to those in educational deployments such as universities and may

Education
Education deployments will vary in size and complexity. Some of the factors that play a role 
in educational IEEE 802.11 wireless deployments include density and coverage. For exam-
ple, a large university campus may have tens of thousands of students and thousands of 
access points covering many acres of land and many buildings. As mentioned in Chapter 2, 

Gathering Business Requirements

some educational institutions are implementing a “one-to-one” initiative—in other words, 
the goal is to have one Internet-accessible device for every one student. This type of initia-
tive will introduce density and capacity concerns, because of the potentially high number 
of students in a single classroom. Educational institutions, whether an elementary school, a 
high school, or a college campus, should always consider starting with an RF wireless site 
survey and follow best practices from the equipment manufacturer to ensure a successful 
deployment.

Public Access, Hotspots, Hospitality
Public access, hotspots, and hospitality IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN installations may need 
to accept connections from a wide variety of client devices, including IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n 
devices. In many cases, consumer-brand notebook computers will be limited to IEEE 
802.11b/g or now 802.11b/g/n technology. Backward compatibility with these technologies 
is essential because the infrastructure will have no control over the type of client device 
that may connect. If backward compatibility is not taken into consideration, some devices 
may not be able to connect and use the wireless network resources.
Although many wireless LAN deployments should take these factors into consideration, 
it is especially important in environments in which the infrastructure has little or no con-
trol over the client device population that may be connecting to the wireless LAN. This 
type of network includes public access installations such as hotels or resorts, restaurants, 
airports, arenas, and other small to large service businesses.

Interviewing Stakeholders
Understanding the intended use of an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN is a critical part of a suc-
cessful deployment. Who better to explain what the wireless network will be used for than 
those who will be using it? Those performing a site survey may not necessarily understand 
the functional aspects of a certain type of business, so it is critical to get input from all who 
will be using the wireless network. Department managers, business unit managers, and 
team leaders usually know the function of their speciﬁ c areas of the organization the best. 
Therefore they will also know the needs and requirements of users of the wireless network 
and how a successful deployment will help increase job productivity.
I recommend you create some type of checklist or formal site survey questionnaire to 
use during the interview process. This will ensure speciﬁ c details about the business and 
proposed wireless deployment are not missed. The use of such forms helps ensure uniform, 
repeatable interviews. These forms can also become part of the documentation and ﬁ nal 
deliverable that will be presented to the customer. Although there are some general questions 
that can be asked, there will be more speciﬁ c questions based on the business model of the 
organization or the wireless LAN to be installed. Figure 10.3 shows an example of notes that 
can be taken during the information gathering stage and the wireless site survey speciﬁ cs.

LAN site survey

374
Chapter 10  Wireless LAN Site Survey Basics
Some generic interview questions that will pertain to most installations are as follows:
Has a site survey ever been performed in the past?  It is good to know whether a site sur-
vey has previously been performed at a location. Although the previous site survey is only 
as good as the person who performed it, it may be beneﬁ cial and a timesaver to have some 
information available. Depending on when it was performed, a previous site survey report 
may not be accurate—physical changes to the location may have taken place—for example, 
additions of rooms or walls or changes to the interior design.
Are any blueprints, floor plans, or any other site-specific documentation avail-
able?  Blueprints, ﬂ oor plans, or other documentation about the location are critical in 
performing an RF wireless site survey. If this information is not available it may have to be 
created, which in turn would create an additional expense for the company or customer. The 
accuracy of these documents needs to be considered in order to provide ideal site survey results.
How many devices and users anticipate using the wireless network?  The number of 
expected devices on the wireless network is valuable information to have. Knowing the 
number of devices and users will help determine the amount of infrastructure equipment, 
such as access points and bridges, that will be required for the deployment. Discussing with 
department managers the number of devices and users on the network as well as the num-
ber of working shifts will help provide adequate planning. Also knowing whether users are 
allowed to bring their own devices will be beneﬁ cial.
Will public access be required?  If public access to the wireless network is required, that 
will potentially affect the number of infrastructure devices such as access points required 
for the deployment. In addition to the equipment, security, captive portal and backward 
compatibility should be taken into account in this situation.
Is there any preference for a specific manufacturer’s equipment?  It is a recommended practice 
for a site survey to be performed with the same manufacturer’s equipment that will be used in 
the deployment. So any customer preference for equipment manufacturer must be determined 
at the initial phases of the site survey. This will ensure good results based on the design of the 
wireless network.
What is the coverage area?  The intended coverage area of the facility also needs to be 
addressed. This helps provide a surveyor with information to accurately estimate how long 
a physical site survey may take and roughly estimate the amount of hardware required. 
Knowing the coverage area will also help determine any unexpected obstacles that may 
occur as part of the site survey process.
Is an existing IEEE 802.11 wireless network in place?  If an existing IEEE 802.11 wireless 
network is in place, it needs to be addressed as part of the site survey process. Questions 
need to be asked, such as:


What technology is currently in use, IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b/g, or IEEE 
802.11n?


How many wireless devices and users does the network currently support?


Where are the access points located?


What is the wireless network used for?

Interviewing Stakeholders
375
Knowing the answers to these and other questions will help determine the role, if any, that 
the existing IEEE 802.11 wireless network will play in the new deployment. Keep in mind 
that some organizations may have quite an extensive existing wireless network and may be 
in the process of upgrading to newer or different technology. If this is the case, it will need 
to be determined whether any of the existing network components can or will be used with 
the new deployment. Photographs of existing equipment used in a deployment are always 
useful. Figure 10.4 shows a photograph of an existing IEEE 802.11a/b/g access point with 
diversity antennas.

Are there any known areas of RF interference?  Information regarding known areas of 
RF interference is very useful in a site survey. It will save time if previous knowledge of RF 
interference is made available as part of the site survey process.
Are there any known areas that may lack RF coverage?  Just as previous knowledge of 
areas affected by RF interference is valuable, the lack of RF coverage in speciﬁ c areas is 
also very good to know. This will help a surveyor determine any special situations that may 
be addressed during the site survey process. This may require testing of various types of 
antennas to help provide RF coverage in areas that are currently lacking.
What type of applications will be used?  It is important to know the types of applica-
tions that will be used. Applications—either software or hardware—will affect the load 
and number of access points or other infrastructure devices required. These applications 
include bandwidth-intensive software, voice over wireless, and so on. The surveyor should 
also become familiar with any special circumstances that may be required to support these 
applications—for example, the frequency or IEEE 802.11 technology that may be required 
for the wireless devices to operate.

376
Chapter 10  Wireless LAN Site Survey Basics
Will voice or other applications that require quality of service be used?  If applications 
(such as voice handsets) are planned for the location, this will have an impact on the site 
survey and design of the wireless network. Because these types of applications have greater 
requirements for signal quality and signal strength as well as fast transition, this will need 
to be taken into consideration during the site survey. Additional density and more access 
points may be required.
Video over wireless LAN is another application that may require quality of service. Like 
voice, video is subject to latency and may involve special design requirements. Video over 
wireless LAN is used in applications ranging from sports venues to security surveillance 
and monitoring.
Is roaming required?  In most cases, the answer to this question is yes. This is especially 
true with networks that will be using voice handsets. Voice handsets are one of the most 
commonly used wireless LAN devices that require seamless roaming and secure transition 
capabilities. Although notebook computers and tablets may require roaming, voice and 
video applications are time bounded and subject to latency issues. Fast, secure transitions 
may also be required for roaming. If so, the amount of overlap between RF cells would need 
to be closely looked at to ensure reliable sessions for the devices connected to the network.
Is Power over Ethernet (PoE) required?  In most medium to large installations, the answer 
to this question is yes. Understanding the PoE requirements is another essential part of the 
wireless LAN site survey. The capabilities as well as the number of devices expected to use 
PoE—including wireless access point, hardwired Ethernet IP phones, and security cam-
eras—will play a role in the design and types of equipment used in the wireless network.
What are the wireless security requirements?  Although security is not necessarily part of 
an RF site survey, as much information as possible on the security requirements is very help-
ful with the design of the wireless network. Some security solutions may require additional 
hardware or software that would have to be taken into account for the network design.
Will an escort be required?  In many cases, people are not allowed to roam freely through-
out a business. An escort might be and usually is needed to walk through a location with 
an outside contract site surveyor. In addition, the escort and surveyor will need access to 
areas that may be locked or secure, such as wiring closets and computer rooms. Escorts 
may be from various parts of the company, hospital, or organization, including facilities, 
information technology, medical staff, and security.
Are there any legislative compliance requirements?  Depending on the type of business in 
which the wireless network will be installed, there may be legislative or other compliance 
requirements. For example, medical institutions may have to meet HIPAA requirements, 
and retail establishments may require PCI compliance. These need to be taken into consid-
eration as part of a wireless LAN site survey and deployment. 
Are you following corporate policies?  You should use any written corporate policy as 
a guideline or offer suggestions for changes in the policy to accommodate other wireless 
LAN requirements. The wireless LAN site survey questioning process should bring any 
policy-related issues to light for discussion and/or change if needed.

Manufacturer Guidelines and Deployment Guides
The information just presented includes some types of questions that need to be addressed 
during the site survey process. Keep in mind that the actual questions and details depend 
on the business model and the implementation of the wireless network. For site survey and 
deployment guides, check with the manufacturer of the equipment that you will use. These 
guides will provide additional information that is helpful in generating a list of questions 
and concerns that will need to be addressed.
A sample sensor placement site survey form can be found on the 
download page for this book, www.sybex.com/go/cwts2e.
Defining Physical and Data Security 
Requirements
Understanding the security requirements of both the physical environment and the user 
data is another design aspect of a wireless network. Because wireless LANs use radio 
frequency to send and receive information such as computer data, wireless LANs are 
vulnerable to something known as RF jamming, which is caused by RF interference and 
can be either intentional or unintentional. As the name implies, RF jamming disrupts RF 
communications. If an intruder wants to wreak havoc in a wireless network, they can 
use an RF signal jammer to cause interference on the same RF bands used by the wire-
less network. The only way to protect against this kind of activity is through physical 
security. Physical security includes blocking RF signals from either entering or leaving 
a location. This could be done in a variety of ways—shielding materials can include 
metal, paint, or even wallpaper. If physical security is a concern where the wireless net-
work will be installed, this needs to be taken into consideration during a site survey and 
design stages.
For reasons beyond their control, some organizations may still require the use of legacy 
IEEE 802.11 security solutions for data security—ensuring that information such as com-
puter data is received by the intended recipients without tampering during transit. This may 
include legacy hardware or software devices that have limited security capabilities. If legacy 
security solutions are used, special considerations may need to be taken into account from 
an infrastructure design perspective. This could mean using more access points or poten-
tially using virtual local area network (VLAN) technology, which involves deﬁ ning broad-
cast domains in a Layer 2 network. Other, more advanced security solutions may require 
additional hardware or software for both the infrastructure and devices accessing the 
network. It is important to understand that wireless LAN deployments should never violate 
or circumvent a corporate security policy. Security solutions were discussed in Chapter 9, 
“Wireless LAN Security Basics.”

Gathering Site-Specific Documentation

Floor Plans and Blueprints
Gathering any site-speciﬁ c documentation that exists, such as ﬂ oor plans or blueprints, is 
helpful for a site survey. This documentation is useful to a variety of individuals who will 
be participating in a wireless LAN design and deployment. The documentation can be used 
during a physical or predictive RF site survey and spectrum analysis to note areas of impor-
tance. Having ﬂ oor plans and blueprints available allows a surveyor to document speciﬁ c 
parts of a site survey such as location of access points and other wireless devices. If a pre-
dictive modeling site survey is used, an electronic version of a ﬂ oor plan can be imported 
into the software program to help streamline the surveyor’s job. The standard formats for 
ﬂ oor plan (map) ﬁ les vary from product to product for most modeling software, but they 
typically include DWG, PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, and TIF. Figure 10.5 shows a site survey 
software program that allows for various ﬁ le formats to be imported.
Blueprints or ﬂ oor plans will also help those who install cable and mount hardware and 
if necessary can be provided to electricians for AC power installation.
Furnishings
The proposed types and location of furnishings or other items that may affect RF signal 
propagation or penetration are also good to know if the information is available. This will 
help during the design and site survey phase to determine access point locations and pin-
point other things that may affect RF signals, such as reﬂ ection, refraction, diffraction, and 
absorption. Unfortunately, most ﬂ oor plan documents do not specify this kind of informa-
tion, because in many cases furnishings are not permanent ﬁ xtures and can change. Some 
organizations will have this information stored in asset documentation using spreadsheets 
or databases. Many times it will be up to the surveyor to determine where the furnishings or 
equipment are located and the effect it may have on the radio frequency. 
Be sure to gather information about the following:



In medical environments, furnishings or equipment will include devices that may cause 
interference and operate in the same frequency range as the proposed wireless network. 
Storage of items used within the hospital or medical environment for patients and 
employees may also affect RF coverage.

In educational environments, the location of lockers and internal windows are impor-
tant, as are the types of materials used in the walls, such as concrete blocks with 
and/or without sound dampening material inside. All of these factors will have an 
effect on the RF propagation.
These are just some examples of the types of furnishings and other items that may affect 
a wireless LAN deployment and are factors to consider.

Electrical Specifications
Documentation of the electrical speciﬁ cations of the environment is helpful in determin-
ing whether the current electrical implementation will be sufﬁ cient to handle the proposed 
wireless network deployment. This will allow the site survey process to determine whether 
any upgrades need to be made in order to support devices that may be using Power over 
Ethernet or if the existing infrastructure is sufﬁ cient. It is best to gather information 
regarding electrical power sources, electrical panel information, existing wiring, and loca-
tion of electrical outlets.

Documenting Existing Network Characteristics
Documentation is a major part of any business, and computer networks are no exception. 
In order to have a successful deployment of a wireless network, it is critical to know the 
details of the existing network infrastructure as well as future implementations, upgrades, 
and modiﬁ cations. These existing infrastructures may include a wired or wireless network 
already in place and functioning that may be upgraded or in a new deployment. Figure 10.6 
shows a ﬂ oor plan with an existing wireless deployment of only two access points provid-
ing wireless access for the conference rooms. This information can be used as part of the 
new wireless site survey and design.
Documentation of networks is usually the responsibility of the IT department. Some 
organizations may lack good documentation of the existing network infrastructure. If this 
is the case, additional work may be required prior to starting a wireless site survey.
Existing IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks  One of the questions that must be asked during 
the interview process is to determine the scope of any existing IEEE 802.11 wireless net-
works. If this type of wireless network does exist (as it often does), it will need to be dealt 
with during the site survey and design procedure. The questions that are asked regarding 
the existing wireless network will help determine the role it is going to play. If the existing 
network is going to remain in place, understanding its technical details and how to work 
it into the design of the new or upgraded deployment will help you create a successful and 
productive wireless LAN deployment.
Existing IEEE 802.3 or Other Wired Networks  In addition to knowing of any existing 
wireless networks, you should know about the wired network infrastructure. Any existing 
documentation on the wired network infrastructure will help streamline the process for 
connecting the IEEE 802.11 wireless components of the network. The wired infrastructure 
is discussed in more detail in the next section of this chapter.
Identifying Infrastructure Connectivity 
and Power Requirements
Why are there so many wires in wireless networking? Wireless networks require some type 
of wired infrastructure for many reasons, including connecting access points together, 
allowing wireless device and user access to network resources, providing access to a wide 
area network, allowing Internet connectivity, and supplying electrical power.
Network infrastructure connectivity plays a big role in wireless networking. A wireless 
LAN site survey will require additional information about the network infrastructure and 
power requirements. In a sense, a wireless site survey also requires a wired or infrastruc-
ture survey. Information regarding the wired network includes:

Electrical power requirements
Location of Wiring Closets  A wiring closet is a room (usually secured) containing electri-
cal power and cabling for voice and data that is terminated and connected to infrastructure 
devices such as switches and routers. In most cases these locations are noted on the ﬂ oor 
plan or blueprint documents, but that may not always be the case and you will need to 
ﬁ nd them if they are not noted. When deploying a wireless network, you should know not 
only the physical locations of wiring closets but also the capacity of existing infrastructure 
devices. This is important because wired connections such as IEEE 802.3 Ethernet have 
speciﬁ c limits for cable lengths, and infrastructure devices such as access points and bridges 
will have to be placed within these physical limits of infrastructure connectivity. For exam-
ple, the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard has a physical maximum cable length of 328 feet (or 
100 meters) for unshielded twisted pair wiring.
In addition to cable length, the feasibility of running the Ethernet cable from the wiring 
closet to the desired location must be considered. For example, the intended location for an 
access point may be on a ceiling without any access from above. In this case, lack of acces-
sibility could pose a problem for installation of the Ethernet cabling from the wiring closet 
and/or AC power to the devices.
Wired Infrastructure Network Devices in Use  The wired infrastructure devices in use 
may have an impact on a successful deployment of a wireless LAN. An evaluation of the 
infrastructure devices by a WLAN site surveyor or a network infrastructure professional 
may be required to determine if any additional hardware or changes must be made prior to 
deploying a WLAN. If the infrastructure devices, such as Layer 2 switches and routers, are 
not adequate to support a new wireless deployment, additional hardware may need to be 
purchased.
Connection Speed between Sites  The connection speeds and type of connections between 
sites should be evaluated to determine any bottlenecks that could affect the overall network 
performance. Placement of authentication servers and other network resources may be 
affected by the speed of these links.
Electrical Power  Since all wireless LAN infrastructure devices, including access points, 
bridges, and wireless switches, require an AC power source, and these devices may be sup-
plying Power over Ethernet (PoE) to the infrastructure devices, veriﬁ cation of an adequate 
AC power supply must be performed. The AC power sources are sometimes taken for 
granted or not taken into consideration, which could pose a problem during the installation 
phase. It is also important to determine what local ordinances may apply and what they 
allow you to do for a wireless LAN installation.
Because PoE is used not only in infrastructure devices but also with IP telephones, 
security cameras, and other users’ devices, it may be necessary to perform calculations 
and verify that the power supply to the wiring closet will be adequate to support the 
powered infrastructure (including the PoE devices). Electrical components of a wiring

closet may need to be upgraded to support a new wireless LAN deployment. Newer 
wireless LAN technologies such as IEEE 802.11n MIMO systems may require more DC 
power than is currently available with IEEE 802.3af PoE, based on this amendment to 
the Ethernet standard. 
If these technologies will be used, the power requirements will need to be carefully con-
sidered to verify that enough DC power will be available to the end powered devices. 
Some manufacturers provide IEEE 802.3at (with new PoE capabilities) endpoint or 
midspan devices to provide the necessary amount of DC voltage for certain PoE-capable 
devices. All manufacturers of IEEE 802.11 wireless equipment claim the capability to 
power newer dual-band IEEE 802.11n access points with standard 802.3af power. I rec-
ommend that you read the specification data sheet for the access point or other wireless 
device to determine the type of PoE required and if IEEE 802.3af or IEEE 802.3at will be 
required for the device.
Understanding Application 
Requirements
Understanding the application requirements for software applications is another important 
part of a successful wireless LAN deployment. The types and number of applications used 
will affect the performance and the capacity of an IEEE 802.11 WLAN. Some software 
applications are very bandwidth intensive and will require more resources to perform effec-
tively as designed. Examples of these applications include computer-aided design (CAD) 
and database programs. By contrast, other applications, such as checking email or casual 
Internet browsing, are not bandwidth intensive.
Application Effects on Wireless LAN Capacity
As mentioned earlier, some types of software that an organization may use, such as CAD 
and database applications, will have a tremendous effect on the performance of a wireless 
LAN. These applications require special attention when designing a wireless LAN because 
the acceptable capacity of the access points will be less than other applications that do not 
require as many resources, such as email programs or working with word processors. The 
infrastructure resources that will be impacted include the processing power and memory 
capacity of the wireless access points and the speed of the wired infrastructure itself, such 
as 100 Mbps or 1000 Mbps (Gigabit). 
This in turn will affect the RF site survey. The wireless LAN site survey will be impacted 
because the location where the WLAN is installed may require more infrastructure devices 
or access points. Other applications, such as voice over wireless LAN, may introduce 
another entire set of issues. This type of deployment may use only the 5 GHz band for wire-
less voice technology, and therefore the wireless site survey must be performed accordingly.

Chapter 10  Wireless LAN Site Survey Basics
Understanding RF Coverage and 
Capacity Requirements
A major aspect of a wireless LAN site survey is to understand and verify the RF cov-
erage and capacity requirements based on the network design. In Chapter 6, “Radio 
Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless LAN Technology,” you learned about coverage 
versus capacity and the differences between them. A WLAN site surveyor will need to 
verify these requirements as part of the site survey. This can be accomplished either 
manually or automatically through a predictive process, both to be discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 11.
To review, the wireless coverage and capacity requirements are going to depend on sev-
eral factors such as:


Physical size of the area to be covered


Number of users or devices accessing the wireless network, including bring your own 
device (BYOD)


Software or hardware applications in use


Obstacles and propagation factors based on the environment


Radio frequency range of the network to be installed


Wireless LAN hardware to be used


Output RF power of the transmitters


Receive sensitivity of the receivers
In addition to an RF coverage analysis, an RF spectrum analysis will be beneficial. 
An RF spectrum analysis allows a site surveyor to view areas of RF coverage as well 
as interference sources and non-IEEE 802.11 wireless devices. This topic will be dis-
cussed further in Chapter 11. Although a spectrum analysis is not required, it does 
allow a site surveyor to view sources of RF in the locations where a wireless LAN will 
be deployed.
The following sections, “Client Connectivity Requirements” and 
“Antenna Use Considerations,” cover topics not included in the CWTS 
exam objectives but are valuable information. This information is 
included here for your own reference.

Client Connectivity Requirements
385
Client Connectivity Requirements
Client devices that will be connecting to the wireless LAN also need to be considered as 
part of a site survey. This includes knowing the radio type, antenna type, gain, orientation, 
portability, and mobility of the device. Keep in mind that a wireless client device is both a 
radio frequency transmitter and a receiver. The client must be able to hear the access point 
and the access point must be able to hear the client device. The RF cell size will vary from 
device to device. It is beneﬁ cial to survey with the type of devices that will be used with 
the wireless LAN whenever possible. Understanding the type and function of client devices 
will have an impact on the design of the wireless network. Common wireless client devices 
include:


Notebook computers


Tablets


Pocket computers


Smart phones


Barcode scanners


Point-of-sale devices


Voice handsets
Other wireless devices used in various wireless LAN applications include but are not 
limited to:


Desktop computers


Printers and print servers


Manufacturing equipment


Video cameras
Many environments have both desktop and notebook computers as wireless client 
devices. These devices may or may not require roaming capability. Ofﬁ ce and enterprise 
deployments commonly use handsets for voice communications. Although it is fairly 
difﬁ cult to take all potential wireless client devices into consideration, it is best to under-
stand the type of devices that will be used. This information can be obtained through the 
interview process and the gathering information stage of the site survey. Figure 10.7 shows 
various wireless client devices.

Antenna Use Considerations
In Chapter 7, “Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories,” you saw various types of anten-
nas and accessories. The antenna used in any deployment will depend on the speciﬁ c 
scenario. As part of the site survey, various antenna types may need to be used for testing 
purposes to determine the best antenna for a speciﬁ c application. In some cases, the cus-
tomer may want a speciﬁ c type of antenna, such as omnidirectional mounted directly to the 
access points. Others may be using access points without external antenna capabilities. 
Some businesses are concerned about aesthetics and are particular about the appearance 
of an antenna and the mounting location. The proper antenna selection will ensure correct 
coverage as intended by the design and site survey of the wireless LAN. The antenna type 
used will determine the propagation pattern of the radio frequency and is a signiﬁ cant part 
of a successful wireless LAN deployment. The antenna used in various deployments will 
depend on the business model in which the network is installed. Listed are some examples 
of the business models discussed earlier in this chapter and the type of antennas that may 
be used in these implementations:

Antenna Use Considerations 
387
General Office/Enterprise  General ofﬁ ce/enterprise solutions usually require complete 
coverage throughout the entire location. In many cases, this type of installation will require 
access points mounted out of sight and aesthetically pleasing antennas. This could be an 
omnidirectional antenna mounted to a ceiling tile or integrated within an access point.
Manufacturing  Manufacturing environments are usually industrial facilities with high 
ceilings and various types of manufacturing and industrial equipment. These environments 
may use a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antennas due to the physical 
architecture of the buildings. The antennas also may need to withstand harsh environmen-
tal conditions such as extreme temperature ﬂ uctuations and dirt.
Warehousing  Warehousing implementations have some characteristics in common with 
manufacturing. The buildings that house this type of business are in many cases large open 
areas with high ceilings allowing the storage of large volumes of product and equipment. 
Antenna mounting needs to be looked at very closely to ensure that equipment such as 
forklifts used to move product do not come in contact and damage antennas. Warehousing 
also may use a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antennas for proper 
coverage. Figure 10.8 shows a sample ﬂ oor plan for a combination small ofﬁ ce/warehouse 
deployment using a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antennas.
F I G U R E  10 . 8   Small office/warehouse floor plan showing RF coverage using 
different antenna types
Retail/Point of Sale (PoS)  Retail/point-of-sale installations may have to accommodate pub-
licly accessible areas as well as warehousing and storage in the back of the buildings. In this 
type of installation, antennas will be a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional. 
The devices may consist of computers as well as other handhelds such as wireless barcode 
scanners or portable wireless devices. Appropriate antenna selection and gain need to be 
considered to ensure the devices have good signal connectivity to the infrastructure. In many 
cases, the public areas will require aesthetics to be taken into account in antenna selection. 
In the storage part of the building, antennas are similar to those described in warehousing.

388
Chapter 10  Wireless LAN Site Survey Basics
Healthcare and Medical  Many healthcare and medical deployments are publicly acces-
sible, so aesthetics and security are both important. Antenna types that ﬁ t the environment 
and are not accessible to the public are commonly used. Some healthcare facilities, such as 
hospitals, may require the use of only omnidirectional antennas mounted to the autono-
mous access point or integrated into an access point. Others may allow semidirectional 
antennas such as Yagis to cover long hallways and corridors.
Government and Military  Government and military wireless environments are usually 
not publicly accessible and in many cases are campus based and require outdoor solutions 
as well as indoor. In these installations, antennas mounted directly to an access point or 
semidirectional antennas may well ﬁ t the environment. For outdoor point-to-point or 
point-to-multipoint, highly directional antennas such as parabolic dish may be required.
Education  Education deployments are typically campus based and may require the use 
of outdoor antennas to connect buildings together. However, for indoor solutions, ensur-
ing the antennas will ﬁ t the environment and not be tampered with needs to be evaluated. 
These deployments may use a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antenna 
types. Some locations may require the use of enclosures for the infrastructure devices to 
ensure security of the physical devices. In these cases, special connectors and antenna 
adapters may be required.
Public Access, Hotspot, and Hospitality  Public access, hotspot, and hospitality sites are 
publicly accessible locations that will require aesthetics and security when it comes to 
antenna selection, as with some of the previous examples. These deployments can use a 
combination of omnidirectional, semidirectional, and highly directional antennas.
Typical Steps Used in a Wireless LAN Site Survey
Listed here are some basic steps to provide an overview of the wireless LAN site 
survey process. Keep in mind these steps may vary slightly based on the location 
and the type of wireless LAN deployment.
1. Gathering Information and Discussing Business Requirements  Determine the need 
and intended use of the wireless LAN and interview appropriate individuals. Explain the 
site survey process and provide an overview of wireless networking. Doing so will help 
minimize unnecessary delays caused by people who are not included in the process 
but should have been and are unaware of the wireless LAN and site survey.
2. Project Timeline and Planning  Understand and document the extent and estimated 
timeline of the survey process and deployment. This will include all stages of the 
wireless site survey from start to ﬁ nish, such as design, deployment, and veriﬁ ca-
tion. Because the wireless site survey may include people from many different areas 
such as facilities, IT, engineering, and so on, everyone must be on the same track.

Antenna Use Considerations
389
3. Site Visit and Predesign Audit  It is a good idea to make a visit to the location in 
order to get an idea of any issues that may not be visible on a blueprint or ﬂ oor 
plan. This will also allow for checking the RF propagation with a test access point 
if feasible. Performing a wireless LAN site survey without a site visit—especially 
a predictive modeling survey—can be done, but that will come with some risks. 
Knowing what you are dealing with will minimize mistakes caused by not knowing 
the environment and therefore possibly making inaccurate assumptions. 
4. Wireless LAN Design  Determine areas of RF coverage and interference as well 
as potential placement of access points and other infrastructure devices. This will 
be done with an onsite manual site survey, a predictive modeling site survey, or a 
combination of both. An RF spectrum analyzer can be used to view the air to deter-
mine the areas of RF interference.
5. RF Spectrum Analysis and RF Testing  Perform testing of the proposed design 
and verify RF sources of interference. Also verify coverage and lack of coverage. 
Although an RF spectrum analysis is not a required part of the wireless LAN site 
survey process, it is highly recommended. Knowing the potential RF interference 
may impact the wireless LAN design as a whole. It will be much easier to deal 
with potential RF issues up front rather than after the wireless LAN is deployed. 
Testing speciﬁ c areas or audit points with an access point will allow the surveyor to 
determine the coverage and how the RF propagates from the access point.
6. Deployment of Infrastructure Devices  Install the infrastructure devices as 
described by the design. This may or may not be done by the same person 
who performed the wireless site survey and in many cases it is not. This means 
that clear, concise documentation and instructions must be provided to the installer. 
This will reduce the risk of having to make unnecessary visits back to the location 
for corrections or adjustments because of mistakes that could have been avoided.
7. Verification of RF Coverage  Perform veriﬁ cation testing and spot checks of RF 
coverage per the design. Make necessary adjustments based on the results of RF 
testing. Veriﬁ cation testing may consist of spot checks in key areas (audit points) or 
could include the entire facility. It is important to be certain the wireless LAN will 
operate as designed. Sometimes cost or budget may not allow for a veriﬁ cation of 
the entire location, but I recommend it whenever possible. If the entire area can-
not be checked, determining the audit points should be done carefully and should 
be completed in the early stages of the site survey. If needed, make adjustments to 
allow the wireless LAN to operate as designed.
8. Support  Provide technical support for wireless LAN deployment. This involves 
maintaining the wireless LAN infrastructure and includes RF spectrum monitoring 
and making the necessary adjustments to adapt to the dynamics of environment. 
This can be done manually or automatically, depending on the capabilities of the 
IEEE 802.11 technology that is deployed.

Chapter 10  Wireless LAN Site Survey Basics
Summary
In this chapter, we explored the business aspects of wireless LAN site surveys. We looked at 
the objective of a site survey, which is to ﬁ nd areas of RF coverage, interference, and hard-
ware installation locations. We considered the factors determining the complexity of a site 
survey. These factors include:


Size of physical location


Intended use of network


Number of users and devices


Performance expectations


Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) acceptance
In this chapter you saw the importance of gathering information as well as the types of 
information required to successfully perform a wireless LAN site survey and the design of a 
wireless network. We looked at several examples of deployment scenarios and case studies 
from different manufacturers of wireless LAN equipment as to the beneﬁ ts and solutions of 
a wireless LAN deployment, which is the result of a successful site survey.
Anyone designing a wireless LAN needs to understand completely the expectations of 
how the network will perform in the environment before deploying the network. These 
expectations will be met by asking the right questions of the right people—managers and 
users of the wireless network—since they are the ones who will be using it. We explored the 
types of questions that may be asked to provide information that will allow for a successful 
wireless LAN site survey and deployment.
We also discussed taking into consideration the physical and data security requirements 
of the wireless network. This is part of a site survey because it will have an impact on the 
ﬁ nal design, including the number of access points and the physical and data security solu-
tions. Having the appropriate documentation is a key element to a successful deployment. 
If documents such as ﬂ oor plans and blueprints are not available, they may need to be cre-
ated as part of the site survey and design process and may require additional cost for the 
customer. Accurate documentation will also help streamline some of the site survey process 
and deployment of a wireless LAN hardware. Accurate documentation will help with the 
installation of cabling and access points and minimize questions about the installation.
It is essential to know the location and type of existing networks, both wired and wire-
less. If existing wireless networks are in place, you must determine what role, if any, they 
will play in the new deployment or upgrade. Identifying the location of wiring closets and 
evaluating power requirements are two other important tasks in a site survey.
In this chapter you learned about RF coverage requirements and the factors to be taken 
into consideration to ensure proper coverage throughout the location where the wireless 
network is installed. Finally, client connectivity requirements and other considerations were

391
discussed. The types of wireless client devices that will be used, such as notebook com-
puter, tablet, or barcode scanner, must be evaluated. Antenna orientation to ensure correct 
polarization will need to be considered during the site survey process. We also looked at the 
type of antennas commonly used in a particular deployment scenario.

This is the second of two chapters on the subject of wireless 
LAN site surveys.
In Chapter 10, “Wireless LAN Site Survey Basics,” you 
learned about the business aspects of a site survey, which included gathering of informa-
tion such as the business requirements for the wireless network, interviewing managers 
and users, and gathering site-speciﬁ c documentation. It is important to have all the neces-
sary groundwork prior to starting a physical wireless RF site survey. Having all the correct 
information in hand will allow for a complete and thorough survey, which in turn will 
result in a successful wireless LAN deployment.
In this chapter, you will see some of the components of performing an RF wireless LAN 
site survey, including determining areas of RF interference by using a spectrum analyzer. 
Taking into consideration both Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi interference sources and understand-
ing how this interference will affect the deployment are also important parts of performing 
a site survey. We will also look at different types of site surveys, both manual and predic-
tive modeling. We will discuss the two types of manual site surveys, passive and active, and 
show the advantages and disadvantages of both. Understanding the steps involved and the 
details of each site survey type will help a wireless LAN engineer determine the best meth-
odology to use. You will learn about some of the tools that may be used in a site survey, 
including wireless protocol analyzers and wireless scanners. Finally, we will look at the two 
different types of channel architecture and best practices for hardware placement, including 
access points and antennas, as well as some of the limitations you may encounter during 
the physical site survey process.
The Physical Radio Frequency Site 
Survey Process
After all the up-front work is completed, such as gathering of information, including the 
business requirements and site-speciﬁ c documentation, deﬁ ning physical and data security 
requirements, and interviewing managers and users, it is time to start the physical RF site 
survey process and the wireless LAN design. This is one of the most important parts of a 
successful wireless LAN deployment. This process includes locating areas and sources of RF 
interference as well as RF coverage (or lack thereof), and determining the locations of access 
points, bridges, sensors, and other infrastructure devices that will be used with the wireless 
network. The following sections detail the entire physical wireless site survey process and

guidelines. The RF physical site survey is a very subjective topic and people have different 
opinions on how the entire process works. In many cases, this process can be tailored based 
on the individual needs or requirements of the location where the wireless LAN will be 
installed. The following steps should be viewed as recommendations or guidelines:
1. 
Arrange a walkthrough of the entire location, which may often require being escorted 
by an authorized person.
2. 
Take thorough notes.
3. 
Perform an RF spectrum analysis.
4. 
Determine preliminary placement of infrastructure devices.
5. 
Perform on-site testing to verify the design.
6. 
Determine actual placement of infrastructure devices.
7. 
Install infrastructure hardware as specified.
8. 
Perform on-site verification testing and make adjustments to verify the design meets 
the specifications.
9. 
Deliver the final site survey report.
In today’s wireless LAN world, an RF site survey can be considered an ongoing process. 
Just a few years ago, not nearly as many wireless networks existed as do today, so the 
interference factor was not as signiﬁ cant. With the RF dynamics constantly changing and 
more devices using RF for communications, it is up to the network engineer to take into 
consideration that site requirements may also be constantly changing. Therefore, the RF 
site survey may need to be updated periodically.
Radio Frequency Spectrum Analysis
The wireless LAN site survey includes ﬁ nding areas of RF coverage and RF interference 
as well as locations for hardware, such as access points, bridges, and other infrastructure 
devices. Although radio frequency is not visible to the human eye, some tools are available 
to “see” a visual representation of the RF. A common tool is the RF spectrum analyzer.
Figure 11.1 shows a spectrum analyzer view of the 2.4 GHz ISM band with the access 
point set to channel 1. Spectrum analyzers will vary in cost and complexity depending on 
the frequency ranges they are designed to work with.
Some spectrum analyzers are available that are designed speciﬁ cally for the wireless 
LAN market. These usually work only in the license-free radio bands and are typically 
less expensive because of spectrum limitations. Spectrum analyzers allow you to view the 
physical layer of communication between devices used in wireless networking. Wireless 
LAN spectrum analyzers are available in PC card models, devices that attach to a USB port 
on the computer, and instrumentation-style devices that can be used for applications other 
than wireless networking. Figure 11.2 shows an example of a WLAN spectrum analyzer 
that connects to a USB port on a computer.

Some manufacturers of wireless LAN equipment integrate spectrum analyzer tools into 
devices such as wireless LAN access points or wireless LAN controllers for constant moni-
toring of the radio frequency. Others offer standalone products that can be used to monitor 
more speciﬁ c areas. Listed here are some manufacturers of wireless LAN spectrum analyzers:

The ability to analyze the RF allows a site surveyor to ﬁ nd areas that lack coverage, 
also known as dead spots, as well as interference caused by other devices and other IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks that operate in the same radio frequency range. Although a spec-
trum analysis is not a requirement for a wireless LAN site survey, it is beneﬁ cial in most 
medium- to large-scale deployments of wireless networks. Because of the vast number of 
devices that use unlicensed radio bands, spectrum analysis can be considered an ongoing 
process. Performing regular spectrum analysis gives wireless LAN engineers the capabil-
ity to monitor the area in which wireless LAN devices are located for RF interference and 
other issues. Figure 11.3 shows an example of a USB-based spectrum analyzer designed for 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.

Wi-Fi and Non-Wi-Fi Interference Sources
The performance of a wireless network can be signiﬁ cantly affected by various types of 
interference sources. Interference may be either intentional or unintentional and caused both 
by IEEE 802.11 wireless networks and by other devices that also operate in the 2.4 GHz 
ISM or 5 GHz UNII band. The use of portable and mobile devices that employ radio fre-
quency for communication continues to rise, so interference from these devices is also more 
prevalent. As mentioned in previous chapters of this book, these interfering devices typically 
operate in the unlicensed radio spectrum 2.4 GHz ISM band. Other sources of interference 
from the industrial, medical, and scientiﬁ c communities will also affect the amount of inter-
ference. Non-Wi-Fi interference in the ISM band can be caused by devices such as these:


Microwave ovens


Cordless telephones


IEEE 802.15 Bluetooth devices

This is by no means a complete list, but it does contain some of the devices used daily 
that may cause some level of interference in the world of wireless networking. Figure 11.4 
shows an example of interference caused by a microwave oven. This ﬁ gure shows a spec-
trum analyzer capture that ran for approximately 30 seconds. Microwave ovens operate in 
the 2.4 GHz frequency range and, depending on the unit, may cause interference with IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks.

Wi-Fi Interference
Wi-Fi interference is caused by IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN devices that operate in the 2.4 
GHz ISM or 5 GHz UNII band. In some cases, this is the largest source of interference for 
wireless LANs. There are two types of Wi-Fi interference: co-channel interference (other 
devices on the same channel) and adjacent channel interference (other devices on overlap-
ping channels). See the sidebar “Standards vs. Industry Deﬁ nitions” for more about how 
these terms are distinguished in the industry generally and by the CWNP exam. 
The following network types will cause Wi-Fi interference:


FHSS networks: 2.4 GHz (Legacy)


DSSS networks: 2.4 GHz


ERP-OFDM networks: 2.4 GHz


OFDM: 5 GHz


HT-OFDM: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz (802.11n)
Wi-Fi devices that cause interference can be operating in either infrastructure mode or ad 
hoc mode. The number of devices that are part of the wireless network will also determine 
the extent of the interference. In Chapter 5, “Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread-
Spectrum Technology,” we discussed different types of spread-spectrum technologies that 
wireless networks use to communicate. FHSS, DSSS, ERP-OFDM, OFDM, and HT-OFDM 
are technologies used for IEEE 802.11 wireless networking in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. 
However, some of these technologies are used in non–wireless LAN devices as well. For 
example, Bluetooth devices operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band also use FHSS technology for 
communication. Zigbee devices operate in the 2.4 GHz band and use DSSS technology 
for communication. Depending on the manufacturer, 2.4 GHz cordless phones may use either 

408 
Chapter 11  Performing an RF Wireless LAN Site Survey
FHSS or DSSS. Performing an RF spectrum analysis is one way you can determine the source 
of this type of interference. If an instrumentation spectrum analyzer (a calibrated device that 
has the capability to view entire radio spectrums) is used, it will be necessary to understand 
how to interpret the data collected as well as how to operate the device.
It is important to note that IEEE 802.11 FHSS wireless LANs are leg-
acy and rarely found with today’s installations. I mention them here 
because although it is unlikely, you could possibly encounter them. 
Also, FHSS is used with other wireless technologies.
Standards vs. Industry Deﬁ nitions
The following information is from the “Exam Terms” document available from www
.cwnp.com and was added here for clariﬁ cation. Be sure to read the entire document prior 
to attempting any CWNP certiﬁ cation exam.
The 802.11 standard loosely deﬁ nes an adjacent channel as any channel with non-
overlapping frequencies for the DSSS and HR/DSSS PHYs. With ERP and OFDM, the 
standard loosely deﬁ nes an adjacent channel as the ﬁ rst channel with a nonoverlap-
ping frequency space.
This contradicts how the term “adjacent channel interference” is typically used in 
the marketplace. Most Wi-Fi vendors use this term to loosely mean both interfer-
ence resulting from overlapping cells and interference resulting from the use of 
overlapping frequency space. For example, vendors typically use this terminology in 
a case where AP-1 (channel 1) is located near AP-2 (channel 2).
The CWNP Program has decided to deﬁ ne two separate terms for clarity: Adjacent 
Overlapping Channel (for example, channels 1 and 2 that are overlapping, and are 
directly next to each other in the band) and Adjacent Non-overlapping Channel (for 
example, channels 1 and 6, which are the ﬁ rst immediately side-by-side channels 
that do not overlap). Channels 1 and 7, 1 and 8, and so on are simply considered 
nonoverlapping channels and are not adjacent.
Adjacent channel interference is a performance condition that occurs when two 
or more access point radios are providing RF coverage to the same physical area 
using overlapping frequencies. Simultaneous RF transmissions by two or more of 
these access point radios in the same physical area can result in corrupted 802.11 
frames because of the frequency overlap. Corrupted 802.11 frames cause retransmis-
sions, which results in both throughput degradation and latency.
Co-channel interference is a performance condition that occurs when two or more 
independently coordinated access point radios are providing RF coverage to the 
same physical area using the same 802.11 channel. Additional RF medium conten-
tion overhead occurs for all radios using this channel in this physical area, resulting 
in throughput degradation and latency.

Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless LAN Site Survey
409
Performing a Manual Radio Frequency 
Wireless LAN Site Survey
Although some in the industry consider the manual wireless LAN RF site survey process 
“old school,” it provides some of the most accurate results. A manual site survey requires a 
physical walkthrough of the area, recording information to determine the performance of 
clients and devices that will be connected to the wireless network. This type of site survey 
can be very accurate because the surveyor is recording actual statistics, such as:


Signal strength


Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)


Data rate of connected devices


Radio Frequency interference
These measurements are recorded while physically moving through the facility or loca-
tion. Recommended received signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values are 
discussed later in this chapter. Small-scale manual site surveys can be performed inexpen-
sively by using either a wireless client adapter with site survey functionality, one of several 
freeware/shareware utilities, or commercial software designed speciﬁ cally for this type of 
application. Figure 11.5 shows an example of a free site survey software program.

Chapter 11  Performing an RF Wireless LAN Site Survey
The manual site survey process can be used for recording measurements to determine 
the actual placement of hardware infrastructure devices and for spot checking, locating 
other IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, or veriﬁ cation after a predictive site survey has deter-
mined the placement of these devices. Not too long ago this manual process was the only 
way to perform a wireless LAN site survey. The main advantage of the manual process is 
accuracy. One disadvantage is that it can be very time-consuming depending on the extent 
of the installation. Some of the basic steps include:
1. 
Obtaining a floor plan or blueprint of the location to be surveyed
2. 
Performing a radio frequency spectrum analysis
3. 
Testing access point placement
4. 
Taking photographs of access point placement with a digital camera for documentation
5. 
Analyzing the site survey results
Obtaining a Floor Plan or Blueprint
The ﬁ rst step in a manual site survey is to review a ﬂ oor plan or blueprint of the location. 
Many in the industry refer to a ﬂ oor plan as a “map.” This could be a simple sketch and 
is required to note access point placement as well as readings. The readings to note on the 
ﬂ oor plan include signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio values from client devices. 
Figure 11.6 shows a basic ﬂ oor plan of a small ofﬁ ce building. The ﬂ oor plan should be 
marked with approximate access point locations. In some cases, a ﬂ oor plan or CAD draw-
ing of the location may not be available. Depending on the size of the location, a ﬁ re evacu-
ation plan could be photographed or scanned in and used as a starting point to create a 
drawing and may be adequate for the site survey.

Identifying Existing Wireless Networks
As part of a manual site survey, you should identify existing wireless LANs in the area, 
noting locations that include possible sources of radio frequency interference and may have 
an impact on the wireless LAN that will be installed. Using a device or software program 
designed speciﬁ cally for wireless networks would be ideal. However, freeware or shareware 
programs may be satisfactory. Figure 11.7 shows an example of a software program that 
can be used to ﬁ nd existing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.
F I G U R E  11.7   The AirMagnet Wi-Fi Analyzer can be used to view existing IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks.
Testing Access Point Placement
Once you have identiﬁ ed potential locations for access points, you can start testing the pro-
posed access point placement. This can be done by temporarily mounting an access point at 

412
Chapter 11  Performing an RF Wireless LAN Site Survey
the desired location to get the most accurate results. In some cases, a tool or ﬁ xture made 
speciﬁ cally for wireless LAN site surveys or even a tall ladder could be used as a temporary 
mounting solution. Refer to the documentation that was created prior to going on-site for 
mounting locations. 
It is always best to use test access points from the same manufacturer and, if possible, 
the same model that will be used in the actual deployment during the pre and post deploy-
ment manual site survey process. This practice will yield a better outcome than using 
generic access points during testing. Figure 11.8 shows an example of a temporary mount-
ing solution.
F I G U R E  11. 8   Access point temporarily mounted using an expandable light pole
Using one or possibly two temporarily mounted access points, document the results 
of the testing while moving around the facility. One testing method is to IEEE 802.11 
authenticate and associate to the test access points using the site survey computer. A pas-
sive process (listening to all access points in the area) may also be used for this type of site 
survey. The area to be tested should include a reasonable proximity around the tempo-
rarily mounted access point. The extents should be the desired minimum received signal 
threshold, –67 dBm for example. The information recorded and documented will depend 
on the surveyor but commonly includes signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio. It may be 
necessary to make adjustments of access point mounting during the testing process, based 
on the results of the onsite testing process. It would be beneﬁ cial to test an actual wire-
less client device and software application that will be used with the network in order to 
see if the performance meets expectations. Software-assisted programs as described later 
in this chapter are commonly used for a site survey of any size in today’s wireless LAN 
deployments.

Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless LAN Site Survey 
413
Analyzing the Results
Once all the testing is complete, it is necessary to perform an ofﬂ ine analysis to determine 
the ﬁ nal placement of access points or other infrastructure devices that may be used in the 
wireless LAN deployment. This may include making adjustments from the original plan 
prior to testing or possibly adding and removing access points. The use of various antennas 
may also need to be analyzed and documented.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Manual Site Surveys
Listed here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of the manual site survey process:


Advantages


Very accurate because it is based on actual readings


Physical characteristics of building are physically tested (attenuation values)


Allows verification of actual RF signal coverage


Allows marking exact installation locations of hardware while on-site


Disadvantages


Can be very-time consuming


Usually only one access point is used for testing, so readings will need to be 
merged


Requires a physical walkthrough of entire location


Many areas require an escort and special clearances for access
WLAN equipment used in a manual site survey should be from the 
same manufacturer as the hardware that will be installed in the actual 
deployment. This will minimize any potential issues from variations 
between manufacturers’ devices.
Software-Assisted Manual Site Survey
The manual site survey technique discussed earlier in this section may be adequate for 
smaller deployments or for organizations that have limited resources and budget. Manual 
site surveys can also be accomplished with the aid of commercial software programs 
designed speciﬁ cally for this process. These programs vary in cost, complexity, and features 
and contain many advanced features, including:


Capability to perform both passive and active surveys


Capability to import floor plans with support for many graphic formats, including 
JPG, BMP, and CAD formats

The Passive Wireless LAN Site Survey
A passive site survey consists of monitoring the air and recording the radio frequency infor-
mation from all wireless access points and wireless client stations or devices in the “hearing 
range” of the surveying station and includes radio frequency information from your own 
and neighboring devices. This type of site survey does not require an IEEE 802.11 authen-
tication and association to an access point, and no trafﬁ c is passed between the survey 
station and the access point. A passive survey will provide an overall snapshot of the RF in 
use in or around the location, including RF noise and other IEEE 802.11 wireless networks 
in the area. It is used to get an overall picture of the wireless LAN access points that are 
transmitting within the area being surveyed. Figure 11.9 shows an example of a commer-
cial site survey application in passive mode.
F I G U R E  11. 9   Ekahau Site Survey (ESS) showing passive survey

Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless LAN Site Survey
415
Since passive site surveys do not require an association to an access point, all radio fre-
quencies will be detected, displayed, and recorded. Most commercial software applications 
with this functionality will have the capability to ﬁ lter on speciﬁ c access points from the 
information that was recorded.
The Active Site Wireless LAN Survey
An active site survey consists of a survey device such as a notebook computer associating 
to an access point prior to taking readings and collecting the data. Some claim this type 
of manual survey will provide more accurate results because of this direct IEEE 802.11 
authentication and association to an access point. The association of the survey device to 
an access point will actively send and receive some basic RF information to and from the 
access point, allowing the information about signal strength and noise levels to be recorded. 
Figure 11.10 shows a commercial site survey performing an active site survey.
F I G U R E  11.10   AirMagnet Survey showing an active site survey
Performing either a passive or active site survey using software involves many of the 
same steps discussed in “Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless LAN Site 
Survey” earlier in this chapter. The main difference is the features and capabilities that are 
available in these commercial software packages. These elaborate features will eliminate 
the need to manually document and record all the information obtained while walking the 
area because the program handles this task for the surveyor.
In Exercise 11.2 you will explore the Ekahau HeatMapper site survey program. If you 
have a ﬂ oor plan of your area, you can perform an actual manual wireless site survey.

Manual Site Survey Toolkit
To perform a manual site survey, you need a toolkit containing essential components. A 
ﬂ oor plan or blueprint is required to record data collected during a manual site survey. If an 
assisted software program is used, both an electronic version of the ﬂ oor plan and a paper 
printout are necessary. Site survey toolkits will vary in complexity and cost. Planning the 
equipment and tools you will need for a manual site survey is very important. I recommend 
you take everything you will need and not take items you will not need. Taking items you 
do not need creates an unnecessary burden. Many times you may be the only person per-
forming the physical survey, and you need to realize the limits. You can create your own 
site survey kit based on what you will need, or you can purchase a kit from a manufacturer 
that is built speciﬁ cally for this purpose. Figure 11.11 shows a wireless LAN IEEE 802.11n 
MIMO site survey kit from TerraWave Solutions.

421
The following lists some items that may be included in a Wireless LAN site survey kit. Keep 
in mind this covers some of the most common items and the kit will vary based on the site 
survey and the person performing the site survey.
Spectrum Analyzer (Optional but Recommended)  A spectrum analyzer is an optional 
but recommended item that may be used in an RF wireless LAN site survey. This device 
will sweep the area to look for devices that may cause interference with the deployment 
and locate all the radio frequency information in the area. Spectrum analyzers vary in cost 
and features, as discussed earlier in this chapter. Although “optional,” this tool is highly 
recommended. 
Wireless Access Points  One or two access points are needed to take signal measurements 
during the manual site survey process. It is important to use access points from the same 
manufacturer and if possible the same model that will be installed, to simulate what will be 
used in the actual installation. If this cannot be achieved, try to get an access point that is 
as close as possible to those that will be used in the deployment.
I recommend that you set the test access points’ output power level at 
about 50 percent or less during the site survey. This usually requires 
lowering the default power, which in many cases is set at maximum. 
This will allow for adjustments after installation to help compensate 
for potential differences from when the space was originally surveyed. 
The output power settings used will be determined by the individual 
performing the site survey. It is also important to keep in mind that 
if you are performing a site survey for both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz 
bands, the amount of RF transmit power as well as the gain of the 
antennas must be taken into consideration because of the difference in 
wavelength, which will in turn affect the range.
Wireless Client Device Such as a Notebook Computer  A device to take measurements 
from the client side is an important component of the site survey kit. This can be a note-
book computer or tablet with appropriate software to take signal measurements. Size and 
weight should be considered as well. A Wi-Fi, VoIP handset may also be used for locations 
that are considering WLAN voice over Internet Protocol capabilities. It is best to try to 
match the survey client devices with those that will actually be used by the users of the 
wireless network. However, this is not required.
Portable Battery Packs or Extension Cords  Portable battery packs to temporarily power 
the wireless access points are highly recommended. However, if these are not available, 
extension cords are a good substitute. The disadvantage of extension cords is that they 
require accessible AC power outlets, which might not be available at all sites. Also, they 
may be difﬁ cult to use and can be cumbersome. An extra battery pack for the survey device 
is also recommended. Battery packs speciﬁ cally designed for wireless LAN site surveys 

422
Chapter 11  Performing an RF Wireless LAN Site Survey
are available from a variety of manufacturers. Most battery packs will last longer than the 
surveyor.
Various Antennas (If Required)  If antennas other than those mounted directly to an access 
point will be used in the deployment, a variety of these antennas should be on hand for 
testing during the site survey process. If 802.11n technology will be tested during the site 
survey, appropriate 802.11n antennas will be required as part of the site survey kit. If you do 
not plan to use different antennas, there is no value in taking them along during the survey.
Temporary Mounting Hardware  Mounting hardware for temporarily mounting access 
points and antennas should also be considered, including expandable poles, brackets, tape, 
and nylon tie straps. You may have to be creative when it comes to temporary mounting. It 
is critical to make safety a number-one priority when performing this task.
Measuring Device, Either Tape or Wheel  A measuring tape or wheel is recommended 
for measuring distance to wiring closets and distance between access points and any other 
areas where distance is of importance. Laser measuring tools are also available, but many 
are only capable of short distances. If possible it would be beneﬁ cial to have both a tape or 
wheel and a laser measuring device.
Digital Camera  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Using a digital camera 
to take photographs of situations that may be difﬁ cult to explain in writing is a great help. 
This also adds quality to wireless site survey reports. Digital camera technology is now 
very inexpensive and most smart phones and tablets have this capability built in. I recom-
mend taking many digital photographs when possible, especially in those areas that may be 
difﬁ cult to describe in writing. It is better to have the photographs if the need arises than 
to wish you had them. Photographs of potential access point locations are valuable should 
physical limitations of the facility come into question. Also, photographs of existing devices 
are useful to determine if they are damaged or poorly deployed and need to be revisited as 
part of the new device deployment. 
Pens, Pencils, Markers, and Paper  Documentation is a critical part of wireless site sur-
veys as well as all other areas of the network. Keeping thorough and accurate notes will 
allow the surveyor to document areas of importance. Even with the advanced portable 
technology you have in your possession, it is always a good idea to have paper and writ-
ing utensils. Markers can also be used to identify the locations where access points will be 
installed.
Ladders and Lifts  Ladders or lifts are required for mounting temporary access points and 
antennas. The height of the ladder or lift will depend on the mounting locations for the 
access points. Keep in mind that the surveyor may not be allowed to use a ladder or lift at 
certain locations or in some areas. You may have to work with the facility manager to get 
someone who will be able to perform this task.
Movable Cart  A movable cart or dolly to move all equipment used for the site survey will 
ease the burden of getting the equipment moved safely around the facility. Depending on 
the amount of site survey equipment and the number of access points, batteries, poles, lad-
ders, and so on, it can be a cumbersome task to move all this around. This is especially true 
in larger facilities, and carts make this task much easier.

Performing a Predictive Modeling Site 
Survey
A predictive modeling site survey can be an accurate way to design a wireless LAN with-
out having to spend time on-site performing a physical walkthrough and testing of the 
entire location. A predictive modeling site survey is a software-based site survey in which 
a ﬂ oor plan (map) or drawing of the area to be surveyed is imported into the program. The 
program then simulates the radio frequency propagation from access points by using the 
attenuation properties of various structural components. The surveyor can trace over walls, 
windows, doors, and other elements of the physical location in order to estimate the RF 
attenuation and show how the RF propagates based on the environment. This type of site 
survey can be performed in several different ways depending on the equipment used. You 
can use a standalone commercial software program designed speciﬁ cally for this purpose 
or, in some cases, manufacturers build this site survey functionality directly into a wireless 
LAN controller. Some manufacturers now have web-based wireless site survey programs, 
and the design is performed online. 
This type of site survey requires the wireless engineer or surveyor to input a ﬂ oor plan 
drawing of the facility, such as a CAD, JPEG, BMP, or other format ﬁ le, directly into the 
software program or the controller. Then details such as the attenuation values of the facil-
ity are added. This information includes: 


Type of walls: for example, drywall, brick, or poured concrete


Thickness of walls


Types of windows, including glass, thickness, and coating


Type of doors, such as hollow core, solid core, fire doors, wood, steel


Location of certain types of furnishings, such as cubicle offices


Height of the ceiling
One thing to keep in mind about a predictive modeling site survey is that the accuracy 
and ﬁ nal results are only as good as the information that was input into the program. 
Basically it equates to “garbage in, garbage out.” It is essential for the surveyor to use 
accurate information about the location, including the attenuation value of all the building 
materials. Figure 11.12 shows a predictive modeling wireless LAN site survey tool.
Here are some the advantages and disadvantages of using the predictive modeling site 
survey process:

Protocol Analysis
Wireless LAN protocol analyzers are becoming a common tool, and many network admin-
istrators will have one as part of their wireless LAN toolkit. A protocol analyzer allows 
a network administrator or engineer to view all wireless frames that are traversing across 
the air in the hearing range of the analysis device. At one time protocol analysis was a spe-
cialty role, and without extensive training few people had the skills to perform this task. 
Along with the evolution of wireless LAN technology in recent years, protocol analyzers are 
becoming more mainstream, affordable, and easier to use. Many variations of analyzers are 
available in the market today. Listed here are some of the manufacturers and their products:

Most wireless protocol analyzers require the use of certain network 
adapters and in many cases a special device driver. I recommend that 
you verify you have access to an adapter supported by the protocol 
analyzer’s manufacturer.
Protocol analyzers are available in software programs that can be installed on a notebook 
computer and are also available in specialty dedicated handheld devices. In addition to perform-
ing protocol analysis or frame decoding, many analyzers are feature-rich, with the capability to 
view security information, perform legislative compliance analysis and reporting, and generate 
a variety of reports. Figure 11.13 shows an example of a wireless LAN protocol analyzer.
The main goals of a wireless LAN analyzer, or any protocol analyzer, are to trouble-
shoot network problems, gather information about security issues, and optimize the net-
work’s performance. When it comes to wireless LAN site surveys, a protocol analyzer is a 
valuable tool for evaluating which wireless LAN devices are currently in the same RF space 
where the proposed wireless LAN will be deployed. They can also be used to view the 
signal strength, security implementations, network name or SSID, and which channels 
access points and other devices are currently operating on. An analyzer will show not 
only access points but any wireless LAN device that may have an impact on the site survey 
and deployment. Some of the devices an analyzer is able to locate and identify include:


Documenting Existing Network 
Characteristics
Existing wireless networks can play a big role in a new wireless LAN deployment. 
Understanding the current location of infrastructure and other wireless LAN devices is 
an important part of a wireless LAN site survey. One way to see devices that are part of 
a wireless network is to use a protocol analyzer. Other programs will also be able to view 
existing wireless networks, such as NetStumbler and InSSIDer, and in some cases these 
programs may be adequate based on the complexity and size of the site survey. But these 
typically do not have the extensive feature set that many protocol analyzer packages have.
Some of the questions that you should take into consideration when performing a wire-
less LAN site survey are:


What frequency range will the new wireless LAN operate in?


Are there any existing IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs in the same RF space?


Will all or part of the existing wireless LAN be utilized in the new deployment?


What effect will the neighboring wireless networks have on this deployment?
Ignoring existing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks may have a signiﬁ cant impact on how 
the wireless LAN will operate and result in poor performance for the clients or devices that 
will be connecting.

networks.

Infrastructure Hardware Selection and Placement
437
RF Coverage Requirements
As mentioned previously, one of the main goals of a wireless LAN site survey is to deter-
mine areas of RF interference and RF coverage. The details of the required coverage and 
capacity in any wireless network are part of the wireless LAN design, which involves 
determining the need, use, and business requirements of the network. This was discussed in 
Chapter 10. Some of the factors that need to be taken into consideration during a physical 
site survey are:


Size of the physical location


Number of users and wireless devices, including bring your own device (BYOD)


Obstacles that may impact RF signal propagation


Radio frequency range


Bandwidth requirements of applications to be used


Selected radio frequency of wireless LAN hardware
The planning process will provide some of the answers whereas a site visit and on-site 
testing will determine others, such as obstacles, signal propagation, and RF range.
Infrastructure Hardware Selection and 
Placement
In addition to identifying areas of RF coverage and interference, a site survey will deter-
mine the best locations for wireless access points and other infrastructure devices. The cor-
rect placement of these devices is important in order to allow clients and devices to beneﬁ t 
fully from the deployment of wireless LAN. The location of these devices is traditionally 
based on the following criteria:


Desired RF coverage


Required bandwidth


Aesthetics requirements


Applications both hardware and software


RF cell overlap


Channel reuse patterns
Mapping out the infrastructure device placement is considered part of the planning and 
design process. Manual, software-assisted, or predictive modeling site survey processes will 
help identify the proper locations based on the items mentioned above. In most cases, a pre-
liminary visit to the location is highly recommended regardless of the size and the site survey 
method that will be used. Knowing the physical location will beneﬁ t the entire site 
survey process because it will help identify areas of concern.

438
Chapter 11  Performing an RF Wireless LAN Site Survey
Infrastructure Connectivity and Power 
Requirements
Even though the main objectives of this book are all about wireless networking, it is still 
important to understand that infrastructure devices require some sort of wired connec-
tivity for data and electrical power. Data access will usually come by way of an Ethernet 
connection from a wired network infrastructure or backbone. As stated in the IEEE 802.3 
Ethernet standard, the maximum length for unshielded twisted-pair Ethernet cable is 328 
feet or 100 meters. This limitation may have an impact on how and where access points 
and other infrastructure devices are placed.
During the wireless site survey process, the surveyor will need access to wiring closets. 
This will allow the surveyor to evaluate and perform a survey of the wired network infra-
structure as well.
Another consideration is electrical power requirements. Infrastructure devices need 
electrical power as well as data connectivity to operate. If the electrical power is decen-
tralized and located at each device, an electrician will need to evaluate and determine the 
requirements.
An option for supplying electrical power to infrastructure devices is Power over Ethernet 
(PoE). This technology is now very common and is supported by all enterprise device 
manufacturers. A survey of the wired infrastructure and devices is almost always required 
to determine if the infrastructure will be capable of handling the new PoE devices that will 
be installed. Keep in mind that zoning and building regulations, electrical contractors, and 
labor union requirements may add to the overall cost of wireless LAN deployment. PoE 
was discussed in Chapter 3, “Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices.”
Received Signal Strength
The main objective of a wireless network is to provide access to computer network 
resources and services for wireless devices that are connected to the network. This means 
it is essential for wireless client devices to have reliable connectivity to the wireless network 
infrastructure. To provide this connectivity, the wireless site survey process should include 
testing to verify that the received signal is adequate for the application of the device.
Devices that communicate wirelessly require two-way communications in order to oper-
ate correctly. This means the receiver must be able to receive enough of the signal in order 
to determine the data that was sent from the transmitter. Wireless LAN client devices use 
what is known as the received signal strength to show the amount of power received from 
a transmission. Figure 11.15 shows a client utility that displays speciﬁ cs regarding the 
received signal.

Received Signal Strength 
439
F I G U R E  11.15   Broadcom Wireless Utility shows signal, noise, and data rate.
The amount of received signal strength required will be determined by the type or appli-
cation of the wireless device as well as the amount of radio frequency noise in the area. 
RF noise consists of extraneous undesired radio signals in the area emitted by a variety of 
devices other than the transmitter. You should check with the device manufacturer to deter-
mine the minimum amount of received signal that is acceptable for a speciﬁ c application. 
Some applications will require more received signal than others. For example, the manufac-
turer of a voice handset may recommend a minimum of –65 dBm to –67, dBm whereas a 
computer network card may require a minimum of –70 dBm.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the difference between the received signal and the 
noise ﬂ oor. For example, if the received signal is –65 dBm and the noise ﬂ oor is –95 dBm, 
then the signal-to-noise ratio will be 30 dB. This value is calculated by subtracting the 
received signal from the noise. In this case –65 dBm – (–95 dBm) = 30 dB.
The recommended signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for most wireless LAN 
systems is a minimum of 20 to 25 dB.

440 
Chapter 11  Performing an RF Wireless LAN Site Survey
In IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology, the received signal strength 
indicator (RSSI) value is an arbitrary number assigned by the device 
manufacturer. There is no standard for this value, and it will not be 
comparable between devices from different manufacturers. When 
performing a site survey, whenever possible it is beneficial to survey 
with the same network adapter model that will be used in the deploy-
ment. This will provide more accurate results for the client devices 
using the network.
Testing Antenna Use 
In Chapter 7, “Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories,” we looked at various types of 
antennas, including omnidirectional, semidirectional, and highly directional models. The 
characteristics and features of these antennas were discussed, as well as the best use for 
each based on a speciﬁ c scenario. In Chapter 10 we looked in more detail at the most com-
mon scenarios and the antenna choices they typically dictate. Here we’ll consider how best 
to conduct antenna testing in a wireless LAN site survey
As part of a manual site survey, it may be necessary to test different antennas to determine 
the best RF coverage. This usually requires the surveyor to connect and temporarily mount 
various types of antennas to access points in order to determine the proper radiation pattern 
and to verify RF coverage within the desired area. Some predictive modeling site survey pro-
grams will allow you to change different antennas so you can see how that will change the 
RF propagation pattern. A temporary antenna mounting example is shown in Figure 11.16.

Yagi and Patch antennas

Testing Antenna Use  
441
Testing Multiple Antenna Types
If different antennas will be used in the deployment, it is important for the surveyor to 
have several types of antennas as part of the site survey kit. Some organizations that deploy 
wireless networks are extremely concerned about aesthetics; they will allow only spe-
ciﬁ c types of antennas to be used. For example, if access points with removable antennas 
are used, in many cases the only type allowed will be omnidirectional antennas that are 
attached directly to the access point with a gain of about 2 or 3 dBi. Other deployments 
may use access points in which antennas are permanently part of the access point and can-
not be removed or changed.
Keep in mind that polarization of antennas must be taken into con-
sideration during a manual site survey. Polarization of antennas for 
infrastructure devices is critical, and tests should mimic as closely as 
possible what will actually be installed. With the variety of wireless 
client devices that may be used in a wireless network, it is a chal-
lenge to predict the polarization of all the devices that might be used. 
However, it is advisable for the surveyor to take this into consider-
ation during the site survey.
Choosing the Correct Antennas
Choosing the correct antenna to be used in a speciﬁ c deployment is part of the wireless design 
and site survey process. Many factors play a role in determining which antenna will be best 
for the application. Some locations have strict requirements about the type of antenna that 
may be used. Therefore, the surveyor may have to work with speciﬁ c antennas to ensure 
proper RF coverage. Take the following factors into consideration when choosing antennas:
Manufacturer’s Recommendations  The manufacturer of an access point may recommend 
only a speciﬁ c type of antenna. If this is the case, it is important to perform the site survey 
with the same type of antenna.
Customer Requirements  A customer may require only speciﬁ c types of antennas to be 
used. In this case, the survey should be performed with the type of antenna required by the 
customer. For example, a deployment consisting of walled ofﬁ ces may require the use of thin 
access points. Usually this type of access point uses an omnidirectional internal antenna.
Environmental Conditions  The environment where the wireless network is installed may 
also determine the type of antenna to be used. If the location is a factory with harsh envi-
ronmental conditions, that could have an impact on the type of antenna and may also call 
for an enclosure for the access point.
Aesthetics  Many organizations are sensitive to the type of devices that are seen by cus-
tomers and clients. Therefore aesthetically pleasing antennas may be required by the cus-
tomer in order to be a good ﬁ t for the location in which they will be used. Figure 11.17 
shows an example of this type of antenna.

442

Required Coverage  The required RF coverage will also affect the choice of antenna as 
well as the gain of the antenna. For example, a large ofﬁ ce area may require the use of 
omnidirectional antennas that are physically attached to access points. A manufacturing 
facility may require semidirectional antennas to cover areas of the manufacturing ﬂ oor. 
Keep in mind that in addition to being passive bidirectional ampliﬁ ers, antennas shape the 
coverage by either an increase or decrease in antenna gain.
Number of Wireless Access Points  The number of access points to be installed in a loca-
tion will also be a determining factor in the type of antenna to be used. An ofﬁ ce build-
ing with a combination of walled ofﬁ ces and cubicles may have a dense deployment of 
access points with a limited number of users connecting to any particular access point. 
Omnidirectional antennas connected directly to the access point may be an adequate solu-
tion for this type of deployment.
Physical Geometry of Location  The attributes of the physical location will have an effect on 
the type of antenna to be installed and therefore should be tested during the site survey. This 
includes propagation of the signal and attenuation of obstacles. In the case where a building 
has long hallways or corridors, a Yagi antenna would be a good candidate for a solution.
Regulatory Agency and Local Codes  When selecting antennas, both indoors and out-
doors, it is important to become familiar with and completely understand any radio fre-
quency limits or regulations that apply from the governing body, regulatory agency, or 
any local codes that exist. In addition to the radio frequency codes, these may include, for 
example, height limitations and proximity to airports. Violations of any of the above may 
result in large ﬁ nes or other penalties.
Wireless Channel Architectures
There are two common types of channel architectures available today that pertain to IEEE 
802.11 wireless LAN technology. In wireless LAN technology, channel architecture is the 
design, layout, or channel plan in use. In the 2.4 GHz band, for example, the use of non-
overlapping channels 1, 6, and 11 is a channel architecture. The CWNP program deﬁ nes 

Wireless Channel Architectures

these two wireless LAN architectures as multiple-channel architecture (MCA) and single-
channel architecture (SCA).
Multiple-Channel Architecture
Most wireless LAN deployments today use multiple-channel architecture (MCA). This type 
of installation will use access points set to different RF channels in order to avoid over-
lapping channel interference, as shown in Figure 11.18. A channel plan may be used with 
access points set to speciﬁ c channels, or in many cases automatic channel selection allows 
the devices to choose the best channel to operate on. Until recently this is how all wireless 
LAN access points were deployed.

Single-Channel Architecture 
Single-channel architecture (SCA) is a wireless networking technology available from only 
one manufacturer. SCA allows all access points to communicate on the same RF channel. 
The controller that the access points are connected to manages these access points and 
avoids co-channel interference. In single-channel deployments, not all access points are 
transmitting at the same time. The controller will determine which access points can trans-
mit simultaneously based on the wireless devices that are in a speciﬁ c area. A wireless LAN 
site survey for SCA equates to providing radio frequency coverage based on the access point 
placements as the wireless LAN controller manages all the radio frequency.
There are a few terms you should know with respect to single-channel architecture: 
stacking, spanning, and blanketing. They all refer to a means of managing coverage in a 
single-channel architecture.
For example, let’s look at a three-story building. Each ﬂ oor in the building may be 
assigned a channel to use; with SCA architecture this is known as stacking. The ﬁ rst ﬂ oor 
would be set to channel 1, the second ﬂ oor would be set to channel 6, and the third 
ﬂ oor would be set to channel 11. Since all access points on the same ﬂ oor are set to the 
same RF channel, co-channel interference or overlapping channel interference is not a sig-
niﬁ cant issue because of how the SCA technology works.

Using single-channel architecture may help save some time when it comes to the site sur-
vey. It is best to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for deployment for this type of 
system. Figure 11.19 shows an example of single-channel architecture.

Wireless Device Installation 
Limitations
The installation limitations of any device that will be installed and used on the wireless 
network need to be evaluated. Sometimes things look great on paper, but when it comes 
time to actually perform the task it may be a little different. The installation limitations of 
various wireless devices include the following:
Wireless Access Points  An installer may run into limitations when it comes to mounting 
access points or other infrastructure devices. For this reason the surveyor must pay close 
attention to the intended location where these devices will be mounted. The type of ceil-
ing and mounting hardware need to be considered. A wireless site survey should include a 
physical walkthrough evaluation of the proposed mounting locations to observe any issues 
that may affect where access points, bridges, or repeaters can be mounted.
Antennas  If antennas other than those that are designed to be connected directly to an 
access point are used, special circumstances may need to be taken into account, including:


Mounting issues


Cabling issues


Aesthetics


Height restrictions
Ethernet/PoE  As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the maximum distance an Ethernet 
unshielded twisted pair cable can run is 328 feet or 100 meters, per the IEEE 802.3

standard. Part of the wireless site survey process includes veriﬁ cation of the distance infra-
structure devices will be mounted from the wiring closet to be certain they do not exceed 
the maximum. The capabilities of the Ethernet system must also be evaluated to verify the 
capacity of the wiring system. This will ensure that there is adequate connectivity for the 
new wireless infrastructure devices.
If PoE will be used, it is important to verify that the infrastructure will be able to sup-
port the number of devices that require DC power from the PoE infrastructure devices. If 
the current wired infrastructure is not PoE compliant, the infrastructure may need to be 
upgraded prior to wireless deployment. If an upgrade is not feasible, an alternate solution 
such as single port power injectors or patch panels may be required.
Local Code Restrictions  In some cases, places like elevator shafts and stairwells have 
become areas where local codes or regulations will not allow devices to be installed. This 
must be identiﬁ ed up front for expectation purposes, especially where voice over wireless 
LAN is used so the users are aware of the limitations that may be beyond the surveyor or 
installer’s control. Also, it is important to be aware of the fact that some ﬁ re codes may 
require plenum rated (ﬁ re-retardant) cable and devices in certain places where wireless 
LANs will be installed.
Site Survey Report
The survey report should be a complete document itemizing all components of the 
wireless site survey. This includes the business aspects of the wireless site survey as 
discussed in Chapter 10 as well as the physical aspects of the wireless site survey as dis-
cussed in this chapter. This report should include but not be limited to notes, charts, 
graphs, photos, test results, and any other pertinent data that will have an effect on the 
wireless LAN deployment. Most reports will be of a custom nature based on the indi-
vidual needs and requirements of the customer. Most commercial site survey application 
programs have built-in reporting features that can be included in the site survey report. 
Figure 11.20 shows a sample page from a commercial site survey application with report 
generation features.
The main content of the site survey report should include:

As I mentioned in the earlier section “The Physical Radio Frequency Site Survey 
Process,” the RF dynamics of many environments are constantly changing as more devices 
using radio frequency for communications become a part of the wireless LAN or share the

requirements may also be constantly changing. Therefore the RF site survey is becoming

Summary

Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the wireless LAN site survey process. This process is 
one of the most important components of a successful wireless LAN deployment. Many 
areas need to be considered, including an RF spectrum analysis to determine RF interfer-
ence sources that may affect the wireless deployment. Although a spectrum analysis can be 
considered optional, it is advisable to complete one whenever possible. Keep in mind the 
spectrum analysis is based on a walkthrough of a facility and recording data at an instant 
in time. The results of this type of spectrum analysis can change once the surveyor has left 
the area. Spectrum analyzers are available in various types, consisting of instrumentation 
devices, PC card–based, USB adapters, and now may be part of the wireless access point.
In this chapter we compared Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi sources of interference, both which 
can have an effect on the performance of a wireless LAN installation. It is important to 
understand the various sources of interference, such as:

Other IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs
We looked at the various types of wireless site surveys that can be performed, including 
manual and predictive modeling. We also explored the two types of manual site surveys, 
passive and active. Passive surveys see all RF from access points in the hearing range of the 
survey device. An active survey requires an association to a speciﬁ c access point. Manual 
site surveys typically require a walkthrough of the entire area. Predictive modeling site 
surveys perform a simulated analysis of the proposed space where the wireless LAN will be 
deployed. The accuracy of a predictive survey is dependent on the information input to the 
program. Both manual and predictive site surveys can be simpliﬁ ed by using a variety of 
software programs made speciﬁ cally for this function.
We discussed some of the items that may be included in a survey toolkit as well as tem-
porary mounting examples for access points and antennas. We looked at the use of a proto-
col analyzer in a wireless site survey and how one could be used to identify existing wireless 
networks in the area of concern.
Finally, you learned about both multiple-channel architecture (MCA) and single-channel 
architecture (SCA) and the differences between them. Best practices for hardware place-
ment were also reviewed, including access points and antennas as well as some of the limi-
tations that may be encountered during the wireless LAN site survey process.

Troubleshooting and maintenance are important parts of a 
successful IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN deployment. Wireless 
networks, like most areas of technology, do require support 
and maintenance. The extent of this will depend on the size and complexity of the network. 
Troubleshooting problems is a key component in the maintenance, reliability, and opera-
tion of an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. A wireless LAN technical support engineer will 
encounter all the same problems that occur with regular networking as well as additional 
problems because this technology uses radio frequency for communication and to exchange 
information. 
In this chapter, you will learn about common problems associated with standards-based 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, how to identify problems based on the symptoms, and 
how to determine whether they are global (affecting many) or isolated (affecting an indi-
vidual). These problems range in complexity and magnitude and many times are associated 
with the following:


Wireless connectivity


Radio frequency received signal strength


Wireless LAN throughput

Wireless infrastructure and client device upgrades
Troubleshooting is not something that can be learned overnight or from reading a book. 
Troubleshooting is an acquired skill that requires many hours of hard work and the “school 
of hard knocks.” This is true with any type of troubleshooting, not just computer network-
ing. Becoming a good mechanic, for example, takes years of working with automobiles to 
learn how to diagnose and perform the necessary repairs.
The steps involved in troubleshooting a wireless networking problem will vary, and 
they depend on the complexity of the network and the environment. In this chapter, we 
will discuss causes and solutions associated with throughput, connectivity, signal strength, 
and upgrades. We will also explore procedures used for optimizing a wireless network. 
Some of these topics may sound familiar because they are also related to site surveys; 
however, you may have to make changes to accommodate physical environment conditions 
that have an impact on a wireless LAN installation. Finally, we will review multipath and 
the effect it has on an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN, and look at different types of hidden 
node problems.

Identifying Wireless LAN Problems
455
Identifying Wireless LAN Problems
A ﬁ rst step in troubleshooting wireless LAN problems is to identify whether an issue is 
global or isolated. Global issues often include wired and wireless infrastructure devices and 
components. A global problem usually involves many client devices or groups of devices. 
Some of the wireless devices that can be related to a global problem include:


Wireless access points


Wireless bridges


Wireless LAN controllers


Wired infrastructure devices
In addition to wireless infrastructure devices like access points, wired infrastructure 
components like Ethernet switches or Layer 3 routers can also be a potential source of 
global problems. Keep in mind that wireless client devices nearly always require a wired 
infrastructure in order to pass information between infrastructure devices or outside the 
wireless network. Devices and components that can contribute to wired infrastructure 
problems include:

Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
Once it has been determined whether the problem is global or isolated, appropriate steps 
are necessary to determine the solution. But before we look at common problems associated 
with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, it is important to understand a little more detail 
about how wireless LAN technology functions. This includes understanding the compo-
nents used to send and receive radio frequency information and is accomplished by two 
main components:


Radio frequency transmitter


Radio frequency receiver
Radio Frequency Transmitters and Receivers
As discussed in previous chapters, IEEE 802.11 wireless networks use radio frequency to 
send and receive data. This is possible because all wireless devices have transmitter and/
or receiver capability. Unlike a television or FM radio you may have in your home, both of 
which are only receivers, all IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN devices have the capability to act 
as either a transmitter or a receiver (also known as a transceiver). The following sections 
explain transmitter and receiver functionality in order to provide the groundwork neces-
sary to diagnose and resolve IEEE 802.11 wireless networking problems.
Radio Transmitter
In wireless networking, a transmitter combines binary digital computer data (all of the 1s 
and 0s) with high-frequency alternating current (AC) signals to prepare it to be sent across 
the air. This is known as modulation. The connected antenna then transforms this signal 
into radio waves and propagates them through the air. The frequency of the signal depends 
on the technology in use. With IEEE 802.11 standards-based wireless networking, there are 
a few select frequency ranges.
Radio Receiver
A receiver collects the propagated signal from the air using an antenna and reverses 
the process by transforming the received signal back into an alternating current signal. 
Through the use of a demodulation process, the digital data is recovered. The modula-
tion/demodulation technology used depends on the wireless standard or amendment 
with which the device is compliant. For example, an IEEE 802.11g wireless LAN will 
use 64QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) when transmitting data at 54 Mbps. 
Figure 12.2 illustrates this entire process. Keep in mind that wireless LAN devices are 
transceivers, so they have the capability of performing either task. In this ﬁ gure, the 
access point is the transmitter and the client device is the receiver. The details of modu-
lation technologies are beyond the scope of the CWTS exam objectives and are not 
covered in this book.
Figure 12.2 sums up the entire process of IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN communications 
discussed throughout this book and is an introduction to understanding the process of 
troubleshooting.

Wireless LAN Connectivity—Coverage 
and Capacity Problems
Many factors can cause connectivity problems in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. Wired com-
puter networks use physical cabling to connect devices. This bounded medium is less likely 
to have connection issues unless the physical medium (cable) is damaged or broken. With 
wireless communications there is no bounded medium, because the air is what’s used to 
carry the data using radio frequency.
No Wireless Connectivity
Several components of a network can cause connectivity issues with wireless networking. 
Keep in mind that wireless networks are not bound by a physical medium such as Ethernet 
cable; therefore, issues other than wiring may result in either no connectivity or intermit-
tent connection problems.
Let’s review some of the OSI model information discussed in Chapter 1, “Introduction 
to Computer Networking.” The Physical layer provides the medium for connectivity (the 
air) in a wireless network and is used to carry radio frequency information that contains 
the computer data. This layer also includes components such as network adapter cards, 
which provide an interface to the wireless computer or other wireless device. Layer 1

No Wireless Connectivity on the Client Side
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks require Physical layer connectivity in order to provide suc-
cessful communications. This section describes some potential connectivity issues associ-
ated with client-side wireless devices. In many cases, no connectivity on the client side is 
an isolated issue that will not affect a large number of devices or users. Problems that can 
cause client-side lack of connectivity include:


Disabled radio or wireless network adapter


Misconfigured wireless client utility


Microsoft Windows 7 AutoConfig service or the Windows XP Wireless Zero Configu-
ration (WZC) not running or not configured


Protective supplicants (wireless client device side) that can disable the radio in response 
to specific policy violations
A disabled radio or client adapter in a wireless client device can cause a lack of connec-
tivity. Many devices, such as notebook computers, have physical switches or a combination 
of keys that can disable a radio. In many cases, a user does not even realize they turned off 
the physical switch for the wireless LAN radio. A disabled radio cannot provide RF com-
munication between the client device and the wireless infrastructure, such as an access 
point. Figure 12.4 shows the icon for a disabled wireless adapter and the window explain-
ing that the Microsoft WZC service is not started on a notebook computer with Microsoft 
Windows XP.
With the newer Microsoft Windows 7 operating system there are built-in diagnostics 
and troubleshooting that may help with some wireless LAN connectivity issues. Figure 12.5

Wireless LAN Connectivity—Coverage and Capacity Problems

 shows the wireless connection dialog box as “Not connected.” If you click the 
Troubleshoot link, Windows 7 will go through a series of steps to try to resolve the issue. 
In this case the Windows wireless service was not running, and Microsoft was able to 
determine this and identiﬁ ed the problem.
If a client utility is misconﬁ gured—for example, an incorrect SSID is speciﬁ ed—it would 
cause a lack of connectivity for the wireless client device. Client utilities have the capabil-
ity to specify the SSID as a parameter. If the client does not see an access point with the 
speciﬁ ed SSID, it will not be able to connect to the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN. This feature 
in a client device is often set by a selection to connect to a preferred SSID only by using a 
speciﬁ c proﬁ le.
Remember that the service set identifier (SSID) is case-sensitive and has a 
maximum length of 32 characters or 32 octets as defined in the IEEE 802.11 
standard. Incorrect use of case in the SSID can lead to a lack of connectiv-
ity, because the SSID will not match. Uppercase and lowercase letters are 
different ASCII characters. This can also lead to unnecessary help desk 
calls. Client devices will not connect to the wireless LAN if they have an 
incorrect SSID specified in the wireless client utility profile. This could be 
unintentional (accidental) or in some cases intentional, such as for the pur-
pose of getting around a firewall or other SSID restriction.

The Windows built-in wireless client utility is a popular client utility for connecting 
to IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. The Windows wireless service (Microsoft Windows 7 
AutoConﬁ g service or Wireless Zero Conﬁ guration [WZC] for Windows XP) runs as a 
service or background process in the Microsoft Windows operating systems. If this service 
is not running or if the client device is not conﬁ gured correctly to use Windows wireless 
services, the wireless client device will not be able to connect to the wireless network unless 
a third-party client utility from the adapter manufacturer is used. Figure 12.6 illustrates 
some of these potential issues from a wireless client device that may cause a lack of connec-
tivity to the wireless network infrastructure.
Other Wireless Connectivity Issues
Connectivity issues can also arise if a misconﬁ gured client utility has incorrect wireless 
LAN security settings or client IP address issues. Both will prevent a wireless client device 
from successfully completing the connection process and will prevent the transfer of com-
puter data. Even though the Physical layer (Layer 1) and Data Link layer (Layer 2) connec-
tion may have been successful, the Layer 3 process would not be complete, and therefore 
data would not be transferred.

Before we discuss incorrect security settings further, it is important to have a better 
understanding of how an IP address (a logical address for a network interface) may have an 
impact on a successful connection and some of the issues associated with TCP/IP.
IP Address Connectivity Issues
Although wireless networks operate at Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model, Layer 3 and 
IP addressing also play a role because TCP/IP is used in most of today’s computer networks. 
(Feel free to refer back to the discussion of the seven layers of the OSI model in Chapter 
1.) Not long ago computer networks used various proprietary protocols to communicate 
with one another, such as Novell’s IPX/SPX or Microsoft’s NetBEUI. (A protocol is a set of 
rules that deﬁ nes data communication between devices.) With the growth of local area net-
works, expanding to wide area networks and the World Wide Web (WWW) service, TCP/
IP has become the standard protocol used in virtually all computer networks. Remember 
that Layer 3 and Layer 4 of the OSI model are responsible for addressing and routing both 
information and the session connection using the TCP/IP protocol. Figure 12.7 illustrates 
the two layers responsible for the TCP/IP protocol and the function of each. 
Misconﬁ gured IP address information can cause connectivity issues in an IEEE 802.11 
wireless LAN. Most wireless networks, both SOHO and enterprise, have the capability 
to use Dynamic Host Conﬁ guration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP is a service that issues IP 
addresses and other TCP/IP parameters to connected computer network client devices. This 
service eliminates the need to manually assign logical Layer 3 IP addresses to all devices on 
the network. In IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, this DHCP service is provided directly 
from an access point, a wireless router, and a wireless LAN controller or from a server 
running DHCP services on the wired LAN. Many client device issues related to Layer 3 or 

462 
Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
above can cause failure to obtain a valid IP address. But this problem is often blamed on 
the wireless network even though a successful IEEE 802.11 authentication and association 
have occurred. Figure 12.8 shows an example of DHCP services using a wireless residential 
gateway/router.
F I G U R E 12 .7  Layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model are responsible for the addressing and

A cable or digital subscriber line (DSL) modem device connected to the ISP service will 
receive a DHCP address from the ISP. This modem will then issue IP addresses to wireless 
client devices or intermediary devices such as the IEEE 802.11 wireless router. If DHCP 
services are not running or are not operating correctly on the wireless router, the connected 
wireless client devices will not be able to obtain a valid IP address and will not be able to 
communicate above Layer 2.

Wireless LAN Connectivity—Coverage and Capacity Problems
463
The computer operating system in use will determine what action the client device 
takes if an IP address cannot be obtained from a DHCP server. Windows uses a service 
that became available starting way back with Windows 98 and is now available in all ver-
sions of Windows, called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). APIPA is designed to 
provide an IP address automatically to any computer network device requesting one that 
is connected to a common LAN. APIPA does not require the use of a DHCP server. It also 
eliminates the need for users to manually set up IP addressing on all the devices. An APIPA 
address will be in the 169.254.X.X range. For example, a device such as a notebook com-
puter may have an APIPA such as 169.254.100.20. If DHCP services are running on the 
LAN and a device cannot obtain an address from the server, or if DHCP services are not 
available, an APIPA will be issued. Figure 12.9 shows the ipconfig command displaying 
an IP address from Microsoft’s APIPA.
F I G U R E  12 . 9   Microsoft Windows APIPA
If a wireless access point or wireless router is connected to an IP subnet other than the 
one that uses automatic addresses, the wireless client device will require a valid IP address 
from the DHCP service in order to complete a network connection. If a valid IP address 
cannot be obtained from the DHCP service, the client will not have a valid TCP/IP connec-
tion to the access point or wireless router and instead will obtain an IP address from the 
169.254.X.X range. This was much easier to identify in the Windows XP operating system. 
If this is the case, the wireless connection icon will show a “Limited or no connectivity” 
message and exclamation point, as shown in Figure 12.10.

With the newer Windows 7 operating system you would need to look a little further to 
make the determination, as shown in Figure 12.11.

It is always a good idea to simply restart the wireless client network 
adapter, which will often correct some wireless client device connec-
tivity issues.
Wireless Security Settings
Incorrect security settings can also cause connectivity issues. Although you may get a physi-
cal Layer 2 wireless connection to the access point even with incorrect security settings on 
a wireless client device, you will not get a valid Layer 3 TCP/IP address from the DHCP 
server. For example, assume an access point is using WPA 2.0 personal mode for security. 
If a wireless client device has the wrong passphrase or preshared key entered, it will not 
complete the additional authentication that occurs after the IEEE 802.11 authentication 
and association process and will not have a valid Layer 3 TCP/IP address. In this case with 
the Windows XP operating system, the network adapter would stay in the “Acquiring 
network address” state; it would not be able to complete the Layer 2 connection process 
and would not receive a valid Layer 3 IP address. In the Windows 7 operating system the 
network adapter would show “Attempting to authenticate” in the network adapter status.

Intermittent Wireless Connectivity Problems
Intermittent problems of any type are often the most difﬁ cult to diagnose and repair. You 
may have had the experience of an intermittent problem with your car. For example, at a 
stoplight the car may start to idle roughly and stall. There is not really any rhyme or reason 
as to when this happens—it could be in the morning; it could be in the afternoon. You take 
your car to the mechanic for repair and of course the problem does not occur. Therefore the 
mechanic may have to keep your car for a period of time to try to duplicate the problem.
Intermittent problems with computers and networking are no different—they are dif-
ﬁ cult to diagnose if they can’t be reliably reproduced. In many cases using a protocol ana-
lyzer to capture frames is invaluable. Frame traces will allow you to see what is happening 
between the wireless transmitter and the receiver. You learned about protocol analyzers for 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks and their use in Chapter 11, “Performing an RF Wireless 
LAN Site Survey.”
Most intermittent connectivity issues in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs are associated with 
the amount of received signal strength. If nothing else has changed (for example, a security 
setting or any type of device upgrade) and the wireless client device was working before, 
there is a good possibility the problem is associated with the amount of received signal.
Understanding the Received Signal Strength
One of the main concerns associated with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking is how much 
of the transmitted signal is identiﬁ ed as usable signal by the wireless client device. As men-
tioned in Chapter 11, this is known as the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value. 
RSSI is an arbitrary number assigned by the device manufacturer. There is no standard 
for this value, and it will not be comparable between devices from different manufactur-
ers. The calculation of the RSSI value is done in a proprietary manner, and a wireless 

466 
Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
device from one manufacturer may indicate a different received signal strength than that 
indicated by another, even though they both are receiving the exact same signal and at the 
same actual signal strength. This value is a key determinant of how well the wireless LAN 
device will perform. How the device is used with the network will determine the required 
levels of signal for optimal connectivity. Two wireless LAN client devices that are equal 
distance from the access point may display different RSSI values. Some client software utili-
ties display this information in signal level bars to represent the amount of signal received. 
The more bars, the better the signal, whereas others may show the value in dBm. Wireless 
network engineers and support personnel should be able to know what the bars or numbers 
reveal and what they do not. 
The actual recommended signal strength will vary based on the manufacturer, but 
some general numbers do exist. For example, in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, in order to get the 
maximum data rate, and depending on the application (either voice or data), some manu-
facturers recommend a range of –65 dBm to –67 dBm of received signal strength. Keep in 
mind, the closer the number is to zero, the better the received signal, and –65 dBm is closer 
to zero than –67 dBm. Figure 12.13 shows an example of an access point with an output 
power of 100 mW and the wireless client receiving a fraction of that amount, or 0.000001 
mW. Although the wireless client device is receiving only a fraction of the transmitted 
power output, it is still able to move data at the highest data rate. Amazing!

Testing the Received Signal Strength
So what does this mean? It means the lower the amount of radio frequency signal that is 
received by the receiver, the lower the data rate will be. As mentioned in Chapter 11, several 
tools are available that will allow a technical support specialist to see the received signal 
strength. These tools include:

InSSIDer (free download)


NetStumbler (free download)

Wireless network adapter client utilities 


Spectrum analyzer utility
Any of these tools can be used to check the received signal strength by a wireless client 
device or at an end user’s location to determine how much signal is being received, which 
will relate to the rate they should be transferring computer data.
Figure 12.14 shows the Windows wireless service utility with bars representing the 
amount of received signal strength and the current data transfer rate.
The Windows Wireless client does not contain any specialized utilities 
that show signal strength or signal-to-noise ratio values. However, this 
utility will display bar values representing the received signal strength.

Weak, Low, or No Radio Frequency Signal
Weak, low, or no radio frequency signal is typically an indication that the wireless LAN 
client device is too far away from a wireless access point or it is experiencing some level 
of RF interference. This could also be the result of some obstruction either blocking or 
severely attenuating the radio frequency signal. This is most often the result of a poor or 
nonexistent wireless LAN site survey or signiﬁ cant environmental changes. You learned 
about performing a wireless LAN site survey in Chapter 11. In order for a client device to 
operate correctly, the signal will need to be strong enough to connect to an access point and 
maintain the connection. A wireless client device will have a difﬁ cult time distinguishing 
between the RF signal and the RF noise if the signal level is too close to the noise ﬂ oor.
To review, the signal-to-noise ratio is the difference between the amount of received sig-
nal and the noise ﬂ oor level in the area where the wireless client device is located. Chapter 
11 discussed the noise ﬂ oor and signal-to-noise ratio in more detail. Figure 12.15 shows the 
Windows 7 wireless utility and several wireless access points in the vicinity. Notice that the 
client device shows different received signal levels for the access points, as indicated by each 
one’s number of bars. The Guest and CWTS SSIDs show a high received signal, but Data 
and Voice show only two bars, which represents lower received signal strength.

Other wireless client utilities may show a more elaborate view of the signal strength and 
the noise level in an area. These are represented by dBm values rather than bar levels. In

addition to client utilities, third-party utilities such as NetStumbler or InSSIDer will show 
received signal strength or noise levels, or possibly both.
Wireless LAN Throughput
Papa User says, “Someone’s been taking my throughput!” Mama User says, “Someone’s 
been taking my throughput!” Baby User says, “Someone’s been taking my throughput and 
that someone still is!” Sound familiar? Receiving and maintaining enough throughput can 
be a tough chore in today’s world of IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. Users just can’t 
seem to have enough.
It is important to understand the difference between data rate and throughput. 
Throughput is the rate at which data is being transferred. It seems there is never enough to 
go around. When it comes to throughput, expectations are a key factor. It is important for 
users to realize that the actual throughput will always be lower than the advertised data 
rate. For example, in an IEEE 802.11n MIMO network the maximum data rate is theoreti-
cally 600 Mbps, but the actual throughput will be between 30 and 120 Mbps, much less 
than half of the advertised data rate. Keep in mind that these numbers will vary based on 
many factors, including the environment and the IEEE 802.11n technology features that 
are enabled.
Maximizing throughput is part of overall network design. A well-designed wireless LAN 
and site survey will yield excellent results. However, several factors may affect the through-
put the users are receiving, including these:


The wireless client device distance from an access point


The radio frequency transmit output power of an access point


The number of wireless devices associated to the access point
The Wireless Client Device Distance from an Access Point
As we discussed earlier, as the wireless client’s distance from an access point increases, 
the radio frequency received signal strength will decrease, thereby providing less average 
overall throughput. The type of wireless client device in use—computer, VoIP handset, 
handheld device, tablet, or barcode scanner—will determine the acceptable levels of data 
throughput. Most wireless client utilities will show that the expected data rate is based on 
the received signal strength. It is important to remember that the expected data rate is not 
actual throughput. Figure 12.16 illustrates this point by showing two different throughput 
sessions, both connected to the same access point. Session 1 is in close proximity, about 
15 to 20 feet from the access point. Session 2 shows the throughput at a greater distance, 
about 45 feet from the access point.

The Radio Frequency Transmit Output Power of an Access Point
The amount of radio frequency transmit output power being sent from the wireless access 
point will also determine RF signal strength for the connected wireless client devices. This 

Wireless LAN Connectivity—Coverage and Capacity Problems
471
is because the higher the RF power, the farther an RF signal will travel or propagate. If a 
wireless client device is receiving a low RF signal and adding an additional access point is 
not an option, increasing the output power of the access point may do the trick. However, 
keep in mind that this needs to be evaluated closely.
If a physical wireless RF site survey is performed, I recommend that you have the access 
points set to less than the full available transmit output power. What the transmit output 
power level is set to during a site survey will depend on the engineer who performs the sur-
vey or the manufacturer recommendations. If an access point is not set to full power, it will 
be possible to make adjustments to compensate and potentially correct problems such as a 
wireless client device experiencing low throughput because of a low received signal strength 
value.
The Number of Wireless Devices Associated to the Access Point
Because wireless LANs use the air as a shared medium, the more wireless client devices 
that associate to the wireless access point, the less throughput each device will be able 
to receive. The type of hardware can also affect the throughput based on the number of 
associated users. For example, if 25 users are associated to an access point using wireless 
barcode scanners that typically transfer small amounts of information, they may have bet-
ter performance than 5 users using bandwidth-intensive applications such as CAD/CAM 
on notebook computers. Load balancing of devices between access points can help limit the 
number of associated wireless client devices. Co-channel interference can cause the same 
issue, because wireless devices on the same or a close channel, associated or not, are part of 
the same contention domain.
Solutions to Low Wireless LAN Throughput
There are several possible solutions to low throughput problems clients may be experienc-
ing. The appropriate solution will depend on the speciﬁ c situation. If an RF site survey was 
performed correctly and thoroughly, additional access points should not be needed unless 
there have been environmental or capacity changes in the area since the original survey was 
performed. Solutions to low-throughput problems include the following:


Adding more access points


Increasing output power of access points


Increasing antenna gain


Enabling load-balancing solutions on access points
One or more of these solutions may help increase the throughput for users connected to 
a wireless network. Figure 12.17 shows a before-and-after scenario based on output power 
of an access point.
Of the solutions just discussed, none is always better than the others. Which solution 
you choose is going to depend on several factors, including the number of wireless client 
devices, the number of access points, budget constraints, and potential interference issues.

472 
Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
F I G U R E  12 .17   Increasing the output power of an access point will provide higher 
received signal strength for the client, resulting in better overall throughput.

Keep in mind that increasing the output power of an access point 
will also increase the cell size and potentially allow for more wire-
less client devices to associate. This will in turn increase the load or 
number of associated devices on the access point and may contribute 
to interference in other areas. It may also lead to an increase in the 
hidden node problem (discussed later in this chapter). More power is 
not always a good choice. If the budget allows, adding more access 
points as needed to reduce collision domain size (RF cell) is usually a 
better solution.
Application Performance Problems
As you now know, IEEE 802.11 wireless networks are a major part of every computer 
network in all industries and homes. Many different types of applications, both software 
and hardware, want to take advantage of the wireless network capabilities. Therefore it is 
important to understand the various types of applications your IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN

may use and how to prevent problems that can arise from the use of these applications. 
Some of the common applications that are used via wireless LANs are:


Application servers for user software, such as word processing


Databases


Engineering applications, such as computer-aided design


File servers for storing data


Barcode scanners


Printers


Voice handsets
This is not a complete list, but for the most part every resource or application that is 
used in the wired network is also a candidate for the wireless network. Many of the prob-
lems that you experience with a wired network will be even more common on a wireless 
network. We have all the same potential problems as we do in a wired network, but more 
because it is wireless. Remember that IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs use a shared medium 
(the air) and are contention based, which will create both interference and capacity prob-
lems. Using the appropriate tools such as a wireless packet analyzer and radio frequency 
spectrum analyzer will help to identify and resolve these problems. The following sections 
describe how to identify and resolve these problems.
Wireless Device Software and Hardware Upgrades
Software and hardware upgrades play a role in the maintenance and support of any wire-
less LAN deployment. Having the latest device drivers or software client utilities will help 
improve performance and solve problems associated with software-related issues. Firmware 
also needs to be updated periodically to ensure the latest and greatest ﬁ xes, and new fea-
tures are applied to the devices such as access points or wireless LAN controllers.
Client Device Software Upgrades
Upgrading the software related to wireless LAN technology has many beneﬁ ts that may 
help resolve performance or operation issues. Technical support or network engineers 
should ﬁ nd time to stay up-to-date with the latest software versions available for the 
hardware in their network. This can be done by looking at the manufacturer’s website or 
subscribing to a service that will announce changes and updates. Software upgrades for 
wireless networks commonly fall under three areas:


Device drivers


Client device adapter utilities


Device firmware
Software upgrades on any of these components will help enhance the performance of 
the client devices. These upgrades can come as a ﬁ x for a problem with the software or 
potentially provide new features for a client device. In Chapter 4, “Wireless LAN Client 

474

Devices,” you learned about some of the software components required that will enable a 
client device to connect to an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. This section focuses on the 
process of upgrading the software associated with these devices.
Device Drivers
Device drivers are the software components that allow a hardware device to function with 
a computer operating system. This is accomplished by the software providing an instruc-
tion set for all devices that connect to a computer, tablet, handheld, or any other device 
that runs with an operating system. The following list is a sampling of the devices that will 
require a software device driver:


Hard drive


Video card


Keyboard


Mouse


USB ports

Network adapters
With wireless networking, the device driver that is of most concern is the one used for 
the wireless network adapter. This adapter is what allows a computer or other client device 
to connect to a wireless network in either infrastructure or ad hoc mode. Figure 12.18 
shows an example of viewing the device driver properties for a wireless network adapter in 
the Windows 7 operating system.

In addition to causing intermittent connectivity problems, device drivers may become 
corrupt and prevent the device from starting up correctly. They can even cause operating 
system startup problems. With today’s sophisticated computer operating systems and fea-
tures, such as plug-and-play, having to worry about the physical settings of a device is less 
common than it was a few years ago. Upgrading or replacing a device driver in Windows 
operating systems is a fairly straightforward process. Exercise 12.1 will step you through 
upgrading a device driver for your wireless network adapter.
E X E R C I S E  1 2 .1
Upgrading a Device Driver
In this exercise, we will look at the process of upgrading a device driver for a wire-
less network adapter. This process is based on using the Broadcom 802.11g Net-
work Adapter.
Downloading a Driver Package from a Website
1. With the help of a web browser, connect to the appropriate website to search 
for the latest version of the device driver, in this case www.broadcom.com.
2. In most cases, you will look for either a Support or Downloads link to ﬁ nd the loca-
tion for software such as drivers. The current link on this site is Downloads & Sup-
port. Click the appropriate link.
3. You should be able to search by model number for the driver you will need. Down-
load the correct device driver. This may come in the form of an individual ﬁ le or pos-
sibly an entire software client utility program.
4. In this case, an update for this wireless adapter is not available from the 
adapter manufacturer, and because the adapter is integrated into a notebook 
computer, it will be necessary to visit the website for the computer in which 
this adapter is installed. It is important to note that for client devices with 
integrated adapters it is best to visit the website of the manufacturer for the device. 
In this case, the website is www.lenovo.com.
5. This website has links for support and downloads. Click the Support and Downloads 
links (http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/).
6. Browse for the correct driver based on the installed adapter.
7. 
In this case, you will have to download an entire package. This one is approximately 
78 Mb. Run the downloaded program to install the latest device driver ﬁ le.
Manually Upgrading a Driver
These next steps show how you would manually upgrade a device driver using an 
individual ﬁ le:

4. Select the Driver tab and then click the Update Driver button. The Hardware Update 
Wizard launches. Select the Install From A List Or Speciﬁ c Location (Advanced) radio 
button. A new screen (called Please choose your search and installation options) 
appears.
5. Click the Don’t Search, I Will Choose The Driver To Install radio button. Then 
click Next.
6. Click the Have Disk button and browse to the folder where the driver is located. 
Select the driver, and then click Open. At the Install From Disk screen, click OK. 
The Select Network Adapter screen appears.
7. 
Click Next to continue. The update will process. Click Finish to complete the device 
driver upgrade.
Automatically Upgrading a Driver
Some manufacturers are making it easy to upgrade a device driver for your wireless net-
work adapters. They do this by creating an executable program that does everything for 
you automatically. All you need to do is download a ﬁ le from the manufacturer’s website 
and execute the program. Everything from that point is automatic.
Client Device Adapter Utilities
Client adapter utilities may need to be upgraded occasionally. By upgrading the client 
adapter utility, you will usually add new features or settings to enhance the performance 
and function of the utility.
The Windows wireless utility is usually upgraded either from a service pack or a hotﬁ x 
available from the Microsoft website.

Device Firmware
Device ﬁ rmware is the instruction set that allows hardware to operate based on its 
design. Firmware is simply software that remains in memory when the power is removed. 
Firmware tends to be hardware oriented, but not all ﬁ rmware involves the control of hard-
ware. Many Layer 7 user interfaces and agents are implemented as ﬁ rmware burned into 
read-only memory devices (ROMs). 
Conversely, there are many examples of software directly controlling hardware. Most 
drivers for hardware devices are software (loaded into volatile memory only when power is 
present) and not ﬁ rmware (always resident in static memory regardless of power). Firmware 
upgrades are common support tasks that need to be done periodically, either to ﬁ x issues 
with the way the hardware is operating or to provide new features for the hardware. 
All infrastructure devices, either SOHO-grade or enterprise-grade, allow you to upgrade the 
ﬁ rmware. In enterprise environments, ﬁ rmware upgrades can be performed either manually or 
automatically with the aid of a wireless LAN management system software or appliance.
Many manufacturers of enterprise-grade equipment require you to pur-
chase a support contact or service agreement in order to download 
firmware for wireless infrastructure devices.
Most infrastructure devices have several options for performing upgrades. These 
upgrade options include:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)


Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)

File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Figure 12.19 shows an example of a graphical user interface (GUI) screen where a ﬁ rm-
ware update is being processed.
Upgrading Firmware Warning
It is imperative to follow the manufacturer’s instructions when performing a ﬁ rm-
ware upgrade. Failure to do so may result in the device becoming unusable or 
needing to be returned to the manufacturer for repair. Several items are very 
important when you are performing a ﬁ rmware upgrade on any device:


Always verify that you have the correct ﬁ rmware ﬁ le for the device to be 
upgraded prior to performing the upgrade.

Always read the release notes that come with the ﬁ rmware.


Never upgrade ﬁ rmware on a device that is running on battery power.

Never power down the device while the ﬁ rmware upgrade is in process.

The ﬁ rmware in enterprise-grade access points and wireless controllers can usually be 
upgraded using the command-line interface instead of the GUI if desired.
Wireless Infrastructure and Client Device Hardware Upgrades
There may be various reasons to upgrade hardware for both infrastructure and client-side 
devices. Hardware upgrades are a part of the ongoing maintenance process with all net-
working devices, including wireless LANs.
Wireless Infrastructure Devices
Upgrading wireless infrastructure devices can be an expensive and time-consuming task. 
Justifying these infrastructure device upgrades may require preparing reports that include 
performance of the wireless LAN infrastructure and client devices as well as documenta-
tion that shows how an upgrade will enhance the end-user performance and make users 
more productive in their job functions.
Upgrading wireless infrastructure devices such as access points can give an organization 
the ability to enhance the performance of the wireless network by increasing the speed or 
reliability of the wireless LAN. The hardware currently in use helps determine the extent 
of an upgrade. Some upgrades may only require the installation of a new or additional 
radio. Some access points are modular and provide this capability. One example of a wire-
less infrastructure upgrade is moving from IEEE 802.11b/g to IEEE 802.11n and MIMO 
technology. 

480
Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
Antennas
Unless the physical characteristics of the area where the wireless LAN is deployed have 
changed since the site survey, chances are that antennas will not need to be upgraded. If 
characteristics such as additional walls or types of furnishings or other physical attributes 
have changed, antennas with different propagation patterns or higher gain may be required. 
Another situation where antennas may need to be upgraded or changed is if the initial site 
survey was not performed thoroughly or correctly. In some cases where external antennas 
are used on an access point, they may have been struck and accidentally moved, changing 
the polarity. A physical inspection of the deployed infrastructure devices should be part of 
routine wireless LAN administration or support to locate and correct such issues.
Wireless Client Device Upgrades
Client device upgrades can be automatic if the technology refresh for devices has taken 
place. For example, if a company replaces 50 notebook computers with newer models, 
the new notebooks will probably have wireless LAN adapters that are capable of IEEE 
802.11a/b/g/n. The capabilities of these new notebooks may be more advanced than the 
wireless infrastructure that is currently deployed.
Another situation where wireless client devices may need upgrading is one in which the 
infrastructure changes to different hardware or technology. If a company upgrades access 
points from IEEE 802.11b/g to IEEE 802.11n and the clients only support 802.11b/g, the 
client devices may need to be upgraded in order to take full advantage of the new IEEE 
802.11n wireless infrastructure.
Optimizing Wireless Networks
Making changes to an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN installation may be required in order 
to provide optimal performance for the devices that will be connecting. In some cases, a 
wireless LAN site survey is considered an ongoing process due to the dynamics of radio 
frequency and changes in technology. This being the case, an existing wireless LAN deploy-
ment may have to be resurveyed to provide optimal performance for the users. Here are 
some of the factors that you need to consider when optimizing a wireless LAN:


Wireless infrastructure hardware selection and placement


Radio frequency interference sources


Client device load balancing


Access point capacity and utilization


Minimizing multipath


Understanding hidden node problems

Optimizing Wireless Networks
481
Wireless Infrastructure Hardware Selection and 
Placement
Wireless infrastructure hardware selection and placement are typically part of the 
wireless LAN site survey process. However, occasionally you may need to reevaluate 
after the wireless LAN has been installed. Although the objective of a site survey is to 
design the network, ﬁ nd locations and sources of interference, and decide on locations 
for infrastructure devices, you may have to make some adjustments to allow for optimal 
performance. These adjustments may include minor relocation of access points as well 
as radio frequency adjustments, including channel and output power settings. These 
adjustments would ensure that clients have maximum signal strength, throughput, 
and roaming capabilities. Applications—both hardware and software—and user 
requirements could also change, requiring an optimization or resurvey of the wireless 
network.
Identifying, Locating, and Removing Sources of Wi-Fi 
and Non-Wi-Fi Interference
In Chapter 11, we discussed how to identify areas of radio frequency coverage and Wi-Fi 
and non-Wi-Fi interference. This usually is part of the wireless LAN site survey process. 
The best way to identify sources of interference is with a spectrum analyzer. This could be 
in the form of an instrumentation device or a PC card–based spectrum analyzer designed 
speciﬁ cally for wireless networking.
During this wireless site survey process, interference sources should be identiﬁ ed. 
However, changes to the environment may introduce new sources of RF interference. Also, 
keep in mind that a walkthrough spectrum analysis of an area will only record the RF it 
sees at that instant in time. If a new piece of equipment is introduced into an area, it may 
cause interference with the wireless network that would not have been present during the 
RF site survey spectrum analysis process. Businesses or organizations that use wireless 
LANs where this could be a factor include:


Healthcare deployments


Warehouse/retail deployments


Manufacturing deployments


Industrial deployments
Therefore, an ongoing spectrum analysis may be required to identify and if pos-
sible remove the sources of interference. If these new sources of interference are there to 
stay, it will be necessary to make appropriate adjustments for the network to operate as 
designed. The number one source of interference in a wireless network is other wireless 
devices.

482 
Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
Newer access points contain spectrum analysis capabilities integrated 
with the access point. This allows an administrator or network engi-
neer to connect to the access point and view the radio frequency in 
the area without having to visit the location.
Figure 12.20 shows an example of a PC card spectrum analyzer that can be used to 
perform a spectrum analysis to help locate new sources of RF interference after a wireless 
LAN has been deployed.

Wireless Client Device Load Balancing and Infrastructure 
Device Redundancy
Client load balancing is a mechanism that prevents wireless client devices from associat-
ing to an access point that has already reached the maximum number of client devices 
for optimal performance. There are a variety of ways this can be accomplished, typically 
proprietary to the manufacturer. Parameters for load balancing can be set on the access 
points, wireless LAN management software, or wireless LAN controllers. Load balancing 
will allow optimal use of all access points in a speciﬁ c area by preventing too many devices 
from connecting to a single access point and overloading the access point, which in turn 
would cause poor performance for all associated devices. Band steering in now implemented 
by many wireless equipment manufacturers. Band steering will attempt to get wireless cli-
ent devices that are 5 GHz capable to use the 5 GHz band rather than the 2.4 GHz band.  
Figure 12.21 illustrates the load-balancing process for wireless LAN access points.

The ways in which load balancing is implemented depend on the manufacturer of the 
wireless LAN equipment. One solution is a settable parameter in an access point specifying 
a maximum number of devices allowed to connect at any one time. Once the access point 
has reached its capacity, a client device wanting to associate will be presented with an error 
message and will not be allowed to complete the process. Some manufacturers will direct 
the wireless client device to an access point that will be able to accept the connection rather 
than deny the connection.
Wireless Infrastructure Device Redundancy
Designing for wireless LAN redundancy is an important factor in most enterprise wireless 
LAN deployments. In both wireless LAN controller-based implementations and wireless 
access points implementations, it is critical to eliminate any potential single point of failure 
in the wireless LAN.

484
Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
Wireless LAN Controller Redundancy  If you were to have only a single wireless 
LAN controller and that controller failed, the entire wireless network would be down 
for any controller-based access point. Therefore a redundant controller should be con-
sidered to eliminate the single point of failure. Some manufacturers offer zero license 
controllers at a decent price that would only be used in the event of a wireless infrastruc-
ture controller failure. For example, if you have 24 controller-based access points, that 
would require 24 access point licenses. You would have two controllers of 24 ports each 
for a total of 48 ports. However, this would only allow for 24 licensed access points to 
be used at any one time. The second zero license controller would be for failover 
purposes only.
Autonomous or Cooperative Access Point Redundancy  As you learned in Chapter 3, 
“Wireless LAN Infrastructure Devices,” autonomous and cooperative access points do 
not require a wireless LAN controller to operate. An autonomous access point operates as 
a standalone device, requiring each device to be managed individually or with the help of 
wireless LAN management software solutions. Cooperative access points are cloud based 
and do not require the use of a wireless LAN controller, as they have their own manage-
ment software that does not rely on a dedicated controller. If one of these access points was 
to fail, only those wireless client devices that were part of that basic service area might lose 
a connection to the network. 
Depending on the design of the wireless LAN, the surrounding autonomous or coopera-
tive access points may be able to increase their radio frequency power to compensate for 
the failed access point, allowing the wireless client devices that were connected to it to still 
maintain a connection to the network. This should only be a temporary solution, and the 
failed access point should be replaced immediately. In a single-access-point installation, 
if the access point did fail that would be a single point of failure. For both enterprise and 
SOHO deployments I recommend a spare access point be kept on hand in the event of a 
failure.
Analyzing Wireless Infrastructure Capacity and 
Utilization
It is important to have a baseline for the performance of your wireless LAN. This baseline 
will show the average utilization and capacity of the connected infrastructure devices at 
various times during the company’s business hours. Continuous monitoring of the wire-
less network is similar to that of a wired network. Performance metrics will be needed to 
gauge the use of the wireless LAN and infrastructure devices and show how well the system 
performs. These metrics will also show areas that are lacking in performance, including 
bottlenecks or overutilized access points. Using these performance metrics will show which 
infrastructure devices need attention. This may include moving or adding access points for 
additional capacity or to allow for higher utilization. Changes to the environment, such as 
the addition of users, may justify the need for additional access points.

Optimizing Wireless Networks 
485
Using IEEE 802.11e or WMM-compliant devices combined with the cor-
responding QoS settings can improve overall performance in such an 
environment.
Radio Frequency Performance Problems: Multipath
With IEEE 802.11 a/b/g systems, poor throughput can be the result of corrupted data, 
which may be caused by multipath. Multipath is various radio frequency wavefronts of the 
same signal being received at slightly different times. Multipath is caused by RF reﬂ ections 
based on the physical attributes where an access point is placed. As discussed in Chapter 7, 
“Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories,” antenna diversity will help minimize the prob-
lems for IEEE 802.11a/b/g systems caused by multipath.
It is important to understand that although multipath is a hindrance in most IEEE 
802.11a/b/g wireless LAN implementations, it is beneﬁ cial for IEEE 802.11n systems. 
MIMO technology used with 802.11n is designed to take advantage of multipath and 
increase throughput by using the effects of multipath as an advantage. You learned in 
Chapter 5, “Physical Layer Access Methods and Spread-Spectrum Technology,” that unlike 
IEEE 802.11a/b/g SISO systems, IEEE 802.11n MIMO access points use multiple radios 
with multiple antennas. The multiple radio chains and some additional intelligence are 
what give 802.11n MIMO access points the capability to process reﬂ ected signals. Since 
MIMO works with both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII bands, a dual-band IEEE 
802.11n MIMO access point will have up to six radio chains—three for 2.4 GHz and three 
for 5 GHz—and six antennas (one for each radio) for data rates of up to 450 Mbps. IEEE 
802.11n MIMO technology allows for up to four radio chains, which in turn would pro-
vide up to 600 Mbps. However, very few manufacturers are providing four radio chains.
If you are experiencing performance problems where multipath may be a potential issue, 
you will need to evaluate your environment to determine if this is contributing to the issues. 
Using the proper diversity technology for IEEE 802.11a/b/g systems and upgrading to IEEE 
802.11n systems are some of the options. If you are using diversity-capable access points 
with integrated antennas, spacing between antennas will be correct. If you are using exter-
nal antennas, keep in mind that the spacing between the antennas should be in multiples of 
the wavelength for the frequency that is used. Check with the manufacturer of the access 
points you are using to determine how diversity antennas should be installed.
Radio Frequency Performance Problems: Hidden Node
More IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN installations experience hidden node problems than you 
would probably imagine. Hidden node is the result of wireless client devices connected to 
an access point and not able to “hear” each other prior to starting a transmission. This 
will result in collisions at the access point and the loss of data. As discussed in Chapter 5, 
the CSMA/CA process is designed to avoid collisions between devices sharing the same 

486 
Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
medium. This process includes the use of a mechanism called clear channel assessment 
(CCA). CCA detects radio frequency energy from other IEEE 802.11 wireless client devices 
in the same RF space and understands that the medium is busy. Therefore, that wireless cli-
ent device will not attempt to transmit until it detects the medium is clear.
Three causes of the hidden node problem are:


Hidden node obstacle (obstructions) 


Hidden node distance (signal strength)


Hidden node technology (signaling methods)
There are both hardware solutions and software solutions to resolving hidden node prob-
lems. The following sections describe hidden node problems and solutions in more detail. 
Hidden Node Obstacle or Obstruction
Hidden node obstacle is caused by two or more client devices connecting to an access point 
in which access point–to–client device RF communication is clear but client device–to–cli-
ent device RF communication is blocked. Figure 12.22 illustrates an example of hidden 
node obstacle.

There are several physical solutions to the hidden node obstacle problem. Any of these 
solutions should allow for the correct RF communication between access points and wireless 
client devices. Some of the physical solutions to hidden node obstacle include the following:

Optimizing Wireless Networks
487
Removing the Obstacle  Removing any obstacles that do not allow for clear RF communi-
cation between client devices will solve the hidden node problem. However, in most cases 
removing obstacles is not feasible. If this type of hidden node problem does exist, a good 
reason could be poor network design or an inadequate wireless LAN site survey.
Adding Access Points  Adding more access points will help resolve issues caused by hid-
den node where obstacles are a factor. This will allow for clear RF communication between 
access points and clients as well as between client devices connected to the same access 
point. Keep in mind, however, that careful planning must be taken into consideration when 
adding access points. Too many access points or access points that are too close together 
can cause other problems, like co-channel interference. This is where a software-assisted 
wireless LAN site survey program comes in handy. You can use a program like this to 
perform a passive RF site survey by walking the area and gathering RF data. We discussed 
various manufacturers of software-assisted wireless LAN site survey programs and you 
learned about passive site surveys in Chapter 11.
Hidden Node Distance or Signal Strength
With hidden node distance or hidden node signal strength problems, client device–to–cli-
ent device RF communication cannot occur because the client devices are too far apart and 
not in radio range of each other. However, access point–to–client device RF communica-
tion does take place, because these devices are within radio range. Figure 12.23 shows an 
example of hidden node distance.

Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
Just as in hidden node obstacle problems, physical solutions exist for the hidden node 
distance problem. These physical solutions provide adequate RF communication for access 
point–to–wireless client device and for client device–to–client device. The following are 
examples of solutions for hidden node distance:
Increasing the Output Power of Client Devices  Increasing the RF output power of client 
devices allows them a larger radio range. This enables wireless client devices to hear each 
other and therefore know whether the medium is clear prior to starting a transmission.
Moving the Client Devices Closer Together  Moving the wireless client devices closer 
together allows the devices to hear the RF communication between each other. In this 
situation they are able to detect whether the RF medium is clear prior to starting a 
transmission to the access point. This is a better solution than increasing the transmit 
power.
Adding More Access Points  Another solution would be to add more access points. This 
would allow wireless client devices to detect a clear RF medium. More access points mean 
a smaller basic service area for each access point on the network. This allows client devices 
to associate with an access point in close range, and they will not be required to contend 
for the same access point with other wireless devices at a distance. As mentioned earlier, 
adding more access points needs to be carefully considered.
Hidden Node Physical Layer Technology or Signaling Methods
Hidden node technology problems occur when access points experience excessive collisions 
because of different spread spectrum or Physical layer communication technologies that are 
sharing the same RF medium. This can happen when, for example, an access point has to 
share transmissions between 802.11b (HR/DSSS) and 802.11g (ERP-OFDM) client devices. 
Figure 12.24 illustrates the hidden node problem due to different Physical layer technolo-
gies in use.
In this example the only physical solution to the hidden node technology problem is 
to allow either 802.11b or 802.11g devices to communicate with the access point but not 
both. In most cases, this is not a realistic solution, because allowing only one of the tech-
nologies to communicate with an access point prevents devices using the other technology 
from using the network. In other words, giving only 802.11g (ERP-OFDM) devices the 
capability to use the network would prevent 802.11b (HR/DSSS) devices from using the 
network resources, or vice versa. 
IEEE 802.11n, the newest communication amendment and now part of the IEEE 
802.11-2012 standard, consists of four protection modes. The same potential hidden node 
problems will exist with 802.11n devices but even more so because 802.11n is capable of 
operating in both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII bands. These modes are known as 
High Throughput (HT) protection modes and are a set of rules client devices and access 
points will use for backward compatibility. You learned in Chapter 8, “Wireless LAN 
Terminology and Technology,” that these modes are constantly changing based on the RF 
environment and associated wireless client devices.

The Software Solution to Hidden Node Problems
There is a software conﬁ guration solution for all of the hidden node problems just described. 
This software conﬁ guration solution is known as a process called request to send (RTS), clear 
to send (CTS), or RTS/CTS. The RTS/CTS process allows devices to reserve the medium for 
a speciﬁ ed period of time, enabling a device to complete a frame exchange and avoid colli-
sions. RTS/CTS frames are also used with protection mechanisms to allow different IEEE 
802.11a/b/g/n technologies to interoperate. You learned about protection mechanisms and 
Mixed Mode in Chapter 8. The RTS/CTS process was discussed brieﬂ y in Chapter 8 but is 
beyond the scope of the CWTS exam objectives and therefore is not discussed in detail.
Summary
In this chapter, we looked at troubleshooting and maintenance concerns that may involve 
wireless networking. This included identifying wireless LAN problems as both global 
(many) and isolated (individual) and the process for troubleshooting these problems. Global 
problems may include wireless infrastructure devices, such as:


Wireless access points


Wireless bridges


Wireless LAN controllers

Chapter 12  Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
Isolated problems usually include a single wireless LAN client device or computer that 
could be experiencing connectivity or data transfer issues. We also looked at basic radio 
frequency communications using a transmitter and receiver and how these devices operate 
in a wireless LAN. We examined connectivity issues, including no connectivity or weak 
connectivity, and the problems that can be associated with connectivity issues. No connec-
tivity on the client side could be something as simple as a network adapter not enabled or 
could be related to something more in depth, including:

Security configurations
In this chapter, you learned about received signal strength and the difference between a 
strong signal and a weak signal, as well as some of the reasons why a wireless client device 
may experience weak or no signal. Throughput is another area we explored that involves 
client-side performance. We discussed some of the factors that could cause low throughput 
and how to solve these issues. 
Upgrading software is another area that needs be taken into consideration with wireless 
LANs from the client side, upgrading device drivers or client software utilities, as well as 
the infrastructure side, which includes upgrading ﬁ rmware. All of these areas are important 
parts of wireless LAN maintenance and support. 
Finally, you saw how to optimize wireless networks and some of the areas that should 
be considered for this optimization, which may include making the necessary adjustments 
from the original wireless site survey. These adjustments could be a result of changes to the 
environment such as walls, doors, windows, or other physical attributes of the location. 
Other important factors include client load balancing, multipath, and hidden node issues.

with early IEEE 802.3 networks. The ring topology is rarely used with LANs today but 
is still widely used by Internet service providers (ISPs) for high-speed, resilient backhaul 
connections over ﬁ ber-optic links. In a mesh topology, each device in the mesh network 
has one or more connections to other devices. The star topology consists of multiple 
devices connected by a central connection device and is the most commonly used 
method of connecting devices on a LAN today.

14. B. Obstacles affect the RF line of sight. Phase and amplitude are characteristics of 
radio frequency, and interference affects the throughput.
15. C. There are 11 channels available for wireless LAN use in the unlicensed UNII-2e 
band. The other three 5 GHz bands have only 4 channels each.
16. A. The amplitude is the height of an RF signal. The length of one cycle is the wave-
length, the shift is phase, and width is not a valid factor.
17. B. A 2.4 GHz 802.11b signal is 22 MHz wide. 25 MHz is the distance required to be 
considered nonoverlapping.
18. B. An RF signal that bounces off a smooth surface is reﬂ ection. Refraction passes 
through, diffraction bends around, and scattering bounces off a non-smooth 
surface.
19. C. The gain of an antenna is measured in dBi. This is a relative measure of power.
20. D. Diffraction passes or bends around an obstacle. Reﬂ ection bounces off a smooth 
surface, refraction passes through, and scattering bounces off an uneven surface.
Chapter 7: Wireless LAN Antennas 
and Accessories
1. 
D. Omnidirectional antennas have a horizontal beamwidth of 360°. The vertical 
beamwidth will vary depending on the design and the gain of the antenna.
2. 
B. Antennas provide an increase in RF coverage by means of passive gain. Passive gain 
occurs when isotropic RF energy is focused into a speciﬁ c radiation pattern. Active 
gain requires the use of an external power source.
3. 
A. Horizontal beamwidth is parallel to the earth’s surface. This is based on how the 
E-ﬁ eld propagates away from the antenna element. Vertical beamwidth is perpendicu-
lar to the earth’s surface.
4. 
B. An access point will require two antennas for diversity. Although there are two 
antennas, a single input/single output access point will have only one radio. The access 
point provides additional intelligence to determine which antenna to use. Other wire-
less LAN technologies such as MIMO may use up to three antennas.
5. 
B. A lightning arrestor is used to protect a wireless LAN system from an indirect light-
ning strike. A lightning arrestor will direct transient or induced electrical current to 
earth ground as a result of a lightning strike.

Chapter 7: Wireless LAN Antennas and Accessories

6. 
A. Active gain requires an external power source to provide an increase in signal 
strength. An ampliﬁ er is an example of a device that uses active gain. Antennas provide 
an increase in strength by using passive gain.
7. 
C. Highly directional antennas are typically used for long-range point-to-point con-
nectivity such as bridge links. Omnidirectional antennas are used as part of an access 
point system or to provide point-to-multipoint links.
8. 
A. Changing the orientation of a device or antenna will change the polarization and 
affect the received signal strength. The signal strength may either increase or decrease 
depending on how the polarization is changed from the original position. Wavelength, 
frequency, and phase are characteristics of radio frequency.
9. 
A, C. Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint both require RF line of sight to be able to 
effectively communicate. Scattering, reﬂ ection, and refraction are all behaviors of radio 
frequency.
10. C, D. Cables and connectors can both result in a loss of signal strength. Antennas and 
ampliﬁ ers will add gain or increase signal strength. A transmitter outputs an absolute 
amount of power.
11. A. 802.11g access points require only one antenna to function. Systems that support 
antenna diversity will require two antennas to correctly operate.
12. B. 802.11a access points can use antenna diversity. Gain and polarization are consid-
ered RF concepts.
13. A. The image is an example of an omnidirectional antenna. This type of antenna pro-
vides a horizontal radiation pattern of 360°.
14. C. Of the answers listed, wind would have the biggest impact on a wireless LAN 
system. Rain, snow, and hail do not affect wireless transmission unless the weather is 
severe. In this case, the collection of the elements may have an impact on the wireless 
LAN signal transmitted or received.
15. C. Wireless LAN cables and devices are rated at 50 ohms impedance. Cable and satel-
lite television is rated at 75 ohms.
16. B. The curvature of the earth or earth bulge will have an impact on a wireless LAN 
signal after seven miles. If the signal needs to travel farther than seven miles, the 
antenna will have to be installed in a higher location.
17. A. A patch antenna provides semidirectional coverage. The amount of coverage 
depends on the design and gain of the antenna. Parabolic dishes are highly 
directional.
18. B. The horizontal RF radiation pattern of an antenna is displayed using an azimuth 
chart. The vertical radiation pattern is displayed using an elevation chart.
19. D. It is recommended that at least 60 percent of the Fresnel zone be free of obstruc-
tion in order to have acceptable RF line of sight. Up to 40 percent of the zone can be 

508
Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
blocked by obstructions without affecting the signal.
20. D. The image shows a patch antenna. This is an example of a semidirectional antenna.
Chapter 8: Wireless LAN Terminology 
and Technology
1. 
B. When a wireless client device listens for beacons, it is performing passive scan-
ning. Active scanning is sending a probe request. Authentication occurs after the probe 
phase. Power save puts the device into a low power state.
2. 
C. Dynamic rate switching (also called dynamic rate selection) allows a wireless LAN 
device to adjust data rates based on received signal. Dynamic frequency selection 
allows an access point to pick the best frequency to operate on based on the environ-
ment. Transmit power control automatically adjusts output power. Transmit save mode 
does not exist.
3. 
A. An IBSS uses no access points and is also known as peer-to-peer or ad hoc net-
working. A BSS uses one access point.
4. 
C. If a device is part of a peer-to-peer network, it will connect to other like devices. 
An access point and a wireless switch are both infrastructure networking devices and 
will be part of either a BSS or ESS.
5. 
A. The data rate decreases as a wireless LAN device moves away from an access point. 
The data rates increase as a wireless LAN device moves closer to one access point. The 
output power does not change based on the location of the wireless device in the radio 
range of the access point.
6. 
C. An SSID can be a maximum of 32 characters or octets and is also case-sensitive.
7. 
B. If access points on the same distribution system are set with different SSIDs, the 
client will lose the connection while roaming unless all SSIDs are set in the client util-
ity. The channel is set by the access point, and the BSSID is the MAC address of the AP 
radio.
8. 
C. Beacons are management frames and are used in the passive scanning process. Data 
frames carry data payload. Control frames reserve the medium and acknowledgment 
frames. Detail frames do not exist.
9. 
B. The client must authenticate to an access point before it can associate. After both 
authentication and association have been completed, the client is considered to be part 
of the BSS.

Chapter 8: Wireless LAN Terminology and Technology
509
10. B. Moving throughout a location will cause a wireless client to roam from one access 
point to another. As part of the roaming process a client sometimes, but not always, 
needs to reauthenticate.
11. A, C. To successfully set up an ad hoc network, a user must know two parameters, 
the SSID and the RF channel it will be operating on. The BSSID is automatically gen-
erated in an ad hoc network. The BSSID is the MAC address of an AP radio; APs are 
not used in ad hoc networks. Protection mode does not apply to the situation.
12. B. Open system authentication uses two frames. The ﬁ rst frame is from the client 
to the access point and the second frame is from the access point back to the client. 
Shared-key authentication uses four frames.
13. C. In 802.11b/g and mixed mode environments, throughput will be affected because 
of ERP protection mechanisms. Association and authentication are normal frames 
exchanged and do not affect throughput. HT protection mode is for 802.11n.
14. A, C. An SSID has a maximum of 32 characters or octets. SSIDs are case-sensitive.
15. A. The BSSID is the unique identifying MAC address of the access point’s radio net-
work adapter. This abbreviation is sometimes confused with SSID, which is a network 
name. The other MAC addresses are used in networking but are not representative of 
the BSSID.
16. B. A network consisting only of wireless client stations is an independent basic service 
set (IBSS). Other terms for this type of network are ad hoc and peer-to-peer. Infra-
structure mode is a term used with a basic service set that consists of a single access 
point. Active and passive are scanning modes in which wireless devices connect to a 
wireless network.
17. C. Because the computer is almost always plugged into an AC power source, it is 
unnecessary to have the device perform power save functions. Therefore, active mode 
(sometimes referred to as continuous aware mode) is the best solution. Power save 
mode would work well for a device that is on battery power and will help extend the 
battery life. Association and passive mode do not pertain to power save.
18. A. An ESS as stated in the IEEE 802.11 standard is one or more interconnected basic 
service sets.
19. A. In order for a wireless client to become part of a basic service set, it must ﬁ rst 
authenticate and then associate. The distribution system is the network in which the 
access point is physically connected. Deauthentication and reauthentication occur 
when a client either logs off the wireless network or roams from one access point to 
another.
20. B. A BSS consists of only one access point. An IBSS has zero access points. A network 
with more than one access point would be considered an ESS.

Chapter 9: Wireless LAN 
Security Basics
1. 
A, B, E. WPA Enterprise, WEP, and MAC ﬁ ltering can all be used to secure 802.11g 
access points. PPTP is a Layer 3 security solution that consists of both tunneling and 
encryption. IPSec is a Layer 3 VPN encryption mechanism. RBAC stands for role-
based access control and is a way of restricting access to only authorized users.
2. 
A, D. Both WPA2 Personal and WEP support shared key security. The WPA2 Personal 
algorithm creates a 256-bit preshared key. WEP can be used with either a 64-bit or 
128-bit key. WPA Enterprise, 802.1X/EAP, and WPA2 Enterprise all use the 802.1X 
process to create a key.
3. 
B. Passphrases are available for use with WPA Personal or WPA2 Personal and are 
capable of providing strong security for the home user or small ofﬁ ce. SSID hiding 
should not be used for security because the SSID can be found in frames other than 
beacons. MAC ﬁ lters are considered legacy solutions and can be easily spoofed using 
software downloadable from the Internet. 128-bit WEP can be cracked very quickly 
using software tools and is therefore not a secure solution.
4. 
C. In order to provide a secure connection between your laptop and the ofﬁ ce net-
work, a Layer 3 VPN solution would be the best choice. Passphrase security and WEP 
require the access point to be conﬁ gured, and this typically is not the case in public 
hotspots. 802.1X/EAP is enterprise security and usually does not apply to public hot-
spots.
5. 
E. A MAC ﬁ lter is used to allow or deny wireless LAN devices access to a wireless 
access point. WEP is a shared key security mechanism. IPSec encryption is used in 
Layer 3 VPNs. SSIDs are used as a network name and for segmentation. RF is radio 
frequency and cannot be ﬁ ltered.
6. 
B. The IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard requires CCMP. WEP is an optional 
authentication/encryption method deﬁ ned in the original 802.11 standard. TKIP is an 
enhancement to WEP that usually was accomplished as a ﬁ rmware upgrade for older 
equipment. PPTP and VPN are both Layer 3 solutions and not deﬁ ned in any IEEE 
wireless amendment.
7. 
A. A virtual private network (VPN) is a Layer 3 security solution that provides secure 
data transmissions over a public network infrastructure such as the Internet. WEP, 
WPA, 802.1X/EAP, and WPA 2.0 are examples of Layer 2 security solutions.
8. 
A. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method used to restrict access only to autho-
rized users. RBAC assigns permissions or access to roles to which users can be added.
9. 
D. If the SSID of the wireless network is hidden, the user will need knowledge of the 
SSID in order to connect to the wireless network. The SSID broadcast is only enabled 

Chapter 9: Wireless LAN Security Basics 
511
on an access point or wireless LAN controller/switch. Getting a new password from 
the help desk will not provide the SSID of the wireless network. Entering a username 
and password is user-based authentication.
10. C. RADIUS is a centralized authentication method that is used to authenticate users 
on a wireless network. Accessing a corporate network using a modem is a function of 
remote access services. Making a call to the help desk and requesting a username and 
password is not a function of RADIUS; however, the help desk may be able to assist 
with username and password issues. Requesting remote assistance to help solve a soft-
ware problem is more related to troubleshooting and not a function of RADIUS.
11. B. In 802.1X networking, the access point is also known as the authenticator. The 
supplicant is another term for the client device, and the authentication server can be a 
RADIUS or AAA authentication source.
12. D. The original IEEE 802.11 standard identiﬁ es WEP as an optional authentication/
encryption method. AES and CCMP are addressed in the 802.11i amendment to the 
standard. TKIP is an enhancement to WEP and not identiﬁ ed in the original standard. 
EAP provides an authentication process and is used with 802.1X networks.
13. A, C. Higher levels of RF activity reported by an intrusion prevention system could 
mean an RF denial-of-service attack is underway or could be misrepresented as inter-
ference from a neighboring access point. A deauthentication storm or encryption attack 
would be identiﬁ ed differently in a wireless intrusion prevention system. A misconﬁ g-
ured client workstation would not cause this type of alert.
14. C. WEP is typically 64-bit or 128-bit encryption. The numbers 5, 10, 13, and 26 are 
related to the number of characters the WEP key can be in either ASCII or 
hexadecimal.
15. B. PIN-based security is mandatory for both access points and client devices in order 
to be considered Wi-Fi Protected Setup certiﬁ ed. PBC or push-button conﬁ guration is 
optional for client devices in this certiﬁ cation. WPA is a pre-802.11i certiﬁ cation that 
addresses TKIP and is used in either SOHO or enterprise-based wireless networks. 
Wi-Fi Protected Setup is not intended for enterprise WLAN deployments.
16. B. A wireless intrusion prevention system will automatically monitor the network for 
signatures that match potential intrusion techniques. An intrusion prevention system 
has the capability to automatically shut down a rogue access point. An intrusion detec-
tion system requires a manual shutdown. A WIPS will not notify a network adminis-
trator of a recent ﬁ rmware upgrade.
17. B. If WEP must be used on a wireless network, the devices that use WEP should be 
separated using VLANs. This will protect the rest of the network from being compro-
mised. Voice transmissions can be seen with the correct tools. CCMP/AES is available 
in newer devices that support the latest wireless security methods but is not available in 
older devices.
18. B. An intruder can spoof a MAC address in order to circumvent the MAC ﬁ lter and gain 
access to the wireless network. Encryption cracking is a different form of intrusion that 

512
Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
also could possibly allow an intruder to steal a user’s authentication credentials. An RF 
denial-of-service attack is caused by transmitting high-energy RF to prevent access to the 
wireless network.
19. C. PIN-based security is usually used with SOHO brand wireless devices that sup-
port Wi-Fi Protected Setup certiﬁ cation (WPS). The devices are typically used in small 
ofﬁ ce/home ofﬁ ce installations or by home-based users. WPA 2.0 solutions can use 
either passphrase or 802.1X/EAP.
20. A. Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) commonly uses IPSec for encryption. PPTP is 
another VPN method that uses MPPE 128-bit encryption. AES and WEP are used with 
Layer 2 802.11-based wireless networks.
Chapter 10: Wireless LAN Site 
Survey Basics
1. 
A, C. The purpose of a wireless site survey is to ﬁ nd areas of RF coverage and interfer-
ence and to determine placement of equipment such as access points and bridges. The 
cost of equipment and selection of manufacturer also play a role but are not part of the 
site survey objective.
2. 
A. The number of required access points is a good gauge whether a site survey is 
required. The geographic location of the business, number of wiring closets, and the 
number of servers do not determine if a site survey is required.
3. 
C. Typically the ﬁ rst step of a wireless LAN site survey is to gather the necessary 
business requirements. Interviewing managers and users is the next step, followed 
by determining RF coverage and documenting existing networks. Installing access 
points is one of the ﬁ nal steps.
4. 
A. Enterprise wireless LAN deployments typically use omnidirectional antennas con-
nected directly to an access point. Other antenna types may be used but are not as 
common in this type of deployment.
5. 
D. Manufacturing environments typically use equipment that interferes with devices 
in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Wireless 3G and cellular telephones work in other frequency 
ranges and do not affect wireless LANs. 900 MHz is not used by IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networks. CB radios work at a different frequency range.
6. 
C. Healthcare locations typically have equipment that works in the 2.4 GHz ISM 
band. These devices could potentially cause interference with a wireless network that 
operates in this band. Ofﬁ ce, government, and education installations will not have as 
much ISM equipment.
7. 
C. The type of applications—either hardware or software—that will be used on the 

Chapter 10: Wireless LAN Site Survey Basics 
513
wireless network will have a large impact on the ﬁ nal deployment. This is an 
important question to ask end users. The other questions also need to be answered, but 
they should be asked of managers and IT staff.
8. 
A, C. Physical and data security requirements are part of a wireless LAN site sur-
vey. These requirements may have an impact on the number of access points or other 
devices required for the network. Access point, device, and infrastructure security also 
plays a role but is typically not considered part of an initial site survey.
9. 
C. Of all the devices listed, the voice handset would be the best candidate that 
would use roaming features of a wireless network, mostly because of mobility and fea-
tures. Notebook computers and tablet devices may have roaming capabilities, but these 
devices are not as sensitive to latency. Wireless cameras are usually stationary 
devices.
10. B. The number of devices is an important determining factor in the number of access 
points required for a wireless LAN deployment. The type and manufacturer of devices 
are not concerns. The antenna in a client device will help with providing and maintain-
ing device connectivity.
11. A. Interviewing managers and users will help determine the performance expectations 
of the wireless LAN because they are the ones who will be using it and they have the 
best understanding of the needs of an organization. Locations of RF interference and 
access points are part of the network design stage, which takes place after the gather-
ing of information stage. In most cases, creating ﬂ oor plans is not a primary responsi-
bility of a site survey; however, obtaining ﬂ oor plans is signiﬁ cant.
12. D. Floor plans of facilities can sometimes be imported into site survey software pro-
grams. This helps in determining the RF propagation by placing access points in a 
simulated environment. Access point models as well as cost estimates are required at a 
later time in a site survey.
13. D. Storage of paint and other liquids in large quantities can cause RF to be absorbed.
14. A, F. The business requirements and purpose of the wireless LAN are two areas that 
would be discussed at an initial meeting regarding a site survey. The other topics will 
be discussed at a later time.
15. C. An RF jamming attack would fall under physical security. Access point security, 
infrastructure security, and wiring closet security do not involve RF jamming. Data 
security is a separate issue.
16. B. The aesthetic requirements are usually discussed with hotel management since they 
are the ones responsible for the appearance of the hotel. PoE requirements and RF cov-
erage and interference would be questions for a different group, which in some cases 
may be an outside provider.
17. A. The applications used will determine the number of access points in a wireless LAN 
deployment. Bandwidth-intensive applications may require more access points. Security 
requirements are important but typically do not strongly affect the number of access 

514
Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
points required. Ceiling height is a factor when determining the RF coverage, not nec-
essarily the number of infrastructure devices.
18. B. Access point output power is a determining factor in what type of coverage the 
AP will provide. Wiring closet locations and electrical power requirements are more 
related to wired infrastructure connectivity. Floor plans and blueprints will be used to 
note access point locations.
19. D. The initial gathering of information includes number of users, applications and 
their use, and other wireless networks in the area. The cost of the proposed equipment 
is not usually addressed at this point.
20. C. Ofﬁ ce building deployments commonly use omnidirectional antennas that are 
mounted directly to an access point. Manufacturing, warehousing, and sports arena 
deployments more often use a combination of omnidirectional, semidirectional, and 
sometimes highly directional antennas.
Chapter 11: Performing an RF 
Wireless LAN Site Survey
1. 
A, C. The main objectives of a wireless site survey are to determine areas of RF inter-
ference and RF coverage as well as locations of access points and other infrastructure 
devices. The applications used have more to do with capacity planning. Wiring closet 
locations and security implantations are factors that need to be taken into account but 
are not the main objectives.
2. 
D. Because of RF propagation, site surveys are really three-dimensional. Therefore in 
a three-story building all ﬂ oors need to be taken into consideration. Omnidirectional 
antennas may be polarized either vertically or horizontally. Single-channel architec-
tures use the same channel for multiple ﬂ oors.
3. 
A, B. A spectrum analyzer and a tool that passively scans for wireless networks such 
as NetStumbler can be used for a manual site survey. The other options’ association 
and authentication can be viewed using a protocol analyzer and are not “standalone” 
tools.
4. 
A, C. Manual site surveys can be either passive or active. Scanning is a method of 
locating wireless LANs. A spectrum analyzer will allow you to see the RF. A packet is 
information that carries computer data from one device to another.
5. 
B, D. Non-Wi-Fi interference is interference by anything other than wireless LANs 
that operates in the same frequency range. AM radios and digital TV systems do not 
operate in the license-free bands. 802.11b interference is wireless LAN interference. 
Radar systems operate in the 5 GHz UNII band.

Chapter 11: Performing an RF Wireless LAN Site Survey
515
6. 
C. Recommended received signal strength for voice applications in the 2.4 GHz ISM 
band at a data rate of 54 mbps is about –67 dBm. A recommended signal-to-noise ratio 
is more than 20 to 25 dB. 
7. 
C. A predictive modeling site survey is software-based and takes the attenuation values 
of the building and other materials into consideration. Active and passive are forms of 
manual site surveys and record actual information about the site.
8. 
B. OFDM networks operate in the 5 GHz UNII band and would not affect an 802.11g 
network that operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. FHSS, DSSS, and ERP-OFDM all oper-
ate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and could cause interference with an 802.11g network.
9. 
A, B. The signal strength and SNR are two important values to record during the 
manual site survey process. Signal loss and propagation loss have different effects, and 
packet retries are more of an issue with dynamic rate selection.
10. C. Manual site surveys can be very accurate because actual readings are taken at the 
site using test access points and a wireless client. This can take quite some time to com-
plete depending on the size of the location. Wireless hardware is required to perform 
the site survey, and access to the whole facility is required.
11. A. A spectrum analyzer can be used to view radio frequency. Wireless packets, data 
rates, and association frames can be viewed with a protocol analyzer.
12. B. Since new hardware will be purchased and backward compatibility is not required, 
you could recommend using wireless network hardware that works in the 5 GHz band. 
This will eliminate interference from the other tenants that are using the 2.4 GHz ISM 
band. Automatic channel selection, spectrum analysis, and predictive modeling site 
survey will not help because surrounding access points already use the entire band.
13. B. A predictive modeling site survey will take less time than a passive survey because a 
passive survey requires a manual analysis. On-site protocol analysis or scanning utility 
will determine areas of RF interference from wireless LANs. The predictive modeling 
survey does not help you choose manufacturers’ equipment to be used in a deployment.
14. D. A veriﬁ cation of the predictive survey should be performed to verify that the survey 
meets the customer’s requirements. Although not required, it should be considered.
15. D. Dead spots (areas that lack RF coverage) should be identiﬁ ed on ﬂ oor plans or 
blueprints. This is part of standard documentation practices. Marking them with tape, 
taking a photograph, and showing the site manager in person are not the best ways to 
document dead spots.
16. B. An active site survey requires the survey device to associate to an access point. A 
passive site survey monitors all access points in the area. A predictive modeling site 
survey does not involve associating to an access point. Associating to an access point is 
not a required part of manual testing.
17. D. A semidirectional antenna such as a Yagi is a good choice for an application requir-
ing coverage down a long hallway or corridor. Low- or high-gain omnidirectional 

516
Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
antennas will provide 360-degree horizontal coverage. Parabolic dish antennas are 
typically used for outdoor long-range bridging.
18. D. In this situation, correct antenna selection is important to provide optimal coverage 
as well as proper aesthetics. In this example, a spectrum analysis or protocol analysis 
could be performed but is not required. Environmental conditions are typically not an 
issue in a small ofﬁ ce deployment.
19. A. Co-channel interference is caused by two access points operating on the same radio 
frequency channel. Access points operating on channels 1 and 2 may cause adjacent 
channel interference. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are nonoverlapping channels and will not 
interfere with one another.
20. A, E. A walkthrough of the location and spectrum analysis are both recommended 
guidelines when performing a manual site survey. Equipment purchase and client 
device conﬁ guration are additional factors to consider but are not part of the manual 
site survey. A predictive analysis is a software-based site survey solution that does not 
require manual testing.
Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and 
Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless 
Local Area Networks
1. 
D. Multipath is caused by reﬂ ected signals arriving at the receiver at slightly different 
times (delay spread). Refraction is an RF behavior caused by passing through an object 
of different density, resulting in a change of the signal strength. Absorption is the result 
of a signal not reﬂ ecting or bending or passing around an obstacle.
2. 
B. A wireless client device showing a low received signal strength value could be too 
far away from an access point. Of the answers listed, an additional access point would 
be the best solution. Upgrading the client device or the ﬁ rmware would not help the 
situation. Multipath is caused by reﬂ ections and cannot be eliminated.
3. 
B. A user experiencing a slow connection could be too far away from an access point 
to get a strong enough signal to move data at the highest rate. A 5.8 GHz phone is 
operating at a different frequency and would not cause interference with an 802.11g 
wireless LAN. A MAC ﬁ lter is set on an access point and will either allow or disallow 
a client connection. If a ﬁ rmware upgrade was causing a problem for an access point, it 
would affect all users.
4. 
A. Increasing the output power of the access point will result in a higher received 
signal at the wireless client device. Enabling load balancing will not improve sig-
nal strength but will limit the number of devices that associate with an access point 

Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and Maintaining IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks
517
and may improve throughput. Upgrading the ISP service to faster data rates will not 
improve signal strength for the wireless client. Enabling security such as WPA 2.0 will 
not increase the signal strength seen by the client but is recommended to secure the 
transmission. 
5. 
C. Incorrect security parameters such as a WPA passphrase will prevent a wireless 
client device from completing a Layer 2 connection and obtaining an IP address from 
a DHCP service. If the client device is different technology like 802.11a, the device 
would not have been able to connect. If a static IP address is used, it will not display 
all zeros. Although a computer virus can create problems for the client device, it would 
not prevent the device from obtaining an IP address after connecting to the wireless 
network.
6. 
B. A sudden change in performance might occur if an access point for a new tenant is 
set to the same RF channel as your client’s access point. This could cause interference, 
which would degrade performance. A ﬁ rmware upgrade on the access point usually 
ﬁ xes problems or provides enhancements. Received signal strength is typically an issue 
based on distance from an access point. Diversity antennas would help minimize the 
problems associated with multipath and in most cases would improve performance 
rather than degrade it.
7. 
A. A hidden node problem caused by obstacles or obstructions could be resolved 
by adding another access point so wireless client devices would not be subject to 
clear channel assessment issues. Setting an access point to Mixed Mode will allow 
both 802.11b and 802.11g clients to connect to the network. Increasing the distance 
between the access point and the clients will not improve the situation but will actually 
make it worse. Adjusting the received signal strength on the client would improve per-
formance for that client but would not necessarily solve the hidden node problem.
8. 
B. The wireless LAN client device would be mostly affected by weak signal strength. 
An infrastructure device such as an access point generates the signal received by the cli-
ent. Multipath is a phenomenon that is a result of several wavefronts of the same signal 
reaching a receiver at different times. A transmitter device is responsible for sending an 
RF signal.
9. 
A. A passphrase or preshared key will be validated after an 802.11 authentication and 
association. In order for the client device to get a valid IP address, a successful authen-
tication, association, and passphrase would have to occur. A deauthentication will end 
the authentication state, and a disassociation will no longer allow a device to pass traf-
ﬁ c across the access point.
10. C. Two factors that may have an impact on throughput in a wireless LAN are distance 
from the access point or the output power level of an access point. The IP address and 
MAC address identify the device on the network and would not affect throughput. The 
output power of the client device has more to do with its transmitting capabilities than 
the receiver’s capabilities.
11. A. The device driver is a required component that allows the wireless network adapter 
card to interface with the operating system. A device driver does not provide security 
nor does it identify the network.

Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions
12. A. Hidden node caused by different technology types is the result of the access point 
not being able to differentiate between spread-spectrum technologies. An access point 
set to Mixed Mode will understand both HR/DSSS and ERP-OFDM, which will 
solve the problem. Adding another access point or increasing output power would not 
solve the problem, although that would be a solution for other hidden node scenarios. 
Removing an obstacle is a valid solution for a different hidden node problem.
13. D. A corrupt device driver may cause the network adapter card in a wireless client 
device to operate incorrectly or to malfunction. A terminated Internet connection 
would be a global problem and would affect all users. An upgrade or incorrect ﬁ rm-
ware would not cause the problem only for a single user.
14. A. Layer 1 provides the physical connectivity between devices, which use the air as the 
medium to carry the radio frequency. Layers 3 and 4 are responsible for TCP/IP. Layer 
7 is the interface to the user, also known as the Application layer.
15. C. Windows 98 and later are designed to use the Automatic Private IP Address service. 
This service will provide an IP address to client devices in the range of 169.254.x.x.
This will allow local connectivity for any devices that are connected to a common 
LAN.
16. A. The distance from an access point could affect the received signal strength for a 
wireless client device. The distance from other clients has no impact on devices that are 
connected to an access point. The distance from an Ethernet switch or from the wiring 
closet has no impact on a wireless client.
17. B. The signal-to-noise ratio represents the difference between the received signal 
strength and the level of the noise ﬂ oor. A good signal-to-noise ratio will give a client 
the ability to distinguish between signal and noise and allow it to recover data that was 
transmitted.
18. D. 802.11n takes advantage of multipath, which is typically a problem for other wire-
less LAN technologies. By using multipath, 802.11n devices will have better through-
put than 802.11g devices. Received signal strength means the same thing across 
technologies. DHCP is a service that provides IP addresses automatically. Hidden node 
is a problem that may degrade throughput for connected devices.
19. A. Adding access points can help increase the throughput for a wireless LAN client 
device. This is possible because additional access points would allow for load-
balancing features and therefore provide less contention at that access point. Upgrad-
ing the client software to full-duplex mode is not an option, and if the RF noise was 
increased, throughput would be less. Hiding the SSID has no impact on throughput.
20. C. Increasing the gain of an antenna will provide a larger RF coverage cell, thereby pro-
viding more received signal at the same distance for a wireless client device. Upgrading 
the wireless client will not improve the received signal strength. Load balancing will help 
with throughput, and Microsoft WZC is an example of a built-in client utility.

Troubleshooting
Wiley has attempted to provide programs that work on most computers with the minimum 
system requirements. Alas, your computer may differ, and some programs may not work 
properly for some reason.
The two likeliest problems are that you don’t have enough memory (RAM) for 
the  programs you want to use or you have other programs running that are affecting 
installation or running of a program. If you get an error message such as “Not enough 
memory” or “Setup cannot continue,” try one or more of the following suggestions and 
then try using the software again:
Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation programs 
sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer incorrectly believe that 
it’s being infected by a virus.
Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the less memory is 
available to other programs. Installation programs typically update ﬁ les and programs; 
so if you keep other programs running, installation may not work properly.
Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This is, admittedly, 
a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However, adding more memory can really help 
the speed of your computer and allow more programs to run at the same time.
