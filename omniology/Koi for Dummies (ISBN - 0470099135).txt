About the Authors
R. D. Bartlett began his pet fish-keeping when he netted minnows
out of the brooks near Springfield, Massachusetts. He moved to
Florida and began working as the general manager for Aquarium
Supply, a tropical fish, goldfish, and koi wholesaler, and then
opened his own pet shop.
Patricia Bartlett grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and began
keeping fish at age 10. She has journeyed to Costa Rica and Peru to
net and write about angelfish, discus, and knife fish. She is a recent
convert to the wonderful world of koi.
The Bartletts have co-authored numerous pet care books, mostly
centering on reptiles and amphibians.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
The authors would like to thank the many koi keepers who have
shared their knowledge so freely, especially Butch Kuhl of Pond
Amour and John Hadley of Superior Koi Heaters. We would also 
like to express our appreciation to Grace Freedson.

Introduction
W
elcome to Koi For Dummies, a book designed for two pur-
poses — to tell you about the beautiful fish known as koi
and to make koi-keeping so simple you’ll wonder why you didn’t
pick up this hobby eons ago.
What’s so much fun about koi? They’re gorgeous fish, and they’ve
been selectively bred for more than a hundred years for color, pat-
tern, size, and harder-to-pin-down qualities like grace in swimming
or personality. They’re the fish version of lilies of the field, perfect
on their own merits. For years they’ve been called living jewels,
although we, your authors, find that term a bit on the syrupy side.
Nothing quite compares with koi. Parrots are pretty and can tame
down, but they’re noisy. Orchids are attractive, we’ll grant you
that. But after an orchid’s bloomed, the pretty stuff’s over for a
couple of months. And we haven’t seen an orchid yet that takes
food from our fingers or rolls over to have its belly gently rubbed.
So these are some of the reasons we find koi so much fun. We hope
you will, too.
About This Book
We want you to think of this book as a reference you can turn to 
at any time and find exactly the kind of info you need, so we wrote
it in a modular fashion; each chapter and each section within it 
is self-contained and self-explanatory. You don’t need to wade
through 12 pages of water stratification theory to find out how 
to warm up or cool down your pond, and you don’t need to know
water flow rates to select a filter. Each chapter deals with a differ-
ent aspect of koi-keeping, even starting with the commitment ques-
tion: “Do you, Reader, take this koi . . . ?” No, sorry, we meant, “Do
you, Reader, want to spend 20 minutes twice a day enjoying your
koi and your koi pond?” (Of course you do, and likely you’ll want
to spend more!)
We hope this book clears up any questions that may have been
holding you back, like how to build a pond and how big it should
be, what good water quality means and how to achieve it in a pond
full of fish, and how to get the best koi for your money (which
sometimes doesn’t take much money at all).

Although good science is behind this book, we don’t bombard you
with stuffy abstracts and technical writing that would both panic
and bore you to tears. We want you to have fun and keep turning
these pages because it’s good entertainment and you’re discover-
ing some precious nuggets of information. We want you to have fun
with koi because we have fun with koi, and everyone we know who
keeps koi does so for the fun of it.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate easily through this book, we set up a few 
conventions that we use consistently throughout:
 Anytime we want to highlight new words or terms that we
define in the text, we italicize them.
 Boldfaced text indicates the action part of numbered steps,
the keywords of a bulleted list, or text we suggest you type
into a search engine for more information.
 We use monofont for Web sites and e-mail addresses.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have
needed to break across two lines of text. If you come across these
instances, rest assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters
(such as hyphens) to indicate the break. To use one of these Web
addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, pretend-
ing the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
We tried to keep the technical stuff to a minimum because we don’t
like it either, but sometimes it just snuck in when we weren’t look-
ing and we couldn’t winkle it out. If you see a paragraph flagged 
by a Technical Stuff icon and you go cross-eyed, skip right past it.
Keep in mind, though, that these paragraphs do contain helpful
bits of info for koi-keepers who want to go the extra mile or expand
their arsenal of koi knowledge.
You also don’t have to read sidebar text, which we place in gray
boxes. Sidebars contain helpful and often interesting info, but you
can be sure all the need-to-know stuff is in the regular text.

Foolish Assumptions
We think we know you — a bit. Maybe we’re totally off-kilter, but
here’s what we assumed about you when writing this book:
 You like nature, you like bright colors, and you may have had
an aquarium in your past. Now you’re ready for something a
lot larger, but that something’s got you stymied.
 You know the basics — koi are fish, fish need water, fish need
food. But you’re wondering: How do you ramp up to a 1,600-
gallon pond? How do you move a fish that’s 20 inches long?
Are the $200 koi better than the $20 koi?
 You’d like a fish that’s somewhat more responsive than the
ones you’ve seen swimming about in typical aquariums.

Sit down, you’re in the right spot. We’re here to eliminate the

How This Book Is Organized
This book has four main parts, each dealing with a different aspect
of koi-keeping. Each part is divided into several chapters, all relat-
ing to that part’s topic. We’re all about practicality here — just pick
your topic, find the part, and voila! You have the right chapters.
Here’s what the parts cover.
Part I: Koi Basics
This is the starter stuff — how koi developed, the names of the dif-
ferent color varieties, what it takes (time- and money-wise) to keep
koi, and a bunch of insider info on getting the best koi deals. You
find out how big koi get and get some clues about their growth rates.
Part II: Living with Koi, 
Inside and Out
So it looks like you’ve made the right decision — you want to keep
koi. But now what? This part is oriented toward materials and
pond construction. You find out what supplies you need; how to
plan, build, and landscape a pond; and how to maintain a pond
when it’s up and running. We even have a chapter on setting up a
Introduction

koi pond inside the house. If you like koi, you’ll find this chapter
very useful. An indoor pond is a good way to occupy the empty
bedroom your kids vacated when they went off to college — and 
it prevents them from moving back home when they graduate.
Part III: Caring for Koi and 
Keeping Them Healthy
You are what you eat, and koi are no different. This part tells you
about koi nutrition and the different components in koi diets. You
find out what to feed koi (and even what form to use) at different
times of the year. We provide a recipe so you can make some of your
own koi food, and yes, you can snack on it as you make it. Puree of
collard greens, green peas, and crab meat are quite tasty — before
you add the tubifex worms.
This part also covers the more common koi diseases (though
you’ll never see most of them) as well as the real koi killer — 
stress — and how to diffuse it.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi
Breeding and Showing
Gosh, look at the math: One not-very-fancy koi costs $15; a female
lays 50,000 eggs; raise these babies for six months and you have a
near-instant fortune in that pond. What a great deal!
Okay, there’s a lot more to breeding koi than that, so this part pro-
vides some realism to the picture. We talk about breeding koi, rais-
ing the young, and the continuous culling that’s essential to the
process. We also talk about koi shows — why they’re so much fun
and how you can benefit even if you don’t enter the competitions.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Some people like to see how a book turns out, so they start at the
back. In this book you won’t find out the butler did it, but you will
find more useful stuff condensed down to lists. Have you ever idly
wondered what on earth you’d do if you lost power for a week,
now that your pond’s up and running? Chapter 17 has some ideas
that may save the day for you and your koi. Need to know whether
your koi are getting sick? Run through the list in Chapter 18.

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we use icons in the margins to focus your
attention on certain types of information. Here are the icons you’ll
see and a short description of each.
This is important stuff, stuff you need to keep in mind. None of it is
very difficult.
These are details that a water-soaked koi-keeper thrives on. Skip
them if technical stuff makes you sleepy.
These are points or shortcuts that can make life easier for your koi
or maybe for you.
Think of this as that sideways look you got from your mom one
millisecond before her hand flew out and smacked you on top of
your head when you said something out of line. These warnings
mean the same thing: Stop right there if you know what’s good for
you (and your koi).
Where to Go from Here
Like other books in the For Dummies series, this is a reference
book. Pick a topic and head for the index or table of contents. Both
of them give you the page numbers so you can turn to the info you
need. If you want to know about koi diets, you don’t have to skim a
chapter called Everything about Koi until you find what you need —
instead you just go to the chapter titled Koi Nutrition 101. For info
on those little white spots on your neighbor’s koi, look at Chapter
13 on koi ailments — then take this book to him so he can help his
fish get rid of the little buggers!
The watery world of koi lives in front of you. Jump in! Start with
the cartoons, read a chapter, or check out the index. It’s all here at
your fingertips.

time, money, and space — to set up a koi pond. This part
also gives some insider hints like why you purchase a few
inexpensive canary koi and how to get some very nice koi
for very little money.

etting started with koi may seem to take a lot of effort. So
what’s to love about them — they’re just fish, right? Sure, 
like a diamond’s just a lump of carbon or a Beatles’ song is just a
collection of musical notes. Koi are the ultimate in fish, combining
size, beauty, and grace in one plump package (or rather several
plump packages because koi don’t like to live alone). Because 
their ponds are designed to literally complement the fish, the
ponds add to the aesthetics of koi ownership. When you watch 
koi slowly wheel around in their pond, you’re observing creatures
who occupy another world, one without strife, argument, crowded
roads, or any of the other dubious benefits of civilization.
But you didn’t pick up this book to figure out our philosophy of 
koi-keeping, although you’ll probably find it sprinkled in here and
there. You wanted to know what koi are, what it takes to keep them,
and what makes seemingly normal people get crazy about them.
Your questions have you headed in the right direction and you’re
in the right place. This is the book that tells you how to get started
with koi, how to keep them alive and healthy, what to feed them,
and how to distinguish the different varieties.

Appreciating the Beauty of Koi:
The Underground Fad
Koi can help bring beauty and serenity into your life, and you can
enjoy them for those reasons alone. Watching your koi gracefully
turn in the seemingly bottomless waters before they come to the
surface to nibble food from your fingers can be a calming end to a
hectic day.
But koi have another level of appreciation and it’s based on their
classification. Many koi have been selectively bred to exhibit a par-
ticular color or pattern. Depending on the criteria you select, koi
come in about 13 varieties. Each color or pattern has a Japanese
name, which is where the koi terms you may have heard come into
play. With the help of Chapter 2, you’ll be able to recognize the
basic koi colors.
Koi also have Japanese names for the subcategories of skin type
and markings, but, alas, that discussion’s beyond the scope of this
book. (We wanted you to have something to look forward to on
your first trip to Japan, the koi-keeper’s Mecca!)
Just like purebred dogs, koi have various levels of quality, with
some Kohakus, for example, being better than other Kohakus. You
can always read about a good breed, but going to a koi show to
watch the judges evaluate the fish is a lot more fun. In Chapter 16
we provide some pointers on what you can expect from these koi
shows and reasons why you should go even if you’re not entering
the competition.
Of course, lots of koi don’t fit into specific categories; these mixed
strains, whose parents were of two different color- or scale-types,
are still gorgeous but don’t match the standard classifications.
Although you aren’t able to show these koi in a competition, they
add lots of color and interest to your pond. We include a color-
photo section in this book so you can see the myriad colors of koi
that just may leave you starry-eyed.
The Three Types of Koi-Keepers
Koi-keeping often becomes quite a social pastime, although not
necessarily so. If you do interact with other enthusiasts, it may
help to know what you have to look forward to (and where you
may be heading as well!).
Part I: Koi Basics 
10

The koi market has three levels of koi-keepers:
 The koi kichi (koi crazy) bunch: These folks buy very expen-
sive koi, so it follows that they know a lot about koi and how
to keep them. These individuals feel the best koi are nishikigoi
(koi from Japan) and they’re able to pay the price. Not sur-
prisingly, this is the smallest of the three groups.
 The competitive sort who set koi-keeping boundaries: The
second level of koi fanciers are those who enjoy koi, exhibit
them in competitions, and form the backbone of koi clubs. They
buy good koi no matter where the koi hails from (although all
things being equal, they, too, prefer Japanese koi).
 The casual hobbyists: The third group is by far the largest.
These hobbyists want good-looking fish that get big and do
well in a pond. They want fish with bling (which explains why
metallic koi are so popular in the United States!). Some of
these individuals eventually join the competitive middle
group, and some even move into the upper echelon of the koi
kichi group. But as casual hobbyists, they furnish most of the
money that runs the koi industry, and they’re happy with koi
from Israel, Hawaii, South America — basically anywhere.
Knowing the Essentials 
for Any Koi-Keeper
Before we really get started, we want to point out some essentials
concerning these fascinating fish and what goes into keeping them.
The winner for “Most Obvious”: Koi
Koi do get big (24 inches or more) and they need a good-sized pond,
but you can have just as much fun with a $10 koi as one that costs
$200. (And yes, koi can run $20,000, but we don’t see how anyone
can have fun with a fish that costs that much. As you read on, you
discover just what makes certain koi so much more desirable to 
own and why those koi judges are so taken with them.) Please see
Chapter 16 for more information on the standards for judging koi.
A transitional home for your koi
In addition to a permanent home for your koi, you need a second,
temporary place to quarantine new fish. A quarantine tub allows
you to adjust your koi to its new environment gradually. It also
Chapter 1: Going “Koi Kichi” — Crazy for Koi 11

allows you to observe them for a time so that those with conta-
gious diseases don’t find their way into your main pond and infect
your other fish. A transitional tub can also serve as emergency
quarters if some calamity strikes your pond and as a hospital area
where you can treat sick and injured fish. See Chapter 13 for dis-
cussions on this temp housing.
A permanent home for your koi 
(most likely a pond)
Like making Welch Rarebit (“First start with a rabbit”), if you’re
going to keep koi, first you have to start with a pond. Pond design
and construction have only a few unbreakable rules:
 Keep the design simple: a rectangle, square, or circle. These
shapes are easiest to clean via a filter. If your heart is set on 
a dumbbell-shaped pond, keep goldfish, not koi.
 The pond size may surprise you by being smaller than you
thought. The minimum size is 6 x 9 feet and 4 feet deep, and 
it provides plenty of room for a few koi.
However, little koi grow into big koi (24 inches long or more),
and they need room to swim. We feel honor-bound to warn
you that koi-keepers tend to build bigger and bigger ponds 
to accommodate this growing hobby as time goes on.
If you think that koi just may be the fish for you, we guide you
through the different styles of ponds and their settings in Chapters
6, 7, and 8 so you know which ones take more work and money and
which ones take less.
Pond gadgets: The filter and pump
Status in pond size sets in when the numbers go over five figures,
as in a 15,000-gallon pond. But, before you hyperventilate thinking
about the work to maintain gin-clear (the koi-keepers’ term for
clean) water in a honking-big pond, remember that the pond’s filter
does most of the work. In Chapter 6 we give you the basics on filter
and pump selection. (We group the two together because they go
together. The filter only strains the bad stuff out; you need the
pump to move the water through the filter.)
Koi eat a lot and produce a great deal of waste, so your pond needs
a multifunction filter that can handle mechanical and biological fil-
tration (usually in different parts of the filter), and it needs drains
in the bottom of the pond to feed that filter.
Part I: Koi Basics 
12

Note: Because koi breathe the oxygen dissolved in the water, use a
supplementary air pump to add oxygen to the water. The easiest
design bubbles the air through the top section of the filter drains.
In selecting the right filter and pump, look for a number on the
equipment that indicates the gallons-per-hour it can process. The
filter and pump must be able to turn over (cycle) the water in your
pond every two hours. The larger the pond, the larger the filter
and pump must be. In case you’re wondering about the power con-
sumption, in Chapter 6 we explain how to figure out your per-year
costs to operate any pump. (And no, your utility bill doesn’t have
to be a bad surprise every month.)
The more you hold your utility costs down, the more money you
have to spend on koi. Don’t you just love saving money?
Understanding the Demands 
of a Koi Pond
Although the filtration system performs much of the pond mainte-
nance, you still have to maintain the system and the quality of the
pond water. These tasks consist of the following:
 Backwashing (cleaning the filter): This process has two
steps that take little time and effort:
• Swishing pond water back through the filter to dislodge
all the crud the filter has removed
• Opening a valve so the cruddy water empties out of 
the filter
Some filters have actual filter mats (a bit like those in your
central air conditioner) that you physically remove from the
filter, shake or spray off to dislodge the debris, and then
replace.
 Checking pond chemistry: You can opt for expensive testing
equipment, but a simple $35 kit with test strips is quite ade-
quate. The various colors on the dipped test strips can tell
you a lot about the quality of your pond water and whether
your filter is doing its job. Chapter 9 gives you goals for your
water’s ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH, and we explain what
to do if any values are out of the safe range.
Chapter 1: Going “Koi Kichi” — Crazy for Koi 13

Keeping Koi Healthy: 
A Brief How-To
The easiest way to keep your koi healthy is by keeping the water
clean, but other factors come into play. Chapter 13 tells you what
problems to watch out for and how to handle them if they do show
up. The following list is a glimpse of the most important ways you
can protect your koi:
 Minimize koi stress. One factor in koi illness is stress because
koi just don’t do stress well. Moving a koi into a new pond,
overcrowding koi, or introducing sudden water temperature
changes can all stress koi. Stress drop-kicks the immune
system, and then every opportunistic bacteria or parasite
takes advantage of the situation. Chapter 12 helps you recog-
nize some of the causes of stress and explains how to head off
some of the effects.
 Always quarantine new fish. You may have thought quaran-
tines went the way of the dodo and the bubonic plague, but for
koi, quarantining new fish is the only way to prevent possibly
fatal pondwide problems. Setting up a quarantine pond or tub
is easy (and you can use the same tub for raising koi babies if
you somehow — despite or because of your efforts — end up
with koi eggs). We explain the equipment and the process of
quarantining in Chapter 5.
 Adjust your koi’s environment according to weather.
Wintertime brings prolonged cold temperatures that are hard
on creatures that can’t produce their own heat to stay warm.
When water temps fall, koi literally cannot function; they can’t
digest food (so you don’t feed them for weeks on end), and
they have trouble swimming. Watching koi slowly maneuver in
a 55-degree pond would be almost comical if it weren’t so sad.
In Chapter 9 we offer alternatives to letting your koi overwin-
ter outside. You can avoid some of the cold-water problems
by covering your pond and even more of them by covering
and heating your pond. In this chapter we also offer some
fairly easy pond-covering solutions and talk about heating
choices that fit your pond and your pocketbook.
 Pay attention to your fish. Just like you would for a pet dog
or cat, be sure to inspect your koi if you notice strange behav-
ior. Koi are particularly subject to skin ulcers when the water
temperature is in the mid-60s, which is typical of an early
spring warm-up. In Chapter 13 we show you how to circum-
vent ulcers and capture your koi so you can treat them.
Part I: Koi Basics 
14

Koi are subject to external parasites. Your koi’s skin may sud-
denly be peppered with white dots or dangling, hairlike tendrils.
(Oh, yuck, you say, and we agree.) Maybe their fins develop
little, clear dabs of jelly (except these jelly spots have eyes!).
Parasites are a normal part of life for koi, but they’re not
inevitable. You can get rid of the parasites without having 
to touch a single one. Chapter 13 gives you the lowdown 
on these lowlifes.
Joining a Koi Club: What It Can Do
for You; What You Can Do for It
Misery may love company, but so does a new hobby. Joining a koi
club can help you by giving you immediate access to people who
probably know a lot more about koi-keeping than you do (and
some are even crazier about koi than you are). When something
goes wrong, you have people right there to help you ID the prob-
lem and suggest ways to correct it. If your liner springs a leak or
you have a radical problem with your pond on a Sunday afternoon,
koi club members rally around with their show ponds, extra filters,
and aerators to safely house your pets until you can get your big
pond operational again. That kind of support means a lot.
At the meetings, you gain all sorts of valuable insight. For example:
 You can painlessly get the information you need — or soon
discover you need — in a convivial atmosphere.
 You get insider information such as who’s upgrading their
ponds and selling their old filter systems because they’re too
small for a 20,000-gallon pond. (How big is that? A bit larger
than 25 x 25 feet.) You also get the inside scoop on who’s
ready and willing to make a koi trade.
 You can find out when and where the shows are so you can
see for yourself that those show koi certainly aren’t any 
prettier than yours.
 You get a heads-up on breaking news such as a new disease 
or new legislation, both of which can be destructive.
When the news first came out about koi herpes virus (KHV),
which is both highly communicable and deadly for koi, the
clubs were first to spread the word. They also provided ongo-
ing funding for research and set up more effective quarantine
protocols.
Chapter 1: Going “Koi Kichi” — Crazy for Koi 15

In addition to helping you and your koi, your club participation can
help the hobby as well. Koi clubs are the first line of defense and
information for any rule making that may inadvertently include koi
(like the invasive-species issue).
Magnifying Your Pleasure: The
Many Ways to Enjoy Your Koi
Of course, you can sit beside your pond and enjoy your koi all by
yourself, but you can also increase the fun in so many ways. Check
out the following suggestions:
 Get creative with the landscape. What kind of plantings do
you have around your pond? Are you content with neatly
mowed grass (which you can no longer fertilize due to runoff
affecting your pond)? Does the idea of a Japanese landscape,
where forms and colors are balanced by placement and mass,
intrigue you? Chapter 8 can help you select plantings and
accessories for your pond-surround.
 Let your koi multiply. Do you enjoy your koi so much you’d
like more? Breeding koi isn’t difficult:
• Hatching the eggs just takes a show pond and an aerator.
• Taking care of the young is a cut and dried process as
long as you can handle the every-four-hour feedings and
the culling to reduce the numbers to a manageable level.
Chapters 14 and 15 show you what you need to know from
start to finish.
 Sign up for a koi show. After you have a few good-looking 
koi, you may want to see how they measure up at koi shows.
These shows are held every spring and summer, and they’re 
a great way to meet other koi-keepers, buy supplies, and
maybe, just maybe, purchase another koi or two. Note: You
don’t have to buy koi at a show, but if you start looking at
them, you’re probably sunk. We tried to warn you.

ost people have heard about koi but usually in association
with goldfish. In fact, most people think koi are just big 
goldfish! This chapter gives you plenty of background to under-
stand the start of koi, the different kinds of koi, and their color
combinations and body shapes. We also cover the major koi 
markets, the most popular koi, and how to recognize a winner.
Stick with us to raise your understanding of koi to a whole new
level.
In the Beginning: A Brief 
History of Koi
Koi are descendents of wild (common) carp that have been selec-
tively bred for color, pattern, size, body shape, scales (or lack
thereof), and personality.
Taming of the carp: 
Koi’s grand pappy
The wild carp originated in the freshwaters of the Caspian, Black,
and Aral Sea drainages; they moved eastward with human help to

Siberia and China and westward to Europe and the Danube River.
Some common characteristics include the following:
 It gets big, nearing 50 inches.
 It isn’t a picky eater.
 It’s prolific, even under crowded conditions.
 It tastes good.
 It’s a movable feast.
It was precisely the wild carp’s flavor and its ability to adjust to
captive conditions that led to the development and breeding of 
koi (the Japanese term for domesticated carp). In a country that
had minimal access to large domestic animals such as cattle, carp
also became a valuable source of protein.
The overall hardiness of the koi suited it perfectly for the process 
of domestication. Unlike many fish, carp proved to be quite unde-
manding in terms of water quality, oxygen levels, and diet. As a
result, they were able to adjust to a variety of habitats through-
out Japan and could breed readily in captive or semicaptive 
conditions.
Moving from food to art
As the years went by, the koi-keepers in Japan couldn’t help but
notice any oddball carp. As with any captive breeding program,
spontaneous color and body shape aberrations cropped up from
time to time. For example, the first unusual color was the red in 
a Magoi’s belly scales or at the bases of the fins. Occasionally a
Magoi developed white areas or yellow-brown coloring rather 
than greenish-black. Koi-keepers started putting these brighter 
fish aside and breeding them to each other through several 
generations.
By 1830, the Magoi-keepers were experimenting with the cross 
of a white carp with a red carp, and the Japanese term koi had
expanded to nishikigoi (brocaded or colored carp) to describe the
new domestic version. Note: Today, if you go to Japan or buy fish
imported from Japan, you’re looking at nishikigoi; when you buy
koi raised in other countries, you’re simply buying koi. The differ-
ence is a little like buying chocolates from Switzerland (nishikigoi)
or chocolates from your local grocery store (koi).
Part I: Koi Basics 
18

The Japanese koi breeders soon realized how lucrative breeding
and selling koi destined for the dinner table could be. Some breed-
ers started keeping journals of their nishikigoi, carefully recording
the colors and shapes.
But as koi also became valued for their appearance, the koi with
especially favored traits commanded a higher price than the koi
intended for food. Interest spread among the Japanese people, 
fueling the desire for ever more beautiful and unique strains of koi.
Launching a hobby
The popularity of koi within Japan flourished after an association
of koi breeders held an exhibition of Japanese products in 1914
that included 25 of their prettiest nishikigoi. The concept of a food
source that was easy to raise and pretty to boot was irresistible.
More koi breeders set up mud ponds.
Nishikigoi went international in the 1960s, when the development
of the polyethylene shipping bag for tropical fish meant breeders
could ship live fish by air anywhere in the world. For the first time,
anyone who really wanted a koi (and had the money) could have
one. The poly bag even made it practical for koi fanciers to travel
to Japan to pick out their own koi and then ship the koi directly to
their homes. As a result, this undertaking that was once unique to
Japan has been transformed into a major new hobby with enthusi-
asts throughout the world.
Assessing the Beauty Marks 
of a Koi Today
As with any hobbyist, koi-keepers can approach their favorite 
pastime with varying levels of interest, effort, and expertise. To
refine your skills and better prepare you for navigating the world 
of koi, this section offers you backgrounds on three koi aspects:
size, scale type, and body shape (see the following section “The
Confusing Part (Made Simple): Koi Varieties” for the rest of the
story). With this knowledge under your net, you can easily distin-
guish a highly prized koi from one that’s just so-so.
All terms to describe a koi’s color, pattern, or scale type are in
Japanese. Although these terms may seem confusing at first, take
time to know them so you can hold your own when you talk to
other folks who keep, show, and sell koi.

First things first: Understanding the
difference between goldfish and koi
Before we can delve into the finer points of koi characteristics, 
we need to set the record straight on how they differ from their
distant cousin, the goldfish.
Goldfish and koi are both members of the minnow family, and they
both started out as carp. But they’re about as closely related to
each other as cattle are to oxen. For starters, although they vaguely
resemble goldfish, koi get much larger and have far more demand-
ing housing requirements. Table 2-1 identifies some of their most
striking differences.

Figure 2-1: Physical differences between a goldfish (top) and a koi (bottom).
Chapter 2: Knowing Your Koi 21

However, koi and goldfish also have some similarities such as 
the following:
 A rainbow of colors
 Tail shapes (Note: Diehard koi breeders still sneer at the 
long-finned koi.)
The anatomy of a koi
The koi’s body (see Figure 2-2) isn’t modified for a specific habitat
like many fish are (for example, the flattened, bottom-dwelling
flounder). Rather, its shape is probably what you envision as a 
typical fish shape: tapered and streamlined, but somewhat thick-
set to cut water resistance while swimming. Koi also have several
other distinguishing features:
 Three single fins and two paired fins: The single fins are the
caudal (tail) fin, the anal fin (along the bottom of the body),
and the dorsal fin (along the top). The pectoral fins (at the
sides) and the anal fins (along the rear of the underside) are
the paired fins.
 Vent: Eggs, sperm, and waste products exit the body through
this combined opening.
 Operculum (gill cover): The gill cover is a movable flap on 
each side of the koi’s head. Water taken into the mouth passes
out of the body at this point, after the gills have absorbed its
oxygen.
 Nostrils: Koi use their two nostrils for scenting food and pred-
ators. The nostrils don’t aid in respiration (the gills have that
part covered).
 Barbels: These two pairs of small, whiskerlike projections
near the mouth contain taste buds and help the fish locate
food in the muddy waters they often inhabit.
How big are we talking? 
The size of koi
When it comes to growth, koi harken back to their carp ancestors.
You can buy them as small as 4 inches, but 35 inches is pretty much
the gold standard when you’re talking about big koi. They may need

22

15 to 20 years to max out (most koi reach about 32 inches), but if
you have a big pond — and time — who knows? The only downside
to larger fish is that they’re hard to show because they’re heavier,
lose their scales in regular koi nets, and are less able to deal with
stress (due to their age).
Note: Koi can grow to 6 inches by the end of their second summer,
and that’s the size most wholesalers or retailers want to buy them.
Koi continue to grow for the first five years, generally reaching 15
to 18 inches; after that, growth slows down.
Figure 2-2: The anatomy of a koi.
Recognizing the finer points of koi
A number of characteristics are used to describe koi including
scales, fins, and most importantly, color. But the one unwavering
standard is the body shape. (Don’t worry about remembering all of
this — you can turn back to these pages and polish up your skills
as many times as you want.)
Starting with shape
More than one hundred years of selective breeding have honed the
concept of the perfect koi body (see Figure 2-3 for an eyeful). The
Chapter 2: Knowing Your Koi 23

following categories break down the essentials for when you’re
perusing the ponds for a perfect 10:
 Chub is in. Koi conformation is a bit of a balance between
practicality and aesthetics. The practical matter is that these
fish were once bred and designed as food — the rounder,
fuller, and more fully packed, the better. Because raising
chubby koi required just as much space and food as raising
slender ones, chubby won out every time.
On the other hand, moderation is critical. A fat koi may
appear to lack grace and beauty. As a result, a well-formed 
koi is just like a Barbie doll, neither too fat nor too thin 
(imagine that!).
 Fins and body are proportional. A koi that’s too fat has a
large body but its fins (which don’t change with weight)
appear too small. As a result, the fish takes on a cartoon
appearance.
 The sexiest shape is the upside-down pear. Viewed from
above, the body-perfect widens from the pectoral fins to 
the leading edge of the dorsal fin and then tapers to the 
base of the tail. The nose is gently pointed, not sharply
pointed or foreshortened as if the fish has run into the 
wall a few times.

According to tradition, mature females have a more graceful shape
than the males, which is why most champions are female. Because
champion females are also worth more than champion males (as is
common with any pet), owners may inadvertently select their
females more than their males to display.
Recognizing scale types
At one time, all koi had the same sort of scales, just like other 
fish. But as with any other creature that’s bred for many genera-
tions, oddballs pop up. For koi, there are normal scales and 
variations:
 Doitsu: These are scaleless or partially scaled koi. They can
be any color variety. Doitsu koi are divided by their scales (or
lack thereof):
• Leather-skinned (scaleless)
• Mirror-scaled (rows or groups of distinctly large scales
along each side)
Chapter 2: Knowing Your Koi 25
Where did those long fins come from?
Butterfly koi got their start through Blue Ridge Fish Hatchery in North Carolina. In the
early 90s, the hatchery bought what were called long-finned koi from a fish dealer
in New York City. When the fish arrived, it was obvious they weren’t koi but only a
long-finned carp, and an ugly carp at that.
The long fins were placed in a pond so they could grow up and perhaps get prettier
in the process. Their beauty didn’t increase but their long fins intrigued their owners.
Maybe, they reasoned, those long fins would cross over.
In efforts to breed a long-finned koi, the owners mated the long-finned carp with
metallic koi, producing vigorous young that, sadly enough, looked very much like
the adult long fins. However, the owners held out hope, knowing that many koi don’t
develop their true colors until after at least the first year. So they placed the young
butterfly koi in their own pond until the end of the growing season. At the end of the
season, some of the fish turned out to be quite attractive — Cinderellas in long fins.
Unlike the leather-skinned koi, the arrival of the butterfly koi has been greeted with
caution. No butterfly koi has yet won a Champion. But if you like the graceful look
of the long fins and you appreciate hybrid vigor (the extra vitality that often results
from a cross between two closely related varieties or species), you may want to try
the butterflies in your pond.

You rarely run into Doitsu koi unless you get very serious
about koi.
 KinGinRin: Sometimes normally-scaled koi have KinGinRin
scales, which are highly reflective, normal-sized scales. 
The scales look like tiny spotlights running along the sides 
of the fish and can occur in any color variety. This sparkly
quality is becoming more popular in the United States and 
is now bred into display-quality (inexpensive) koi. The 
placement of the scales determines their shortened 
name:
• The KinGinRin scales atop red coloration are KinRin
(gold).
• The KinGinRin scales atop black or white are GinRin
(silver).
Scales are usually mentioned only when they’re not standard.
Hast thou long finnage?
Butterfly koi are a fairly recent carp development. The term refers
to their long pectoral, anal, and tail fins. If butterfly koi grow 
slowly in a small pond or aquarium, the fins grow very long, 
almost the length of the body. For example, where the usual 
pectoral/body-length ratio for koi is 1:5, butterfly koi are 1:3 
and occasionally close to 1:1.
In addition, their skin has a metallic hue, and they’re very graceful
swimmers. The long fins and metallic hue can be passed on to any
color variety of koi. (Check out the color section of this book to
see the beauty of the butterfly koi.)
The Confusing Part (Made
Simple): Koi Varieties
Koi may seem to be like patchwork quilts, displaying a huge array
of colors and color arrangements, but a clear hierarchy of colors
exists for describing or showing koi.
In addition to size and shape (see the previous sections), koi
judges look at two other characteristics that are a big deal and
deserve their own sections:
Part I: Koi Basics 
26

 Color and color patterns
 Brilliance
The brilliance factor breaks into two simple categories: metallic
and nonmetallic. The metallic and nonmetallic koi are further
divided into varieties, each named according to their color and
color patterns. (Check out more about these two categories at the
end of this section.)
Color me koi: The rainbow 
of many shades
Welcome to the world of naming koi! A white koi with black mark-
ings is different — and thus has a different name — from a black
koi with white markings (although to the uninitiated the difference
can be hard to tell). Along the same vein, a white koi with one
black spot is different from a white koi that’s peppered with black.
(Check out the color section of this book for photos of the various
koi varieties.) To add to the confusion (and in an effort to increase
their market share), koi breeders continually try to develop new
varieties.
Along with head and body shape, the careful placement of color
defines a quality koi. Note: For serious koi owners, if a koi isn’t one
of the major varieties, it’s just another fish.
Four basic rules help you decide a koi’s color:
 Koi are evaluated from the top. Be sure you’re looking down
at it, not from the side.
 Any color can have any skin type. Types include fully scaled,
leather-skinned, and mirror-scaled.
 Colors can change. You can buy a Sanke (a red, black, and
white koi), but sometimes the red disappears as the fish gets
a little older, leaving you with a black and white fish. So, con-
gratulations — now you own a Bekko. Think of it this way:
You’re getting two fish for the price of one.
 Markings can spread. Suppose the blue markings on your 
Ai Goromo are no longer restricted to the red and begin to
spread over the body; your fish is now Goshiki. Again, twice
the adventure!
Chapter 2: Knowing Your Koi 27

At the other end of the spectrum are display or garden koi. These
koi don’t fit any of the named varieties and are far less expensive
as a result. Despite their lack of breeding papers, these koi are
beautiful and just as charming as the more expensive show-
quality koi.
Simply brilliant! The divisions of
metallic and nonmetallic koi
Metallic and nonmetallic are show-quality koi, and the closer 
a particular koi comes to its variety’s standard, the more expen-
sive it is. Note: The nonmetallic designation is accurate, but 
the term isn’t commonly used; the metallic designation is fre-
quently used.
In competition, metallic koi divide into three groups (see the 
subsection “The metallic koi” a little later in this section).
The nonmetallic koi are grouped according to their base color, and
we break down the 13-or-so varieties so you have all the info you
need before heading for the fish farm.
In all honesty, the classification system is a bit wacko — some koi
enthusiasts include KinGinRin (see the previous section) as a vari-
ety, so theoretically any shapeless koi of any color with KinGinRin
scales can compete against any other KinGinRin. The classification
is more of a guideline than a concrete system.
The nonmetallic koi
The standard nonmetallic koi types have no special glow to their
scales, just a sheen or luster that doesn’t distract from the color 
or pattern. The fish in this group tend to be reds and blacks
because these colors show up better without metallic scales.
Check out Table 2-2 for a brief rundown of the nonmetallic koi 
varieties.

The metallic koi
These koi are characterized by a reflective layer in the scales that
makes the fish seem to glow in bright lighting. They’re spectacular
in a pond with black or dark green walls. Although metallic koi
boast fewer varieties than the nonmetallic, these are popular fish
nonetheless.
Because the reflective quality of metallic scales reduces the reds
and blacks that are so admired in the nonmetallic koi, a whole 
different set of colors are prized in the metallic category (see 
the previous section for the best nonmetallic colors).
Metallic koi, also called Hikari koi, are separated into three groups
as follows:
 Hikarimuji (or Hikari Muji): Koi with one metallic color
(Because nothing is ever simple in koi-keeping, this group 
also includes Matsuba koi, which are patterned).
• Matsuba: Metallic one-color koi that have a black 
marking in the center of each scale which gives them 
a pine-cone-like pattern. They may be gold, gray, silver,
or orange.
• Ogon: Single-colored koi that may be gold, silver (or
platinum), orange, or red and white. This last color mix
is basically a metallic Kohaku. A highly reflective head is
a desirable quality in the Ogons.
 Hikariutsuri (or Hikari Utsuri): These are Utsuri or Showa
that have gone metallic; in other words, they’re metallic red,
black, and white koi.
Because the metallic quality of the scales tends to overwhelm
the red and black, outstanding examples are hard to find. Put
them in a blue show bowl and they look really ugly; put them
back in a black pond and they look pretty good. Showing
these fish is a study in frustration.
 Hikarimoyo (or Hikari Moyo): These are multicolored metal-
lic koi, with platinum and red or platinum and yellow.
The Popularity Contest: Which
Varieties Take the Trophy?
Some koi varieties are more popular than others. And surprisingly,
the most popular koi are quite ordinary, decorative-type koi with
no special markings or distinguishing characteristics. This seeming
Chapter 2: Knowing Your Koi 31

contradiction is good news for people who think that serious koi-
keeping requires very expensive koi.
To illustrate this contradiction, consider the following facts:
 The red and white Koromo is a more popular variety than the
Showa (a red, white, and black koi).
 If your Utsuri Mono is competing against a Koromo, don’t be
surprised when the judges select the more popular — but
obviously plainer — Koromo.
 The Tancho (an all-white koi with a red rosette on the top of
the head) is possibly the most popular koi of all despite its
rather plain color scheme.
Different koi are popular in different countries. For example,
Japanese koi-keepers favor the traditional, normal-scaled koi 
in some combination of white, red, and black colors. But in the
United States, the brightly reflective KinGinRin koi are popular.
Japanese breeders may also prefer the older koi varieties with
normal scales, but breeders in other countries enjoy the leather-
skinned, mirror-scaled GinRins and long-finned varieties more.
Long fins haven’t gained the acceptance level of other koi 
characteristics in competition, so they’re usually in a separate
class. Nonetheless, the long-finned morphs are very popular with
hobbyists and with companies who supply display-quality koi for
public ponds.
The Karate Kids of Koi: Tategoi
and Their Potential
Tategoi means keepkoi, a koi that is worthy of keeping. These are
koi with potential, koi that by dint of breeding or appearance have
the potential to get better, become prize winners. Tategoi are usu-
ally young fish, but they can also be mature fish whose potential is
just being realized.
The term is also widely misused for marketing, much like the 
term investment dressing, where a $2,500 dress suit is supposed to
make the wearer look great and stay stylish for years. A crafty koi
breeder can label any koi Tategoi— and how is a newbie going to
know any better?
Part I: Koi Basics 
32

The hallmark of a real Tategoi is its skin — not the color or texture,
but the quality. The markings are intense and well placed. In addi-
tion, the head is unblemished, the body is solid but not fat, and the
fins are in proportion to the body.
Who decides whether a koi is Tategoi? Ay, there’s the rub. Anyone
can decide that his fish, one or all, have the potential to be champi-
ons. But it makes a lot more sense to depend on the breeder’s rep-
utation, how long the firm’s been in business, and your
relationship with that breeder.
Points to keep in mind when looking for a Tategoi:
 Ask a fish dealer that you respect to serve as your agent. 
Tell her
• How much you want to spend
• What kind of koi you want
• What size fish you want
Be specific. If you’re going to spend the money to buy a Tategoi,
buy one you’re going to enjoy. The fish dealer makes the trip to
Japan, but she’s shopping for you and your needs, not just for a
Tategoi. Consider these other purchasing options:
 Some koi dealers bring in a group of high-quality, young koi 
as a weekend special event. You look over the fish and buy the
one you like best. Maybe it’s a Tategoi, but maybe it’s a pretty
koi that simply delights you every time you feed it.
 When your local pond store gets a new shipment of koi from
Japan, be among the first to check it out.

F
or most people (probably you, too), the idea of koi-keeping 
is one that evolves from a couple of inexpensive goldfish in a
small backyard pond with a filtering system and a bunch of plastic
cattails. At some point, as you sit on a lawn chair at the edge of the
pond, watching your goldfish, you may wonder, “Could there be
more to pond keeping than this?” And the quest begins: You surf
the Web under koi, borrow koi books from the public library, and
check with a local pet store to find a local goldfish and koi club.
You go to a meeting, go on a pond tour, and go to a koi show, 
where members talk about ponds of 6,000 gallons and filtering 
systems that seem large enough to clean up Lake Erie.
Suddenly your goldfish just don’t have what it takes. You want 
serious fish, fish that swim into your palm to eat, gorgeous fish
that are bigger and bolder. . . .
What you want are koi.
But are koi for you? That’s the question. And the answer is in this
chapter, which tells you how much you have to commit (space-,
time-, and money-wise) if you want a koi pond. This chapter isn’t
designed to discourage but to enable you to plan more effectively
and sensibly if you choose to purchase koi.

Do You Have the Space It Takes?
You have two basic considerations to bear in mind when deciding
how much space you’ll allot to your koi. The first and most obvi-
ous point is the actual size of the fish and the swimming room that
they need. The second point is less apparent but just as important.
Koi have hearty appetites and produce huge amounts of nitroge-
nous wastes. An appropriately large volume of water dilutes ammo-
nia and other toxic substances so they’re less harmful to the fish
and less burdensome on your filtration system.
Calculating a koi’s fin-flippin’ space
Several long-tested formulas can help you figure out how many koi
fit in your pond or aquarium, and they all work off the simple con-
cept that bigger fish need more space than smaller fish. The formu-
las give different answers, so for the sake of not driving you crazy,
take the middle road. As if you haven’t noticed, koi-keeping isn’t an
exact science; it’s science mixed with art.
Crowded koi have less margin of safety than uncrowded koi. Figure
1 1⁄2 inches of fish per square foot of surface area. To avoid crowd-
ing your fish and allow for growth, stock your pond well below the
upper limits of the formula. For example, in a 6-x-9-foot pond, the
formula allows 81 inches of koi or ten 8-inch koi. See Table 3-1 for
calculations of koi that fit in the most common pond sizes.

Plan ahead for the possibility that your fish will outgrow their
accommodations. In some cases, a stronger filter may increase
your pond’s capacity a bit, but eventually you may need to install 
a larger pond or find a new home for some of your fish. Although
parting with a favorite pet may be difficult, remember that over-
crowding (either by size or number of fish) sooner or later causes
the death of all of them.
Part I: Koi Basics 
36

Estimating the space your 
koi’s habitat requires
Keeping koi can take up your entire yard, part of your yard, or just
a corner of your living room — depending on your time, interest,
and finances. Keeping only a few small fish that you’ll give away 
as they outgrow their accommodations is obviously a different
prospect than maintaining a dozen adult koi in a large garden
pond.
The space for your koi pond is more than just the hole that con-
tains the water. In this section, you discover some less obvious 
factors to consider. But deciding on the pond’s size is perhaps the
most important decision that faces the new koi owner, so please
think carefully about your choice.
How much outdoor space do you need for a pond?
When figuring the space that your pond and surrounding areas will
need, consider two components:
 Size of the pond
 Access area to the pond, including space for the filter
The smallest pond you can build for koi is 6 x 9 feet across and 4 feet
deep, or just over 1,500 gallons. This is way big enough to afford
swimming space (and years of growing space) for ten 8-inch koi 
or six to seven 12-inch koi, or roughly 81 inches of koi (if physicists 
can have light-years, we can have koi-inches, right?). A pond must
be deep enough and large enough to allow the fish to move verti-
cally and horizontally without feeling cramped. The depth of a pond
(4 to 8 feet) also gives the koi a chance to swim down and out of a
predator’s reach (such as herons and raccoons and, in one case, the
family cocker spaniel, who nabbed his fish directly from poolside).
Here are the other size considerations you need to keep in mind:
 A pond of any size needs an access area of at least 5 feet
along one long side and space for your filter along a short
side. The access area allows you to feed and closely observe
your fish and is the main place from which you manage rou-
tine chores, such as removing leaves and netting sick fish.
 You need a clear area of 2 to 3 feet around the filter. This
space allows you to perform such tasks as backwashing, win-
terizing, and replacing the hose. You may as well provide this
space along the entire side that your filter’s on so you can get
to it easily.
Chapter 3: Making Sure Koi Are Right for You 37

 You need some access around the rest of your pond. Pond
leaks, for example, can crop up anywhere, and you’ve got to
get near the leak in order to fix it.
Adding in the access strip and the filter strip along two sides of a 
6-x-9-foot pond gives you a pond footprint of 9 x 14 feet. Use a
garden hose to loop out a rectangle of that size in your yard. So
you don’t have to measure each area, place a strip of masking 
tape on the hose at 46 feet — 9 + 9 + 14 + 14 — from the end.
Of course, you can go larger if you have the space, but the absolute
maximum you want for a koi pond is 9 x 14 x 4 feet deep. The rea-
sons for this limitation are pretty simple:
 When you need to medicate the entire pond (as you occasion-
ally must), the bigger the pond, the higher your med costs.
 If you need to catch a particular fish, the bigger your pond,
the harder it is to net the fish (and the more stressed your fish
can get from being chased).
Can they stay inside? Indoor space requirements
You can keep koi inside your home in a large aquarium; you just
can’t keep them very long. Well-fed koi grow quickly, and they’ll
soon be too big for all but the very largest aquariums.
Aquarium housing for koi only works if the koi are 6 inches max.
When fish are longer than that, they’re too big for an aquarium
indoors and need a larger pond to flip around in, which typically fit
only outside (unless you have an enormous house, that is). Newly
hatched koi generally reach a length of 6 inches by age 2, so even if
you start with small fish, you need to have an outside pond or a
foster home rather quickly.
Is Time on Your Side?
Keeping koi should be a thoroughly enjoyable prospect. However,
along with the pleasure comes the responsibility of providing your
new pets with proper care. By having some idea of the time you’ll
need to invest, you can more easily understand how koi ownership
will affect the rest of your schedule.
Keeping up a koi pond
The time involved in the care of koi and upkeep of their pond
varies with the season and, in some cases, with the geographic
Part I: Koi Basics 
38

location of the pond. You’ll face busy times and quiet times, each
with their own necessary tasks and unique rewards. In this section,
we examine how seasonal changes affect both your fish’s behavior
and the degree of care that you need to provide.
 Summer: During the summer, you need an hour each week to
clean the filter, do a partial water change, and check water
quality. Your koi need feeding once or twice a day (maybe 5
minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the evening — long
enough to sit and enjoy your fish). Total time each week:
about 2 3⁄4 hours.
 Winter: Wintertime routines for ponds in northern climes are
much more relaxed. You need to cover your pond to keep the
water temperatures at least 52 degrees F, and you may need to
heat your pond as well. A variety of commercial pool covers
(see Chapter 9) and submersible heaters are commercially
available. Check the water temperature daily and the water
chemistry every two weeks. Time needed? Less than half an
hour a week.
For ponds in the southern Sunbelt, where nighttime air tem-
peratures rarely dip below 60 degrees, continue feeding your
fish daily, checking your water chemistry weekly, and cleaning
your filter every other week. The time to complete this work
alternates between 45 minutes one week and 90 minutes the
next week.
 Spring: When spring approaches, you have some basic pond-
housekeeping chores. Begin with vacuuming out any sludge
and making a partial water change; then clean and restart the
filter. These steps take about 90 minutes, counting the water
change time. In a few days, the beneficial bacteria become re-
established in the filter.
Being prepared for a 
lifelong commitment
Koi are hardy little suckers. With good care and attention to the
water quality, your koi may outlive you! In Japan, a koi of 100 years
isn’t unusual.
Although some pond keepers trade up or trade down (depending
on the size of their koi, the size of their pond, and their own desire
for change), other fin-fans prefer to keep their koi, watching them
mature and enjoying them as family pets. For the pond keeper with
bad luck or sloppy pond-keeping skills, the average life span of a
koi is less than a month.
Chapter 3: Making Sure Koi Are Right for You 39

With luck, you figure out the problem (maybe early enough to save
the koi) so you can take steps to change course for this or future
attempts. But, if you have bad luck in the beginning, do a reality
check before you invest any more time, money, and effort. Ask your-
self, “What should I do differently next time?” Of course, when deal-
ing with live animals, you must face the prospect of loss and accept
that forces beyond your control may intervene. But a koi owner can
take comfort in the fact that the basics are straight forward.
Following a loss, the best course of action is to research the prob-
lem thoroughly by reading about koi in general and your own situa-
tion in particular. Reread this book, paying particular attention to
those areas you may have skimmed over in your excitement to
begin. Speak with other hobbyists, koi suppliers, and, if possible,
professionals at your local public aquarium (many such institu-
tions have staff or volunteers who are happy to address questions
from serious hobbyists). Armed with your new knowledge and
resources, start over slowly and carefully. As you gain experience
and wisdom, your successes will increase.
Do You Have the Bread to Buy,
House, and Care for Koi?
In the excitement of starting a new hobby, it’s very easy to under-
estimate the expenses involved. Some, such as the price of the
fish, may be obvious, but less evident costs abound as well. This
section alerts you to all the monetary considerations in the keep-
ing of koi. After reading it, you’ll be able to make an informed 
decision as to how much your interests will cost to pursue. By
starting on a scale that’s appropriate for your budget, you avoid
future disappointments.
The cost of the fish alone
The cost of koi has a vast range: They start at about $10 for koi 
3 1⁄2 to 4 inches long and go to $20,000 or higher for just one adult!
The younger koi usually sell in groups of six or more. However, in
larger cities with many retail outlets, you can purchase young koi
individually.
The smallest and least expensive koi are sold in bulk from breeders
at the end of a summer, when the fish that hatched that spring are
about 4 inches long. Usually these koi go to other breeders or to
wholesalers. These people may resell the 4-inchers directly, or
they may size up the fish over the winter.

If you plan on keeping koi indoors, your expenses will be consider-
ably less, as you won’t need a heater or UV sterilizer. The least
expensive option is a traditional aquarium of 55 to 100 gallons (of
course, in this case, you’re limited to keeping koi of approximately
6 inches or less in size). Indoor pools and quarantine tubs vary
enormously in cost because of the wide variety of sizes and materi-
als. In general, the prices for the enclosures and the life support
equipment are a good deal higher than for traditional aquariums
but less than for outdoor ponds.
See Table 3-3 for a general rundown of the equipment expenses for
keeping koi inside in an aquarium.

The necessary funds 
for koi maintenance
Although your main cash outlay will be in the startup phase of
your hobby, be aware that koi cost money to maintain. Certain
expenses, like food, arise on a regular and predictable basis.
Others, like medications, are less easy to foresee. Your most
common ongoing expenses are shown in Table 3-4.

*Note: Natural gas heating may be less expensive, but even it isn’t cheap.
Life-support system parts need replacement eventually, as pumps
burn out, hoses leak, and filter parts break down. Stock all the
basic medications when you first purchase your fish, but be aware
that you may need to purchase additional drugs as unforeseen
medical problems arise.
Other unpredictable expenses include emergency situations — a
power outage or disease outbreak that causes the loss of many
fish, for example. Or, perhaps a predator such as a raccoon takes
up residence nearby and you need to hire a trapper to remove the
animal. Situations like these are impossible to predict, but you
need to budget for general emergencies when figuring out your
future expenses.

Building a Pond? Construction
Costs to Consider
Ponds are holes in your garden that you line with one of the 
following items:
 A rigid, preformed plastic shape
 A pond liner (a thick but pliable plastic sheet)
 Cement (in effect, a swimming pool for fish)
Each type of pond construction has its advantages and constraints,
but two elements are consistent regardless of the construction
type: permits and the inevitable hole in the ground. In this section
we cover those factors first and then go into each type of construc-
tion and its estimated costs.
Securing the necessary permits
Pond construction also has permit issues, so don’t be surprised 
if you need one permit to dig a pond and more permits for the
plumbing and electrical work. Keep in mind that many municipali-
ties require ponds to be fenced to ensure the safety of other people;
the construction of this fence is subject to strict guidelines and may
require a permit as well.
It’s impossible to estimate permit costs because they vary greatly
and are often tied to the size of a project and to local property
values. Consider this matter carefully, however, because the 
cost of permits and legal advice, if necessary, can be quite high.
Property owners who fail to proceed legally can be subjected to
heavy fines and significant construction delays. Of course, the
tragedy that can result from an improperly fenced pool in an area
with small children speaks for itself.
Digging the hole
The first part of actual pond construction is digging the hole. You can
 Hire this labor out to an operator who has a backhoe. In our
area, it’s $80 per hour. (If you get it this cheap, add a tip, okay?)
 Rent a backhoe and perform the labor yourself if you’re expe-
rienced or you think it sounds like fun. Renting a backhoe is
by the day or half-day, at $150 per half-day or $275 per day.
Chapter 3: Making Sure Koi Are Right for You 43

 Hire laborers to dig the hole. Laborers and cement finishers
are $15 per hour in our area.
 Dig it yourself with the help of some willing friends (and a
whole lot of refreshment incentives).
Obviously, backhoe rental, cement, and labor expenses vary by
location and the size of the job. Backhoes with operators rent by
the half-day, and, because the rental fee includes travel time, plan
to budget at least a half-day.
You may think scooping out a hole in the ground is a fairly simple
operation. Two words of advice: Never assume! And never underes-
timate the number of shovels of dirt a 9-x-6-x-4 hole can hold.
(Okay, that was more than two words.)
Buying a preformed pond
The average preformed plastic pond is too shallow and too small
to house koi. However, outlets dealing specifically in outdoor
ponds and fish are well worth searching for. They stock a variety of
preformed ponds in many sizes, some of which are quite large and
have shelved areas along the edges, where you can place aquatic
plants. You can buy a preformed fiberglass swimming pool that a
truck delivers to your site and lowers by crane, but these pools
often have a pale turquoise color, not the dark coloring that a koi
pond needs to be. (See Chapter 6 for more of these pond specifica-
tions and explanations.)
Installing a pond liner
Pond liners are simple to use and not expensive. They’re not a for-
ever-type pond (like cement), but their do-it-yourself qualities and
low replacement cost make these the pond of choice for most hob-
byists. Plan to install plumbing for the filter and pond skimmer
before you place the liner. Then, after you’ve laid down the liner,
you can cut through it to fit the filter and skimmer bulkheads (the
fittings around pipes that penetrate the liner and make the opening
watertight). The 45-mil. (thousandths-of-an-inch) liner comes by the
square foot, which makes it easy for you to determine basic costs.
To determine the size of liner, use the following formulas:
Length: Length + 4 feet + (2 x depth)
Width: Width + 4 feet + (2 x depth)
Part I: Koi Basics 
44

For a 6-x-9-x-4-foot pond, you calculate as follows:
Length: 9 + 4 + (2×4) = 21 feet
Width: 6 + 4 + (2×4) = 18 feet
So, you need a liner that is 21 feet x 18 feet. For pricing purposes,
that’s 378 square feet.
Buy a patch kit that’s marketed for the liner size that you’ve
chosen because sooner or later all pool liners leak. (Check out
Chapter 9 for more about upkeep.)
Pouring a cement pond
Cement ponds are every koi owner’s dream. They’re permanent,
leak-proof, essentially maintenance-free, and elegant. But they’re
also expensive — and, again, size and shape do matter. The cost
from start to finish for a basic 9-x-6-x-4-foot pond with all the essen-
tial elements (permits, filter, drains, lights, and so on) in Florida is
approximately $5,500.
Don’t attempt to construct your own cement pond unless it’s your
profession. (Note: Being handy doesn’t in any way qualify you to
install a cement pond!) A very specific set of skills, along with
experience, is necessary if the pool is to look good and function
properly. Contrary to popular opinion, cement work like pond con-
struction requires far more than a strong back. And working with a
professional in planning your pond is a very rewarding experience.
Cement ponds have one very appealing feature: After you agree on
a design with a pond construction company, your work is done
(except for handing over the payment, of course). However, work-
ing with a construction company has a few caveats. Make certain
your contract spells out details like
 The slope of the bottom of the pond (it should center around
the bottom drains).
 The number of underwater lights, their size, and placement.
 The number and placement of drains and outlets for filters
and pond skimmers (see Chapter 7 for more information on
building a pond).
Chapter 3: Making Sure Koi Are Right for You 45

Accounting for Your Climate
Geographical locations — and their climatic pluses and minuses —
greatly affect the pond and koi in your yard.
 In the South: Koi-keepers in the South probably never need 
to heat their koi ponds; ponds stay warm enough in colder
weather with a simple cover. However, during the summer,
these same koi-keepers may need to add a waterfall or foun-
tain feature to cool the pond water.
 In the desert: Koi-keepers in arid areas like southern Arizona
need to top off their ponds with fresh water to replace water
lost through evaporation. They also need a protein skimmer
to filter off that scummy layer of pollen that settles after the
summer monsoons.
 In the North: Koi-keepers in the North bear the brunt of
expenses (like heating costs during the winter). Most koi-
keepers elect to cover their pond when water temperatures
dip below 52 degrees F, the point at which koi become rela-
tively inactive (see Chapter 9 for the specifics on these
covers). The cover can be Pliofilm stapled to a 2-x-4-foot
frame just a few feet above the water. Note: When covering
places and plants to avoid frost damage, the covering must be
in contact with the earth or the pond’s cement apron all the
way around the pond in order to hold in the latent warmth of
the earth.
For northern Koi-keepers, the big difference in cost is electricity
and natural gas costs during the winter. One koi-keeper we know
spent $600 a month to warm his pond, but he had a big pond, not
the modest postage-stamp-sized pond we propose here.
Heating a pond in the north is not a DIY project because too much
is at stake. Talk to other koi owners about how they handle heating
their ponds, call a couple of commercial koi heating-system con-
tractors, and check with your local utility to see whether their
engineers/conservation staff suggest using propane over electric-
ity. You may even consider building a structure over the pond (like
a greenhouse or conservatory) that’s attached to the house so you
can enjoy your heated pond in midwinter. Even if it costs you the
proverbial arm and a leg, at least you’ll be able to see and interact
with your koi while the weather outside isn’t fit for man or beast.

A
t last. Finally you can drag out all those colorful koi books
you’ve been stocking up on, unearth the price lists, sit back
in the deck glider, survey your koi domain, and get ready to make
some choices. The task now is to truly define your wants, success-
fully acquire the fish of your dreams, and safely establish them in
your pond. In this chapter, we help you determine the best places
to look for those dream koi and make sure you’re getting affordable,
healthy koi.
The good part of this decision making is that your initial choices
need not be your final choices. You can start out on the inexpen-
sive side of cost and upgrade when you truly feel the need. The fun
part of koi-keeping, though, is that many people stay with their
original koi — they find the fish so much fun to keep and so per-
sonable that they don’t want to part from them.
Oh Where, Oh Where 
to Buy My Koi?
Unless you make the trek to Niigata, Japan, the only way you can
actually see the fish you’re buying is generally through a local pur-
chase. If you’re willing to take a leap of faith — until you see how
well the system works — you can try the Internet and the classi-
fied ads in koi magazines. This section introduces you to the three
major markets in koi breeding and then offers more specific advice
about koi shopping in the United States.

Part I: Koi Basics 
48
Recognizing the major markets:
Japan, Israel, and the United States
Where you buy your koi, it turns out, is not nearly as important as
what you buy. Ultimately, you want koi that match your personal
taste, whether that means they’re inexpensive, expensive, or some-
where in between.
A hop, skip, and a jump overseas: Japan
Japanese koi are the ultimate koi — koi-keepers want them, dream
about them, and want to travel to Japan to buy them. These koi are
the result of over 100 years of captive breeding and very careful
culling (selecting); they’re raised by individuals who may be third-
generation koi breeders.
In Japan, the cool, mountainous, prefecture of Niigata is the locus
for prize-winning koi. This is where the colors and patterns that
koi-keepers covet were developed, described, and perpetuated.
Enthusiasts wishing to see the Holy Grail of koidom travel halfway
around the world (at considerable expense) to see the koi facilities
and buy koi, and they’re never disappointed. Even if you’re not
planning to show your koi in competition, your Japanese koi are of
better quality than most keepers see in 30 years of koi-keeping.
The trip itself is a great adventure and a delightful opportunity to
experience the Japanese culture. Purchasing koi in Japan is some-
thing of a courtly ritual that involves polite interactions between
yourself, the other buyers, and the seller; it will, no doubt, be the
highlight of your journey.
A quick jaunt over the Pacific: Israel
The koi market is so robust that other countries are following Japan’s
lead. Kibbutzim (collective farms) in Israel that have raised food
fish for years now have koi-breeding operations.
At first the members of the kibbutzim raised koi for the middle
market, the many pond owners who discovered they enjoyed the
hobby. Through careful cultivation techniques, the members
became extremely successful in raising quantities of koi. But, as
their market expanded to new countries, the kibbutzim farmers
realized there was a market for higher-quality koi. The quality of
the Israeli koi began to edge up.
Today, Israeli production is very high (breeding a lot more and
culling a lot less than the breeders in Japan). Nevertheless, Israeli

Chapter 4: A Koi Buyer’s Guide 49
koi maintain a reputation for being great substitutes for Japanese
koi, especially for people who can’t afford to buy from Japan.
Most of the Israeli production goes to England because air travel
distances are shorter than the Israeli–U.S. connection or even the
Japan–England connection. Koi from Israel generally aren’t avail-
able in the U.S.
Koi on American soil (in waters, rather)
American koi range in quality from just-imported nishikigoi (the pre-
ferred Japanese term for koi) at please inquire prices to domestic,
decorative koi in unclassified colors and patterns. Most American
breeders are in the northeastern states or California, but an increas-
ing number are springing up in the southern tier of states, where
land costs are lower and the number of pond heating days is lower.
American breeders work on three levels, supplying very high 
quality koi to the upper range of the market, very good koi to the
middle market, and handsome but undistinguishable mutts to the
pond-keepers market. Today the demand for koi, pond construc-
tion, and other pond services is so large that many breeders do
well without participating in the upper end of the market.
Comparing the three great koi locales
The competing koi-breeding operations in Israel and the United
States have a few points going for them:
 Their locations provide a longer growing season than Niigata,
Japan, where growth is limited to approximately five months
each year. In Israel and parts of California and the southern
United States, the mild climate allows the koi to grow through-
out the year, or nearly so. The season is shorter in the 
northeastern United States but still approaches six months
in length.
 Due to the warmer weather, they’re able to stagger their
breeding dates to provide varied sizes of fish.
 They’re closer to major markets, such as England (and the
United States, of course), than Japan is.
 They produce more fish. Israeli breeders focus more on pro-
duction than on superb conformation to take advantage of
the perception that Japanese koi are expensive. For example,
27 percent of Israeli hatched fry are raised to 5-inch lengths.
Japanese koi breeders, on the other hand, routinely dispose
of more than 99 percent of a hatch before the young are 
11⁄2 inches long.

Does this mean every koi from Japan is better than an Israeli koi?
Not at all. A good koi is only as good as its genes. You can get
excellent koi from Israel, and you can get not-so-good koi in Japan.
However, Japan does have a much longer koi-breeding history, and
its multigenerational breeders have genetically true lines — they
produce young that look very much like the parents.
So, although Japan is hands down the best place to buy the world’s
sexiest koi, it comes down to you. If you’re not absolutely mad
about koi, you can find beautiful ones to fill your pond from
American or Israeli farms.
Until recently, Israel had one problem that Japan did not — koi
herpes virus (KHV). Israel’s first outbreak was confirmed in 1999,
but then Japan also had an outbreak in 2006. According to the
press, the KHV was confined to one breeder and traced to
imported stock. After several months of concerted effort by the
Japanese breeders and absolute quarantines and extirpations,
Japan’s outbreak was considered eradicated by the end of summer
2006. Now Israeli fish breeders grow Koi in entirely isolated and
enclosed environments and also vaccinate to immunize fish, con-
trolling the spread of KHV.
Visiting your local garden store 
(or pet store or aquarium shop)
Finding the perfect koi (or at least the near-perfect koi) may 
be as easy as visiting the pond section of your local garden store,
pet store, or aquarium shop between April and September. This is
possible in many areas of the United States as well as in other
parts of the world where the hobby is enjoyed (if you live in Japan,
you’re about as lucky as you can get when it comes to obtaining
terrific koi). In addition to the basic, generic koi that local empori-
ums stock, store owners are usually very nice about ordering up
for a customer who’s interested in a bit-out-of-the-ordinary koi.
Most often these fish are ordered from local breeders, but stores
that specialize in koi may be able to obtain them from abroad
as well.
Shops usually group koi by size and price, and 6-inch koi run
about $18 each. The larger the koi, the higher the price. Keep in
mind, though, that garden shops and pond stores may not be your
best place to shop for championship or championship-potential
koi. For that specialty, plan to make friends with a koi dealer or
breeder.

Heading straight for the source:
Local breeders
Purchasing locally is the easiest and least complicated way of
acquiring your koi for two reasons:
 It allows you to choose the patterns and colors that you like
the best from a multitude of koi.
 It precludes the necessity of shipping the fish and the stress
they undergo as a result.
With any luck, you have three options for buying your koi locally:
 From a fellow koi-keeper: Most koi-keepers try to breed fish
at some point, or they find that the fish have taken matters
into their own fins, as it were — and baby koi have invaded
the koi pond. Whether by luck or by artifice, the young koi
survive and, like all other koi, they grow. As a result, local
keepers often have small koi for sale at a very good price.
 From a local breeder: Pull out your local phone book and
check the yellow pages under ponds. A few phone calls can
help you discover whether koi are available locally in a
number of varieties.
 From a local commercial breeder: Although a local vendor
may say his firm is wholesale only, you may be able to order
from him if you meet the quantities requirements. Note:
Wholesalers often contribute koi to local koi auctions, another
way for you to get a really good koi or two for not much money.
As you select your favorite koi, many (if not most) of them undergo
ontogenetic (age-related) color or pattern changes, especially in
color intensity. Your carefully chosen, hand-picked fish may
develop into a creature with an entirely different appearance from
the one you selected.
Going once, going twice, sold 
at a local koi auction
Most koi clubs have annual or semiannual auctions or raffles to
raise funds for the local club. In most cases, members simply bring
in their excess fish or net some bargains by purchasing another
member’s extra fish.
Chapter 4: A Koi Buyer’s Guide 51

Part I: Koi Basics 
52
Prices for these koi are extremely reasonable. For example, a breeder
at a recent auction reportedly bought a $500 koi for $40. At that
same auction, 6-inch koi sold for $10. If you’re really lucky, you may
hit the jackpot: A club member may want to sell her Japanese-bred
and -hatched koi that have gotten too big for her pond.
The extra advantage of buying at a club auction is being able to
talk to the previous owner to find out what he’s fed his fish, which
ones seem particularly shy, or even how its color developed. For
example, a particular Showa Sanshoku — black koi with white and
red markings — is slow to develop its red coloration.
To find out about clubs and upcoming events in your area, check
one of the popular koi hobbyist magazines or surf the Internet
(search by using your local area and the keywords koi auctions,
koi clubs, and so on.
In addition to the hard cash, these events promote a good amount
of camaraderie. Check out the nearby sidebar “Club auctions:
The best prices in town” for a recent example.
Club auctions: The best prices in town
Recently we attended a neighborhood koi auction hosted by our local koi club. The
auction/cookout was held in the backyard of one of the local club officers, who also
served as chief cook and auctioneer. Along the edge of the yard were a dozen show
tubs holding dozens of koi segregated by size (4 inches to 18 inches or more). About
50 koi-folks were there, some who had traveled more than 100 miles. Everyone was
friendly, polite, and eagerly awaiting the main event.
Compared to other auctions, the sales pitches were tame — almost sedate. The
auctioneer allowed potential purchasers to determine which koi they wished to
have auctioned first. Those fish were gently netted and bowled for everyone to see,
and as they were bowled, the auction took place. Of course, the largest and most
colorful fish went first, and they were remarkably cheap. In fact, most fish sold for
$20 to $50 although a few fetched $100 to $300. At the end of the sale, the more
generic, smaller selections sold for about $25 for a bag of six or more.
After a fish sold, a club member carefully edged it into a plastic bag (some fish were
so large that they were pushing the capacity of the bag!) with enough water to cover
the fish. Each bag was topped off with pure oxygen to assure the fish breathed com-
fortably until it reached its new home.
The actual sale lasted for just over an hour, but the presale jabber and cookout
allowed folks of like interests to get together for a friendly pow-wow about their
hobby. And members who left with a bagged fish in hand also left with an unmis-
takable I-got-a-deal smile on their faces!

Chapter 4: A Koi Buyer’s Guide 53
Surfing (online) for koi
You can spend a lot of money on koi, and with the help of online
purchases and auctions, you can spend that cash very quickly.
The good news is that young koi (from 4 to 8 inches in length) that
you purchase online aren’t expensive.
Actually, we like Internet purchases a bit better than those in the
classified sections of magazines because you can request pictures
of the koi you’re interested in. (Classified ads may also provide a
Web site where you can see the fish, but that seems to be an addi-
tional step for the same results.) Basically, you can purchase koi
online two ways:
 Private koi dealers: These dealers vary greatly in the quality
of their operations and the fish they offer. Because you’re cut-
ting out one step of the usual purchase process, you should
expect to pay less than you would at a store.
You can find online dealers by searching under koi sales and
similar keywords. You may want to narrow your search to
local areas in order to cut shipping costs.
We urge you to find out all you can about a seller’s reliability
and integrity before placing and paying for your order. Most
shippers require advance payment for the fish, its packing, and
the air freight, so the cost can be significant. Ascertain the
honesty of the shipper before the money leaves your account.
 Web site auctions: On an open-bid site, koi owners and sellers
list their fish, post a picture, and mention a monetary reserve
amount (below which the fish will not be sold). Then it’s up to
you, the bidder, to post your bid. And how high can these bids
go? On the AquaBid site (info for this site is in the following
paragraph), you’ll see many ads for very inexpensive koi.
Then again, you may come across an absolutely spectacular koi.
(The one we found most appealing was a 32-inch, 25-pound
Aka Matsuba Ginrin with a modest reserve price of $3,500.)
To get in on the fun of an online auction, click on koi under
freshwater fish at www.aquabid.com.
Just as with online sales, research the koi seller’s reputation
and shipping policies before bidding online.
Going “away” for your koi
If you want to make a trip overseas for your koi, try to join a sales
trip (usually in late October) hosted by a stateside koi importer.
The best way to locate them is through personal connections such

Part I: Koi Basics 
54
as members of your koi club or association. If you don’t have these
connections, talk with importers who advertise in koi magazines or
on the Internet.
By going with an importer who’s dealt with Japanese breeders, you
stand a much better chance of meeting the breeders whose stock
you really want to see. And because your trip leader already knows
the protocol of buying from the Japanese, the prices will be better.
For the inside scoop on buying koi in Japan, check out the sidebar,
“The protocol of viewing and purchasing koi in Japan.”
The protocol of viewing and 
purchasing koi in Japan
The concept of acceptable behavior by customers who are shopping for koi varies
from one culture to another. For example, the Japanese prefer great decorum and
restraint, but the American and European sales events show less restraint.
In today’s hurried and often bellicose times, the Japanese protocol for viewing and
purchasing koi may seem to be in a time warp because they’re based on respect and
politeness — not only for the fish but also for your fellow koi enthusiasts and the
dealer. (Definitely not Wall Street mentality!)
Remember that, just as all koi aren’t created equal, neither are all koi customers (in
the dealers’ eyes). As a result, Japanese koi breeders tend to give familiar and
repeat customers preferential prices.
The following tips may make that first Japanese koi purchase a little easier:
 In most cases the posted price may seem non-negotiable, but if you feel com-
fortable enough to try, never attempt to negotiate in public.
 Always ask the dealer questions about the fish (including price) in private.
Because the dealer may use a sliding scale of pricing (known customers getting
somewhat better prices), asking in public is considered impolite. However, a
dealer may choose to announce the price to the entire crowd.
 If you’re interested in a particular koi, ask the dealer to bowl or tub the fish.
This, of course, allows you a better look at the koi.
 If someone else requests a dealer to bowl a fish for closer viewing, that person
has first choice. In other words, refrain from selecting one of the bowled koi
until the prospective customer releases the koi back into the pond.
 Keep quiet. If you’re a prospective buyer, don’t talk with that customer until the
selection process is completed.
 Hold your horses. Don’t ask the price of the bowled fish until the potential buyer
has declined it by turning it loose in the pond.

Determining What You See 
and What You Get
What kind of koi do you want? Do you want pretty fish for your
pond, or do you want to try your hand at a high-quality koi? (After
all, a show-quality koi doesn’t cost any more to feed than a garden-
variety koi.)
Your first priority is to buy healthy koi that’ll settle down in your
pond and flourish. But knowing whether a koi is unhealthy or likely
to become ill after you get them home can be difficult. Fortunately,
koi have certain fairly simple hallmarks that you can look for to
help you choose both the most pleasing and the healthiest ones
out of the gate. We cover both beauty and health in this section to
help you make the best selections.
Choosing colors and patterns 
to suit your style
If your koi is simply for your viewing pleasure, then the colors and
patterns should simply please you. However, if you have even an
inkling that you’ll want to show your fish some day, you have other
considerations.
For all your koi choices, the colors should be as crisp and clean as
possible. The differences between the show koi and those that are
almost-but-not-quite-for-show koi aren’t obvious to the casual
observer — maybe the red spot on the head isn’t centered, or
the fish has red on the tail fin, or the color blotches may not
have distinct edges. For many koi-keepers, these koi are beautiful
enough.
These non-show-quality koi can be divided into two camps: koi
that are a clearly definable variety with a flaw or two, and just
pretty koi.
But if you’re considering showing your fish, familiarize yourself
with the colors and patterns that are most eagerly sought and rig-
orously defended by the show judges. The fact is, even though you
think your koi’s specking of black in the orange or white fields is
charming, a show judge will consider it a disqualifying feature.
(See Chapter 2 for a brief overview of these ideals.)

Younger koi swim into two categories:
 Tategoi: These are young koi with potential, the offspring of
show-quality koi that promise to develop into show-quality
koi. (Sure, you can get Tategoi from average koi, but that pos-
sibility is as likely as getting a show cocker spaniel out of two
neighborhood cockers.)
How do you know whether you’re really looking at Tategoi
other than the price? Unless you know koi, you don’t. Anyone
can claim they’re selling Tategoi, so you have to be able to
trust your seller.
For example, in 2006 the owners of Happy Koi, a koi-breeding
and -selling business in South Africa, estimated the cost of
their koi-with-promise that they selected from “the best of the
best young koi” during a buying trip to Japan, at $134 each.
They buy these fish for what they expect the fish to become:
“a great deal more — we can’t promise you but these look
very good.”
 Non-show-quality young koi: These young koi are far less
expensive than their Tategoi counterparts, particularly if they
come from local breeders. Expect to pay $15 to $20 for a 4- to
6-inch local non-show koi. Be sure to consider shipping costs
for one that will travel some distance to reach your pond.
Admittedly, you can’t be certain what an adult koi will look like.
Color and pattern are likely to change in some varieties until your
fish reaches adulthood. In fact, juvenile koi are big-headed, angular
little creatures that show very little of the overall grace of a well-
conformed adult.
By the time a koi is 6 or 7 inches long, you usually have some hint
of its conformation. By then it’s out of the angular stage, and its
back, sides, and belly are beginning to curve gracefully. The belly
shouldn’t be distended or bloated. If a koi looks nice at this 6- to 
7-inch-long stage, it’s likely to continue improving.
Considering size: What’s 
right for you?
The right size of koi depends entirely on your wants and your
budget. You can start off with any size koi you like, but be warned:
Like diamonds, big fish always cost more. You can start with
adults, or you can start with smaller koi and watch them grow up.
In a nutshell, there’s no perfect size of koi other than the size that
most appeals to you. (For additional information on starting your

pond, see this chapter’s later section “Best bets for the indecisive:
Advice from yours truly.”)
For the new koi-keeper who wants to start out simply, buy fairly
inexpensive young koi — those 8 inches or less — in groups.
It’s one purchase, one set of negotiations and arrangements,
and instant pond population.
Buying a group of young koi may seem like an easy way to jump-
start your pond — and it is. But those koi are going to grow. If your
pond is already near capacity with koi, adding several new koi is a
bad idea.
You can purchase some brightly colored 6-inch koi for your pond
from a local pond store or an online vendor without busting your
budget. Prices for what’s politely called display-quality, 6-inch koi
run $45 to $75.
If you buy a 10-inch fish directly from the breeder, keep the follow-
ing in mind:
 The fish is probably special if a breeder is willing to maintain it
for three years. Maybe its conformation or color distinguished
it from its littermates.
 The price for a good-quality (but not show-quality), 10-inch
koi in the United States ranges from $85 to $140.
When you’re ready to add some pizzazz to the pond, ramp up your
expenditures. Look for good-looking koi, maybe even some named
varieties, and be selective. Buy what pleases you.
If you ultimately want big fish, consider starting with adults of
18 inches or larger. Koi can live in excess of 30 years, so even if
you buy adults, you’ll still have plenty of time together. You can
buy an adult-size fish from a fish dealer or a fellow koi-keeper; you
can look for show quality or not-show quality. Only your prefer-
ences and budget set the limits.
Selecting healthy koi
Although seeking a fish in A-1 health should be foremost in your
mind (even ahead of color and pattern), this requirement becomes
especially important if the fish must be shipped by air or ride in
a vehicle for several hours. Such handling, even at its best, can
quickly stress out a healthy koi for several days. If the fish is below
par to begin with, the trip can be fatal. Of course, even generic koi
should be free of malformations.
Chapter 4: A Koi Buyer’s Guide 57

Part I: Koi Basics 
58
Before you pick out a particular koi from a group in a quarantine
tub or a dealer’s show tank, look at them as a whole. Consider the
following characteristics about the group:
 Are they oriented vertically in the water? Fish that are ill
may list (tilt) from front to back or side to side. Unless they’re
feeding, the head shouldn’t be oriented toward the bottom of
the tank.
 Do they seem to move easily through the water with no jerk-
iness? Skeletal malformations, swim bladder problems, and a
host of other conditions can disrupt normal swimming patterns.
(See Chapter 13 for more about uncoordinated swimming;
sometimes this can be treated, and sometimes it can’t.)
 Are the fish rubbing themselves on the bottom of the tank
or against objects within the tank? If so, they may be trying
to dislodge parasites.
 Are the koi swimming about in a frenzied fashion, or do
they seem unusually listless? Both behaviors can indicate
water quality problems or disease.
 Are the koi gasping or gulping air at the surface of the
water? This behavior can indicate low oxygen levels (which
eventually stress the fish) or water quality problems.
If the answers to the preceding questions raise any concerns, ask
to see another batch. Better yet, resist your impulsive urge and
find another source. However, if the koi pass the group test with
flying colors, you’re ready to take a closer look.
Ask to have the fish you like bowled, and then look at it for a few
minutes in the bowl. Before you fall in love with its color or its pat-
tern, get steely-eyed about its health. Expensive or not, buying an
unhealthy fish makes no sense. As you give the koi a good inspec-
tion, ask yourself the following questions. If you answer “Yes” to
any of them, move on to another fish, tank, or supplier.
 Does the fish have any rough spots? Do its scales seem to puff
out away from the body?
Koi whose scales stand out from their body like a bas-relief
may be exhibiting pinecone scale, a symptom of an overall
internal infection, or enteritis, which causes such pressure
from within that the fish actually bloats, pushing the scales
out. This symptom is a very bad sign. (See Chapter 13 for
more on this problem, but first, go wash your hands.)

 Is it missing part of a fin or part of its tail?
 Looking at the overall proportions of the fish, do you notice
any stubby parts?
 Is its mouth asymmetrical or its snout sharply pointed?
 As the fish swims past you, is one side of the body wider or
more curved than the other, rendering the fish asymmetrical in
appearance? Does the tail curve up or wiggle to one side only?
 Are the eyes cloudy or protrude abnormally?
You can also ask the dealer to bag the fish. When it’s in the bag,
you can examine the koi’s mouth, underside, and tail. Signs of
infection, such as fuzzy, grayish, or white patches, may appear
on the lower aspects of the koi and aren’t otherwise easy to see.
(See Chapter 13 to find out more about koi illnesses.)
Fish that look healthy may still carry external parasite eggs that
won’t hatch until conditions are right. Be aware that transferring
the fish to a new pond may give these eggs the opening they need
to proliferate, particularly if the fish has been in a cool pond and is
moved to your warmer pond. This problem doesn’t mean you
bought an unhealthy fish or that the vendor’s a crook. No treat-
ment kills external parasite eggs. For the treatment of parasites
and other koi problems, check out the details in Chapter 13.
Best bets for the indecisive: 
Advice from yours truly
If you’re just starting your koi-keeping hobby, start with a small
group of inexpensive, brightly colored koi, the kind you can readily
find at garden shops, online, or from a breeder. (Not every fish
from a breeder is a champion or even show quality. Breeders are
happy to sell these average-Joe fish.)
Even after you’re well versed in the hobby, these canary koi
(so called because they test your knowledge and the survival 
conditions in your pond) may be all you need to keep you happy.
Certainly they place far less strain on your pocketbook than even
the cheapest named varieties. And those little generic koi need a
place to live, grow, and age as much as their more expensive
brethren do. Note: The good news — or bad news — is that
generic koi usually don’t reach the jumbo sizes of the more exotic,
line-bred, Japanese koi.
Chapter 4: A Koi Buyer’s Guide 59

Part I: Koi Basics 
60
If and when you decide to buy some of the identifiable varieties of
koi (see Chapter 2 for these), we recommend that you start with
these three:
 Kohaku (red and white): This variety is the most popular koi,
particularly in Japan.
 Sanke (white with a red and black pattern): This is the
second most popular variety.
 Showa (looks like the Sanke, but it’s black with a red and
white pattern): The Showa is the surprise koi, the one whose
pattern can change as it gets older. People tend to like it
because of its unpredictability.
Showa is also most prone to mouth deformities and a bad
head shape.
Buying Koi “To Go”
When you buy koi from a distant breeder or vendor, the fish are
shipped to you on an agreed-upon date. If you’re actually visiting
the vendor and want to take the fish home with you, you and the
vendor decide the best time for you to return for your bagged fish.
Part of the discussion also includes the kind of payment the breeder
or vendor desires. Expect to use a credit card or cash, particularly
if you’re dealing with a vendor who’s out of state or in another
country.
In the koi world, delay between the purchase and acquisition of
your fish is standard operating procedure. The buying of koi is 
supposed to be a pleasant event for both the buyer and the seller,
not just an exchange of money for a fish. Part of the process is a
discussion with the breeder or seller about:
 The koi’s present diet
 How many days the fish will fast before shipment (so their
digestive systems are clear and don’t gunk up the water in
their shipping bag)
 What happens if the fish get sick before they’re shipped
Although these topics sound touchy, they’re common topics in the
koi-selling business.

etting ready for your first koi is like waiting for the holidays.
You can’t wait for the date, but you have so much to do first!
This chapter is a step-by-step guide that helps you prepare your
koi’s first home, lists the supplies you need on Day One, explains
how to get little Gill from point A to point B, and then swims you
through the release of your new fish into its new digs. Later in the
chapter we explain the differences between buying koi from Japan
and buying them locally (trust us, you’re going to need this info
someday) and the details of setting up a quarantine tub (trust us
again, you’re going to want one of these).
Deciding Where Your Koi Will Live
(Temporarily or For Always)
You have a number of options for housing your koi, each with
advantages and disadvantages. Following is a brief overview of the
most common types of dwelling places; details of establishing the
habitats come later in the chapter.
 Aquarium: An aquarium gives you good visibility of small koi,
particularly if the tank is on a waist-high stand. One reason
some koi-keepers like to keep their young butterfly koi in a
tank is because these koi are such graceful swimmers.

Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
64
If you go the aquarium route, look for a breeding tank rather
than a show tank. Breeding tanks are lower and longer and
give your koi a greater swim range. Show tanks are more verti-
cally oriented.
Koi can jump (even the little ones) especially when they
enter unfamiliar surroundings, so add a cover for the tank.
The limited size of an aquarium means it can’t be a long-term
choice.
 Inside pond: Indoor ponds offer a better home for your koi than
an aquarium tank by providing enough room for your koi to
swim. Usually located near a home’s entryway or den area,
these ponds are attractive accessories in their own right.
Most of these ponds are less than 2 feet deep and include
bottom drains, a concealed water spigot, stone seating around
the edge (for you, not the fish!), and a small fountain or water-
fall for sound.
Even though your indoor pond is shallow, be sure yours is
inaccessible to unsupervised children.
 Outside pond: This pond is the ultimate koi home, offering
design options not available to aquariums or most indoor
ponds. When properly designed, an outside pond allows you
to watch your koi grow to their full size.
Taking Necessary Precautions:
Preparing the Quarantine Tub
When you buy koi from another koi-keeper or at a local auction,
you’re tempting fate if you don’t quarantine them first. Plan to
quarantine the koi before they enter their permanent home
(no matter what type of aquarium or pond you have) for these
important reasons:
 The new koi’s immune system can be affected by
• The stress of bagging and transporting.
• Exposure to higher or lower water temperatures.
• Exposure to different pH levels.
 Pathogens that normally wouldn’t affect your new fish sud-
denly proliferate.
Quarantining involves isolating your new fish in their own tub for
up to 21 days. During this time you observe them, feed them
lightly, and provide a little preventive treatment, even when dis-
ease is not apparent. If you live in the north and buy koi in the

Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Koi’s Homecoming 65
dead of winter, your new koi spend at least a month in the quaran-
tine pond until your outdoor pond warms up.
Later in this chapter we give you all the details of the process, but
in this section we first show you how to prepare the quarantine tub.
You can avoid quarantining if you get your fish from a local dealer
who routinely quarantines his fish before he offers them for sale.
Just ask the dealer before you buy. You still need to adjust the fish
gradually to your pond to avoid temperature and pH shock, but at
least you can be reasonably sure that they’re healthy.
What you need for the job
The quarantine tub has to be separate from your pond — no
shared air hoses, pumps, filters, or nets.
The basic tub can be
 A show tank (a self-standing vinyl tank with a PVC framework
about 6 feet wide and 30 inches deep)
 A small, above-ground, vinyl swimming pool
 A big polyethylene stock tank
Deciding what size of tub to use is a juggling act. A large tub is
good for large koi and for maintaining relatively stable water 
chemistry and temperatures. A smaller tub, however, is better for
closely observing your koi and medicating an entire tub. Your koi
dealer or members of a local koi club can advise you on where to
purchase various types of tubs.
Your tub needs the following equipment and materials, most of
which you can get from your local pet or pond store:
 Air system consisting of
• Air pump
• Airline tubing
• Airstone (a big one, 12 inches long)
 A bottom drain
 Blue insulation foam (the kind you buy in 4-x-8-foot sheets
from home improvement stores)
You need one piece large enough to fit directly under the tub
and enough other sheets to form an insulating jacket around
the sides of the tub.
 Dechlorinator/dechloraminator (at least one gallon)

 Filter
 Heater
 Netting (the kind you use to keep birds away from fruit trees)
The netting keeps the koi from hopping out of the tub.
 Salt (a couple of pounds non-iodized)
Kosher salt (available at most supermarkets) makes the best
tonic for your koi, helping them deal with minor skin issues
and external parasites.
 Support equipment such as nets, siphons, and buckets
 Tape (masking and packing or duct tape)
 Tub thermometer
 Water pump with a capacity of 240 to 400 gallons per hour
 Water test kit for ammonia, nitrates, and salt
Along with the necessary equipment, consider spending extra
money for the following items to make the maintenance easier
for you and the quarantine period easier on your fish:
 Add-on bottom drains: These drains install with a 2-inch PVC
pipe over the tub edge. No need to empty the tub one bucket
at a time or siphon the good old-fashioned way.
 Bead filter: This filter provides mechanical and biofiltration in
one small footprint; cleaning and back flushing are fast and easy.
 Salt meter: This meter eliminates the guesswork in keeping
the water at 3 percent salt.
 Shop lights: If the tub is indoors in a windowless area, install
shop lights with paired full-spectrum UVA and UVB fluores-
cent bulbs over the tub. The lights help you see what you’re
doing, and they help minimize the fading of your koi’s colors.
Your usual supplier of pond products has (or can order) the bead
filter and salt meter and possibly the other items. If necessary, you
can purchase the lights and PVC pipes at most home improvement
stores.
Rub-a-dub-dub, setting up the tub
Plan to set up your quarantine tub a few weeks before your new
fish arrive. You need this time to install the mechanical parts (air
pump, heater [particularly if the pond is outside], water pump, and
filter). The new filtration media also need a week or so to acquire
the beneficial nitrifying bacteria.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
66

But — before you can do anything — you have to decide where to
put the darn tub. If you can protect it from the elements, you may
want it beside your house, or you can place it in a basement.
Remember to consider these factors:
 You want to be able to work easily with the tub and your fish.
 The tub needs to be near a source of fresh water because
you’ll be changing out 20 to 30 percent of the water each day.
 The discarded water needs to go into your sewer or septic
system (It’s 3 percent salt, which isn’t good for lawns or
streams.)
After you’ve chosen your tub’s location, follow these steps:
1. Put a layer of the blue insulation foam directly on the
ground or flooring.
2. Put the tub on top of the blue foam and add more sections
of the foam to form a jacket around the tub. Trim the
excess with a serrated knife and use masking tape to tem-
porarily hold the jacket together; use packing tape or
duct tape to permanently hold the sections together.
The base and jacket help control the tub’s water 
temperature.
3. Add the bottom drain over the edge and hook the filter
up to the drain pipes.
4. Add the water pump inline after the filter and place its
outflow pipe over the edge of the tub (opposite the drain
pipe if possible).
5. Fill the tub with water to 6 inches from the upper edge.
Use water from your pond for at least part of this fill in
order to populate the filter with friendly bacteria (this
takes a week or so). Dechlorinate any water that comes
from your municipal water supply.
6. Turn on the pump and make sure all joints are tight.
7. Add salt if you’re using it.
8. Check to make sure the shop light is the right height.
The light needs to be low enough to give good light but
high enough so you don’t crown yourself every time you
lean over to look at your koi.
9. If you’re using a heater, turn it on a day or so before you
add your koi. Check water temps after three hours of
operation and make certain they’re within acceptable
levels (75–80 degrees).
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Koi’s Homecoming 67

Shopping for Initial Supplies
Before you bring your new love(s) to their watery home, be sure
you have all the necessary supplies. The following is a quick list to
get you started:
 Koi food: Because feeding your fish is so important, we devote
a whole chapter (Chapter 11) to navigating the nutrition aisle
at your local pet store. Needless to say, you need the chow
before your fish makes it out of the bag.
 Non-iodized salt: Keep a couple of pounds of this stuff on
hand in addition to the amount for setting up the quarantine
tub. (Kosher salt is best.) It’s your koi’s best tonic in dealing
with minor skin issues and external parasites.
 A water-testing kit: You need a kit separate from the one for
your quarantine tub so you can check the pond’s water levels
regularly for nitrites, nitrates, salt, pH, and chlorine. (Yes, you
can tote your pond kit back and forth, but we suggest you
avoid the hassle.)
 Floating koi bowl: In case you need to examine a koi closely
without taking it out of the water, a floating koi bowl allows
you to scoop up the fish and confine it within the pond or
tank for a short time.
 Round koi net: This net helps you guide koi into the
floating bowl.
 Sock net: This narrow net has mesh at each end and a solid
portion in the middle. The end of the net is open.
Helpful for transporting koi when the trip from the bag to
the pond is more than a lift and a swing, the net supports the
fish’s weight during transfers and can immobilize the fish in
the water while you examine its face, gill plates, and tail
through the mesh. To release the fish, just lower the net, take
your hand off the open end, and let your fish swim through.
 A gallon of dechlorinator/dechloraminator: Keep a gallon on
hand in addition to the amount for the tub and pond setup.
Just as people prepare for their own emergencies, you want to
be prepared for your koi’s most common illnesses and mishaps.
Grab a box of your choosing, label it Koi’s First-Aid Kit, and fill it
with the following:
 Ammonia remover to reduce high levels of this toxic waste
product
 Cotton swabs to dab medicine onto cuts or fungus
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
68

 Dechlorinator to render tap water safe for the koi
 Dimilin or Program (yes, the same product you use on your
dog for fleas) for fish lice and anchor worms
 Eugenol to use as a fish anesthetic
 Fluke Tabs or potassium permanganate to get rid of flukes on
the koi’s gills or body
Fluke Tabs cost more but they’re easier to use.
 Hydrogen peroxide to clean wounds and disable potassium
permanganate (see previous reference) in the pond if you
accidentally use too much
It’s also useful as a temporary aerator if your pond’s power
goes out.
 Microscope with slides and slide covers to inspect the cells
of a sick fish
Very serviceable microscopes cost less than $250. Look for one
with 40x, 100x, and 400x magnification, a built-in light source,
and a mechanical stage adaptor that scans the entire smear.
 Kosher salt to treat minor skin injuries
 Tweezers to remove large external parasites
 Water test kits for pH, salinity, ammonia, alkalinity, nitrites,
and dissolved oxygen levels
You can find most of these items at your local pet or pond supply
store. The fish-related items are also readily available online. Buy
microscopes through biological supply houses or online (some-
times you can find a used microscope that’ll do the job).
You may already have some of these items from setting up your
pond (the salt, dechlorinator, and water test kit, for example). If so,
consider yourself ahead of the game. (Pass Go! Collect $200.)
Getting Your Koi Home
Of course you’ll be anxious to get your first koi home in a hurry.
However, the process is quite important and requires some fore-
thought on your part to help your fish arrive safely.
Bringing home local koi
When you buy from your local garden shop or breeder, you get
instant gratification — simply pick out the koi you like and take
them home.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Koi’s Homecoming 69

No matter where you buy the fish, the process is the same:
1. Small koi (less than 6 inches long) are netted out directly
and bagged. Larger koi are urged into a show bowl with
a koi net; the bowl and contents are then poured into a
large plastic bag at the surface of the pond or bin.
The dealer adds enough water to fully cover the body of
the fish.
2. Usually the dealer tops off the bag with compressed
oxygen and closes it with a rubber band.
3. He places the plastic bag(s) in paper bags to provide at
least partial darkness.
This darkness helps reduce the stress that the koi experi-
ence during transport. The dealer may provide a box to
prevent the bags from rolling about during transport, but
bring your own just to be safe (a Styrofoam cooler works
well). You can also pack newspaper around the bags to
cushion the fish and help prevent excess movement.
Keep the bags cool on your way home because the small amount of
water in the bags can heat up quickly. The best way to keep the
bags cool is to pack them in a Styrofoam or plastic cooler. Ice isn’t
necessary, but do include a container of cold water if you’re using
public transportation during particularly hot weather.
Shipping your koi
If you purchase koi from a source that’s not local (whether it’s
Japan — lucky you! — or another state), you may need to have
the fish shipped.
Booking the flight
Be forewarned: Expect to pay at least $100 in air freight/cargo
charges (domestic flights). These charges are based on volume or
weight (which ever is greater), and koi-plus-water can be heavy.
Also keep the following warnings in mind when booking your fish’s
flight home:
 Oversea fish must enter the United States at a port of entry.
These are in major transport hubs such as Los Angeles,
Miami, and Chicago.
 Be mindful of the flight time. When you or another person
books the flight, make sure the fish are on the shortest, most
direct flight possible.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
70

The on-ground time is actually the most stressful. As the
cargo bin doors open, the outside temperature rushes in.
Shipments with a connecting flight must spend transfer time
on the tarmac, where they’re exposed to local temperatures.
 Avoid dangerous weather scenarios. Check the weather fore-
cast at the originating site, at the final destination, and at any
intermediate sites for the flight.
Don’t plan to ship when snow storms are expected or when
temperatures may be over 90 degrees. Even if the airline
accepts your shipment, you’re still subjecting your koi to tem-
perature extremes that are beyond unhealthy. Do your own
weather research.
Transporting the fish
The good news is that breeders and koi sellers know how to ship
koi by air, so you don’t have to worry about them goofing up. They
also know how to keep track of orders; you don’t get a Tancho
when you ordered a Bekko.
1. The seller takes digital photos of each fish before she
readies the fish for shipping.
The high-end nature of the nishikigoi business generally
assures extreme care in shipping details, but mistakes in
identification of specific fish do occur (some Kohaku tend
to look very much alike). In that case, the breeder has the
responsibility of getting the correct fish to the correct
buyer (hence the digital photos as a sort of verifying meas-
ure). If a mistake is made, the breeder must make arrange-
ments for selling the koi to a dealer or individual in the
United States.
2. The seller isolates the fish in large show tanks and then
places them in large plastic bags. These bags are like the
ones for tropical fish except they’re 3 millimeters rather
than 1⁄4 millimeter thick.
3. The seller places the koi-in-a-bag in a cardboard box lined
with pieces of Styrofoam and then closes the box flaps.
4. At the airport, the breeder or the representative takes
care of the paperwork and the koi are loaded into the
cargo bin of the jet.
5. When the koi arrive at a port of entry in the United
States, they’re inspected by United States Customs and
Fish and Wildlife Service to make certain the shipment
and the paperwork match.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Koi’s Homecoming 71

Imported fish also incur the expense of a customshouse
broker who makes certain all the paperwork is in order.
Check with the local United States Fish and Wildlife Service
(800-344-9453) ahead of time about arranging for a broker;
practices vary from place to place.
6. The new owner compares the fish to the digital photos
sent by the agent to make sure they’re the same fish.
After You Get Home-Sweet-Home
The process of transporting your fish to your home is one of the
most stressful events in a koi’s life. But settling into a new home
with different water quality and surroundings is another hurdle
that the fish faces. Proceed slowly and carefully at this point so
you don’t add to your koi’s stress.
Easing your fish from bag 
to quarantine tub
When your fish arrive at your nearby airport, either you pick them
up from the cargo area or a delivery service (like Delta DASH)
brings them to your door. Now that your koi are finally inside your
home, you can start to enjoy the rest of the process.
Open the box carefully and lift the bags out. Follow these steps to
help your new pal adjust to his temporary abode:
1. Float the plastic bag(s) on the quarantine tub’s surface for
15 minutes while you wait for temperatures to equalize.
This time period is reasonably safe, but if you’re unsure, do
a quick check with a thermometer.
If the fish are gasping at the top of the bag when you first
open the box, open the bags and hold the bags open as
they float in the quarantine tub. If the fish stop gasping,
you can re-tie the bags. If the water in the bag is very warm,
however, you may need to hold the bags open until the
temperatures equalize.
The only reasons for the gasping behavior under these con-
ditions are a pre-existing illness, a lack of oxygen, or over-
heating during transport.
If the fish are lethargic and floating on their sides in the
bag, open the bags at once and add some tub water to the
plastic bag. Hold the opened plastic bag upright in the

quarantine tub for five minutes for temperature adjust-
ment. Then lift your fish out and release them into the tub.
2. After 15 minutes, open the bags and check the pH of both
containers with your water test kit.
If the difference between the two waters is greater than 0.2
(6.9 and 7.3, for instance), add some of the water from the
quarantine tub to the plastic bags and retest. (You may
want to enlist someone to help out in this process because
you need more than two hands to hold the bags open at
the water’s surface as you test and make the necessary
adjustments.)
3. At the end of 20 minutes, reach down into the bag, place
your hands under the fish, gently lift it from the bag, and
release it into the tub.
Your hands must be wet and close to the side of the tub so
the koi perceive the bulk of the tub as part of the blockade.
Keep the lift low so the fish lands in the water if it wiggles
free. Figure 5-1 shows how to correctly hold koi during
the move.
A fish’s slimey coat protects it from infection and attack by
micro-organisms. Never pick up a fish with a towel or use
anything rough on its skin.
Figure 5-1: How to hold koi.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Koi’s Homecoming 73

Don’t empty the water from the bag into your quarantine
tub. A bit of incidental spillage probably won’t cause any
problems, but the tub has clean water, and the bag doesn’t.
4. Cover the tub with netting, turn out the lights, and give
the fish a couple of hours to adjust.
Let the quarantine begin!
The majority of koi-keepers who use quarantine feel it’s a time for
the fish to get used to the new home, a new diet, a new owner, and
slightly different but well-controlled water chemistry. To help fish
acclimate to the new surroundings, follow this quarantining process:
1. For the next three weeks, observe the koi.
Be sure each fish is feeding (this may take a day or two
because the fish are undoubtedly nervous in their new sur-
roundings) and swimming about normally. Be particularly
alert for signs of stress, disease, or parasitic infestation
(gasping at the surface or rubbing along the sides of the tub).
See Chapter 13 for a more complete discussion of koi ail-
ments and treatments.
2. Make the daily water changes (20 to 30 percent) while
keeping the water temperature about 72 degrees; add
dechlor after every water change.
Koi immune systems are at their peak at a water temperature
of 72 degrees, but some pathogens can’t function outside of
40 to 60 degrees. Because your new koi’s immune system
will be stressed by the adjustment to its new home, keep
the quarantine temperature at approximately 72 degrees so
these pathogens don’t take hold.
If disease symptoms appear, you need to do some diagnostics
(see Chapter 13) and call on your koi friends or your veterinarian.
Note: We mention veterinarians second because only a few veteri-
narians are trained and experienced in koi medicine. When you’re
feeling your way through a new process, it’s reassuring to have
someone with experience peer over the edge of your tub and say
with delight, “Ah, anchor worms!” At least then you know where to
begin your research for treatment.
Having top-notch water conditions in the quarantine tub is crucial
for reducing the stress on the fish and providing optimal healing
conditions.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
74

Don’t switch between your koi pond and your quarantine tub 
without washing your hands or using Roccal (an inexpensive, 
noncorrosive, colorless antiseptic for aquaria worldwide). Fish that
are already in your pond may carry micro-organisms that, although
harmless to healthy, well-adjusted koi, can wreak havoc on stressed
koi. Even if you don’t have fish in your pond yet, you do have a host
of bacteria and other pathogens there, and they can cause illness
in koi with compromised immune systems.
Some koi-keepers deliberately stress fish under quarantine by
1. Gradually decreasing the water temperature to 60 degrees
for three days.
2. Gradually increasing the water temperature to 75 to
80 degrees.
3. Holding the water at that temperature for three days.
If pathogens are present, they almost certainly become active
during one of the temperature fluctuations, and the koi-keeper can
then treat the disease. Salting is usually enough of a treatment. 
Other koi-keepers routinely add MelaFix to the tub per the 
manufacturer’s recommended dosage and skip any temperature
manipulation. (MelaFix is an antibacterial extract that you can 
purchase at most pet or pond supply stores.)
Transferring koi into the 
aquarium or pond
Your pond is in. You’ve manicured the setting and prepared the
water. (We’re assuming you skipped ahead to read Chapters 6
through 8 before bringing home your koi!) You’ve also spent con-
siderable time sitting on the deck overlooking your koi-palace-to-
be. You’re ready.
When you’re confident that your new koi are healthy at the end of
their three-week quarantine, you can finally introduce your royal
swimmers to their aquatic castle.
Koi can go directly from quarantine tub to pond if the pH values
and temperatures are close (0.2 range for pH, 5 degrees for 
temperature).
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Koi’s Homecoming 75

If you’re using an outside pond, keep in mind that the water must
be 70 degrees or higher. Adding a new fish to a too-cold pond shuts
down the fish’s immune system exactly when he needs it the most.
If the water isn’t warm enough, leave your koi in its quarantine tub
until warmer weather arrives.
The pond temperature is likely to be different from your quaran-
tine tub’s temperature. Take a few precautions to avoid stressing
your fish:
1. Turn off the heater in the quarantine tub and let the tub
reach room temperature overnight.
You want less than a 10-degree difference between pond
and tub temperatures so your fish aren’t shocked.
2. The next morning, if the tub and pond temperatures are
more than 5 degrees apart, you need to bag and float
your koi in the pond.
• Use your koi net to bowl your koi (take the handle
extension off your net if you’re inside).
• Pour the bowl into a waiting and partially submerged
poly bag or lift your koi into the bag. You want just
enough water in the bag to cover the fish so the bag
isn’t too heavy. Rubber-band the bag closed and lift
the bag out of the tub.
3. Carry the bag to your aquarium or pond, ease it into
the water, and let it float for 20 minutes to equalize the
temperatures.
Keep an eye on the bag(s). Don’t let them heat up in the sun.
4. Open the bag, lift out your koi, and release it.
Oh, happy day!

Chapter 6
Planning Your Koi Pond
In This Chapter
 Thinking through pond problems and options upfront
 Choosing your pool materials and shape
 Settling on the perfect location for your pond
 Filtering out your choices
K
oi fanciers joke that there are three certainties in life; an out-
door koi pond is one of them. A garden pond adds a whole
new dimension to koi-keeping. Only small fish can stay indoors,
and as they outgrow their tank, you have to find something to do
with them. A pond offers the option of keeping koi long term so
you can watch them grow and begin to understand their individual
ways. In short, it allows you to make real pets of these fascinating
fish. If you’re serious about koi and want to give them an enriching
environment, then a pond is really the only way to go.
This chapter helps you decide whether a pond is the logical next
step for you and, if so, how to plan for one. We discuss the planning
process, including where to locate your pond and what options
you have for size, style, and materials. (We cover the supplies to
run the pond in Chapter 3.) To give you an accurate picture, we
also examine the legalities of pool construction as well as the
potential problems you may encounter.
Considerations to Toss Around
Before You Dig
In making a major decision, it’s a good idea to check out all the
angles and consider the consequences of that decision. But a koi
pond? That’s easy enough. It’s a simple structure with a simple
purpose. How complicated can this choice be?
This section helps you answer that important question by high-
lighting three potential problems that may affect your choice.

Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
78
Then we take a look at your existing pond or pool so you can
decide whether you can adapt it for your koi.
Avoiding potential problems
Adding a koi pond is much more detailed than simply digging a
hole in the ground, putting in water, and allowing the koi to swim
to their hearts’ content. When you’re contemplating a pond, con-
sider two potential problem sources — small children’s safety and
your neighbors’ concerns — before you even start digging.
Safety is key: Small children and small animals
Koi ponds are irresistible to adults and children. Who doesn’t love
those big, friendly fish that come right up to the water’s edge at
feeding time? Unfortunately, unfenced koi ponds and small chil-
dren just don’t mix. Each year children drown in water as shallow
as a few inches, so a pond of any size is a major hazard.
The area around the pond and any protruding rocks can be wet
and slick due to algae; both adults and children can easily slip and
fall. If the fall results in the person becoming unconscious, a
drowning can easily result.
Also consider the dangers for the mentally challenged or physi-
cally infirm persons who may gain access to the pond. Although
pet dogs and cats are usually sensible around water, tortoises and
guinea fowl have been known to drown even in shallow outdoor
ponds.
Whether the safety issues are yours or a neighbor’s, don’t quibble.
Add a fence, even if it isn’t required, and tell your neighbors why
you’re doing it. That way you all know you’ve done what you can
to prevent the unmentionable.
Considering your neighbors’ concerns
Next-door neighbors have a vested interest in your yard, or they
think they do. This attitude is especially true if they have safety
concerns (see the previous section). Your neighbor may also be
worried that the pond can become a breeding ground for mosqui-
toes (consider the media attention given to the West Nile Virus).
Occasionally ponds draw raccoons, ducks, or other animals that
may annoy neighbors — even loud frog choruses have been a
source of complaints. When you tell your neighbors you’re thinking
about building a koi pond in your yard, you can remind them that
the pond will be behind a fence. If the circumstances were
reversed, you’d appreciate the heads-up.

Chapter 6: Planning Your Koi Pond 79
Cutting your way through 
the red tape
If you’re seriously considering a koi pond, get ready to jump
through some hoops at your city or county municipal building.
Before you can break ground, you have to obtain the appropriate
permits from your local municipality.
How to acquire the right permits
To ensure that you cover all your bases and don’t have any prob-
lems with your city or county, you first have to make an important
choice:
 Hire a contractor to build the pond for you. One of this
person’s responsibilities is to obtain all the necessary permits.
(Check out Chapter 7 for more info on hiring a contractor.)
 Do it yourself. If you build the pond, you need to acquire all
the necessary permits and file the appropriate paperwork.
When going it alone, keep these important steps in mind for
acquiring the permits:
1. Call or e-mail your municipal planning and zoning
department and the building department.
In some areas, these departments go under different names
or their functions are combined. Usually a zoning depart-
ment is a good place to start. If your city or county has a
general help line (for example, 311 in New York City), you
can check there for specifics on how to proceed.
Ask whether your city or county has code restrictions on
ponds in general, on their size or depth, and on their place-
ment. (For example, does it need to be set back from prop-
erty lines? Can it be in the front yard or backyard?) If you
need permits, ask what kind and what their costs are.
2. Keep a log of whom you talk to, the date you talk to that
person, and what he says.
Keeping track of which department needs which permit
can be confusing; when you’re talking about a $5,000+ 
project, you’re talking about real money.
Dealing with city or county regulations isn’t too expensive. Permits
are generally based on the estimated cost of the construction, usu-
ally $65 to $125 each. Your only real expense is your time, but it’s
time well spent if you can avoid cease and desist orders (C and Ds

that your municipality issues in response to projects without per-
mits), expensive fines, and liens. Municipalities can and do play
hardball on construction regulations.
Why the permits are important
Getting the appropriate permits (and the ensuing inspections) pro-
tects you in three ways:
 If someone in your neighborhood decides that she doesn’t
like the idea of a pond — in your yard or anywhere in the free
world — having the necessary permits in your hand saves you
a lot of trouble.
 The inspections that are part of the process assure everyone
that you’re building to code. In addition, this built-in safety
factor can pretty much guarantee that you won’t get electro-
cuted by your wiring system.
 If you decide to sell your house, any construction without a
permit (even on something as elegant as a koi pond) can be
cause to void a sales contract. It’ll also make you look (and
feel) like a cheap schmuck.
Your local city or county municipality rep can tell you which per-
mits are required. Typically, you need an electrical permit for your
pump and filters and a plumbing permit for water and gas lines.
You may or may not need a fencing permit, but a fence is generally
a very good idea.
Some cities suggest that you include a site plan with the permit
applications so the issuing officer has a better understanding of
the construction. You can sketch this plan out yourself, or you can
use a software program (very reasonably priced). The program lets
you enter your yard shape and dimension, your pond shape and
dimensions, and various design elements. You end up with a print-
out of your pond and its location in your yard. Very cool.
What if you already have 
a pond (or pool)?
If you’re seriously considering a koi pond for your yard and
already have a shallow goldfish pond (or a cement hot tub), you
may be in luck. You can probably adapt the goldfish pond to a koi
pond by digging it deeper or by adding a larger and deeper pond
next to it and knocking out the intervening wall.
Even if your existing pool isn’t as large as recommended for koi
(6 x 9 feet), you can make a small pool deeper to house at least a
few fish.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
80

The real advantage of making a pre-existing shallow pool much
deeper (a minimum of 4 feet is recommended) is to keep koi in
a relatively small space. Plan to add plumbing for the bottom
drain(s) and a raised lip (if the pond doesn’t already have a ledge).
See Chapter 7 for an illustration of a raised lip.
Can you turn a swimming pool into a koi pond? In a word, yes, but
you need to make a few changes. You need to
 Remove the ladder(s) and fill the holes left by the screws
 Give away the container of chlorine
 Round the corners of the pool
(Check out Chapter 7 for instructions on converting a pool into a
koi pond.)
Deciding to take it indoors: Knowing
what you’re taking on
If you’re seriously considering an indoor home for your koi, the
location of your koi’s indoor home is an important but often over-
looked consideration. It needs to meet several criteria:
 The floor below the pond or aquarium must be suitably
sturdy. Even the smallest possible aquarium, 50 gallons, weighs
in excess of 600 pounds when filled with water and gravel.
 If you use an aquarium stand, it must be level and topped
by a sheet of cork or foam. Even minor pressure points can
cause a crack to develop.
 A source of electricity should be close by. Ideally, the outlet
is off to one side so accidental spills can’t touch it.
 You must allow space for your filter. Otherwise, you’re in big
trouble.
 Your koi’s home should be in a quiet location away from
windows.
Fish may react to water-borne vibrations from televisions and
slamming doors. Consider also whether the noise from the
filter may disturb your home’s residents; plan accordingly.
Sunlight through windows can foster the growth of algae and
raise water temperatures in a nearby aquarium or pond.
 You may need flood insurance. Considering the damage that
the water from a 200-gallon tank can cause, flood insurance
may be a wise choice.
Chapter 6: Planning Your Koi Pond 81

Planning for weather changes 
with an outdoor pond
A pond heater and cover can keep your koi at least marginally
active during cold weather. You can buy the parts separately and
install them yourself, or you can purchase self-contained units that
hold the gas boiler, circulator, expansion tank, temperature con-
trol, and temperature sensor all in one. You may want to retrofit
one of these units into your current filtration system, but consider
adding a single custom-built unit to take care of UV sterilization, 
filtration, and heat. It may be well worth your time and money.
In the heat of summer, you can cool a pond with water movement,
a waterfall, a water fountain, or trickling water down a flume (add
bog plants to a flume to take up nitrates). As the water moves and
is exposed to air, evaporative cooling takes place.
Looking at Your Pond Options
When planning your koi pond, you have many options. However,
the three most common types of designs are concrete-block wall
ponds, liner-alone ponds, and concrete-block walls with liner.
This section looks more closely at these three types to help you
decide which one is right for you and your koi. After you decide,
check out Chapter 7 for the building specifics on these ponds.
Choosing your material
Koi ponds have come a long way since the first mud ponds in
Japan, and you need to decide from the beginning whether you
want a concrete pond or a liner pond.
Concrete ponds
Concrete ponds are a serious investment, but many koi-keepers
feel that the advantages more than offset the extra cost. Consider
the following pluses:
 Largely a one-time expense
 Instantly beautiful; small additions (such as a marble, tile, slate,
or brick pond edge) make them even more visually appealing
 Durable (can’t be punctured by the weight of the water push-
ing against stones or buried sticks); cracks can be patched
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
82

Because concrete ponds are rigid systems, they have to be strong
enough to deal with frost heaves and mobile soils (like sugar sand
or clay). You can’t scrimp with a concrete pond, so you’ll want to
budget for the raw materials (the concrete and rebar) from the
start. In cold climates, the concrete needs to be at least 6 inches
thick and reinforced with wire mesh and rods.
Taking a long-range view, you can transform your concrete pond
into a swimming pool by simply changing the color of the interior
coating and switching to a different filtration system. This is a
practical alternative if you ever move or decide that you no longer
want to take care of koi.
Liner ponds
Liners are made from flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Although
the liners are available in several thicknesses, the minimum for
pond construction is 20 millimeter, single ply. Be sure that the liner
is rated fish grade because there are several types of flexible PVC
and some are toxic to fish or plants.
In regard to durability, 20 millimeter PVC has a lifetime of approxi-
mately 10 years, but 32 millimeter PVC can last 15 to 20 years.
Butyl rubber liners aren’t very common in the United States, but
they’re well worth searching for. Long popular in Europe, butyl
rubber liners are 30 millimeters thick, are unaffected by sunlight,
and can last 50 years or more. However, butyl rubber can cost up
to twice as much as PVC and is more difficult to repair.
Liner ponds are by far the most economical of all pond types
because you essentially have no assembly work. Consider these
other advantages:
 Placing a liner takes a bit of work, but it’s still faster (and
easier!) than building a concrete pond.
 Liners are usually one piece (which lessens the chance of a
leak), but you need to install them carefully to minimize folds
and areas of stagnant water, which create anaerobic pockets.
Fresh, oxygenated water can’t circulate to these pockets, so
harmful anaerobic bacteria (those that can’t live in the pres-
ence of oxygen) take hold, causing foul odors and decreasing
the water quality.
 Although sunlight hastens the breakdown of a liner, the liner
membrane isn’t typically exposed to sunlight.
 If the liner springs a leak, you may be able to patch it or drain
it and lay a new liner atop the old one.
Chapter 6: Planning Your Koi Pond 83

Liners do have a downside: Over time, the surrounding ground
tends to shift, causing the liner to shift as well. Those neat vertical
sides become a bit less vertical. Although this sagging isn’t obvi-
ous to non-koi people, it can drive koi purists nuts. For the second
go-round, many owners install liners over rigid concrete walls.
These second ponds are almost always bigger and (sigh) better.
Concrete ponds with a liner
Concrete ponds with liners have concrete block walls. The walls
and the pond’s bottom (which isn’t concrete) are covered by a
liner. These ponds combine the beneficial features of both liner
ponds and concrete ponds and fall somewhere in between in terms
of expense and difficulty of installation.
A good design now makes a 
difference down the road
As with most endeavors, building a koi pond properly from the
start is easier than fixing problems later on, so consider your
options carefully before beginning. Lay out several shapes with a
garden hose, and view them from all possible angles (including
your home’s windows) that may face the area.
Consider also the depth of your interests — if you know you’re a
fish fanatic, then you may as well build the largest pond within
your means. If you tend to lose interest in hobbies rapidly, then
a simple pond may be your best bet.
Before buying materials, consider such points as your soil and
your yard’s slope. Will rocks or roots limit your pond’s depth?
Does the slope favor one shape over another?
Why pond depth is important
Koi are big fish. They need to swim not only forward but also up
and down in varying depths of water. A pond that’s at least 4 feet
deep provides the vertical range of motion they need. The depth
also helps stymie potential predators, such as long-necked blue
herons and grabby raccoons.
A deeper pond also has a more stable temperature. It stays cooler
in summer and warmer in winter (this is important if you’re in
the northern latitudes and plan on heating your pond). A 6- to 
8-foot depth is the maximum that you — and your koi — will
ever need.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
84

Selecting the appropriate size
The wider the koi pond, the more koi you can put in it. However,
you need to consider practical upper and lower limits before you
decide on the size of your pond.
The smallest pond with enough space for growing koi (and they all
grow from 3 to 6 inches a year) is about 6 feet wide, 9 feet long, and
4 feet deep. A pond this size holds just over 1,600 gallons, which
just happens to be your target gallon figure. Note: Although you
can say your pond holds 1,600 gallons in discussions with other
people, koi-keepers modestly round the size of their ponds to the
nearest 500 gallons. So in conversations with other koi-keepers,
your pond holds 1,500 gallons.
How do you know how many gallons fit into any given pond?
Follow these calculations:
1. Determine the rough dimensions of your pond.
2. Multiply the length times the width times the depth.
3. Multiply that total number times 7.48 (the number of gal-
lons in a cubic foot of water).
For example, a pond with a water area of 8 feet x 7 feet x 4 feet is
224 cubic feet. When you multiply 224 by 7.48, you know the pond
can hold 1,675 gallons.
Be sure you fill the pond to the actual depth that you figured. Most
ponds have about 6 inches of freeboard (the distance between the
water’s surface and the top edge of the pond), so a 4-foot-deep
pond may only have 31⁄2 feet of water.
The shape of the pond affects the formula you use to figure the
number of gallons the pond holds. For example, a circular pond
uses the area of a circle (π × radius, squared) multiplied by the
depth, multiplied by 7.48. So, for a 4-foot-deep circular pond with
a 10-foot diameter, the formula is
Gallons = (3.14 × 5)2 × 4 × 7.48
= 246.49 × 4 × 7.48
= 7,374
Opting for a simple shape
Carefully consider the shape of your new pond. The KISS principle
(Keep It Simple, Sweetie) can help — not because of your pond’s
Chapter 6: Planning Your Koi Pond 85

feng shui but because of the water movement. The more convoluted,
dumbbell-like the shape, the less efficient the water circulation and
your filter will be. On a day to day basis, you can more easily deter-
mine whether your pond is chemically balanced when it has a
simple design.
For filtration efficiency, the simplest and most efficient pond shape
is round with a funnel-like bottom leading to the filter drain.
However, this isn’t very attractive. After your friends realize that
the pond resembles a simple funnel, you’ll never hear the end of
the jokes. Nevertheless, you can build a gorgeous, efficient koi
pond and still incorporate the design elements that make a round
pool so workable.
If you’re happy with plain-Jane aesthetics and ease of care, another
good shape is a simple rectangular or oblong pond. This shape is
easy to keep clean because
 It’s big enough to locate two filter drains along the midline.
 You can angle the water returns to nudge crud such as fish
waste and dead leaves to the center of the pond.
 The pond has no dead areas (poor water circulation) because
nothing stops the water from flowing.
Where to Dig Your Pond —
Location, Location, Location
If you decide to build a pond, place it where you can enjoy it the
most. Most people prefer a tranquil place in their backyard so they
can easily view it from a window or back porch. Other people take
pond visibility to heart and place their pond both indoors and out-
doors (see Chapter 10 for more info on this variation).
Keep in mind the following potential locations when determining
the perfect place for your pond:
 In the full sun: A pond in full sun is heaven for algae, so you
need to pay attention to the filtration system and the UV 
sterilizer. Your pond design should incorporate some rocky
overhangs or other shaded spots for the koi because they
need shade, too. A cloth- or vine-covered pergola over one
end can provide a respite for koi and koi watchers.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
86

 Under a tree: A pond beneath a tree is going to have pH and
leaf or pine-needle challenges. The leaves fall into the pond
and start to rot, causing the pH to become acidic. A good
pond skimmer that has a pump and filter media can catch
some of the leaves, but you still need to net leaves daily.
 Next to trees: Trees next to a pond present another problem.
Tree roots can tilt sidewalks, pierce pond liners, and crack a
cement pool. (Yes, you can patch liners and seal cracks in a
cement pond yourself; see Chapter 9.)
 Next to a house or garage: A pond that’s under the edge of
the roof overhang (where rain can fall into the pond) has a
dramatic spike in pH after a rainfall. You need to monitor the
pH. (You can buy an easy kit for this, or you can buy a pH pen.
See Chapter 9 for more on this tool.) Count on changing 10
percent of the water after a heavy rainstorm to keep the pH
where koi like it (about 6.8 to 7.7).
 Near your neighbor’s yard: If your neighbor raises prize-
winning roses and frequently uses spray insecticides and 
fertilizers, you may want to rethink placing your pond next
to her yard. Place your pond at least 4 feet from a property
line so it’s beyond the range of any incidental fertilizer or
insecticide spraying. You can also check the direction of the
prevailing wind (if there is one) and then locate your pond so
your neighbor is normally downwind.
Finding the Right 
Filtration System
Unless you have a natural stream flowing through your yard,
you need a good filtration system to keep koi alive and healthy.
Filtration isn’t just an aesthetic consideration — it’s also a necessity
for maintaining the water quality your fish need. The movement of
water returning to the pond from the filter also disturbs the water’s
surface, causing its oxygen content to rise. Fish in poorly oxy-
genated waters rapidly become stressed and die.
Koi are large, active fish that produce copious amounts of waste
and use up lots of oxygen. Ideally your pump and filter need to
process the total volume of the pond at least once every two
hours. Natural systems (ones that rely on plants for oxygen and
snails to recycle waste products) are doomed to failure unless you
maintain very small fish in very large ponds.
Chapter 6: Planning Your Koi Pond 87

This section looks more closely at the importance of a filtration
system in your koi pond and points out the critical elements of a
good system.
How a filtration system works
A filtration system for koi is mechanical (straining out the solid and
semisolid matter from the water) and biological (removing the dis-
solved ammonia and other chemicals that fish excrete). The system
works in tandem with the pond skimmer, which removes leaves and
pond scum. As the filtration system pulls water from the bottom of
the pond, the skimmer pulls water from the pond’s surface.
Pond filters are either above-ground units or gravity-fed units
below the surface of the pond.
 Above-ground filters: These filters (about the size of a
garbage can) are single or multiple units that sit directly on
the ground, adjacent to the pond. They’re fed by a water
pump that pulls water from the pond via a flexible rubber or
PVC pipe. (You’ll need to dig a trench from the pond’s external
drain pipes to the filter and construct a brick or stone-lined
pit in that trench for the water pump.)
Although the pumps for the above-ground filters are sub-
mersible and you can conceivably place them in the pond,
you don’t really want to do that. A pump outside of the pond
is infinitely easier to service or replace if a problem occurs.
 Gravity-fed filters: These pond filters must be lower than the
surface of the pond. Usually these filters are three separate
chambers in a brick- or concrete-block-lined pit that’s adjacent
to the pond. The water pump is located between the last
chamber and the pond, taking the clean water from the filter
and pushing it back into the pond. These pumps use less
power than pumps for the above-ground filters, so they’re
also more popular with koi owners.
Regardless of which filtration system you use, you can decide
where and how the water re-enters the pond. Some people direct
the water through a waterfall, through a shallow plant bog with
watercress or other plants that consume the nitrates, or through
directionalized outlets. (Bonus on the outlets: Some koi like swim-
ming against the currents that the outlets set up.)
The next two sections introduce the two basic types of filtration
systems.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
88

Standard filter system
This traditional filter system (see Figure 6-1) divides the mechani-
cal and biological filtration components. The filter may have either
two mechanical and two biological components, or three mechani-
cal and one biological component. The mechanical component
consists of two chambers:
 The settlement chamber pulls in pond water so solids and
semisolids can settle to the bottom.
 The second chamber pulls the first-stage clean water from
the top of the settlement chamber and strains smaller
solid pieces of waste via interlocked brushes or a series of
fiber mats.
In the third or fourth unit (a biological filter), convoluted plastic
balls or PVC turnings provide surface area for aerobic (friendly)
bacteria. These bacteria require an oxygen-rich environment,
which the movement of water over the plastic or PVC material pro-
vides. (Aerobic bacteria are a critical part of the filtration process
because they consume ammonia and nitrites in the water and con-
vert them to less toxic nitrates.)
The clean water that emerges from the biological filter goes
through the water pump and back into the pond.
Figure 6-1: A standard pond filter, with mechanical and biological filtration 
components.
Chapter 6: Planning Your Koi Pond 89

The bead filter
The bead filter combines both mechanical and biological functions
in a single, undivided unit (see Figure 6-2). This filter pulls water
into a chamber that’s half-filled with floating plastic media bits (or
beads) that provide surface area for the growth of friendly bacte-
ria. As the water travels through the beads, the solid and semisolid
materials are filtered out. At the same time, the bacteria convert
the ammonia and nitrite to nitrate. The clean water is then chan-
neled to the pump for return to the pond.
Figure 6-2: A bead filter.
Choosing the right features 
for your system
Your filter subsystem needs to be large enough to circulate and
clean the pond water at least once every two hours. A 1,500-gallon
pond needs a filter with a 750-gallon-per-hour (gph) capacity,
but you won’t be sorry if you buy one with a 1,500 gph capacity.
The more often the water is circulated through the filter, the cleaner

it is — both mechanically (more debris removed from the water)
and biologically (more chances for the beneficial bacteria to break
down nitrogenous wastes).
Larger filters are, of necessity, powered by stronger pumps, which
in turn cause greater turbulence as the water is returned to the
pool, allowing more oxygen to mix in with the water. This feature is
an important consideration for large, active fish — most especially
during the summer when the warm water holds less oxygen than
cold water does. Plan to install an appropriately large filtration
system when you set up your pond, even if the koi are small. If all
goes well, they’ll grow and may soon over-tax a small system.
When you’re comparing filters, check out the surface area of the
biofilter, the section that acts as home to the aerobic bacteria.
Because this component needs a lot of surface area to make the
water clean, you’ll find the better filters generally have more sur-
face area.
You can also purchase some add-ons to a basic filter system, all of
which make your koi more comfortable and ease your work and
worry load. Some extras include the following:
 UV sterilizer: This add-on between the filter/water pump and
the outflow pipes is a self-contained unit that uses UV light to
kill single-celled organisms like algae and protozoans in the
water. (The filter can’t get these because they’re too small.)
Eliminating these plant forms avoids the pea-soup syndrome.
 Pond heater: For ponds in northern climes, consider adding a
pond heater. Koi can overwinter in northern areas like Detroit,
but their survival factor goes way down if your pond isn’t
deep enough or if the weather warms and then takes another
nose dive. Unless you heat your pond, expect to lose a few koi
at the end of every cold season. A gas- or electricity-powered
heater is plumbed between the filter and the pond.
Don’t spend your money on an all-in-one pump and filter that sits
on the floor of the pond and plugs into a nearby electrical outlet.
These units may be okay for a garden pond, but they’re awful for
koi because
 They don’t have much cleaning capacity.
 The filter material quickly clogs.
 You have to remove them from the pond and disassemble
them in order to clean them.
 Hoisting the water-and-sludge-filled filter out of the pond and
then hosing off the components is a wet and messy chore.
 A submerged electrical pump is a short waiting to happen.
Chapter 6: Planning Your Koi Pond 91

The cost factor: What does 
a pump cost to run?
When figuring out which filtration system to purchase, you also
want to consider the cost of running the system. And because the
pump needs to run all year, your costs also run 24/7/365.
To figure the cost to run a pump, follow these steps:
1. Note the number of watts the pump uses.
For example, a pump can use 350 watts per hour.
2. Divide the watts by 1,000 to determine the kilowatts.
For this example, divide 350 by 1,000 to get 0.35 kilowatts
per hour.
3. Take the number of hours in a year (365 days times
24 hours) to figure out how many kilowatts your pump
uses in a year.
For this example, 0.35 × 8,760 hours = 3,066 kilowatt hours.
4. Take what you pay for a kilowatt.
Check on your energy bill. If you can’t find the info, call
your electric or gas company. In 2005, the national average
was 9.44 cents per kilowatt per hour.
5. Multiply the cost of kilowatts per hour by the number of
kilowatt hours your pump uses per year to find the true
cost to run your pump.
For this example, you pay 9.5 cents × 3,066 or $291.27 per
year to run the pump.

f you want to build a koi pond in your yard, you have many 
decisions to make. The first and foremost decision: Are you
going to build this pond yourself or hire a professional to do it for
you? If you’re considering hiring a contractor to do the dirty work,
you want to make sure you find one who knows his stuff (more on
that later in this chapter).
After you decide on the builder, you need to figure out which type
of pond you want to build because the type of pond greatly affects
the types of building materials you choose. But where to start?
(If you haven’t read Chapter 6, you may want to check it out now
to get the big picture on planning.)
Don’t worry. Take your time and try to enjoy the process. This chap-
ter reviews some of the more common construction methods and
gives you the good and bad points of each type. We also walk you
through the three different types of pond constructions: with a
liner, with a liner and concrete-block walls, or simply with concrete
blocks.
This chapter also tells you how to complete the pond with a filter
system, lighting, skimmers, and other components. Finally, we help
you avoid problems as your new pond settles in. 

Who Will Dig (And Build) 
Your Pond?
Building a pond isn’t a decision to be taken lightly. Your first major
step is to make the all-important decision of whether to build the
pond yourself or hire a professional contractor.
If this is your first koi pond, discuss your plans with other koi
fanciers before you turn a single shovelful of dirt or call a single
contractor. This move will save you a lot of grief. Other koi keepers
are very willing to share their been there, done that experiences. 
This section covers the pros and cons of building the pond your-
self compared to hiring a professional. If you do decide to hire a
professional, this section helps you ask the right questions.
Doing it yourself
If you have the skills, you can certainly dig and build your own pond.
You may need a few friends to help because it’s definitely hard work. 
Knowing what you’re getting yourself into
Digging and building your own pond is physically hard work.
You have to deal with many issues and situations, including:
 Lifting the (heavy) dirt: One of the first problems is how to lift
the dirt out of the future pond area without crushing one of
the dirt sides. If you do decide to go this route, you can create
a ledge to help keep the sides from crushing — see Figure 7-1.
 Removing the dirt: After you dig the dirt from the pond, what
are you going to do with it? You’ll have way too much to scat-
ter into your lawn or dump into raised flower beds; you’d have
the only 7-foot chrysanthemum bed in town!
You may be able to run a classified ad offering free dirt and
find someone who can use it. As a last resort, you can haul off
the dirt and dump it in a landfill — for a fee.
 Digging trenches for the filter pipes and (maybe) a site for
the filter: You’ll need to dig trenches for the filter pipes, and a
pit for the pump (for an above-ground filtration system) or
a larger pit to contain the filter and pump (for a gravity-fed
system). All of the pits will need to be brick or cement block
lined, to avoid cave-ins and for access.
 Walling in the pond: You can use a liner, or go for the more
solid approach of concrete blocks.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
94

 Finishing the pond edge: You’ll be adding capstones or a
raised lip at the edge of the pond.
 Installing and hooking up the filter system: This is where the
rubber will meet the road for the success of your pond.
At this point we can understand if the idea of building your own
pond is beginning to sound less like fun and more like work.
Figure 7-1: Creating a step while digging to avoid crushing the pond’s sides.
Hiring workers to help with the dirty work
Hiring out the digging may help. You can hire someone with a back-
hoe and include dirt disposal as part of the deal. That part of the
task is then done, quite likely in less time than it would have taken
you and three of your best friends — or ex-best friends.
Even if you do take on the actual construction of your pond, you
may want to hire out parts of the job. This includes a fiberglass
installer or a pump service that gets your ready-mix concrete into
your backyard, or a masseur who makes house calls.
Hiring a professional 
for the entire project
You may decide to hire a koi pond construction firm to handle the
entire project. With this arrangement, you’re involved in the site
selection and pond design. The contractor does the rest. The cost
of your pond increases with the more experts you bring onboard.
But money well spent at this point can save you dollars and huge
headaches down the road. Remember, you only have to do it right
once . . . until you want a larger pond.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 95

Finding a reputable contractor
If you decide to hire out the construction of the entire pond, make
sure you find a reputable contractor. Ask the following people for
advice:
 Your koi friends: Ask them about contractors they can recom-
mend and about construction issues that have come up in
their own pond projects.
 Folks you find in the phone book or online: Set up your own
query system. Look in the yellow pages of your phone book.
Go online and type in pond contractors and your zip code.
Ask your friends and neighbors if they know of any pond con-
tractors, or if they know of someone who might know of a 
contractor.
Asking the right questions
To find out whether a contractor is the right one, start with the
right questions. You can discover a lot about the prospective 
contractors with these questions:
 How many koi ponds have you built? Ask specifically about
past projects. Individuals who build garden ponds or swimming
pools may not know how a koi pond is different, and you need
to find this out. A koi pond requires a different drainage system,
filtration system, and pump than a garden pond or a swim-
ming pool (check out Chapter 6 for more information on these
essentials). A builder who assures you that “3 feet is plenty
deep enough” is not going to be the builder of your dreams.
 How many years have you been building koi ponds? If he
hesitates and does that sideways-shift-of-the-eyes thing, brace
yourself. This guy knows koi ponds like you know early
Sanskrit.
 Are you comfortable telling me about problems you’ve had
in building koi ponds? An honest construction person, one
who is comfortable with his (or her) own abilities may start
to laugh at this question, and then proceed to tell you about
the huge rocks in the excavation site, the early snowfall/
enormous rainstorm, or the middle-of-the-project design
changes. Understand that unavoidable/unforeseen problems
will increase the cost of a pond, so keep some money avail-
able for these problems. 
 Can you provide references from previous koi pond proj-
ects? Make sure you check these references! Talk to people
whose ponds were built by each contractor and go look at
the ponds. Ask about problems with pea soup syndrome or
other water-quality issues (see Chapter 9 for more on these
questions). 
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
96

Closing the deal
After you’ve chosen one particular contractor, make sure you final-
ize all the details before you sign the contract. Yes, these are points
that the builder and potential pond owner need to agree will be
factored into the design. 
They include: 
 The koi pond must have at least one bottom drain for every
16 square feet of bottom area, and the floor of the pond
must be tilted down toward the drains. The tilt ensures 
detritus that falls to the floor of the pond will be channeled
towards the drains and into the filtration system.
 The pond must not have a gravel, rock, or sand flooring.
It must have solid, smooth flooring, so there’s no spaces for
anaerobic bacteria to hide, and so the suction from the filter
can pull waste into the drains.
 The pond must have vertical walls with a minimum depth of
4 feet, so the koi can escape predators and for better water
temperature control.
 An external pump is the only sane choice. Pumps stop work-
ing, and no one relishes the idea of jumping into a koi pond,
grabbing a nonworking pump, and lifting it out of the pond
(you did turn off the electricity before you jumped in, didn’t
you?). Pumps last maybe three years, and the financial side of
replacing them is painful enough.
You may want to add a clause that holds back the final 10 percent
until the pond is operating according to mutually agreed-upon
guidelines.
Converting a Swimming Pool 
into a Koi Pond
If you already own a swimming pool and find you aren’t using it
much these days, you may be glad to know you can easily revamp
it, for not a whole lot of money, into a terrific koi pond. This is the
route lots of koi-keepers tend to take.
In order to convert your swimming pool into a koi pond, you need
to take the following steps, more or less in the order given:
1. Drain the pool and remove the ladders.
Use waterproof patching putty to fill the holes left by the
screws.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 97

2. Round all corners in the pool.
Doing so prevents dead areas of no water circulation and
prevents detritus from lining the bottom perimeter of the
pond. To round the corners:
• Add a baffle at a 45-degree angle at each vertical
corner.
You can use bricks, stacking them on top of each
other (see Figure 7-2a). You can also use 1-x-12 boards
laid upright against the corners and secured in place
with those big blue cement screws (see Figure 7-2b).
Waterproof the boards with a thin layer of cement.
• Add a smaller 45-degree baffle (made from cement)
between the bottom perimeter of the pool and the
sides.
3. Change the filtration system and install larger drainpipes.
A swimming-pool filter is a high head (meaning high pres-
sure and strong pump), low volume system. A swimming-
pool filter can take eight hours to circulate the entire pool,
which tells you something about the water quality in the
average swimming pool. A good koi-pond filter should cir-
culate the pond capacity every two hours. 
Figure 7-2: Rounding the corners of a pool.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
98

4. Change out the drainpipes for 4-inch-diameter pipes.
You’ll also want to change out the drain units for domed
drains that can incorporate aeration.
Changing the drainpipes means literally chipping in a new
trench for each drain, through the bottom of the pond, in a
line from the filter to the drain. There’s no sense in remov-
ing the old drainpipes — they may be sealed in place by
cement. Place the new PVC pipes into the new trenches.
Dig a trench on the outside of the pond, next to the wall, so
you can connect the plumbing to the filter on the far end.
5. Add a raised lip to the edge of the pool to avoid ground-
water intrusion. This includes any kind of runoff water., no
matter what the source. (See Figure 7-3 for an illustration of
the components of a raised lip.)
6. Paint the pool a dark color with an epoxy-like pool liner.
You want to paint your empty pool for two reasons: You want
people to notice your new koi pond and not say, “Oh, you’ve
put fish (pause) in your swimming pool (with lowered 
eyebrows and a sideways glance from narrowed eyes).”
Also, you need to seal the cement (and umpteen years of
chemicals) away from your fish.
Figure 7-3: A raised lip.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 99

Buy a paint-on or spray-on epoxy paint that’s made just for
this purpose. You want a product that seals off the cement
and has a bit of flexibility so it can serve as a liner, prevent-
ing tiny tile and cement cracks from becoming a problem.
This is pretty much a specialized product, meaning you will
not find it at a paint store or at a home improvement store.
Go online and type epoxy pond liner and sealer — one
brand is called Pond Armor.
Selecting the Building Materials
for Your Spanking New Pond
A basic koi pond must be at least 4 feet deep and about 6 feet wide x
9 feet long to afford the minimum swimming area for your growing
koi. This size pond holds just over 1,500 gallons (and this is consid-
ered a small pond!). Experienced koi experts say a 3,000-gallon pond
is as easy to keep as a 1,500-gallon one, but a smaller pond is a lot
less intimidating for a beginner. It’s also less expensive to build.
Whether you’re building a liner-alone pond, a concrete pond, or a
concrete and liner pond (check out Chapter 6 for more general info
on these three types of ponds), ensure that it’s appropriate for
your new koi by choosing the right building materials.
First, keep in mind the following general points regarding materi-
als, no matter what type of pond you choose:
 The materials used for the pond must be watertight and non-
toxic to fish.
 The materials must be long lasting; liners are guaranteed for
20 years, and concrete ponds, like diamonds, are forever.
 The surface of the pond needs to be even and smooth, so
detritus and bacteria can’t find a refuge.
To get started, noted that all three pond types need the following
general materials:
 Large-enough diameter drains and PVC pipes, which bring the
water from the pond into the filter.
 A filter outflow, which takes the filtered water back into
the pond.
 A filter and pump, connected inline to the drainpipes and the
filter outflow in the pond (depending on the type of filter, the
pump is between the filter and the pond or between the filter
and the outflow).
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
100

The following supplies are specific to a liner-alone pond:
 You’ll need a liner, one large enough to line the entire pond
with at least an 18-inch overlap at ground level.
 The pond dimensions will stay more constant if the liner is, in
effect, suspended from a concrete collar or ring at ground
level. The collar will take concrete and rebar.
 You’ll need bulkheads for each drain, light, and skimmer that
goes through the liner. These bulkheads seal the openings, so
no water can ooze through the openings. Water under pressure
can be pretty sneaky, working its way into areas you thought
would be no problem at all, so a bulkhead is a must for any
opening.
You need the following materials for a concrete/cement block pond:
 Enough concrete for the floor, and enough concrete or con-
crete and cement blocks for the walls
 Rebar for the flooring and walls, to strengthen the concrete
The following supplies are specific to a concrete and liner pond:
 Concrete and rebar for the collar, walls, and floor
 A liner large enough to line the pond and for an 18-inch rim
once the liner is in place
Going with a Liner-Alone Pond
Several types of liners are available in the marketplace, and even
the best liners are inexpensive. Look for a liner that is 45 or 60 mils
thick. For a small 9-x-6-x-4-foot koi pond, a 45-mil liner costs about
$170; a 60-mil liner costs about $285 (“mil,” in this case, means
thousandths of an inch).
Liners alone work for small ponds 4 feet deep x 6 feet x 9 feet
(which is our suggested minimum). The deeper the pond excava-
tion, the greater the chance that the sides will collapse inwards of
their own volition as the pond is dug or as the pond fills with water.
Starting with a pond wall ring
You can reduce the chance of a wall collapse and still use a liner
for a bigger pond by installing a pond wall ring — also called a
pond collar — before you begin digging the pond itself. The pond
wall ring is a solid concrete footer (a concrete base that will 
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 101

support a larger heavier structure above it or hanging from it) at
the top edge of the pond. The liner is suspended from this ring.
To put in a pond wall ring, take the following steps:
1. Stake out the shape and dimensions of your pond.
2. Dig a trench about a foot wide and 10 inches deep at the
outside edge of your soon-to-be pond, all the way around
your pond.
The actual dimensions of the ring depend on the type of soil
you have. (Sand and heavy clay soils require a wider and
deeper ring, up to 15 inches wide and 10 inches deep, with
rebar added.) This trench becomes your pond wall ring.
3. Line the pond-side of the trench with 1 x 8s or with 8-
inch-wide strips of oiled plywood.
Take care to stake the wood so the interior edge of the ring
will stay vertical when you pour concrete into the trench.
4. Add wire braces and rebar to the pond ring trench, with
at least two (and preferably three) lengths of rebar
throughout the trench.
The rebar sits atop the wire braces and ends up in the
center of the poured concrete.
5. Pour or pump the concrete into the pond ring to a depth
of 6 inches (10 inches for clay soils, which are notori-
ously slippery).
Figuring out how much concrete you need isn’t difficult.
A yard of concrete contains 9 cubic feet. Each linear foot of
your 12-inch-wide, 6-inch-deep trench takes 1⁄2 cubic foot 
(6 x 12 x 12 inches), so 18 feet of trench requires 1 cubic
yard of concrete. 
6. Wait about half an hour and use a float (a rectangular
trowel, used as a smoothing device) to smooth the top 
surface.
Use an edging tool to round the pond-side edge of the con-
crete so the edge won’t cut or pierce the liner when you
install it and pull it up over the edge of the pond ring.
7. Tamp the poured concrete to collapse any air pockets.
Let it set up for 24 to 36 hours before removing the wood.
Let the concrete cure for another 36 hours.
At this point, the pond wall ring is about 4 inches below ground
surface. Later you’ll secure the liner’s top edge to this ring and then
mortar bricks or concrete blocks on top to create the pond edge.

102

Excavating and adding the drains
After the pond ring has hardened, you can begin the real fun — 
digging. You can dig by hand or with a small backhoe. 
Drains may seem like a pain to install, but they are a vital part of
the system of keeping your pond clean. A good drainage system,
coupled with a good filter, means your pond will stay clean with
comparatively little work on your part.
Digging trenches for the drainpipes and the drains themselves only
has to be done once, if you do it right — when else can you get
such a payoff?
After you remove the dirt from the pond drain trenches, take the
following steps:
1. Use a round-tipped shovel to round all corners in the
pond (at the sides and at the bottom).
Use the rounded tip of the shovel to scrape the corners
round and remove the scrapings. Rounding the corners
makes it easier for the filter returns to set up a circular cur-
rent in the pond. This helps keep the pond clean., and it
also provides a current for the fish to swim against, a bit
like those narrow swimming pools that have a strong cur-
rent to make swimming more work.
2. Build a wooden bridge across the width of the pond and
extend it about 3 feet beyond the edge of the pond at
both ends.
This bridge becomes your safe access to the pond,
enabling you to place the drains and the filter return — and
remove any extra dirt — without clambering in and out
over the edge.
3. Place the bottom drains.
Center the drain(s) along the long measurement of your
pond, each with a 4-foot radius. The filter system in a koi
pond is designed to pull detritus in from a 4-foot circle
around each drain. That’s why you locate the drains at 
8-foot intervals.
4. Once the filters and drains, are in place, add dirt to the
floor, starting at the perimeter and working towards the
drains.
Your goal is to slant the bottom of the pond towards the
drains 2 to 6 inches per foot.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 103

5. Add the filter outflow, the pipes that will take clean
water from the filter back into the pond.
Filter outflows can be positioned in several ways. You can
send all or part of it through a bog pond next to the koi
pond and let it drip from the bog pond into the koi pond.
You’ll need a big bog pond to effectively treat 750 gallons
an hour, or whatever your hourly pump flow might be.
To send only part of the filter outflow through a bog pond,
use a Y-shaped PVC joint in the filter outflow, and send half
to the bog and the other half directly into the pond or into
a waterfall that feeds the pond.
To use the full force of the filter outflow to create current
in your koi pond, dig carefully under the pond collar and
bring the filter outflow into the pond in a corner, right
through the 45-degree baffle you put in place (you’ll seal
around the pipe with Silastic, or you can buy one-piece out-
flow pipes that are cast with the mounting plate in place).
You can add joints in the PVC piping to create one high and
one low outflow.
For a large pond, you can set up two filters, each handling
two or more drains and returning the water to the pond via
corner outflows as described above, but in opposite cor-
ners and directed in opposite directions.
Make sure you dig carefully. With a liner, the fewer bulkheads
through the liner, the fewer leaks now and in the future.
Inserting the liner
If you’ve read the preceeding sections and followed the steps,
you’ve dug your hole, removed most of the dirt, added your drains,
and slanted the bottom of your pond. Now you need to insert the
liner. Take these steps:
1. Add a cushion to the bottom of your pond to prevent tree
roots from puncturing the liner.
A liner doesn’t have much give when it’s held against the
earth by 1,500 gallons of water. (That’s almost 12,500
pounds!) You need to provident some kind of shield to 
protect the liner. Install a liner underlayment that’s made
for this purpose. Cost is about $2.25 a square yard.
2. Trim the underlayment around the drains. As you place
the underlayment, take care not to step on or trip over the
drains. Cut an X over each drain so you can push the under-
layment down over the drain; then trim the points off or
tuck them under.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
104

3. Unfold the liner and slide it over the pond opening.
Allow the liner to drape down into the pond.
4. Hold the liner so it sags into the pond, but adjust its posi-
tion so it overlaps the pond on all four sides by about
18 inches.
Let the liner flow down into the pond and keep the edges of
the liner out of the pond. You generally need three or four
people to help with this step because the liner is big and
heavy. You want to stay back from the edge of the pond
because you don’t want to break the edge of the collar or
crumble the side of the pond.
5. After the liner is lowered into the center of the pond,
select one person to get into the pond to arrange the
liner as it moves down.
This person flattens the folds so the liner lies as flat as pos-
sible, while the people above him or her pull and loosen
the liner as directed.
6. The person in the pond is the one who will pull the liner
taut over the bottom drains and cut the lining for the
bulkhead installation over the drains.
Start with a simple “X” in the center of the drain, for posi-
tioning of the bulkhead, and then trim off the corners to
create a permanent opening in the liner. Screw the bulk-
head in place, making certain that the liner is between the
two components all the way around the drain. Many people
add a rim of sealant such as Silastic before they attach the
bulkhead to the drain.
After you’ve cut and installed the liner around the bottom
drains, only minor shifting is now possible. This is where
you’ll tidy the folds in the corners of the pond, and stretch
the liner out over the edge of the pond opening.
7. Once the liner has been linked to the bottom drains, you
can begin adding water to the pond, continuing to adjust
folds of the liner to create as few deep folds as possible.
Deeper folds become havens for anaerobic bacteria, so go
for shallow pleats rather than deep folds.
8. You can install a skimmer at the surface of the water.
Skimmers can be protein skimmers, to take in and filter out
surface foam, or they can be surface skimmers, that take in
leaves and other solid-surface debris. Either one replaces
what you’d do with a long-handled skimmer; the protein
skimmer is specifically designed to dispose of surface foam.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 105

Where and how the skimmer is fastened to the pond wall
depends on the design of the skimmer. Surface skimmers
need to be mounted so the water level hits at the middle of
the intake; protein skimmers need to be mounted so the
opening is at water level. In either case, with a pond liner, a
rigid backing needs to be in place behind the liner so the
skimmer can be fastened via a bulkhead to the brace
behind the liner.
9. Pull the liner up over the edge of the pond ring. Using
washers and masonry screws, pin the liner in place atop
the pond ring.
10. Add brick or concrete blocks to the upper edge of the
pond, atop the pond ring and liner.
The top layer of bricks or blocks is called the capstone,
and its upper edge should be at least 6 inches above
ground level to keep rainwater runoff out of your pond.
Creating a Pond with a Liner 
and Concrete-Block Walls
For many koi fanciers, the pool of choice has a pond liner that’s
propped up by rigid, concrete-block walls. This version combines
some of the economies of the pond liner with the do-it-once-and-
forget-it appeal of concrete block. It also permits you to build a
sizeable pond for not a lot of money.
Shoveling dirt: Dig time
You begin this pond by digging. Depending on how much work you
want to do, you can dig the pond yourself (a lot of work) or with
some strong friends (less work, a lot more fun), or you can hire
a backhoe operator with a small backhoe. If you want to dig the
pond yourself, follow these steps:
1. Lay out a garden hose on the ground to create your
roughly oval or roughly rectangular pond shape or
stake out your pond shape and size.
You’ll build your pond inside these lines.
2. Start digging.
Create a ramp at one end of the pond so you can remove
the dirt via a wheelbarrow (you’ll need to fill in and tamp
down that end of the pond when you finish the excavation),
or let the backhoe do the labor.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
106

3. After the pond has been excavated, the first concrete work
will be for a footer that will underlie the walls of the pond.
This is much like the pond ring used for the liner-alone
pond, but this time, it will be at the bottom of an excava-
tion, not next to it. The footer is poured into a trench
around the perimeter down inside the pond. Stakes, string,
and a level can help you dig an even trench.
The footer’s depth and width depends on your soil type.
The footer must bear the weight of the walls and the pres-
sure of the water. At a minimum, the footer needs to be
12 inches wide and about 8 inches deep. Your concrete sup-
plier can tell you what sort of soil you have in your area
and may suggest the dimensions of your footer.
4. Add wire braces every 2 feet or so along the footer trench.
5. Place the rebar atop the wire braces, so when the concrete
is poured, the rebar will be in the center of the concrete.
Place at least two lengths of rebar and preferably three
throughout the trench. The rebar gives extra strength to
the footer.
6. Buy ready-mixed concrete; when the truck delivers it,
wheelbarrow it from the street to your pond site.
Your cost will be about $100 per cubic yard. You can also
mix the concrete yourself, using a small concrete mixer.
These rent for about $100 a day.
7. Pour the concrete into the footer at the bottom of the
pond excavation, and move it into the far reaches of the
footer with a concrete hoe. Use a float to smooth the con-
crete and a 2-foot level to make certain the top surface of
the footer is essentially level.
Having a level footer makes it easier to place level layers of
concrete block. After you’ve troweled or floated the upper
surface smooth, you’re done — for 24 hours.
8. Allow the concrete to cure for one day.
Laying the block walls
Even if you’ve never laid block before, you can lay your own con-
crete block (as long as you keep your pond size modest). Just
remember two important caveats about using concrete:
 It’s hard work. The blocks weigh 40 pounds each. You may
not want to do this by yourself — sharing the workload is a
good idea.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 107

 It’s not cheap. The blocks can be expensive. And even though
laying your own concrete block is less expensive than hiring a
pro, you don’t want to make any costly mistakes. If you hire a
professional(s) to lay the block and the walls come out wavy,
you’re not the one who has to fix it. (And yes, knocking apart
concrete blocks is harder than concreting them together.)
After you let the footer cure for a day (see the previous section),
you’re ready to start laying the wall. Stick to these steps:
1. Use stakes and string to keep your blocks straight.
2. Lay the first layer of block on their sides, with the block
openings facing into the pond.
Your filter intake pipes will thread through these openings
without any extra work on your part.
3. Locate the filter as close as possible to the drain locations.
In koi-pond plumbing, the shortest, straightest plumbed
path is always the most beautiful.
4. Use your level to keep the block rows even as you build
the walls, tamping the blocks with the heel of your hand
or the end of your trowel to settle each into alignment.
5. Lock the corners of the pond with alternating blocks
from each side, just as you’ve seen concrete-block
houses built.
6. Round the corners with bricks or wooden brace (See
Figure 7-2).
7. To increase the strength of the walls, insert rebar down
into the walls as the layers of concrete block build up.
Then pump concrete down into the walls to create a solid
concrete wall.
8. Keep laying the block until the upper edge is about
3 inches above ground level. Stop here; you won’t lay
more block until the plumbing and liner are in place.
After the plumbing and the liner are in place, you’ll finish the cement
work on your pond. For ponds that are almost at ground level,
you’ll add a layer of capstones — flat cement blocks or cement
bricks without openings atop the final level of cement blocks —
and pull the liner over this solid layer. You’ll use washers and
cement screws to hold the liner in place toward the outside edge
of this stone layer. Then you’ll add another layer of capstone, con-
cealing the liner between the layers.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
108

For ponds that are built up from the ground’s surface, perhaps to
create a seating edge along the entire perimeter of the pond, or if
there are restrictions on how deep a pond can be dug, be certain
that your liner will be large enough to reach from the bottom of the
pond, up the walls of the pond, to the far edge of the first layer of
capstones.
You may need to shore up the walls within the pond pit temporar-
ily with plywood sheets braced with 2 x 4s pounded into the dirt
on the floor of the pond for a day or so until the concrete sets.
Aligning the drains
Once the footer and the walls are in place, you’re ready to add the
bottom drains, but before you begin this phase, you’ll be working
outside of the pond, installing the plumbing for the filter.
1. Dig a trench from the pond edge (at the approximate
location of each drain) to the filter installation point.
Complete this step a day or two after you lay the bricks,
just before you remove the wall braces.
2. Run a length of 3- or 4-inch PVC pipe along each trench.
These pipes will pull water from each drain to the filter.
3. Backfill the walls of the trench with gravel or sand from
the excavation, tamping it into place as you add it.
You may need to buy gravel or a load of sand if your soil is
clay; clay soils can’t be used for backfill because they’re
inherently slippery.
4. Place the filter drains in the pond floor, equidistant from
each other and the sides of the pond and near the exter-
nal drainpipes you just added.
Four- or six-inch drains work well. Because the filter drain
units are about a foot high, you’ll have to dig down into the
dirt floor of the pond to bury the lower 6 inches of the
drain unit. Add drain pipes between the drains and the
nearest external drainpipe.
5. As soon as the drainpipes are hooked up, add dirt to the
pond bottom until you have a slanted floor, slanting
down to the drains at a rate of 2 to 6 inches per foot.
When you’ve completed this step, only the round drain unit
top will be exposed.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 109

Adding the liner
Now you’re ready to add the liner underlayment, the liner. You’ll
secure the liner with cement screws and washers and add another
layer of capstones . The steps are the same as in a liner-alone pool.
Check out “Inserting the liner” earlier in this chapter for the basics
about these steps.
The all-concrete-block pond
The all-concrete-block pond uses the same steps as the pond liner
with concrete-block walls with two exceptions:
 The bottom of this pond is poured concrete.
 The liner is replaced by a paint-on or spray-on coating that
seals the block and mortar.
It’s possible to build the components of this pond in different
orders. The design we describe starts with the hole in the ground
and then adds the footer for the walls, the filter outflows, the walls,
the bottom drains, and finally the concrete bottom. Other designs
will start with a pond excavation, but then will add a poured-concrete
bottom then add the walls, install the bottom drains, and finally
add a second layer of concrete on the pond bottom.
Base your design in part on
 Your type of soil
 The height of your water table
 How much of your pond will extend above the surface of the
ground
Discuss these variables with other individuals who have built koi
ponds in your area, a professional pond builder, or even a struc-
tural engineer. Note: Altering plans before you begin to build is
really dirt cheap.
To build an all-concrete pond, follow the steps for the liner-with-
concrete-block-walls pond (check out “Creating a Pond with a Liner
and Concrete-Block Walls” earlier in this chapter) until the walls
are installed and you’re ready to place the drains. When you reach
that point, follow these steps:
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
110

1. Rake the dirt on the bottom until you have the 2- to 6-
inch per foot slant toward the center of the pond; then
place the drains along the central depression.
2. Bury each drain until only 6 inches is above ground level;
add a trench from the base of the drain to the nearest
external drainpipe.
3. Cut a length of 3- or 4-inch PVC pipe to fit between each
drain and its corresponding external drainpipe; then
place the pipes in the trenches.
4. Connect the pipes with the drain on one end and the
external drainpipe on the other.
5. Fill the trenches with dirt, add the wire braces and rebar
at regular intervals along the pond floor, and order the
concrete for the pond floor.
This last step doesn’t take a great deal of concrete; 
a 6-inch-thick floor for a 6-x-9-foot pond only takes 
1 cubic yard.
6. Space out the concrete on the pond floor as you dump
each bucket.
This timesaver places the concrete in an almost even layer,
thereby minimizing your effort to spread the concrete
across the pond floor.
7. Run a bevel between the sides and the pond floor as you
trowel the concrete into place on the pond floor, to elimi-
nate the usual 90-degree angle between floor and walls,
where debris will collect.
8. Let the concrete floor cure for a day before you walk
on it.
9. Once the concrete has cured for a day or two, you’ll need
to seal it, just as you’d seal the concrete walls of a con-
verted swimming pool. (Concrete is extremely alkaline,
and it will affect your water chemistry for years unless
you seal it.)
These sealers are not products you can buy at a home improvement
stores. They are nontoxic epoxy coatings that you spray, brush or
roll on. They are most easily purchased online. The manufacturer
may list retail outlets that sell the product, but you have to go
online to find the name of the retailer.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 111

Identifying (And Adding) Other
Construction Components
Now that you have the pond shell, what’s next? You need to
install a filter, but is there anything else you really ought to 
consider? But of course — and Figure 7-4 gives you a quick
preview of some of the various components, which we explain in
this section.
Figure 7-4: A schematic of a completed outdoor pond.
Installing the filtration unit
Chapter 6 discusses the two main options you have when adding
a filtration unit to your pond. If you decide to go with an above-
ground filter, you need a second trench for the filter outflow.
The outflow pipe can be plumbed to
 A small waterfall that trickles into the pond
 A bog garden that empties into the pond
 Returns that you install in the pond corners
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
112

If you go with a gravity-fed filter, you need one trench for the PVC
pipe that connects the external drainpipes to the first filter unit
and another trench for the outflow pipe from the water pump.
Like the above-ground filters, the water from the outflow can enter
the pond through a waterfall, a bog garden, or outflow pipes in the
pond corners.
Pick a site for your gravity-fed filters adjacent to the pond but not
in your line of vision of the pond. Granted, the pond filter area is
covered, but when you place it on one side or the other, you’re not
forced to look at it every time you look at the pond.
Whether you have an above-ground filter or a gravity-fed filter, we
offer these guidelines:
 For obvious reasons, be sure you buy a water pump or
water pumps powerful enough to do the task. Your pump(s)
should have an hourly rate equal to half the capacity of
your pond.
 Use sweep bends in the PVC pipes rather than right-angle
turns to reduce what an aerodynamicist would call the 
coefficient of drag. You don’t want to slow down the speed
of the water in the pipes, for either type of filter.
For the gravity-fed filter with the pump after the filter, you’re
paying big bucks for water ejected from the pump at a com-
paratively high rate of speed. You want to use this speed to
set up a current in your pond for your koi to swim against. 
For the above-ground filters, with the pump before the filter,
the water flow rate is slower. You don’t want to slow it down
any more. Even at these slower flow rates, you do not want to
create a back flow that will push against the flow of water
going through the filter.
Adding lighting
The vast majority of koi ponds do not have underwater lighting.
The owners feel that artificial lighting intrudes on the koi, who
cannot escape the light. And the fewer electrical components that
can go wrong in a pond, the better.
But if you like watching your koi swim at night, add-on lights are
self-contained lights that are easily installed in any pond.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 113

Skimmer units, protein and otherwise
The skimmer is a small surface-mounted filter system that slurps in
and filters water at the pond’s surface. Skimmers are useful for
removing newly fallen leaves, and they’re especially helpful if a
tree overhangs your pond. Specialized skimmers that remove dis-
solved organic compounds along with pond surface debris are
called protein skimmers or foam fractionators.
Protein skimmers are useful in koi ponds because koi are big fish
that cheerfully and freely produce copious quantities of fish slime,
milt, and other organic compounds. Some of this debris is dis-
solved in the water in the pond. Like the IRS, you can’t see it but
you know it’s always there. These floating dissolved organic com-
pounds (DOCs) are positively charged at one end and negatively
charged at the other. They appear on the pond’s surface as a thin
patch of scum or as persistent water bubbles. The protein skimmer
hooks onto these compounds by pulling water at the pond’s sur-
face across a bubble veil. The scum and bubbles coalesce and are
swept into the collection basket, along with other floating debris.
Place your skimmer where a prevailing wind can help push surface
detritus into the unit. If the skimmer is going to be plumbed into
the pump, dig a trench leading to the pump using PVC piping to
attach the two. Note: Skimmers may be powered by their own
pump, or they may be plumbed into the main water pump. 
(For the latter, install a dual valve manifold in the pump intake.)
Turn off your skimmer when you feed your koi — or the skimmer
may end up with the majority of the pellets.
Finishing work
The hard part about finishing work is that you’re so near yet so far.
These details are critical to the success of your pond, so keep on
pluggin’ away.
Heating
If you decide to heat your pond during the winter, the heater will be
 Plumbed to the water line exiting the pump for gravity-fed filters
 Plumbed to the water line exiting the filter for above-ground
filters.
A pond heater uses propane or electricity to heat a small boiler,
just like your own hot water heater. Water passes through the
boiler, is heated, and goes back into your pond.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
114

But before we get into a discussion about the finer points of heating
your pond, how do you know if you need a heater? Ponds in areas
where the nighttime temperatures routinely dip below 60 degrees F
need a heater. Pond temps that go below the mid 60s are an open
invitation for an Aeromonas outbreak. Aeromonas is, as you see in
Chapter 12, called “hole-in-side disease.”
How much it costs to heat your pond depends on several factors:
 Your pond size. A large pond works to your advantage when
you heat it up; the larger the body of water, the more heat it
retains.
 Your pond shape. A deeper pond holds heat better than a
shallow pond.
 Your pond construction. A concrete-block pond holds heat
better than a liner pond.
 Your pond orientation and exposure to the sun. Sun heats
things up, and even winter’s weaker sun is a lot warmer than
shade at that time of year. A pond in full sun stays warmer
than a shaded or partially shaded pond, but you need to bal-
ance this with the more intense sun of summertime.
 Your pond covering (or lack thereof). A covered pond holds
more heat than a pond with its surface area exposed to freez-
ing air. You wouldn’t heat a garage and then leave the garage
door open, would you? If you need a pond heater, cover
your pond.
To apply the coating, follow these steps:
1. Mix the coating components and apply it with a roller.
You can use a paintbrush for smaller areas or places too
convoluted for a roller. Texture-wise, it’s like painting with
thick cream or with one of the thick latex paints designed
for basement walls.
2. After the coating is dry, in two or three days, fill your
pond.
No need to rinse your pond because the coating is inert,
which means there’s nothing toxic to seep into the water
and from there into your fish’s bodies.
Be sure you read the last section “New Pond Syndrome and
What to Do about It” before you let your koi take the plunge.
Coatings come in several colors and as a clear coating. Most koi-
keepers use a black coating, which shows off the colors of their koi
better. The dark green is also pretty, we think.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 115

Applying fiberglass
An alternate sealant or coating for concrete is fiberglass. This sec-
tion covers the basics, but if you haven’t worked with fiberglass,
we suggest you ask a pro because you’re working with finely spun
glass in a resin base. For example:
 The resin cures fairly rapidly, so you don’t have much time to
work with a mixed batch.
 The fiberglass cloth can shed minute fibers, which are very
irritating to the skin.
 If you don’t mix the components correctly, the styrenes can
leach out into the pond.
To estimate the amount you need, start with the square footage of
the area to be covered — all four walls and the floor of the pond —
and add 1⁄3 more for overlap and irregularities in the surface. One
gallon of resin soaks 15 to 20 square feet of mat, the fiberglass
“fabric.” (It’s a bit like using sheets of newspaper and flour paste
but a lot more permanent.) A standard small pond, 4 feet deep and
9 x 6 feet, has 174 square feet of surface area. It will need 230 square
feet of mat and 15 to 18 gallons of resin.
To apply fiberglass, follow this procedure:
1. Apply resin with a long-napped roller or a wide paintbrush
to a section of the wall or floor of the pond (you’ll be
doing this in sections).
2. Soak a piece of fiberglass fabric or mat with resin by
dousing it in the paint tray with the resin. Apply the
wetted mat to the wetted wall or floor. Smooth it into
place and add resin to cover.
3. Soak another mat and place it on the resin-painted wall
or pond floor, next to the first. Overlap the edges 1 to
2 inches. Rewet with resin and smooth. 
4. Continue this process until you’ve covered the entire
pond surface, up to the lower edge of the capstone.
5. Sand the nonconcrete components (like the drains and
water returns) with a fine-grit sandpaper to create a sur-
face the fiberglass can cling to.
6. Soak mat strips in resin and wind them around all projec-
tions for a watertight seal.
7. After you’ve applied fiberglass to the entire pond, apply
a final gel-coat of fiberglass to smooth the entire surface.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
116

Plan to complete the application of fiberglass in one day so you
create a one-piece shell on the inside of the pond. This shell needs
to cure for at least a week (up to three weeks in cool weather!)
before you wash and rinse the pond. Then the pond is ready for
water. Fiberglass comes in clear, green, and black. As a koi keeper,
you’ll probably want to opt for the black.
New Pond Syndrome and 
What to Do about It
Before you place your koi into your new pond, you have to make
sure the pond is koi-friendly. Although you’ve followed every sug-
gestion in building your pond, it’s not going to be a great place to
put your koi — at least, not at first. We offer some suggestions on
how you and your koi can get through the adjustment period.
Aging the pond water and 
the biological filter
Few emotions are happier than building a new pond, having all the
equipment installed and working, and, with everything in place,
welcoming your koi to their new home.
While your first koi or two swim around, feeding, inspecting the
pond, and adding their own personal seal of approval to the waters,
your biofilter begins to develop its own population of nitrifying bac-
teria. Strains of “Oh, happy day . . .” begin to float through the air.
Everything looks perfect, but you can tell something’s not right.
The water values are just terrible. Although the koi are trying, there
are no friendly bacteria in the biofilter, so the filter isn’t working as
it should. The ammonia level’s too high, the nitrite level’s too high,
and the pH acts like it’s on the end of a yo-yo. What’s going on?
Any new pond (and its owner) is going to suffer new-pond syndrome
as the pond becomes a living organism of its own. The sky-high
numbers for ammonia and nitrite and the swinging pH values are
absolutely normal, and they usually last about six weeks. But as
you already know, absolutely normal doesn’t mean good. That’s
why you only put a couple of very ordinary koi into a new pond.
These are often called canary koi, and they are used as bell-
wethers. They tell you if things are going as planned with the water
chemistry. You hope they survive the process.
Chapter 7: Building Your Pond 117

You can speed up the pond-maturation process, increase your koi’s
comfort, and decrease your sleepless nights by trying one or all of
the following suggestions:
 Partial water changes help (up to 10 percent of the pond’s
volume a day).
 Give the filter maturation a boost by adding nitrifying bacteria
to the pond (you buy these in little bottles at an aquarium
store, or in larger bottles from a pond-supply store or an
online pond-supply vendor).
Some of the bacteria will cling to your pond walls, but most
will end up in the filter, which is where you want them.
 Add AmQuel Plus to bind up the ammonia and nitrites or add
a temporary chemical filter by using Zeolite.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
118
What on earth is zeolite, 
and why do you want it?
Zeolite is an inorganic volcanic-rock derivative that absorbs ammonia. It comes in
bags, and some koi keepers replace part of the biofilter media with a mesh bag of
zeolite. However, we suggest placing the bag in your filter outflow, or even in your
pond, so whatever bacteria you have in your filter can multiply and be fruitful.
Every morning, you haul out the old bag of zeolite and put in a new one, but stop! You
can reuse the bags. All you do is renew the zeolite by soaking the bag in a bucket
of saltwater overnight. Then, simply rinse and reuse the zeolite bag.
Buy two 20-pound bags of zeolite so you can alternate their use. Soak the used bag in
saltwater overnight. Then rinse it the next morning and switch it out for the other bag.
Obviously, you don’t want to do this every day for the rest of your life, but it’s doable
for a week or two as your new pond becomes established. Continue to test your
water values daily so you ‘ll know what’s going on. After a week, you can check the
values twice a week until they drift into the normal range.

In This Chapter
 Planting in the pond despite those misbehavin’ koi
 Surrounding your pond with complementary landscape
 Focusing at night: Pond lighting
 Adding those extra touches
 Considering your broader options: Patios and decks
Your pond can be the focal point of your yard, but every focal
point needs a frame. That’s where the landscaping comes in.
In this chapter, we deal with the added touches to both the inside
of your pond and its perimeter. The goal is to add to your enjoy-
ment of your koi and your pond without adversely affecting their
natural balance.
We start where it all begins — in the pond — and work outward
from there.
A Habitat Fit for Your Koi:
Furnishing Their Digs
Living plants greatly enhance the beauty of an outdoor pond,
increase its effectiveness as a functioning habitat, and attract
birds, insects, and other wildlife. No matter how focused on koi
you may be, at some point you will likely want to try your hand at
water gardening as well. This endeavor takes a good deal of care
and planning where koi are involved, but it is possible.

Avoiding the holey-plant problem
When you began thinking about a koi pond, maybe you thought 
it would be a great home for the fish and a lavish display of lilies,
lotus, and aquatic plants. After all, you see a lot of Japanese paint-
ings with koi enjoying their water lily and lotus surroundings, right?
Ahh, but that’s where artistic license comes in. Remember: Japanese
paintings are still lifes. If they were videos, the next scene would
have the koi turning and ripping a chunk out of the nearest lily pad!
Koi love plants. When they reach a length of 10 inches or so,
there’s no aquatic plant these finny pigs can say “No” to. Lotus?
Yum. Anacharis? Yum, yum. Vallisneria? Soup’s on, mate (and it’s
vegetarian!)!
In fact, just about any of your old favorites from your aquarium or
water-garden days are quite high on your koi’s greens menu. And if
they decide that the leaves are too tough, then your koi head for
all the great-tasting, spaghetti-like roots and munch on those.
Not to worry. You have some opportunities to show off your koi
and aquatic plants in same setting — you just have to keep them
separate.
Fashioning a bog pond
One way to help your koi and plants enjoy a friendly coexistence is
by creating separate subponds or bog areas that are about a foot
deep. Two methods of creating this separation are
 A low berm, or ridge, of soil: This should be seeded with
grasses or other plants, the roots of which will hold the soil 
in place.
 A brick wall: This need not be watertight, so you can either
cement the bricks together or create a more naturalistic struc-
ture by fitting stones to form the wall.
These shallow bog areas can go anywhere around your pond, but
most pond owners place them near the filter and run one of the
filter outflows through the bog. As the water flows through the bog
and into the main pond over a lower wall (see Figure 8-1), the bog
plants feed on the nitrates from the pond water, and the nitrate
levels in the pond decrease. The result? The plants flourish, the
pond’s water values improve, and the koi environment improves —
recycling at its finest!

You can find bog plant candidates at almost every garden store 
or online, and they generally range from 4 to 12 inches in height.

them a slightly deeper bog, if you can).

Creating koi-proof plant containers
Another way to simultaneously enjoy plants and koi is by con-
tainerizing the plants in the pond. Several options are possible:
 Floating life preservers for small plants: Put small, live
plants into these rigid foam disks (available at garden pond
stores) that are about 14 inches across and have four circles
cut out. Drop your plants — still in their 4-inch pots — into
the holes. The pot rims support the plants, and the unit spins
away across the surface of your pond.
You can easily remove these floating planters if you wish to
net out a koi, so they aren’t quite the hassle that a heavier 
terracotta pot or planter can be. The drawback is, of course,
that you can’t put a very large plant into a 4-inch pot.
 Heavy terracotta pots for larger plants: Place larger plants 
in these pots and put the pots on a shallow shelf. Ideally, 
this shelf should be built in during the construction phase.
However, temporary shelves can be created using cinder
blocks or bricks, positioned so that the pots placed on them
will be at or just below the water’s surface. Preformed pools
with shelves already built in are also available. Koi ignore a
planted container or pot if they can’t nibble on it, so this is
one way you can add papyrus, cattails, iris, and other emer-
gent species (plants that root in water but send stems and
leaves above the surface) to your pond. Make sure the pot is
tall enough so the upper rim is above the water level.
 A shallow flowerpot for water lilies: Plant the bulbs in the
pot and add a cylinder of rust-proof wire or plastic mesh just
inside the upper edge. The cylinder should be high enough to
reach a few inches above the water’s surface, effectively jail-
ing the water lily.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
122

As the plant grows, the mesh protects the stems while the
emergent leaves flop over the top edge of the mesh. The effect
will not be completely natural — because the mesh extends
above the water’s surface, the leaves will not float as they 
normally do. They will, however, survive and flower.
One downside of potted plants in a koi pond is the lack of water
flow in the dead areas near and on the lee side (the side that faces
away from the filter outflow) of the containers. Another problem is
the logistics: You have to move the containers whenever you net
out your fish, and like your fish, these plants will grow and the
water-filled containers will get heavier and heavier.
A koi purist may feel koi are too magnificent to share a pond, but a
lot of koi fanciers like water lilies and lotus enough to make some
concessions for them.
Opting for plastic to avoid the hassle
Plastic plants (particularly those with trailing foliage) at the edge
of a pond provide shelter and shade for koi fry and a hiding place
for large, shy koi that are hesitant to approach during feedings.
The plastic plants provide a more-or-less permanent shelter
because koi try an exploratory nibble and then give up.
You may have to pull your plastic plants out of the water and let
them dry out occasionally if you want to discourage algae from
growing on them. Otherwise, plastic plants are maintenance-free.
Stepping over the edge
(of your pond)
After the pond has its added attractions, but before you consider
the extended landscape, check the edging of your pond. Is it raised
6 inches or so to keep any sort of runoff out of your pond? (See
Chapter 7 for ways to build a raised edge during construction.)
Runoff (excessive water along with any chemicals it picks up along
the way) can come from your side yard (where your son lovingly
washes his car every Saturday morning), from your neighbor’s
prize-winning camellia garden, or from the street beyond your
yard. But no matter where it comes from, runoff is bad for your koi.
If you don’t have a raised edge, you can minimize runoff problems
from reaching your pond by digging a small trench at those points
where runoff enters and burying a black drainage pipe in the trench
Chapter 8: Making It Pretty: Landscaping the Pond 123

(a 4-inch diameter pipe will do). Some of these drainage pipes have
holes along their length to enhance their draining capacity.
Creating the Landscape 
of Your Heart’s Desire
Koi-keepers tend to go in one of two directions in landscaping their
pond. Many of them go the Japanese garden route, and others opt
for a more jungle-like environment.
The two popular styles: Japanese
and just plain wild
Part of the appeal of a Japanese landscape is its simplicity. It has
few elements to detract one’s attention from the pond, and this
understatement is on purpose. The following list identifies some of
the traditional elements that contribute to the overall appearance:
 The negative spaces are as important as the plantings.
 Asymmetrically placed plants, paths, and sculptures give a
feeling of motion within the contained space.
 Monochromatic designs of dark green foliage, dark stones,
and white gravel and sand invite contemplation.
 Color is only a temporary accent via blossoms or grasses that
change color with the seasons.
 Plant shapes are enhanced and controlled by pruning with
close attention to diagonal, horizontal, and vertical directions.
Other koi-keepers prefer lush greenery over control, and they enjoy
an environment that grows with the seasons. They see a wild land-
scape as a natural backdrop for their koi, a landscape that can take
care of itself and leaves the owners with more time to spend with
their koi. This approach is, essentially, the opposite of the Japanese
garden in all aspects. Plants that are added are allowed to grow as
they will, and native plants that establish themselves aren’t con-
trolled unless they cause a problem (for example, poison ivy).
Obviously, we can’t give you a one-size-fits-all way to deal with 
a pond landscape. But we can give you some practical guidelines
for any style of garden and show you how to play with colors and
textures.

Putting fish first and landscape
second: Controlling the sunlight
Sunlight is good for plants in the landscape, but direct sun isn’t 
all that good for koi or their ponds. Sunlight triggers algal growth,
particularly the unicellular type that turns your pond into pea soup
(that’s a genuine term, as in pea soup syndrome, in the koi world).
This growth can also make your pond uncomfortably warm for
your koi.
Although you can add a UV sterilizer to your filter to minimize
algal growth, consider sheltering your entire koi pond or at least
part of it from direct sun.
The easiest way to shade your pond is by adding a pergola. Most
pergolas have lattice tops that provide some shade, but you can
increase the shading by adding shade cloth (see Figure 8-3) that
comes in varying colors, densities, and sizes. A typical custom-cut,
12-x-12-foot, 50 percent density, black shade cloth with grommets
along the sides costs about $160. Pergolas can be bought or con-
structed in an enormous array of sizes, shapes, and materials, so 
it should be simple to find one that suits your particular pond. If
overheating or lack of a shady retreat for the koi is your concern,
locate the pergola over a section of the pond that gets the most
exposure to the afternoon sun.
Figure 8-3: A pergola.
Chapter 8: Making It Pretty: Landscaping the Pond 125

Finding plants that suit your fancy
Because your plant selection depends a great deal on where you
live — ferns do well in Washington state and Florida, for instance,
but not in Arizona — we suggest you shop locally. Of course, your
local garden store may spring to mind, but don’t forget your neigh-
bors and natural resources.
The advantage of your local garden store for your plants is one-
stop shopping. The store is likely to have three or four types of
ground-hugging evergreens and other types of plants you’re look-
ing for, along with landscape accessories, pond equipment, and,
last but not least, a new shipment of koi. (Turn your face resolutely
from the bins of koi. This is landscape-project time, not koi-buying
time. But look at Chapter 2 if you’re wondering what to call those
black and white koi, the ones with the really long fins.)
The advantage of plants from your neighbor is that they ought to
do okay in your yard as well. And you’re likely to find that neigh-
bors enjoy sharing their plants, particularly the ones they’ve done
well with.
You may be able to collect local plants to add texture to your koi
landscape. For example:
 In the Southwest, you may be able to dig and pot nonprotected
cacti and succulents.
 In northwestern and northeastern states, as well as in temper-
ate parts of Europe, you can find some beautiful and tolerant-
of-transplanting species such as aroids (philodendrons),
Jack-in-the-Pulpits, marsh marigolds, and many ferns.
 In the Southeast (especially Florida), you can find tropical
ferns, bromeliads, honeysuckle, and passion flowers.
Check the applicable laws before collecting any native plants.
Many are now fully protected in parts or all of their ranges.
Pond-edge plantings: Balancing
heights, textures, and colors
When you begin selecting plantings for the koi pond, think of stair
steps — the lower plants next to the pond, the knee-highs a bit 
farther back, then the waist-high bushes, and finally the trees or 
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
126

a hedge and fencing. You can vary this order a bit, of course, by
bringing a taller plant to the pond edge to soften the lines.
After mentally sorting your plants of choice by height, factor in the
sunlight. Landscape plantings for a sunlit pond at almost any lati-
tude include the following:
 At the pond’s edge, English ivy or a compact or dwarf 
sansevieria
 At knee height, day lilies and zinnias (Crocus, jonquils, 
and daffodils also work for northern climes.)
 At waist height, mallows, cannas, and pussy willows
 As a hedge, shrubs such as boxwood, Japanese garden
juniper, and bayberry
Plants that do well with just three or four hours of sun a day
include the following:
 At the pond’s edge, woodfern or royal fern
 At knee height, ragwort or sage
 At waist height, plantain lily or lady fern
 As a hedge, azalea or rhododendron
Within this category of partial sun lovers are the many varieties 
of ornamental grasses. These plants are attractive year-round,
acknowledging winter by a color shift in the seed heads or stalks.
See Table 8-2 for a listing of popular grasses that can provide vary-
ing heights for your pond landscape. Figure 8-4 shows what a few
of them look like.
All the ornamental grasses in this list like semimoist gardens, and
as a general rule, the taller the grass, the more water it needs. Your
local extension agent can advise you on which ornamental grasses
work in your area and what invasive species to avoid.

Bamboo has 1,500 varieties to choose from, and their mature size
can be as short as 4 inches. Many originated in mountains and are
very cold-hardy.
Spreading bamboo propagates by underground runners that pop
up anywhere from 2 to 10 feet from the parent plant. Bamboo in the
genus Pleoblastus, for instance, look great on paper. Some of them
stay very small, from 18 inches to 3 feet, and they’re hardy to 10
degrees F. But they’re runners. If you buy a Pleoblastus, confine it 
in a pot, or you may rue the day you bought the plant.
For ponds in temperate climates, you may choose to have all or
most of your plants naturalized and in the ground. But just as you
pot some types of bamboo, you can pot other tropical plants to
create a beautiful garden during warm months and then move 
the plants to a protected and warmed indoor spot for the winter
months. Tropical beauties such as New Guinea impatiens, various
bromeliads, some orchids, peace lilies, and philodendrons can pro-
vide immense seasonal beauty to your koi garden.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
128

When you’re considering plants for texture and color, plan for
groups of like plants that you accent with one or two plants of 
a different foliage type or foliage color. This uneven balance has
more impact than the one-of-these, one-of-those gardens. For 
textures, use evergreens, grasses, and leafy shrubs; for colors, 
consider dwarf red maples, hostas, and caladiums.
Setting the Mood with Lighting
Lighting extends the useful time you can spend with your koi, 
and that’s a good thing. By adding light to your deck or patio, you
can share a very early breakfast or an evening meal there; accent
lights in the koi garden provide additional depth to your night
views. But the lights in your koi pond may just please you most
because you can see your finny friends as they glide around in the
evening. Adding lighting is no big deal, even after your construc-
tion and landscape’s complete. This section sheds some light on
two varieties: submersibles and accent lights.
Lighting up from down below:
Submersible lights
Most add-on submersible lighting units are mug-sized black boxes
with a light fixture sticking out of the top of each box. Because the
lights are wired in sequence, you simply lower the boxes into place
and plug in the electrical cord.
Although you have your choice of clear or colored light bulbs, 
koi-keepers tend to snicker at the colored bulb route. After all, 
you already own some of the most spectacularly beautiful fish 
in the world — but hey, if you want colored lights, go ahead.
Turn the pond lights out when you go inside so your koi can sleep.
When you can’t close your eyes, darkness makes it much easier. (In
case you didn’t know, koi lie on the bottom of their pond to sleep.)
Lighting your koi from 
above: Accent lights
Several varieties of accent lights are on the market. Your pond or
lighting store should be able to provide you with some ideas for
consideration.
Chapter 8: Making It Pretty: Landscaping the Pond 129

The prettiest we’ve seen are just decorative — not big enough to
shed a lot of light. These LED lights sit atop long plastic sticks that
you stick in the ground. Their stems light at the top and then wave
in the breeze.
Lanterns are another form of accent lighting that seem to fit in
every koi garden. They stand alone and are either wired for elec-
tricity or literally candle powered. Two examples are
 Lanterns that light pathways or serve as exclamation points in
the garden (usually 3 feet tall or higher)
 Snow-viewing lanterns that are placed next to the pond (usually
knee high). Much favored in Japanese gardens, snow lanterns,
or yukimidoro, have a wide roof that collects snow, which is
then illuminated by the light chamber below. In warmer sea-
sons, the illuminated lantern casts an interesting mix of light
and shadow on the water’s surface.
Keep taller plantings away from these lower lanterns so you can
enjoy the light and not trip over them.
Adding the Finishing Touches:
Garden Accessories
Garden accessories include the statues, benches, and other non-
growing elements of the pond landscape. Sometimes the acces-
sories are functional, like the filters disguised as Japanese lanterns,
so their location is predetermined. Other accessories, such as stat-
ues and gazing balls, are just for fun, so you can place them where
you’ll enjoy them the most. (See the color section of this book for
some stellar setups.) This short section offers suggestions on two
of the larger accessories in your landscape, statues and benches.
Planting a statue
When you’re shopping for statues for your koi garden, keep the 
following suggestions in mind:
 The emphasis is on the koi pond and the koi, not the back-
drop; keep statuary less than 4 feet tall and soften their
impact by adding a few plants beside them.
 Select pieces that accent your pond and don’t detract from it.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
130

A statue of a small boy kneeling beside the pond with his
hand outstretched as if feeding koi is a good accent. A casting
of Rodin’s The Kiss may prove to be a distraction!
Not all statues are created equal in terms of outdoor durability.
Look for materials that stand up under outdoor use, such as resin,
Durastone (a cementlike product), or bronze. Bronze, as the top of
the line, develops a great patina in the koi garden. Unfortunately,
the weight of a bronze accessory can make installation a bit of a
challenge.
Positioning a bench
Place benches in the shade so you can avoid the direct sunlight
and still see your pond. Benches with a back invite sitting more
than those without, and two benches that are close to each other
make it easier for your friends to join you in admiring your fish.
The all-metal styles are attractive but unyielding — you’re apt to
end up with the imprint of the cast roses on your body when you
stand up! Designs that use wooden slats for the seating and back
have a bit more give to them, but you’ll have to replace the slats
eventually.
Going the Extra Mile: Adding 
a Patio or Deck
As you begin to plot out where to add plants and lighting, remem-
ber to leave a large, open area next to the pond, both as a work
space (filter changes and repair, an area from which to net fish or
perform routine maintenance, and so on) and as a lounging area.
Patios — Simply beautiful
As with building a pond, your finances, construction skills, and
time limitations will be the deciding factors in determining how
you’ll proceed when it comes to patio construction. Considering
pond-side surfaces, patios are, of course, the easiest to build and
the simplest to change. Patio bricks, called pavers, come in all
sizes, shapes, and colors, and they’re readily available from home
improvement stores.
Chapter 8: Making It Pretty: Landscaping the Pond 131

Buy pavers a few at a time or all at once as your budget and time
permit. Their real advantage is their building-block capacity that
allows you to move your patio around, if and when you decide to
add another pond or enlarge your present pond.
You can do the job all with one kind of paver, or you can formulate
designs with pavers of different shapes and colors and then edge
the patio with paving bricks of the same or contrasting colors. In
reality, the patio can be as simple or as intricate as your pocket-
book and energy level allow.
Bear in mind that patios are not solid, permanent surfaces.
Therefore, the surface may settle or shift during wet weather, and
plants can grow up through the spaces between the stones. Most
troubling are tree roots that lift the stones as they grow below.
Therefore, be sure to plan your location carefully, and consult 
an expert if you are at all unsure.
Decks — Naturally versatile
You may decide that building a pond-side deck is easier than 
lugging pavers. A deck is a bigger investment and is more difficult
to modify at a later date, but it’s a wonderful addition to your
pond. We suggest you build your deck from treated 2 x 4s because
they’re easy to work with, resist warping better than larger widths
of wood, and are available at every home improvement store. Just
don’t use treated wood for a pond overhang.
Why do we think decks are better? Pure and simple: They’re far more
versatile in terms of shape, materials, size, and other construction-
related options. In addition, water never pools on a deck, they’re
easy to clean by sweeping, and their wood construction is slightly
more forgiving than pavers when you drop a breakable item.
Besides the versatility in their construction, decks are equally 
versatile in their placement. You can situate your deck so it stops
short at the side of your pond or, with a bit more planning and
effort, you can build it to extend a foot or two over the edge of
your pond. If your pond lacks underwater lights, add lights to the
underside of the overhanging deck. In the evenings you’ll be able
to watch your koi as they swim in and out of the lights.

You’ve gone to considerable time and expense in designing and
constructing your pond. Now that the pond is ready and a half-
dozen test koi have moved in, you invite some friends and neigh-
bors to celebrate with a barbeque cookout. Everything’s perfect.
But the next day you step outside, look at the pond, and wonder,
“What do I do now? Can I keep it going?”
Taking care of a pond is like taking care of any complex organism.
As long as you follow the rules, are ready for a few exceptions to
those rules, and pay attention to pond chemistry, you and your koi
are headed for a long, happy association. This chapter helps you
maintain your pond year-round by walking you through the regular,
routine tasks and explaining how the seasons affect pond care. We
also guide you through the basics of water testing and how to
interpret your results.
Maintaining Your Equipment
Everything wears out, and in keeping with the “no surprises” con-
cept in pond-keeping, you want to know when to replace different
items of equipment. See Table 9-1 for specifics. Knowing the typical
life of a filter or a pump gives you a heads-up so you can check out
the new technology and do some comparison shopping.

Testing for Proper Water Chemistry
You can’t tell whether the chemistry in your pond is right simply
by looking at the water. Even if it looks clean (koi-keepers use the
term gin clear), the water can be laden with bad components, like
ammonia and nitrites, and shy of critical elements, like oxygen. So
even though your filter and water pump, air pump, and pond skim-
mer are working together to rid the pond of the physical and chem-
ical waste, you need to monitor the water quality to make certain
your equipment’s doing the job right.
All you need is a pond thermometer and two or three water-testing
kits. You need to test for ammonia, nitrite, salt, pH, dissolved
oxygen, and chlorine/chloramine. Note: You can buy multitest 
kits that test four or five of these items, but you may need to buy
separate kits for chlorine/chloramines and dissolved oxygen. Pet
or garden-pond stores have these kits, or you can purchase them
from an online vendor (searching under outdoor pond test kits will
yield good results).
The kits are easy to use and take only a few moments to give you
readings. For a new pond, test the water twice a week until the
values stabilize (about six weeks). After that initial period, test
your pond water once a week.
Be consistent by testing at the same time each day. Water chem-
istry values change as the day progresses, so testing your ammo-
nia values, for instance, at the same time each day gives you a
more accurate comparison. (Most koi owners test their water
around 4 p.m., just before they feed their koi.)
Log your water-testing readings, noting the day and time for each
one. The numbers or values help you track your pond’s chemistry
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
134

so you know when you need to make adjustments. We use a small
spiral notebook that we keep in the box with the water test kits.
(The notebook looks awful, but the data’s good, and any day now
we’re going to spring for one of those field notebooks with the
waterproof paper.)
The following sections explain the values you need to track.
Ammonia
Your goal on ammonia levels is zero, but your readings may change
depending on the time of day you take them. The ammonia levels
rise a couple of hours after you feed your fish as the fish process
their food and excrete the leftovers into the water. As the pH natu-
rally rises through the course of a day, the ammonia is temporarily
converted to ammonium as each ammonia molecule takes on an
additional hydrogen atom (conversely, when pH falls, the extra
hydrogen atom is plucked off the ammonium, converting it back to
ammonia). This cycle explains why you want to test for ammonia
at the same time of day (or go crazy trying to figure out what those
ammonia levels really mean).
You can lower high ammonia levels by dilution, in other words a
partial water change, which we describe in the section “When You
Need to Change the Water,” later in this chapter.
But when the readings are consistently too high, you need to figure
out the reason.
 Is your pond new? New pond syndrome, as it’s called, is char-
acterized by changing water chemistry readings that are too
high or too low. This problem may take six weeks to stabilize.
This is a natural process, and, if your pond was set up prop-
erly, should pass without incident. Do monitor your koi for
signs of stress, however, and perform a partial water change
(see “When You Need to Change the Water,” later in this chap-
ter) if they appear to be in trouble.
 Is your pump doing the job you thought it would, or do you
have too many fish for your biofilter? Ammonia values can
spike even if you’ve had your pond in operation for years.
(Those little rascals grew, didn’t they, and how can you get 
rid of fish that know your voice and respond to their name?)
To check the gallons-per-hour of your pump, attach a flow
meter (available at an outdoor pond supply store) to the
output and check it after 15 minutes. By multiplying the 15-
minute reading by 8, you can determine if the pump is pump-
ing enough water to circulate the water in your pond every
two hours.
Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Pond 135

Depending on your biofilter media (see Chapter 6 for info on this
essential piece of equipment), you may be able to switch to a
newer high-surface-area biomedia that increases the surface area
of your biofilter. As a basic figure, plan on 24 square feet of biofilter
surface for every pound of koi (the average 12-inch koi weighs 0.7
pound, or about 11 ounces), so the 24-square-foot surface accom-
modates approximately one 12-inch koi, with a small safety margin.
pH
The perfect pH range for a koi pond is 6.8 to 7.2, but koi can do
quite well with a broader range, from 6.5 to 9.0. When your pH
reaches the lower end of that range, however, you need to worry
about your biofilter as well as your koi. The friendly bacteria in 
a biofilter quit working if the pH goes below 6.0. As the bacteria
begin to die off, their vital role in converting ammonia to less toxic
nitrites and nitrates will cease. Ammonia levels will skyrocket,
often very quickly, and your fish will become stressed and may die.
Don’t take any single pH reading to heart. Your pond is a dynamic
system, and its pH changes during the passage of a day, with lower
values in the morning and higher ones in the afternoon. A heavy
rain can nudge your pond toward a lower, acidic pH, and some
pond additives push the numbers toward the higher alkaline side.
If the fish look fine and other chemistry values are okay, relax. Koi
are adaptive as long as the pH changes aren’t sudden or extreme.
Your biological filter and weekly water changes help narrow the
range of your pond’s pH values, but don’t be surprised if you get 
a lot of uninvited advice about pH. Well-intended people will insist
(in gentle, soft voices) that adding baking soda is an easy, safe way
to lower the pH. Keep in mind (and whisper it gently back to these
nice folks if you want) that pH, ammonia, and nitrite are all inter-
connected. Using a sledgehammer like baking soda on pH is a good
way to throw your water chemistry values seriously and immedi-
ately out of whack. You don’t need to manipulate your pond chem-
istry values that badly. Skip the baking soda.
Nitrites
Like ammonia, nitrites are byproducts of digestion, and you want
them to be as low as you can get them. The best nitrite level to
shoot for is zero, but this may take a while if you’re working with a
new pond that hasn’t settled down. (The cyclical chemistry of new
ponds includes rising nitrite levels as ammonia levels decrease.)
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
136

Trying to figure out this chemistry balance can be confusing to a
new koi-keeper, especially considering that each pond is unique in
this regard; don’t hesitate to call on a more experienced keeper for
advice. You should also check your local public aquarium — the
staff or volunteers at such institutions are often happy to help seri-
ous hobbyists. Test for nitrites at the same time of day, so you
have similar readings to compare.
Your filter and its friendly bacteria generally take care of nitrites,
converting them to nitrates, which are essentially harmless to your
koi. You can help lower nitrite levels by partially changing the water
each week or by letting the water from the filter run through a
plant-filled sluice on its way back to the pond. Plants use nitrites as
a food source and will contribute favorably to your water quality.
To make use of plants, arrange your filter’s outflow to pass through
a plastic pond or wide PVC pipe stocked with aquatic or emergent
plants (those that grow with their roots in water and stems and
leaves above it). Water hyacinth and water lettuce are particularly
hardy (if given lots of sun) and amazingly efficient at removing
nitrites and other impurities from the water. Because of their
aggressive growth rate, water hyacinth are not legal in all states,
but a wide variety of other plants will work equally well. Employees
at outdoor pond and garden supply shops should be able to guide
you. Please also see Chapter 8 for more information on pond plants.
Dissolved oxygen
The amount of oxygen in your pond water is important, and
although you’d expect it to stay steady, it’s a dynamic, moving
number. Oxygen is used by the friendly bacteria in your filter, by
your fish, and by any decomposing organic material in the pond.
Oxygen is replaced at the surface of the pond at the water-air 
interface (the area where air and water meet). To increase the
pond’s absorption of oxygen, simply increase the surface area of
the water. We’re not talking about stretching water, just exposing
more of it to the air. Splashing and bubbling via air pumps and air-
stones, foam fractionators, and waterfalls all do the trick.
Adding oxygenation devices to your pond is a good idea if you have
low oxygen readings, but if your readings are consistently low, you
need to figure out the reason. The following are possible causes:
 Ponds with poor water circulation (due to an awkward pond
shape or a water pump that’s too small) usually have a dead
space (nonmoving water that sinks to the bottom of the
pond). This nonmoving water isn’t exposed to air and can’t
pick up oxygen.

of algae in the pond — can cause a rapid drop in oxygen
levels. A number of factors can precipitate a bloom, some of
which are related to the particular algae’s biology and a bit
complex to go into here. Often such blooms are associated
with hot, sunny weather and a spike in nitrite levels from fish
waste, the presence of a dead animal, or fertilizer washing
into the pond.
An overcrowded pond and hot weather can deplete water of
its oxygen. (Fish respire faster in hot weather and, as a result,
remove more oxygen from the water.)
 Do you have too many fish for the size of your pond and the
size of your pump and filter? (See Chapter 6 for a simple cal-
culation of the best ratio.)
 Ponds at high altitudes (Hello, Denver!) are behind the oxygen
curve to start with; the oxygen level is lower at high altitudes
than at low altitudes. If you live in such an area, be sure to
consult with local experts as to the water pump needed for
your pond. In all likelihood, you will need one that is stronger
than those recommended in Chapter 6.
When You Need to 
Change the Water
Partial water changes (and adding a dechlorinator) are a natural
part of housekeeping for koi-keepers. The following are two obvi-
ous benefits:
 They’re an easy, inexpensive way to maintain or clean your
pond’s water chemistry because they dilute all the bad values
that result from koi waste.
 They help moderate your pond’s temperature, cooling the
sun-heated pool in the summer and warming the chilled pool
in the winter.
Water changes are most important during the summer when the
fish are active and eating heavily. You should do a 20 to 30 percent
water change once a week in the summer. You can lessen the fre-
quency a bit during early spring and fall (every 10–14 days), but
once per week is the best overall policy.
Before you begin the water change, buy a flow meter for your hose
so you know how many gallons you’re putting in your pond, rather
than guessing. The meter also helps you know the correct amount
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
138

of dechlor to add and (if your pond is salted) the amount of addi-
tional salt you need to bring the readings to the original level.
Direct the overflow to your lawn or garden. For ponds with salted
water, divert your filter’s outflow into your wastewater system
because the salt is harmful to most plants.
An alternate method to using a flow meter is to mark your outdoor
hose spigot at a quarter-turn and time how long it takes to fill a 
5-gallon bucket when the spigot is turned to that marking. That
way, you can add the hose to your pond, turn the spigot to the
marking, and set a timer for a measured water change.
Perhaps the easiest way to effect a partial water change is to redi-
rect the outflow from your filter so that the water exits the pond.
Another useful method is to use a small submersible pump. You
may already have one on hand to operate a waterfall, or you can
purchase one specifically for water changes. (It’s always good to
have one on hand anyway — if your main pump fails, the sub-
mersible can be used to circulate and oxygenate the water until
you replace your main unit.)
To change the water, simply attach plastic tubing (a variety of
widths and lengths are available at pet and pond stores) to the
pump’s outflow port and pump out 20 to 30 percent of the pond’s
water (if possible, direct the water to a garden or somewhere else
where it will be of use). The replacement water should be dechlori-
nated and about the same temperature as what’s already in the
pond (unless you’re trying to raise or lower the temperature).
You can also use hand-held siphons (the water is pumped by
rubber ball into a length of plastic tubing) or siphon the pond
water out by filling a hose with water and submerging one end in
the pond. However, these methods require gravity’s help, so you’ll
need to have a low-lying area right next to the pond.
For small ponds or in an emergency (or if you enjoy the exercise),
you can also use a 5-gallon bucket to remove the appropriate
amount of water.
Maintaining a Stable Temperature
Koi do best at 70 to 82 degrees F. However, nothing is ideal.
Sudden, unexpected temperature drops can stress your koi. 
We remember some fall days in Colorado when the temperature
dropped from 65 degrees in the morning to 21 degrees in the 
afternoon. When you get caught by one of these switches, add salt
(available in bulk at outdoor pond supply stores) to your pond at
Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Pond 139

the rate of 3 pounds per 100 gallons for a 0.3 percent reading
(roughly a third of 1 percent) to help your koi deal with the tem-
perature drop. Although salt dissolves rapidly in water, avoid
dumping it in one heap. Rather, mix the salt with water in a clean
plastic pail, and pour this into the pond at your filter’s outflow. You
can keep track of the amount of salt in your pond, especially after 
a partial water change, with one of the tests in your testing kit or
you can buy a digital salt meter. Either method will yield accurate
results.
To help you keep your fish comfy cozy, this section offers ways to
deal with colder and warmer conditions.
When the weather gets cold
Koi-keepers who live in the extreme southern parts of the United
States (in the United States Department of Agriculture zones 9 and
10) don’t need to worry much about pond temperatures. Cold
weather in these areas means less than 60 degrees and it rarely
lasts more than a day or two. Partial water changes (remember 
to use a dechlorinating chemical preparation) or a pond cover 
can keep the pond water warm.
The rest of us, left out in the cold so to speak, have the choice of
covering or heating our ponds or doing neither.
Covering the pond
If you live in an area with no snowfall, then building and covering a
simple frame around your pond is a feasible project for the do-it-
yourselfer. The process entails building a wooden or metal frame-
work around your pond and covering the frame with 6-millimeter
plastic sheeting, acrylic panels, or even bubble wrap. Be sure to
use rustproof products, such as copper screws or plastic ties or
strips, to attach the cover material to the frame. You need about 
a foot of space between the pond and the cover for air exchange.
Remember to create an access panel of some sort (a simple way to
do this is to secure one corner of the cover with a length of plastic
tubing that can be easily untied) so you can check the water tem-
perature. See Figure 9-1 for a sample of this pond cover.
Areas that normally get snowfall require a pond cover with a bit of
a slant to the roof to avoid the weight of snow buildup. Building a
cover like this can be as simple as making two of the four support
legs longer. Koi pond covers are available in knock-down (KD),
easy-to-assemble kits for round ponds up to 30 feet in diameter.
See Figure 9-2 for more details. (The manufacturer says one person
can set up a koi pond cover in 30 minutes with no special tools.)

Figure 9-3 shows a lower pond cover with bubble wrap in place.
Multiple layers of wrap provide additional insulation.
Bringing koi indoors
Many pond keepers in the extreme northern area of the United States
with ponds less than 5 feet deep generally bring their koi indoors
during the winter (for the basics of an indoor pond, see Chapter 10).
Letting a deep pond freeze on top
Other northern koi-keepers with ponds that are too deep to freeze
solid prepare their pond for the winter by doing the following:
 Prepping their fish, making sure none of them have health
problems going into their wintertime slowdown
Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Pond 141

 Consider turning off the filters (many experts insist the 
filter be left on; ask your koi friends what they do)
 Adding an ice porthole so gas exchange can take place
An ice porthole is a bottomless wooden box about 2 feet x 2
feet with a hinged top. You set the box at the edge of the pond
with the bottom edge of the porthole extending a foot down
into the water. A 100-watt light bulb set into the top of the 
box provides enough warmth to keep ice from forming inside
the box. Air exchange occurs at the water’s surface inside 
the box. The electric cord connected to the bulb should, of
course, be rated for outdoor use and can be plugged into 
the outdoor outlets that power your filtration system.
Figure 9-3: A simple pond cover that uses bubble wrap as the cover.
With these basic winterizing steps, most koi get through the winter
and the equally hazardous spring warm-up.
Heating the pond
Some owners choose to cover and heat the koi pond over the
winter. These owners point out the following advantages:
 They can interact with their fish all year round.
 Owners have no worries concerning fish that have been weak-
ened by winter’s cold temperatures, fasting, and the resultant
metabolic changes.
 The fish stay active, are fed regularly, and can digest the food
because they’re warmer.
 The fish grow all year and maintain their weight better than
koi who overwinter without heat.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
142

But is heating your pond right for you? We can’t guess what 
your heating costs may be (both in setup and in operating costs)
because each pond is different; geographical area, size, and shape
of your pond are all factors. You may want to talk to a couple of
koi-keepers in your area and representatives from firms that build
and install pond heaters, just so you have an idea of the cost of
heating your pond.
If you know how many watts the system requires, you can figure
out your electricity costs with these steps:
1. Divide the number of watts by 1,000 to get kilowatts.
2. Multiply the kilowatts by 8,760 (the number of hours in a
year) to figure how many kilowatts you’ll use a year.
3. Multiply that product by your utility’s charges for a 
kilowatt hour to find out the cost of running the heater
for a year.
Dealing with hotter temps
As the days heat up during the summer, check your pond tempera-
ture in the afternoon, when the heat is highest. If the water temper-
ature creeps up to the 80s, you need to act to protect your koi:
 Make a partial (20 to 30 percent) water change, adding cold
water to gradually reduce the pond’s temperature.
 Sling a shade cloth up over your pergola framework to reduce
the heating effect of the sun.
Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Pond 143
Heated ponds bring sizzling sales
The trend toward heating over the winter is growing. In Japan, koi were tradition-
ally overwintered in mud ponds, and the annual pond draining and harvest of the
koi was a big event. Beginning in the 1970s, however, breeders found that the grow-
ing popularity of the hobby supported the expense of heated winter quarters for
their koi. They had higher survival numbers, particularly with the yearlings. (The first
winter was considered a great winnower of yearling koi.) In addition, the bigger fish
didn’t falter during the winter, they got even bigger and fatter during the summer,
and they commanded higher prices in October during the traditional koi sales event.
For these big-number breeders, heated ponds pay off.

 Activate a waterfall feature or pond bubbler. This action will
help to increase your water’s dissolved oxygen content (warm
water holds less oxygen than does cool water, and also
increases the koi’s rate of respiration).
Keeping Predators Away
Oh-oh! You’re missing a koi?
This is fair warning: Other sentient beings on this earth enjoy koi
almost as much as you do. In fact, they may enjoy koi more than
you do. To you the colorful fish are living gems. But for those other
admirers, whether two-footed, four-footed, six-footed, or no-footed,
the koi are a feast in the most literal sense.
The kinds of koi predator you need to reckon with will depend on
two factors: your pond setting and the size of your fish. Koi-keepers
in rural areas or in wooded urban areas find raccoons and herons
to be their major predators. Urbanites add cats to that list and
move herons down to third place.
Larger koi are safer from predation than smaller koi simply
because fewer creatures can tackle them.
Your predators’ success depends to a large extent on the steepness
of the sides of your pond. Ponds with shelves for potted plants pro-
vide a ready-made table for nabbing koi because the innocent but
curious fish like to come up and see what’s going on. Vertical sides,
on the other hand, provide a safeguard against predators; the fish
can quickly move deeper into the pond and beyond reach.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
144
When Rover comes over
We have to admit that predation can occur when you least expect it. We had never
thought much about domestic dogs being koi predators until a koi-keeper told us
about her cocker spaniel. The pond was new, and her dog spent a lot of time look-
ing into the water, evidently fascinated by the koi that swam at his feet.
The koi may have been equally curious. One day the owner came out to find her dog
standing over a 14-inch koi he had just lifted from the water. Both dog and koi
seemed surprised. The owner put the koi back in the pond and quickly trained the
dog to stay away from the pond.
Moral of the story? If Rover seems curious about your koi, introduce them to each
other so he’ll understand that these are pets, too. Use whatever method has worked
with your dog in other training situations to accomplish this.

These are additional suggestions for keeping your koi safe:
 A fence — even a low fence — around your yard helps deter
many predators.
 By keeping brush and other natural cover away from the
pool’s edge, you can deter most snakes.
 Vigilance on your part in combination with a free-ranging dog
and a bird-netting pond cover can thwart the efforts of preda-
tory wading birds. If the netting droops to the ground, it also
prevents most large frogs (bullfrogs are the most serious
threat) from gaining pool access.
 Net out turtles and large frogs that move into your pond. Take
them to the nearest patch of suitable habitat and release. (Be
very careful how you handle large snapping turtles!)
 A number of aquatic insects will prey upon small koi. While
dragonfly larvae and water scorpions can take only fry, giant
water bugs will attack fish of 4–5 inches in length. All of these
insects (especially the giant water bug, fondly referred to in
some locales as the “toe biter”) can administer painful bites,
so use a net to capture and release them in a local pond.
 Treat snakes with caution (but not fear and loathing) and call
a removal service if you don’t feel qualified to remove and
relocate them yourself.
The one creature that you’re most likely to have recurring prob-
lems with is that cuddly-appearing (but ferociously defensive),
food-washing, masked marauder of the evening — the raccoon.
Raccoons attempt to capture koi of any size and injure those 
that escape.
Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Pond 145
Beware the nighttime bandit
Raccoons aren’t just smart, they’re street-smart as well. They’ve adapted to life in the
inner city and in the forested outskirts. After they locate a food source, they return to it
time and again. Although most raccoons run from dogs and people, some — especially
if they’re very hungry or very well acclimated to people, stand their ground and choose
confrontation over retreat.
Raccoons may carry rabies and distemper. Persistent raccoons must be trapped
and physically relocated miles away or destroyed. Look in the phone book for a pest
exterminator who deals with wildlife.

Caring for the Pond through 
the Four Seasons
Getting a running start on pond care each season is like entering
data into your tax software all year long — you have a lot less
stress when the deadline hits. The following sections walk you
through pond maintenance for each season of the year.
Falling into a slower routine
Your primary goal in autumn is to remove extraneous organic
matter from your pond and filter. Anything organic decomposes
very slowly during the winter, but when spring hits and the water
warms, the bacterial bloom will overwhelm your koi.
Other chores to take care of before the snow flies include
 Hosing off the filter mats or the bioballs or turning the 
backwash valve on your bead filter.
 Installing your leaf netting (a net cover to prevent leaves from
entering the pond) before the leaves begin to fall and making
sure your cover or frame is accessible and ready to install.
 Feeding your koi a high protein diet until the first cold spell,
and then switching to the wheat-germ-based diet (see Chapter
11 for more on these foods).
 Trimming any plants that dangle into the pond. The cold
weather will kill the foliage and the debris will end up in 
your pond.
 Checking your koi for health problems and correcting them.
Their immune system slows down after the pond cools.
 Installing an ice porthole or heater, if either are required.
Settling into winter
After the leaves on local trees have all fallen, take the leaf cover off.
Depending on your setup, you have different tasks at this point to
prepare your pond and koi for the coldest season. The following
points cover each of those arrangements:
 Ponds with heaters: Set the thermostat at 62 degrees. Your
fish will eat a bit at this temperature, but not with the eager-
ness that they show in the summer. Offer food once per day,
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
146

and carefully monitor the amount they eat and make adjust-
ments as necessary. Please see Chapter 11 for more details.
 Unheated ponds: Stop feeding your koi when the water 
temperature is below 52 degrees. (Their digestive systems are
working too slowly to digest the food, and the bacteria in your
biofilter can’t keep up with an ammonia/nitrite spike.)
Keep your filter running to deal with fish waste, but turn off
the aeration system in the pond because the movement chills
the water.
 Uncovered ponds where the access to the pond is through
an ice porthole: Check the porthole daily to make certain the
light bulb is still on, and replace the bulb before it reaches the
allotted hour-life (see the side of the bulb package for this
number).
Opening the porthole to check on your chilled koi in midwinter
can be a bit traumatic because your koi are lying semicomatose
on the bottom of your pond. Some koi are inclined toward one
side, and those that are swimming are moving in slow motion.
This is normal behavior for very cold koi.
When the temperature hits 60 degrees, you can begin to feed your
fish. Use wheat germ–based food (see Chapter 11) and feed only
enough to be consumed in two minutes. (Wheat germ is easier for
koi to digest than the more complex proteins.)
Make a 10 percent water change every week or two weeks.
Spring into (careful) action
The days are getting longer, the sky is warmer, spring is right
around the corner, and all of your wintertime worries are over. No,
sorry to say. April is the cruelest month, and it isn’t just because 
of love. This is the time of year that overwintering koi die. Their
metabolisms have been drastically altered to deal with the low
temperatures and lack of food, and any koi that were not in tip-top
shape in the fall are likely to be in a vulnerable state by spring.
At the end of winter, chilled koi (and their immune systems) begin
to perk up. That’s the good news.
The bad news is that your koi are behind the curve when it comes
to waking up. All the bacteria and parasites that have spent the
last couple of months slumbering (no, they’re not dead, just rest-
ing) in the bottom mulm (the sticky layer of organic material such
as unfiltered droppings, odd bits of leaves, and dead plants) of
your koi pond are awake and hungry. Like a herd of very tiny
Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Pond 147

Tasmanian devils, they’re scrounging around for food, and mulm is
just the start of what they’ll feed on. Bacteria will move into any
breach in the koi’s skin and immediately start multiplying, and 
the external parasites will begin feeding and reproducing. They’re
more awake than your koi’s immune system. Keep an eye out for
ailments such as hole in the side, anchor worms, or fungus. (See
Chapter 13 for more on ulcers and parasites and how to deal with
them.) Watch your koi for flashing behavior, curving the body to
scrape along the pond bottom or sides.
Most koi-keepers either feed very lightly or don’t feed at all until
the water edges upward past 60 degrees. Then the feedings should
start small. (We’re not trying to protect your koi’s delicate diges-
tive systems. Koi are really just fancy digestive tubes, with just a
two-hour delay between feeding and excreting.) The goal is to
avoid an increase in ammonia and nitrite levels while your biofilter
bacteria become active.
As the water temperature creeps past 70 degrees, you can gradually
increase the amount of food, but be stingy! If your koi take more
than a minute and a half to eat, you’re feeding too much. Feed small
amounts twice a day, and test your water for ammonia and nitrite
content at least twice a week. Make partial water changes (5 to 15
percent) weekly to help keep nitrite and ammonia levels down.
Easing into summer
It’s summertime and the living is, well, weedy. The increased levels
of sunlight may trigger an exuberant hair algae bloom, a weed that
looks like green, slimy cotton candy. (If you run your fingers through
that floating filamentous gunk in your pond, you’ll see what we
mean.) This algae is commonly known as blanket weed. In addition
to being ugly, blanket weed is an oxygen stealer at night.
Discourage blanket weed by
 Shading at least part of your pond; blanket weed grows like
crazy in direct sunlight.
 Using a commercial blanket weed killer, one that’s safe for use
with koi. These work by removing phosphate and other key
nutrients from the water (which blanket weed needs) so the
weed starves and shrivels.
 Adding barley straw to your pond. As the straw decomposes,
it discourages blanket weed. (Tropical-fish keepers from way
back recognize barley as a prime source of infusoria, tiny
micro-organisms that are an important food source for many
newly hatched fish.)
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
148

You can buy barley straw pads packaged just for this purpose
at your local pond or aquarium shop or online. Or, if you need
a 50-pound bale, purchase it as stock feed at your local feed
store. Because each pond is unique when it comes to blanket
weed, you should consult a local retailer or pond owner as to
the appropriate amount of straw to use. (We put a chunk of
the bale into a nylon mesh bag used for laundering delicate
washables, add a rock for ballast, and hang the bag in our
pond.) Replace the barley straw pad every three months
during warm weather.
You can also buy barley straw extract from some outdoor
pond stores, or via the Internet, and not have to wait a couple
of days before the blanket weed diminishes. Your retailer can
guide you as to the appropriate use of this product in your
particular situation.
 Using an electronic device that disperses a mineral that kills
blanket weed. Note: The manufacturer apologetically explains
that the device is not suitable for use with invertebrates or
mollusks, so kiss goodbye, metaphorically, any dragonfly
larvae or snails you may have in your koi pond (Where have
they been hiding? Koi love snails, and not platonically.).
As temperatures rise, the oxygen-carrying capacity of water drops.
On hot days more koi are near the surface of the water. The koi that
are gasping at the surface are seeking air. Add aeration via water
bubblers, fountains, or a waterfall. The increased aeration these
provide allows the fish to obtain more oxygen. A partial water
change of 20 to 30 percent can also help by temporarily lowering
the water’s temperature (please see Chapter 9 for more details).
Summertime is the best time to bring out your high-protein koi
foods. Your koi are hungry, having awakened from their wintertime
rest during the spring months, and they want food, glorious food.
With these rapacious appetites comes a big increase in ammonia
and fish poop production, so clean your mechanical and biological
filters weekly.
When you’re shopping around, keep an eye out for end-of-the-
season bargains. For example, filter material goes on sale in late
summer. You can stock up and save a bundle (which you’ll immedi-
ately spend on koi, because this is when they come out of the mud
ponds in Japan). The downside, of course, is finding a place to put
the items until you need them. But isn’t that why car trunks and
deck-side storage benches were invented?

F
or most people, an indoor pond is an alternate, second 
choice to an outdoor pond. Either the indoor pond is 
seasonal (for colder months), or the home is in a metropolitan 
area where an outdoor pond isn’t possible. Some koi-keepers 
have just one pond, in a screened-in pool cage or similar area, 
so that it’s both outdoors and indoors, but they live in areas 
where the daytime temperatures are always 70 degrees F or 
higher. There are, of course, a few areas where the weather 
makes it possible to have one pond, a pond that is both outside
and inside.
Outdoor ponds seem to have all the pluses:
 Koi are much easier to take care of outside.
 Their colors are brighter because of sunlight.
 The fish are healthier because they have more 
swimming room, vertically and horizontally.
Yet you can design an indoor pond to provide many of the good
points of an outdoor pond.

More than anything else, an indoor pond makes sense when 
it comes to your pocketbook. Taking care of koi in an outdoor 
pond during the winter is expensive. Although the cost of a 
cover and a heating system are one-time expenses, the utility 
costs aren’t.
In contrast, an indoor pond adds modestly to your utility costs. 
Of course, the cost of installing an indoor pond can go from 
affordable to extravagant, but for most koi-keepers in northern
states, the enjoyment is well worth the cost.
In this chapter, we discuss the do’s and don’ts and the ABCs 
of indoor koi-keeping. In addition to the questions of humidity,
equipment needs, and logistics, we guide you through the setup 
of your aquarium, water-quality issues, and the anticipated arrival
of your koi. Finally, we add our advice on potential problems: what
they look like, how to avoid them, and how to solve them if they 
do occur.
Addressing Humidity and 
Its Effect on Your Home
The first question we get regarding indoor ponds is usually,
“Doesn’t all the moisture from the indoor pond wreck your 
house?” Our answer: Absolutely not.
Instead of causing problems because of increased humidity, 
an indoor koi pond helps alleviate the wintertime dryness that
makes human noses and hands red and itchy. The moisture also
decreases the chance of you shuffling your feet across the carpet
and pulling a 2-inch static spark off the tip of your spouse’s nose
(which may or may not be a good thing!).
If you renovate a room for pond installation, avoid possible
damage by using water-resistant green board for the walls rather
than ordinary sheetrock. Concrete backer board (the material used
as an underlayment for ceramic tile) is even better if there’s a
chance that the water will come in contact with the walls.
However, adopt a zero-tolerance attitude toward any bit of 
moisture on the floor next to your pond. A small leak can cause 
a ghastly amount of damage, and leaks rarely stay small. (Our 
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
152

personal experience is that little leaks become big leaks on 
Sunday afternoons or immediately as you leave for a three-
day weekend.)
You can easily disperse the humidity that builds up in your 
pond room with ventilation. Note: An exhaust fan vented outside
or even to your attic isn’t a good idea if it’s 40 degrees outside
because you’re tossing heat out along with the moisture. Instead,
vent the fan into a hallway to help circulate the damp air through-
out the house.
You can also go slightly higher-tech and buy a home dehu-
midifier that can roll from one room to another. These units 
pull the moisture from the air; then once a day or so, you empty 
its water receptacle.
Plan C: You can just not worry about it. We don’t.
Planning Ahead for Your 
Indoor Spectacle
Designing and building an indoor koi pond isn’t all that different
from constructing an outside pond. You start by planning for the
largest pond that your space and budget will allow, figuring in the
size and potential size of your koi as part of the process.
Finding a container for an indoor pond is surprisingly easy. You
can use any of the following:
 A big aquarium (for baby koi)
 A show tank
 A stock tank
 A preformed pond
 A semi-permanent pond made from a liner and landscape 
timbers
 A permanent indoor pond
The costs increase in that order as well. Table 10-1 gives 
you a side-by-side comparison of each of the options that are 
suitable for adult koi. See the next section for info on using an
aquarium.

Considering the aquarium option
A large aquarium tank, 150 to 200 gallons, works as a winter won-
derland for a few baby koi up to 6 inches long. The problem is that
koi don’t stay small, so the fancy-schmancy aquarium with a heater
and filter and lights is only useful for a year before those cute baby
koi outgrow it.
But an aquarium buys you some time if you need temporary hous-
ing while you complete the inside pond. Be forewarned: You’ll put
about $400 into a big aquarium and all its accessories, none of
which will work in your inside koi pond.
Deciding on the setup type
As you decide which type of indoor pond best suits your needs,
give some thought to plumbing. Plan to plumb a drain line right
into the pond bottom or adjacent to the pond. Trust us on this:
Filling and draining the pond or backwashing the filter is a lot
easier if you’ve installed a drain in the setup process.
Figuring out how big to make it
The only concern you have regarding the size of your indoor pond
and your koi is the fish load, meaning how many inches of koi will
fit comfortably into the new pond. Simply put, the pond must be
big enough to provide swimming room for the koi.
In planning your indoor pond, the minimum depth of 4 feet is a
given. So, to figure out how many koi you can adequately house,
and how large a space you’ll actually need around any pond, start
with some basic numbers and work outward, using the compro-
mise standard of an inch-and-a-half of koi per square foot of sur-
face area:
1. Start out with the smallest possible pond. A small pond
measuring 6 feet x 4 feet (and 4 feet deep, at least) can
house 36 inches of koi.
2. Adjust the measurements a bit to see how many more
inches of koi you can add with that tweak. For example,
bump up the measurements by just 1 foot along one side, and
you have a 6-x-5-foot pond that can house 45 inches of koi.
Because your indoor pond will probably be smaller than your 
outdoor pond, putting all those koi into a smaller pond is going to
send the ammonia and nitrite readings through the roof (read that:
Chapter 10: Keeping Koi Inside 155

your fish will quickly become stressed and die). Consider the wise
words of Dolly Parton, who once said that you can’t put 10 pounds
of potatoes in a 5-pound sack. Either accept that you will be keep-
ing fewer fish than would be possible in a large, outdoor pond, or
make plans now to redistribute some of your koi to pond stores or
other hobbyists before the cold season sets in.
Although koi lovers sometimes don’t have the space to accommo-
date their koi-keeping habit and may feel a bit self-conscious about
the small size of their inside pond, you needn’t be one of them.
Take a deep breath — you can overcome that small-inside-pond
syndrome. If you are in the fortunate position of having unlimited
time and money, as well as a place to live during construction, you
can follow the example of those unusually dedicated (extreme?)
koi owners:
 Some such folks add on an outside pond and then increase
the size of the house to encompass the pond.
 Other owners start with a pond and then build their house
around the pond.
 Realistically, however, most people just find a corner in the
den or the mudroom and build an indoor pond there.
Buying the necessary indoor 
pond equipment
The decision to create an indoor pond and the process of doing 
so involves many of the same issues that face those seeking to
establish an outdoor pond. If you are new to pond keeping, please
read Chapters 6 through 9 before embarking on a plan to build an
indoor pond.
If you already have an outdoor pond, you probably have much 
of the smaller equipment you need for an indoor pond. Just bring
your koi nets, sock nets, koi bowl, water-testing kit(s), and the koi
wheat germ diet inside. The nets and the bowl can be stored on
hooks on a wall adjacent to the pond, and the rest fits inside a 
plastic outdoor storage unit that you bring inside for the season.
Or you can do what most koi-keepers do: Clean out the guest coat
closet for your koi supplies. When company comes, toss their
coats on your bed. Because many of your friends are going to 
be koi-keepers as well, they’ll understand perfectly.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
156

Discarding the crud: Filters
This is not the time to skimp on filters. Many kinds of biofilters are
out there, all produced by different companies, but be as careful in
the selection of this biofilter as you are for your pond.
You’re best off biting the bullet and buying a three-chambered filter
or a bead filter for your indoor pond. (For more info on these two
types of filters, flip back to Chapter 6.) One area you can actually
save money in is on a UV sterilizer; you probably won’t need one
for an indoor pond.
A submerged filter can’t handle what your koi dish out, so don’t
even think about buying one. Also, don’t buy a canister that prom-
ises to handle mechanical and biological filtration if it only has a
couple of small filter pads and a double-handful of bio-balls. These
small pond biofilters may be okay for water-lily ponds, but koi sure
aren’t lilies when it comes to producing debris.
Getting the water to go through the filter: Water pumps
Pump designers choose between cheap, easy-to-produce pumps
and pumps where efficient design is more important than produc-
tion cost. So, you’re not likely to find a cheap pump that is also
very effective. As water quality and overall clarity is especially
important in indoor situations, we suggest that you do not skimp
on costs when choosing a pump.
An important factor in pumps is the power requirement. Sort your
top choices for a pump by amperage. Ignore the pumps on the high
end of amperage use (any that use more than 8 amps) because they
literally drink electricity (note that we did not say sip). If a kilowatt-
hour in your area costs a dime (what a deal you’re getting!), you can
multiply $100 times the number of your pump’s amps to guesstimate
its annual cost to run. For instance, a water pump that uses 12 amps
costs about $1,200 a year to run, or about $100 dollars a month.
Of course, the cost of a high-amperage pump (12 or 13 amps — and
yes, you should flinch when you hear those words) is a bit cheaper
upfront (about $800) than a lower-amp pump. A pump that needs
only half the amps may have an initial cost of $1,400, but it’ll cost
you a lot less to run (multiply 6 by $100 and divide by 12 to get your
monthly expense of $50). When you’re writing out a check to your
local utility each month, the thought of saving $50 because you
bought the right kind of water pump can be very appealing. In just
one year you’ll make up the difference of the more expensive unit
($1,400 – $800 = $600 ÷ 12 = $50).
Chapter 10: Keeping Koi Inside 157

The size of your pump will determine its ability to clean and 
oxygenate the water. Look for a water pump that can move 
your pond’s volume through the filter about every two hours.
Giving your koi some oxygen: Air pumps
The smaller surface area of inside koi ponds means lower gas
exchange. When you add in the chance for overcrowding, your 
koi are going to need some help.
Solve the problem by putting in an air pump and an airstone. Two
benefits from higher levels of oxygen are
 The fish will be able to breathe naturally, that is, without gulp-
ing for air at the surface. They will, therefore, be more likely to
remain healthy and behave normally.
 The friendly bacteria in your biofilter work more efficiently.
Position the airstone in front of the filter return so the oxygen-laden
air gets pushed around the pond (and you get more oomph for your
airstone buck).
Look for an air pump that can deliver at least 1 cubic foot per minute
through 1⁄4-inch or 3⁄16-inch tubing. This flow will operate a 12-inch air-
stone or two 6-inch airstones, enough for most indoor ponds. When
you buy the air pump, buy the tubing and a manifold at the same
time so you can put more than one airstone on a single air pump.
Because this pond is indoors, you don’t need to worry about
weatherproof housing for the air pump. An indoor air pump that
can pump a cubic foot a minute costs about $100, and a metal man-
ifold costs about $70. Expect the pump to last about two years.
Bringing your koi out from the dark: Lighting
Light quality is an important but often overlooked consideration 
in the design of indoor koi environments. Although koi do not
absolutely require full spectrum light, the subtleties of their colors
are certainly shown to best advantage under it. The fish also seem
to be more active under such naturalistic lighting — perhaps full
spectrum light may someday be shown to confer health benefits 
to koi, as is the case for many reptiles. In any event, your viewing
pleasure and the appearance of your home will be enhanced if you
choose your pond’s lighting wisely.
It is recommended that you add banks of full spectrum fluorescent
plant bulbs over your pond, but that can be pretty bright, and the
shop-type fixtures are better suited to a garage workbench than
your pond room.
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
158

Some koi keepers install a wall of glass blocks or large double-
paned glass windows next to the pond and add insulated drapes
for cold days and nights. But when the drapes are closed on cold
days, you need additional lighting.
Incandescent bulbs that give off UVA and UVB light are available
from reptile dealers and some pet shops. Although they look like
sunlamp bulbs, these UVA/UVB lights are made from clear glass.
And because they’re so bright, you need to place them in reflectors
(metal units that hold the bulbs) so the light is directed down into
the pond. (Reflectors are available where you buy the bulbs.)
Place the UVA/UVB bulbs on one end of your indoor pond. They
not only light up the whole pond but also provide the kind of light-
ing that encourages plant growth (please note that some bulbs
sold as “plant bulbs” do not emit sufficient UVA/UVB — check that
the label specifically notes UVA/UVB emission).
Koi may be startled by light suddenly flooding a dark room, so be
sure to turn on the room lights first, then the pond lights. A timer
can be used to keep the lights on a fixed schedule — 10 to 12 hours
of light per day works well. A timer can also be used to program a
small lamp or room light to come on a half hour or so before the
pond light and to stay on a half hour after they go off. This will pro-
vide a “dawn/dusk” period, and will eliminate the risk of stressing
the fish. If you plan on breeding your koi, you should use a light
timer to mimic local seasonal fluctuations, such as short winter
days that lengthen as spring approaches.
Incidentally, koi look gorgeous in full spectrum light.
Getting Down to Business: Setting
Up Your Indoor Pond
The initial stages of planning your indoor pond are as important as
the actual physical process. Maintaining koi indoors can be a time-
consuming and expensive prospect, and mistakes made early on
will be compounded over time and difficult (and expensive) to 
correct. Therefore, read and plan carefully at this stage so that 
you have a thorough understanding of all that is involved before
you actually get your hands wet (pun intended).
In case you’re a bit wary, take it from us that setting up an inside koi
pond is actually easier than it sounds. Whether you go for a perma-
nent or a temporary pond, you’ll find working on a smaller scale fun
because everything is so reachable; the filter is just around the
Chapter 10: Keeping Koi Inside 159

edge of the pond, and the bottom of the pond is just 4 feet down —
you could reach in with a fine fish net or siphon to pick up any dirt.
But first, the easiest setup of all: the aquarium.
Starting out simple with an aquarium
An aquarium is the least expensive way to keep koi indoors and is,
on the surface, a simpler route to follow than is pool construction.
We say “on the surface” because there are some potential pitfalls
that you must consider. As mentioned in the “Considering the
aquarium option” section, koi will quickly outgrow most aquari-
ums, so you must either plan for an eventual larger enclosure or
resign yourself to finding new homes for your pets at some point.
Also, because tanks are smaller than ponds, any mistakes that you
make in terms of water chemistry (allowing ammonia levels to rise,
for example) will be magnified and more serious than they would
be in a large pond. Therefore, always purchase the largest tank that
your space and budget allow (although you can keep small koi in a
55-gallon tank for a short period of time, a 100- to 200-gallon tank is
really the smallest that you should consider).
Location
Deciding where to put your aquarium is an important decision 
that is usually made based on available space within the home.
However, you need to consider several other important factors,
especially the weight of the tank. When filled with water, a 100-
gallon aquarium with its associated equipment approaches 1,000
pounds in weight. The floor on which it rests must, therefore, be
strong enough to support it over time. Ideally, the tank should be
located over support beams. If you have any doubts in this regard,
consult an architect.
If you plan to place your aquarium on a stand, you should purchase
one with adjustable legs. This allows you to compensate for uneven
spots in the floor. The stand’s surface should be smooth and free of
bumps as even tiny irregularities can cause stress fractures and
leaks in the aquarium over time. A cork or foam sheet placed on 
top of the stand is an important added safety measure. You may
also wish to purchase appropriate home or renter’s insurance, 
just in case a leak does occur.
Although sunlight through a window may add to your viewing
pleasure, be aware that such light can affect water temperatures
and stimulate the rapid growth of algae. Keep in mind also that koi
can detect sound via water vibrations, and so may be stressed by
loud stereos and televisions. “Busy” rooms with slamming doors
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
160

are best avoided as well. The noise concerns go both ways, so
don’t locate the aquarium where the sound of the pump’s motor 
or of flowing water will disturb you or others.
Your tank should be placed near a source of electricity. Ideally, 
the socket should be off to one side and out of the range of spilled
water. If, as is likely, a floor drain is not available, you will need to
run a siphon hose out a door or into a toilet (don’t use sinks where
food is prepared) when doing water changes and other routine
maintenance. You also need to consider a source for fresh water
and space for your filter and pump.
The pump and filter
A wide variety of pumps and filters are suitable for use with koi
aquariums. These are rated by the size of the aquarium that can 
be filtered (be sure to read the product information carefully or
consult a knowledgeable retailer). In choosing one, it is better to
go with a model on the stronger end of the scale, because koi pro-
duce a good deal of waste and will easily overwhelm an undersized
system. Of course, don’t go overboard and buy a unit that is far too
powerful for your tank, or the currents generated may interfere
with the fish’s ability to swim.
Please see Chapter 5 for a list of basic supplies that you will need
to have on hand.
Setting up a preformed pond
A preformed pond may be the easiest way to add an indoor pond.
There are a few drawbacks, however. Normally, preformed ponds
are buried in the ground, and the surrounding dirt helps the pond
support the weight of the water.
If your pond isn’t strong enough to be self-standing when filled,
you’ll need to find a way to support the pond, which means build-
ing a wooden box around the pond that is strong enough to sup-
port the weight of the water-filled pond.
If the preformed pond has a bottom drain, you’ll need to raise 
the pond high enough to hook up the drain to the water pump.
Most koi-keepers just reinforce the area under the raised pond
with 2-x-4s but leave an access area to the drain open. The air
pump will feed air out through the top of the drain, or you can
attach the air pump hose to an airstone and drape the hose over
the edge of the pond.
Chapter 10: Keeping Koi Inside 161

If your pond doesn’t have a drain in the bottom, you have two 
easy options:
 Buy an add-on bottom drain. Tetra makes a vacuum attach-
ment (the rest of the koi world calls it an add-on bottom drain)
for $45. It rests on the bottom of the pond, looking a bit like
the vacuum wand for your canister vacuum. It hooks up to
your water pump with a length of 2-inch flex hose (about $2.25
per foot not including any fittings).
 Drape your pump intake and filter outflow pipes over the
edge of the pond. This approach is simpler than adding a
drain, but it isn’t so pretty. Add a prefilter (a foam filter-intake
cover) to avoid catching one of your koi in the intake hose.
Figure 10-1 shows the various components of an indoor 
preformed pond.
Figure 10-1: An indoor pond setup.
Building and setting up a 
timber-and-liner pond
Landscape timers and a liner make for an easy-to-assemble, easy-to-
take-down pond. You simply buy enough timbers to make the pond
as high as you want it; four timbers, stacked atop each other, are a
foot high, so each side of a 4-foot-high pond will need 16 timbers.

Constructing the pond
Landscape timbers are 3 inches high, 4 inches wide, and 8 feet long.
If you make your pond 8 feet square, you won’t have to cut any 
timbers. You simply fasten the stacked timbers together with 4-foot
lengths of rebar, inserted through holes you drill in the timber.
You’ll need three lengths of rebar per side, one for each end of 
the time, and one in the center, for a total of 12 4-foot lengths.
1. Using a 7/8 drill bit and an 8-foot length of 1 x 4, drill
holes in the timber, 2 inches, 6 inches, 44 inches, and 48
inches from one end. Drill a fifth hole 2 inches from the
far end.
This piece of timber will serve as a template, so you can
drill all the timbers and the holes will match up.
2. Use the template to drill these holes in every timber.
3. Lay the first course of timbers in a square, so the end of
one piece abuts the side of the piece next to it.
4. Add the second layer of timbers so the corners are inter-
locked, like a log cabin.
5. Repeat the layers, making certain the corners overlap.
6. When your layers are about a foot high, insert the rebar
into the timbers so they are locked together, then continue
to place the timbers, threading them onto the rebar.
There will be rebar at each end, and one near the center.
7. Continue the courses until your pond is just one layer
short of 4 feet high.
Installing the drain line
Ask your local plumber to install a drain, unless your skills extend
to modest plumbing. The drain can be as simple as the drain in
your laundry room — a 3-inch PVC pipe, covered at floor level with
a removable metal grate and leading to your back or side yard. You
will use this drain when you flush, clean, or drain your pond, and
when you backwash your filter. To get rid of the backwash, simply
attach a 2-inch flexible hose to the backwash drain, stick the other
end down into the drain, and open the filter’s valve.
Backwash is loaded with nutrients, and it’s a good fertilizer. But if
there’s salt in the water, you may not want it on your lawn; for this
reason and perhaps for local regulations, your plumber may rec-
ommend the drain be tied into your sewage line.
Chapter 10: Keeping Koi Inside 163

Incidentally, an indoor pond can be a good place to use your filter
outflow for a small waterfall if you can position it so any splashing
is kept within the pond. This added attraction also helps aerate the
water.
Adding the filter intake and outflow
Now you need to place your filter and your water pump near the
pond and hook them up. You need three sections of PVC or flexible
swimming pool hose, 2 inches in diameter, or whatever size your
filter and water pump take. If you use PVC, be prepared to cut it
and add PVC preformed joints as needed.
You need one piece of hose or PVC pipe long enough to reach 
from the bottom drain to the water pump, one long enough to go
between the water pump and the filter, and the third long enough
to reach from the filter over the side of the pond and down into the
pond. Follow the manufacturer’s directions on securing the hose or
PVC pipe to the various components.
1. Check your filter to make certain the filter media is in
place, and move the filter to the site you’ve chosen next
to the pond.
2. Place your water pump adjacent to the filter.
3. Attach the intake hose/PVC pipe from the bottom drain to
the water pump.
4. Attach the hose between the water pump and the filter.
5. Attach the filter outflow hose to the filter, and place the
free end of the hose down into the pond.
When you set up your indoor filter, some koi-keepers recommend
replacing some of the new filter media with media from your outside
pond and filling the filter tank with water from your outside pond.
This step helps to establish the nitrifying (beneficial) bacteria in the
filter. But beware: Using media and water from your outdoor pond
also delivers any pathogens from that pond to your indoor pond. If
you have any concerns about this, purchase a culture of nitrifying
bacteria from your pond or pet store.
Adding the liner and water
If you’ve gone through the preceding sections, you’re now ready
for the final, glorious step: adding the liner and the water.
1. Drape the liner into the pond, being careful to hold the
corners neatly, and bring the upper edges out over the
Part II: Living with Koi, Inside and Out 
164

top landscape timber. You can cut slits in the top edge of
the liner to make it fit around the rebar.
2. Staple the liner onto the top of the timbers.
3. Thread the final landscape layer over the rebar to 
conceal the liner edge.
4. Add water.
With this style of indoor pond, it’s important that the water in the
pond not come into contact with the treated landscape timbers.
Keep the level of the water in the pond at least 4 inches below the
top edge of the liner.
A good way to settle your indoor pond water is to put a few goldfish
or inexpensive (read ugly) koi into your indoor pond a few weeks
before the other koi. These trial fish will, by their behavior and
adjustment (or nonadjustment!), bring to light any water-quality
problems and will help feed the beneficial bacteria and mature 
your indoor pond water naturally.
Monitoring Water Quality
The drawback of indoor ponds is, of course, the size. This smaller
pond system is chemically far more fragile than an outdoor pond. If
you have an outdoor pond and think you’ve been very careful with
your water readings this summer, ramp it up a notch. You have to
be twice as vigilant and twice as concerned about small chemical
changes in your indoor pond because the impact of these will be
magnified in the reduced water volume.
Your vigilance on the indoor pond’s water chemistry takes two 
factors into consideration:
 This new pond will have all the typical new-pond problems.
Don’t think you’re getting away from them just because you’re
a seasoned pro with outdoor ponds.
 Your old nitrite-gobbling friend, algae, isn’t going to grow on
the walls of an indoor pond the way it does on an outdoor
pond. Indoor ponds don’t get enough sunlight for algae, so
you may need to use a product like AmQuel Plus (the plus is
important) to reduce nitrite levels.
Do the following to transition to a chemically balanced pond
(please see Chapter 9 for details):
Chapter 10: Keeping Koi Inside 165

 Test your indoor pond for ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, and pH
at least weekly or until the readings level out.
 Partially change the water (10 percent) every week to lower
the ammonia and nitrite levels until the water chemistry 
settles down.
 Use a product like AmQuel Plus to remove nitrites.
Check out Table 10-2 for the correct chemistry levels for your
indoor pond.
One of the simplest but most important ways to maintain 
your indoor pond’s water quality is by not overfeeding. Koi, 
poor things, have no stomach. Their throat leads directly to 
their gut, so they have very little pause time, if you understand,
between feeding and output. Koi don’t need a great deal of food,
and they can fast without bad results for a month or more. 
Bottom line: Feeding lightly is a good idea for the water quality 
of an indoor pond.

Adding the Finishing Touch:
Releasing the Koi
You can add koi to your indoor pond after you’ve
 Filled, drained, and refilled the pond
 Treated the water for chlorine and chloramines
 Checked the pH level and temperature to make sure your fish
won’t undergo drastic pH or temperature changes
You may not want to put your prize Bekko in at this point. Instead,
test drive your indoor pond by putting in a few goldfish (if you
haven’t already included them to help mature the water) or a few
koi for a day or two and watch for any obvious signs of distress.
Before you add all of your koi, double-check those koi-load factors to
be sure that your pond and its filtration system can support the fish
you plan to keep in it (see Chapter 3). Then add your koi and call
your koi friends to come over and admire your new indoor pond.
How to Tell When Something’s
Wrong (And How to Fix It)
No matter how much you read, plan, and prepare, problems will
inevitably arise. You can prevent problems from becoming disas-
ters by being alert and detecting them early, and by knowing what
steps to take. The following hints will help you recognize and deal
with the most commonly encountered difficulties.
 Closely observe the fish. Are they gasping at the surface of
the water? Are they staying near the surface and not ventur-
ing down into the bottom of the pond?
 Check your water chemistry values, especially for ammonia
or nitrite levels. A partial water change may help deal with
the problem temporarily, but if the values go up again, you
need to identify the cause and deal with it.
 Check your dissolved oxygen levels. Are they at least 5 mil-
ligrams per liter? You can increase the oxygen levels by using
a small waterfall or one or two airstones.
Can the problem be (gasp!) too many fish? Maybe the answer
is a bigger indoor pond.
Chapter 10: Keeping Koi Inside 167

 Check your pond for leaks. The sooner you know about a
leak, the better. You can buy a battery-operated leak detector
(Skylink WA 318 is one) that consists of a sensor and a receiver
for about $25. You place the sensor on the floor near the pond.
When water touches electrodes on the bottom of the sensor,
the sensor sets off a chime and a flashing light in the house-
hold receiver. The receiver can be located up to 300 feet away
from the pond.
Prepare for the what-if of a pond leak. You may never need it,
but thinking out a procedure ahead of time can save you time
and headaches.
If you can’t self-diagnose your pond problem, call an experienced
koi-keeper to look at your setup and your fish. He may be able to
see something that you don’t — and it’s a good way to find out
more about your fish at the same time.
In the case of a total pond meltdown, your koi need help fast, and
that likely means a koi buddy to the rescue. Friends like this arrive
in the middle of the night with loaner show tanks or stock tanks, or
they help you scoop your koi up and take them home to their own
quarantine tubs, or they fill your bathtubs, dechlor that water, and
move the survivors. They’ll even call around and see who has
room for what. There is no substitute for koi buddies. Lacking
them, you should keep empty stock tanks or inexpensive plastic
wading pools on hand. Be sure to have enough extra liquid dechlo-
rinator to treat the water that you’ll be adding to these enclosures.
Other supplies you’ll need just in case include
 A wet/dry shop vacuum (Although the biggest versions can
handle only about 10 gallons before you have to dump out the
water, they take the water off the floor faster than you can mop.)
 A dozen rolls of paper towels
 One or two buckets
 Big sponges
 A mop

Just like people, koi like to eat. And very much like people, they
cheerfully consume diets high in fat or crammed with carbohy-
drates without a real concern for how they pan out in the long run
(or long swim, as the case may be). Some foods that koi love to eat,
like white bread and cooked rice, provide carbohydrates but not
full nutrition, and the koi tend to load on weight with no real nutri-
tional benefit.
The good news is that you can provide a healthful diet through
commercial foods, and you don’t have to pick up a single earth-
worm or cook up a batch of greens unless you want to. In this
chapter, we tell you what koi need to eat, how to find commercial
fish foods to fill those dietary requirements, and how you can sup-
plement those commercial foods with foods from your garden or
grocery store. We even tell you how to make your own koi food
cakes (if you feel like cooking!).
Eating Right: It’s All about Variety
No single food item provides total nutrition for koi, which is why a
variety of food items is so important. Whether the food items are
fresh (fresh from the ground, fresh from the sea, fresh from the
field) or part of a dried or frozen commercial mix doesn’t seem to
matter. The important factor is the mix of ingredients.

Ideally, a wide variety of plant- and animal-based foods should be
provided. The specifics of the koi’s natural diet are not completely
known and vary from location to location throughout their enor-
mous range. Commercial diets also vary in their ingredients,
including such diverse items as fish meal (made from 4–5 species),
shrimp meal, krill, dried insects, corn, wheat, soybeans, rose hips,
spirulina, oats, rice, and alfalfa. By combining these foods with var-
ious vitamins and minerals, several formulas have been devised
that provide all the nutrients needed by captive koi. You can, of
course, furnish a wholly fresh diet to your koi (and have no life
other than koi-feeding), or, like serious koi-keepers, you can take
advantage of high-quality commercial koi diets.
Making the Best Commercial 
Food Choices
Koi-food companies have spent years and hundreds of thousands
of dollars to develop diets that appeal to koi and still offer com-
plete nutrition in a packaged, dry form. But how can you tell
whether the food you’re buying is really a complete diet? Do 
federal standards exist like the ones for baby food?
Like cuts of meat, generally speaking, you get what you pay for
with koi food. So, the not-so-good commercial brands exist along-
side the good commercial brands and the very good commercial
feeds. How can you tell which is which? Stick with us, dear reader;
we walk you through it in this section.
Koi-food manufacturers spend a lot of money on package design
because they want to catch your eye. If the label’s attractive, it
helps entice you, the consumer, into picking the container up —
and that’s half the battle. An attractive package can also entice you
to spend more than you planned and distract you from your real
goal, which is to buy good nutrition for your koi.
What to look for in koi food
When you’re purchasing koi food, size matters. Look for pellets
that are keyed to the size of your koi. Young koi (4 inches or less)
need a pellet small enough to eat right away, so they don’t have to
wait for it to fall apart. Look for pellets about one-eighth inch
across for small koi. Quarter-inch pellets are fine for adult koi.
When you’re sure you’re looking at the right size of food, you still
have some choices to make, and it’s easy to get confused.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
172

Basically, you want to pay attention to the variety of ingredients
and to the levels of vitamins, minerals, protein, and fat. To narrow
down your choices, read the contents list on the container to
ensure that these important nutrients are at appropriate levels (as
described later in this chapter), and that the food draws its ingre-
dients from varying sources.
Some details to note about koi food products:
 The list can include vitamins and items as common as ground
corn and as arcane as rose hips. Specifics as to the actual
value of each may be lacking, but experience has shown that
such foods are good for koi and readily accepted by them.
 Some ingredients can meet more than one nutritional guide-
line. (For instance, wheat germ can provide vitamins, protein,
and carbohydrates, and oils can provide energy and vitamins.)
Koi nutrition is not an exact science, so don’t worry about
ingredients that seem to overlap. Reputable companies use
formulas that have, over time, been shown to provide koi with
fairly complete nutrition.
Koi are pretty simple creatures, so you don’t need to buy 18 kinds of
koi food and still wonder about the nutritional value. You just need
to stick with diets that meet the guidelines set out here and add a
few of the extra items that we will discuss in the following pages.
The following sections lay out the essentials for your koi’s diet.
Protein
Protein is one of the most important contents because fish need it
for energy, growth, and tissue repair.
The best sources of protein in a koi diet are fish meal and soy-
beans. Animal protein (from chicken for example) is not as
digestible. Fish sources may include whitefish meal, anchovy meal,
herring meal, and shrimp meal.
The protein content may be 25 to 36 percent of your koi’s diet,
depending on the season and the age of your koi. Consider the fol-
lowing information as a guide:
 During the summer: Protein should be 30 to 36 percent of the
diet when the energy needs of your koi are higher (during the
active summer months).
 During the winter: Protein should be nearer 25 percent of the
diet when koi are less active and their metabolism slows (in
the fall and early winter). In southern states where the
Chapter 11: Koi Nutrition 101 173

weather remains warm, your fish will not enter a dormant
stage, so plan to feed them a higher protein diet year-round.
 When they’re young (under 3 years of age): Protein should
be 30 to 36 percent of the diet.
Look for a food that lists protein first on the ingredients label. (All
manufacturers list contents from highest to lowest according to
their dry-weight quantity.)
If you prefer to stay on the middle ground and not veer into high or
low protein levels, buy plant-derived protein sources, like wheat
germ pellets. These sources generally provide enough protein (and
they’re a good source of vitamin E). You can give these to your koi
throughout the year, but they are especially important during the
cooler seasons.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are another energy source. They’re also good
sources of fiber and a main component of vegetables and fruit.
(See the later section on fiber for more info on fiber in the koi diet.)
If koi don’t have carbs for easy-to-obtain energy, your koi break
down protein instead, which leads to a vastly increased output of
ammonia. However, you need to strike the right balance because
too many carbs can lead to chubby koi. The correct amount is not
firmly established, but 60 to 70 percent is safe. Suitable sources for
carbs are plant-based foods such as wheat, corn, soybeans, and
rose hips.
Lipids
Oils and fats (or simply lipids) are another source of energy and a
good source of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K. Koi derive
lipids from animal-based foods such as fish meal and shrimp meal,
as well as from fish oil and wheat germ oil.
An ideal koi diet consists of 3 to 10 percent fat. The high end is for
fast-growing young fish, and the low end is for adult fish. The fat
content of the diet should come from easily digested sources, such
as wheat germ, during the colder months when the fish’s metabo-
lisms are operating at a reduced pace.
Vitamins and minerals
Vitamins and minerals are important components of a koi diet (as
they are for any living organism). Little is known of the exact levels
required by koi, but those included in long-established commercial
foods can be trusted.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
174

Fiber
Fiber is the vehicle that carries the food components through the
digestive system where they are then absorbed. The longer the
food’s in the gut (within limits, of course), the more time the fish
has to absorb the nutrients. This is obviously the advantage to fiber
in the diet. However, the less fiber, the less bulk in the excreted
feces, which is important when you’re raising koi in fairly high num-
bers because less bulk means less strain on your filtration system.
In practice, however, your best option is not to attempt to regulate
feces composition via diet. Rather, feed a standard commercial diet
and use adequate filtration for the number of koi you have. If you
feel you must reduce the volume of the feces that your fish pro-
duce, use a lower-fiber food, such as wheat germ pellets, as the
main portion of their diet.
Good sources of fiber are ground corn, oats, wheat germ, and simi-
lar plant-based foods. The fiber provided by these generally makes
up about 5 percent of commercial diets, which seems to be an ade-
quate level. Fiber content should, like other foods, be reduced in
the cooler months. Recommended winter foods such as wheat
germ pellets have a fiber content of 2 to 3 percent.
Sinking versus floating food
Koi foods are either floating or sinking. Sinking foods do just that,
making them seem like a good choice for fish that are usually
bottom feeders (fish that swim along the bottom of a pond or
stream, taking up mouthfuls of this and that and spitting out what
doesn’t taste like food). But pond koi are another matter entirely.
Because display-quality koi can cost hundred of dollars, you most
likely want to see these living jewels. So, feeding your fish floating
food simply increases your opportunity to enjoy your treasure
chest. Floating food is also practical for three reasons:
 It helps you keep track of how much food you actually drop
into your pond.
 The food disperses over the surface of your pond, giving each
fish a chance to feed.
 It gives you a chance to interact with your fish, to see who’s
feeding and who isn’t, and to check out who may have scale
or other health issues (see Chapter 13 for info on what to do
about health and scale problems).
Because koi fry understand from day one that food comes from the
sky and stays on the pond surface, your koi already know how to eat
a floating commercial diet. Koi just out of the egg are often brought
up on flake food by the breeder and then graduate to floating pellets.
Chapter 11: Koi Nutrition 101 175

In fall, when the pond waters cool, we suggest you use sinking pel-
lets. Koi are less active in cooler water, so the sinking pellets are
easier for the koi to feed on. Just don’t go overboard in quantity
because your fish won’t be nearly as hungry as they were in the
warmer months. (We talk about seasonal feedings and food quanti-
ties later in this chapter.)
When you use sinking pellets, broadcast them over the surface of
the pond so they’re dispersed as they sink. The quantity is the
same as for floating pellets.
Adding Some Simple 
(And Lively) Treats
Although the commercial diets provide good nutrition to your koi,
you can offer snack foods in limited quantities from your grocer,
your garden, or your local bait store that your koi will obviously
enjoy. If you feed treats daily, reduce the amount of commercial
food. Feeding a diet composed entirely of fresh foods is not recom-
mended because it’s extremely difficult to provide the dietary vari-
ety necessary for good health.
Try these as treats in spring or summer:
 Romaine lettuce: Cut the head into quarters and toss them
into the water. It may take a while, but your koi put their lips
and mouths to good use as they shred and devour the lettuce.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
176
Does this stuff ever go bad?
Don’t rely on the old sniff test to see whether your koi food is still good. You can’t
really tell whether it’s gone rancid because they all smell pretty bad even when you
open them!
Although few fish foods are dated, try to buy a quantity you can use within four
months. Also, buy from a store that has a high turnover rate so you’re not buying
food that’s been on the shelf for a couple of months. Some brands actually have use
by dates on the package, which makes it easier to tell whether the product is fresh.
If you want to be extra-cautious (because you’re new to koi-keeping or have some
very expensive koi in your pond), you may want to store the open container in your
refrigerator to slow down deterioration. Some koi-keepers buy a six-month supply,
decant a month’s worth into a container, put the rest in freezer bags, and store the
bags in their freezer until needed.

 Oranges: Slice a whole orange into six sections, but leave the
skin on. Your koi can slurp out the pulp. If you want to pro-
long the process, cut across the orange to create floating
orange slices. You’ll see a bobbing-for-apples action, only in
reverse.
 Earthworms: Toss these into the pond, one at a time, and
watch what happens when your koi discover them. This is
one of the best natural foods you can provide, and even if you
overfeed, it doesn’t affect the water quality.
Earthworms are especially useful as a conditioning food
before spawning or as an end-of-winter appetite wakeup. You
can dig these from your garden — maybe — or you can buy
them from bait stores. We buy ours by the 500-lot from a 
mail-order fishing supply company and store them in our
refrigerator.
 Live crayfish: When you toss a few live crayfish into the pond,
you’ll be reminded of the koi’s closeness to their wild brethren,
the carp.
 Freshwater glass shrimp (also called grass shrimp): Add a
half cup to your pond and watch your koi take on the treat.
Note: Other people feed live tadpoles, but we like tadpoles too
much to feed them to our koi.
Live foods are only an addition to the commercial diet. They don’t
offer a nutritional diet by themselves (and they’re too expensive to
be a steady diet anyway).
Avoiding Foods that Do No Good
Koi have extremely hearty appetites, and it therefore comes as no
surprise that they will consume foods that are not necessarily
good for them. The foods discussed in this section are tempting to
use because they are quite easy to come by and relished by koi.
However, they serve little purpose in the diet and should be
avoided.
Most of us can remember going to a goldfish or koi pond sometime
in the not-so-distant past and maybe tossing cubes of white bread
to the gaping mouths. White bread provides very little nutrition
and lots of carbohydrates — not good for your koi.
Whole meal bread is slightly better than white bread, but it may
cause eye protrusion (exophthalmia), an ugly sight and one that
can leave even experienced koi-keepers clueless as to the cause.
Chapter 11: Koi Nutrition 101 177

Trout pellets are another food to avoid — some people are
tempted to feed them to koi because they’re cheap and large.
These pellets are a high-protein food designed for rapid growth in
trout. You want your koi to grow at normal rates so they become
well shaped as opposed to bloated.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
178
Making your own koi cakes
Adult or subadult koi (8 inches or longer) may benefit from a home-cooked meal, or
rather, koi cubes. These will provide a variety of fresh ingredients not usually found
in commercial diets. In addition to being a welcome change of pace for your koi,
the cubes are another way of introducing variety into the diet. The following is the
recipe for this delicacy:
1. Chop each of the following ingredients separately in a food processor or a
chopper (we use a small electric chopper).
10 ounces frozen, chopped collard greens
5 ounces frozen green peas
5 ounces whitefish or imitation crab meat
1⁄2 green pepper, chopped
1 tablespoon each: freeze-dried tubifex worms (available at any pet store),
wheat germ
1 teaspoon montmolinite
2. Combine all ingredients and then puree them.
3. Add the pureed ingredients from Step 2 to 21⁄2 cups of cold water. Mix well.
4. Combine the following ingredients in a separate bowl and mix well:
1 teaspoon liquid vitamins, like you’d buy in a pet store
8 packages unflavored gelatin
21⁄2 cups boiling water
5. Stir the hot mix into the cold mix.
6. Spray mini ice-cube trays or mini muffin tins with an aerosol oil spray, fill with
the final collard mixture, and freeze.
The frozen cubes will thaw rapidly when you put them into the pond and can be
used as a replacement for the usual diet on a random basis. Feed as you would
other food — as much as the fish will consume in 5 minutes or so.

Supplying Supplements
Koi-food sales are big business, and the food manufacturer who
can make a convincing case for food supplements is richer than
one who can’t. Some manufacturers promote rapid growth or
brighter colors, while others push the concept of treats for special
occasions, in celebration of an event, or as a reward.
Do your koi need these supplements? You can answer this ques-
tion yourself. You know if you’re raising fry, or if your brightly col-
ored koi could benefit from a color supplement (see the nearby
sidebar, “Color-enhancing diets”).
Do koi need treats? Probably not. Koi don’t need to be motivated
the way humans do. On the other fin, maybe offering treats makes
you feel as if you’re providing a better diet or a more interesting
life to your fish. Or maybe offering these food items results in more
time and interaction with your fish. If so, go ahead. But like the
labels say, offer these foods in moderation, as an occasional treat.
Chapter 11: Koi Nutrition 101 179
Color-enhancing diets
Color-enhancing diets are foods with supplements — like carotene (the stuff that
makes carrots orange and flamingo feathers pink) or spirulina (green algae that
boost red and yellow coloration). People like to feed these enhancers because they
think their fish will be brighter and hence easier to spot in the pond.
Both of these additives enhance red coloration. If you select a food with spirulina,
remember that most koi-keepers only give their koi spirulina supplements in
September because this plant-based food is readily digested when the water tem-
perature drops. (Don’t feed it when the pond temperature drops below 40 degrees F
because your koi won’t feed at such temperatures.) Just to confuse the issue, other
keepers use spirulina to brighten up their koi a month before they enter their koi in
a show.
Although brighter fish colors may sound attractive, think for a moment about 
your fish before you go that route. Color enhancers add a pink blush to a koi’s white
skin — not what you want, for instance, when you’ve spent big bucks for a Shiro
Bekko, a black and white koi. On the other hand, if your prize koi are all Hi Utsuri
(red and black koi), feeding a color enhancer may turn those fish into knockouts.
Use color enhancers just once daily.

Feeding Koi through the Seasons
One of the charms of the koi pond is that you don’t have to feed
the koi year-round. Koi stop feeding and digesting their food when
water temps near 50 degrees F. But just because it’s 50 degrees out-
side doesn’t mean your pond is that cool. Your filter circulates the
water in your pond twice every hour (or at least it should), so your
pond doesn’t have much of a cool sink (a calm, undisturbed area
where cool water can collect) at the bottom. As a result, your
water may be warmer than the air temperature because it can pick
up heat from the sun while being moved about by the filter’s pump.
Of course, if you heat your pond, the air temperature has less
effect on the water temperature.
Use a pool thermometer to check the temperature at the bottom of
the pond in both heated and unheated situations. Monitoring the
water temperature will prevent the surprises that can arise because
of sudden weather changes or heater failure. Two types of ther-
mometers are
 A digital version with a probe at the end of a cable for pond use
 A submersible thermometer tied to the end of a nylon cord
Make the cord long enough so the thermometer hangs near
the bottom of the pond. (For obvious reasons, be sure to
secure the out-of-pond end of the cord to a structure at the
edge of the pond!)
You want to know the temperature near the bottom of the pond in
case you lose power some cold, wintry day. If the bottom of your
pool dips below 50 degrees, you have to take action (see Chapter
17 on what to do when your power goes out).
Following are koi-feeding guidelines keyed to water temperature:
 Over 75 degrees: Feed floating pellets two to four times a day,
as much as the fish will consume in 5 minutes or so.
 70 to 75 degrees: Feed floating pellets two to four times a day,
but add koi cubes or a treat such as earthworms or crayfish
twice a week to bulk up the fish for cold resistance.
 55 to 70 degrees: Feed wheat germ pellets twice a day.
When the water temperature falls below 59 degrees (15
degrees Celsius), koi metabolism also falls. Provide a food
that’s readily digested because the friendly bacteria in the gut
(that digest the food) also slow down. Because your fish
aren’t active, they don’t need much protein.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
180

 50 to 55 degrees: Feed wheat germ pellets once a day.
 50 degrees and below: Do not feed when water temperatures
remain at 50 degrees or less.
Establishing the Timing and Right
Amounts for Feedings
Koi seem to be willing to eat any time food hits the pond surface.
But when koi are fed until they’re stuffed, their excretion rate
increases, which in turn increases ammonia levels in the water.
High ammonia levels and the bloom in the bacteria that eat the
unconsumed food can overwhelm a filter that had been perfectly
satisfactory. The water becomes foul, and your fish are in trouble
as they try to extract oxygen from the icky soup they now swim in.
So go easy on the feedings until you see for yourself what quantity
to offer. You can feed less at each feeding and increase the number
of feedings if you’re concerned about your koi going hungry.
Rather than measuring out a specific amount of food to feed your
koi at every feeding, use the time rule: Toss some pellets into the
pond and wait five minutes. If the food’s gone, toss in some more
pellets and wait another five minutes. You’re looking for the
amount of food that the koi eat in five minutes. The basic amount
we recommend to begin with is a teaspoon of food per 5 inches of
fish per feeding.
For a very basic maintenance diet, koi need at least 2 percent of
their body weight in food a day. But most koi owners agree that
capturing and weighing koi puts more stress on them than simply
tossing in food and making sure it’s gone within five minutes.
Chapter 11: Koi Nutrition 101 181
If you feed them, they will grow
One of the interesting facts about koi is that they never stop growing. The growth
rate slows as the fish reach sexual maturity at 10 to 12 inches, but koi continue to
grow throughout their lives unless something intervenes (like the pond becomes
crowded or the water quality deteriorates). This fact explains why the 1-meter koi
looms out there like a big juicy tempting plum.
Because koi generally grow less during the winter and more during the summer,
you can actually figure out how old a koi is. They add growth rings to their scales.
Alas, if koi are in warm ponds year-round and fed year-round, the rings are harder
to count.

Feeding times
Most koi-keepers feed their koi in the morning, using the theory
that filter can pull the waste from the pond before the fish sub-
merge to the bottom of the pond at night. In actuality, any daylight
hour is a good time to feed your koi, but try to stick to a schedule.
You’ll soon find your fish gathering near the feeding station just
before feeding time, getting very excited as you approach. Keep in
mind that smaller amounts of food given more frequently put less
strain on your filter.
Even during the warmer months you may have a reason not to feed
your koi every day. Koi that are going to be shipped or exhibited in
a show are not fed for several days before the ship or show date.
The lack of food ensures the koi don’t excrete while in their ship-
ping container so they don’t have to breathe contaminated water.
Hand feeding
Many koi-keepers enjoy feeding their koi by hand. They put the pel-
lets in their hand, sit by the pond, and lower their hand into the
water until the pellets are floating a few inches above their hand.
Koi will shove each other out of the way as they suck in the food,
and occasionally they’ll sample — and discard — your hand. Don’t
worry, it just tickles.
Using automatic feeders
Automatic feeders are one way to make sure your koi are fed.
These feeders work either on a timer or on demand, where the koi
nudge a pendulum on the feeder base.
For fry, the timed feeder is best because they’re too small to acti-
vate the demand feeder, and they need food at regular intervals.
Timed feeders can be activated by solar panels (which need only
light, not direct sun), by spring-loaded built-in timers, by computer
signals, or by electricity.
Select the one that works best for you (and for your budget). Adult
koi seem to enjoy working the on-demand feeders, and you can set
the feeder hopper to dispense a smaller amount of food upon each
activation if you’re worried your koi will make pigs of themselves.

Diffusing Koi Stress
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basics of stress
 Recognizing stress in fish
 Identifying the causes and lowering your koi’s stress (but not necessarily
yours)
S
tress is an unavoidable part of life for any living creature. It’s
simply a reaction to something uncomfortable or new, which
translates at first blush to possibly dangerous. A creature’s avoid-
ance reaction is a lifesaving gesture; fish in the wild simply swim
away from the perceived problem or anxiety source. But koi under
our care can’t leap out and go searching for greener pastures, so 
to speak. If ammonia levels in the pond are too high, those fish are
stuck. And being stuck topples their anxiety into stress.
In this chapter, we help you notice when your koi are stressed and
help you understand the factors that most often cause that stress.
We also tell you how to alleviate or remove those stressors. In most
cases, fixing the problem just requires a bit of work and forethought
on your part.
How Can a Fish Possibly 
Feel Stress?
Human stress has two sides — emotional and physical. Although
it’s difficult for us to understand the emotional life of a koi, or any
other animal for that matter, the physical aspects of stress operate
very similarly in both humans and animals. Basically, when an
animal perceives a dangerous or disturbing situation, his body
releases a variety of chemical messengers to help deal with the
problem (enter the fight or flight reaction). The threatened creature
is physically prepared by his various hormones and chemical mes-
sengers to take appropriate action in the form of defense or escape.
A number of bodily functions are affected — eyesight sharpens,

running speed increases by adrenaline, digestion is suspended to
allow blood to flow to the brain and limbs, and so on.
These reactions are necessary to the survival of all creatures.
Problems arise, however, in unnatural situations — captivity, in
particular. The creature’s system is being flooded with chemicals
that are preparing it to escape, but it has nowhere to go. For exam-
ple, if ammonia levels in the pond are high, the koi must deal with
the adverse effects of the ammonia as well as the conflicting sig-
nals within their own bodies.
Although useful in crisis situations, the stress chemicals cause
severe health problems if they are released long term, especially 
if the animal can’t react appropriately — where, for example, the
koi’s body is being primed to swim quickly, but it can’t. Another
health issue is the fact that, in times of stress, the body shuts
down functions that aren’t essential to immediate survival. The
most common areas are digestion and reproduction, and, over
time, these can be severely impaired.
Of even more concern is the long-term effect on the immune
system — animals under stress sicken and die from ailments 
or micro-organisms that may normally be of little consequence.
Stress is one of the most serious aspects of fish health but isn’t
well understood and is easily overlooked. Providing your koi with a
suitable, stress-free captive environment is a vital step in ensuring
their good health.
Signs Your Koi Are Stressing Out
Because koi aren’t exactly big talkers, how on earth can they tell
you anything, much less mention that they’re stressed? You don’t
always need words to detect stress.
A huge part of detecting stress is observance. You simply watch
your fish and let their behavior tell you how they’re feeling.
The signs of illness in koi are both specific and nonspecific. The
nonspecific signs are behavioral, and the specific indications are
physical symptoms. The following examples are typical stress
behaviors and indications to watch for:
 Failing to snorkel near the surface when feeder is near
 Jumping
 Lying partially on its side
 Remaining near the bottom of the pond
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
184

 Rubbing against items in the pond, as if to dislodge something
from the skin
 Staying by itself; not joining with others to feed
 Swimming lethargically or with a tighter, almost jerky rhythm
 Trying to hide under ledges or under waterfall outflows
Physical symptoms are changes in appearance that often point to a
specific disease. They include
 Clamped fins
 Fin damage
 Pale gills
 Raised scales
 Swollen areas of the body
 White spots on the body and gills
You can use mechanical ways to find out whether the problem is
with your pond or your fish’s health. For example, you can test 
the water for ammonia levels, or you can net and bowl your big
Yamabuki (“yamabuki” is short for the Japanese term “Yamabuki
Ogon” and refers to koi that are bright yellow in color) and see
whether its gill covers have a problem (for a description of gill 
lice, see Chapter 13).
Sources of Stress and 
How to Fix Them
Pretty much all the stress that koi experience is human-caused. This
is one of those blanket statements that points the finger of responsi-
bility right at you, the koi owner. You put a pond in and okayed the
design and the filtration system. You selected the koi — and the
number of koi for the pond. And you decided to enter that 24-inch
Shiro Bekko (a white koi with black markings) in the next koi show.
The good news is that, when you know your koi’s stressor, you can
take steps to alleviate the problem.
All this responsibility may seem a bit daunting, but don’t let it
weigh you down. Koi are too beautiful and too enjoyable to allow
you to be discouraged, and most times, your koi are just fine as
long as you provide them with adequate food and care. In this 
section, we look at what, specifically, causes stress in koi and 
how you can avoid or remedy stressful situations.
Chapter 12: Diffusing Koi Stress 185

Water quality
The quality of your water (or lack thereof) is the biggest source 
of potential stress for your koi. Day in, day out, night in, night out,
your koi breathe in water, extract oxygen, and push the water back
out. But in fish, gills have a dual role — in addition to allowing for
respiration, they are also excretory organs. As a result, fish excrete
ammonia across their gill surface and release it into the water.
Therefore, a water-quality test should be your first reaction to any
abnormal behavior (lethargy, rubbing, disinterest in food, and so
forth) that your koi exhibit.
Water in a clean pond dilutes the excreted ammonia, and then the
bacteria in the biological filter (see Chapter 6) gobble it up. But in
a dirty pond, or a pond with a nonfunctioning biological filter, the
ammonia levels build up. Ammonia levels increase after the koi
have been fed, and they really go up when koi are overfed. The
higher the ammonia level in the pond, the more difficulties your
koi have trying to push their ammonia out across their gill surface
and in breathing in general.
In people, ammonia irritates lung tissue. Irritated bronchioles can’t
absorb oxygen or exchange carbon dioxide. Fish have a similar
reaction. Exposure to environmental ammonia makes the gill 
coverings swell. The rate of water flow across the gill surface
decreases as does the gas exchange rate (the flow of oxygen into
and carbon dioxide out of the body). Your koi may try to dislodge
this irritation by rubbing the sides of its face/gills against a hard
surface. Unless you pull out your water test kit (see Chapter 5) and
discover the high ammonia content, you may think your koi has
parasites (see Chapter 13).
Low oxygen levels
Check your pond’s dissolved oxygen levels, although fish that can’t
get enough oxygen from the water generally will be at the water’s
surface, gasping. While you’re trying to ID the reason for the lower
oxygen levels, add a compressor and a couple of big airstones to
your pond to make your koi more comfortable while you nail down
the cause of the problem. In addition to the airstones, do a partial
water change and add a trickle feature to your filter outflow. The
trickle feature can be a waterfall or a fountain, or you can let the
water from the filter roll down a flat surface before it enters the
pond — anything to increase the surface area exposed to the air.
Now you can look for the cause of the problem.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
186

The oxygen levels can be depressed because of hot weather, pond
additives such as potassium permanganate or an algaecide like
AlgaeFix, or too many koi in your pond.
Crowding
Koi don’t deal well with crowds because a crowded pond affects
water quality. All your tests may tell you your pond’s water quality
is within acceptable parameters, but if you have too many koi in
your pond, those fish are living in a narrow band of water quality.
Anything that decreases that water quality has an immediate effect
on the fish. One small change (for example, the weather gets
hotter, causing the water to contain less oxygen, or sudden cool
weather causes the warmer lower layer of water to rise, bringing
with it fish waste that had settled to the pond’s bottom) and sud-
denly all your fish are affected.
How do you avoid crowding your koi? Use our formula of 1 1⁄2
inches of koi per square foot of pond surface. A 9-x-9-foot pond 
has 81 square feet of surface area and can be home to a total of 
80 inches of koi — or eight 10-inchers.
Keep in mind that these fish are going to grow at least 4 inches per
fish per year. Now, a sensible person would just sell off a fish a year
to keep the total inches to a reasonable level. But real koi nuts like
us just build a bigger pond!
Moving your fish
Who doesn’t get stressed out by the idea of a big move? Even the
hardiest of souls gets a little rattled with all the packing, unpack-
ing, unfamiliar surroundings, and so on.
Chapter 12: Diffusing Koi Stress 187
Watch out for triggers you can’t control
You can be as vigilant as possible, but sometimes happenings outside your control
affect your water quality. For instance, it rains after your neighbor fertilizes his lawn,
so some of that fertilizer runs off into your pond. Careful planning in the initial stages
of pond construction — locating it away from an area bordering on a neighbor’s
lawn, for example — can go a long way in preventing such problems. But don’t
expect to be able to foresee everything. Plan as best you can, but remain alert and
be prepared to take emergency action when necessary.

Again, your koi are no different. Netting and moving your koi
stresses them. When you move your fish, you’re moving your fish
literally into new waters. The pH is different, the water tempera-
ture may be different, and the levels of dissolved gases (including
oxygen and ammonia) are different. Even the light levels are differ-
ent, especially at a new site.
A koi’s reaction to a move will be influenced by many things, includ-
ing the length of the process, the degree of difference in the two envi-
ronments, and the fish’s individual character. Upon introduction to
their new home, your koi may swim about quickly for a short time,
and then remain fairly still in deep water or under cover. This is a
normal reaction to stress, and should pass within a day or so. They
will also likely not eat for the first day or two. If they are not behaving
normally within two to three days, you should check your water
quality and make adjustments as necessary.
Moving your koi to a new place with little or no stress is a fairly
simple process, but not a fast one. If you’re bringing in some new
koi or moving them from an old pond to a newer, bigger pond (koi
ponds only get bigger), you need to acclimate your fish to the new
water. Follow these steps:
1. Add some of the new pond water to the water in the plas-
tic bag or transport dish and then wait five minutes.
2. Test the water in the bag for ammonia and nitrite level,
and check the temperature. Add some more water and
wait again.
3. Repeat these steps until your test kit and thermometer
show no difference between the two waters.
For more precautions when adding new fish, see Chapter 5.
After your koi are in their new digs, keep an eye on them for a 
few days, even if they’re by themselves in a quarantine pond. The
stress of the move makes them susceptible to almost everything:
particles floating around in the water, subclinical conditions, you
name it.
If at all possible, provide a darkened area for your new koi. Koi
adjust better to change when they feel secure, and they feel secure
in darkened areas. Some koi owners put their plastic koi bags —
the ones used for shipping koi — into black plastic bags before the
bag/koi combination goes into the shipping container, or styro. If
your pond doesn’t have darker areas in the deepest portion, try 
to shade part of the pond to create a darker area.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
188

Temperature extremes
Koi are very tolerant carp temperature-wise. They can live in out-
door ponds in water temperatures of 36 to 85 degrees F. But keep
in mind that the temperature in these ponds should fluctuate
slowly, giving the fish a chance to acclimate.
When the water’s too cold
Your pond thermometer should read above 50 degrees. Much
colder than that, and your water freezes — “Goodbye, koi,” and
“Hello, fish popsicle.”
Normally, semidormant koi in a winterized pond between 36 and 50
degrees stay in motion, swimming very slowly or pausing and
remaining upright in the pond. In ponds where the water tempera-
ture is above 50 degrees, koi move around more readily and feed.
Koi that are too cold are lethargic, lie at an angle on the bottom of
the pond, and don’t feed. If the water remains below 50 degrees for
too long, they may die.
You can use several methods to correct a too-cold pond, beginning
with temporary quick fixes and moving toward maintenance for
getting through the whole winter in good shape:
 Make partial water changes, providing the temperature of
the new water is warmer than the pond water. Don’t change
more than 30 percent of the water and be sure to dechlorinate
as you add the water.
 Add a pond heater. For a smaller pond (less than 1,000 gal-
lons), you can use electric heating tubes. They look much like
your standard aquarium heater, but are larger, more durable,
and use more current.
You can also opt for a gas unit that’s part of the pond 
construction and hooks up to your filtering system.
 Cover the pond with a plastic tarp or an insulated pool
cover (leave one corner uncovered to allow for gas
exchange) to prevent heat loss. By monitoring the water’s
temperature after the cover is in place, you should be able to
adjust what parts of the pond are covered and how long the
cover is in place.
Refer to Chapter 9 for detailed information on how to winterize
your pond.
Chapter 12: Diffusing Koi Stress 189

When the pond’s too warm
If your pond thermometer reads above 82 degrees, you don’t have
much of a margin of safety. Your koi are probably rolling near the
water’s surface, gasping for oxygen.
One reason koi ponds need to be at least 3 feet deep is for temper-
ature stability. Ever notice how warm the water in a kid’s 8- inch-
high swimming pool gets on a summer’s day, especially when the
pool is in the sun? The deeper a koi pond is, the more stable its
water temperature can be. And with less direct sunlight, the koi
pond can stay even cooler.
Although koi are fine in water that may reach 85 degrees, you’re
pushing the envelope. Temps this warm stress your koi because
warm water holds less oxygen, which makes koi work harder to
breathe. This extra work makes koi sitting ducks, as the saying
goes, if one of them gets a scrape or if the ammonia levels rise.
To cool your pond immediately, add cold water to your pond (usu-
ally, the temperature of the water as it leaves the tap is suitable).
Again, add no more than 30 percent of the pond volume, and
dechlorinate as you add the water.
If a too-warm pond is a chronic problem for you, try shading part
of or the entire pond with woven bamboo screening. You can use
bamboo window shades (available in home improvement stores)
or the woven shade cloth that gardeners use to shield plants from
the sun. See Chapter 8 for more on landscaping the pond.
Other potential causes
Koi may indicate their discomfort by jumping. If the ammonia and
nitrite levels in the water are okay, there has to be another reason
for the acrobatics.
Do you have a submersible pump? Submersibles have been known
to short-circuit, and when this happens, your fish are going to feel
it. Don’t bother to get the pump fixed; you and your koi are better
off if you replace the submersible with an in-line pump.
Are your koi new to the pond? Koi may jump if the pond is new 
to them. Sometimes differing water chemistry values, although
acceptable, are different enough from what the koi is used to, and
the fish feels, well, jumpy. Adding some koi tunnels on the bottom
of the pond or some floating pieces of Styrofoam to the pond will
give them a place of refuge and increase their security level.

T
his is the chapter we hope you never need, but if your koi get
sick, this information can help you figure out the problem and
its remedy. Our goal is to help you avoid the loss of even one koi.
Koi can seem delicate when you realize everything that can make
them sick — the quick change of their pond’s temperature, below
par water quality, new koi that haven’t gone through a 30-day quar-
antine period, and so on.
The amazing part is that after you know the cause and make a few
corrections, the koi get well (if the condition hasn’t gone on too
long). Usually. We add the qualifier because koi with koi herpes
virus (KHV) don’t get well. This virus has no treatment and the 
disease is highly contagious to other koi.
Everyone understands that when an expensive koi gets sick, the
effort to save that koi is worthwhile. But we think all koi, even
those that aren’t drop-dead gorgeous, deserve the very same
effort. So in this chapter, we give you all you need to recognize a

sick koi, to identify (or at least narrow down) the problem, and to
start treating your beloved pet.
Empowering You, Because 
Koi Vets Are Few
Koi vets in the United States are few and far between. In fact, koi
vets are rare around the world.
Part of the reason for the low number is the low number of koi-
keepers (compared to dog and cat owners, for example). And part
of the reason is that people don’t know about koi. Think about it.
Koi don’t need to be walked, they don’t need shots, and they don’t
bring home fleas. What’s not to love about koi?
The demand for small-animal care is a lot greater than the demand
for koi medical care, so veterinary colleges spend very little time
offering courses in fish care of any type. Veterinarians learn koi-
keeping details after graduation, from other veterinarians,
advanced courses, books, koi-keepers, and koi breeders.
Don’t fret, though. This chapter provides a load of guidance to help
you diagnose and treat your sick koi. If you also want to seek pro-
fessional guidance, consult one or more of the following sources:
 Your local veterinarian: Although only a dozen or so koi vet-
erinarians practice in the United States, almost every veteri-
narian can help when problems crop up in your pond.
 Fish farms and aquariums: Tropical-fish farms in Florida
often have a veterinarian on staff. Commercial aquariums, like
the Tennessee Aquarium, employ their own veterinarian.
These veterinarians may be able to answer your questions.
 Koi health specialists: The lack of formal veterinary training has
led to another specialization, koi health specialist. Any serious
hobbyist can take this certificate program. The United States
has two programs: one is operated by the Mid-Atlantic Koi Club
(MAKC, www.makc.com) and the other by the American Koi
Association.
 Other koi fanciers: Talk to other koi-keepers because most
likely they’ve been there, done that, and they’re great at shar-
ing their expertise. 
Search online through the Mid-Atlantic Koi Club (see earlier
bullet) or the Associated Koi Clubs of America Web sites for
contact information. If you’re not handy with the Web, ask
your local public librarian to help you make the search.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
192

Before you contact someone about your koi’s ailment, be prepared
to answer the questions that you wil be asked: 
 How old is your fish? (Younger koi are more susceptible to
KHV and spring viremia of carp [SVC] viruses.)
 How long have you had the fish?
 When did you notice that something was wrong?
 Is the fish eating?
 What size is your pond?
 How many fish are in it?
 What are your water chemistry values?
 What type of filtration do you use?
 Have you added any new fish to the pond?
 Has the fish been treated with any medications?
 How is the fish acting?
Taking a Close Look: The 
Do-It-Yourself Koi Exam
The diagnosis of koi ailments is a tricky business, and serious
problems are best left to a veterinarian. However, it is, in some
respects, an art as well as a science, and therefore as you gain
experience you may learn to recognize certain problems.
Catching your koi
In order to closely examine your koi, you will first need to contain
it within a small place. This can be quite difficult or easy, depend-
ing upon the size of your pond, the koi’s temperament and state of
health, and your own skill. You may want to practice netting and
bowling your koi when your fish are healthy, so that you will be
prepared in the event a fish falls ill.
Examining your sickly fish
Signs of injury and disease in koi range from very obvious to 
quite subtle. A comprehensive physical exam, as described in this
section, offers the best chance of detecting your koi’s particular
ailment.
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 193

Surveying his overall appearance
Although netting and bowling your koi adds to its stress, you need
to examine him to identify the problem and treat the illness. Once
he’s in the bowl:
1. Look for external parasites.
(See the section on parasites later in this chapter to help
you ID and deal with them.)
2. Look for any open wounds, or abnormal appearance to
the body or fins.
3. Lift your koi out of the water using your wetted hands,
and check for lesions or open wounds on his underside.
4. Put him back in the bowl when you’re done, and gently
pour out most of the water in the bowl so you can take a
swab or a scraping.
Taking a swab or scrape
Taking a swab is not as traumatic as it sounds. Follow these steps:
1. Drag and roll a wet cotton swab over the gill covers, or
along the base of the dorsal fin, or along the base of the
tail to gather some of the mucous that coats the fish’s body.
Always swab from the head to the tail, working in the direc-
tion the scales grow.
2. Roll the swab along the surface of a microscope slide,
add a drop of pond water and a cover slip, and examine
the mucous (after it’s on a slide, it’s called a smear) under
a microscope.
As an alternative, your veterinarian may furnish you with
the swab, a tube, and a mailer envelope to send the speci-
men to a lab to identify possible bacteria.
If the swab is inconclusive, or if external parasites are suspected,
your veterinarian may suggest the slightly more invasive skin
scrape. To take a skin scrape, do the following:
1. Scrape a blunt object, like a glass slide, along the body to
gather some of the mucous.
This step is the same as Step 1 for the swab, but because
you need to apply a bit more pressure, have someone hold
the fish while you gently but firmly scrape off some mucous.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
194

Always scrape in the direction of the scales; never run
against them. Because the scraping peels off external para-
sites between the scales, scrape where you think your koi
is most stressed, near the gills or near the fins, for instance.
2. Add a droplet of pond water and then a cover slide.
You’re ready to examine the scraping under the 
microscope.
Inspecting the small stuff: Enter, the microscope
When you first look at a smear or a scrape under the microscope,
you may feel as if you’re in uncharted territory. The micro-organisms
that you might encounter exhibit a bewildering array of shapes,
with many appearing to be straight out of a horror movie. However,
with a bit of experience, you may be able to at least identify some
of them in a general way, and this can help point the way toward
an effective treatment.
 Compare what you see under the microscope with the draw-
ings in this book. (See those illustrations throughout this
chapter.)
 Go online for more information on koi parasites. (Check out
www.koicarp.net or search under koi parasites.)
 Ask a more experienced koi-keeper to guide you through this
smear-making and slide examination process that we describe
in the previous section.
You really will get better with practice.
Dealing with Mild 
Traumatic Injuries
Koi encounter few traumas in the pond; they just don’t have many
opportunities bang up against something. Nonetheless, they still
manage to get into a few scrapes.
Some injuries are seasonal and relatively minor. In spring, for
instance, actively breeding koi tend to lose scales as part of the
jostling during courtship. The female in particular may lose patches
of scales and have a split fin or two. The only necessary treatment
is a week or two of R&R in the warm waters of a hospital tank and
away from other koi.
Because butterfly koi have delicate fins, the fins of very young koi
may have dragging damage from the rough bottom of a pond.
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 195

Three-tenths of a percent salt solution (three pounds per 100 gal-
lons of water in your pond) helps the fins heal, but see “Fin rot” in
this chapter for more information on this condition. As fungus can
take hold on damaged fins or skin, keep an eye on these koi while
the fins heal.
Kinked spine also seems trauma-linked, but it can be the result of a
poor diet (very obvious in younger, fast-growing koi), exposure to
high levels of organophosphate insecticides (as a human, you
don’t really want these near you either), or electrocution. Many
times the damage to the spine is permanent and euthanasia is the
logical answer. Koi owners who can’t bear the thought of killing
one of their favorites usually hand feed the affected koi.
Electrocution can occur wherever there’s electricity; when you
combine water and electricity, the chances of something going
amiss only escalate. Electrocution fries the nerve axons, causing
some muscles to become permanently contracted and other mus-
cles to become spasmodic. Because muscle control is gone, the
electrocuted koi swim in a jerky fashion. When the fish are chal-
lenged or stressed, the swimming motions can become even more
erratic until the fish loses the ability to swim altogether. An electro-
cuted fish drops weight — partly because he uses so much of his
energy just trying to swim, but mostly because he can’t compete
with the other koi for food.
The Most Famous Parasites of All
Parasites are a common problem for all fish. When you mention par-
asites with koi, you generally mean the external variety. These 
parasites are always present and easily pass from one fish to another.
The eggs or cysts may remain inactive and undetected until the
weather warms up, but then the birds sing, flowers bud — and all
of a sudden your koi are a-bloom with external parasites.
The problem with a parasitic infestation — other than obviously
damaging your fish through the actions of the parasites them-
selves (feeding on blood and skin tissue, for example) and killing
your appetite for cheese rollatini big-time — is that the condition
sets up your fish for secondary bacterial infections.
The good news about parasites (and we do have some) is that a
salt treatment kills many of them. Sometimes you have to add a
secondary treatment, but salt’s your number-one choice for Ich,
Costia, and Chilodonella. (Check out more about these conditions
and their treatments later in this section.)
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
196

Anchor worms
An anchor worm (see Figure 13-1) is a crustacean that looks like a
worm. The females embed themselves in the skin of a koi, usually
near the gills, around the eyes, on the fins, and on the base of the
fins. A scraping and examination under a microscope can help you
ID the varmint. Adult anchor worms are just under 1⁄4-inch to  1⁄2-inch
long and look like brown or black strands standing out from the
koi’s body. The site of attachment is usually inflamed, and the
involved scales may be raised up a bit from their normal position.
Young anchor worms look like white dots on the skin of the koi.
Figure 13-1: An anchor worm, alone and attacking a koi.
When you find them
Anchor worms are inactive during the winter but become active
when the water warms to the upper 50s. Suddenly all your koi have
anchor worms, and the fish may flash and leap in an attempt to dis-
lodge the little pests. But the bigger problem is that the wounds
caused by the worms are an open door to Aeromonas or Pseudomo-
nas infections because the koi’s resistance is just emerging from
the wintertime slowdown.
You can assume that any koi you buy in late winter or early spring
will come with a few anchor worms.
How you get rid of them
You can physically remove the worms by sedating your koi (see
the section “Sedating Your Koi, Giving Injections, and Other First-
Aid Tasks” at the end of this chapter), placing it on a wet towel on
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 197

a table near the quarantine tub, and pulling off the anchor worms
with tweezers. This is a very time- and labor- intensive job.
Fortunately, Dimilin, the trade name for diflubenzuron, is a proven,
safe way to kill anchor worms in a pond. The dose is one gram per
1,000 gallons. Mix the powder with 1⁄2 cup or so of pond water and
then sprinkle the treated water over the surface of the pond. If you
can’t obtain Dimilin, substitute Program (Lufernon), the anti-flea
medication for dogs. It works the same way and, like Dimilin, is
nontoxic.
To use Program, follow these steps:
1. Pulverize one large-dog-size tablet per 1,000 gallons of
water.
2. Add the powder to an empty gallon milk container.
3. Add water, snap on the lid, and shake to mix the two.
4. Shake the mixture as you distribute it around the perime-
ter of the pond.
5. Turn off your UV sterilizer and remove any carbon you
have in your filter while using these medications. At the
end of a week, turn on your UV sterilizer and replace the
carbon in your filter.
Depending on the temperature of your water, the treatment takes
four to five days to eliminate the anchor worms or lice. We waited
a week, just to make sure the problem was eliminated.
Apiosoma
Apiosoma is a protozoan parasite that looks like a vase with a
fringe of cilia (hairlike projections) around the mouth of the vase.
It’s too small to be easily seen with the naked eye. Typical symp-
toms of this parasite include
 Heavy mucous production.
 Clamped fins.
 Respiratory distress.
 Head flicking (to try to dislodge the parasite — to no avail).
 Loss of appetite.
 Big head (the result of little appetite; the thin koi’s head
seems too big for its body) — this symptom indicates a heavy
Apiosoma infection.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
198

Treat Apiosoma with one of the following methods:
 Add salt to the pond at a concentration of 0.3 percent (three
pounds per 100 gallons in your pond).
 Employ a salt bath with a 2 percent salt solution.
 Add a commercial anti-parasite to the pond (malachite green
and Formalin).
 Add potassium permanganate at 1.5 grams per 220 gallons
(1,000 liters).
Secondary bacterial or fungal infections are expected, so be sure
to read about these in this chapter and be prepared to treat them
as well.
Sometimes a concentrated salt bath is good for koi with a particu-
larly stubborn affliction. In this case, you give your koi a salt bath
as follows:
1. Make a 2 percent solution (not 0.2, but ten times that!) by
using 1 pound of salt to 5 gallons of water and making
sure the salt is dissolved.
2. Place the koi in the bath and watch it carefully.
In two to five minutes, the koi loses its balance and falls to
one side.
3. When this happens, remove the koi and return it to the
hospital tank or the main pond (see the section on hospi-
tal tanks later in this chapter).
You can repeat this process after two days for a total of two baths.
Chilodonella
Chilodonella look a bit like transparent coffee beans under the micro-
scope, with cilia lining the cleft underside of the beans. Like other
protozoans, these are too small to see with the naked eye; they are
diagnosed with a skin scraping. Irritation from Chilodonella can
cause koi to drag their faces and bodies along the pond bottom or
sides. These protozoans are most aggressive when pond tempera-
tures are lower than 68 degrees F.
Symptoms of Chilodonella differ depending on which area of the
koi is most heavily infested. For example:
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 199

 The koi may become lethargic and hold their fins clamped to
their sides.
 The koi may remain near filter outlets because their gills are
affected and can’t function well.
 The skin may be covered by a grayish-white film, even cover-
ing the eyes.
 The koi have respiratory distress.
 Flashing and scraping are typical.
Treat Chilodonella with one of the following methods:
 A concentration of 0.3 percent salt
 Potassium permanganate at 1.5 grams per 220 gallons.
Treat topical damage caused by this parasite with propolis or
malachite green.
Costia
Costia, more correctly known as Ichthyobodo necatrix, is a pear or
“comma” shaped protozoan that moves by means of long, thin
appendages known as flagellum (a second pair is used for feeding).
Invisible to the naked eye, Costia’s “jerky” swimming motions are
readily observable under magnification of 200–400X. Costia attaches
to the koi’s skin and gills, and feeds upon the tissue there.
Koi infected by Costia will cease feeding, become lethargic and gasp
for air, and will often excrete excess mucus.
Costia are best eliminated by treating the pond with potassium per-
manganate, which can be purchased at your pond store or ordered
online. See the section on flukes later in this chapter for specifics
concerning the use of this medication. Additional airstones should
be added if the fish appear to have trouble breathing.
Fish lice
Fish lice, or Argulus, are crustaceans, like anchor worms. They look
like small dots of clear jelly, with dark eyes on one end of their cir-
cular body and cilia at the other end. They pierce the koi’s skin in
order to feed and then inject an anticoagulant so they can feed
unimpeded. The anticoagulant has a toxic effect on the koi, and
may, by itself, be powerful enough to kill small koi. See Figure 13-2
for an illustration.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
200

Figure 13-2: Fish louse, solo and pestering a koi.
Adult fish lice are large enough to see with the naked eye, ranging
in size from just under 1⁄8 inch to 1⁄3 inch across. Infected fish or
plants from an infected pond can bring the lice to your pond. Even
something as innocent as a wading bird can transmit fish lice.
(What are we saying? In koi-world, innocent and wading birds don’t
go together — all the more reason to discourage visits by any
wading birds!)
The presence of fish lice is irritating for at least two reasons:
 Infected koi swim erratically, flashing and scraping against the
side of the pond to dislodge the lice.
Koi can damage their skin in this scraping process, opening an
avenue for secondary infection.
 With a heavy infestation of fish lice, the koi cease feeding and
become lethargic swimmers.
You can remove fish lice from anesthetized koi with tweezers and
then dab the removal site with propolis. (See the section “Sedating
Your Koi, Giving Injections, and Other First-Aid Tasks” later in this
chapter.) Treating the pond with Dimilin and Program, however, is
easier than removing the fish lice manually. Use the same dose as
you’d use for anchor worms (see the earlier section “Anchor worms”
for specifics on these treatments).
Flukes
Body and gill flukes feed on the mucous on a koi’s body and liter-
ally hook themselves into place. Although they’re very common on
koi, they usually don’t cause a problem unless the koi is weakened
by another disease. Treat the flukes with potassium permanganate.
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 201

To treat a pond with potassium permanganate, follow these steps:
1. Turn off the pond filter and dissolve one teaspoon per
1,000 gallons in a bucket of water.
2. Add the pink solution to your koi pond. (The water will
turn pink, and that’s good.)
3. If the pink coloration disappears within 45 minutes, add
another 1⁄2 teaspoon per 1,000 gallons. If the color disap-
pears after two hours, re-dose with 1⁄2 teaspoon per 1,000
gallons.
4. At the end of ten hours, change one-third of the pond
water and turn the filter on. Repeat in seven days.
If the infestation is severe and the flukes are on several fish, you
may want to use Fluke Tabs, a medication available at most pet
stores, that is specifically designed to fight this parasite. Check the
instructions on the box, but generally you can use one tablet per
100 gallons of water.
Ich
Ich (also spelled ick) or white spot looks like little white spots on
the koi’s skin and generally appears when koi experience a sudden
temperature drop. The infestation can only be controlled by killing
the organism in its free-swimming stage, so be sure to follow the
medication timetable carefully.
Symptoms of ich infestation are
 Koi may stop feeding and begin rubbing their bodies against
the pond sides and bottom.
 They may produce so much mucous as a defense against ich
that they take on a whitish tone.
 They may experience respiratory distress when ich attacks
the thin, oxygen-absorbing skin that covers the gills.
Ich is very contagious and has two life stages: a nonswimming
stage on your koi, and a free-swimming stage. The only time ich 
is vulnerable — and therefore treatable — is the free-swimming
stage.
The commercial anti-ich treatments are very effective. Several
products are available, but be sure to follow the instructions pro-
vided by the medication.

Bacterial Infections: Bad 
News Anywhere
Bacteria attack a fish when the opportunity presents itself. Often
this will occur secondarily to another disease or injury, or when
the fish’s immune systems are weakened by the stress of shipment,
handling, poor water quality, or water temperatures that are too
warm or too cold.
The exterior attack
When the bacteria sets in on the outside of a koi, the koi develop
open wounds or ulcers that spontaneously appear
 On the mouth
 On the belly
 As holes in the fins
 As red streaks on the fins
Unless you provide treatment, the hole gets bigger and deeper.
Ulcers
The most common cause of external ulcers are two bacteria,
Aeromonas and Psuedomonas. Although these bacteria are almost
always present, they move in when your koi become stressed (par-
ticularly in the spring when water temperatures are around 60
degrees). Other typical symptoms are excessive mucous produc-
tion and red areas around the edge of the ulcer.
Take the following steps to treat ulcers:
1. Net and bowl the fish.
2. Clean the wound with hydrogen peroxide or mer-
curochrome.
3. Spray a multipurpose antibiotic like Polysporin on the
wound.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 two more times at three-day
intervals.
If you can move your koi to a heated hospital tank for this period,
so much the better.
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 203

When more than one or two fish are affected, do one of the following:
 Treat by feeding an antibiotic-laced diet for two weeks. (Obtain
the diet from your koi dealer or an online koi-product vendor.)
 Add potassium permanganate to the pond at the rate of 1.5
grams for 220 gallons (please see the “Flukes” section earlier
in this chapter for details concerning treating koi with this
medication).
Fin rot
During the warmer summer months, koi may seem healthy yet dis-
play signs of fin rot (also called gill rot, mouth rot, and skin colum-
naris, depending on where the rot attacks). Fin rot is actually
caused by the combination of warm pond water and high ammonia
and pH levels. (Can you imagine being in water so toxic that the
skin on your appendages rots? Oh, ouch!)
These are the affected areas and their symptoms:
 The fins: The first signs are reddening of the fins, then white
patches at the tips of fins where the circulation has been
destroyed, then erosion of the fins.
 The gills: The gills become mucous-laden and then spotted
with white; eventually necrosis develops.
 Mouth rot: This disease appears as a small, white spot near
the nose that soon reddens and spreads.
 Skin columnaris: The first signs are small, white patches,
then heavy mucous production; red patches appear on the
skin and some scale sloughing may occur.
Koi with columnaris feed poorly, especially if the mouth is
involved. They stay near the filter outlets or under the waterfalls,
where the water has more oxygen.
Lower the ammonia level by doing one or more of the following:
 Partially change the water on a daily basis.
 Cool the pond to approximately 75 degrees F.
 Add an ammonia remover such as Zeolite or AmQuel Plus.
 Evaluate and upgrade the processing capacity of your biofil-
ter, making sure it is large enough for your pond’s water
volume and the number and size of the fish in it.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
204

When the problem’s been solved, the fin rot stops and the fins can
heal. Treatment for your koi consists of dabbing the sores with
malachite green, followed by feeding propolis and an antibiotic
feed such as MediKoi for at least ten days.
The inside attack: Internal infections
Internal bacterial infections are always serious, and the outcome is
not guaranteed. The disease is called bloater, pine cone, or dropsy.
In these cases the following occurs:
 The fish swells with the inflammation (sometimes more so on
one side than the other).
 The pressure pushes the scales away from the body.
 The pressure on the fish’s air bladder makes the fish swim
awkwardly.
 The fish’s eyes protrude.
See Figure 13-3 for an example of this disease.
Treatment for dropsy usually includes a stay in a hospital tank, if
possible. Add salt for a 0.3 percent level and slowly heat up the
tank or pond to 77 to 85 degrees. In addition, some koi owners
offer one of the following:
 An antibiotic diet that’s safe to use with salt
 A probiotic feed (feed that has friendly bacteria added)
 Very small amounts of plain yogurt that they hand feed via a
syringe inserted into the mouth and down into the alimentary
cavity, or what passes for a stomach in koi.
Preventing bacterial infection
You can forestall ulcers and dropsy by closely watching your
pond’s water quality and temperature and by adding a probiotic to
the water. Probiotics are friendly bacteria. When you add a probi-
otic (KoiZyme is one) to your pond, you install friendly bacteria
that will compete with Aeromonas or Pseudomonas for any avail-
able nutrients in the water (as in koi waste). The bad bacteria die.
The good bacteria live.
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 205

Figure 13-3: A koi with dropsy (also called pine cone or bloater) disease.
Combine a probiotic with a good filtration system, and you stop a
lot of health problems in their tracks.
Swimmer’s Gill (Or Skin): 
Fungal Infections
Fungus can attack any weakened portion of a koi, from the skin to
the gills. It usually takes hold opportunistically, when the koi are
stressed by injury, disease, shipping, poor water quality, or inap-
propriate water temperatures. Be sure that you always check for
the presence of fungus when your fish suffer an unrelated trauma
or illness.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
206

Got fungus on the gills?
Gill fungus attacks the gills (go figure), and unless you’re paying
close attention, one day your koi’s doing fine and the next day he’s
hanging around the waterfall. A short time later, he’s belly up.
Gill fungus usually crops up in the spring either in ponds that don’t
have adequate aeration or in ponds whose fish-load has outgrown
the filtration system. The koi act lethargic, feed poorly — if at all,
and stay close to the surface of the pond. When you net and bowl
one, the gills look like they have gray cotton growing on them.
Salt, in one percentage or another, is a classic koi treatment, or you
can use one of the commercial fungus treatments.
Fluffy white fur isn’t 
always a good thing
Cotton wool or cotton ball disease is a charming name for a nasty
condition. It’s caused by Saprolegnia, a fungus that grows when
bad water quality stresses the koi. Expect to find it when the water
contains quantities of uneaten food and when the pond has too
many koi for its size.
The koi develop what looks like a fine-textured fur coat over their
bodies that’s actually mold growing on their skin. Sometimes the
fungus looks like a pale-orange or ivory-colored layer, much like
the mold that grows on items left too long in the fridge See Figure
13-4 for an illustration of what koi fungus looks like). As the disease
progresses, the fungus grows longer, cottonlike tufts.
Treat this disease by correcting the conditions that lead to the out-
break:
 Decrease the number of koi in the pond. (Show ponds work
well as holding stations for the excess.)
 Improve water quality via partial water changes, an upgraded
filtration system, an ammonia remover like AmQuel Plus or
Zeolite, and increased aeration.
You can also use medication against the fungus. Adding methylene
blue (a dye commonly used as a fish medication and available at
most pet stores) to the pond at a rate of 1 teaspoon per 700 gallons
helps kill the fungus, but individually treating each affected koi in a
quarantine tub stops the progression of the disease much faster.
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 207

Figure 13-4: Koi with a white fungus patch on its back.
Either sedate the koi or hold it so you can remove the patches of
fungus with a cotton swab. Then dab the affected spots first with
malachite green and then with propolis. (See the section “Sedating
Your Koi, Giving Injections, and Other First-Aid Tasks” later in this
chapter.) Return the fish to the quarantine tub and watch closely
to make certain no secondary fungal or bacterial infection sets in.
The Three Greatest Viral Threats:
Pox, SVK, and KHV
Diseases caused by a virus are tricky. Only a few vaccines have
been developed to fight them, and those or koi are in the very
early stages. With a koi virus, you and your koi pretty much have
to take chances.
In addition to carp pox (koi’s equivalent to the dreaded chicken
pox), you need to know about two other viruses because they’re
far more life-threatening: spring viremia of koi (SVK) and koi
herpes virus (KHV).
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
208

Forget the chicken — 
koi get carp pox
Carp pox appears as tiny, raised drops of paraffin on your koi’s
body or fins. The colors may be white, pink, or gray, and you can
flick them off with your fingernail. Koi show no behavioral changes
to indicate illness, but infected fish are carriers. The pox is a self -
limiting disease, meaning it doesn’t kill adult fish; however, it has a
high mortality rate on koi younger than two months. There is no
treatment, but research is underway for a carp pox vaccine. Adult
fish in otherwise good health will survive, but you should isolate
them from young koi and any new fish that you may acquire. You
may, therefore need to set up a new pond, give infected fish to
someone who maintains others with the disease, or resign yourself
to not breeding or acquiring new fish.
Carp pox is most prevalent in early spring, when water tempera-
tures are less than 68 degrees. If your pond suffers an outbreak,
move the fish, drain the pond, and disinfect with 200 parts per mil-
lion chlorine for one hour to sterilize surfaces; use a quaternary
ammonium compound like Roccal at 500 ppm on nets.
Spring viremia of carp: Predator 
of koi at their most vulnerable
SVC is a virus that attacks koi, other species of carp, and goldfish.
It becomes active in water temperatures of 40 to 68 degrees, when
koi have essentially no immune system.
Symptoms include lethargy, awkward swimming, skin ulcers, and
areas of hemorrhage adjacent to the ulcers. The body may bulge
with septicemia (blood poisoning); bloody mucous may seep out
from the vent. SVC is highly contagious and has a high mortality
rate, especially for young koi. 
There is no treatment for SVC, and surviving koi may become carri-
ers of the virus. It is also a reportable disease. In other words, if it’s
been diagnosed by a USDA-approved laboratory by using a poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) test (which is the only definitive diag-
nosis), federal officials must be notified. The feds will come to your
home and require you to depopulate your fish and disinfect your
pond.
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 209

If you decide against an official diagnosis, sterilize your pond by
draining it and washing it down with a 500 parts per million chlo-
rine solution. Allow the bleach solution to stay on the pond walls
and floor for ten minutes before rinsing.
The quick, sneaky killer: 
Koi herpes virus
KHV is a DNA-based herpes virus that affects only the common
carp and koi. The virus becomes active when water temperatures
are between 64 and 81 degrees and it spreads via direct contact,
exposure to fecal material, or infected water.
Koi with KHV become lethargic in their swimming, stay near the
surface, and have difficulty breathing. Their gills become mottled
red and white, indicating some hemorrhaging and blood clotting
dysfunction. Death usually follows 24 to 48 hours after the symp-
toms appear. The diagnosis is confirmed with a PCR test, but the
disease is not notifiable (in other words, federal veterinary officials
need not be alerted).
Post mortem examination shows infections by bacteria and fungus
on all skin surfaces, including the gill surfaces, so obviously KHV
plays hob with a koi’s immune system.
There is no treatment for KHV. You can prevent its spread by using
a quarantine tub and by paying close attention to sanitation. For a
pond where KHV has been confirmed, follow these steps:
1. Empty and scrub the pond with a sanitizer such as
• A solution of 200 parts per million chlorine
• A mixture of 0.26 ounces of Roccal Plus D to a gallon
of water
2. Rinse all surfaces.
3. Sanitize all pond equipment, nets, and bowls.
KHV has been reported from the U.S., Europe, Israel, and Japan.
The 2005 outbreak in Niigata was traced back to a single, bor-
rowed, imported koi. The unfortunate result was the depopulation
of at least five koi breeders’ stock.
At koi shows, officials may decide to limit possible exposure to
KHV by keeping all the fish belonging to one individual in his or
her own show pond or ponds. Judges go from pond to pond, net-
ting and bowling all the koi pertaining to the class being judged at
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
210

that time. This is called the English style, as opposed to the
Japanese syle of grouping all koi of a particular show class in a
single show pond. Nets and bowls are currently restricted to one-
container and one-koi use, and they’re sanitized with Roccal
between uses. Roccal can be diluted to 0.5 ounce per gallon and
used to disinfect hands between handling koi.
Keeping your old koi safe 
from viral infection
Your best bet for avoiding KHV is to select your koi vendors care-
fully and use your quarantine tub for all additions to your pond.
You can select quarantine conditions that predispose new koi to
developing SVC or KHV if either virus is already present. The
advantage in this safety net is that only your new koi die, not your
entire collection. Essentially, you simply change the temperature of
the quarantine tub and wait for signs of SVC or KHV to show up.
Follow these steps:
1. Place your new koi in the tub but don’t turn on the
heater. Keep temperatures of the tub in the low 60s for
two to three weeks.
2. Turn on the heater, increasing the temperature no more
than 5 degrees within a 24-hour period until the water is
75 degrees.
3. Keep the tank at that temperature for two to three weeks.
If SVC is present, it will manifest itself when the water tempera-
ture’s between 40 and 68 degrees; KHV will manifest itself when the
water’s between 72 and 81 degrees. Unfortunately, the infected fish
will die. Be sure to disinfect your quarantine tub as described ear-
lier before using it again.
Setting up the Hospital Tank
The hospital tank is much like the quarantine tub — an isolation
tank where you can treat only the fish that need it. Always have at
least two koi in a hospital tank, even if only one of them needs the
treatment. Koi are not solitary creatures and the stress inherent to
sickness and treatment will be lessened if they have company. A
lower stress level will benefit the immune system and aid the fish
in its recovery.
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 211

You can create a hospital tank out of a stock tank, a show tank, or a
150-gallon or larger polyethylene bin. A bottom drain fitting allows
you to clean and drain it more easily, and they’re usually salted to
0.3 percent.
Set the hospital tank up in a spot that’s out of the sun and pro-
tected from adverse weather. Use the following equipment:
 A filter: Either a standard three-compartment filter or a poly-
bead filter (see Chapter 3 for more on these filter types).
Set the filter up to pull from the bottom drain or a retrofitted
bottom drain; another variation is to place the inflow and out-
flow pipes over opposite ends of the tank.
Add a foam prefilter to the filter intake to protect your fish
from being grabbed by the filter suction.
 A heater: 200- to 300-watt heaters are large enough for a 100-
gallon tank.
 A thermometer: One used for an aquarium will work just fine,
but pond thermometers are larger and easier to read.
 An aeration pump with an airstone: This equipment ensures
adequate aeration and water circulation.
Drape the airstone tubing over the edge of the bin and place it
as near to the bottom of the bin as possible; the longer dis-
tance the bubbles travel, the greater the oxygen absorption.
Do not turn on the heater until you put your koi into the tank, and
only increase the temperature 3 to 5 degrees a day — any faster is
too fast for your koi to adjust to. Because the immune system of a
koi is most efficient when the fish is warmed, keep the water
between 78 and 82 degrees.
Cover the hospital tank with bird netting or with a fitted mesh
cover. Distressed koi and koi placed in much-smaller-than-usual
housing tend to jump.
Sedating Your Koi, Giving
Injections, and Other 
First-Aid Tasks
At some point you may need to give your koi an injection, dab
malachite green on an ulcer, or remove a bit of a fin or a specimen
from the edge of a wound to ID the bacteria at fault.
Part III: Caring for Koi and Keeping Them Healthy 
212

In any case, you’ll need to anesthetize your koi. You can do this
safely and easily, but the process requires your undivided atten-
tion. Follow these steps:
1. Gather the equipment:
• A koi bowl or child’s wading pool with a few gallons of
pond water aerated by an airstone
• A nearby table covered with wet towels and a few
more wet towels to prop up the koi
• The anesthetic (three choices), added to the koi bowl
or pond:
Tricaine-S added to the water in the bowl at the rate
of 200 milligrams per 2 pounds of koi
Four drops of Oil of Cloves per gallon of water in the
bowl
Six drops of Eugenol added to the water in the bowl
• A tuberculin syringe (you can usually get these at
your local pharmacy in the section with diabetic 
supplies)
• A broad-spectrum antibiotic: Baytril or Amikacin
2. Add the koi and watch him until he rolls over.
This only takes a few minutes. The duration of the anes-
thetic effect averages 4 to 10 minutes, but is affected by a
host of factors, and is therefore highly variable. It is best to
review everything beforehand, so that you will be able to
work swiftly and effectively. If the fish begins to recover
before you are finished, do your best to complete the task
at hand. Try to avoid a second period of anesthesia, but if
you must do so, wait for 1 hour before putting the fish
“back under.”
3. Lift the anesthetized koi to your table and prop him up
with the towels.
4. There are two sites for injecting your koi. Pull the pec-
toral fin towards the fish’s mouth, and inject the antibi-
otic into the fleshy lump behind the fin. The older
method is to inject into the koi’s belly, between the pelvic
fins (see Figure 13-5).
Chapter 13: Spotting and Treating Common Koi Ailments 213

Figure 13-5: How to give a koi an injection.
To treat an ulcer:
1. Prop the koi so the ulcer is uppermost.
2. Use cotton swabs to first dry the wound and then paint
the ulcer with malachite green, changing the swabs as
needed.
3. Add spray-on propolis (for its antioxidant qualities) over
the malachite green.
To remove a specimen:
1. Take a pair of very sharp scissors to clip off the very
edge of a fin or use a moistened swab to tease up a bit of
the mucous and debris at the edge of a wound.
2. Place the specimen or swab in a specimen tube for mail-
ing to a lab, and seal the tube. (See the earlier section
“Examining your sickly fish” for more about this process.)
When the operation is over:
1. Place the koi in a blue bowl filled with fresh water from
the pond. (The water should be heavily aerated.)
2. Keep the koi in the bowl until normal breathing is re-
established. (Move him back and forth to put fresh water
over the gills until he begins to move his fins or twitch
his gills.)
3. Wait another minute and then put him back in the pond;
watch him for a few moments to make certain he’s capa-
ble of swimming under his own power.

Koi Breeding 
and Showing

In this part . . .
W
ho can resist the sight of a vendor’s show pond all
set up with a bunch of new koi, each as pretty as
all get-out and priced at pretty reasonable rates? You stop
yourself — just like a home movie where the ﬁlm slips 
off the spindle — and you think, “I have koi. Why don’t 
I do this?”
Well sure, you can breed your koi, but this adventure can
be oh-so-much easier if you ﬁrst ﬁnd out how to raise the
young before you dim the pond lights and start playing
Spanish Eyes for your favorite pair of koi. The chapters in
this part tell you what to expect during breeding and how
to hatch and raise the young. We also give you some
insights on showing your koi and enjoying the show.

W
hat if you want to get in on the ground floor, so to speak,
when it comes to good koi? Breeding your fish and watch-
ing as the fry (hatchlings) emerge from the eggs is a real highlight
of koi-keeping.
Breeding koi can be a complicated but fulfilling hobby. It certainly
opens up a new world of knowledge, pond maintenance refine-
ments, and koi behavior, and it offers you a ringside introduction
to koi-keepers who regularly and successfully produce koi.
This chapter helps you decide whether you’d like to start a breed-
ing program and what’s involved if you do. We also give you a
heads-up on the characteristics you can and can’t breed for.
To Breed or Not to Breed: 
That Is the Question
Do you really want to breed your koi? Watching your fish repro-
duce can open up a whole new aspect of the hobby to you and 
will likely hook you on koi for good. You learn a great deal in the
process and may even be able to add your own unique twists that
can help future koi breeders.

Consider some of these pros for breeding:
 It’s a do-it-yourself way to get more koi. At the same time,
you have the fun of watching the young grow and see how
their colors develop over time. (Let’s see, this is year five, so
the red [called Hi in koi terms] should be getting deeper and
the Sumi should be spreading. . . .)
 You can make some cold, hard cash. Other koi-keepers like
and appreciate koi, and most of them like to add to their col-
lection. Of course, this is only a benefit for those who have a
market (that is, can sell their koi) and can make enough
money to at least break even.
 The learning process is very stimulating and will probably
spur you on to read, research, and speak with other hobby-
ists and professionals.
 The lessons you pick up from breeding koi are transferable to
other fish species if you’re inclined to expand your interests.
 Breeding is a great way to attract friends and family to your
hobby and to share it with them.
Breeding also has some negative points:
 It takes time.
 It takes money.
 It takes additional space.
 It’s a boisterous sport; your fish, especially your female, may be
damaged (see “Letting your koi have at it” later in this chapter).
 Most noticeably, it can produce tens of thousands of baby koi.
Many die off before you make a single move toward culling
(selective reduction), but you still need to cull, probably sev-
eral times (see Chapter 15 for more on this process). At the
least, you end up with a hundred or so 1- to 2-inch baby koi.
Predictions You Can Make 
(And Those You Can’t)
Trying to predict what characteristics will be expressed (that is, be
evident) in a particular breeding is complicated, mostly because
we don’t know what recessive genes a given koi carries. As a result,
breeding between a selected pair of koi produces a hodge-podge of
gene expression in the 5,000-plus young.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
218

If you were to keep records and photos from breeding the same
pair year after year, maybe you could get a sense about the young
koi from that pair — but maybe not. Breeding koi is that unpre-
dictable. You can only be sure of two facts: They’ll all be koi, and
only some of them will look like one parent or the other — many
won’t look like either.
Nevertheless, some characteristics in koi do breed true. Take a
look at the following characteristics to get an idea:
 Scale patterns: Normal-scaled koi that mate with each other
generally produce normal-scaled offspring, and mated pairs 
of mirror-scaled koi usually produce mirror-scaled young.
Parents of both types, however, can carry the genes for other
scale patterns, in which case the fry’s scales will vary.
Leather-skinned koi pairs produce leather-skinned (predomi-
nantly) and mirror-scaled young.
When line-scaled koi are paired with line-scaled mates, the
resulting young exhibit a variety of scale patterns.
 Metallic sheen: Metallic sheen is dominant over normal sheen
when the parent koi are a white-skinned or black-skinned vari-
ety. If both parents have one gene for metallic sheen and one
for normal sheen, they and their offspring look metallic.
 Color and color pattern: Koi color genetics are complex, and
two koi that seem identical in color and basic pattern may
arrive at that color and pattern with differing genetic mixes.
Unless you begin with a male and a female of one variety from
a single lineage (like two closely related koi from a dealer who
specializes in that variety), the patterns of the offspring are
impossible to predict. So you can breed for a red and white
Kohaku; you just can’t breed for a heart-maruten on the head
or for zigzag placement of the red along the body.
Pattern, alas, doesn’t pass down from parent to offspring. You
can’t tell what colors are going to pop out until you have the
growing fry in front of you. So what do you do? Start with
strong, well-shaped, and well-colored adults of the same vari-
ety and hope for some surprises — which, given 5,000 varia-
tions, you’re apt to get.
Don’t let the unpredictability aspect throw you. It’s part of the fun
of breeding koi. The market for a breeder’s affordable, handsome
koi is much larger than the market for expensive offspring of
Nishikigoi.
Chapter 14: Breeding Koi 219

Preparing for the Dirty Deed
Koi are prolific breeders and are, as a species, well adjusted to 
captive life. This does not mean, however, that you can simply put
two fish of opposite sex together, sit back, and wait for babies.
(Although sometimes — especially in large, outdoor ponds — this
is exactly what seems to happen.) If you (and your koi!) are to be
successful, you need to plan carefully. Be sure that you have the
time, patience, and space for this complex but rewarding endeavor.
The season for breeding usually begins in February and continues
until May, depending on when the water temperature reaches 68
degrees F and when the fish (including the male) become more
active and begin to feed. Because exact breeding times vary from
place to place, season to season, and even among individual fish,
have your breeding tank up and running at least two weeks before
the earliest possible beginning of the local breeding season.
Formal breeding operations know how to eliminate as many of the
variables as possible. But even as a newbie, you can minimize your
challenges by making sure
 Your koi are as healthy as possible
 The breeding site is easy to monitor
 You use an easy method for changing the water
 You have enough room to move the adult koi in and out 
as necessary
Gathering the necessary tools
To help your koi successfully enter their parenting stage, some
advance setup is necessary on your part. This section walks you
through the details of the tanks and their essentials to make the
breeding process as predictable and smooth as possible.
Selecting the breeding tank or pond
Most koi breeders set up one or more breeding ponds indoors 
or outdoors, depending on the springtime temperatures and the
available space. Because the breeding tank often becomes a nurs-
ery after breeding (see “Setting up the nursery tank” in the next
section), indoor tanks or ponds tend to be easier.
Polyethylene stock watering tanks or show tanks make good breed-
ing tanks for koi. (Stock tanks are available from livestock/farm
supply stores, and show tanks are sold in pet stores or pond supply
stores.) Look for one that’s about 200 gallons. This size (at least 4 x 4
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
220

x 2 feet) provides enough room for the female for a month or two
before fertilization, then the female, male, and spawning brushes
(for the less-than-12 hours for egg deposition and fertilization), and
then the 2,000-plus fry.
Selecting the hospital tank
A second tank serves as a hospital for the female so she can rest
up for a week or two after laying her eggs. A stock watering tank 
or show tank of at least 200 gallons will suffice. See Chapter 10 for
details concerning this enclosure.
Supplies needed for each tank
Now that you have the tanks, they’ll need to function just like your
pond. So each tank needs its own
 Water pump
 Filter
 Air pump
 Airstones: Airstones connect to the pump and are made of a
porous material. They diffuse air from the pump so it rises to
the surface as a fine mist of bubbles. These bubbles disturb the
water’s surface and cause oxygen to be mixed into the water.
 Heater
 Net covering
 Spawning brushes: Spawning brushes are meant to imitate
plants, the usual spawning site for koi.
You can also use slender, smooth, tree branches (willows are
a good, pliable choice) that you tie together at their ends and
place into the tank. (If you use live branches, first wash them
in soapy water, then rinse them, dip them into a solution of 10
percent bleach, and re-rinse to remove traces of insecticides
and pollutants.)
Chapter 10 has more info on these supplies. Note: When you total
them up, the supplies can get a little pricey. Consider checking out
Amazon.com for used supplies to save on your setup investment.
Getting the breeding grounds 
ready for showtime
Before the weather warms, you need to prepare for the coming
breeding season. As we mention earlier in this chapter, the onset 
of the fish’s interest in reproduction is subject to many variables.
Chapter 14: Breeding Koi 221

Your best guides are local koi-keepers who’ve been successful in
breeding their fish.
Setting up the breeding tank
Reduce the water in the tank to expose about a foot of the tank
sides; add airstones to agitate the water.
Place the spawning brushes in the water (they can float freely),
and introduce the female. She’ll likely nose about the tank for a
while as she explores this new environment.
Setting up the nursery tank
The nursery (or incubator) tank should be up and running by the
time the adults are ready for breeding. Keep it filled to about 6
inches below the lip so the fry can’t jump out.
Add filtration and airstones. If you locate the nursery tank out-
doors, you can simply put it online with the same filtration system
as your koi pond. This step assures that the tanks are the same pH
and temperature. Use an air pump to power up the airstones. As an
alternative, you can use the breeding tank as a nursery tank.
Casting the stars of the show
In the excitement of your first breeding success, don’t neglect to plan
for the future. Although you can’t imagine forgetting even one aspect
of the event, be assured that time will blur the details. Keeping accu-
rate records allows you to analyze and refine your methods in the
future and can add to your overall understanding of this adventure.
Keep breeding records on your koi, even if the offspring seem only
slightly better than average. Anyone who obtains one of your off-
spring and decides to breed his own koi will appreciate a copy of
the lineage, if only to get an idea of possible dominant and reces-
sive genes.
In all cases, keep photos with each record unless you have only a
few, easily identified adults (in which case you can describe each
accurately). By taking photos every six months (and labeling them!),
you can easily provide a record of your koi’s color development.
Telling the sexes apart
Adult koi are fairly easy to sex from the body shape alone. The
females are plumper than the males, who look rather streamlined
in comparison. Adult females also have smaller pectoral fins. But
for younger koi, you have to rely on more subtle clues.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
222

When breeding season starts in spring to early summer, the males
(even as small as 5 or 6 inches long) develop a pebbly forward edge
on their pectoral fins. The forward edge of a small female’s pectoral
fin is smooth. Although you can feel the difference with your finger,
we’ve heard of koi fanciers whose sense of touch has dimmed, so
they use their tongue to feel the pectoral fins. (Trust us; you don’t
have to do this.)
Females also tend to have larger, rounder pectoral fins than the
males. (See Figure 14-1 for a visual of the differences between 
the sexes.)
Choosing the optimal fish
For breeding purposes, select adults on the basis of color, body
shape, finnage, and scales. Fish are judged from above (no, not
that kind of Above — from the tops of their bodies), so select koi
that are prettiest from the top.
 Number of each sex: You can use just one or more males per
female. (We talk about a single male in these instructions so
you know what the young from a particular pairing will look
like.) Many breeders use two or three males per female on the
theory that competition makes the breeding more intense.
 Age: Select females that are 3 years old or older, although par-
ticularly robust females may successfully breed at age 2 or so.
Males should be at least 2 years old, preferably 3, and they
have no upper age limit for breeding.
• Females need to be healthy and fully mature to endure
the rigors of egg laying and to produce vigorous young.
If you have any concerns in this regard, wait until your
koi is 4 years old before pairing her with a male.
Because breeding takes more out of a female, the oldest
practical age for a female breeder is 5 to 8 years.
• Males that are 3 years old or older are better able to joust
with other males during breeding and not get damaged.
They’re also stronger than a smaller koi and better able to
position themselves over the eggs to fertilize them.
One breeder uses a male estimated to be 20 years old
because he throws great babies.
 Size: Larger females can better tolerate the battering process
involved with spawning, and they can produce more eggs.
Although your first response may be, “Who in the world needs
more than 50,000 fertilized eggs?” these eggs are also larger
than those produced by a smaller female.
Chapter 14: Breeding Koi 223

Larger eggs have larger yolks, which means larger fry and
more nourishment for the fry in the first days after hatching.
In addition, bigger fry can switch to a commercial diet earlier
than small fry, which means they grow faster than the fry that
must live off their yolk longer.
Grooming your koi 
for the rendezvous
Koi breeding is triggered by the lengthening photoperiod (the
longer days in spring) and the warmer water temperatures (70
degrees is a good marker). Note: The Japanese believe that a full
moon triggers egg laying, which may give you an indication of
when to expect spawning.
Frequently breeders take the chosen female out of the pond in
January and place her in the breeding tank to begin feeding and
building up body weight.
Figure 14-1: The difference between a male koi (a) and a female koi (b).
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
224

If your tank is indoors, be sure the room has a natural photoperiod.
You can add timers to the lights to mimic normal, increasing day
lengths; this trick helps nudge the female toward breeding readiness.
The male you’ve selected can stay outside in the pond (like a cold
shower, only different) until the weather warms a bit.
Getting Down to Business
As is true for most fishes, koi engage in specific, if sometimes
subtle, behaviors that signal their readiness to breed. If you want
to recognize these and plan appropriately, you need to tune into
your koi’s normal behaviors. By carefully observing your fish over
time, you can easily note changes that may indicate the onset of
breeding behavior.
Beginning the breeding
Your first clue that egg laying is imminent is when the female
begins to nose around the spawning mat and any other possible
egg-deposition sites. She will be followed by the attentive and
eager male(s), who is willing to do his part and fertilize any eggs
the female may wish to deposit. At this point you can move the
female to the breeding tank.
About sunset of the same day, place the male in the tank with the
female, making sure to stretch the netting over the top of the tank.
Allow the fish to stay together through the night. The entire
process should take about four hours. Eggs are usually laid in 
the morning, just before sunrise.
Stay in the same room for a time in case the male gets too aggres-
sive toward the female, in which case you can remove him and
substitute another male. Please note that this is a difficult call —
especially for a novice — because normal mating behavior can
seem pretty rough to the uninitiated. If at all possible, join a local
koi club and try to observe breeding at a member’s pond so you
know what to expect. The male’s presence may inspire the female
to spend more time exploring the spawning brushes. This is
normal behavior and requires no action on your part.
Letting your koi have at it
As the time of actual egg laying approaches, your koi exhibit a
series of behaviors designed to synchronize the activities of both
Chapter 14: Breeding Koi 225

parents. Because fertilization is external, both male and female
need to be in the same frame of mind if breeding is to be successful.
1. As she prepares to release her eggs, the female releases a
signal pheromone (the sexy scent) that excites the male.
2. He then wrestles with the female, head-butting her, nip-
ping her, and shoving her with his body as he pushes her
toward the spawning brushes.
Her fins may be damaged in the process and she may lose
scales or even flesh to the male’s bites. The netting you use
to cover the tank prevents both koi from leaping or being
shoved out of the tank.
3. Encouraged by the head-butts from the male, the female
spews eggs from her vent.
The eggs are coated with a sticky mucous so they stick to
the brushes and sides of the tank.
4. The male, further signaled by the pheromone, releases
his sperm (also called milt).
The milt, which looks like a milky haze in the water, is wafted
by water currents over the eggs. The sperm enters each egg
through a small pore called a micropyle. After fertilization,
the micropyle closes.
5. After she lays the first batch of eggs, the female pauses
and snacks on a few eggs. The male does the same.
Then the female lays more eggs, the male nudging her as
she does so, and he releases more sperm. They pause to
snack on eggs, she lays more eggs, the male jostles her and
fertilizes the eggs, then they pause to snack . . . and so on
until she has released her entire supply.
The faster the eggs are laid, the faster they can be fertilized
and the male can leave to become less obvious. Even when
all the female’s eggs have been laid, the male continues to
butt her in an exploratory way.
6. When she’s too tired to respond, he turns and begins
eating the eggs. At this point, you can remove him so he
can start handing out cigars to the guys in the pond.
Reaping Your Reward: Parenting
the Eggs Till They Hatch
Egg laying is an important milestone, but this is no time for you 
to sit back and relax. The care you give to the adults and the eggs
from this point on greatly influences the future of the clutch.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
226

In the beginning . . .
This is a busy time for the eggs and for you, the proud, new
breeder. Do the following on Day 1:
1. Make sure the filter is working in the nursery tank and
double-check your water:
• Chemistry levels must be within acceptable limits.
• The water temperature should be about the same
temperature in the breeding and nursery tanks.
2. When the female has finished laying, lift the spawning
mats in a net and move them into your nursery tank.
(You’re probably going to see lots of eggs; females gener-
ally lay from 20,000 to 50,000.) As an alternative, leave the
eggs in the breeding tank and simply remove the adults.
3. Move the female to the hospital tank (see “Selecting the
hospital tank” earlier in this chapter). As always, take
great care in transporting both the male and female.
4. Check the ammonia level in the nursery tank shortly
after adding the eggs.
The protein from the eggs and the sperm may cause the
ammonia level to jump.
5. If the ammonia readings merit it (ideally, you’re aiming for
a reading of zero), do a very slow partial water change (20
to 30 percent over an hour), or use a product like AmQuel
Plus to reduce the ammonia levels.
At this point the breeding tank water has a slight color or
cast to it and a slight but distinct smell.
6. Slowly add water from your pond at the top and siphon
out water from the bottom.
Keep the flow rates equal so the water level doesn’t drop
and expose any of the eggs to air.
The water change helps with the odor problem, and the
odor will dissipate over time.
7. Position the airstones to create a gentle current in the
tank by distributing the stones evenly in the tank. The
water filter should be off.
8. Sit back for a minute and admire the tank.
The eggs are scattered on the sides and bottom and on the
spawning brushes and are quite visible, looking a little like
pearl tapioca. In about two weeks, you’re going to have a
bunch of baby koi (and less time to sit!).
Chapter 14: Breeding Koi 227

Because you aren’t feeding any fish yet, the water quality should
remain stable. A fine growth of green algae in the bin is a reason for
joy, not despair, because the algae and the microscopic protozoans
it harbors will be eaten by the tiny fry.
Moving on up
The first home for your hatchling koi will be the breeding tank or
bin where they were conceived. This section walks you through
your first six days as a koi breeder — when your progeny transi-
tion from fertilized egg to showing their first signs of life.
In a day or two, the eggs that aren’t fertile turn white (and then
develop a fuzzy fungus coat). The fertile eggs are clear except for
two very small dots per egg, which are the eyes of the soon-to-
hatch koi.
For the next few days:
 Keep the airstones fizzing.
 Siphon out or net out the unfertilized eggs.
Six days later, hocus-pocus: A lot of tiny, 1⁄4-inch-long fry are jiggling
about in the nursery. They have a bit of residual yolk, so they don’t
need feeding this first day.
If you have a high hatch rate and you’re overwhelmed by the sheer
numbers of fry pulsing through the tank, make your first cull (see
Chapter 15) with these steps:
1. Make a couple of passes through the fry with a fine 
fish net.
2. Discard the fry inside the net.
Cover the bin or tank containing your new fish with bird netting if
there’s any chance of bird predation on your young koi. As small as
they are and as many as there are, a heron or egret may find a sam-
pling worthwhile.
When the fish get to be 1 inch or longer, your neighborhood rac-
coons may stop by one evening. Raccoons are quite resourceful
animals and are not thwarted by bird netting. If you expect to run
into trouble with raccoons, keep your young koi in a container that
can be fitted with a tightly locked cover.

Low-Maintenance Breeding: 
The All-Natural Love Pond
You don’t have to go full-tilt to breed your koi; the second way is to
let nature take its course (either by simply leaving your koi to their
own devices or by furnishing a habitat that’s suitable for baby koi
making).
If you let nature take its course, be prepared to accept a tremendous
attrition rate because of egg predation by adults and the spread of
fungus from infertile to fertile eggs. Naturally, the outcomes of such
breedings vary widely from pond to pond and season to season. One
koi-keeper we know has only three or four new young koi in her pond
every year as a result of leaving the adults to their own devices.
Sectioning off the in-pond 
romping grounds
If letting your koi enjoy free love just isn’t your thing, but you don’t
want to hassle with the breeding tanks and such, you can section
off part of your pond and create a nursery there. This nursery
serves to confine the breeding adults to one area of the pond for a
time so the eggs are in one location and therefore easily relocated.
To create a nursery, follow these steps:
1. Start by digging out that seine net you used last year to
round up your koi for their winter pond and the spawning
brushes you bought at the koi conference you attended.
2. Use the seine to confine the female and one or maybe
two males to one end of the pond, and add the spawning
brushes to that end of the pond.
3. Turn off the filter and the foam fractionator for a couple
of hours.
This step helps the eggs stick to the spawning brushes
instead of floating out of the spawning end of the pond.
4. After courtship and spawning ends, use a net to move the
egg-laden brushes to your nursery tank. Turn the pond
filter back on, and return the male(s) to the main part of
the pond after a few hours.
Chapter 14: Breeding Koi 229

By turning on the filter and the fractionator before you put
the breeding male back into the main part of the pond, you
avoid problems. The other male koi, invigorated by the
scent of the female’s pheromones in the water and on the
male, get confused. They pummel the newly returned male
to try to get him to release eggs. If the filtration systems
run for an hour or so before you release the breeding
males, most of the scent dissipates or is filtered out.
5. Leave the female by herself in the spawning end for a
few days or move her to a hospital tank with very high
water quality for half a day or a full day. See “Selecting
the hospital tank” earlier in this chapter for more about
this tank.
This break lets her rest from egg laying and the enthusias-
tic attention of the males.
Preparing your pond for babies
Can you have a pond that’s breeding- and baby-koi-friendly without 
a lot of extra equipment and effort? In a word, yes. You can make a
few accommodations to help ensure the survival of some fry. They
simply need food and shelter, so you need to provide a substrate
(site) for egg deposition and hiding spots for the koi after they hatch.
To provide egg-deposition sites and shelter for the fry, position
spawning brushes or mats or slender tree branches on the floor 
of the pond. Tie either device to a line that extends over the pond
edge and anchor it to a brick or a rock. The line allows for easy
retrieval after the young are large enough to fend for themselves.
The tiny koi don’t need much space, but they’re vulnerable to 
predation. Adult koi and such unwelcome visitors as predacious
aquatic insects relish tiny fry, and raccoons and wading birds will
consume those that survive and grow larger.
To provide a hiding area for the baby koi, plant ornamental grasses
or pond-side plants that overhang the edge of the pond. If the pond
has no place near the edge for living plants, tie leafy plastic plants
together and hang them at the pond’s edge with a line that’s
anchored by a rock. If the pond’s edge is tiled, try looping the 
line around small suction cups stuck to the tile.

W
hat can be cuter and more compelling than a group of 3-
inch koi? At that size, they have a hint of the grown-up koi
within. If you choose to buy them at this size, they aren’t expen-
sive. All you need to do is keep them alive over a winter or two
until you can see how their color develops and their body shapes
up. Almost anyone can raise 3-inch koi.
If you have the space and the time, raising young koi can be a lot 
of fun, if only for seeing how they color, recolor, and shape up.
And that’s what this chapter is about — how to raise young koi,
what to feed them, how to cull them (eliminate the weak ones), 
and finally, how to evaluate the success of your breeding program.
In a nutshell — or rather, in an air bubble — raising your koi is fun,
but it’s also a lot of work and expense. (The food for the first two
months runs about $300.) The task also requires that you cull over
99 percent of the young (although with 30,000 fertile koi eggs, you
quickly realize that housing and raising even 200 young koi is a real
commitment).
Feeding Fry
The appetites of older koi are easy to satisfy. However, newly
hatched fry have very specific nutritional requirements and,
because of their tiny mouths, their food must be in a size that 
they can handle. The foods in Table 15-1 meet their needs.

Fry live on their retained yolk for the first 24 hours after they
hatch, but after that, their survival depends on you. You need 
to tread the fine line between providing enough food and not 
polluting the tank (because you can’t provide filtration).
The newly hatched koi need liquid or a suspended-particle food 
for the first day or so of life because they have tiny mouths. After a
couple of days of this fine dining, the young are on a growth curve
and are able to eat progressively larger, nonliquid foods.
Be sure you have all the necessary foods on hand when your fry
hatch. You may not need all of them, but stock some of each so you
can switch to another type if you run out of one food or if your fry no
longer like one of them. The amounts in Table 15-1 are a good place
to start, and you can tailor this list to fit your specific hatch size after
you have some experience under your belt. If buying the different
foods seems like a hassle, look for starter baby-koi food kits.
Foods for baby koi fall into three categories:
 Commercial foods: Those specifically created for baby fish,
(such as liquid fry food) or foods for larger fish (such as
blended freeze-dried krill) that you modify to be acceptable 
to tiny koi
 Live foods: Food such as baby brine shrimp that can be
hatched from commercially available eggs
 Foods from your refrigerator: Foods that are part of a human
diet such as hard-boiled eggs

A fry’s feeding schedule
Growing fish need quite a lot of food, but overfeeding results in
leftovers that pollute the water. Although commercial koi foods 
are marketed as a complete, balanced diet, generally the widest
variety of food as possible is safer.
The first month
During the first month, you want to feed your koi four times per
day. The liquid food dissolves in the water and is available to the
koi for some time after you introduce it.
Monitor your koi during feeding and fine-tune the amounts of solid
food that they need. If you find leftovers at the next feeding, cut
back on your volume (but watch that you don’t underfeed; large
numbers of weak or dead fry are a sure clue). Only time and experi-
ence will help you gauge the right formula.
Add the new dietary items to each of the four feedings. Following
are some tips and milestones for this first month:
 For Day 1, offer liquid fry food, one tube at a time. Simply
squeeze the liquid food from its tube into the water. On 
this first day, also set up your brine shrimp hatchery. The
specifics of setting up the brine shrimp hatchery vary from
model to model, but all come with instructions and are simple
to operate. Then again, you can use the production-line
method we describe later in “Hatching brine shrimp.”
 On Days 2 and 3, continue to feed the liquid fry food, increasing
each feeding to two tubes per feeding. Once a day, add a netful
of newly hatched brine shrimp (see the section, “Hatching
brine shrimp” later in this chapter). The koi prefer the live
brine shrimp to all other foods, so leftovers are rarely a prob-
lem. Generally, you’re safe in feeding the daily output of your
hatchery to your koi.
 After a day or two, your koi begin to associate human pres-
ence with food, and they wriggle to the surface of the water
when you approach.
Chapter 15: The Small Fry: Bringing Up Baby Koi 233

 For Days 4 and 5, continue with the liquid fry diet and newly
hatched brine shrimp. Add 1⁄4 cup of egg yolk slurry (see the
nearby sidebar, “Making egg yolk slurry” for the recipe).
 For Days 6 and 7, continue the diet and add the powdered 
fry food.
 During Week 2, add in frozen or fresh daphnia and koi pellets
that you’ve reduced to a powder with a blender, a chopper, or
a rolling pin.
 At the end of Week 2, discontinue the egg slurry and the liquid
fry food. Replace them with fish flake food and ground krill
(tiny dried shrimp).
 Continue with this dietary mix for the rest of the first month.
At the end of this month, the young should be 3⁄4 to 1 inch long. They
are strong enough to swim against a filter current. Take these steps:
1. Turn on the filtration system.
2. Transfer half of the baby koi into a second incubator bin
and make sure the filter and airstones are working in this
second unit.
By splitting up the fish, you ensure better water quality and
larger, more robust fish (crowding inhibits growth).
3. Cull your young koi (see “Culling: It Ain’t Easy, but
Somebody Has To Do It,” later in this chapter).
As the koi increase in size, you can be a bit more selective in
your culling — removing those that are weak or malformed,
for example.
You may see some dramatic differences in the size of your young
koi, even at the end of the first month. Some are cannibalistic, eating
their smaller brethren. Net out these big pigs — discarding them or
raising them separately — and continue this size-segregation netting
monthly.
The second month
During the second month, continue feeding your fry four times per
day. In general, feed as much as the fish can eat in about five min-
utes, but make sure that all fry are actively feeding during that
time. If not, you’ll need to spend more time feeding them, or you
can separate the larger fish. You can feed every food item in the
following list at each feeding to ensure that all the koi have a shot
at getting a balanced diet:
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
234

 Continue with the powered koi pellets.
 Replace the fresh brine shrimp with frozen (the shrimp in the
frozen blocks are adult and much larger, but they’re easy to
tear apart and consume).
 Add frozen daphnia to the diet.
 Depending on what brand of powdered fry diet you’re using,
you may be able to switch to a larger particle within that brand.
 Feed baby-koi sinking pellets once daily.
At the end of the second month, your young koi should be 1 to 2
inches long.
The third month
During the third month, you can decrease the feedings to three
times a day (stay with an amount per feeding that they’ll consume
within five minutes or so) with the following changes:
 Offer the baby-koi pellets, powdered adult-koi pellets, and
flake fish food.
 Cut the frozen daphnia to once a day.
Chapter 15: The Small Fry: Bringing Up Baby Koi 235
Making egg yolk slurry
Peel three hard-boiled eggs and separate the yolks. Mash the yolks to a paste with
a fork and add water to the yolks, starting with 1⁄2 cup per yolk. You want the egg yolk
soup to be liquid enough to use in a plastic squirt bottle (like a well-rinsed mustard
or marinade bottle) or a turkey baster (nothing in the kitchen is sacred when you’re
raising baby koi!). Store the egg yolk slurry in your refrigerator between feedings.
Squirt a line of yolk slurry across the surface of the water in your baby koi bin, and
watch the babies’ response.
Because the fry are almost transparent when they hatch, you can see the yolk in
their stomachs after they’ve eaten.
Note: Egg yolk is almost pure protein, which, if uneaten, rapidly fouls the water and
puts the koi at risk. Don’t dump the slurry in, willy-nilly. Feed a small amount at a time,
watching carefully that the fry consume all of it. You can continue adding more, bit by
bit, until the fish begin to lose interest. The standard rule is to feed what they can con-
sume in five minutes or so, but adjust this to fit your specific situation. For example, you
may have many nervous, slow feeders or many larger individuals that hog all the food.

Check the protein content of any food you offer your koi babies.
They grow quickly and their protein content requirements are
higher than those of the adults. Look for foods with about 40 per-
cent protein content. Increase the protein content in your baby-koi
diet if you see whirling (koi positioned head up, tail down in the
water and turning in circles) or if cannibalism is rampant.
Monitor the water-quality numbers to make sure your protein
skimmer and filter are taking care of the increased protein in the
water. Even with the filters going, you need to make a 10 percent
water change every week and remove the detritus on the bottom
of the bin.
You can remove the detritus by one of the following methods:
 Sweep it toward the filter intake at the bottom of the bin.
 Siphon it up with a commercially available siphon. Most models
come equipped with a rubber ball that is squeezed to fill the
plastic siphon tube with water. Take care not to suck up any fry,
and run the siphoned water through a net just to be sure.
Uneaten egg yolk contributes to the gray-green sludge on the
bottom of your tank. This material sticks to the bottom and is
difficult to dislodge with a net, so siphoning is the only way to
remove it. Use a tall bucket to collect the garbage.
When you’re done siphoning, net out any baby koi from the
bucket and return them to their nursery.
Flush the sludge into your wastewater system.
Hatching brine shrimp
Freshly hatched brine shrimp are minute enough even for koi fry.
You can buy them frozen — a very expensive approach when talk-
ing about thousands of fry — or you can raise them.
Hatching brine shrimp is almost a mechanical process: Mix salt,
water, brine shrimp eggs, and an airstone. Put a light overhead 
and wait 24 hours.
The best method for hatching brine is to have a production line.
Set your production line up on a water-safe tabletop in your utility
room, garage, or a protected spot on your porch. The table needs
to be large enough for six water pitchers plus a bit of work space.
You also need lighting for the area 24 hours a day.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
236

You need these supplies:
 Six plastic 1-gallon pitchers
 30 pounds of rock salt
 40 ounces of brine shrimp eggs
 An air pump and enough valves and aquarium tubing to 
connect the pump to all six pitchers
Begin hatching three pitchers at a time using the following steps:
1. Put 2 1⁄2 tablespoons of rock salt in a pitcher.
2. Add water from your pond to within 2 inches of the top.
3. Add a tablespoon of brine shrimp eggs and stir to 
dissolve the salt and wet the eggs.
4. Put the pitcher on the left side of your table and add 
an airstone.
5. Follow Steps 1 through 4 for two more pitchers and set
them along the left side of the table.
The next day, set up the rest of the water pitchers and put them on
the right side of the table.
The baby shrimp, known as naupli, will hatch in 24 hours at 85
degrees F. (They take two to three days at lower temperatures, but
keep them at a minimum of 76 degrees.) When the shrimp in the
pitchers on the left side hatch, you have three days of baby brine
shrimp. Pour the contents of one pitcher from the left side of the
table through a fine fish net (this water can be discarded) and empty
the net into your koi tank as one of the daily feedings. You can set up
the pitcher with rock salt and a new dose of eggs, or you can wait
until you’ve emptied all three pitchers and set them all up at once.
Culling: It Ain’t Easy, but
Somebody Has To Do It
You have a lot of tiny koi when the eggs hatch, but the numbers
diminish on their own, even with expert husbandry. (Some just
seem to vanish, some get eaten by others, and some leap out of the
tank.) But you’re still looking at lots of baby fish. At one-month
intervals for the first three months, cull (euthanize unwanted fish
or find new homes for them) your baby fish.
Chapter 15: The Small Fry: Bringing Up Baby Koi 237

Although culling may sound cruel at first, reducing the number of
baby fish puts the nose-count down to a manageable level, work-
wise for you, survival-wise for the fish left in your tank, and future-
wise for trades or sales. The fewer fish you have to trade or sell,
the more valuable each fish becomes.
Most breeders discard the culled fish, but other breeders dry
them, grind them up, and feed them to the koi. That’s a little grisly
for our blood. If you don’t want the young koi to die, at least not at
your hands, ask a local pet store manager whether she’s interested
in feeder fish. Instead of asking for cash for these fish, which the
pet store may sell at ten-for-a-buck, see whether you can trade
them for fish food.
What to cull
After the fish are showing color (about the end of the second month),
you can cull for the colors you want. You may also wish to remove
aggressive fry and those that are weak, stunted, or deformed.
If you’re breeding for Sanke (see Chapter 2 for a description of the
various color morphs), look at the red-white-black koi in your tank.
Discard the following Sanke:
 Those without red on their head.
 Those with red in the fins.
 Those that are more than one-third black — balance between
red, white, and black is important for Sanke.
Also remember the following guidelines:
 Cull for solid colors; remove any solid whites or oranges.
 Keep all solid blacks because they may become Showa, the
black koi with red and white markings. (On Showa, the red
markings appear later, taking one to three years to develop.)
 Keep a young white koi that has red anywhere on its head
because it may develop into a quality Tancho. (Large red mark-
ings on the head tend to shrink in size as the fish matures.)
A good Tancho (the white koi with the red marking on the top
of the head) has a rounded topknot (the colored area on the
top of the head).
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
238

How much to cull
Whenever you cull, you want to seriously reduce your baby fish
inventory.
The following numbers are guidelines that generations of koi-keepers
and breeders have used:
 The first month, remove and discard 85 percent of your fish.
 The second month, remove and discard 80 percent.
 The third month, remove and discard 65 percent.
If you started with 5,000 fry, at the end of three months you’ll have 52
healthy, lively, young koi that are 3 to 4 inches long. That’s still a lot
of fish. However, if you started with 20,000 fry and culled for three
months, you’ll have 210 fish, all of which eat, churn out ammonia,
and grow about an inch a month. That’s too many fish. Keep culling
until you have a number that you can manage properly, given your
constraints of time and space.
There’s nothing wrong with being very selective about which koi
you save; the singular purpose behind this entire adventure is to
end up with a few very good koi.
Evaluating Your Young Koi
Deciding which fish to cull or show is a tricky process that becomes
easier with experience. When your fish get large enough to seriously
evaluate, keep this backwards rule of koi-judging in mind: Koi judges
don’t look for what makes a fish pretty; they look for the flaws, or
rather the absence of flaws. Check out the sidebar “How the pros
breed (and cull) their fish” for more about this refined koi selection.
An experienced koi breeder knows all about potential flaws and
how to pick out the fish with the fewest flaws. Because this
process is a bit more difficult for a beginner, follow these steps:
1. Start with body shape.
A koi with a long back and a wide head is a good koi.
2. Move out to the fins.
A koi’s pectoral fins should extend well away from the
body, with the rays fanned out.
3. Check out that skin!
Chapter 15: The Small Fry: Bringing Up Baby Koi 239

Any white skin should be bright and unsullied. Any colors
atop the white should be dense. The edges of markings
should be distinct, and the color of the markings should 
be intense.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
240
How the pros breed (and cull) their fish
Those who breed koi for a living have a more business-like approach to the process
because they’re selling lineage, not just pretty fish.
In Japan, breeding occurs in late summer. A female is placed in a spawning tank
with a male, and they’re both watched carefully. When the female koi begins to scat-
ter a few eggs, she’s removed from the spawning bin and anesthetized. She’s then
held over a stainless steel bowl and dry stripped (her abdomen is gently squeeze-
rubbed to strip her eggs into the bowl). These eggs are divided among a series of
bowls, depending on how many males have been selected to pair with this female.
(One male initiates egg laying, but several may actually contribute to fertilization.)
Each male is anesthetized, and while he’s out of it, his milt (semen) is removed
through his vent via pipette. The milt is mixed with Ringer’s solution, an isotonic solu-
tion that has the same salinity as fish blood, and each bowl is inoculated with one
male’s milt. The eggs are gently stirred. Fertilization occurs and the micropyle (the
opening in the egg’s membrane that allows for entry of the sperm) closes. The fer-
tilized eggs are placed on spawning grass or brushes in a hatching bin, one male-
female pairing per bin (so a few months down the road the breeder knows the
success of each pairing). Water quality in each hatching bin is monitored for the
next week and the infertile eggs are removed.
After the fry hatch, they go into mud ponds, a growing-out pond. For fry, a mud pond
is just 2 feet deep but may contain 44,000 gallons of water. A mud pond that large can
hold 180,000 to 200,000 fry, the progeny from 6 to 15 select pairings. The young are
fed infusoria (protozoans raised in cultures of hay and water), powdered food, and
daphnia twice a day. At the end of the first month, the fish are from 3⁄4 to 1 inch long
and the first culling occurs.
The first cull simply nets out and discards 85 percent of the fry from the water. Some
Japanese breeders dry the discarded fish, grind them up, and feed them to their brethren.
A month later, the second culling removes 80 percent of the now 2-inch-long koi.
At the end of the third month, another culling removes 65 percent of the remaining
koi. What had been 180,000 fry are now 1,890, and they’re 3 to 4 inches long.
Half of these koi are sold on the market. The remaining 945 koi are kept over the
winter. The following summer, half of these almost-yearlings are sold.
The remaining 472 go back into a mud pond (one deeper than their first mud pond)
for the winter. That second summer, the koi are 12 to 14 inches long, and they have
a ready market waiting for them. Just for the record, 0.2 percent, or one-fifth of a per-
cent, of the hatched fry stay with the breeder through two winters.

 Variety is the spice: Locating the shows
 Ready, set, go: Entering a competition
 Just for the fun of it: No koi, no pressure
 Stepping into the organizer’s role: Your own koi show
S
howing koi isn’t for everyone. Some people like their koi just
the way they are and have no desire to see how their treasures
compare to others. But other koi-keepers may just be more curious
to see how their fish measure up. Maybe they want to see whether
their wonderful little Bekko (the one they snatched from their pond-
dealer’s $19.95 tank) is growing into a very good Bekko. Or maybe
they like trying to predict the judges’ Grand Champion selection.
Then again, maybe they hope that the dealer who had the gorgeous
Ogon last year will bring in a Yamabuki Ogon this year. Or maybe
they just like to travel a couple of times a month to meet a bunch 
of new friends with similar interests.
Koi shows accomplish two goals: They allow individuals to enter
their prized koi in competition, and they allow vendors to reach a
very select market with their koi supplies, books, and yes, koi for
sale. So, even if you aren’t up to primping your fish for judging, a
koi show still has a lot to offer you.
In this chapter, you discover the ins and outs of koi shows — how
they operate, what to expect, and even how to enter your own fish.

Showing Your Koi — Why Bother?
Of course, the prospect of winning a title or trophy has great
appeal in any contest setting, but koi shows have so much more to
offer than just awards. In terms of real pleasures and value, every
participant at a koi show, whether you compete or not, comes out
a winner.
You win gold in terms of knowledge
In addition to putting miles on your car and ending those weekends
of working in the yard, koi shows teach you about koi. You discover
myriad facts about koi-keeping and koi-judging. For example:
 Inside tips on practical issues: You discover more than you
thought you ever could at the seminars and workshops that
go along with koi shows. Typical sessions deal with setting 
up quarantine systems, operating a koi farm, and using salt
against koi disease. Sometimes these are coupled with trade
shows, where you can see and learn about new equipment,
foods, books, and the like.
 How koi are judged: By observing the judges and talking with
them and other hobbyists, you start to make sense of what is,
at first glance, a confusing process.
 The particulars about each judge: You find out what koi 
characteristics are most important (this varies from judge to
judge) — which judges, for example, look carefully at body
shape and which ones look at pattern balance.
 The reasons behind the results: Why competition is so tough
for Kohaku, for example.
You get to know your koi better
Showing koi that you’ve just purchased is a learning experience for
you and your fish. You can’t know ahead of time how well your koi
will deal with the stress of the show. For example:
 Some varieties of koi lose their color intensity when they’re
under stress.
 Some try to hide or splash about in an agitated manner.
 Some (like the Chagoi) are friendly koi that just like people;
nothing seems to stress them.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
242

Realistically speaking, you need to attend one or two shows before
you know how your new koi react to traveling and to the show
itself. Travel is stressful, and many koi just don’t deal well with it.
(Review Chapter 5 for tips on transporting fish to make the trip
less stressful on both of you.)
You can observe your koi carefully, both en route and at the show,
to decide whether the experience is worthwhile for you and your
fish. Particularly high-strung animals are best spared this ordeal.
Let the behavior of other koi and the advice of more experienced
people be your guide in making this decision.
You see what you’re up against 
and what’s in vogue
You need to see how different judges react to your new koi. You may
think that your Aka Muji, a nonmetallic red koi, is extraordinary. But
when three judges in a row pass it over, you have to face the fact that
you have a very nice, very ordinary koi. See “The judging process”
later in this chapter for more information concerning what the judges
are looking for.
When you’re at a show, look around to see what’s being shown. If
they seem to be the same old story, they probably are. Keep track
of the following factors:
 Variety: The long-time top varieties of koi are the Kohaku,
Showa, and Sanke, with the Ogon nudging in for fourth place.
 Other factors: Is there anything new in the way of color or
shape? Perhaps something that points the way to a future
trend?
 Size: No particular size is tops, mostly because koi tend to
grow into the next size group every year or every other year.
Finding a Show Near You 
(Or Even Far Away)
The Web site or newsletter of your local koi club is a good place to
start when searching for a local show. You can expand your search
by checking with one of the bigger clubs, such as the Mid-Atlantic
Koi Club (www.makc.com) or via a general Internet search. Koi mag-
azines also list upcoming shows, as do the newsletters of general
aquarium societies.
Chapter 16: Koi Shows: Your All-Access Pass to Koi Kichi-dom 243

Showing Off Your Pride and Joy
After you’ve decided to show your koi, you have a number of ques-
tions to consider. And personal experience tells us that you’ll enjoy
the experience more if you understand what’s expected of you and
how the process works in general.
Local and regional shows in particular tend to be restricted to 
hobbyists. As a result, people who make a living from koi (let us
pause for a minute to catch our breath from laughing — the idea of
making money from koi seems outlandish!) may not be allowed to
compete. They attend the shows as vendors only. If you’re in doubt
about your status, check the guidelines before you register for a
show to avoid any problems. You can also contact the show organ-
izer and ask about these limitations.
Registering for a show
If you decide to take the plunge and enter your Precious in a show,
you need to plan ahead. Some shows have an entry deadline sev-
eral days before the show dates. (This advance warning allows the
organizers time to provide enough show tanks for the competing
fish.) But the deadline for registration may be flexible; many shows
allow for walk-up (swim-up?) registration when show tank space is
still available. Bottom line: If the show’s important, don’t take that
kind of chance. Be sure you determine these and other limitations
from the show’s announcement information or organizers so you
can plan accordingly.
To get started in the registration process, consult the requirements
posted on the Web site or magazine advertisement that announces
the show. The show entry form includes
 Your contact information: Short and simple, just the way we
like it.
 Your show tank requirements: You reserve one or more show
tanks (6-foot or 8-foot) with the understanding that only your
fish will be in your tanks (to prevent disease transmission).
Generally, the show rules spell out the number of fish to be 
in each tank. Usually fish of each size class are assigned a 
certain number of points, and the tanks are designated to
hold a certain number of fish points. For example, fish of 16 
to 20 inches may be labeled as size 4 (4 points). So if a 6-foot-
long tank can hold 25 points of koi, you can put six koi, 16 to
20 inches each, in that tank.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
244

Most show organizers don’t require a head count ahead of
time. They leave the number of fish per tank up to you.
 Descriptions of your koi: Although rare, sometimes the
powers that be ask for the type and size of your koi.
You pay a registration fee (which can vary greatly from show to
show) when you submit the registration form.
Paperwork with the registration probably reminds you not to feed
your koi for at least three days before the show to keep the water
in the show tanks and vats as clean as possible. Koi don’t suffer
from fasting over the entire event, even if it’s several days.
A brief rundown of the affair
Most shows are weekend affairs with benching (setup) on Friday
and early Saturday. The process goes something like this:
1. A show official checks you in at the registration area and
you’re assigned a fish handler.
Please bring your own bowls and koi nets. Some onsite
equipment is available, but you’re wise to use your own 
for hygienic reasons.
2. The fish handler helps you move your fish to your assigned
show tank(s). After the bag(s) and tank temperatures have
equalized, the handler physically transfers your fish into
the tank(s).
The goal of the fish handler is to lift your koi out of the bag
and place it into the tank without transferring any of the
transport water to avoid spreading disease or parasites.
You can dispose of the used bags and transport water, 
but you may want to keep yours for the trip home if you
haven’t brought extra bags. (Hint: To avoid problems
because of ripped bags, bring along some extras.)
3. A contest official visually inspects your fish for disease.
Fish that exhibit any symptoms of disease are not allowed
into the show tank or vat.
4. Using your net and bowl, a member of the benching 
team bowls each of your koi to classify, measure, and
photograph it.
Your regular koi are measured from nose tip to tail-fin tip;
long fins and butterfly koi are measured from nose tip to
the base of the tail. See Table 16-1 for the group sizes.
Chapter 16: Koi Shows: Your All-Access Pass to Koi Kichi-dom 245

5. You take the completed benching form and digital photos
to the registration table to complete the entry process.
6. Judging begins Saturday morning. Depending upon 
the judges’ dispositions, and, of course, the number and
quality of the entries, this can be quite a tedious and pro-
tracted affair. Show officials generally announce awards
at a banquet on Saturday night.
7. Takedown begins on Sunday afternoon, usually no 
earlier than 3 p.m.
The sponsoring club usually supplies oxygen and fresh
water for bagging.

Surveying the many ways to win
Prizes range from ribbon rosettes to trophies, with no two shows
being identical in this regard. But koi shows do more than award
prizes for the most beautifully configured koi. They recognize
other categories including the best male, the most jumbo, and the
show director’s choice. Other awards are more lighthearted like
the most beautiful eyes, longest tail fin, or most unique.
Part of the reason for separating koi by type and size is to have
easily comparable fish. Some varieties don’t develop their full
range of colors until they near 12 inches, so comparing a 6-incher
to a 12-incher isn’t fair. And trying to compare a Koromo to a
Utsuri Mono is like the proverbial apples to oranges game. Having
lots of categories gives all competitors a better chance at winning.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
246

Shows are generally prejudiced in favor of larger fish, meaning a
36-inch koi is more apt to win over a 30-inch koi only by virtue of
size and age. However, larger fish are more difficult to transport,
and many koi competitors just don’t want to take a chance on
losing their elder koi.
The judging process
The evaluation of each koi variety has set criteria, but the process
is scarcely precise. For example, one judge may prefer the black on
a Sanke scattered over the body, but avoid the red. Another judge
may like a Sanke whose black is limited to four splotches that form
two opposing V’s over the back.
Although judges do adhere to the specific standards of each vari-
ety, they’re free to rely on their personal opinions as well. They
follow a procedure that includes the following checkpoints:
 Swimming style: The koi’s movements should appear grace-
ful, with the pectoral fins held out. Swimming should be a
smooth, fluid movement as opposed to a twisting motion.
 Fins: Any damage? If your koi’s fins were damaged during
transport, tell the judge so it won’t count against the fish.
Chapter 16: Koi Shows: Your All-Access Pass to Koi Kichi-dom 247
Taking a sneak peek at Japanese koi shows
In Japan, koi competitions group the fish by size and classification, meaning all the
size 2 Kohaku are together, and all the size 2 Utsuri Monos are together. Even though
clear digital photos are part of the registration process, every koi-keeper can easily
recognize his own fish.
The first Japanese point system to establish the value of a fish was fault-based:
Each koi started with 100 points and then lost points for body shape, pattern faults,
and color faults. In the 1980s the system switched to a positive approach: Points
are now awarded for notable characteristics. With this system, a fish with great
color can win over a fish with a good pattern, or a koi that swims with remarkable
grace can still have a high score in spite of its other faults.
Japanese shows are a great deal more formal than American shows, and this formal-
ity acknowledges the judges’ expertise by allowing them a great deal of leeway in select-
ing the finest koi. Judges use written ballots in selecting the show’s Grand Champion.
As part of their always-positive approach, Japanese judges announce the show’s
Grand Champion first and then the lower prizes. This order is the opposite of U.S.
shows, where they save the announcement of the Grand Champion for last.

 Barbels: Any missing?
 Body shape: Plump, Rubenesque females are more attractive
than slender males; body should be bilaterally symmetric.
 Colors: Deep, vibrant colors with distinct edges are preferable
to colors that overlap; balanced or pleasing patterns score
high, and a unique pattern on the head is a real plus.
The judges generally make their decisions on a consensus basis.
One person is usually designated as a head judge to resolve
impasses. The details of the actual decision-making process vary
widely from show to show and among the various judges. Individual
judges may give greater or lesser weight to certain factors, and the
effect of this is not at all clear cut. In fact, judging may be quite con-
fusing to the newcomer. But with experience, you can start to make
sense of certain (but not all!) aspects of the judging process.
Judges are willing to explain why they selected one koi over
another or which factors they found pleasing in a particular koi. 
Be sure to check the protocol (written and unwritten) concerning
these procedures. They differ from show to show, but they’re
always rooted in the formality and politeness of the hobby’s
Japanese origins.
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
248
Competing without actually showing up
Your koi can compete in shows and you never have to leave your home. How is this
possible? You let the breeder show your fish for you before you receive the fish. In
the world of koi, a breeder can show fish on behalf of the new owner if the new
owner hasn’t taken possession of the fish.
Consider this scenario: You go to Japan, buy a koi with promise, and leave it with the
breeder to mature for a year or so. During that time, the breeder enters your koi in
whatever show(s) he — or the two of you — chooses. When he ships the fish to
you, it arrives complete with show awards (or so you hope).
But after this prize-winning Ai Bekko crosses your threshold, the rules change. From
then on, you do the work. The rules read, “All fish must be the personal and private
property of the registrant.”
Sometimes the rules state that the show is not open to individuals who derive a sig-
nificant portion of their income from breeding koi or that the fish owner must attend
the show and sign the entry form. You can’t get around rules like these. These rules
prevent a professional koi-breeder from dragging out his zillion-dollar Sanke and
sweeping the awards. After all, the show is by hobbyists for hobbyists. A profes-
sional koi-breeder can easily make everyone feel like yesterday’s filter wash.

Respect the judges’ opinions; they’ve gone through a winnowing
process that requires years of koi-keeping experience, specialized
training with testing at the end, and recertification every four years.
For more information on judging, the Associated Koi Clubs of
America (AKCA) has a Web site that lets you try your hand at 
judging: www.akca.org/judging/judge.htm.
After the show: Packing 
up and heading out
After 3 p.m. on Sunday, the competitors and vendors pack up and
head home. You can get packing help from a member of the bench-
ing team if you don’t mind waiting, but most koi-keepers bag up
their own fish.
The general format of closing up follows these steps:
1. Use your koi net to bowl each of your fish and then pour
the fish into its own poly bag.
Place smaller koi together in one bag, but be careful not to
crowd them.
2. Carry your bags to the member of the benching team
who’s handling the oxygen.
She may be walking around, pulling a wheeled oxygen tank.
She’ll squash the bag down to remove excess air, top it off
with oxygen, then twist and seal the top with a rubber band.
With oxygen, your koi should be comfortable for 8 to 12
hours.
3. Place the sealed bags in their cardboard boxes and close
the tops.
In the meantime, the live fish vendors are delivering bagged, oxy-
genated, and boxed koi that the show participants have purchased.
(Because most vendors prefer payment at the time of sale and not
at the time of delivery, this delivery process goes smoothly.)
When you’re packed and ready to go, follow these guidelines to
safely bring your koi home sweet home:
1. Place the boxes in your car or van crosswise so the bags
lie perpendicular to the direction of travel.
When you stop or accelerate, your koi simply rock in their
bags instead of jamming their noses into the end of the bag.
Chapter 16: Koi Shows: Your All-Access Pass to Koi Kichi-dom 249

Don’t allow any box to remain in the sun in your car. Shade
it with a towel or jacket.
2. Open the box at home and place the bags in your pond so
temperatures can equalize.
Make certain that none of them are floating in the sun.
3. Open the bags after 20 minutes, wet your hands, and lift
your koi out of the bag for release into the pond.
Try not to spill any of the bag water into the pond; after
two days of being home to your koi, the water’s probably
not clean any more.
Attending a Show Just 
for Kicks and Giggles
Some shows include free (with your registration) workshops or 
lectures on Saturday and Sunday. The judging area is usually open
for viewing Saturday and Sunday, and more than half the fun of a
show comes from walking around and looking at the fish.
As the judges begin walking around and talking to each other
about the fish, protocol puts sort of an invisible shield around
them. Only show officials may talk to them or interrupt them. 
After the awards, judges are available for questions.
Vendor booths and the judging area are open to the public for
viewing on Saturday and Sunday.
Playing Host: Setting 
Up Your Own Show
Although shows at a set location are a long-standing tradition
among koi associations, other options are possible. Factors such
as logistics, finances, or the personal situations of members may
necessitate creative thinking. The house-to-house show is an ideal
alternative and often brings together koi enthusiasts who aren’t
able to view each other’s fish any other way.
House-to-house shows
In house-to-house shows, the judges and the crowd travel from
house to house to see the competing fish in their own habitat. 
This type of show works well when
Part IV: The Big Leagues: Koi Breeding and Showing 
250

 Showing off your pond is part of the fun.
 It’s the dead of winter and everyone has heated indoor ponds
(for more on setting up your own indoor pond, see Chapter 10).
However, this show is harder for the judges because they have to
remember the strong points of one koi three houses back and the
details on the koi’s chin from the first house. Most judges use a
point system or digital photos to help even out the judging process.
Because of their unique characteristics, these shows are most
easily arranged among people who live within a relatively small
area (a couple of miles) and who are comfortable in opening up
their homes to other folks. Small, local koi associations are an ideal
format for organizing house-to-house shows, either by word of
mouth or through the organization’s newsletter.
Regional shows
You can sum up shows in one word, committees — and plenty of
them. A club or regional show requires so many finite tasks that
everyone can join in at a level that suits him best. A typical list of
committees includes
 Show site arrangements
 Show set up
 Publicity
 Hospitality
 Registration
 Show workers
 Judge arrangements
 Prizes/ribbons
 Fish handlers
 Site cleanup
When you’re trying to figure out how much work a show is, a 
helpful guideline is
 Half of the work is done before the show.
 One-fourth of the work is done during the show.
 One-fourth of the work is done after the show.
Chapter 16: Koi Shows: Your All-Access Pass to Koi Kichi-dom 251

Before you begin recruiting for committee members, the executive
committee needs to get a handle on the show parameters and the
overall structure of the event. The following sections highlight
these parameters as well as the planning and post-event stages.
For more about the show itself, the earlier section “Showing Off
Your Pride and Joy” gives a good rundown of the activities.
Show parameters
The executive committee has the responsibility for setting show
guidelines. Typical points of discussion that you’ll need to agree 
on are as follows:
 Registration: Will you limit registration to owners only?
 Size classes: Although koi have eight size classes, will you
group the sizes?
Consider limiting the classes to the four smaller sizes, omit-
ting the larger sizes. Your size classes may run like this:
• 16 to 17 inches (Group 4)
• Under 16 to 13 inches (Group 3)
• Under 13 to 10 inches (Group 2)
• Under 10 inches (Group 1)
 Varieties: Which varieties will be judged together?
 Awards: Will you use standard categories for trophies?
Standard categories include
• Best in Size for each group
• Grand Champion for Groups 3 and 4
• Reserve Champion for Groups 3 and 4
• Baby Champion for Groups 1 and 2
If long fin koi are permitted, we suggest a separate award 
for this category. (All koi are equal, but some are more equal
than others.)
Ribbons and certificates are standard for Best in Class 
and less formal categories.
 Local vendors: Will you ask these folks to donate raffle
prizes?
Supplies for the show, including test kits and AmQuel, 
should be purchased from local vendors to encourage 
their participation.

The planning stage
When you’re setting up a show, realize that you can’t find a perfect
date or a weekend without a competing event. Do the best you 
can and expect to hear, “Oh, the weekend before/after (deep sigh)
would have been so much better!” from a lot of people. It goes 
with the territory.
Ask your local vendors to help select a site and a hotel. They may
know the area better than you do, and they may be able to help
with negotiations. Most hotels have never been asked to host a koi
show, so you do have the element of uniqueness on your side. If
they have a large, grassy area to stage the show and a source of
water nearby, you can hold the show there. If the show is to be 
outdoors, be sure to check into local weather conditions, and plan
for canvas domes or tents if necessary.
When you make arrangements with hotel representatives, they’ll
want to know how many beds you need for how many nights, what
sort of meeting spaces you need, and how many meal functions
they can serve you.
Hotels love to sell you meals, and that’s how they make their
money. To keep costs down, use the hotel for the banquet only.
Promoting the event is critical. These are some ideas:
 Link up with as many online lists as you can find.
 Set up a Web site so people can register and pay fees online.
 Send postcards announcing the event to every koi club within
200 miles and ask them to tell all their members.
 Print a great-looking show poster and get members to put
them up everywhere — pond stores, laundromats, art supply
shops, bait shops — you get the idea.
 Put the poster online and ask koi enthusiasts within a 200-mile
radius to print it and take it to their local pond store.
 Call your local paper and ask for a feature article to appear
before the show.
Newspapers love to run articles after an event so they can’t
be accused of endorsing it. You need to ask them to run it
before the event. If they balk, maybe they’ll write the article
about your club and the popularity of koi and then just
happen to mention the show as sort of an afterthought.
Chapter 16: Koi Shows: Your All-Access Pass to Koi Kichi-dom 253

The post-event stage
Hold an evaluation after the show with people involved in the plan-
ning and with interested participants. Although you can have this
meeting the evening the show closes, everyone may be too tired 
to talk. But do plan to have it within a week, while the show is still
fresh in everyone’s minds. Provide snacks and drinks (the alcohol
level is up to you, but we suggest you limit it to nothing more
potent than wine).
You want to cover what worked and what didn’t and what should
be different next year. Don’t take anything personally — you want
what’s on people’s minds. Have someone take notes, or you’ll
never remember.
Plan a future club program around the show ID photos of the 
competing fish. Use the photos to illustrate the finer points of 
koi configuration.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
You’ve heard the songs — “50 Ways to Leave Your
Lover,” “One Is the Loneliest Number,” “Three Little
Words.” We wanted to put “Twenty Koi Tips” to music but
just couldn’t think of a catchy tune. Instead, we simply
offer you two lists of ten tips (not lyrical but still a thing 
of beauty!). Coming up in this part are easy-to-follow ways
to take action should you end up electricity-less or have a
sick koi on your hands.

Chapter 17
Ten Things to Do When 
the Power Goes Out
In This Chapter
 Minimize the numbers: That’s what friends are for
 Maintain water values: Cut the feedings and test the water
 Provide short-term solutions: Ammonia and nitrites down, oxygen up
 Solve the pump and filter problem: Alternative energy sources
A
s anyone with electricity in her home knows, the power is
bound to go out (when you least expect it, when you’re late
for work, and when you’re drying your hair). For a koi-keeper, a
power loss means more than frizz — this small inconvenience can
turn into a hairy ordeal if you have a koi pond and want to keep
your koi from going belly-side-up.
The great news is that you don’t have to feel like a duck in a shoot-
ing gallery when your power goes out — you can take certain
actions after the power goes off. To help save your koi (we figure
you can take care of yourself just fine), your first concerns are
 Providing oxygen to the fish
 Keeping water quality from deteriorating to a dangerous level
We hope you never need this info, but at least you’ll have some
course of action to follow when the lights go out. (You did remember
to keep fresh batteries in the flashlight so you can read this, right?)
Lower the Fish Load in Your Pond
If the power goes out, your koi can’t check into a hotel and use 
the Jacuzzi. They’re stuck in the pond and they’re going to be dis-
tressed pretty soon. What to do? Just like the wranglers out West,
you head ’em up and move ’em out.

In this case, you’re moving koi, not cattle, and they’re only going
into show tanks that have battery-powered pumps. Be sure that you
have enough tanks on hand to handle an emergency. See Chapter 3
for directions on calculating the ideal number of koi per tank so
you’ll know how many tanks to keep, and be sure to check Chapter 5
for advice on moving koi and adjusting them to new water.
If you don’t have show tanks, bag up some of your koi and take
them for temporary residency in the ponds of your koi friends 
who still have power. Trust us, these people will understand. Next
year, they may be the ones without power. Be sure to alert your
benefactors of any of your fish’s health concerns so they can take
appropriate quarantine measures.
Stop Feeding Your Fish
Your koi may gather at the pond edge and beg shamelessly, but it’s
all show. They can go for a week without food and not suffer. When
the power goes out, don’t feed your koi, even if that little Chagoi
hottie makes eye contact and goes “Wa-wa” with her mouth. The
last thing you need is your koi dumping ammonia and nitrites into
the water — which is exactly what they do when you feed them.
Do a 30-Percent Water Change
The easiest way to provide oxygen to your koi and dilute the
ammonia and nitrite levels at the same time is through 30 percent
partial water changes. We provide all the details you need to tackle
this process in Chapter 9.
Plan on doing these 30 percent changes daily until the power
comes back on. You do have lots of dechlor on hand, don’t you?
Test Your Water Daily for
Ammonia and Nitrites
As depressing as it may seem, you have to be extra vigilant about
your pond’s water chemistry when your power goes out. Use your
test kit daily and record the levels so you can see where they’re
headed. (To find out how to test your pond’s water quality, head
back to Chapter 9.) If the ammonia and nitrite levels get to the top
edge of the safe area, you need to take further steps to protect the
health of your koi. See Chapter 9 for this too.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
258

Add Salt or Zeolite
Ordinary kosher salt, that miracle tonic, can help reduce the nitrite
level in your pond. Just add 10 pounds per 1,000 gallons, but be
careful that no other medications are in the pond. If you’re combin-
ing salt with partial water changes, use a salt meter or a test kit to
keep the salt level around 1 percent.
If you forego salt, a mesh bag of the mineral zeolite can suck up
ammonia all on its own, and you can recharge it overnight by soak-
ing it in a garbage can filled with heavily salted water. Shake out
the bag the next morning and it’s good to go.
Obviously, you can use salt or zeolite in your pond, but never, ever
at the same time.
Use an Inverter to Power 
Your Air Pump
An inverter is a device that changes DC to AC, meaning it can con-
vert power from your car battery into power for one of the devices
you use in your pond. Just plug it into your car’s cigarette lighter.
The inverter may not be able to provide enough current for your
filter pump, but it can power an air pump (see Chapter 6) or a 6-volt
bilge pump. You don’t use the bilge pump to empty your pond; you
use it to aerate the water, directing the pump outflow through your
bog pond or across a 2 x 4 piece of plastic corrugate before the
water drips back into your pond.
Let ol’ Sol Power Your Pond
Solar power can actually be practical (meaning that it’s handy 
when you need it, not that it’s cheap). You can buy and install solar-
powered aerators. These are designed primarily for ponds in iso-
lated areas (but then again, when your power’s off, anyone can feel
plenty isolated). You have to provide a housing enclosure for the
compressor and batteries and a pole for mounting the solar unit,
but who cares? These same solar units can power water pumps.
Solar-powered aerators are made by several manufacturers —
most are made for lakes, which is more than what you need. Use
your browser to search for a manufacturer of solar aerators for fish
Chapter 17: Ten Things to Do When the Power Goes Out 259

ponds, or ask your local utility company for leads on solar panels
for pond aeration. Here’s one vendor for a pond-sized solar aera-
tion unit (about $400 for one large enough to handle 100 square
feet of pond surface; one unit would work for our basic 6-x-9-foot
pond): Pennington Equipment Company, 1520 NW 6th St.,
Springfield, IL 62702; phone 888-261-4726, fax 886-422-0018; Web
site www.solaraerator.com.
Mist Your Pond
Add a mist nozzle to your garden hose and place the end over the
edge of your pond. Brace the hose in place with a couple of bricks
and turn the water on. The water absorbs oxygen from the air as it
sprays into your pond. This can be done continuously, along with
the other measures mentioned. If you dechlor for your daily 30 per-
cent water changes, you don’t need to worry about dechlorinating
the water added by the misting.
Use Compressed Air
You can also rent tanks of compressed air to bubble air into your
pond. Your local pond store can usually recommend a local source,
or search online. (Sorry, you can’t get tanks of oxygen except with a
physician’s prescription, and those small tanks only last four hours.
Besides, you may need the oxygen yourself when you figure out
what it’s going to cost to replace all the food in that doublewide
freezer you just bought!)
Use a Portable Battery System 
to Power Your Filter
You can actually buy an emergency back-up power system for your
pond. One model is a 1,500-watt system with an inverter to power
two AC outlets. This same unit can power air pumps and air-
powered filters. You recharge the unit with your car battery or
with a solar charging unit (you provide the car battery; the vendor
can supply the solar unit). Use your phone book to find a local
vendor to save on shipping costs, but if you can’t find one locally,
try an Internet search. One we found was Superpond, 422 E.

Chapter 18
Ten Things to Check If 
Your Koi Seem Sick
In This Chapter
 External forces: It’s all in the water (values and temps)
 Physical symptoms: From chin to fin
 Finny behaviors: Swimming and socializing
K
oi don’t just turn over and die. They show signs — some overt,
some not — that something’s funky. Keep a close eye on your
pond and watch for any of the signs we talk about in this chapter;
then take action before you finny friends get really sick. (Try not to
be paranoid, though, or you’ll defeat the purpose for keeping koi —
to sit back, relax, and enjoy them.) Chapter 13 has all the important
details on diagnosing and treating a sick fish, but this chapter guides
you through the checkpoints for reaching a diagnosis.
The Pond’s Water Quality
You’ll hear this advice so much that you’ll begin muttering it in
your sleep: The health of your koi is directly related to the quality
of their pond water. When water chemistry values get out of whack,
especially the ammonia and nitrite levels, they compromise your
koi’s immune systems. Practically any nearby bacteria or virus 
can move in and set up housekeeping. Then you and your koi have
compounded problems. Head back to Chapter 9 to find out how to
check and fix the water quality if a chemical’s out of balance.
The Pond’s Water Temperature
Is the pond’s water temperature between 75 and 85 degrees F? It
should be. Koi are remarkably adaptive fish, but they have a limit 

to what they can deal with successfully. If the water’s too cold, 
their immune systems can’t fight off infection, particularly the
opportunistic cool-water bacteria, Aeromonas and Pseudomonas
(see Chapter 13). When water temps near the mid-80s and the
normal afternoon pH rise elevates the ammonia level, your koi 
are subjected to the flesh-curdling effects (fin rot and gill plate
swelling) of ammonia. Think of Goldilocks’s porridge when it 
comes to pond temps — not too hot and not too cool. For the how-
to on correcting the pond’s water temperature, consult Chapter 9.
Your Koi’s Scales
Do any of the scales stick out from the body? Those that stand out
are called pine cone scales, and they indicate a severe internal
infection, the kind that makes the body swell up. This isn’t a good
sign at all, and it calls for all of the following steps:
 Immediate transfer to a spacious quarantine tub (spacious
because your koi’s going to be there for a while)
 Antibiotic feed or injections
 Careful monitoring
Don’t be surprised if this symptom also calls for a one-way trip to
the garbage can. After a koi undergoes this sort of internal pressure,
recovery is a surprise.
Your Koi’s Gills
Does the fish seem to have trouble breathing? Gill plates swell 
and can’t accept enough oxygen when the water’s ammonia levels
are too high. Your poor koi not only feels awful, he’s also oxygen-
deprived. Make an immediate 30 percent partial water change and
track down the cause of the ammonia problem. Check the color of
the gills — are they the color of your own gums? (Good.) Are they
pale pink? (Not good.) Do they look spongy, like moist bread? (Oh,
not good.) Gill plates that develop white patches and appear to be
disintegrating may indicate koi herpes virus. This virus is highly
contagious and is usually fatal. See Chapter 13 for more details.
Your Koi’s Finny-Fin-Fins
Human eyes may be the window to the soul, but the window to
your koi’s health is through the thin skin covering their fins:
Part V: The Part of Tens 
262

 Tattered fins mean the koi has fin rot or has been handled and
netted too much.
 Bleeding fins indicate rough handling, poor water quality, or a
pond bottom that’s too rough.
 Swollen spots on the leading edge of a fin may indicate carp
pox. (You can’t do anything about this virus except increase
the water temperature enough to activate the koi’s own
immune system. Increase water temps only a few degrees a
day to enable the koi to adjust.)
Check out Chapter 13 for additional fin remedies.
Your Koi’s Underside
As part of a general checkup, bowl your koi and lift it to check its
underside, or bag it and examine its underside through the bag.
Aeromonas, the cause of hole-in-side disease (see Chapter 13), tends
to erupt as an ulcer on the underside of koi, particularly between
the pectoral fins. However, the ulcers can show up nearly anywhere.
Aeromonas can also bloat the body and cause pine cone disease.
You can usually avoid the problem by keeping the pond temp
above 68 degrees. Treatment consists of bringing the koi inside 
for a month or two of careful water temperature regulation and
antibiotic treatment. Alternatively, you can treat the entire pond
with salt, potassium permanganate, or a commercially available
antibacterial, or you can admit you don’t know what’s happenin’,
baby, and call in a koi vet or a more experienced koi-keeper.
Your Koi’s Body
Does the koi’s body have tiny white spots? This may be Ich (a para-
sitic disease) or a fungus. Take a scraping and examine it under the
microscope to make a diagnosis. (Chapter 13 walks you through
this process.)
Pet stores carry several off-the-shelf medications for Ich, or you
can use malachite green, salt, or temperature manipulation, as we
describe in Chapter 13.
The diagnosis of fungus calls for a different approach because fungus
is a secondary infection, one that appears after your koi’s protective
mucous coating has been damaged. Identify and eliminate the prob-
lem (from netting, poor water quality, or inadequate diet) and then
treat for the fungus (see Chapter 13 for treatment plans).
Chapter 18: Ten Things to Check If Your Koi Seem Sick 263

Your Koi’s Belly-Side Behavior
(Are You Being Flashed?)
Do your koi seem to be rubbing their bodies against the sides or
bottom of the pond, or are they turning over at the surface of the
water? This maneuver is called flashing, and it usually indicates a
parasitic infestation or an electrical short in the pond.
External parasites on your fish are about as comfortable as head-
to-toe poison ivy on you. Do a skin scrape to ID, and then treat for
the little varmints.
In case of a possible electrical problem (damaged electrical cord,
cracked housing, or the suspicious scent of bad circuitry), unplug,
remove, and examine any submerged pumps or filters for a possi-
ble short circuit.
Your Koi’s Swimming Style
Do your koi swim strong and in a straight line? Koi that have diffi-
culty remaining upright while swimming may
 Have metabolic bone disease
 Have been shocked by an electrical current
 Be in the close-to-terminal stages of disease
 Have been exposed to toxic substances such as fertilizer 
or insecticides
These are all bad news. No matter what the exact cause, you need
to identify it and deal with it (but turn off the power to your pond
before you try to pull up that submerged pump, please!). Chapter
13 can help you with these problems.
Your Koi’s Social Savvy
Does a formerly friendly koi seem to avoid contact with other koi
and with (gasp!) you? Sick koi often stay away from other koi and
may be uninterested in food. A koi that suddenly elects to avoid
other koi is the proverbial canary in a coal mine, at least in terms
of his health. Keep an eye on him for a couple of days. If he doesn’t
elect to rejoin the herd, you may want to bowl him to look him
over. (Let Chapter 13 be your guide for your observations.)

Koi have some very distinct
differences from goldfish.In
addition to unique body
shapes and features,koi
flaunt a wide range of colors
and patterns — red,white,
and black are among the
most popular.See Chapter 2.

Koi come in a variety of
colors and patterns,some
highly coveted.See
Chapter 2.

Display (or garden-variety)
koi are inexpensive and
are popular for outdoor
ponds,especially for the
beginning koi keeper.We
can’t promise that they’ll
learn to kiss,but they’re
cute just the same.See
Chapters 2 and 4.

A few of the koi varieties
include Asagi (red and
white with a blue back),
mirror-scaled Matsuba
(yellow with gray shad-
ing),and Sanke (white
with red and black mark-
ings).See Chapter 2.

A pond placed near your patio makes it easy to watch your koi.
Just be sure to watch where you’re walking! See Chapter 6.

A weathered statue and fountain amid a lush garden landscape create 
a serene setting that’s a feast for both the eyes and ears.See Chapter 8.

Koi can become absurdly tame and will beg for food.Japan is well-known for its wealth of koi,
elaborate ponds and gardens for the koi kichi (koi crazy),and public koi ponds.See Chapter 4.

Koi bred with long fins are
called butterfly koi.This
Platinum Gin Matsuba is a
well-sought-after variety.
See Chapter 2.

Young koi are raised in large indoor
pools,often at fish farms.See
Chapter 4.

Koi often chase and interact with each
other and do ying-yang stunts.(Okay,
maybe that last part was just a coinci-
dence.) See Chapter 2.

© ARCO IMAGES / ALAMY
As koi grow,their colors tend to intensify.Take advantage of the beautiful 
hues with an outdoor pond that you can overlook from a patio.See Chapter 6.

An elaborately planted garden accents these Kohako (red and white),Asagi (red and white with a blue back),and Bekko (white with black
markings) koi.The privacy and intimacy of this garden are also desirable for the soul-searcher and are common in Japanese settings.
