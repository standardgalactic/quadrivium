Ihad the wonderful opportunity of celebrating with all the people you will see in 
my photographs. Some of their communities are nestled in remote corners of the 
world, and their cultures are among the oldest still in existence. 
I lived with these families, sharing their homes, food, and daily lives. I joined 
in their special festivities and ceremonies. The celebrations were big and small, 
lasting several days or just a few minutes. They marked changes in people’s lives, 
expressed thankfulness, and honored important people and events. 
On the surface these celebrations may appear to be different from one 
another, but observing them firsthand I realized all of these societies were really 
doing the same things to celebrate; they were just doing them in their own ways. 
I also discovered that these ceremonies and festivities based in ancient cultures 
have a lot in common with our modern celebrations. 
Experiencing these connections 
among celebrations showed me it 
doesn’t matter which language we sing 
in or what color our skin is underneath 
our costumes or clothing. We are much
more alike than we are different.         
So let’s celebrate together, as one       
human family!

wedding, a Sherpa zendi celebration, 
in the Everest region of the Himalaya.

Tibetans and Sherpas of the 
Everest region of the Himalaya 
gather in the Thami Valley for 
Mani Rimdu. For three days 
during the celebration, people 
receive blessings for good 
health and good fortune from 
spiritual leaders called lamas. 
WHEN WE CELEBRATE . . .
WHEN WE CELEBRATE . . .

In the spring, Sami gather 
to celebrate the return of 
sunlight to the Arctic region 
of Northern Europe. The
 days are much warmer and 
 longer, and people meet
   up with family and 
   friends they have  
   not seen all   
  winter. 
Hundreds of Tuareg come 
together in the center of the 
Sahara desert to celebrate 
Dar Moulay. They gather 
every spring for this three-
day celebration, starting on 
the eve of a full moon. The 
festivities honor the life of 
Moulay, an ancestral hero 
known as a great leader 
and healer of the sick. 
   WE GATHER TOGETHER
www.ebook3000.com

A Yanomami community in 
the Amazon gathers because 
someone in the village has 
died. Close relatives and 
friends parade around the 
village to say good-bye and 
wish the person well in the 
spirit world. Together they 
celebrate the life they shared 
with their friend and loved one.
Inside an igloo, Inuit in the 
Arctic come together to sing 
Kayavak. One person makes  
a unique throaty sound into a 
large pot, which amplifies the 
sound. A second person in turn 
tries to imitate the sound of the 
first. This goes back and forth 
faster and faster, until one of 
the singers makes a mistake 
and they break into laughter.

Americans get together on 
the fourth of July to celebrate 
Independence Day and the 
birth of the United States as a 
nation in 1776. The fourth of 
July is traditionally marked by 
parades with local citizens, 
fire trucks, and floats; picnics 
and barbecues; and nighttime 
displays of colorful fireworks.
On the South Asian island     
of Bali, one hundred men 
traditionally gather for the 
chorus of an ancient dance 
ritual called Sanghyang.       
The men chant softly, over 
and over, their voices uniting   
in a rhythmic melody to 
accompany dancers. This 
ancient celebration con­nects  
the Balinese with their ancestors.  
www.ebook3000.com

These Tuareg men drink   
tea to celebrate the upcoming 
marriage of a relative. As 
they share their drink, anyone 
who objects to the marriage 
has a chance to speak. The 
tea is made with strong mint 
and lots of sugar, which 
coats and soothes parched, 
dry throats. 
WHEN WE CELEBRATE . . .

The Balinese bake elaborate 
cakes for celebrations. This 
cake is for a wedding and 
represents the entire universe. 
The pictures at the bottom 
show the lower world where 
evil lives. The man and woman 
in the middle represent life on 
Earth. Everything above the 
couple represents goodness in 
the heavens. 
This Inuit family eats slices of frozen 
raw fish to give thanks for their good 
catch. The Inuit fish through holes cut 
in the thick ice covering lakes. Some 
still use traditional fishing methods: 
lines of sinew wound on sticks, hand-
carved hooks made of animal bones, 
and caribou flesh for bait. 
WE EAT AND DRINK
www.ebook3000.com

A Yanomami man carries two 
armadillos that have been roasted 
over an open fire. Armadillo is a 
special food for the Yanomami 
and is only served on important 
occasions. Today the armadillo 
will be eaten to honor a member 
of the community who died. 
An Aboriginal boy catches a 
carpet snake curled inside a 
hollow log. The snake will be 
roasted and eaten to celebrate 
walking on a Dream Journey. 
When walking on a Dream 
Journey, Aborigines travel 
ancient pathways they believe 
were originally traveled by their 
ancestors. This reconnects them 
with their land and spiritual past.

A family in the United States 
gathers for a turkey dinner to 
celebrate Thanksgiving. The 
tradition commemorates a time 
in North American history when 
Native Americans helped early 
settlers learn to live off of the 
land. At harvesttime, they all 
shared a feast of wild game 
and crops they had grown. 
Today Americans gather with 
friends and family to give 
thanks for the good things in 
their lives.  
Sami reindeer herders 
celebrate the return of spring 
with a big batch of reindeer 
stew. During winter in the     
far north, it is dark most of the 
day and night, and the Sami 
depend almost entirely on 
reindeer for food. When the sun 
returns in spring, the Sami add 
berries and fish to their meals. 
The reindeer stew symbolizes 
the end of their winter diet. 
www.ebook3000.com

These Yanomami women 
decorate their faces for a 
celebration using paste made 
from onoto seeds. To make   
the paste, the women pull 
sticky red onoto seeds from 
pods and crush the seeds with 
their fingers. Black paste is 
created by mixing ashes into 
the crushed red seeds. The 
sticks in the women’s faces 
are worn daily.   
WHEN WE CELEBRATE . . .
WHEN WE CELEBRATE . . .

A young Tuareg boy dips a 
wet stick into a pouch filled 
with ashes. Using the stick, he 
decorates his eyes, darkening 
his eyelids and eyebrows. Like 
other Tuareg males, when he 
wears his indigo-colored veil for 
Dar Moulay, only his decorated 
eyes show. 
 
For special occasions, Aborigines 
decorate themselves with paint 
made from natural materials that 
they gather, such as rocks and 
roots. These materials are baked, 
pounded into powder, and mixed 
with water to make paint in shades 
of red, brown, and yellow. 
WE DECORATE OURSELVES
www.ebook3000.com

This Sami girl wears 
traditional clothes for the 
spring festival celebration. 
Her curved-toe shoes are 
made from reindeer hide 
and sewn with thread made 
of reindeer sinew. The 
festival includes reindeer 
roping contests, sleigh
 rides, and reindeer races. 
An Inuit boy is dressed up as 
a wolf, wearing a real wolf 
skin. His family is celebrating 
a good hunt. The boy’s 
father hunted the wolf after it 
attacked the family’s
caribou herd. The
boy’s mother 
prepared the wolf 
skin to preserve 
it and may 
later trade it 
at the fur 
market. 

This woman in Tibet is 
decorated with special 
beads for a zendi, a 
wedding celebration. The 
beads are made from 
turquoise (greenish beads), 
coral (red beads), and 
amber (the yellow bead). 
One of the rarest and most 
highly-valued beads is the  
black-and-white dzi bead, 
such as the ones in this 
woman’s hair. 
Children in the United 
States wear costumes for 
Halloween. The celebration 
of Halloween evolved from 
Celtic traditions marking the 
transition from summer to 
the darker days of winter. 
During this time of year it 
was thought spirits could 
communicate with the living. 
People wore costumes to 
ward off any evil spirits. 
www.ebook3000.com

The Inuit perform Kaylauzak, a 
meditative drumming and dancing, 
to celebrate a successful caribou 
hunt. The Inuit honor the caribou    
by using all parts of the animal. 
Bones are used for tools; sinew for 
lashing and thread; meat for food; 
and skins for clothing, bedding, and 
musical instruments. 
WHEN WE CELEBRATE . . .

This Aboriginal man plays
the didgeridoo, an instrument 
made from a eucalyptus 
tree branch that has been 
hollowed out by termites. 
Part of many Aborigine 
celebrations, didgeridoos 
are very difficult to play. 
The musicians make 
continual music using
circular breathing— 
breathing in through the
nose while blowing out
 through the mouth.
When a Sami shaman beats 
his reindeer hide drum, he 
is celebrating his connection 
with the natural world. It is 
believed the shaman has special 
abilities  to communicate with 
the spirits of nature. Because 
of this, people in his community 
ask him questions such as “How 
long will the winter continue?” 
and “When will the good   
rains come?” 
 WE PLAY MUSIC
www.ebook3000.com

At the celebration of Dar 
Moulay, Tuareg men beat 
their drums in a complicated 
musical rhythm. Several 
different beats may be heard 
at the same time. Women 
Tibetan musicians blow 
large, ancient seashells to 
call for blessings of good 
fortune throughout the year. 
The deep sounds from the 
shells can be heard for 
miles, bringing comfort to 
all who hear them. These 
shells are still found in the 
high Himalaya, indicating 
that long ago this area was 
under the sea. 
join in by ululating—
making loud, high-pitched 
sounds in their throats 
while rapidly moving their 
tongues from the front to 
the back of their mouths. 

Balinese children and adults 
play in a gamelan, or orchestra, 
creating music to accompany a 
traditional story presented as a 
play. The orchestra is composed 
largely of percussion instruments 
such as xylophones, drums, and 
gongs, though other instruments, 
such as flutes, may be included.
These children are playing 
music as part of a Memorial 
Day celebration in the United 
States. On Memorial Day, 
Americans remember those who 
died while serving their country  
in the military. Many towns and 
cities hold parades with marching 
bands and concerts playing 
traditional American music.
www.ebook3000.com

The Legong dance, performed by 
these women, celebrates a traditional 
story that is an important part of 
Balinese history. The story illustrates 
the value of love and truth, as a 
prince fights to win back his princess. 
Accompanied by the quick tempo of 
the gamelan, many of the dancers’ 
movements are precise motions of   
the eyes and fingers.  
WHEN WE CELEBRATE . . .
WHEN WE CELEBRATE . . .

In the ceremonies of Mani Rimdu, 
dances tell old stories about how to 
live a loving, compassionate life. 
Traditionally only monks read the 
ancient texts, so they danced 
and acted out the stories for the 
community. Many dances 
are humorous, allowing 
the audience to laugh 
while learning a 
lesson from the 
story. 
Yanomami dance as they sing 
heris, songs of thanks for good 
fortune, such as a bountiful 
hunt. Heris are sung at dusk 
every evening when Yanomami 
of all ages gather together in 
open areas within their large 
shaponos—thatched grass huts 
that house up to one hundred 
extended family members.
WE DANCE
www.ebook3000.com

When they are born, Aboriginal 
children are given animal names 
along with their family names. 
The animal names are called their 
dreaming. The Aborigines believe 
that when they dance their 
dreaming—pounding the earth 
with their feet—they reconnect 
with the time of creation and the 
creators of all life. 
Dancing is a common part of many 
Tuareg celebrations. The rhythm of 
a drum compels men to move to the 
beat and join in the dancing during 
this casual gathering. The dance is 
individual, and all are welcome to 
stand and express themselves. 

Every summer in the United 
States, the Bread & Puppet 
Theater of Vermont uses dances 
and puppets to act out stories 
celebrating life. During the 
festivities, the theater group 
also serves bread to everyone 
gathered. The sharing of bread 
symbolizes the connections of 
community, while the dances 
celebrate human creativity and 
self-expression.

This Sami family lights a fire 
inside their lavu, a structure 
traditionally made of tree 
saplings covered with 
reindeer skin. Spring is here 
and it is time for the reindeer 
roundup, when calves are 
lassoed and brought in for 
marking. Through the night,  
as reindeer are tallied, stories 
are told around the fire.

WE USE  	
	
   
A mandala, an ornate painting 
often made from naturally dyed 
river sand, is being burned in a 
Tibetan celebration. Burning the 
mandala symbolizes the idea 
that human beings should let go 
of material objects not essential 
to life. After the mandala is 
burned, the sand is returned to 
the river, which represents the 
flow of life.
An Aborignal man creates a
smoky fire at a celebration to send 
off the spirit of a relative who has 
recently died. He believes his 
thoughts will rise with the smoke 
and urge his relative to leave Earth 
and life in human form. This is the 
time for the relative’s spirit to travel 
to the spirit world. 
FIRE
www.ebook3000.com

Balinese men chant at a 
celebration in which a young 
man rides a “horse” made
 from dried grass over burning 
coconut shells. The young 
man’s feet land on the hot
coals as he moves back and 
forth. By fire walking the 
young man demonstrates that 
he has achieved a deep, 
trancelike level of relaxation
and inner calm. 

Fire is an essential part of Tuareg 
celebrations. At this wedding,men
 and women build separate fires. 
The fires are used for cooking
bread and pots of camel meat, 
and are also a gathering place for 
passing on knowledge from man 
to man and woman to woman. 
When Americans celebrate 
their birthdays each year, they 
put lighted candles on their 
birthday cakes. It is believed 
that this practice started with 
the ancient Greeks. Traditionally, 
the birthday celebrant makes   
a wish and tries to blow out all 
the candles at once. If he or she 
succeeds, the wish will come true.

Although cultural celebrations around 
the world may not look the same, they 
actually have a lot in common. We all 
celebrate things for which we are 
thankful, changes in our lives, and 
important people and events. We all 
eat and drink, decorate ourselves, sing 
and dance, and use fire. We all gather 
together with family, friends, and 
neighbors to share these special times 
in our lives. 
We are one human family celebrating 
life on Earth!
THERE ARE MANY 
WAYS TO CELEBRATE    
THE HUMAN SPIRIT
