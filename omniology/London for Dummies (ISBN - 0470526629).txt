Introduction
F
or all its historic panache, time-honored traditions, quaint corners, 
and associations with royal pomp and ceremony, London is very 
much a modern European city. London is a rich blend of the very old 
and the very new, with attractions ranging from the Tower of London, 
begun in 1066, to the Tate Modern gallery, which opened in 2000. It’s big, 
too, both in size and population; more than 9 million people reside in 
the 1,611-sq.-km (622-sq.-mile) megalopolis known as Greater London.
For first-time visitors, London can be a bit of a challenge. But with some 
advance planning and useful information under your belt, making the 
trip will be easier and even more enjoyable than you thought. London 
may be far from where you live, but for many people, a trip to England is 
like going home.
About This Book
London For Dummies, 6th Edition, is meant to be used as a reference. 
You can start at the first page and read all the way through; if you do, 
you’ll end up with an unusually complete knowledge of London essen-
tials. On the other hand, you may not need parts of this book because 
you’ve already been to London or know the basics of international 
travel. You’re after quick, easy-to-find specifics. In that case, you can 
easily flip to the part that you need or home in on a specific chapter. 
The philosophy behind this book is quite simple: I wanted to create 
the kind of guide that I wished I’d had on my first trips to London — 
informative, practical, down-to-earth, and fun.
When you travel, unexpected surprises create the most memorable 
moments and provide the stories that you take back with you. But the 
other side of travel is details and planning. Questions about where to eat 
and sleep aren’t small issues when you’re away from home. They can 
make or break a trip — I know that. So what I offer here is based on my 
own experience in traveling, living, and working in London.
You should know, however, that travel information is subject to change 
at any time — especially prices. Therefore, I suggest that you write or

Conventions Used in This Book
I recently tried to extract some information from a guidebook and found 
so many symbols that I needed training in hieroglyphics to interpret 
them all. I’m happy to report that the user-friendly London For Dummies, 
6th Edition, travel guide isn’t like that. I keep the use of symbols and 
abbreviations to a minimum. Here are the conventions you need to be 
aware of while using this book:
 
✓ The credit card abbreviations are AE (American Express), DC 
(Diners Club), MC (MasterCard), and V (Visa).
 
✓ I include the London postal area (SW7, for example) in all street 
addresses, in case you want to look up the street in a London A–Z 
or other London street reference map.
 
✓ I give the nearest Tube (subway) stop for all destinations (for 
example, Tube: Piccadilly Circus).
 
✓ I list all prices first in British pounds sterling (£), and then in U.S. 
dollars ($). When prices are $10 or over, I round them to the near-
est dollar; when prices are under $10, I round them to the nearest 
nickel). Although the exchange rate fluctuates daily, in this book, I 
use the rate £1 = $1.65.
 
✓ The London city code, 020, precedes all London telephone num-
bers in this book; a different toll-free or charge-for-call code applies 
in a few cases, which I note. The local London number follows the 
city code. If you’re calling London from outside the United Kingdom, 
you must dial the U.K. country code (44), followed by 20 and the 
local number. If you’re calling London from elsewhere within the 
United Kingdom, dial 020 before the number. If you’re calling 
London from within London, just dial the local number.
I also apply a few conventions to the listings of hotels, restaurants, and 
attractions, as follows:
 
✓ I list the hotels, restaurants, and top attractions in alphabetical 
order, so you can easily move among the maps and descriptions.
 
✓ For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that you can find on a 
map in this book, I include a page reference in the listing informa-
tion. If a hotel, restaurant, or attraction is outside the city limits or 
in an out-of-the-way area, it may not be mapped.
 
✓ I give exact prices for every hotel, restaurant, and attraction. Please 
note, however, that prices are subject to change. Also, an addi-
tional 17.5 percent value-added tax (VAT) is added to restaurant 
meals and may be added to hotel bills. (I note in the individual 
hotel listings if the price does not include VAT.)

 Introduction 3
 
✓ I use a system of dollar signs ($) to show a range of costs for 
hotels or restaurants. The dollar signs for hotels correspond 
to rack rates (non-discounted standard rates) and reflect a 
hotel’s low to high rates for a double room. For restaurants, the 
dollar signs denote the average cost of dinner for one person, 
including appetizer, main course, dessert, a nonalcoholic drink, 
tax, and a tip. Check out the following table to decipher the dollar 
signs:
Cost 
Hotel 
Restaurant
$ 
£100 ($165) and under 
£15 ($25) and under
$$ 
£101–£150 ($167–$248) 
£16–£30 ($26–$50)
$$$ 
£151–£200 ($249–$330) 
£31–£45 ($51–$74)
$$$$ 
£201–£250 ($332–$413) 
£46 ($76) and up
$$$$$ 
£251 ($414) and up
 
✓ I divide the hotels into two categories — my personal favorites and 
those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still get my hearty 
seal of approval. Don’t be shy about considering these “runner-up” 
hotels, if you can’t get a room at one of my favorites or if your pref-
erences differ from mine — the amenities that the runners-up offer 
and the services that each provides make all these accommoda-
tions good choices to consider as you determine where to rest 
your head at night.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your 
needs may be as a traveler:
 
✓ You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance 
when determining whether to take a trip to London and how to 
plan for it.
 
✓ You may be an experienced traveler, but you don’t have a lot of 
time to devote to trip planning or you don’t have a lot of time to 
spend in London after you get there — you want expert advice on 
how to maximize your time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
 
✓ You may be looking for a carefully selective guidebook, one that 
focuses only on the places that will give you the best or most 
unique experiences in London.
If you fit any of these criteria, then London For Dummies, 6th Edition, has 
all the information you’re looking for!

How This Book Is Organized
This book has six parts, plus an appendix. You can read all the parts 
independently — so if you want to zero in on restaurants or hotels, you 
can turn right to that part. Or you can read the book sequentially to find 
out all that you need to know about planning and visiting the City by the 
Thames. In the following sections, I outline what each part covers.
Part I: Introducing London
This part introduces London and gives you some excellent reasons for 
going there. I give you a rundown of the best that London has to offer, 
from hotels to historic sights, and then take you deeper into the city’s 
culture, providing information to help you appreciate London’s history, 
architecture, and cuisine. You can use this part to help you decide on the 
best time of year for your visit. I also recommend some books and movies 
that may whet your appetite and enhance your enjoyment of London.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London
This part helps take some of the wrinkles out of trip planning. First, you 
can get some tips on managing your money and planning a realistic 
budget. You can also find information on getting to London by air or by 
crossing over (or under) the English Channel from Europe. Included 
here are all the options for airlines, tips on how to get the best fare, plus 
the lowdown on package tours and whether they can really save you 
money. I provide special tips for families, travelers with disabilities, 
seniors, and gays and lesbians. This part also covers the details that you 
need to take care of or consider before your trip begins — from pass-
ports to health insurance.
Part III: Settling into London
This part tells you what you need to know after you arrive. A bit of orien-
tation is in order, including detailed information on the ways, means, 
and costs of getting from the airport into the city. The thumbnail 
sketches of London neighborhoods can help you decide where you want 
to stay and what areas you may want to explore. You can find everything 
that you need to know about getting around town — whether you travel 
on foot, by public transit, or in a taxi. I explain what kind of accommoda-
tions you can expect for your money and describe London’s best hotels 
and B&Bs. After that, I talk about the city’s dining scene, provide you 
with an appetizing survey of London’s best restaurants, and provide a 
list of places for quick, casual meals; simple or glamorous teas; down-to-
earth fish-and-chips joints; and picnic possibilities.
Part IV: Exploring London
This part is dedicated to seeing the sights — from the absolute must-
sees to lesser-known haunts and fascinating places that are only a quick 
train or Tube ride away. You can find all kinds of guided tours and 

 Introduction 5
shopping coverage that steers you to a whole range of big stores (yes, 
including Harrods) and small specialty shops. I also provide four sample 
itineraries that maximize your sightseeing but won’t leave you gasping 
for breath. And if you want to explore beyond London, check out my six 
great day trips — to Bath, Stonehenge, and more.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife
This part introduces you to the performing arts, with an emphasis on 
London’s fabulous theater scene, and all manner of after-dark entertain-
ment possibilities. I clue you in to the best sources for finding out what’s 
going on around town and tell you how to get tickets. I also steer you 
toward some of the city’s best pubs, clubs, bars, and discos.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part allows me to squeeze in some extra people, places, and things 
that you may want to know about but that don’t really fit in elsewhere in 
the book. My lists include ten special London churches, ten historic 
pubs, and ten important royals — past and present.
Quick Concierge
This appendix includes an A-to-Z directory of fast facts that you need to 
know, such as how the telephone system works, what numbers to call in 
an emergency, and what taxes you must pay. I also provide a list of toll-
free telephone numbers and Web sites for airlines and hotel chains serv-
ing London, and tell you where to go to find more information on London.
Icons Used in This Book
These six icons appear in the margins throughout this book:
 
 Bargain Alert is my favorite icon — and I suspect it may be yours, too. I’m 
not cheap, but I love to save money and find out about special deals. Every 
time I tell you about something that can save you money, I mark it with 
the Bargain Alert icon.
 
 The Best of the Best icon highlights the best London has to offer in all 
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, shopping, and nightlife.
 
 I’m not an alarmist, so you won’t find too many Heads Up icons in this 
book. If you see one, it means that I want you to be aware of something, 
such as ticket agencies claiming to sell “reduced-price tickets” or the double-
tipping scam that you may encounter in a restaurant. London, you’ll be 
pleased to know, isn’t the kind of city that requires too many warning labels.
 Traveling with children? Keep your eyes peeled for the Kid Friendly icon. 
If a hotel is marked by this icon, it welcomes families with children and 
may even provide extras for kids. If a restaurant is marked by this icon, 
the kids will enjoy the food or the atmosphere, and the staff will be 

London For Dummies, 6th Edition 
6
welcoming to youngsters. And if you see an attraction marked by this 
icon, kids will (probably) enjoy something about the place.
 
 When was the last time you read a travel book that filled you in on local 
gossip, as well as all the mundane facts? For the London Tattler icon 
(named after the famous London newspaper, The Tatler, published from 
1709–11), I include only the most newsworthy scandals — I mean stories — 
to report on. I throw in these tidbits about well-known Londoners and 
curious bits of London lore just for the fun of it. There’s even a bit in 
Chapter 1 about my own memorable meeting with Prince Philip in 
Buckingham Palace.
 
 The Tip icon highlights useful bits of information that can save you time 
or enhance your London experience. A Tip alerts you to something (like a 
special guided tour or a way to avoid standing in long lines) that you may 
not otherwise consider or even know about.
Where to Go from Here
To London, of course! This book gives you the tools you need to make 
the most of your trip, making it a very good place to start your journey. 
Because the book covers all the basics, it’s an excellent guide to help 
you plan, anticipate, and understand exactly what you want to see and 
do in London. Whatever your plan, I hope that you think of me as your 
guide or companion on the journey. I love London! My goal is to help 
you have a great time while you’re there.

Part I
Introducing London

In this part . . . 
A
re you a stranger to London? Well, now’s the time to be 
properly introduced. This part helps you put a face to 
the place. In Chapter 1, I give a general overview of the best 
this great city has to offer, sketching in some details so you 
know what you can find there — including the newest attrac-
tions. Chapter 2 helps you understand London from a histori-
cal, architectural, and gastronomical perspective and gives 
you a few suggestions for books and movies that may add to 
your London knowledge. If you haven’t decided when to go, 
turn to Chapter 3, where I fill you in on what London offers 
during each season and why you may find some times better 
than others for a visit.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of London
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering London’s greatest historic landmarks
▶ Exploring London’s world-famous museums
▶ Tasting the best of British cuisine
▶ Enjoying London’s performing arts and nightlife
▶ Experiencing the urban charms of London
S
o, you’re going to London. Gives you a thrill just thinking about it, 
right? The capital of the United Kingdom is one of the world’s top 
destinations, visited year-round by millions from all corners of the globe. 
In fact, international travel surveys consistently rank London as one of the 
most popular holiday destinations in the world. After you arrive, you 
make your way through one of the most historic, cultured, and exciting 
cities on Earth. You have every reason to feel a tingle of anticipation.
This chapter gives you an at-a-glance reference to the absolute best — 
the best of the best — that London has to offer. In the categories that I 
outline, you find some of the things that make visiting London so much 
fun and so endlessly fascinating.
 
 I discuss each of these places in detail later in this book; you can find them 
in their indicated chapters, marked with a Best of the Best icon.
The Best Places to Soak Up London’s History
The great historic landmarks in London never fail to stir the imagination: 
They’ve been witness to so much — from glorious triumphs to bloody 
tragedies — that it’s almost impossible to remain unmoved when visit-
ing them. In Chapter 11, you find more details on London’s top attrac-
tions. Here are my picks for the best of the best:
 
✓ An almost perceptible aura of legend pervades the Tower of London, 
which was built over 900 years ago. When visiting the Tower, you 
tread the ground where the great dramas and terrors of a turbulent 

Part I: Introducing London 
10
kingdom were played out, where Elizabeth I was held captive while 
still a princess, and where Sir Thomas More and Anne Boleyn 
(second wife of Henry VIII and mother of the future Elizabeth I) 
were beheaded.
 
✓ No less venerable is Westminster Abbey, a magnificent Gothic 
church that ranks as the most historically significant religious 
structure in England. Stepping into Westminster Abbey, you enter 
the place where England’s kings and queens have been crowned 
since William the Conqueror claimed the throne in 1066, and where 
some of England’s greatest figures are buried or memorialized.
 
✓ Many of London’s most historic sites are or were royal domains, 
and royal watching is a sport almost as popular as horse racing. 
Okay, so you’re probably not going to get invited to the queen’s 
garden party, but you can see where those famous parties take 
place — and stroll through the royal staterooms — by visiting 
Buckingham Palace, the queen’s London residence and a seat of 
today’s royal power and intrigue.
 
✓ If you missed the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace or 
want another dose of that royal pomp and pageantry, Windsor 
Castle is less than an hour away. Reputedly the queen’s favorite 
castle, Windsor has a 900-year history that stretches back to the 
time of William the Conqueror. Many of the rooms that you visit 
today were remodeled in the time of Queen Victoria.
 
✓ Hampton Court Palace is one of the most magnificent of former 
royal palaces, and you can easily get there in 30 minutes by train 
from Central London (or, more romantically, by taking a boat on 
the Thames). In addition to visiting dozens of staterooms in this 
16th-century Tudor palace, where Henry VIII once resided, you can 
enjoy the splendid gardens with their famous maze.
 
✓ Although you can’t see the rooms where the late Princess Diana 
actually lived, you can get into her former home, Kensington 
Palace, situated at the western side of Kensington Gardens. In addi-
tion to the vast, visitable staterooms, this mostly 18th-century 
palace, where Victoria was born in 1819, houses a remarkable cos-
tume exhibit that includes royal raiment through the ages.
 
✓ Occupying a spot right on the River Thames, the Houses of 
Parliament and their landmark clock tower containing Big Ben 
have been a familiar sight to Londoners for over 150 years. In the 
summer, fascinating tours of this seat of power let you see the 
House of Commons and the House of Lords. Or you can just admire 
the buildings from the outside and wait for the hourly boom of 
Big Ben.
 
✓ St. Paul’s Cathedral, with its landmark dome, is dear to the hearts 
of Londoners and is used for events of national significance. A mas-
terpiece by the architect Sir Christopher Wren, the cathedral was 
built following the Great Fire that swept through London in 1666.

 Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of London 11
The Best Museums
If you’re a dedicated museum maven, London’s selection will keep you 
going for days, weeks, months, even years. This city is loaded with every 
conceivable kind of treasure from all over the world. And, amazingly 
enough, entrance to all the great national museums is free. You can read 
more about all of London’s top museums in Chapter 11. Here are the 
best of the best:
 
✓ The venerable British Museum, with its unparalleled collection of 
antiquities, comes out on top — the magnificent Parthenon sculptures 
(formerly called the Elgin Marbles) understandably hold pride of place 
there, but you’ll be amazed by the superlative Egyptian and Roman 
collections, as well as the ancient treasures unearthed in England.
Pomp, ceremony, and scandal: The royals
In London, the royals are spied on the way movie stars are in the United States. The 
paparazzi furor lessened a bit after Princess Diana’s death, but it still exists. From the 
queen on down, the monarchy is a huge business (they actually call themselves “The 
Firm”), and you can’t avoid it. Buy a London paper any day in London, and you can find 
some juicy tidbit about Prince Charles, his new wife Camilla Parker-Bowles (the 
Duchess of Cornwall), Prince William, Prince Andrew, Prince Harry, Princess Anne, or 
some other member of The Firm. (I provide a few juicy items of my own in this book with 
my London Tattler asides.)
I never gave much thought to royalty, except as a footnote to history, until one day, 
years ago, when I was passing St. James’s Palace and saw Princess Diana and 
Princess Anne being hustled into a waiting limo. There they were, two princesses, 
going about the mysterious routines of royalty. I saw them for maybe three seconds and 
stood there like a slack-jawed yokel as the limo pulled away.
In 2009, I had an opportunity to tour Buckingham Palace with a group of travel journalists 
and meet Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s husband. It was a memorable experience, but 
not in the way I’d anticipated. Minutes before I was due to shake the royal hand, I made 
my way to the palace loo. It was impressively posh, with yellow patterned wallpaper, a 
clothes brush in an illuminated alcove, gleaming white porcelain urinals, a full-length 
mirror, and spotless sinks surrounded by wood and marble. All was fine until I pressed 
down on the soap dispenser to wash my hands, and huge white gobs of soap shot out and 
covered one arm and the side of my new suit. Frantically, with only moments to spare, I 
brushed away the offending gobs and hurried back to the reception room to meet the 
prince. “Do I look all right?” I whispered to a colleague standing beside me. “Fine,” she 
said, “except half of your suit’s all wet.” In any event, the prince didn’t notice. His 88th 
birthday was that day, and it was apparent that the last thing he wanted to do was shake 
the hands of 70 strangers. After a few brusque comments, he left our group and then 
turned back to ask, “What is it you all do again?” “We’re travel writers,” I piped up. The 
prince gave us a royal once-over and said, “Oh. Haven’t we got enough of those already?”

✓ The National Gallery houses the nation’s greatest collection of 
British and European paintings from the 13th through the 20th 
centuries. Here, you find works by Italian masters, such as 
Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael; canvases by every great French 
Impressionist; a stunning Rembrandt collection; and paintings by 
great British artists, such as Turner and Constable.
 
✓ If you tire of the great Western European masterworks hanging in 
the National Gallery, you can walk next door to see images of pop 
icons like Elton John and Princess Di in the National Portrait 
Gallery. Here, you find a visual who’s who of every famous Brit in 
history, captured in paint, stone, bronze, and photographs.
 
✓ Keen on decorative and applied arts? Then head over to the 
Victoria and Albert Museum, a linchpin in the cluster of great 
South Kensington museums. The V&A, as it’s called, houses won-
derfully decorated period rooms, a comprehensive fashion collec-
tion, Italian Renaissance sculpture, and acres more.
 
✓ The other two outstanding museums in South Kensington are the 
Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. Animatronic 
dinosaurs, including a hungry T. rex, are the cold-blooded stars in 
the Natural History Museum’s famed dinosaur exhibit; but while 
you’re there, check out the mind-boggling collection of gems. In the 
Science Museum, you come face to face with legends from the 
world of science and technology.
 
✓ London’s South Bank is buzzing with the addition of the stunning 
Tate Modern. Housed in a former power station on the river, the 
museum exhibits an international roster of contemporary greats.
 
✓ Tate Britain holds the world’s greatest collection of British art. 
Wander through rooms filled with works by William Blake, Turner, 
Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Constable, and all the pre-Raphaelites.
 
✓ London lovers will love the Museum of London, probably the 
world’s most comprehensive city museum, which features an amaz-
ing collection of Roman antiquities (the museum incorporates part 
of a 2,000-year-old Roman wall) and tells the fascinating story of 
London through the ages.
 
✓ You can also enjoy masterpieces in museums that were built as pri-
vate palaces, such as Spencer House, former home of Princess 
Diana’s family; Apsley House, home of the first Duke of Wellington; 
and Hertford House, home of the Wallace Collection, a national 
museum.
The Best of British Cuisine
Once upon a time, you could always count on getting lousy meals in 
London. The nation’s dull, insular, uninspired cooking was the joke of 
Europe. That reputation began to change in the 1980s, with the influx of 
new cooking trends that favored foods from France and Italy. Since then, 

 Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of London 13
London has become a food capital (allegedly with more Michelin-starred 
restaurants than Paris). For a handy reference guide to English cuisine, 
see the Cheat Sheet for this book, located at www.dummies.com/
cheatsheet/london. You can find all my top London restaurants in 
Chapter 10. Here are my picks for the best that the London dining scene 
has to offer:
 
✓ London is the best place to find restaurants serving inventive 
Modern British cuisine. Reserve a table at Rules, Corrigan’s 
Mayfair, Langan’s Bistro, or Boxwood Cafe — to name just a 
few — and let your taste buds do the talking.
 
✓ Traditionalists need not despair: All those wonderful old English 
faves are still around — eggs, kippers, beans, and fried tomatoes 
for breakfast; bubble and squeak; roast beef and Yorkshire pudding; 
meat pies; fish and chips; toad in the hole; cottage pie; sticky toffee 
pudding; and trifle. You find the old English comfort foods at pubs 
and restaurants such as Stockpot, Founders Arms, Simpson’s-in-
the-Strand, Porters English Restaurant, Canteen, and many others.
 
✓ Some would say that Indian cooking is the new national cuisine of 
England. Well, it’s certainly one of multiethnic London’s faves, and 
Indian restaurants are often far more affordable than your other 
options. Like other cuisines, Indian cooking in England has been 
undergoing many transformations. Veeraswamy is the oldest Indian 
restaurant in London, but the interior is cool and contemporary. You 
can also find great Indian cooking at Mela and Noor Jahan.
 
✓ If French cooking is your idea of heaven, you won’t lack for dining 
options in London. Both traditional and nouvelle French restau-
rants remain alive and well. You may want to try the OXO Tower 
Brasserie, with its stunning river views, or Brasserie St. Quentin.
 
✓ And don’t forget that London boasts more ethnic restaurants than 
anywhere else in the United Kingdom, so almost any kind of cuisine 
can be on the tip of your tongue. For delectable tapas and Spanish/
Moroccan food, go to Moro. For slurpy and superlative Japanese 
noodles, head for Wagamama. For fresh New Zealand mussels and 
the most delicious New Zealand dessert, known as Pavlova, Suze in 
Mayfair is your best bet.
The Best Places to Shop in London
It’s not just my credit cards talking: I’m here to tell you that London is 
one of the world’s great shopping cities — possibly the greatest. Why? 
The sheer variety of what’s available.
Trend-setting London is to the United Kingdom what New York City is to 
the United States: the place where it happens first (or ultimately ends 
up). London is where you can eyeball what’s hot, British style. You see 
the latest hard-core street fashions side by side with the quintessentially 
traditional.

Part I: Introducing London 
14
Not into new? In London, you can hunt for an old engraving, try on a 
cocktail dress from the ’50s, paw through bric-a-brac at an outdoor 
market stall, or wander through the London silver vaults in your quest 
for a Georgian soup ladle.
For my complete rundown of London shopping, see Chapter 12. Here are 
some hints on finding London’s best stores and shopping districts:
 
✓ Is Harrods the most famous department store in the world? Quite 
possibly so. See for yourself whether it deserves all the hype. And 
be sure to visit the Food Halls.
 
✓ Fortnum & Mason is the queen’s London grocer, and it’s probably 
the only store in the world where you see cans of soup displayed 
on wooden shelves along carpeted aisles. Other departments 
include china, crystal, leather, antiques, and stationery — plus, you 
can dine at the store’s famous restaurants.
 
✓ Shopaholics hold Oxford Street in very high regard. Lined with 
major department stores like Selfridges and Marks & Spencer, and 
chockablock with dozens upon dozens of moderate to upscale 
shops, it’s a rendezvous point for shoppers of all ages from all over 
the world. Motto: Big Names, Reasonable Prices.
 
✓ Knightsbridge is a flash-and-cash point of the highest order, home 
of the aforementioned Harrods, the smaller Harvey Nichols, and 
numerous luxurious designer boutiques where real and wannabe 
aristocrats shop for “the season.”
 
✓ Time and money just fly when you visit the super-chic boutiques of 
Covent Garden, Bond Street, and King’s Road in Chelsea. In these 
certified shopping zones, you can find everything a true fashionista 
could ever want.
 
✓ Hidden away from the hoi polloi, the 200-year-old shops on Jermyn 
Street cater to traditionalists who want the finest goods available. 
Many of the shops on Jermyn Street have Royal Warrants — that 
is, they’re allowed to advertise that they sell to the royal family. 
Look for custom-made shirts and suits, hand-tooled leather shoes, 
and fabulous toiletry shops, such as Floris and Taylors of Old 
Bond Street.
 
✓ What reader wouldn’t be tempted by the wonderland of bookstores 
on Charing Cross Road? It’s a reader’s feast and a browser’s para-
dise, with major U.K. bookstores like W & G Foyle offering tens of 
thousands of titles.
The Best of London’s Performing Arts
London is a world capital, and that includes being a world capital of the 
performing arts. When the sun goes down, the curtain goes up. For a 

 Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of London 15
description of London’s major performing-arts venues and companies, 
see Chapter 15. Here are my recommendations for the very best.
 
✓ For many visitors, going to the theater is reason enough to go to 
London. When actors of the highest caliber are on the boards — as 
they always are in London — you don’t need to think twice about 
going to the theater; you just go. The London theater scene is phe-
nomenal, and prices are lower than in New York. Take your pick: 
long-running international-hit musicals, light comedies, hard-hitting 
dramas, new works in “fringe” venues, everything from William 
Shakespeare to Oscar Wilde to Neil LaBute and beyond.
 
✓ Opera buffs appreciate the fact that London has two major opera 
companies. International stars appear at the historic Royal Opera 
in Covent Garden, where operas are performed in their original lan-
guages. A few blocks away is the English National Opera, where 
every opera is sung in English, mostly by British performers, and 
the productions tend to be more adventuresome.
 
✓ Every night, lovers of classical music have an embarrassment of 
riches to choose from. London is home to several world-class sym-
phony orchestras. The London Symphony Orchestra plays at the 
Barbican Centre, where good seats cost as little as £15 ($25). The 
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra performs at Cadogan Hall and the 
Royal Albert Hall. The newly refurbished Royal Festival Hall is 
home to four resident orchestras: the London Philharmonic, the 
Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta, and the 
Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. Other renowned U.K. and 
European orchestras perform regularly in the city, as do interna-
tionally known chamber-music ensembles. A summer highlight is 
the Proms concerts at Royal Albert Hall, featuring an international 
roster of the best orchestras and soloists in the world.
 
✓ Dance aficionados can enjoy an evening at the Royal Ballet and/or 
the English National Ballet, both of which have regular London 
seasons. Smaller dance companies, from traditional to cutting edge, 
are at home in venues throughout the city.
The Best Urban Charms
London is one great city that has actually gotten better over the years. 
In deference to the millennium year 2000, the city dusted itself off and 
spruced itself up in ways that have benefited residents and visitors alike. 
Old museums (such as the Great Court in the British Museum) have 
been revamped with stunning results, and new museums (such as the 
Tate Modern; see “The Best Museums,” earlier in this chapter) have 
opened. Sleek, new bridges now span the Thames, and riverside areas 
have seen a flurry of development. Trafalgar Square has been joined to 
the National Gallery, making pedestrian access a breeze rather than a 
chore, and the South Bank Centre has undergone a major transformation

that has made it more people-friendly than ever. All in all, London has 
shaken off its old mantle of hidebound traditionalism, has embraced 
multiculturalism, and is now high tech and cutting edge.
But the old fabric of London persists and invites exploration. Despite all 
the improvements in public transit, London remains a city where walk-
ing is a joy that reveals no end of simple urban pleasures. Here are the 
best among them:
 
✓ London is blessed with marvelous parks. You may have heard of 
them: Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, St. James’s Park, Green 
Park, and Regent’s Park (all described in Chapter 11). These care-
fully groomed havens, where you can stroll beneath stately trees, 
lounge on the grass, watch ducks in a pond, or admire the color of 
the springtime daffodils, were former royals-only hunting grounds. 
Now they’re part of every Londoner’s life and life’s blood, the green 
lungs of an otherwise congested city.
 
✓ What could be more fun than just wandering around London’s 
streets? Try it. Pick a neighborhood — the City, Soho, Chelsea — 
and then just stroll at will, taking note of the wealth of architectural 
styles, the curious reminders of days gone by, and the array of 
local sights, such as the blue, “famous-person-lived-here” plaques 
on house fronts. On some streets, you can almost hear the horses’ 
hooves clopping on the cobblestones as they did up until about 
1915.
 
✓ The South Bank and Southwark areas on the “other” side of the 
river have been opened for pedestrians and show off an ancient 
area of London that’s been completely revitalized. You can enjoy a 
waterside walk with city views from Westminster Bridge to Tower 
Bridge.
 
✓ The variety of architectural styles adds to the beauty of the city. 
Because the Great Fire of 1666 burned down most of medieval 
London, the building and house styles that you see tend to range 
from the sober neoclassical of the early 18th century, to the more 
elegantly light-hearted Regency style of the early 19th century, to 
the heavier and less graceful Victorian period of the mid- to late 
19th century. The human scale of London streets, with their long 
terraces of attached brick, stone, and stucco homes built around 
leafy squares, gives the city a charm and character that intrigue 
and delight the eye. London grew from a series of villages, and you 
can still find that villagelike character in many London neighbor-
hoods. (For a list of those neighborhoods, see Chapter 8, and for 
more on London architecture, turn to Chapter 2.)

T
his chapter helps you find out more about London and deepens your 
experience of England. I distill the essence of London’s complicated 
and tumultuous past so you can get a clear, quick sense of the major 
epochs. Then I highlight the main architectural trends, whet your appe-
tite with a primer on English food and drink, and recommend some 
excellent books and movies about the capital of the United Kingdom.
The Main Events: A Brief History of London
London’s history is inextricably intertwined with the larger history of 
England. Endless tomes have been written on individual monarchs, col-
orful personalities, architectural styles, and historical epochs in English 
history. But I’m going to be as brief as a bikini and give you a history 
that covers only the bare essentials in the following sections.
Prehistory and the arrival of the Romans
Over 2,500 years ago, a Celtic tribe was living beside the River Thames 
in the region that would later become London.
When the Romans conquered England in A.D. 43, they suppressed or sub-
dued the local Celts. The legendary Queen Boudicca (or Boadicea) was a 
Celtic warrior queen who fought back the invading Romans. (You can 
see a statue of her on Westminster Bridge in London.) The Romans 
brought their building and engineering skills to England and erected a 
2.6-sq.-km (1-sq.-mile) fort they called Londinium. This small settlement 
eventually became the City of London, the earliest area to be developed. 
In the City, you can still see the remains of Roman walls and a temple 
where Roman soldiers worshipped a Persian god called Mithras (see 
Chapter 18).

Northern invaders
With the Roman Empire’s breakup in A.D. 410, Jutes, Angles, and Saxons 
from Northern Europe invaded England and formed small kingdoms. For 
the next 600 years or so, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms fought off Viking 
raiders. The capital of England at the time was in Winchester, in the 
Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Because of its strategic position on the 
Thames, London grew as an important center of trade.
William the Conqueror
The next major transitional period in England — and London — started 
in 1066, when William of Normandy (1028–87) fought and killed Harold, 
the Anglo-Saxon king of England, at the Battle of Hastings. William and 
his French nobles took over the land, moved their power base to 
London, and built fortified castles — including Windsor Castle and the 
Tower of London (both described in Chapter 11) — that still stand 
today. Every monarch up to the present day claims descent from 
William the Conqueror and, like him, has been crowned at Westminster 
Cathedral (see Chapter 11) in London.
The Magna Carta
King John, a Plantagenet, signed the Magna Carta in 1215, granting 
more rights to the nobles. What about the common man and woman? 
As serfs and vassals in a closed, hierarchical, class-ridden society, their 
lot wasn’t an easy one. Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400), who lived and 
worked in London, was the first writer to give us some recognizable por-
traits of folks who lived during the medieval period, in The Canterbury 
Tales.
Three Hundred Years of War
At home and abroad, war and bloodshed tore England apart for more 
than 300 years. The Hundred Years’ War between France and England 
began in 1337. The War of the Roses, fought between the House of York 
and the House of Lancaster, raged from 1455 to 1487.
Tudor and Elizabethan England
Henry VIII, the Tudor king famous for taking six wives, brought about the 
next great shift in what had been Catholic England. In 1534, he dissolved 
all the monasteries and became head of the Church of England. He 
nabbed Hampton Court Palace (see Chapter 11) from Cardinal Wolsey 
and made it one of his royal residences. Henry’s second wife, Anne 
Boleyn, was beheaded at the Tower of London in 1536. Henry and Anne 
Boleyn’s daughter, Elizabeth I, ruled during a period of relative peace, 
power, and prosperity. The Elizabethan period was England’s Golden 
Age, the time when Shakespeare’s plays were being performed at the 
Globe Theatre (see Chapter 15) in London.

 Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 19
Civil War
In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King James I (1566–1625) of England, 
uniting the crowns of England and Scotland. But conflicts between mon-
archs and nobles were endless. Charles I (1600–49), seeking absolute 
power, dissolved Parliament in 1629. He was beheaded in London after 
Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658) led a bitter civil war between Royalists and 
Parliamentarians. Cromwell’s armies destroyed churches and Royalist 
strongholds throughout the country. Cromwell was elevated to Lord 
Protector of the Realm, but by 1660 a new king, Charles II (1630–85), was 
on the throne. This time, however, his powers were limited.
Fire, plague, and rebuilding
London, which had been growing steadily, was devastated by two back-
to-back catastrophes, the Great Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of 1666.
Under the brilliant architect Sir Christopher Wren (1632–1723), a new 
London emerged from the ashes of the Great Fire. Brick and stone 
replaced timber as the primary building material. Wren’s masterpiece, 
St. Paul’s Cathedral (see Chapter 11), was built on the site of the old 
cathedral, and dozens of Wren churches were erected in the City of 
London. England’s steadily growing naval might was centered at 
Greenwich (see Chapter 11), where Wren designed the Royal Naval 
College, today a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
New lines of succession
When James II (1633–1701) tried to reinstate Catholicism in England, he 
was deposed in 1688 and succeeded by his daughter Mary (1662–94) and 
William of Orange (1650–1702), thus ensuring a Protestant line of succes-
sion. William and Mary renovated and lived in Kensington Palace (see 
Chapter 11). The children of Queen Anne (1665–1714), the next mon-
arch, predeceased her, leaving the kingdom without an heir when Anne 
died. George of Hanover (1660–1727) was chosen to be the next king of 
England, thus ushering in the reign of the Hanoverians, who preceded 
Victoria.
The Victorian Empire
England reached its zenith of power and prestige during the reign of 
Victoria (1837–1901), who ruled over an empire so vast that “the sun 
never set” on it. Victoria was born at Kensington Palace and moved to 
the grander Buckingham Palace (see Chapter 11) when she was crowned 
in 1837. Following the death of her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-
Coburg, the queen had the Albert Memorial (see Chapter 11) erected in 
Kensington Gardens, where it still stands.
The Industrial Revolution spawned major societal changes during 
this period, moving England away from its agrarian past and into a 

Part I: Introducing London 
20
mechanized future. Charles Dickens (1812–70) and other social reform-
ers exposed the wretched working and living conditions in Victorian 
London and throughout England. After a fire, the Houses of Parliament 
were rebuilt and reopened in 1857. The late Victorian Age was the time 
of Sherlock Holmes, a fictional London detective created by Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle, and Jack the Ripper, a real-life serial killer who terrorized 
London’s East End.
England in the world wars
England suffered terrible losses during World War I (1914–18) but 
emerged victorious. During World War II, from the fall of France in 1940 
until the United States entered the war in 1941, England stood alone 
against Hitler. Winston Churchill (1874–1965), the country’s prime minis-
ter during the war years, frequently held cabinet meetings in a secret 
warren of underground rooms called the Cabinet War Rooms (see 
Chapter 11), which are preserved just as they were during his tenure. 
With strictly rationed food, mandatory blackouts, and terrible bombing 
raids that destroyed whole sections of London and killed tens of thou-
sands of civilians, life in wartime London had a profound effect on its cit-
izens. Shortages continued for many years afterward.
The welfare state
A major societal shift occurred in 1945 when the Labour Party began to 
dismantle the empire and introduced the welfare state. Under the National 
Health System, every citizen in the United Kingdom can receive free 
healthcare. It wasn’t until Margaret Thatcher and the Tory Party came into 
power during the 1980s that England began privatizing formerly state-run 
agencies, such as the railroad (with what some say are disastrous results).
Queen Elizabeth II
Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne in 1952. The fairy-tale wedding of 
her son Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer at St. Paul’s Cathedral in 
1981 was the last high point for the House of Windsor (which changed 
its name from the German Saxe-Coburg during World War II). Charles 
and Diana’s subsequent divorce seemed to unleash a floodgate of royal 
scandals; as a result, the popularity of the British monarchy is at an all-
time low. Following her divorce, Diana (1961–97) lived at Kensington 
Palace (see Chapter 11), where grieving Londoners left a sea of floral 
tributes following her death in a car crash.
In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 50th anniversary on the throne.
London at the millennium
In anticipation of the year 2000, London went on an all-out public-
relations blitz to show the world that “Rule, Britannia” had become 
“Cool Britannia.” The giant Millennium Dome was a giant fiasco, but the 
London Eye (see Chapter 11), an enormous observation wheel, remains 
one of London’s most popular attractions.

 Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 21
Mayor Ken and Mayor Boris
In 2000, Ken Livingstone, former Labour member of Parliament, was 
elected to the newly created post of mayor of London (not to be con-
fused with the lord mayor of London, an ancient ceremonial position in 
the City of London). During his controversial tenure — he was elected 
for a second term in 2004 — Mayor Ken instituted major changes in the 
public transportation system, including the introduction of London’s 
congestion charge, a fee that any driver entering Central London during 
specific hours of the day must pay. He was succeeded in 2008 by Boris 
Johnson, a controversial figure who once wrote for The Daily Telegraph. 
It’s too early to talk of Mayor Boris’s legacy, but he is keen on green, 
wants to extend the congestion-charge traffic zone, and promotes 
bicycling.
New Labour
In 2001, Tony Blair was elected to a second term as prime minister, and 
New Labour, with its centrist approach, was firmly in control of the gov-
ernment. But in the 2005 elections, the party lost one-third of its seats, 
as voters expressed their discontent with Blair’s continuing support of 
the U.S.-led war in Iraq. Blair stepped down as prime minister in 2007 
and was succeeded by Gordon Brown.
London and the rest of the United Kingdom were rocked in 2009 by an 
expenses scandal that seemed to implicate almost every member of 
Parliament. Never popular, Brown’s already low approval ratings plum-
meted even further. As of this writing, there’s no telling whether Brown 
will remain in office much longer.
Terrorist bombings
In July 2005, one day after exultant Londoners learned that their city had 
been chosen to host the 2012 Olympic Games, terrorists detonated 
bombs in the London Underground and on a double-decker bus, killing 
56 people and wounding hundreds more. Londoners stood together and 
carried on, showing the world that they would not be cowed by acts of 
violence. A second bombing attempt a week later failed but had tragic 
consequences when police shot and killed an innocent man suspected of 
terrorism. In July 2007, police foiled another terrorist plot when they 
defused bombs in two cars parked in Central London.
2012 Summer Olympics
In 2012, London will play host to the Summer Olympics, a highly antici-
pated event that will take place in newly built venues in Stratford East, 
an area east of Canary Wharf. The upcoming Olympics have spurred the 
construction of several new hotels and will result in a selective facelift of 
the entire city, with new additions to its transportation infrastructure. 
Will it be the smash London hopes it will be? Or an embarrassing, poorly 
attended fiasco like the Millennium Dome? Time will tell.

Twenty-first-century royals
In 2005, Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, finally married his long-time mis-
tress, Camilla Parker-Bowles, in a ceremony that his mother, Queen Elizabeth, did not 
attend. The wedding was somewhat anticlimactic because Charles had been involved 
with Camilla throughout his marriage to Princess Diana. On the first anniversary of his 
marriage to Camilla, Charlie read a poll in the Times indicating that 56 percent of Britons 
did not wish to see his new wife become queen. She will, though, unless the govern-
ments of England and 15 Commonwealth nations change the law. In the meantime, the 
pre-queen is addressed as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall. Many Britons 
call her something far less flattering, though most grudgingly admit that she is a hard 
worker. The trouble is, she simply has no charisma.
As the ever-popular Elizabeth enters her twilight years (she turned 83 in 2009), some 
Britons wonder if the 1,000-year-old British monarchy should end with her — especially 
with the unpopular Charles next in line for the throne. Just 37 percent of Britons think 
that Charles should succeed his mother, according to a 2007 poll. In fact, the poll found 
that 39 percent would prefer that Charles’s elder son, Prince William, leapfrog his father 
for the crown. And speaking of crowns, a bill was recently introduced in Parliament to 
end discrimination against women inheriting the throne. As the ancient “male primo-
geniture” law now stands, the line of succession is always male and women become 
monarchs only when every other male option has been exhausted. What that means 
practically is that Princess Anne, Elizabeth’s second child, is 11th in line to the throne, 
after all her brothers and all her brothers’ children (including females), when she should 
be fourth (after Charles and his two sons).
Poor Charles just can’t seem to do anything to win him the respect enjoyed by his 
mother, although he gained some public support in 2009 when he managed to put the 
kibosh on a new architectural project by Richard Rogers that would have turned the 
venerable Chelsea Barracks into a futuristic tower. That was offset by news that his 
income had increased dramatically but not his taxes, and that he and Camilla had spent 
a king’s ransom traveling the world as royal ambassadors. In 2007, Charles was accused 
by some members of Parliament of overstepping the traditional bounds imposed on the 
royal family of not interfering in political matters. Soon after, Charles had to read about 
his second son, Prince Harry, partying with lap dancers as he and his class at the 
Sandhurst military academy finished training. Harry’s tarnished reputation regained 
some of its luster after he served in Afghanistan, but Charles remains a polarizing figure.
In comparison to his younger brother, Prince William, tall and blond like his late mother, 
Diana, stays out of trouble and is, by all accounts, quiet and well mannered. The only 
semi-bad press William received in 2007 was when he broke off his four-year relation-
ship with Kate Middleton, presumably because her blood wasn’t blue enough. Though 
her parents are self-made millionaires, Kate’s mother had once worked as a flight atten-
dant. According to the tabloids, William started to pine for Kate almost as soon as he 
dumped her, and the two were seen together just two months after their breakup. Now 
it just seems a matter of time before William pops the question to the woman known as 
“Waity Katy.” But a royal proposal is no ordinary “Will you marry me?” query on bended 
knee. It’s hugely complicated and even has to be vetted by the prime minister. In the 

 Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 23
meantime, until the question is popped and the official announcement is made, Kate has 
reportedly been working hard to please her toughest critic, Queen Elizabeth II, who has 
demanded numerous times that Kate find her own job.
The queen, ever a credit to her country, hasn’t been involved in a PR scuffle since 2007, 
when the BBC showed a film clip of her purportedly storming out of a sitting with pho-
tographer Annie Leibovitz after Leibovitz asked Her Maj to remove her crown. It turned 
out that the BBC had manipulated the film footage to suit its story, and it was forced to 
apologize. Soon after, Prince Philip, the queen’s husband, denied reports that he had 
ever called Diana a “harlot” and a “trollop.” Stay tuned. . . .
Building Blocks: An Overview 
of English Architecture
The period in which a building was constructed (or reconstructed), is 
found in its architectural and decorative details. In a country like 
England, where the age of buildings can span a thousand-year period (a 
few Anglo-Saxon churches are even older than that), many different 
styles evolved. The architectural periods are often named for the mon-
arch or royal family reigning at the time. Knowing a few things about the 
key features of the different styles of London’s abundance of historic 
buildings will add an entirely new perspective to your trip. Keep in mind 
that little remains from before the Great Fire of 1666, which destroyed 
most of London — Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London are the 
two most notable exceptions.
The following list gives you a brief primer in English architectural his-
tory from Norman to Victorian times:
 
✓ Norman (1066–1189): Round arches, barrel vaults, and highly dec-
orated archways characterize this period’s Romanesque style.
 
✓ Early English Gothic (1189–1272): The squat, bulky buildings of 
the Norman period gave way to the taller, lighter buildings con-
structed in this style.
 
✓ Decorated Gothic (1272–1377): Buildings in this style have large 
windows with tracery (ornamental stonework with branching lines) 
and heavily decorated gables and arches.
 
✓ Perpendicular Gothic (1377–1483): Large buttresses (exterior side 
supports) allowed churches to have larger windows than ever 
before. Tracery became more elaborate than in previous Gothic 
buildings, the four-centered arch appeared, and fan vaulting (a 
decorative form of vaulting in which the structural ribs spread 
upward and outward along the ceiling, like the rays of a fan) was 
perfected.

24
 
✓ Tudor (1485–1553): During this period, buildings evolved from 
Gothic to Renaissance styles. Large houses and palaces were built 
with a new material: brick. England has many half-timbered Tudor 
and Elizabethan domestic and commercial buildings. This method 
of construction used brick and plaster between visible wooden 
timbers.
 
✓ Elizabethan (1553–1603): The Renaissance brought a revival of 
classical features, such as columns, cornices (prominent rooflines 
with brackets and other details), and pediments (decorative trian-
gular features over doorways and windows). The many large 
houses and palaces of this period were built in an E or H shape and 
contained long galleries, grand staircases, and carved chimneys.
 
✓ Jacobean (1603–25): In England, Inigo Jones used the symmetrical, 
classically inspired Palladian style that arrived from Italy. Buildings 
in this style incorporate elements from ancient Greece and Rome.
 
✓ Stuart (1625–88): Elegant classical features, such as columns, 
cornices, and pediments, are typical of this period, in which Sir 
Christopher Wren was the preeminent architect.
 
✓ Queen Anne (1689–1714): Buildings from the English baroque 
period mix heavy ornamentation with classical simplicity.
 
✓ Georgian and Regency (1714–1830): During these periods, elegant 
terraced houses were built; many examples survive in Brighton and 
Bath. Form and proportion were important elements; interior deco-
ration inspired by Chinese motifs became fashionable.
 
✓ Victorian (1830–1901): A whole range of antique styles emerged — 
everything from Gothic and Greek Revival to pseudo-Egyptian 
and -Elizabethan. Hundreds of English churches were renovated 
during the Victorian era.
 
✓ Modern, postmodern, and contemporary (1946–present): Massive 
destruction in World War II bombing raids meant rebuilding entire 
sections of London. International modernism, adapted from 
European models, resulted in sleeker and simpler facades. The 
most iconic building from the modernist era is Royal Festival Hall, 
built on the South Bank for the Festival of Britain in 1951. 
Gargantuan and ungainly postmodern office buildings went up in 
the City (London’s financial center) in the 1980s, borrowing archi-
tectural styles and elements from earlier and more gracefully 
coherent epochs. In the past decade, buildings by designer archi-
tects have popped up on the London skyline, most notably the 
Gherkin, a pickle-shaped City office tower, and the new London City 
Hall, a rounded glass building on the South Bank near Tower 
Bridge, both designed by Lord Norman Foster.

Dining English Style, from 
Traditional to Modern
London’s dining scene can satisfy any taste and budget, and it’s the best 
place to find restaurants serving inventive modern British and ethnic 
cuisines of every sort. In fact, spicy Indian cooking is England’s second 
“national” cuisine. Scores of Indian and other ethnic restaurants 
throughout the city mean there is always something new to try.
But traditionalists in search of all those wonderful old English faves 
won’t be at a loss. It’s true that many Londoners now opt for a latte and 
a muffin at Starbucks for their breakfast, but you can still find places 
that serve a good greasy fry-up with eggs, kippers, beans, and fried 
tomatoes. And old comfort foods like bubble and squeak (mashed pota-
toes mixed with cabbage) and bangers and mash (sausages with mashed 
potatoes) are still around, too. The great traditional “roasts” are served 
at places like Simpson’s-in-the-Strand, where a server at your table will 
slice your roast beef or roast lamb and dish up your Yorkshire pudding. 
When traditional, non-fancy English dishes are done well, they’re super-
satisfying and delicious.
Other traditional dishes loved by Londoners include meat and fish pies, 
shepherd’s pie (ground beef topped with mashed potatoes and baked), 
and fish and chips. And for dessert? At restaurants like Porter’s English 
Restaurant, you can still find sticky toffee pudding (sponge cake smoth-
ered in warm butterscotch sauce), spotted dick (steamed, raisin-filled 
sponge cake covered with custard), and trifle (sherry-soaked sponge 
cake layered with raspberry preserves, covered with custard sauce, and 
topped with whipped cream).
While you’re in London, you can also look forward to the world of after-
noon tea. Teas can be as simple or as fancy as you want — nothing more 
than a cup of tea and a pastry in a patisserie, or an elaborate affair with 
scones, clotted or whipped cream, preserves, cakes, and sandwiches.
See Chapter 10 for a list of my recommended London restaurants and 
spots for tea, and check out the Cheat Sheet found at www.dummies.
com/cheatsheet/london for a glossary of English food terms.
Visiting the Local Pub
The pub (short for public house) is an English institution. London is 
awash with historic pubs, where you can sit all evening with a pint of 
ale, bitter, stout, or cider, and soak up the local color. You can even do 

Part I: Introducing London 
26
a pub crawl, walking (upright) from pub to pub and sampling the diverse 
brews on tap. Although you can get a hard drink at both bars and pubs, 
when you’re in a pub, you’re better off confining yourself to beer.
 
 Parliament has instituted the strict hours that most pubs adhere to: 
Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon 
to 10:30 p.m. Americans, take note: You never tip the bartender in a pub; 
the best you can do is offer to buy him or her a drink — an acceptable 
practice in England. Ten minutes before closing, a bell rings, signaling that 
the time has come to order your last round.
Pubs may be an institution, but some would say they are a dying one. 
Nonsmoking laws and changing social patterns are taking their toll, and 
in 2009, it was estimated that some 2,000 pubs would close throughout 
England.
A beer primer: Are you bitter or stout?
Most of the pubs in London and throughout the United Kingdom are tied to a particular 
brewery and sell only that brewery’s beers. (You see the name of the brewery on the 
sign outside.) Independent pubs can sell more brands than a tied pub. Either way, you 
still have to choose from what may seem like a bewildering variety. The colorful names 
of individual brews don’t provide much help — you can only wonder what Pigswill, 
Dogs Bollocks, Hobgoblin, Old Thumper, Pommies Revenge, or Boondoggle taste like. 
Depending on all sorts of factors — the water, the hops, the fermentation technique, 
and so on — the brewery crafts the taste of any beer, whether on draught or in a bottle. 
You can get a few U.S. and international brands, but imports are more expensive than 
the home brew.
When ordering beer in a pub, specify the type, the brand, and the amount (pint or half-
pint) you want. Asking the bartender to recommend something based on your taste 
preferences is perfectly okay. Just remember that most English beer is served at room 
temperature. The following brief descriptions of the most common types of beer will 
come in handy in a pub.
 ✓ Bitter is what most locals drink. It’s a clear, yellowish, traditional beer with a strong 
flavor of hops. Real ale is a bitter that’s still fermenting (“alive”) when it arrives from 
the brewery; it’s pumped and served immediately.
 ✓ Ale isn’t as strong as bitter and has a slightly sweeter taste. You can order light or 
pale ale in a bottle; export ale is a stronger variety.
 ✓ Lager, when chilled, is probably the closest you can come to an American-style 
beer. Lager is available in bottles or on draught.
 ✓ Shandy is equal parts bitter and lemonade (sometimes limeade or ginger beer); it’s 
for those who like a sweet beverage that’s only partially beerlike in taste.
 ✓ Stout is a dark, rich, creamy version of ale. Guinness is the most popular brand. A 
black and tan is half lager and half stout.

Background Check: Finding London 
on Page and Screen
Has any country produced as many great and enduring writers as England 
has? In a brief survey, it’s impossible to even scratch the surface. The 
wonderful thing about London — at least, if you love literature — is that 
it figures in so many great works. All over the city, you encounter blue 
plaques on the fronts of buildings identifying what famous person lived 
there and when. Many of those famous residents were writers. Here are 
a few of my recommendations.
 
✓ The Amorous Nightingale, by Edward Marston: In this detective 
novel, set in London after the Great Fire of 1666, rebuilt Restoration 
London is so strongly evoked that it becomes a character.
 
✓ The Cazalet Chronicles, by Elizabeth Jane Howard: The four 
novels — The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, and Casting Off — 
in this compulsively readable series chronicle the life of a middle-

matic storytelling. If you’ve ever watched British television, you know 
how completely it differs from American TV; the characters actually look 
like human beings and inhabit recognizable worlds.

Chapter 3
Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
▶ Going in season or out
▶ Knowing how rainy it really is
▶ Checking a calendar of special events
L
ondon is one of those cities that’s popular year-round. So popular, 
in fact, that according to VisitBritain, more than 15 million tourists 
from around the globe visited London in 2005 (the last year for which 
figures are available).
 
 Arriving in London at any time of year without advance hotel reservations 
is not a wise idea. If you plan to visit between April and mid-October, 
making hotel reservations in advance is essential. Although you can find 
agencies in London that can help you find a hotel or a B&B in peak season 
(see Chapter 9), you never know quite what you’re getting or where it will 
be, and you lose some of your precious travel time making arrangements. 
In Chapter 9, you can find descriptions of my recommended London 
hotels.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
London weather is what you might call “changeable.” And predicting 
what the weather will be like in any given season is difficult. England is 
an island, after all, and the seas surrounding it, as well as its northerly 
location, determine its weather patterns. In general, however, the cli-
mate is fairly mild year-round, rarely dipping below freezing or rising 
above 27°C (80°F), at least for extended periods.
Table 3-1 gives you an idea of London’s temperature and rainfall varia-
tions. But don’t rely on these figures too much: In 2001, London and the 
rest of England experienced the coldest and wettest winter and spring 
since written records originated in 1659; and in 2007, London and south-
ern England experienced the warmest spring on record. And every 
August from 2003 to 2009, the mercury has soared above normal for 
several days and even reached 32°C (100°F).

London can be drizzly, muggy, dry and hot, or clammy. It can also be glori-
ous, with clear skies and gentle breezes, or bone-chillingly cold. Some days 
you get a bit of everything: rain, spots of sun, drizzle, clear skies, and more 
rain. But whatever the weather, whatever the season, London is well worth 
seeing. The following sections let you know what’s happening in London, 
season by season, so that you can pick the best time to go for you.
Abloom in the spring
London is at its green, blooming best in April and May. Highlights of the 
season include the following:
 
✓ The great London parks and gardens and the surrounding country-
side are at their peak of lushness. The Chelsea Flower Show is the 
quintessential spring event.
 
✓ Airfares are lower than in summer.
 
✓ The sky stays light well into the evening.
 
 But keep in mind these springtime pitfalls:
 
✓ During the half-term school holidays in late February and for three 
weeks around Easter, visitors pour into London. As a result, the 

Part I: Introducing London 
32
major attractions have longer lines (queues in Britspeak), and you 
may have a harder time finding a hotel room.
 
✓ The weather is always unpredictable.
 
✓ Public transportation is reduced during holiday periods.
 
✓ Many museums, stores, and restaurants close on Good Friday, 
Easter, and Easter Monday (the day after Easter).
Summer fun in the sun
Notoriously chilly London becomes irresistible when the sun shines. 
Many tourists flock to London throughout the summer to enjoy the fine 
weather, but that same weather can turn into rain or a fine, gray drizzle 
in July and August. The crowds descend in summer for several reasons:
 
✓ Everyone moves outdoors at the slightest hint of good weather, 
and London buzzes with alfresco theaters, concerts, and festivals 
(see Chapter 15).
 
✓ The evenings are deliciously long and often cool, even if the day 
has been hot.
 
✓ The evening stays light until 10 p.m. or even later.
 
 But keep in mind:
 
✓ If you believe the weather statistics, July and August are the months 
of highest rainfall in London, so skies can stay gray and cloudy.
 
✓ Occasional summer heat waves can drive the mercury toward 30°C, 
35°C, and 40°C (the 80s, 90s, and 100s in Fahrenheit), making July 
and August hot and muggy. Many businesses and budget-class 
hotels don’t have air-conditioning.
 
✓ Aggravated by London’s soot, plus gas and diesel fumes, a hot spell 
can lead to excessive air pollution.
 
✓ Most overseas visitors (30 percent of travelers) converge on the 
city from July through September. Lines for major attractions can 
be interminably long.
 
✓ Airfare sales are rare and tickets are the most expensive during the 
summer peak.
 
✓ Centrally located hotels are more difficult to come by, and their 
high-season rates apply.
 
✓ Booking your hotel in advance is essential during this time of year 
(see Chapter 9).
Chock-full of culture in the fall
The golden glow of autumn casts a lovely spell over London. The air is 
crisp, and the sun gives old stone buildings and church spires a mellow 

 Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 33
patina. Fall is my favorite time of year to be in London, and I can think of 
only one disadvantage to counteract the many advantages, which 
include the following:
 
✓ After mid-September, fewer tourists are around, so the city feels 
less crowded, and you encounter more Londoners than visitors.
 
✓ With the drop in tourism, hotel rates and airfares may go down 
as well.
 
✓ London’s cultural calendar springs to life.
 
✓ Although you may experience rain at this time of year, you’re just 
as likely to encounter what Americans call an “Indian summer,” a 
late stretch of warm weather and clear skies.
 
 One thing to look out for: Like every season in England, autumn can 
bring rain.
Wonderful in winter
Londoners love to be cozy, and there’s no better time for coziness than 
winter. Although most overseas visitors to London arrive during the 
warmer months, the number of visitors from within the United Kingdom 
is highest between January and March. What do they know that you 
should know? Consider the points that make winter wonderful:
 
 
✓ London in winter is a bargain. London’s off-season is November 1 
through December 12 and December 25 through March 14. 
Winter off-season rates for airfares and hotels can sometimes be 
astonishingly low — airline package deals don’t get any cheaper 
(see Chapter 5). At these times, hotel prices can drop by as much 
as 20 percent. If you arrive after the Christmas holidays, you can 
also take advantage of London’s famous post-Christmas sales 
(more on these sales in Chapter 12).
 
✓ Although the winter winds may blow, nothing in London stops — 
in fact, everything gets busier. The arts — theater, opera, concerts, 
and gallery shows — are in full swing.
 
✓ London develops a lovely buzz during the Christmas season: The 
stores are decorated, lights are lit, carols are sung, special holiday 
pantomimes are performed, and the giant Norwegian spruce goes 
up in Trafalgar Square.
 
 Naturally, visiting London in the winter has its downside. Consider these 
points:
 
✓ Although the Yuletide holidays are always jolly, they also add up to 
another peak tourist season from mid-December through Christmas. 
You know what that means: bigger crowds and higher prices. The 
city is virtually shut down on December 25 and 26 and January 1. 
Stores, museums, and other attractions close, and public 

Part I: Introducing London 
34
transportation is severely curtailed. On Boxing Day (December 26), 
you may have problems finding any kind of open restaurant.
 
✓ Wintertime London may be gray and wet for weeks on end; by mid-
winter, the skies get dark by about 3:30 p.m. The English usually 
keep their thermostats set quite low, and rather than turn up the 
heat, they don their woollies (long underwear). You should do the 
same — or be prepared for a chronic case of goose pimples.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
London hums with festivals and special events of all kinds, some harking

Part II
Planning Your 
Trip to London

In this part . . . 
T
his part is all about the nitty-gritty of trip planning. Chapter 4
 helps you manage the money side of your trip — that 
means planning a workable budget based on real prices in 
London and converting your money into English pounds and 
pence when you get there; in this chapter, you can find every-
thing you need to know about using ATMs and credit cards in 
London, as well as how to save money by following a few 
cost-cutting tips. Chapter 5 covers your options for getting to 
London by plane, train, or boat, and it gives you some tips on 
escorted tours and money-saving package tours. Chapter 6 is 
full of special trip-planning advice for London-bound families, 
seniors, travelers with disabilities, and gays and lesbians. 
Chapter 7 goes through some last-minute details, such as get-
ting a passport, dealing with travel and medical insurance, 
staying healthy while you travel, and more.

Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
▶ Planning a realistic budget for your trip
▶ Pricing things in London
▶ Uncovering hidden expenses
▶ Using credit cards, traveler’s checks, and ATMs
▶ Considering money-saving tips
O
kay, you want to go to London. You’re excited and eager to pack, 
but can you really afford it? At this point, a financial reality check 
is in order. London is an expensive city, no two ways about it. But 
adding everything up, a trip to London can cost about the same as a trip 
to New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles. And since the last edition of 
this guide, the dollar has gained considerably against the pound, making 
a London vacation more affordable than it’s been in years.
Planning Your Budget
You can easily budget for your London trip, but holding down costs 
while you’re there may be another matter. (The city’s shopping and 
dining is so enticing — and expensive.) Table 4-1 gives you an idea of 
some basic costs. The sample hotel rates are undiscounted rack rates, 
the highest rate you would pay.

London. But if you stay in an expensive hotel, give the porters who carry 
your bags £1 ($1.65) per bag and doormen who hail you cabs £1 ($1.65) 
per cab.

Transportation
You may think a trip to London is prohibitively expensive because of the 
transatlantic flight, but you can often find bargain airfares to this popu-
lar spot that are cheaper than what you’d pay when flying to the farthest 
reaches of your own country. For more specific information on airlines 
and airfares, see Chapter 5.
I have some other good news that can save you a bundle: You don’t 
need to rent a car in London. (If you want to rent a car to explore the 
areas surrounding London, see Chapter 14.) The London Underground 
(called the Tube) is fast, convenient, and easy to use. Special reduced-
price transportation passes, called London Travelcards and Oysters, 
make getting around the city relatively inexpensive; see Chapter 8 for 
more information.
Lodging
The cost of accommodations takes the biggest bite from your budget. 
Fortunately, because you have to book your rooms well in advance, 
you’ll know this expense before you leave on vacation.
Chapter 8 gives you an idea of London neighborhoods and their suitabil-
ity as your home base. Chapter 9 tells you what you can expect for your 
money, shows you how to get the best rate, and gives you my recom-
mended list of top-notch B&Bs and hotels in all price ranges and locations.
Rates vary considerably according to location and type of hotel or B&B, 
so I can’t really give you a reliable average. For the recommendations in 
this book, however, the rates are generally £100 and under ($165 and 
under) for an inexpensive property, £101 to £150 ($167–$248) for a mod-
erately priced one, £151 to £200 ($249–$330) for an expensive one, and 
£201 to £250 ($332–$413) for a very expensive one. After that, you hit the 
stratosphere of £251-plus ($414-plus) for a luxury B&B or hotel. Keep in 
mind that many midrange London hotels and all B&Bs include at least a 
continental breakfast as part of the room rate, so you can save a few 
pounds there.
 
 The rack rates that I list are not the lowest, special-deal rates that you’ll 
probably be able to find on the hotels’ Web sites. You may be surprised 
at how much you can save off the “official” price of a room.
 
 Britain’s version of a sales tax is called the value-added tax (VAT). Brace 
yourself: The tax amounts to 17.5 percent. The VAT is part of the reason 
that prices in London are so high. The tax is added to the total price 
of consumer goods (the price on the tag already includes it) and to hotel 
and restaurant bills. The VAT is not a hidden expense, but not all quoted 
room rates, especially in the luxury tier, include the tax. Be sure to ask 
whether your quoted room rate includes the VAT. (In the hotel listings in 
Chapter 9, I tell you if the rate doesn’t include the VAT.)

Dining
In recent years, London has emerged as one of the great food capitals of 
the world, known for the variety of its restaurants and the overall qual-
ity of the cooking. The top restaurants will cost you a pretty penny, no 
two ways about it, but you’ll find that many of them are adapting to the 
realities of the current economic climate by offering fixed-price meals 
and lower-cost specials. In addition, countless pubs, local restaurants, 
cafes, and sandwich shops exist where you can dine cheaply and well. 
And if your budget is really tight, you can buy takeout meals at super-
markets for a fraction of what it costs to dine out anywhere in London. 
Overall, because of the favorable exchange rate, you’ll be paying less to 
dine out in London than you would have two years ago.
If you eat lunch and dinner at the moderately priced restaurants that I 
recommend in Chapter 10, expect to pay £25 to £50 ($41–$83) per 
person per day for meals, not including alcoholic drinks (assuming that 
breakfast is included in your hotel rate). If you have breakfast at a cafe 
rather than your hotel and are content with coffee and a roll, expect to 
pay about £5 to £6 ($8.25–$9.90). Depending on the restaurant, an old-
fashioned English breakfast with eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and tea 
or coffee can run anywhere from £7 to £15 ($12–$25). Likewise, a simple 
afternoon tea at a cafe sets you back about £6 to £8 ($9.90–$13), but a 
lavish high tea at one of the great London hotels will run £31 ($51) or 
more. For specifics on restaurants, inexpensive cafes and sandwich 
shops, and places for afternoon tea, see Chapter 10.
 
 On top of the VAT, a few restaurants add a service charge of 12.5 percent 
to 15 percent to your bill. If they do, the menu and the bill have to state 
this policy. This charge amounts to mandatory tipping, so if your credit 
card receipt comes back with a space for you to add a tip, put a line 
through it.
Sightseeing
Your budget for admission fees depends, of course, on what you want to 
see. Some of London’s top attractions are pricey indeed: An adult ticket 
to the Tower of London costs £17 ($28). But many other outstanding 
attractions in London — the British Museum, National Gallery, 
National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain, and Tate Modern — are com-
pletely free. So are the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, 
and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Strolling through London’s great 
parks or viewing Buckingham Palace (okay, from the outside) and the 
Changing of the Guard won’t cost you a penny. From my suggestions in 
Chapter 11, you can weed out the must-see sights from the maybes.
 
 Keep in mind that if you’re a senior or a student, you can often get a 
reduced-price admission, and most attractions offer reduced family rates 
that are good for two adults and two children. Be sure to bring some form 
of photo identification to prove your senior or student status.

 Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 45
Shopping and nightlife
Shopping and entertainment are the most flexible parts of your budget. 
You don’t have to buy anything at all, and you can go for an evening 
stroll instead of seeing a play or dancing at a club. You know what you 
want. Flip through the shopping options in Chapter 12 and the entertain-
ment and nightlife venues in Chapters 15 and 16. If anything strikes you as 
something you can’t do without, budget accordingly. (Keep in mind that 
a pint in a pub sets you back about £3/$4.95, whereas a theater, opera, 
or concert ticket can cost anywhere from £10/$17 to over £50/$83.)
 
 If you’re not a resident of the European Union, you can get a VAT refund 
on purchases made in the United Kingdom. (This refund doesn’t include 
hotels, restaurants, or entertainment.) See Chapter 12 for details.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
 
 Throughout this book, the Bargain Alert icon highlights money-saving tips 
and/or great deals. Check out some additional cost-cutting strategies:
 
✓ Go in the off-season. If you can travel at non-peak times (Oct to 
mid-Dec or Jan–Mar), you’ll find hotel prices can be as much as 20 
percent less than during peak months.
 
✓ Travel on off days of the week. Airfares vary, depending on the 
day of the week. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or 
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to London. See if you can 
get a cheaper rate by flying on a different day.
 
✓ Try a package tour. For popular destinations like London, you can 
make just one call to a travel agent or packager to book airfare, 
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing. You pay 
much less than if you tried to put the trip together yourself (see 
Chapter 5).
 
✓ Reserve a hotel room with a kitchen. In London, these rooms are 
called self-catering units. With your own kitchen, you can do at least 
some of your own cooking. You’ll save money by not eating in res-
taurants two or three times a day. Parents traveling with small chil-
dren may find this strategy particularly useful.
 
✓ Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier 
programs, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for 
discounts on plane tickets, hotel rooms, or even meals.
 
✓ Always ask if any special room rates are in effect. Hotels are 
eager to fill their rooms and now offer many different rates, includ-
ing “promotional” rates and lower weekend rates. In most cases, 
you’ll find these special rates on hotels’ Web sites.
 
✓ Ask if your kids can stay in your room with you. A room with 
two double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
46
queen-size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional-
person rate if that person is pint-size and related to you. Even if 
you have to pay a few pounds extra for a rollaway bed, you save 
hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 
✓ Use pay phones rather than the phone in your hotel room. You 
may find the telephone in your hotel room convenient, but avoid 
using it if you’re on a budget. A local call that costs 40p (65¢) at a 
phone booth may cost you £1 ($1.65) or more from your hotel 
room. If you plan to make a number of calls during your trip, get a 
phone card (see the details about using phones in the Quick 
Concierge, at the end of this book) and use pay phones.
 
✓ Try expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner. At most 
top restaurants, prices at lunch are considerably lower than those 
at dinner, and the menu often includes many of the dinnertime spe-
cialties. Also, look for fixed-price menus.
 
✓ Buy takeout meals at supermarkets and sandwich shops. If you’re 
on a tight budget, skip restaurants and head instead to a nearby 
supermarket or sandwich shop. Supermarkets in London and 
throughout England sell sandwiches and all manner of “take-away” 
meals, so you can create your own picnic.
 
✓ Walk a lot. London is large but completely walkable. A good pair of 
walking shoes can save you money on taxis and other local trans-
portation. As a bonus, you get to know the city and its inhabitants 
more intimately, and you can explore at a slower pace.
 
✓ Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories should 
be the best mementos of your trip. If you’re worried about your 
budget, do without the T-shirts, key chains, and other trinkets.
Ways to save in London and beyond
With a single, one-way fare on the London Underground currently priced at £4 ($6.60), 
you’ll save lots of money by purchasing a one-day or multiday Travelcard or Oyster, 
good for unlimited travel on the Underground and buses. For more information on 
London Travelcards and Oysters, see Chapter 8.
If you plan to travel around England by train, consider getting a BritRail pass. These 
passes offer considerable savings over individual fares, but you must buy them before 
you arrive — they aren’t sold in England. You have many options: a choice of either 
first or standard class, senior passes for those over 60, travel-time periods from 
four consecutive days to one month, and Flexipasses allowing you to travel a certain 
number of days within a set time period. You can also get a London Plus Pass that’s 
great for day trips around London. You can find information on the various rail passes 
in Chapter 14.

 Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 47
Handling Money
Money makes the world go ’round, but dealing with an unfamiliar cur-
rency can make your head spin. In London, you pay for things in pounds 
and pence, meaning you have to convert your own currency into British 
pounds sterling. When it comes to carrying money in London, should 
you bring traveler’s checks or use ATMs? What about paying with credit 
cards? In the following sections, I tell you what you need to know about 
each option.
Making sense of pounds and pence
Britain’s unit of currency is the pound sterling (£). Every pound is 
divided into 100 pence (p). Coins come in denominations of 1p, 2p, 5p, 
10p, 20p, 50p, £1, and £2. Notes are available in £5, £10, £20, and £50 
denominations. As with any unfamiliar currency, British pounds and 
pence take a bit of getting used to. The coins have different sizes, 
shapes, and weights according to value. Each bank-note denomination 
has its own color and bears a likeness of the queen. All currency is 
drawn on the Bank of England.
Exchanging your currency
The exchange rate, which fluctuates every day, is the rate that you get 
when you use your own currency to buy pounds sterling (see Table 4-2). 
In general, $1 = 60p or £1 = $1.65. These are approximate figures, but 
they’re what I use for all prices in this guide (rounded to the nearest 
dollar if the amount is $10 or more, and to the nearest nickel if the 
amount is less than $10). When you’re about to leave on your trip, check 
with your bank or look in the newspaper to find out the current rate.

Changing money (either cash or traveler’s checks) into a foreign cur-
rency makes many people nervous, especially if they’re changing money 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
48
for the first time. You needn’t fear. Changing money is a simple opera-
tion. Just remember that every time you exchange money, you need to 
show your passport. (This is one reason why using a London ATM to 
withdraw money when you arrive is so much easier than exchanging 
cash or traveler’s checks.)
If you want some pounds in hand when you arrive at the airport in 
London, you can exchange currency before you leave home at many 
banks and at foreign-exchange services at international airports. 
Otherwise, you can easily change cash or traveler’s checks in London by 
using a currency-exchange service called a bureau de change. These 
services are available at major London airports, all branches of major 
banks, all major rail and Underground stations in Central London, post 
offices, and American Express or Thomas Cook offices. Unless located 
in a bank or travel agency, most bureaux de change are open daily from 
8 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Every major bank in Central London has a foreign-currency window 
where you can exchange traveler’s checks or cash. Weekday hours for 
banks are generally 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but a few open earlier. Some 
banks (usually based in busy shopping areas) are open all day Saturday. 
All banks are closed on public holidays, but many branches have 24-hour 
banking lobbies with ATMs or ATMs on the street outside. Banks in 
London and throughout the United Kingdom include Barclays Bank 
(% 020/7441-3200; www.barclays.co.uk), HSBC (% 0845-743-4445; 
www.hsbc.com), Midland Bank (% 020/7599-3232; www.midlandnb.
com), and NatWest (% 020/7395-5500; www.natwest.com). These 
banking companies all have branches throughout the city.
Reputable London banks and bureaux de change exchange money at 
a competitive rate but charge a commission (typically 1 percent to 
3 percent of the total transaction) and a small additional fee (usually 
£3/$4.95). Some currency-exchange services now guarantee you the 
same exchange rate when you return pounds for dollars.
 
 All U.K. bureaux de change and other money-changing establishments are 
required to display exchange rates and full details of any fees and rates of 
commission with clarity and equal prominence. Rates must be displayed 
at or near the entrance to the premises. Rates fluctuate from place to 
place, and so do fees, so shopping around sometimes pays.
 
 Steer clear of bureaux de change that offer good exchange rates but charge 
a heavy commission (up to 8 percent). You find them in major tourist sec-
tions of London (some are open 24 hours). Some hotels also cash travel-
er’s checks, but their commission is often considerably higher than at a 
bank or bureau de change. Before exchanging your money, always check 
to see the exchange rate, how much commission you’ll have to pay, and 
whether additional fees apply.

 Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 49
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM. 
You’ll find ATMs, or cashpoints as they’re sometimes called in England, 
all over London. The Cirrus (% 800/424-7787; www.mastercard.com) 
and PLUS (% 800/843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe; 
look on the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, and 
then call or check online for ATM locations in London. Be sure that you 
know your personal identification number (PIN) before you leave home, 
and find out your daily withdrawal limit before you depart. Some banks 
will allow you to withdraw cash only from your checking account, not 
from your savings.
Also, keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time you use 
your card at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee may cost more for 
international transactions (up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones 
(where it rarely goes over $1.50). On top of this fee from your bank, the 
bank from which you withdraw cash may charge its own fee. For interna-
tional withdrawal fees, ask your bank.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to access money. They also provide a conve-
nient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively 
good exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your 
credit cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve 
forgotten yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on 
the back of your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually 
takes five to seven business days to arrive by mail, though some banks 
will provide the number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s 
maiden name or some other personal information.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, most banks 
assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee that Visa, MasterCard, 
and American Express charge for currency conversion on credit 
charges. But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you 
factor in things like ATM fees and higher traveler’s check exchange rates 
(and service fees).
 
 Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any 
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when you 
use the card numerous times in a foreign destination and block your 
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, 
you can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is 
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with 
you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so 
having a backup is the smart way to go.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
50
In the past, some travelers reported difficulties using their credit cards in 
London and throughout England. They were told that their credit cards 
couldn’t be “swiped” through the point-of-sale device and that they had to 
have a PIN to use the card. Today, most London and U.K. businesses have 
adapted to this problem and are equipped to handle U.S. credit cards.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary than they were in the 
past, because most cities, including London, have 24-hour ATMs that allow 
you to withdraw cash as needed, with less hassle and with comparable or 
even cheaper service charges. You can get traveler’s checks at almost any 
bank. American Express offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and 
(for cardholders only) $1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 
percent to 4 percent. You can also get American Express traveler’s checks 
over the phone by calling % 800/221-7282; Amex gold and platinum card-
holders who use this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as 
at several other banks. The service charge ranges from 1.5 percent to 
2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and 
$1,000. Call % 800/732-1322 or go to www.visa.com for information. 
AAA members can obtain Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices 
by calling % 866/339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. 
Call % 800/223-9920 for a location near you.
 
 If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their 
serial numbers separate from your checks. If the checks are lost or stolen, 
you’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
 
 Never pay for hotels, meals, or purchases with traveler’s checks denomi-
nated in any currency other than British pounds. You get a bad exchange 
rate if you try to use them as cash.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report with the 
police. In London, call % 192 for directory assistance, free from public 
pay phones, to find out the precinct nearest you. Your credit card com-
pany or insurer may require a police report number or record of the 
loss. Most credit card companies have an emergency toll-free number to 
call if your card is lost or stolen; the company may be able to wire you a 
cash advance immediately or deliver an emergency credit card in a day 
or two. Call the following emergency numbers in the United Kingdom:
 
✓ American Express: % 01273/696-933
 
✓ MasterCard: % 01702/362-988
 
✓ Visa: % 01604/230-230

 Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 51
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when all banks and 
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you 
via Western Union (% 0800/833-833; www.westernunion.co.uk).
 
 If you follow four basic rules, you can minimize the risk of a crime happen-
ing to you:
 
✓ Don’t keep your wallet in your back pocket or in your backpack, 
but do keep it out of sight.
 
✓ Don’t leave your purse, briefcase, backpack, or coat unattended in 
any public place. This isn’t only to protect you from thieves. In 
London, with its stepped-up security, unattended items can be con-
fiscated by the police.
 
✓ Ladies, don’t hang your purse over the back of your chair in 
crowded or outdoor cafes or restaurants.
 
✓ Don’t flash your money or credit cards around.
Earning their keep: Royal expenses
There was a flurry of controversy (pronounced con-traw-ver-sy) in 2006 when 
Buckingham Palace’s accounts revealed that the overall cost to taxpayers of keeping 
the monarchy rose 4.7 percent to £37.4 million ($74.8 million, at the time), or about 62p 
($1.25) per U.K. resident. Travel expenses accounted for a significant part of the rise. 
One trip to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and India by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of 
Cornwall, cost £304,000 ($608,000). British taxpayers paid £400,000 ($800,000) for wine 
and spirits for the queen’s cellars, while £300,000 ($600,000) was spent on a new kitchen 
for Windsor Castle. The cost of new security measures at Buckingham Palace came to 
about £150,000 ($300,000). Utilities for the royal properties totaled £2 million ($4 million), 
with about £1 million ($2 million) spent on catering and hospitality, including £600,000 
($1,200,000) for garden parties.
In 2009, a new royal expense scandal reared its royal head when it was learned that 
state subsidies for the Prince of Wales had jumped from £2.45 million ($4.04 million) to 
£3.03 million ($5 million), and his private income had increased to £16.4 million ($27.1 
million), but he’d still managed to cut his tax bill by 10 percent. There was no official 
figure for the estimated £2 million ($3.3 million) it costs to pay for Charles and Camilla’s 
security. For some, the get-more-pay-less news wasn’t surprising, but it came at a time 
when the British public was still furious over the MP (Members of Parliament) expense 
scandals that rocked the United Kingdom in 2009 (p. 22), and at a time when the govern-
ment, in the midst of a recession, was making cuts to public services. Clarence House, 
the prince’s official residence, said that annual accounts showed that the increase in 
the public cost of Prince Charles was due to a “busier than ever year for Prince Charles 
and the Duchess of Cornwall.” True, the royal twosome has not slouched. Records 
showed that Charlie and Camilla had undertaken 658 joint and solo official engagements, 
hosted more than 9,000 people at events at royal residences, and traveled more than 
50,000 miles at home and abroad in the course of their work on behalf of the country.

N
ow that you’ve decided to visit London, you need to find a way to 
get there. In this chapter, I discuss your options for direct, non-
stop flights and give you some ideas on how you can save money on 
your flight (and your hotel). I’ve also got all the information on reaching 
the United Kingdom via train and ferry, for those travelers who arrive 
from Europe. What are the pros and cons of taking an escorted tour? 
You can find answers to your basic travel questions in this chapter.
Flying to London
London’s airports are among the busiest in the world, with direct or con-
necting flights from all over the globe. Finding a flight won’t be difficult, 
but choosing one from the many that are offered may require some 
research and comparison shopping for the lowest fare.
Finding out which airlines fly to London
Most regularly scheduled international flights from the United States, 
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand arrive at London’s Heathrow and 
Gatwick airports. Flights from the Continent land at Heathrow, Gatwick, 
Stansted, or London City. London Luton, the smallest of London’s five 
airports, is a destination for charter flights from the Continent.
Here’s a brief description of each of the London airports and who flies to 
them (see the Quick Concierge, at the end of this book, for the contact 
information of the airlines in this list):
 
✓ Heathrow, the main international airport, is 24km (15 miles) west 
of Central London. It’s served by Air Canada (Canadian flights from 
Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa, St. John’s, Toronto, and Vancouver); Air 

 Chapter 5: Getting to London 53
New Zealand (Australian flights from Sydney; New Zealand flights 
from Auckland); American (U.S. flights from Boston, Chicago, Los 
Angeles, Miami, and New York JFK); British Airways (U.S. flights 
from Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New 
York JFK, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington 
Dulles; Australian flights from Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and 
Sydney; New Zealand flights from Auckland); Continental (U.S. 
flights from Los Angeles, Newark, New York JFK, San Francisco, and 
Washington Dulles); Icelandair (U.S. flights from Baltimore, Boston, 
Minneapolis/St. Paul, and New York JFK); Qantas (Australian flights 
from Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney; New Zealand flights from 
Auckland); United (U.S. flights from Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, 
Newark, New York JFK, San Francisco, and Washington Dulles); and 
Virgin Atlantic (U.S. flights from Chicago, Newark, New York JFK, 
San Francisco, and Washington Dulles). For information on getting 
into London from Heathrow, see Chapter 8.
 
✓ Gatwick is a smaller airport about 40km (25 miles) south of London. 
It’s served by American (U.S. flights from Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, 
and Raleigh/Durham); British Airways (U.S. flights from Atlanta, 
Baltimore, Charlotte, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Denver, Houston, Miami, 
New York JFK, Orlando, Phoenix, and Tampa); Continental (U.S. 
flights from Boston, Cleveland, Houston, Miami, Newark, and 
Orlando); Delta (U.S. flights from Atlanta and Cincinnati); Northwest 
(U.S. flights from Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul); Qantas 
(Australian flights from Sydney); and Virgin Atlantic (U.S. flights 
from Boston, Las Vegas, Miami, Newark, Orlando, and San Francisco). 
For information on getting into London from Gatwick, see Chapter 8.
 
✓ Stansted, 80km (50 miles) northeast of London, handles national 
and European flights. See Chapter 8 for information on getting into 
London from Stansted.
 
✓ London City, only 10km (6 miles) east of Central London, services 
European destinations. You can find information on getting into 
London from this airport in Chapter 8.
 
✓ London Luton, 45km (28 miles) northwest of London, services 
mostly charter flights. Chapter 8 provides information on getting 
into Central London from London Luton.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other 
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a 
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of 
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last 
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who 
want to get home before the weekend — pay the premium rate, known 
as the full fare.

 If you can book your ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and 
travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least expen-
sive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. Obviously, planning ahead 
and being flexible with your travel dates pays off.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices 
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase require-
ments and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As you 
plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend to 
take place in seasons of low travel volume — in England, that’s basically 
October through March. You almost never see a sale around the peak 
summer vacation months of July and August, or around Thanksgiving or 
Christmas, when many people fly, regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Search the Internet for cheap fares. The most popular online travel 
agencies are Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), 
and Travelocity (www.travelocity.com). In the United Kingdom, go 
to Travelsupermarket (% 0845/345-5708; www.travelsupermarket.
com), a flight search engine that offers flight comparisons for the budget 
airlines whose seats often end up in bucket-shop sales. Other Web sites 
for booking airline tickets online include Cheapflights.com, Smarter 
Travel (www.smartertravel.com), Priceline.com, and Opodo (www.
opodo.com). Meta search sites (which find and then direct you to air-
line and hotel Web sites for booking) include SideStep (www.sidestep.
com) and Kayak (www.kayak.com); the latter includes fares for budget 
carriers like JetBlue and Spirit, as well as the major airlines. As its name 
indicates, lastminute.com is a great source for last-minute flights and 
getaways. In addition, most airlines offer online-only fares that even 
their phone agents know nothing about.
Watch local newspapers for promotional specials or fare wars, when 
airlines lower prices on their most popular routes. Also keep an eye on 
price fluctuations and deals at Web sites such as Airfarewatchdog.com 
and Bing (www.bing.com/travel).
Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but membership may 
entitle you to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and 
prompter service if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or 
delayed, or if you want to change your seat (especially after you’ve 
racked up some miles). And you don’t have to fly to earn points; 
frequent-flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing 
your everyday shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs 
on the market, consumers have never had more options. Investigate the 
program details of your favorite airlines before you sink points into any 
one. Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and, 
of those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances, given 
your most common routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your best 
advantage, consult the community bulletin boards on FlyerTalk 
(www.flyertalk.com) or go to Randy Petersen’s InsideFlyer (www.
insideflyer.com). Petersen and friends review all the programs in 
detail and post regular updates on changes in policies and trends.

 Chapter 5: Getting to London 55
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for interna-
tional tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares 
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, the Los Angeles 
Times, and the Miami Herald.
 
 Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket 
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety 
records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available online, and 
most of them offer flights to London. STA Travel (% 800/781-4040; 
www.statravel.com), the world’s leader in student travel, offers good 
fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress (% 800/872-8800; www.
flights.com) started in Europe and has excellent fares worldwide. 
Flights.com also has “local” Web sites in 12 countries. 
 
 Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services 
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on 
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only valid 
for travel that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months in 
advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline Web sites or check 
mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials, such 
as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com). For last-minute trips, 
lastminute.com often has better deals than the major-label sites.
Arriving by Other Means
If you’re traveling to London from another destination in Europe, you 
don’t have to fly to get there. Train and car ferries and high-speed hover-
crafts cross the English Channel throughout the year from ports in France, 
Holland, and Belgium. And the Eurostar high-speed train zips beneath 
the channel through the Chunnel, a tunnel beneath the English Channel.
Taking the train
London has several train stations, and the one you arrive at depends on 
your point of departure from the Continent. The three-hour Eurostar 
service connecting Paris and Brussels to London via the Chunnel arrives 
at King’s Cross/St. Pancras International Station. Trains from Amsterdam 
arrive at Liverpool Street Station. Other London train stations include 
Euston, Paddington, Victoria, and Waterloo stations.
 
 Several types of Eurostar fares are available. Senior fares for those ages 
60 and over and youth fares for those 25 and younger can cut the price of 
a first-class fare by 20 percent or more. The same reductions apply for 
passengers traveling with validated Eurail and BritRail passes. To check 
out current and special promotional fares for Eurostar, visit Rail Europe’s 
Web site at www.raileurope.com.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
56
 
 The trains in England and the rest of the United Kingdom are separate 
from those in continental Europe, so a Eurail pass isn’t valid in the U.K. If 
you’re going to travel within England or the rest of the United Kingdom, 
check out the various BritRail passes available (see Chapter 14 for more 
information).
For more information on train schedules, routes, and fares throughout 
England, go to www.nationalrail.co.uk or call % 084/5748-4950.
Riding a ferry or hovercraft
Crossing times for the car, train, and passenger ferries that regularly 
crisscross the English Channel can be anywhere from 90 minutes to 5 
hours, depending on the point of departure. Various hovercrafts (high-
speed ferries with propellers that lift them off the surface of the water) 
skim over the water in as little as half an hour. Frequent train service to 
London is available from all the channel ports.
Here’s a list of the major ferry and hovercraft companies:
 
✓ Norfolk Line (% 0870/870-1020; www.norfolkline-ferries.
com) accepts motorists on its ferries between Dover, England, and 
Dunkerque, France (13⁄4 hours).
 
✓ P&O Ferries (% 0870/598-0333; www.poferries.com) offers 
daily ferry/car crossings between Cherbourg and Portsmouth (5 
hours) and Le Havre and Portsmouth (51⁄2 hours) and between 
Calais and Dover (11⁄4 hours).
 
✓ Sea France Limited (% 0871/663-2546; www.seafrance.com) 
runs ferries between Dover and Calais (11⁄2 hours).
Joining an Escorted Tour
Some people love escorted tours. The tour company takes care of all the 
details and tells you what to expect at each leg of your journey. You 
know your costs upfront and don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours 
can take you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount 
of time with the least amount of hassle.
 
 If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay 
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour opera-
tor doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid 
for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obligations 
either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (You can find 
out more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you 
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few 
simple questions before you buy:

 Chapter 5: Getting to London 57
 
✓ What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel the 
trip if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if 
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the tour 
operator cancels?
 
✓ How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit 
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax 
or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not returning to your 
hotel until 7 or 8 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain escorted tours 
may not be for you.
 
✓ How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you 
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators 
may be evasive about this, because the exact size of the group may 
be up in the air until everybody has made reservations, but the 
company should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 
✓ Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum 
group size, and the tour operator may cancel the tour if it doesn’t 
book enough people. If a quota exists, find out what that quota is 
and how close the operator is to reaching it. Again, tour operators 
may be evasive, but the information may help you select a tour 
that’s sure to happen.
 
✓ What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have 
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be 
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be 
included, but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you 
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with 
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you 
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same 
chicken cutlet?
Here are two companies that offer escorted tours to London and the rest 
of England (with prices per person, based on double occupancy):
 
✓ Globus and Cosmos (www.globusandcosmos.com) are well-
known budget tour companies working in partnership. Current 
offerings include England-wide tours, with stays in London; the 
selection of tours changes yearly and sometimes includes four-day/
three-night tours of London.
 
✓ Trafalgar Tours (www.trafalgartours.com) provides tours to 
London and the rest of the United Kingdom. Prices for the London 
Week tour start at $999, not including airfare. The company also 
offers an eight-day London, Stratford & Bath tour, starting at 
$1,075, not including airfare.
Choosing a package tour
For many destinations, including London, package tours can be a smart 
way to go. In many cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and 
transportation to and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
58
a vacation that you book yourself. That’s because packages are sold in 
bulk to tour operators, who resell them to the public.
Package tours vary greatly in what they provide. Some offer a better 
class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for lower 
prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters. In 
some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days may be 
limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and indepen-
dent vacations; others allow you to add on a few excursions or escorted 
day trips (also at discounted prices).
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday 
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines, such as 
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler. 
Liberty Travel (% 888/271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one of 
the biggest packagers in the northeastern United States and usually 
boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. 
Most major airlines offer air/land packages. Several big online travel 
agencies — Expedia, lastminute.com, Orbitz, and Travelocity — also do 
a brisk business in packages.
Locating package tours
Information about package tours is available from a variety of sources. 
Here are a few companies that offer packages to England:
 
✓ British Travel International (% 727/653-5710; www.british
travel.com) is a good source for discount packages.
 
✓ Liberty Travel (% 888/271-1584; www.libertytravel.com), one 
of the biggest packagers in the northeastern United States, offers 
reasonably priced packages.
 
✓ Trailfinders (www.trailfinders.com), another good source 
for discount packages, has several offices in Australia: Brisbane 
(% 07/3229-0887), Cairns (% 07/4041-1199), Melbourne (% 03/
9600-3022), Perth (% 08/9226-1222), and Sydney (% 02/9247-
7666).
Checking out airline and hotel packages
Airlines are good sources for package tours because they package their 
flights together with accommodations. The following airlines offer pack-
ages to London:
 
✓ American Airlines Vacations (% 800/321-2121; www.
aavacations.com)
 
✓ British Airways Holidays (% 800/247-9297; www.
baholidays.com)

 Chapter 5: Getting to London 59
 
✓ Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800/525-0280; www.

✓ Delta Vacations (% 800/800-1504; www.deltavacations.com)
 
✓ United Airlines Vacations (% 800/328-6877; www.united

Catering to Special 
Needs or Interests
In This Chapter
▶ Visiting London with children
▶ Getting discounts and special tours for seniors
▶ Locating wheelchair-accessible attractions
▶ Finding lesbian- and gay-friendly communities and special events
M
any of today’s travelers have special needs or interests. Parents 
may want to take their children along on trips. Seniors may be 
looking for special discounts or tours designed especially for them. 
People with disabilities want to ensure that sites on their itineraries 
offer wheelchair access. And gays and lesbians may want to know about 
welcoming places and events. In response to these needs, this chapter 
offers advice and resources.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Traveling with children, from toddlers to teens, is a challenge — no 
doubt about it. Bringing the brood can put a strain on the budget and 
influence your choices of activities, restaurants, and hotels. But in the 
end, isn’t sharing your experiences as a family great?
 Look for the Kid Friendly icon as you flip through this book. I use it to 
highlight hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are particularly family 
friendly. Zeroing in on these places can help you plan your trip quicker 
and easier.
In addition, the following resources can help you plan your trip:
 
✓ About Family Travel (% 541/778-2022; www.about-family-
travel.com) can tailor a tour specifically for families traveling to 
London. Its services include arranging airfares, hotel rooms, trans-
portation, and theater tickets, as well as providing tips on sights 
and destinations. Don’t rely on its free online London information, 
however, because it hasn’t been updated in years.

 Chapter 6: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 61
 
✓ Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com) is a com-
prehensive site that offers customized trip planning.
 
✓ Kids Love London (http://kids.visitlondon.com), by the 
London Tourist Board, is a site created to give kids the lowdown on 
kid-friendly attractions, events, restaurants, and more.
 
✓ TravelWithYourKids.com (www.travelwithyourkids.com) is 
another comprehensive site full of sound advice for long-distance 
and international travel with children.
 
 Admission prices for most London attractions are generally reduced for 
children 5 to 16 years old. Children 4 and under almost always get in for 
free. If you’re traveling with one or two children, always check to see 
whether the attraction offers a money-saving family ticket, which consid-
erably reduces the admission price for a group of two adults and two or 
three children.
Locating family-friendly accommodations 
and restaurants
Most hotels will happily accommodate your family if you reserve your 
rooms in advance and make the staff aware that you’re traveling with 
kids. The establishment may bring in an extra cot or let you share a 
larger room; these types of arrangements are common. Smaller bed-and-
breakfasts (B&Bs) may present problems, such as cramped rooms and 
shared toilet facilities, and some places don’t accept children at all. Ask 
questions before you reserve.
 
 To keep costs down, you can rent a hotel room with a kitchen (in England 
these rooms are called self-catering units) and prepare your own meals. 
Another option, when the weather cooperates, is to take the family on a 
picnic. Kensington Gardens or Hyde Park may be just the ticket for an 
enjoyable afternoon (see Chapter 10 for more suggestions). You can also 
take advantage of pre-theater, fixed-price menus (usually 5:30–7 p.m.), 
which often give you a good deal.
London has plenty of American-style fast food places, including Burger 
King, KFC, McDonald’s, and Pizza Hut. Teens may want to check out 
the Hard Rock Cafe in Mayfair or the scene at the Pepsi Trocadero in 
Piccadilly Circus, which offers theme restaurants such as Planet 
Hollywood and the Rainforest Cafe (see Chapter 10). London is also a 
good place to introduce more adventurous kids to Chinese or Indian cui-
sine, or to the communal dining experience offered by Wagamama 
Japanese noodle restaurants.
 
 Expensive restaurants are sometimes less welcoming toward young chil-
dren. The menus aren’t geared to the tastes of youngsters, the prices can 
be high, and the staff may be less than accommodating. Call before you go 
and ask if the restaurant has special children’s menus or can provide ame-
nities such as highchairs or booster seats.

62
Planning your trip together
Letting your younger children read Peter Pan or Peter Pan in Kensington 
Gardens, and telling them about his statue there, can generate excite-
ment about the trip. Slightly older children may want to read the Harry 
Potter series, which takes place in real and fictional settings in London 
and around the country. (If your kids have already read the Harry Potter 
series, they know that Harry lives just south of London — in fact, he 
leaves from King’s Cross Station to go off to Hogwarts.) With the infor-
mation in this book and some online investigating, you can also excite 
your kids’ curiosity about historic sites such as the Tower of London 
and the Prime Meridian line at Greenwich. And most young people 
enjoy the prospect of a meal at the Hard Rock Cafe or a trip to Madame 
Tussauds wax museum.
Some kid and adult activities can easily overlap. You may want to spend 
one afternoon in Kensington Gardens. After the entire family visits 
Kensington Palace, the kids can blow off steam in the adjacent Princess 
Diana Memorial Playground. Many kid-oriented activities in London are 
just as interesting for parents. From the fantastic dinosaur exhibit in the 
Natural History Museum to the animatronic robots re-creating historic 
scenes at Madame Tussauds, you and your kids have plenty to experi-
ence and enjoy together.
Preparing for a long trip
 
 The shortest trip from the United States to London (from New York) is 
about 6 hours; airtime from Australia may be 25 hours, which is a lot of 
time for kids to sit still and be quiet. Although children can spend some of 
the journey time watching a movie (or two) on the plane, come prepared 
with extra diversions: games, puzzles, books — whatever you know will 
keep your kids entertained. If your child needs baby food, bring your own 
and ask a flight attendant to warm it. Dealing with jet lag can be hard on 
adults but even harder on small children. Don’t schedule too much for 
your first day in London. Get everyone comfortably settled, and then take 
it from there.
Hiring a baby sitter while on your trip
What you really need is a relaxing evening at the opera and a romantic 
late dinner. But you can’t take Junior along. What are your options? Ask 
your hotel staff if they can recommend a local babysitting service. Most 
of the hotels marked with a Kid Friendly icon in Chapter 9 can arrange 
for babysitting. London also has several respected and trustworthy baby-
sitting agencies that provide registered nurses and carefully screened 
mothers, as well as trained nannies, to watch children. One old and 
trustworthy babysitting service is Universal Aunts (% 020/7386-8937; 
www.universalaunts.co.uk), which charges £12 ($20) per daytime 

 Chapter 6: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 63
hour (£14/$23 Sat–Sun), £9 ($15) per hour from 6 p.m. to midnight 
(3-hour minimum), plus a £19 ($31) agency fee and cab fare home for 
the sitter.
A fully licensed 24-hour child-care facility, Pippa Pop-ins, 430 Fulham 
Rd., SW6 1DU (% 020/7731-1445; www.pippapopins.com), in Chelsea, 
provides a lovely toy-filled nursery, staffed by experienced caregivers, 
where you can safely park the little ones. Call for rates. Another branch 
is located in Fulham, at 165 New Kings Rd., SW6 (same phone number 
and Web address).
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
London won’t present any problems for you if you’re a senior who gets 
around easily. If you do have mobility issues, be aware when you plan 
your trip that not all hotels — particularly less expensive B&Bs — have 
elevators. The steep staircases in some places are a test for anyone with 
luggage. When you reserve a hotel, ask whether you’ll have access to a 
elevator (a lift in Britspeak).
 
 In most cities, including London, being a senior often entitles you to some 
terrific travel bargains, such as reduced admissions at theaters, museums, 
and other attractions. Carrying ID with proof of age can pay off in all these 
situations. Note: In London and throughout the United Kingdom, you may 
find that some senior discounts are available only to U.K. residents. But 
always ask, even if the reduction isn’t posted.
The following sources can provide information on discounts and other 
benefits for seniors.
 
✓ AARP (% 800/424-3410; www.aarp.org) offers member dis-
counts on car rentals and hotels. AARP offers $13 yearly member-
ships that include discounts on flights to London, when booked 
through the AARP Web site.
 
✓ Elderhostel (% 877/426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) offers per-
sons 55 and older a variety of university-based educational programs 
in London and throughout England. These courses are value-packed, 
hassle-free ways to learn while traveling. The price includes airfare, 
accommodations, meals, tuition, tips, and insurance. And you’ll be 
glad to know that you don’t receive any grades. Popular London offer-
ings have included “Inside the Parliament,” “Legal London,” “Classical 
Music and Opera in London,” and “Treasures of London Galleries.”
 
✓ Grand Circle/Overseas Adventure Travel (% 800/959-0405; www.
gct.com) is another agency that offers mature travelers tours to 
England.

Accessing London: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
More options and resources are available for disabled travelers than ever 
before. In London, most hotels and restaurants happily accommodate 
people with disabilities. London’s top sights are wheelchair accessible. 
Theaters and performing-arts venues are wheelchair accessible as well 
(always call first to make arrangements and get directions to special 
entrances and elevators), and so are most London buses.
 
 People with disabilities are often entitled to special discounts at sightsee-
ing and entertainment venues in Britain. These discounts are called con-
cessions (often shortened to concs).
 
 Before departing on your trip, check out the VisitBritain Web site (www.
visitbritain.com) for helpful general information. Access in London is 
the best and most comprehensive London guide for people with disabili-
ties or anyone with a mobility problem. The book provides full access 
information for all the major sites, hotels, and modes of transportation. 
You can order it at www.accessinlondon.org or from major online 
booksellers.
The United Kingdom has several information resources for disabled 
travelers. The best of these resources are the following:
 
✓ Artsline (% 020/7388-2227; www.artsline.org.uk) provides 
advice on the accessibility of London arts and entertainment events.
 
✓ Holiday Care/Tourism for All Holidays Ltd. (% 0845/124-9971 in 
the U.K. or 020/8760-0072 outside the U.K.; www.holidaycare.
org.uk) offers information and advice on suitable accommoda-
tions, transportation, and other facilities in England.
 
✓ The National Trust (% 020/7447-6742; www.nationaltrust.org.
uk) is a British organization that owns and operates hundreds of his-
toric properties (castles, gardens, and more) throughout England. 
For details on accessibility at each site, download the National Trust 
Access Guide from its Web site. Although not all National Trust sites 
are accessible, the organization provides powered four-wheeled 
vehicles free of charge at more than 50 properties; you can drive 
yourself or have a companion or volunteer drive for you.
 
✓ Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR; 
% 020/7250-3222; www.radar.org.uk) publishes information 
for disabled travelers in Britain.
 
✓ The Society of London Theatres (www.officiallondon
theatre.co.uk) offers a free guide called Access Guide to 
London’s West End Theatres.

 Chapter 6: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 65
Some other helpful resources in the United States include the following:
 
✓ American Foundation for the Blind (% 800/232-5463; www.afb.
org) offers information on traveling with Seeing Eye dogs; the foun-
dation also issues ID cards to the legally blind.
 
✓ The Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality (SATH; % 212/
447-7284; www.sath.org) is a membership organization with 
names and addresses of tour operators specializing in travel for the 
disabled. You can call to subscribe to its magazine, Open World.
 
✓ Travel Information Service (www.mossresourcenet.org) pro-
vides general information and resources for the disabled traveler.
Joining escorted tours
You can find tours designed to meet the needs of travelers with disabili-
ties. One of the best operators is Flying Wheels Travel (% 507/451-
5005; www.flyingwheelstravel.com), which offers various escorted 
tours and cruises, as well as private tours in minivans with lifts.
Here are some other tour operators for London-bound travelers with 
disabilities:
 
✓ Accessible Journeys (% 800/846-4537; www.disability
travel.com) offers tours of Britain and London in minibuses or 
motor coaches.
 
✓ The Guided Tour (% 800/783-5841; e-mail: gtour400@aol.com) 
has one- and two-week guided tours for individuals, with one staff 
member for every three travelers.
 
✓ Undiscovered Britain (% 215/969-0542; www.undiscovered
britain.com) provides specialty travel and tours for individuals, 
small groups, or families traveling with a wheelchair user.
Dealing with access issues
In October 2004, Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act, which 
requires anyone offering a service to remove physical barriers that pre-
vent disabled people from accessing that service, went into effect 
throughout the United Kingdom. What this means is that more and more 
businesses have become accessible, and access in general is easier than 
ever before. Don’t assume, however, that all hotels and restaurants in 
London provide wheelchair ramps. Most of the less-expensive B&Bs and 
older hotels don’t have elevators, or the elevators are too small for a 
wheelchair. Ask about this when you reserve your room or table.
All the top sights and many of the attractions in Chapter 11 are wheel-
chair accessible, but in some cases you must use a different entrance. 
Call the attraction to find out about special entrances, ramps, elevator

locations, and general directions. Major theaters and performing-arts 
venues are often wheelchair accessible as well (again, call first).
Trains throughout the United Kingdom now have wide doors, grab rails, 
and provisions for wheelchairs. The National Rail Web site (www.
nationalrail.co.uk) has a section on disabled travel, and contact 
information for the various train-operating companies.
 
 Disabled travelers will want to keep the following in mind when traveling 
around London:
 
✓ Although London’s streets and sidewalks are generally kept in good 
repair, the city is old and not all streets have modern curb cuts.
 
✓ Not all the city’s Underground (subway) stations have elevators 
and ramps.
 
✓ Low-floor wheelchair-accessible buses serve most stations in 
London.
 
✓ The city’s black cabs are roomy enough for wheelchairs.
 
✓ Victoria Coach Station in Central London has Braille maps.
The following organizations provide access information and services for 
disabled travelers in London:
 
✓ Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk) 
helps travelers with disabilities plan a journey on public transpor-
tation that avoids stairs and escalators. Visit the Web site for more 
information on public transportation accessibility.
 
✓ Wheelchair Travel (% 1483/233-640 in the U.K., 1483/237-668 out-
side the U.K.; www.wheelchair-travel.co.uk) is an indepen-
dent transport service for the disabled traveler arriving in London. 
The organization offers self-drive cars and minibuses (although 
I strongly discourage anyone, disabled or not, from driving in 
London) and can provide wheelchairs. Drivers who also act 
as guides are also available on request. Bring your own disabled 
stickers and permits from home, if you’re going to rent a self-drive 
vehicle.
Taking health precautions
Before you leave on your trip, talk to your physician about your general 
physical condition and your prescriptions for the time you’re traveling, 
the medical equipment that you need to take, and how to get medical 
assistance when you’re away. Carry all prescription medicines in their 
original bottles, with the contents clearly marked, along with a letter 
from your doctor.

 Chapter 6: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 67
 
 Make a list of the generic names of your prescription drugs, in case you 
need to replace or refill them during your visit. Pack medications in your 
hand luggage. If you use a wheelchair, have a maintenance check before 
your trip.
Following the Rainbow: Gay and 
Lesbian Travelers
London has always been a popular destination for gays and lesbians, 
even in the days (prior to 1967) when homosexuality was a criminal 
offense in Britain. Today, with a more tolerant government at the helm 
and civil partnerships offering same-sex couples the same rights as het-
erosexual couples, gay pride is prominent. The city government actually 
spends money to promote gay tourism. You can find gay theaters, gay 
shops, more than 100 gay pubs, famous gay discos, and gay community 
groups of all sorts. The official Visit London Web site (www.visit
london.com) has information on gay venues and events in London.
Old Compton Street, in Soho, is the heart of London’s Gay Village, filled 
with dozens of gay pubs, restaurants, and upscale bars/cafes. The Earl’s 
Court area, long a gay bastion, is home to many gay pubs and 
restaurants.
Lesbigay events in London include the London Lesbian and Gay Film 
Festival in March, the Pride Parade and celebrations in June, and the 
big outdoor bash known as Summer Rites in August. You can obtain 
information and exact dates from the London Lesbian and Gay 
Switchboard at % 020/7837-7324, or online at www.llgs.org.uk.
 
 Brighton (see Chapter 14) is one of the gayest seaside resort towns 
in Europe. From London, you can get to Brighton on the train in under 
an hour.
You may want to check out the following Web sites as you plan your 
trip. All are specifically geared to gay and lesbian travelers to London 
and the United Kingdom:
 
✓ Gay Britain Network: www.gaybritain.co.uk
 
✓ Gay London: www.gaylondon.co.uk
 
✓ Pink Passport: www.pinkpassport.co.uk
 
✓ UK Gay Guide: www.gayguide.co.uk
In addition, several gay magazines, useful for their listings and news 
coverage, are available in gay pubs, clubs, bars, and cafes. The most

popular are Boyz (www.boyz.co.uk), Pink Paper (www.pinkpaper.
com), and QX (Queer Xtra; www.qxmagazine.com). Gay Times (www.
gaytimes.co.uk), a high-quality, monthly, news-oriented mag, is avail-
able at most news agents. Indispensable for its citywide listings (includ-
ing gay listings), Time Out (www.timeout.com), with gay and lesbian 
listings, appears at newsstands on Wednesdays.
Gay’s the Word, 66 Marchmont St., WC1 (% 020/7278-7654; www.gays
theword.co.uk; Tube: Russell Square), the city’s only all-around gay 
and lesbian bookstore, was still open as of press time — but it was 
“under threat” and in danger of closing. The store stocks a fine selection 
of new and used books and current periodicals.

B
efore you depart for London to take that boat ride on the River 
Thames or visit the Tower of London, you need to take care of 
some final details. Do you have an up-to-date passport? Have you taken 
steps to meet your health needs while you’re on your trip? Are you won-
dering how to use a cellphone or access e-mail while in London? Do you 
think you need to rent a car? This chapter gives you the information you 
need to answer those lingering questions.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around 
the world. You can’t cross an international border without one. Getting a 
passport is easy, but the process takes some time.
 
 The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs maintains 
http://travel.state.gov, a Web site that provides everything you 
ever wanted to know about passports (including a downloadable applica-
tion), Customs, and other government-regulated aspects of travel.
Applying for a U.S. passport
 
 If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps.
 
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport 
office; a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
70
 
 To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. Depart-
ment of State passport Web site (http://travel.state.gov) or 
call the National Passport Information Center (% 877/487-2778) 
for automated information.
 
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
 
 Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or Social 
Security card is also a good idea. If you’re a naturalized citizen of 
the United States, you’ll have to provide your Naturalization 
Certificate or Certificate of Citizenship as proof.
 
3. Submit two identical passport-size photos, measuring 2 x 2 inches 
in size.
 
 You often find businesses that take these photos near a passport 
office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo vending machine 
because the pictures aren’t identical. You may submit digital 
photos that have been printed on your printer at home, but they 
must meet the same requirements for all passport photographs. In 
addition, the digital photographs must have a continuous-tone 
image that looks very photolike; grainy-looking photos composed 
of visible dots are not acceptable.
 
4. Pay a fee.
 
 For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years and costs 
$100. For children 15 and under, a passport is valid for five years 
and costs $85.
 
 Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; standard 
processing normally takes three weeks, but it can take longer during busy 
periods (especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the 
past 15 years (and you were over age 15 when it was issued), you can 
renew the passport by mail for $75. Whether you’re applying in person 
or by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. State 
Department passport Web site at http://travel.state.gov.
American Passport Express (% 800/455-5166; www.american
passport.com) is a service that can expedite the processing of your 
first-time passport application. Using this service, and paying the appro-
priate fees, you can receive your passport in as little as 24 hours.
Entering England with your passport
 
 If you’re a citizen of the United States, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, 
you must have a passport with at least six months remaining until its 
expiration to enter the United Kingdom. You need to show your passport 
at the Customs and immigration area when you arrive at a U.K. airport. 

 Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 71
After your passport is stamped, you can remain in the United Kingdom as 
a tourist for up to three months. No visa is required if you’re going to stay 
in England or the rest of the United Kingdom for less than three months.
Dealing with a (gulp!) lost passport
Don’t worry — if you lose your passport in England, you won’t be sent to 
the Tower of London, but you need to take steps to replace it immedi-
ately. First, notify the police. Then go to your consulate or high commis-
sion office (they’re all located in London — you’ll find addresses and 
phone numbers in the Quick Concierge, at the end of this book). Bring 
all available forms of identification, and the staff can get started on gen-
erating your new passport. Always call first to verify the hours.
 
 Before leaving on your trip, make a couple of photocopies of your pass-
port photo page. Leave one copy with someone staying at home, and keep 
another copy with you on your trip, separate from your actual passport. 
If you do lose your passport, bring the copy to your consulate. It may help 
speed up the process of getting a new passport.
Renting a Car in London — Not!
Having a car in London is more trouble than it’s worth for the following 
reasons:
 
✓ Maneuvering through London’s congested and complicated maze 
of streets can be an endurance test even for Londoners.
 
✓ Navigating the city in heavy traffic while driving on the left-hand 
side of the road, when you’re used to driving on the right-hand 
side, can turn even the best driver into a gibbering nut case.
 
✓ Parking is difficult to find and expensive (street meters cost 
£1/$1.65 for 20 minutes).
 
✓ Congestion pricing (road tolls) makes driving in and out of Central 
London pricey.
 
✓ Gas (petrol in Britspeak) currently costs over £1 per liter (or 
approximately $6.25 a gallon).
 
✓ Public transportation — especially the Tube — will get you every-
where you want to go at a fraction of the cost.
Do yourself a favor: Forget about renting a car. If you want to be with 
Londoners on their own turf (or in their own tunnels), the Tube 
(Underground) is a great way to do it. Even if you’re planning excursions 
outside London, the trains are a better option. (However, see Chapter 14 
for details on renting a car for day-tripping.)

Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
The types of insurance travelers are most likely to need are trip-
cancellation insurance and medical insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your 
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates 
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost 
and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more than a 
dozen companies.
Most big travel agencies offer their own insurance and will probably try 
to sell you their package when you book a holiday. Think before you sign, 
and insist on seeing the policy and reading the fine print before buying.
Here’s my advice on trip-cancellation and medical insurance.
 
✓ Trip-cancellation insurance will help retrieve your money if you 
have to back out of a trip or depart early, or if your travel supplier 
goes bankrupt. Trip-cancellation insurance traditionally covers 
such events as sickness, natural disasters, and State Department 
advisories. The latest news in trip-cancellation insurance is the 
availability of “any-reason” cancellation coverage, which costs 
more but covers cancellations made for any reason. You won’t get 
back 100 percent of your prepaid trip cost, but you’ll be refunded a 
substantial portion. TravelSafe Insurance (% 888/885-7233; www.
travelsafe.com) offers both types of coverage. Expedia also 
offers any-reason cancellation coverage for its air-hotel packages. 
For detailed information on rates and coverage, contact one of the 
following recommended insurers: Access America (% 866/807-
3982; www.accessamerica.com); Travel Guard International 
(% 800/826-4919; www.travelguard.com); Travel Insured 
International (% 800/243-3174; www.travelinsured.com); 
and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888/457-4602; www.
travelex-insurance.com).
 
✓ For travel to England, you may want to look into medical insur-
ance. Most U.S. health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) do 
not provide coverage, and the ones that do often require you to pay 
for services upfront and then reimburse you.
 
✓ If you require additional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance 
(% 410/453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance 
International (% 800/821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; 
for general information on services, call the company’s Worldwide 
Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800/777-8710).
 
✓ Canadians should check with their provincial health plan offices or 
call Health Canada (% 866/225-0709; www.hc-sc.gc.ca) to find 
out the extent of their coverage and what documentation and 
receipts they must take home in case they’re treated in England.

 Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 73
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. (Of 
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more 
than they probably listen to you.)
 
 For travel abroad, you may have to pay all medical costs upfront and be 
reimbursed later. For information on purchasing additional medical insur-
ance for your trip, see the preceding section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/
or chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart 
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888/633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition 
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour 
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to 
Travelers (IAMAT; % 716/754-4883 in the U.S., 416/652-0137 in Canada; 
www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries 
that you’re visiting.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
The cheapest and easiest way to call home from London, I’ve found, is to 
use a prepaid phone card and the hotel phone. If you’re accustomed to 
using a cellphone, keep in mind that your U.S. phone may not work in 
the U.K. (see below); and even if you can use it, international roaming 
fees are often astronomical. Renting a phone in London, although possi-
ble, also costs a lot. Collecting e-mail is fairly easy in London: If you 
can’t do it at your hotel, the staff will be able to direct you to the nearest 
cybercafe — be forewarned, however, that cybercafes with rentable 
computers becoming increasingly scarce. In this section, I provide gen-
eral information on using cellphones and sending or receiving e-mail 
in London.

Using a cellphone outside the U.S.
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities 
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that 
makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and 
dozens of other countries worldwide. In the United States, T-Mobile and 
AT&T Wireless use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell and 
some Rogers customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most 
Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable mul-
tiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung 
models, you can make and receive calls across developed areas through-
out much of the world, from Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless 
operator and ask for international roaming to be activated on your 
account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high — usually $1 to 
$1.50 in England and Western Europe. If you have a smartphone, be sure 
to ask about international data packages, as well. Otherwise you could 
be hit with steep per-kilobyte fees.
That’s why buying an unlocked world phone from the get-go is a good 
idea. Many cellphone operators sell locked phones that restrict you 
from using any removable computer memory phone chip (called a SIM 
card) other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone allows 
you to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in 
England. (Show your phone to the salesperson; not all phones work on 
all networks.) You’ll get a local phone number — and much, much lower 
calling rates. If you’re staying in England for an extended period of time, 
buying a prepaid British SIM card may be your best bet. Getting an 
already locked phone unlocked can be a complicated process, but it can 
be done; just call your cellular operator and say you’ll be going abroad 
for several months and want to use the phone with a local provider.
For many people, renting a phone is a good idea. Although you can rent 
a phone from any number of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports 
and at car rental agencies, I suggest renting the phone before you leave 
home. That way, you can give loved ones and business associates your 
new number, make sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever 
you go — especially helpful for overseas trips through several countries, 
where local phone rental agencies often bill in local currency and may 
not let you take the phone to another country.
However, phone rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per 
week, plus airtime fees of at least $1 a minute. If you’re traveling to 
England, though, local rental companies often offer free incoming calls 
within their home country, which can save you big bucks. The bottom 
line: Shop around.
Rent-a-phone (% 800/400-7221 in the U.S., or 0800/317-540) is an inter-
national cellphone rental company with offices in the United States and 
United Kingdom; per-minute charges from England are generally about 

 Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 75
$2 per minute to the United States and Europe, and the phones can be 
delivered to your door in the U.S. before you leave.
In Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at Heathrow Airport, you can buy a range 
of cellphones and services, including SIM cards, at Primus (% 020/8607-
5960).
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800/872-
7626; www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888/290-1606 or 
905/272-5665; www.roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and 
they’ll tell you what wireless products you need. InTouch will also, for 
free, advise you on whether your existing phone will work overseas; 
simply call % 703/222-7161, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. eastern standard 
time, or go to www.intouchglobal.com/travel.htm.
Checking your e-mail
You have any number of ways to check your e-mail and access the 
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA), smartphone, or electronic organizer with a 
modem — gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a 
computer, you can still access your e-mail and even your office com-
puter from cybercafes.
Without your own computer
It’s hard nowadays to find a city in England that doesn’t have a few 
cybercafes, though you won’t find any in smaller towns and villages. 
No definitive directory of cybercafes exists — these are independent 
businesses, after all — but two places to start looking are at The 
Cybercafe Search Engine (www.cybercaptive.com) and Cybercafes 
(www.cybercafe.com).
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at 
least one computer on which you can access the Internet. And most 
public libraries offer Internet access free or for a small charge. If you 
want to save money, avoid hotel business centers unless you can use 
the service for free. Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scat-
tered throughout their gates. These kiosks, which you also see in shop-
ping malls, hotel lobbies, and tourist information offices around the 
world, give you basic Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually 
higher than cybercafe prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high prices 
mean that you probably want to avoid them whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP) if it has 
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP 
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service 
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more 
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with 
Gmail (www.gmail.com) or Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). 
If you have AOL, you can access your e-mail online at www.aol.com. 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
76
You may be able to get your home ISP to forward your e-mail to the 
Web-based account automatically.
With your own computer
If you’re bringing your own computer with Wi-Fi, you’ll be happy to 
know that more and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as 
wireless Internet hotspots. You can get a Wi-Fi connection one of several 
ways. Nearly every laptop sold in the last few years has built-in Wi-Fi 
capability. If you have an older computer, you can plug a Wi-Fi card 
(around $50) into your laptop.
You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone ser-
vice, through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies 
that have made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and 
coffee shops, primarily in the United States (followed by the U.K. and 
Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up 
wireless connections at Starbucks coffee shops throughout England. 
Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set 
up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass providers 
also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel-lobby setups. Best 
of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s 
network; just set yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby. The compa-
nies’ pricing policies can be byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-
connection, and per-minute plans, but in general, you pay around $30 a 
month for limited access — and as more and more companies jump on 
the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more competitive.
Some places in cities around the world also provide free wireless net-
works. To locate these free hotspots, go to http://wiki.personal
telco.net/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels 
throughout England and the rest of the United Kingdom offer dataports 
for laptop modems, and many offer free high-speed Internet access using 
an Ethernet network cable. You can bring your own cables, but most 
hotels rent them for around $10. Call your hotel in advance to see what 
your options are.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world, 
allowing you to go online by simply placing a local call. Contact your ISP 
and ask how you can use your current account away from home, and 
how much it will cost. If you’re traveling outside the reach of your ISP, 
the iPass network has dial-up numbers in most of the world’s countries. 
You’ll have to sign up with an iPass provider, who will then tell you how 
to set up your computer for your destination. For a list of iPass provid-
ers, go to www.ipass.com. One solid provider is i2roam (% 866/811-
6209 or 920/235-0475; www.i2roam.com).

 Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 77
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone 
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or 
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
North American current runs 110V, 60 cycles; the standard voltage 
throughout Britain is 240V AC, 50 cycles. You need a current converter 
or transformer to bring the voltage down and the cycles up. Two-
pronged North American plugs won’t fit into the three-pronged square 
British wall sockets, so you also need a three-pronged square adapter 
and converter if you use North American laptops or appliances while 
in England. Australian and New Zealand plugs won’t fit, although the 
electrical current is the same as it is in England. Plug adapters and con-
verters are available at most travel, luggage, electronics, and hardware 
stores. Some plug adapters are also current converters. Most contempo-
rary laptop computers automatically sense the current and adapt 
accordingly.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S. 
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be 
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and 
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee, and she can probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license 
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security 
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not 
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for 
international flights to most countries.)
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. If you have an 
E-ticket, you can beat the ticket counter lines by using airport electronic 
kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer (electronic 
check-in is not available for most international flights, however). Online 
check-in involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your 
reservation, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may 
even offer you bonus miles to do so. If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, 
bring the credit card that you used to book the ticket or your frequent-
flier card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply pro-
ceed to the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re 
checking bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat for the domestic por-
tion of your flight to London, you’ll be able to do so using most airline 
kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the kiosk system, but 
always call your airline to make sure these alternatives are available. 
Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few air-
lines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go. If your trip requires 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
78
you to fly to another U.S. airport to get your flight to London, chances 
are that you must check in at the airline counter, showing your pass-
port, for your international flight.
When you’re returning from London via Heathrow or Gatwick airports, 
be prepared for long lines and multiple security checks. If you have trou-
ble standing for long periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline 
will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing metal 
objects such as big belt buckles. Keep in mind that only ticketed passen-
gers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting disabled pas-
sengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t. 
The general rule is that sharp things are out, but nail clippers are okay. 
Any liquids or gels must be in 3-ounce or smaller containers and placed 
in a see-through 1-quart resealable plastic bag, which is put separately 
through the scanner. (After you’ve passed through security, you can buy 
bottled water and bring it on the plane.) Travelers in the United States 
are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a personal item (such as a purse, 
briefcase, or laptop bag). Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of things 
into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still considered a 
personal item. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has 
issued a list of restricted items; you can find the list at www.tsa.gov/
travelers/airtravel.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be 
searched by hand. You can purchase luggage locks that allow screeners 
to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is necessary. 
Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops and 
Brookstone stores (or online at www.brookstone.com). These locks, 
approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage inspectors with a 
special code or key. For more information on the locks, visit www.
travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-approved 
locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to 
hand-search your luggage.

lthough London is among the world’s largest cities, both in size 
and population, its neighborhoods were once small, separate vil-
lages. With urban roots (and routes) that hark back to Roman times, 
London isn’t always the easiest city to navigate. Streets aren’t organized 
in a grid, and although most have been paved and modernized, a few old 
lanes here and there still have cobblestones. This quaint, villagelike 
quality is one reason for London’s enduring charm, but charm is little 
comfort when you’re trying to find your way around in a strange city. 
This chapter helps you get your bearings. Neighborhood boundaries 
come later in this chapter, too. First, you need to get from the airport or 
train station into Central London.
Getting through Passport Control and Customs
Have your passport ready because your first stop after deplaning is 
Passport Control (for details on getting a passport, see Chapter 7). The 
procedure is fairly routine. On the plane, you fill out a landing card, 
which asks for your name, home address, passport number, and the 
address where you’ll be staying in London. Present the completed card 
with your passport to the official at Passport Control. The official may 
ask for the following information:
 
✓ Length of your stay (you can only stay up to 3 months, if you don’t 
have a visa)
 
✓ Where you plan to stay

Part III: Settling into London 
82
 
✓ Purpose of your trip (business or pleasure)
 
✓ Your next destination
 
✓ How much money you have with you
Although you may think that the question about your finances is snoopy 
impertinence, officials have good reason to ask. They want to verify that 
people entering England won’t apply for some kind of welfare or national 
health-insurance benefits and become a burden on the country.
Officials may stamp your passport without asking a thing. After your 
passport is stamped, proceed to pick up your luggage. From there, you 
wind your way out through the Customs Hall.
At the Customs area, you get two choices: “Nothing to Declare” and 
“Goods to Declare.” Chances are that you won’t be declaring anything, 
in which case, you walk right through. Limits on imports for visitors age 
17 and older entering England include the following:
 
✓ 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 250 grams (8.8 oz.) of loose tobacco
 
✓ 2 liters (2.1 qt.) of still table wine
 
✓ 1 liter (1 qt.) of liquor over 22 percent alcohol by volume, or 2 liters 
(2.1 qt.) of liquor under 22 percent
 
✓ 2 fluid ounces of perfume
If you fall within these limits, go through the “Nothing to Declare” area at 
Customs. You may, however, be stopped for a random luggage search. 
Don’t take it personally if this happens. Unless you’re smuggling in con-
traband, you have nothing to worry about.
For details on duty-free shopping and limits on what you can bring back 
home, see Chapter 12.
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
You’re in London! Well, almost. First, you have to get from the airport or 
train station to your hotel. I fill you in on all your options from each air-
port in the following sections.
Arriving at Heathrow
About 24km (15 miles) west of Central London, Heathrow (% 0870/000-
0123; www.baa.co.uk) is the largest of London’s airports, as well as 
one of the world’s busiest, with five passenger terminals serving flights 
from around the globe. Signposts mark just about everything, and 
moving walkways make the trek through the long corridors easy. You’ll 
probably arrive at terminal 3, 4, or 5:

 Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83
 
✓ Terminals 3 and 4 are for non-British, long-haul flights.
 
✓ Terminal 5 is for British Airways intercontinental flights.
After clearing Customs (see the section “Getting through Passport 
Control and Customs,” earlier in this chapter), you enter the main con-
course of your terminal. You can pick up a free map and general info 
from the Tourist Information Centre, in the Underground concourse of 
terminals 1, 2, and 3 (Oct–May daily 8 a.m.–6 p.m.; June–Sept Mon–Sat 
8 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun 8 a.m.–6 p.m.). You can also find ATMs, hotel booking 
agencies (see Chapter 9), theater booking services, and several banks 
and bureaux de change, where you can swap your dollars or traveler’s 
checks for pounds and pence (see Chapter 4 for details on changing 
money).
You have several options for getting into the city. The London 
Underground (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk/tube), also called 
the Tube, is the London subway system and the cheapest mode of public 
transportation for most Central London destinations (see the inside 
back cover of this book for a map of the Underground). All terminals at 
Heathrow link up with the Tube system. Follow the Underground signs 
to the ticket booth. The Piccadilly line gets you into Central London in 
about 45 minutes for a fare of £4 ($6.60). Underground trains run from all 
four Heathrow terminals every five to nine minutes Monday through 
Saturday 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and Sunday 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
 
 The one potential hassle with the Underground is that the Tube trains 
don’t have luggage racks. Stash your bags as best you can — behind your 
legs, on your lap, or near the center doors where there’s more space. Keep 
in mind that, during rush hour, the trains become increasingly packed as 
you get closer to London. To reach your hotel on the Underground, you 
may have to change trains or take a cab from the Underground station 
closest to your destination.
If the Underground is closed, you can ride the N97 night bus from 
Heathrow to Central London. Buses (located in front of the terminals) 
run every 30 minutes Monday through Saturday midnight to 5 a.m. and 
Sunday 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. The trip takes about an hour; a one-way fare 
costs £2 ($3.30).
The buses operated by National Express (% 08701/781-8181; www.
nationalexpress.com) may be a better alternative to the 
Underground if you have lots of heavy luggage. The trip from the airport 
to Victoria Coach Station takes between 45 and 75 minutes, and costs 
from £10 ($17), payable on the bus. Up to three buses per hour depart 
daily from 4 a.m. to 11:23 p.m. from the coach station in front of 
Heathrow’s terminals 3 and 4.
The Heathrow Express (% 0845/600-1515; www.heathrowexpress.
co.uk) is a dedicated train line running from all five Heathrow terminals 

Part III: Settling into London 
84
to London’s Paddington Station in only 15 minutes. The trains have air-
conditioning, ergonomically designed seating, and plenty of luggage 
space. The Express-class (standard) fare costs £17 ($28). You can buy 
tickets at the airport or onboard the train (for an additional £2/$3.30 
charge). Service runs daily every 15 minutes, from 5 a.m. to 11:45 p.m.
If you’re travel-weary, you may want the luxury of taking a taxi directly 
to your hotel. Taxis are especially cost effective if four or five people are 
traveling together. You can order one at the Taxi Information booths in 
Terminal 3 (% 020/8745-4655) or Terminal 4 (% 020/8745-7302). 
Expect to pay about £50 to £60 ($83–$99), plus tip (15 percent of the 
total fare), for a trip of about 45 minutes. Cabs are available 24 hours a 
day. Wheelchair facilities are available at all times for the disabled.
Arriving at calmer Gatwick
Gatwick (% 0870/000-2468; www.baa.co.uk) is considerably smaller 
than Heathrow but basically provides the same services, except that 
there’s no tourist information office here. Gatwick is about 45km (28 
miles) south of Central London and handles national and international 
flights from some U.S. airlines; international flights come in at the South 
Terminal. Gatwick also has a North Terminal.
It’s about time! Heathrow’s 
new Terminal 5
Heathrow Airport was initially built to serve about 45 million passengers a year, but for 
a decade now its four terminals have been processing upwards of 70 million. The over-
crowding was so bad that passengers voted Heathrow their least favorite airport world-
wide in a 2006 poll by TripAdvisor. Some of that passenger crush was alleviated in 
March 2008, when Heathrow opened its new Terminal 5.
The new terminal, which serves British Airways, is a radical departure from the other 
four. Designed by architect Richard Rodgers, it features light stone floors (instead of 
much-tramped carpeting) and glass facades (instead of windowless corridors) that 
provide views of Windsor Castle and Wembley Stadium. With some 112 retail outlets, 
including upscale stores like Prada and Harrods, shopping is a major component of the 
new terminal, as are eating and drinking — the terminal includes bars, cafes, and a 
restaurant from celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay featuring a one-hour menu.
Now that Terminal 5 is up and running, Terminal 2 will be demolished and a new 
Heathrow East Terminal will be built on its site. When the East Terminal is open, 
Terminal 1 will be closed and Terminal 3 will be expanded. By that time — a decade or 
more away — Heathrow will be back to its original four terminals. But what’s really 
needed, say many, is another runway.

 Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85
 
 If you land at Gatwick rather than Heathrow, you have fewer transporta-
tion options into Central London. The highway system from Gatwick into 
London is far less efficient than from Heathrow, so buses, minivans, or 
cabs can end up taking two or three hours in heavy traffic.
Your quickest way of getting into Central London from Gatwick is the 
convenient Gatwick Express train (% 0845/850-1530; www.gatwick
express.com). You can board the train right in the South Terminal, and 
in about 30 minutes, you’ll be at Victoria Station. The trip costs £17 
($28) for Express class; First class, which has reclining chairs and 
refreshment service, costs £25 ($41). Trains run daily every 15 minutes 
from 5:50 a.m. to 1:35 a.m.
Southern Train (% 08451/272-920; www.southernrailway.com), a 
local passenger train, runs to Victoria Station in 30 minutes and costs 
£8.90 ($15). Four trains an hour run during the day; they run hourly from 
midnight to 5 a.m.
National Express buses (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.
com) provide service from the airport to Victoria Coach Station in 
Central London, departing from both the North and South terminals. The 
fare is £6.60 ($11), payable on the bus.
For 24-hour taxi service between Gatwick and Central London (the fare 
will be £65–£75/$107–$124), call Barker’s Plus (% 01293/562-291). You 
can order a taxi at the Taxi Information booth when you arrive at 
Gatwick Airport. The fares runs £65 ($107), plus tip, for the journey that 
takes about 90 minutes.
Touching down at another airport
If you fly into London from elsewhere in Europe, you may arrive at an 
airport other than Heathrow or Gatwick. The following sections help you 
navigate from these less-used facilities.
Stansted: For national and European flights
Stansted (% 0870/000-0303; www.stanstedairport.com) is a single-
terminal airport used for national and European flights. The airport is 
about 80km (50 miles) northeast of Central London. The Stansted 
Express train (% 0845/600-7245) to Liverpool Street Station takes 45 
minutes and costs £16 ($26). Trains run every 15 minutes daily 5:30 a.m. 
to 11:59 p.m. Taxi fare into the city averages about £65 ($107), plus tip.
London City Airport: European destinations only
London City Airport (% 020/7646-000; www.londoncityairport.
com) is a mere 10km (6 miles) east of the city center, and it services only 
European destinations. A new extension of the Docklands Light Railway 
(DLR) travels from the airport to Bank Street, in Central London, in 22 

Part III: Settling into London 
86
minutes for £4 ($6.60); the Underground requires an additional fare, if 
you’re traveling beyond Bank Street. A taxi to the vicinity of Marble Arch 
costs about £30 ($50), plus tip.
London Luton: Serving European charters
London Luton Airport (% 01582/405-100; www.london-luton.co.uk) 
services European charter flights. This small, independent airport is 
about 45km (28 miles) northwest of the city. Travel by free shuttle bus 
to Luton Airport Parkway station, then take a First Capital Connect 
train to St. Pancras International Station in Central London for £11 ($18); 
the trip takes 30 to 45 minutes. Taxis into the city cost about £50 ($83), 
plus tip.
Arriving by train
If you’re coming from the Continent, you cross the English Channel and 
disembark at one of the United Kingdom’s Channel ports. The ports clos-
est to London are Dover, Folkestone, and Ramsgate to the east, and 
Newhaven, Portsmouth, and Southampton to the south. The QEII cruise 
ship also docks at Southampton.
Trains connecting with ferries on the U.K. side of the Channel generally 
go to Liverpool Street Station, Victoria Station, or Waterloo 
International. Train passage to London is included in the ferry fee. The 
newly reopened (in 2007) King’s Cross/St. Pancras International Station 
is where the Eurostar Chunnel trains arrive from Paris and Brussels. On 
the Eurostar, you don’t have to make any train-to-boat-to-train transfers 
along the way. (For more on the Eurostar, see Chapter 5.)
All London stations link to the Underground system. Just look for the 
Underground symbol (a circle with a line through it). The stations con-
nect to the Underground as follows:
 
✓ Liverpool Street is on the Circle, East London, Metropolitan, and 
Central lines.
 
✓ Victoria is on the District, Circle, and Victoria lines.
 
✓ Waterloo is linked to the Northern and Bakerloo lines.
 
✓ King’s Cross/St. Pancras is on the Piccadilly and Northern lines.
Taxis wait outside all train stations. See the “Getting Around London” 
section, later in this chapter, for more information on the London 
Underground and taxis.
London’s train stations are swarming with activity. You find bookstores, 
bureaux de change, restaurants, newsstands, hotel reservation agencies, 
and many of the services that airports traditionally offer.

 Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 87
 
 Keep in mind that the United Kingdom, like the rest of Europe, uses the 
24-hour clock for rail and other timetables, which means that 0530 is 5:30 
a.m., 1200 is noon, and 1830 is 6:30 p.m. Just continue counting up from 
noon: 1300 = 1 p.m., 1400 = 2 p.m., 1500 = 3 p.m., and so on up to 2400 
(midnight). In this book, I stick to the American a.m. and p.m. system. Like 
most of the rest of the world, London goes on daylight saving time from 
April through October.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Londoners orient themselves by neighborhood (see the “London’s 
Neighborhoods” map on p. 88). Sounds simple enough, but with 
London’s confusing and sometimes oddly named streets and its seemingly 
endless plethora of neighborhoods, you may have a hard time telling 
where one neighborhood leaves off and another begins. For orientation 
purposes, I give you major streets as boundary markers. But be aware 
that the neighborhoods frequently bleed beyond these principal arteries.
 
 To help you find your way around, I strongly suggest that you buy a copy 
of London A–Z. (Americans take note: Ask for “London A to Zed,” because 
z is pronounced zed in the U.K.) You can pick up this indexed London 
street map at just about any bookstore or newsstand (you may want to get 
it while you’re at the airport).
Although Greater London encompasses a whopping 1,610 sq. km (622 
sq. miles), the main tourist portion covers only a fraction (65 sq. km/25 
sq. miles, at the most) of that distance. Most sites within this 65km (25-
mile) range are convenient to the Underground system (the Tube). You 
may have a short (10-minute or less) walk from the Tube stop to your 
destination, but London is flat, and for walkers, it’s a dream.
London is divided into postal districts. All London street addresses 
include a designation such as SW1 or EC3. (In London, the postal dis-
tricts are related to where they lie geographically from the original post 
office, which was at St. Martin-le-Grand in the City.) Addresses in the 
City of London, the easternmost portion of Central London, have desig-
nations such as EC2, EC3, or EC4. As you move west, the codes change 
accordingly to W, WC, SW, NW, and so on.
 
 You don’t need to bother yourself with postal districts except when you’re 
mailing something to London or looking up streets in London A–Z (many 
streets in different parts of London have the same name). When you actu-
ally hit the streets, the postal district designations aren’t as important as 
the nearest Tube stop.
London grew up along the north and south banks of the Thames River, 
which snakes through the city in a long, loose S-curve. This great tidal

Part III: Settling into London 
90
river played a fundamental role in London’s growth, development, and 
prosperity. London’s major tourist sights, hotels, and restaurants are on 
the river’s north bank, and many of the city’s famous performing-arts 
venues are along the south bank.
Central London, on the north bank of the Thames, is considered the city 
center — the area covered by the Underground’s Circle line. Paddington 
Station anchors the northwestern corner, Earl’s Court marks the south-
western corner, Tower Hill sits at the southeast corner, and Liverpool 
Street Station anchors the northeastern corner. Central London is divided 
into three areas: the City, the West End, and West London. In the descrip-
tions that follow, I start at the City and move west from there.
The City of London: The heart of it all
A self-governing entity that extends south from Chiswell Street to the 
River Thames, the City of London is bounded on the west by Chancery 
Lane and to the east by the Tower of London, the City’s most important 
historic monument.
Fleet Street, associated with printing and publishing since the 1500s but 
now a little forlorn since the departure of most of its newspaper offices, 
cuts through the center of the district to Ludgate Circus, where it 
becomes Ludgate. Follow that road, and you get to St. Paul’s Cathedral, 
its massive dome beautifully illuminated at night. St. Paul’s is just one of 
the buildings built atop the ancient area known as the City.
Covering the original 2.6 sq. km (1 sq. mile) that the Romans called 
Londinium, the City encompasses the territory between Moorfields to 
the north and the Thames to the south, and from Aldgate to the east and 
Temple Bar to the west. Today, this area is the Wall Street of England, 
home to the Bank of England, the Royal Exchange, and the Stock 
Exchange, as well as the new Lloyds of London building and the 
NatWest Tower, London’s second tallest building. You also find the 
Museum of London, the remains of the Roman Temple of Mithras, the 
church of St. Stephen Walbrook (designed by Sir Christopher Wren), 
the Wren-designed Monument that commemorates the Great Fire of 
London in 1666, and the Barbican Centre, a mega-size arts complex of 
theaters and concert halls.
Liverpool Street Station is the main rail terminus in this area. The major 
Tube stops are Bank, Barbican, Blackfriars, Liverpool Street Station, 
Moorgate, St. Paul’s, and Tower Hill.
The West End: Downtown London
The West End (that is, west of the City) is “downtown” London. The 
West End is known for the theater, entertainment, and shopping areas 
around Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square. But a host of neighbor-
hoods make up the West End. I describe them briefly in the sections 
that follow.

 Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 91
Holborn
Abutting the City of London to the west is the old borough of Holborn, 
the legal heart of London and home to the Inns of Court, Lincoln’s Inn 
Fields, Old Bailey, and the Royal Courts of Justice.
This “in-between” district is bounded roughly by Theobald’s Road, to 
the north; Farringdon Road, to the east; the Thames, to the south; and 
Kingsway, Aldwych, and Lancaster Place, to the west. The major Tube 
stops are Aldwych, Blackfriars, Holborn, and Temple.
The Strand and Covent Garden
The northern section of the Strand, the area west of Holborn, is Covent 
Garden, with Shaftesbury Avenue as its northern boundary. Covent 
Garden has many theaters, eateries, and shops and is home to the Royal 
Opera House and Covent Garden Market, one of the busiest shopping 
areas in London. Covent Garden is an area for strolling, shopping, and 
stopping for tea or a meal.
Formerly one of the premier streets in England, the Strand (the same 
name as the neighborhood) runs from Trafalgar Square to Fleet Street; 
the Strand is the principal thoroughfare along the southern edge, with 
Charing Cross Road to the west and Kingsway, Aldwych, and Lancaster 
Place to the east. Cleopatra’s Needle, an Egyptian obelisk dating from 
about 1475 B.C. and moved to England in 1878, is located in the Victoria 
Embankment, on the north side of the Hungerford Bridge. The major 
Tube stops are Charing Cross, Covent Garden, and Leicester Square.
Bloomsbury
Just north of Covent Garden, New Oxford Street and Bloomsbury Way 
mark the beginnings of the Bloomsbury district, home of the British 
Museum and several colleges and universities, as well as the only surviv-
ing London home of novelist Charles Dickens.
This intellectual pocket of Central London was home to the famed 
Bloomsbury Group, whose members included novelist Virginia Woolf 
and historian Lytton Strachey. Bloomsbury is bounded to the east by 
Woburn Place and Southampton Row, to the north by Euston Road, and 
to the west by Tottenham Court Road. The major Tube stops are Euston 
Square, Goodge Street, Russell Square, and Tottenham Court Road.
Soho
This lively area is full of restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs, and nightclubs 
and is popular with the gay community. London’s Gay Village is cen-
tered on Old Compton Street. Gerrard Street is one of the main streets of 
Chinatown. Much of Soho used to be a down-to-earth Italian neighbor-
hood, but the area later became known for its strip joints and porn pal-
aces. You still see remnants of the sex-’n’-sleaze era, but most of it is 
now gone, and things are going upscale.

Part III: Settling into London 
92
The Soho neighborhood occupies the maze of densely packed streets 
north of Shaftesbury Avenue, west of Charing Cross Road, east of Regent 
Street, and south of Oxford Street. The major Tube stops are Covent 
Garden, Leicester Square, and Tottenham Court Road.
Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Charing Cross
This area, just west of the Strand, is “downtown” London or 
Theatreland. Piccadilly Circus, with its landmark statue of Eros, is the 
area’s major traffic hub and best-known tourist destination, feeding into 
Regent Street and Piccadilly. The Royal Academy of Arts is just west of 
Piccadilly Circus. A few minutes’ walk to the east puts you at Leicester 
Square and Shaftesbury Avenue, where you find most of the West End 
theaters. From Leicester Square, Charing Cross Road runs south to 
Trafalgar Square, with its delightful fountains and four immense bronze 
lions guarding its corners. Around the square, you see the National 
Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery. Charing Cross Road is well 
known for its bookshops. The Tube stops are Charing Cross, Leicester 
Square, and Piccadilly Circus.
Mayfair
Elegant and exclusive, Mayfair is luxury-hotel and luxury-shopping land. 
The area is nestled among Regent Street on the east, Oxford Street on 
the north, Piccadilly on the south, and Hyde Park on the west. The major 
Tube stops are Bond Street, Hyde Park Corner, Marble Arch, and 
Piccadilly Circus.
Marylebone
In a sense, Marylebone (pronounced mar-lee-bone) is “Medical London” 
because the area has several hospitals and the famous Harley Street 
Clinic. But perhaps the most famous street is Baker Street, home of the 
fictional Sherlock Holmes. Madame Tussauds wax museum is on 
Marylebone Road.
Marylebone is the neighborhood north of Mayfair and Bloomsbury and 
is capped to the north by giant Regent’s Park. (Marylebone Road runs 
south of the park.) Great Portland Street is the area’s eastern boundary 
and Edgware Road the western. The major Tube stops are Baker Street, 
Marylebone, and Regent’s Park.
St. James’s
St. James’s is “royal London,” a posh green haven beginning at Piccadilly 
and moving southwest to include Green Park and St. James’s Park, with 
Buckingham Palace between them and St. James’s Palace across from 
St. James’s Park.
Pall Mall (pronounced pell mell), lined with exclusive “gentlemen’s 
clubs,” runs roughly east–west into the area and meets the north–south 
St. James’s Street. Regent Street is the eastern boundary. The Tube 
stops are Green Park and St. James’s Park.

 Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 93
Westminster
East and south of St. James’s, Westminster draws visitors to 
Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, the seat of British 
government.
Westminster extends from Northumberland Avenue, just south of 
Charing Cross, to Vauxhall Bridge Road, with the Thames to the east and 
St. James’s Park to the west. Victoria Station, on the northwestern 
perimeter, is a kind of axis for Belgravia, Pimlico, and Westminster. The 
Tube stops are St. James’s Park, Victoria, and Westminster.
Pimlico
The pie-shaped wedge extending west from Vauxhall Bridge Road to 
Buckingham Palace Road is Pimlico. Crowning the area to the north is 
Victoria Station. Near the Vauxhall Bridge is the Tate Britain gallery. The 
Tube stops are Pimlico and Victoria.
Belgravia
A posh quarter long favored by aristocrats, Belgravia is where many for-
eign embassies are located. Beginning west of Victoria Station and Green 
Park, Belgravia extends south to the river and west to Sloane Street; 
Hyde Park is its northern boundary. The Tube stops are Hyde Park, 
Sloane Square, and Victoria.
Central London: Parks, museums, and more
West of the West End, you find Central London’s residential, cultural, and 
shopping attractions, including beautiful gardens and popular museums.
Knightsbridge
West of Belgravia is the fashionable residential and shopping district of 
Knightsbridge, bounded to the north by Hyde Park and to the west by 
Brompton Road. Here you find Harrods, the famed department store 
that has been a London shopping staple for a century and a half. 
Running through the neighborhood is pretty Beauchamp (pronounced 
beech-um) Place, with its expensive boutiques. The Tube stops are 
Knightsbridge and Sloane Square.
Chelsea
South of Knightsbridge and west of Belgravia, artsy, trendy Chelsea 
begins at Sloane Square and runs south to Cheyne Walk and Chelsea 
Embankment along the Thames. The famous King’s Road acts as its 
northern boundary and Chelsea Bridge Road its eastern border. To the 
west, the area extends as far as Earl’s Court Road, Redcliffe Gardens, 
and Edith Grove. In Chelsea, you find Carlyle’s House and the lovely 
and historic Chelsea Physic Garden. The annual Chelsea Flower Show 
is held on the grounds of Chelsea Royal Hospital. The Tube stop is 
Sloane Square.

Part III: Settling into London 
94
South Kensington
Forming the green northern boundary of South Kensington are 
Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. South Ken is London’s museum 
capital — including the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, and 
Victoria and Albert Museum — and is packed with hotels and 
restaurants.
South Kensington is bounded to the south by Brompton Road, to the 
west by Gloucester (pronounced gloss-ter) Road, and to the east by 
Fulham Road. The Tube stops are Gloucester Road and South 
Kensington.
Kensington
The residential neighborhood of Kensington fills in the gap between 
Kensington Gardens and Holland Park, with Notting Hill Gate and 
Bayswater Road marking the northern boundary. Kensington Church 
Street runs north–south between Notting Hill Gate and Kensington 
High Street. The Tube stop is High Street Kensington.
Earl’s Court
This down-to-earth neighborhood has long been a haven for budget trav-
elers (particularly Australians — hence its nickname, Kangaroo Court) 
and for gays and lesbians. Earl’s Court is gradually being renovated, but 
some streets still look a bit down at the heels. This area offers no major 
tourist attractions, but it does have some good hotels and B&Bs.
The area begins south of West Cromwell Road and extends south to 
Lillie Road and Brompton Road. Its western boundary is North End 
Road, and its eastern boundary is Earl’s Court Road. The Tube stop is 
Earl’s Court.
Notting Hill
Beginning north of Holland Park, Kensington Gardens, and Hyde Park 
(Holland Park Avenue and Bayswater Road run along the northern 
perimeter of the parks), you find the antiques shops of Notting Hill and 
the rising sub-neighborhood of Notting Hill Gate.
The area is bounded by Clarendon Road to the west, Queensway to the 
east, and Wesbourne Grove to the north. The most famous street, 
Portobello Road, runs north–south through the center. The neighbor-
hood served as a backdrop for the 1999 movie Notting Hill, starring Julia 
Roberts and Hugh Grant. The Tube stops are Bayswater, Notting Hill 
Gate, and Queensway.
Bayswater and Paddington
Picking up where Notting Hill ends, Bayswater runs east to meet 
Marylebone at Edgware Road. The roaring A40 (Westway) highway acts 

 Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 95
as its northern boundary. Paddington Station is in the northwestern 
corner of Bayswater.
This commercial area isn’t much to look at. The neighborhood offers 
no major tourist attractions, but it does have many budget B&Bs. 
The Tube stops are Edgware Road, Lancaster Gate, Marble Arch, and 
Paddington.
Shoreditch
London’s East End has no exact boundaries but basically extends east 
of the City to Canary Wharf. Historically, this part of London has always 
been home to working-class and immigrant communities. Today, the 
area known as Shoreditch is one of London’s hot new trend zones, espe-
cially the area around Hoxton Square. The primary tourist attraction in 
Shoreditch is the Geffrye Museum.
The South Bank
You most likely won’t be staying on the South Bank, but you may go 
there for a play, an exhibition, or a concert at one of its internationally 
known arts and performance venues or museums. The Tube stops are 
London Bridge, Southwark (pronounced suth-ick), and Waterloo.
The Hayward Gallery, the British Film Institute, the Royal National 
Theatre, and the South Bank Centre (which contains Royal Festival 
Hall and two smaller concert halls) are all clustered beside the river 
within easy walking distance of Waterloo Station. Closer to Westminster 
Bridge is the city’s newest high-rise attraction: the London Eye observa-
tion wheel.
For a scenic route to the South Bank, take the Tube to Embankment, 
on the north bank, and walk across the Thames on the new Hungerford 
Bridge for pedestrians. The Jubilee Walkway, a breezy riverside path, 
extends south from the arts complexes to the London Aquarium and 
north to the new Tate Modern, the Globe Theatre (a re-creation of the 
Elizabethan outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare), Southwark 
Cathedral, and Tower Bridge. The new pedestrian-only Millennium 
Bridge spans the Thames from the Tate Modern to St. Paul’s.
Finding Information after You Arrive
You can find hotel and theater booking agencies, a currency exchange, 
and numerous free brochures on river trips, walking tours, and day trips 
from London at the Britain & London Visitor Centre, 1 Regent St., 
Piccadilly Circus, SW1 (% 08701/566-366; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), 
which provides tourist information to walk-in visitors Monday 9:30 a.m. 
to 6:30 p.m., Tuesday through Friday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday 
and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (9 a.m.–5 p.m. June–Sept).

Tourist Information Centres (all of them for walk-in visitors, none of 
them with a phone number) are found in the following locations:
 
✓ City of London, St. Paul’s Churchyard (Tube: St. Paul’s Cathedral): 
Monday through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. to 
4:30 p.m.
 
✓ Euston Station (Tube: Euston): Monday through Saturday 7:15 a.m. 
to 9:15 p.m., Sunday 8:15 a.m. to 6:15 p.m.
 
✓ Liverpool Street Station (Tube: Liverpool Street): Monday through 
Saturday 7:15 a.m. to 9:15 p.m., Sunday 8:15 a.m. to 8:15 p.m.
 
✓ Victoria Station (Tube: Victoria): Monday through Saturday 7:15 
a.m. to 9:15 p.m., Sunday 8:15 a.m. to 8:15 p.m.
 
✓ Leicester Square (Tube: Leicester Square): Located at the half-
price ticket kiosk, the London Information Centre (run by 
LondonTown.com, an online marketing group) distributes free bus 
and Underground maps and can help with basic directions or ques-
tions; it’s open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., Saturday 
and Sunday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Getting Around London
You can choose many ways to get around London. If you travel for any 
distance, the fastest mode of transportation in this enormous city is the 
Tube (the subway system). Many of the slower but more scenic buses 
are double-deckers, but you also see new, energy-efficient buses. Most 
convenient (unless you’re stuck in a traffic jam) is to go by taxi. But 
walking is the most fun of all. When you’re on foot, you see more and 
can explore some of the leafy squares and cobbled lanes that contribute 
to London’s enduring charm.
For general London travel information, call Transport for London at 
% 020/7222-1234, or visit its Web site (www.tfl.gov.uk). You can get 
free bus and Underground maps and buy Travelcards and bus passes at 
any major Underground station (at the windows or from the machines) 
or at the London Travel Information Centres, in the stations at King’s 
Cross, Liverpool Street, Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus, St. James’s 
Park, and Victoria, and in Heathrow terminals 1, 2, and 3.
Taking the Underground (subway)
London has the oldest and most comprehensive subway system in the 
world. The Tube is fast and convenient, and just about everyone but the 
royals uses it. Everywhere you want to go is near a Tube stop, each of 
which is clearly marked by a red circle with a horizontal line through it. 
For an Underground map, see the inside back cover of this book.

 Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 97
Using the Underground
Thirteen Underground lines crisscross the city and intersect at various 
stations where you can change from one train to another. On 
Underground maps, every line is color-coded (Bakerloo is brown, 
Piccadilly is dark blue, and so on), which makes planning your route 
easy. All you need to know is the name of your stop and the direction 
you’re heading. After you figure out which line you need to take, look on 
the map for the name of the last stop in the direction you need to go. 
The name of the last stop on the line appears on the front of the train 
and also on electronic signboards that display the name of the arriving 
train. (The one exception to this rule is the Circle line, which runs in a 
loop around Central London.) Inside the trains, electronic signs, 
recorded voices, or both, announce the name of each approaching stop.
Traveling to your destination by Underground may require transferring 
from one Underground line to another. All Underground maps clearly 
show where various lines converge. Signs in the stations direct you from 
one line to another. To get from one line to another, you go through tun-
nels (which the Brits call subways), and you may have to go up or down 
a level or two.
The Underground system operates with automated entry and exit gates. 
If you have a regular paper ticket or Travelcard, you feed it into the slot; 
the ticket disappears and pops up again, the gate bangs open; you 
remove your ticket and pass through. Be sure to keep your ticket during 
your ride because you need it to get out. At the other end, you put your 
ticket through as you did upon entry, but this time the machine keeps 
the ticket (unless you have a multiuse Travelcard ticket, which the 
machine returns to you).
Traveling with an Oyster
A new kind of electronic Tube ticket called the Oyster recently went into effect, and its 
use is being encouraged over paper tickets. The plastic, reusable Oyster is like a trans-
portation debit card, and it’s a breeze to use: You load credit onto the Oyster at a ticket 
window (asking for, say, £20), and then simply touch the card to the electronic keypad 
on the turnstile and the gate opens. Using an Oyster, you get the lowest point-to-point 
fare available, a reduction that’s usually half the cost of a regular fare. A cash single 
fare on the bus, for example, costs £2 ($3.30), but with an Oyster card it’s only £1 ($1.65). 
For one-day stays, you still save considerably by purchasing a paper Travelcard (see 
the “Saving with Travelcards” section), but buying a reusable Oyster card may make 
more sense in certain situations. Consider where you’ll be traveling within London, how 
long you’ll be staying, and how much you plan on using the public transport system 
while you’re there.

Part III: Settling into London 
98
 
 Underground service stops around midnight (a little earlier on less-used 
lines). Keep this in mind when you’re out painting the town red. If you 
miss the last train, you must take a taxi or one of the night buses.
Buying tickets
You can purchase Underground tickets at the ticket window or from one 
of the automated machines found in most stations. Machines can change 
£5, £10, and £20 notes. Tickets are valid for use on the day of issue only.
For fare purposes, the city is divided into zones. Zone 1 covers all 
Central London. Zone 6 extends as far as Heathrow to the west and 
Upminster to the east. Make sure that your ticket covers all the zones 
that you’re traveling through (no problem if you’re staying in Central 
London), or you may have to pay a £10 ($17) penalty fare.
New pricing guidelines have raised the price of a one-way single cash 
fare within Zone 1 to a whopping £4 ($6.60) for adults and £2 ($3.30) for 
children 5 to 15. If you’re making more than one trip by Underground, you 
can save lots of money by purchasing a Travelcard or an Oyster card.
Saving with Travelcards
 
 To make the most of London’s public transportation system, consider 
buying a Travelcard, which allows unlimited travel by Underground 
and bus for a specific period of time within designated fare zones. You 
can purchase these cards (paper for 1 and 3 days, or a plastic Oyster 
version for 7 days) at any Tube station window or machine in the follow-
ing increments:
 
✓ A Day Travelcard, good for one day in zones 1 and 2 (everything in 
Central London), costs £7.20 ($12) adults, £3.60 ($5.95) children 5 
to 15. If you travel off-peak (after 9:30 a.m.), the price of an adult 
Day Travelcard drops to £5.60 ($9.25).
 
✓ The 3-Day Travelcard for zones 1 and 2 and valid at peak travel 
times (before 9:30 a.m.) costs £18 ($30) adults, £9.20 ($15) children 
5 to 15.
 
✓ A 7-Day Travelcard, issued as a plastic Oyster card and valid at 
peak travel times (before 9:30 a.m.) for zones 1 and 2 (all Central 
London) costs £26 ($43) adults, £13 ($21) children 5 to 15.
Another great way to save money on London transportation is the 
London Travelcard, which you can buy in the United States and Canada 
before leaving home. Keep in mind, though, that it’s actually a bit 
cheaper to buy Travelcards (including the London Travelcard) when 
you’re in London. (For details, see Chapter 4.)
Riding a bus
Distinctive red double-decker buses are very much a part of London’s 
snarled traffic scene, but not all London buses are double-deckers, 

 Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 99
and some aren’t red. (The old double-decker Routemaster buses, 
with the open backs that allowed you to literally hop on and off, have 
mostly disappeared from London streets — too many potential liability 
issues.) The one drawback to bus travel, especially for first-timers, 
is that you need to know the streets of London so you can get off at 
the correct stop. Get a free bus map at one of the Travel Information 
Centres (see “Finding Information after You Arrive,” earlier in this chap-
ter), or you may overshoot your destination. On the plus side, riding 
the bus is cheaper than taking the Tube; you don’t have to contend 
with escalators, elevators, or tunnels; and you get to see the sights as 
you travel.
A concrete post with a red or white sign on top reading LONDON TRANSPORT 
BUS SERVICE clearly marks each bus stop. Another sign shows the routes of 
the buses that stop there. If the sign on top is red, the stop is a request 
stop, meaning you must hail the approaching bus as you would a taxi 
(don’t whistle — just put up your hand). If the sign is white, the bus 
stops automatically. Be sure to check the destination sign on the front 
of the bus to make sure that the bus travels the entire route. If you’re 
paying cash, have some coins with you, because the driver won’t change 
banknotes.
The bus network is divided into two fare zones to simplify cash transac-
tions. Zone 1 covers all Central London, including all the main tourist 
sites. The bus fare for adults is £2 ($3.30). Children 16 and under ride 
free if traveling with an adult with a valid ticket.
 
 To save time and keep buses moving, a large section of Central London 
has been designated a “Pay Before You Board” area. What this means is 
that you can’t board a bus and pay cash for your fare — you must have 
enough credit on your Oyster card or a validated ticket in order to board 
and ride the bus.
 
 Bus passes, available at most Underground stations, selected news agents, 
and the Travel Information Centres, can be used all day but aren’t valid on 
N-prefixed night buses (see the next paragraph). For adults, a one-day bus 
pass for all Central London costs £3.80 ($6.25). Note: Children 15 and 
under ride free if traveling with an adult after 9:30 a.m.
At the witching hour of midnight, buses become night buses (N), and 
their routes change. Nearly all night buses pass through Trafalgar 
Square, Central London’s late-night magnet for insomniacs.
Hailing a taxi
Taking a taxi is a safe and comfortable way to get around the city. Riding 
in the old-fashioned, roomy black taxis is a pleasure. Today, many 
smaller and newer-model taxis also run. London cabs of any size or 
color aren’t cheap, however. Fares change depending on the time of day, 
speed, and distance traveled. Fares and any extra charges are also dis-
played on the meter next to the driver. The basic fare for traveling 1 mile 

Part III: Settling into London 
100
(about 8–12 minutes) in a taxi ranges from £4.60 to £8.40 ($7.60–$14). Tip 
your cabbie 10 percent to 15 percent of the total fare.
You can hail a cab on the street. If a cab is available, the yellow or 
white FOR HIRE sign on the roof is lit. You can order a radio cab by calling 
% 020/7272-0272 or 020/7253-5000. Be aware that if you call for a cab, 
you have to pay an additional £2 ($3.30) service charge.
 
 London is one city where you don’t have to worry about whether the cab 
driver knows where he’s going. When it comes to finding a street address, 
London cabbies are among the most knowledgeable in the world. Their 
rigorous training, which includes an exhaustive street test called “The 
Knowledge,” gives them an encyclopedic grasp of the terrain.
Walking on your own two feet
If you really want to get acquainted with the charming hodgepodge and 
monumental grandeur of London, bring along a good pair of walking 
shoes and explore on foot. Everywhere you turn, you see enticing side 
streets, countrylike lanes, little mews houses (former stables converted 
into homes), and picturesque garden squares. London’s great parks are 
as safe to walk in as its streets. (In fact, crime is less prevalent in London 
than in many other major cities, and all the neighborhoods included in 
this book are safe.)
 
 An 11.25km (7-mile) walk commemorating the life of Princess Diana passes 
through four of London’s royal parks — St. James’s Park, Green Park, 
Hyde Park, and Kensington Gardens. Along the way are 90 plaques that 
point out sites associated with Diana, including Kensington Palace (her 
home for 15 years), Buckingham Palace, St. James’s Palace (where she 
shared an office with Prince Charles), and Spencer House (her family’s 
mansion, now a museum). A good place to start is at Kensington Palace, 
Hyde Park Gate, or Horse Guards Parade (for the Green Park/St. James’s 
section).
 
 When you walk in London (or anywhere in England), remember:
 
✓ If you’re a North American, traffic moves on the opposite side of 
the street from what you’re accustomed to. This sounds simple 
enough on paper, but in practice, you need to keep reminding your-
self to look in the “wrong” direction when crossing a street. 
Throughout London, you see LOOK RIGHT or LOOK LEFT painted on 
street crossings.
 
✓ Pedestrian crossings are marked by striped lines (called zebra 
crossings) on the road. Flashing lights near the curb indicate that 
drivers must stop and yield the right of way when a pedestrian 
steps out into the zebra to cross the street.

Checking In at London’s 
Best Hotels and B&Bs
In This Chapter
▶ Getting the lowdown on London’s accommodations types
▶ Knowing what to expect from a hotel in your price range
▶ Finding the best room for the best rate
▶ Reviewing a list of London favorites
L
ondon hotel rooms run the gamut from a basic tiny bedroom, with a 
shared bathroom down the hall, to elegant, sumptuous suites. Many 
travelers don’t care where they stay, as long as they can stay there 
cheaply. The reasoning is, “I’m only going to be in a hotel room to 
sleep.” That assumption may be true, but I also know that a cheap-at-all-
costs hotel room can color your mood and potentially turn a memorable 
vacation into something unnecessarily dreary.
This chapter is devoted to London hotels and B&Bs. You can find details 
about what to expect for your money, get the lowdown on how to get 
the best rooms at the best rates, and check out a list of specific hotels 
and B&Bs that I heartily recommend.
Getting to Know Your Options
Accommodations in London are available in varying price ranges and 
degrees of luxury. Places to stay generally fit into one of two categories: 
hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns (B&Bs). The following sections pro-
vide a rundown on the quirks and perks of each.
Understanding the pros and cons of B&Bs
B&Bs are small, owner-run hotels with differing degrees of comfort and 
service. Because B&Bs are often private homes (or what were once private 
homes), amenities vary widely, especially in the bathroom facilities. Nearly 
all B&B rooms contain wash basins, but you may have to share a bathroom 
down the hall. The facilities are usually kept scrupulously clean. Keep in 
mind that en-suite (in the room) bathrooms are generally so small that you 

Part III: Settling into London 
102
feel as if you haven’t left the airplane, and the super-small showers can be a 
trial. In terms of décor, B&Bs tend to be fairly basic — everything you need 
but without a lot of fuss or froufrou, and you may not have a telephone in 
your room. On the other hand, the B&B agencies listed in this section offer 
lovely rooms in private homes at half the price of a larger hotel.
Licensed B&Bs, like hotels, are inspected regularly, and the quality of 
London B&Bs has improved tremendously over the years. I recommend 
them for people who don’t require many extras, although the most suc-
cessful B&Bs continually upgrade their services or offer some enticing 
amenities. For example, many B&Bs now provide cable TVs and direct-
dial phones in the rooms. Many travelers prefer B&Bs over large hotels 
because they want friendly service and a personal touch. It’s easier to 
meet people in a small B&B than in a large hotel.
What about the breakfast part of the B&B? Well, gone are the days when 
the staff of every B&B cooked you up a full English breakfast of eggs, sau-
sages, bacon, fried tomatoes, and beans. Some B&Bs still do serve an 
English breakfast, but others put out a continental buffet, which is a 
breakfast of cereals, fruits, and breads. The B&B descriptions in this 
book say either “English breakfast included” or “continental breakfast 
included,” so you know what to expect.
If you want to do some additional B&B research, the following three 
agencies have useful Web sites:
 
✓ London Bed and Breakfast: www.londonbandb.com (% 800/
872-2632 in the U.S., 020/7351-3445 in London)
 
✓ London Bed and Breakfast Agency Ltd.: www.londonbb.com 
(% 020/7586-2768 in London)
 
✓ Uptown Reservations: www.uptownres.co.uk (% 020/7937-2001 
in London)
 
 If you’re physically disabled in any way, B&Bs may not be the choice for 
you. B&Bs usually don’t have elevators, so you may have to carry your 
luggage up steep, narrow stairs. Be sure to check how accessible the B&B 
is before you make your reservations.
Exploring hotel choices
You find a wide choice of hotels in London. Most of the moderately 
priced hotels provide breakfast with a room rental. At a 4- or 5-star 
hotel, you pay a hefty price to eat breakfast on the premises. The rooms 
in a self-catering hotel are equipped with small kitchens, so you can make 
your own meals in your room, if you prefer.
Boutique and deluxe hotels
London offers many boutique hotels. These hotels are midrange in 
size but not price; sumptuously furnished, they offer state-of-the-art 
amenities and full service. I include a few in my reviews later in this 

 Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 103
chapter. The Montague in Bloomsbury and 41 in Victoria and 
Westminster are two of the best.
A more traditional choice is one of London’s older deluxe hotels. The 
Cadogan Hotel in Chelsea, The Gore in South Kensington, and Hazlitt’s 
in Soho have all been around for a century or more. These hotels offer a 
distinctly English kind of style, full of charm and character.
The older deluxe hotels are offset by the hippest of the hip: the St 
Martins Lane, an Ian Schrager concoction in a converted office block.
Chain properties
 Maybe you always stay at one of the chain hotels — a Crowne Plaza, a 
Hyatt, a Radisson, or a Marriott — places that are basically the same no 
matter where they are. Chains rely on their brand name and a no-surprise 
approach to win customers. London is chock-full of chain hotels, if that’s 
what you fancy. Most of them cater to large groups, and you may feel 
rather anonymous in them. On the other hand, these hotels are usually 
well equipped for people with disabilities and families with children.
Landmark hotels
At the top of the hotel spectrum, in both price and prestige, are the land-
mark hotels: Claridge’s, The Dorchester, The Park Lane Hotel, and the 
Savoy (although the Savoy is currently closed for remodeling, so it’s not 
included in this edition). One Aldwych in the West End and The 
Langham on Regent Street are London’s newest landmark hotels. These 
famous hotels are among the best in the world. In each of them, you can 
expect glamorous public salons, a generously proportioned and well-
decorated room with a large private bathroom, an on-site health club or 
access to one nearby, and top-of-the-line service. I review all the preced-
ing hotels later in this chapter.
Self-catering options
 You can also consider staying at a self-catering hotel, where you do the 
cooking in the kitchen in your own hotel room. For short stays and for one 
or two people, self-catering hotels don’t always beat the competition’s 
price. But for families and travelers who can’t afford or don’t want to eat 
every meal out, self-catering hotels can be a budget-saver. For comfort 
and convenience, Astons Apartments in South Kensington is among the 
best, and it’s the only self-catering hotel I include. If you’re interested in 
finding other self-catering options in London, visit the Web site www.
refreshaccommodation.com.
 
 One of the most economical ways to stay in London is to rent a self-catering 
flat (apartment). The owners register their flats with rental agencies; mini-
mum rental time is usually one week. You can find a small studio flat in 
Central London that sleeps two and is fully equipped for under £500 ($825) 
per week. One of the best agencies to help you find a flat is the Independent 
Traveller (% 01392/860-807; www.gowithit.co.uk).

104
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The maximum rate that a hotel charges for a type of room is the rack rate. 
If you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night, the hotel may 
charge you this top rate. Hotel rates, like airline fares, change all the time, 
and it’s impossible to list the most current specials a hotel is offering on its 
Web site. So the rack rate is what I use as a hotel price guide in this book.
 
 Be aware that you don’t have to pay the rack rate — hardly anybody does. 
Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. The result is often favorable 
when savvy travelers make this request. Hotels in London are eager to fill 
their beds (especially during an economic downturn, when fewer tourists 
are coming to London), and most of them are willing to negotiate a room 
rate. Read on for more strategies on getting a good rate.
Finding the best rate
The rate you pay for a room depends on many factors, and the way you 
make your reservation is the most important. The following strategies 
can help you get the best rate available:
 
✓ Call around. If the hotel you’re interested in has a toll-free number, 
call that, but also call the hotel’s local London number. The quoted 
rates can vary so widely that you may save a bundle.
 
✓ Ask about discounts. If you make your reservation with a large 
chain hotel, be sure to mention membership in AARP, frequent-flier 
programs, and any other corporate rewards program. Budget 
hotels and small B&Bs rarely offer these organization discounts, 
but with larger hotels, you never know when the mention may be 
worth a few pounds off your room rate.
 
✓ Travel off-season and on weekends. Room rates change with the 
season and as occupancy rates rise and fall. You’re less likely to 
receive discount rates if a hotel is close to full, but if it’s nearly 
empty, you may be able to negotiate a significant discount. 
Expensive hotels catering to business travelers are most crowded 
on weekdays and usually offer big discounts for weekend stays.
 
 
 You may be able to save 20 percent or more by traveling off-season, 
which is mid-October through mid-December and January through 
March.
 
✓ Choose a package tour. The best rates of all will probably be with an 
air/hotel package (see Chapter 5). With these packages, which are 
sometimes astonishingly cheap, you have to choose a hotel that’s 
part of the package. Airline package hotels tend to be larger chains. 
So what? The money you save may amount to hundreds of dollars 
over what you’d pay by booking the hotel and flight separately.
 
✓ Use a travel agent. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better 
room rate than you could get by yourself. The hotel gives the agent 
a discount in exchange for steering his business toward that hotel.

 Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 105
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Another great source for finding hotel deals is the Internet. Nowadays, 
almost all hotels, even those in the budget range, have Web sites. (I list 
each hotel’s Web site with the other hotel information.) Special promo-
tional offers are often available only on the hotel’s Web site, so it pays to 
do some checking. The room rates in many London hotels fluctuate 
daily, and more and more hotels offer a “best available rate” that can 
reduce the rack rates I quote for my recommended hotels by one-third 
or more. Don’t be afraid to check out the Web prices for luxury hotels 
(identified by $$$$ or $$$$$ in my reviews) — you may be surprised by 
the deals you can find.
You can also use search engines to help you locate a London hotel. 
Although the many travel-booking Web sites (including Expedia, 
Travelocity, Smarter Living, and Yahoo!) offer hotel booking, you may be 
better off using a Web site devoted to lodging because more-general 
sites don’t list all types of properties. Some lodging sites specialize in a 
particular type of accommodations, such as B&Bs, which aren’t on the 
more mainstream booking services. Other services offer weekend deals 
on major chain properties that cater to business travelers and have 
more empty rooms on the weekends.
Some good all-purpose Web sites that you can use to track down and 
make online reservations at hotels in London include the following:
 
✓ All Hotels on the Web (www.all-hotels.com) doesn’t actually 
include all the hotels on the Web, but it does have tens of thou-
sands of listings throughout the world, including London. Bear in 
mind that each hotel in the list has paid a fee ($25 and up) for place-
ment, so the list is not objective, but more like online brochures.
 
✓ British Hotel Reservation Centre (www.bhrc.co.uk) lists current 
and seasonal specials at selected London hotels.
 
✓ HotelDiscount.com (www.hoteldiscount.com) lists bargain 
rates at hotels in U.S. and international cities, including London. If 
you click “London” and input your travel dates, the site provides a 
list of the best prices for a selection of hotels in various 
neighborhoods.
 
✓ The Independent Traveller (www.gowithit.co.uk) lists hun-
dreds of self-catering accommodations in London. These are pri-
vate flats, not hotels, and are available for a one-week minimum 
period; they can be a fantastic bargain.
 
✓ London Bed & Breakfast (www.londonbandb.com) can provide 
inexpensive accommodations in select private homes.
 
✓ London Bed and Breakfast Agency Ltd. (www.londonbb.com) is 
another reliable B&B finder in London.
 
✓ Londontown (www.londontown.com) has a long list of hotels to 
choose from, including some with special offers.

Part III: Settling into London 
106
 
✓ Refresh Accommodation (www.refreshaccommodation.com) 
acts as the booking agent for self-catering flats and hotel rooms 
throughout London and offers all-inclusive (tax-included) prices.
 
✓ Uptown Reservations (www.uptownres.co.uk) provides listings 
for dozens of B&Bs in private homes in London.
Reserving the best room
 
 After you know where you’re staying, asking a few more questions can 
help you land the best possible room. For example:
 
✓ Ask about staying in a corner room. They’re usually larger, qui-
eter, and brighter, but they may cost a bit more.
 
✓ Ask about staying in a room in the back of the building. In 
London, traffic noise can be loud and annoying. In the back, you 
may get a room that overlooks a quiet garden.
 
✓ If your London hotel is a high-rise, request a room on a high 
floor. Being farther away from the street means your room may be 
quieter. Plus, a higher room may give you the added bonus of a 
better view.
 
✓ Ask whether the hotel is renovating. If the answer is yes, request a 
room away from the renovation work, and make sure you ask again 
when you check in.
 
✓ If you have any physical impairments, be sure to ask whether the 
hotel has a lift (elevator). Many small and older hotels in London 
do not have elevators. If the hotel lacks a lift, ask whether a ground-
floor (first-floor) room is available.
 
✓ Inquire about the location of restaurants, bars, and meeting facil-
ities, which can be noisy.
 
✓ If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, return to 
the front desk right away. If another room is available, the staff 
should be able to accommodate you, within reason.
Arriving without a Reservation
Whatever your hotel choice in London, I want to remind you again: 
Booking ahead is a good idea. Why waste precious vacation time search-
ing for a hotel? If you do arrive without a reservation, your first option is 
to start calling the hotels directly. Keep in mind that smaller B&Bs may 
not accept reservations late in the evening. You can also book rooms 
through the trustworthy agencies in the following list, but the first one 
doesn’t have phone service, so you have to show up in person.

 Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 107
 
✓ The Britain & London Visitor Centre, 1 Lower Regent St., SW1Y 
4XT (Tube: Piccadilly Circus), is open Monday 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., 
Tuesday through Friday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (June–Sept Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m.). 
You have to show up in person to get help reserving a room.
 
✓ British Hotel Reservation Centre (% 020/7340-1616; www.bhrc.
co.uk) offers a 24-hour phone line. The center provides free reser-
vations and discounted rates at all the leading hotel groups and the 
major independents. This agency operates a reservations desk (daily 
6 a.m.–midnight) at the Underground station of Heathrow Airport.
 
✓ First Option Hotel Reservations (% 020/7808-3861) is another 
hotel booking service. This agency operates kiosks at the following 
Central London rail stations: Charing Cross (% 020/7976-1171); 
Euston (% 020/7388-7435); Kings Cross, by Platform 8 (% 020/
7837-5681); Paddington (% 020/7723-0184); and Victoria, by 
Platform 9 (% 020/7828-4646).
London’s Top Hotels
Every recommended hotel in this chapter has a $ symbol to help you 
hone in on your price limit. These symbols reflect a hotel’s high- and 
low-end rack rates for a double room. Table 9-1 shows what you can 
expect in terms of accommodations type, room size, and standard ame-
nities in the five price categories. Keep in mind, however, that the 
London hotel scene has become highly competitive, in the face of cur-
rent economic realities, and hotels that were once exorbitantly priced 
may now offer deals that compare with midrange hotels.

Price Range
What to Expect
$
£100 ($165) 
and under
These accommodations are relatively simple 
and more likely to be found in B&Bs than hotels. 
Rooms will likely be small; and in-room ameni-
ties, such as a telephone and televisions, are 
not necessarily provided. You may have to share 
a bathroom. In a B&B, you’ll get breakfast.
$$
£101–£150 
($167–$248)
A bit classier, these midrange accommodations 
offer more room, more extras (such as an iron, a 
hair dryer, or a microwave), and a more conve-
nient location than the preceding category. You 
probably get breakfast.

Dollar Sign(s)
Price Range
What to Expect
$$$
£151–£200 
($249–$330)
Higher-class still, these accommodations begin 
to look more upscale, and service begins to 
factor in. Many chain hotels are in this category. 
You’ll have a roomier private bathroom, cable 
TV, and other in-room amenities, and there will 
probably be a cafe or restaurant on the prem-
ises. You may or may not get breakfast.
$$$$
£201–£250 
($331–$413)
Hotels in this category will generally meet high 
international standards and be located in 
upscale neighborhoods. Porter and room ser-
vice will be available. Think fine furnishings, 
larger bathrooms with designer toiletries, high-
quality bedding, chocolates on pillows, a classy 
restaurant, and a knowledgeable concierge. 
There will be a fine breakfast available, but 
you’ll probably have to pay for it.
$$$$$
£251 ($414) 
and up
These top-rated accommodations generally 
come with luxury amenities, such as valet park-
ing, 24-hour room service, a gourmet restaurant, 
on-site spa and health club, large bathrooms, 
high-end furnishings and high-quality sheets, 
DVD/CD players, turn-down service — it’s all 
great, and you pay through the nose for it. 
Breakfast will be available but not included in 
the price. The great London “name” hotels fall 
into this category.
 
 Sorry, you can’t escape that annoying 17.5 percent value-added tax 
(VAT). In general, the quoted room rate includes the VAT (except for 
rooms at the upper end of the price scale). Be sure to ask, though, so you 
won’t get an unpleasant surprise when you’re checking out. Unless I note 
otherwise, the VAT is included in the rates for my recommended hotels.
 The Abbey Court
$$  Notting Hill
This small, graceful hotel, with a flower-filled front patio and a rear con-
servatory where breakfast is served, is located in a renovated mid-Victo-
rian town house near Kensington Gardens. The 22 charming guest rooms 
feature 18th- and 19th-century country antiques and marble bathrooms 
equipped with Jacuzzi tubs, showers, and heated towel racks. You can 
enjoy 24-hour room service and take advantage of the services of the con-
cierge, who can help arrange for babysitting.

walk north on Pembridge Gardens Road). Rack rates: £110–£140 ($182–$231) double.

 Aster House
$$$–$$$$  South Kensington
Found at the end of an early Victorian terrace, this beautifully renovated 
charmer is a former two-time winner of the London Tourism Bed and 
Breakfast of the Year Award. Each of the 12 guest rooms is individually 
decorated in English country-house style, some with four-poster, half-
canopied beds and silk wallpaper. The new bathrooms come with power 
showers. The breakfasts, served in the glassed-in garden conservatory, 
are more health-conscious than those served in most English B&Bs.
See map p. 118. 3 Sumner Place (near Onslow Square), SW7 3EE. % 020/7581-5888. 
Fax: 020/7584-4925. www.asterhouse.com. Tube: South Kensington (then a

 Astons Apartments
$$  South Kensington
In three carefully restored Victorian redbrick town houses, Astons offers 
value-packed self-catering accommodations, some ideal for families. Each 
studio has a compact kitchenette; a small bathroom; and bright, func-
tional furnishings. The more expensive executive studios feature larger 
bathrooms, more living space, and extra pizzazz in the décor. If you like 
the idea of having your own cozy London apartment (with daily maid ser-
vice), you can’t do better. Cots and cribs are available for kids.
See map p. 118. 31 Rosary Gardens (off Hereford Square), SW7 4NQ. % 800/525-2810 
in the U.S., or 020/7590-6000. Fax: 020/7590-6060. www.astons-apartments.

£111 ($173–$183) double. Rates don’t include 17.5 percent VAT. AE, MC, V.
 
 Avonmore Hotel
$  Kensington
This small hotel is in a quiet neighborhood easily accessible to West End 
theaters and shops. You’d be hard-pressed to find more for your money: 
Each of the nine guest rooms offers a tasteful décor and an array of ameni-
ties not usually found in this price range. A few years ago, this establish-
ment was voted London’s best private hotel by the Automobile Association 
(AA), and the high standards that earned that honor are still maintained. 
An English breakfast is served in a cheerful breakfast room; a bar and 
limited room service are also available, and the hotel can arrange for 
babysitting.

can relax and get fresh tea and coffee 24/7. Breakfast is either continental

 Cadogan Hotel
$$$–$$$$$  Chelsea
You feel transported back to the Victorian era at this beautiful 69-room 
hotel, with a small wood-paneled lobby and sumptuous drawing room 
(good for afternoon tea), close to all the exclusive Knightsbridge shops. 
The Cadogan (pronounced cah-dug-en) is the hotel where poet, play-
wright, and novelist Oscar Wilde was staying when he was arrested (Room 
118 is the Oscar Wilde Room). The large guest rooms, many overlooking 
the Cadogan Place gardens, are quietly tasteful and splendidly comfort-
able, with large bathrooms. The sedate Edwardian restaurant is known for 
its excellent cuisine.

Square (then a 5-minute walk north on Sloane Street). Rack rates: £190–£395 ($314–
$652) double. Rates don’t include 17.5 percent VAT. AE, MC, V.
 Cartref House
$  Westminster and Victoria
Cartref House is among the top budget B&Bs in London. Each guest room 
is individually designed and comfortably furnished; some of the larger 
ones contain bunk beds, which makes them suitable for families. All have 
small private bathrooms. The English breakfast is hearty (but ends at 8:30 
a.m.), and the place is remarkably well kept. There’s no elevator, but 
guests don’t seem to mind. Friendly, personal service makes this a winner.

 Covent Garden Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$  Covent Garden
Created from an 1850s French hospital and dispensary, this boutique 
hotel surrounds guests in luxury. No 2 of the 50 guest rooms are alike. 
Many rooms have large windows with rooftop views. The décor is a lush 
mix of antiques and fine contemporary furniture, and the granite-tiled 
bathrooms with glass-walled showers and heated towel racks are among 
the best in London. The wood-paneled public rooms are just as impres-
sive. On-site Brasserie Max serves up eclectic bistro food and is a chic 
place to lunch. If you don’t get enough exercise touring London, you can 
keep in shape at the small gym on the premises.

 Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 117
 The Cranley
$$$–$$$$  South Kensington
On a quiet street near South Kensington’s museums, The Cranley occu-
pies a quartet of restored 1875 town houses. Luxuriously appointed public 
rooms and 39 high-ceilinged, air-conditioned guest rooms — with original 
plasterwork, a blend of Victorian and contemporary furnishings, and up-
to-the-minute, in-room technology — make this property a standout. The 
bathrooms are large and nicely finished, with tubs and showers. Rates 
include tea with scones in the afternoon and champagne and canapés in 
the evening.

AE, DC, MC, V.
Dorset Square Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$  Marylebone
This sophisticated, 38-room, luxury boutique hotel occupies a beautifully 
restored Regency town house overlooking Dorset Square, a private garden 
surrounded by graceful buildings. Inside and out, this hotel is the epitome 
of traditional English style. Each guest room is unique, filled with a super-
lative mix of antiques, original oils, fine furniture, fresh flowers, and richly 
textured fabrics. The bathrooms are marble and mahogany. (Just remem-
ber that some of those enticing little toiletries aren’t free.)

Durrants Hotel
$$$$  Marylebone
Opened in 1789, off Manchester Square, this 92-room hotel provides an 
atmospheric London retreat. The pine-and-mahogany-paneled public 
areas, including an 18th-century letter-writing room and a wonderful 
Georgian room that serves as a restaurant, are quintessentially English. 
The guest rooms are generously proportioned (for the most part) and 
nicely furnished, with decent-size bathrooms.

 Fairways Hotel
$  Paddington
This large, late-Georgian house from the 1820s is a real bargain. Stephen 
Adams, who took over the management from his parents (they ran the 
hotel for 25 years), made several improvements in 2002, laying new car-
peting and redoing all the shared toilets and showers. All 17 rooms are 
different, the ones in back much quieter. Some of the private bathrooms 
are much smaller than others. Coffeemakers and hair dryers are in the 
rooms, but the phone is in the hallway and, to keep prices low, breakfast 
is not included in the room rate.
See map p. 122. 186 Sussex Gardens, W2 1TU. % 020/7723-4871. Fax: 020/7723-4871. 
www.fairways-hotel.co.uk. Tube: Paddington (then a 5-minute walk). Rack 
rates: £60 ($99) double without bathroom, £70 ($116) double with bathroom. AE, DC, 
MC, V.
The Fielding Hotel
$$–$$$  Covent Garden
Named for author Henry Fielding (famous for The History of Tom Jones), 
The Fielding is on a beautiful, old street (now pedestrian-only), lit by 19th-
century gaslights and across from the Royal Opera House. The stairways 
are steep and narrow (the hotel has no elevator), and the 24 rather 
cramped guest rooms are undistinguished in décor, but they do have 
showers and toilets. Those quibbles aside, this quirky hotel is an excellent 
value. A small bar is on the premises, and the area is loaded with cafes, 
restaurants, and fabulous shopping.

($190–$281) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
 
 41
$$$$–$$$$$  Westminster and Victoria
Overlooking Buckingham Palace Mews, this unique, 18-room boutique 
hotel is the epitome of luxury and offers superior personal service. The 
hotel lobby and breakfast room is an elegant conservatory that was once 
the waiting room for debutantes who were going to Buckingham Palace to 
be presented. Every detail in the beautifully furnished rooms, from the 
Frette sheets to the Penhaligon toiletries, is pure luxe. The staff here is 
wonderfully friendly.

 The Gallery
$$$  South Kensington
This relatively unknown 36-room hotel, located near the cultural and retail 
attractions in South Kensington and Knightsbridge, occupies two com-
pletely restored and converted Georgian residences. The elegant guest 
rooms are individually designed and include half-canopied beds and mar-
ble-tiled bathrooms. The lounge, with its rich mahogany paneling and 
moldings and deep colors, has the ambience of a private club. The overall 
décor is wonderfully Victorian, but every modern convenience is avail-
able, including Wi-Fi. Two of the suites have their own roof terraces.

Gate Hotel
$  Notting Hill
This tiny, three-story building dates from the 1820s (when people were 
evidently much smaller), so the six color-coordinated guest rooms are 
cramped but atmospheric, and the stairs are steep. The Gate is one of only 
two hotels along the length of Portobello Road, famous for its antiques 
shops and Saturday bric-a-brac stalls. Kensington Gardens is a five-minute 
walk away.

 The Gore
$$$$$  South Kensington
If you dream of the days of Queen Victoria, you’ll definitely appreciate the 
Victorian-era charm of The Gore, which has been in more or less continu-
ous operation since 1892. On a busy road near Kensington Gardens and 
the Royal Albert Hall, The Gore is loaded with historic charm: walnut-and-
mahogany paneling, oriental rugs, and 19th-century prints. Each of the 54 
guest rooms is unique, filled with high-quality antiques and elegant fur-
nishings, including old commodes that conceal the toilets.

Grange Strathmore Hotel
$$–$$$  South Kensington
Formerly the residence of the 14th earl of Strathmore, the late Queen 
Mum’s father, this hotel overlooks a private garden square just minutes 
from the South Ken museums. Some of the guest rooms feature a high-
ceilinged spaciousness, which is rare in London hotels, and bathrooms 
with tubs and showers. Plenty of hand-carved rosewood furniture and 
well-chosen fabrics decorate the rooms. One drawback is that, on week-
ends, no general manager is on duty; also, service can sometimes be 
rather impersonal.
See map p. 118. 41 Queen’s Gate Gardens (at the southeast corner of the Gardens), 
SW7 5NB. % 020/7584-0512. Fax: 020/7584-0246. www.grangehotels.com. 
Tube: Gloucester Road (then a 2-minute walk north on Gloucester Road and east on 
Queen’s Gate Gardens). Rack rates: £125–£200 ($206–$330) double. AE, MC, V.
 Harlingford
$$  Bloomsbury
In the heart of Bloomsbury, this wonderfully personable and immaculately 
maintained hotel occupies three 1820s town houses joined by an array of 
staircases (no elevators) and hallways. The 44 guest rooms are pleasantly 
comfy, some graced with floral prints and double-glazed windows to cut 
down on noise; the best rooms are on the second and third levels. The 
bathrooms are very small, however. The hotel has family rooms and can 
provide cots for children. Guests have use of the tennis courts in 
Cartwright Gardens.
See map p. 115. 61–63 Cartwright Gardens (north of Russell Square), WC1H 9EL. 
% 020/7387-1551. Fax: 020/7387-4616. www.harlingfordhotel.com. Tube: 
Russell Square (then a 10-minute walk northwest on Woburn Place, east on Tavistock 
Square, and north on Marchmont Street). Rack rates: £110 ($181) double. English 
breakfast included. AE, DC, MC, V.
 Hart House Hotel
$$  Marylebone
A Georgian town house, built in 1782 and used by members of the French 
nobility during the French Revolution, Hart House is one of the most wel-
coming and professionally run B&Bs in London. It has retained its digni-
fied entrance hall and polished paneling. The 16 rooms (all nonsmoking) 
are attractive and comfortable with small but immaculate bathrooms. 
Double-glazing on the windows screens out the traffic roar on Gloucester 
Place. Some very large rooms, perfect for families, have big bathtubs and 
showers, and the staff can help you arrange babysitting.
See map p. 122. 51 Gloucester Place, Portman Square (just north of Marble Arch), 
W1U 8JF. % 020/7935-2288. Fax: 020/7935-8516. www.harthouse.co.uk. Tube: 
Marble Arch (then a 5-minute walk north on Gloucester Place). Rack rates: £125 
($206) double. English breakfast included. AE, MC, V.

Hazlitt’s
$$$$–$$$$$  Soho
Built in 1718, this intimate, 23-room gem offers old-fashioned atmosphere 
and a hip Soho location. Recent restoration exposed original wood panel-
ing and other features that were hidden for years, but the hotel still lacks 
an elevator. The charming Georgian-era guest rooms feature mahogany 
and pine furnishings and antiques, as well as lovely bathrooms, many with 
claw-foot tubs. The back rooms are quieter; the front rooms are lighter, 
but without the quieting effect of double-glazed windows, you do hear the 
street noise.
See map p. 115. 6 Frith St., Soho Square (just west of Charing Cross Road), W1D 3JA. 
% 020/7434-1771. Fax: 020/7439-1524. www.hazlitts.co.uk. Tube: Tottenham 
Court Road (then a 10-minute walk west on Oxford Street, and then south on Soho 
Street to Frith Street at the south end of Soho Square). Rack rates: £220–£360 ($363–
$594) double. Rates don’t include 17.5 percent VAT. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel La Place
$$  Marylebone
This desirable hotel, north of Oxford Street, caters to women traveling 
alone. The interior has been upgraded to boutique-hotel standards 
(although the exterior isn’t especially impressive); the 21 moderate-size 
guest rooms are done in classic English style, with mahogany furnishings, 
brocades, TV armoires, and writing desks; you also find air-conditioning 
and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are as nice as the rooms. The hotel’s Jardin 
is a chic, intimate wine bar/restaurant.
See map p. 115. 17 Nottingham Place (near the southwest corner of Regent’s Park), 
W1M 3FF. % 020/7486-2323. Fax: 020/7486-4335. www.hotellaplace.com. 
Tube: Baker Street (then a 5-minute walk east on Marylebone Road and south on 
Nottingham Place). Rack rates: £120–£149 ($198–$246) double. English breakfast 
included. AE, DC, MC, V.
 
 Hotel 167
$–$$  South Kensington
Hotel 167 attracts hip, young visitors with its price, and business people 
with its central location (and the price doesn’t hurt either). This hotel is 
bright and attractive, offering 16 comfortable guest rooms, each with a 
decent-size bathroom (some with showers, others with tubs). The rooms 
are furnished with a mix of fabrics and styles. Nearby Tube stations make 
the hotel convenient to the rest of London, and the busy neighborhood 
itself is fun to explore.
See map p. 118. 167 Old Brompton Rd., SW5 OAN. % 020/7373-0672. Fax: 020/7373-
3360. Tube: South Kensington (then a 10-minute walk west on Old Brompton Road). 
Rack rates: £99–£110 ($163–$181) double. Continental breakfast included. AE, 
DC, MC, V.

Part III: Settling into London 
126
 
 The Hoxton
$–$$$  Shoreditch
This trendsetting “Urban Lodge” opened in 2007 and offers something 
quite unique for London: chic style at a cheap price. In fact, check its Web 
site; The Hoxton periodically holds incredible sales, and you may be able 
to nab a room for an amazingly cheap rate. The rooms are comfortable, 
well-designed, and refreshingly free of froufrou. The beautifully tiled, 
shower-only bathrooms have every hotel in this price range beat by a 
mile. A simple bagged breakfast arrives at your room every morning, food 
and wine are sold in the lobby at supermarket prices, high-speed comput-
ers are on hand for the guests, and phone calls are incredibly cheap. In 
short, you’ll find great value and no rip-offs. The trendy Shoreditch area 
is considered part of the East End of London.
See map p. 115. 81 Great Eastern St., EC2A 3HU. % 020/7550-1000. Fax: 020/7550-
1090. www.hoxtonhotels.com. Tube: Old Street (then a 5-minute walk north on 
Old Street, then turn right down Great Eastern Street). Rack rates: £59–£199 ($97–
$328) double. Rates include continental breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Imperial
$$  Bloomsbury
The décor is dated and the exterior epitomizes the worst of 1960s archi-
tecture, but so what? The 448-room Imperial is a full-service hotel and a 
terrific value. Nine floors are guest rooms; the third floor is entirely non-
smoking. The hotel does plenty of tour-group business, but the rooms 
have stood up well to the traffic. They’re all a decent size, with unusual 
triangular-shaped bay windows, good storage space, and workable bath-
rooms. Amenities include a restaurant, a late-hour Internet cafe, con-
cierge, and room service.
See map p. 115. Russell Square, WC1B 5BB. % 020/7278-7871. Fax: 020/7837-4653. 
www.imperialhotels.co.uk. Tube: Russell Square (the hotel is on the east 
side of the square). Rack rates: £105–£125 ($173–$206) double. English breakfast 
included. AE, DC, MC, V.
 
 The Jenkins Hotel
$  Bloomsbury
This nonsmoking hotel offers a bit of Georgian charm; a great location 
near the British Museum and West End theaters; a nice, comfortable atmo-
sphere; a full breakfast; and a low price. The 15 guest rooms are small, but 
all have private bathrooms. You don’t find reception or sitting rooms, or 
even an elevator, but you can still settle in and feel at home. Although the 
hotel has no special facilities for kids, it welcomes children.
See map p. 115. 45 Cartwright Gardens (just south of Euston Station), WC1H 9EH. 
% 020/7387-2067. Fax: 020/7383-3139. www.jenkinshotel.demon.co.uk. 
Tube: Euston Station (then a 5-minute walk east on Euston Road and south on 
Mabledon Place to the south end of Cartwright Gardens). Rack rates: £95 ($157) 
double. English breakfast included. MC, V.

 Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 127
Knightsbridge Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$  Knightsbridge
Small and elegant, with only 44 rooms, the Knightsbridge Hotel is located 
on a quiet, tree-lined street just minutes from Harrods and all the heavy-
duty shopping possibilities of Knightsbridge; the Victoria and Albert 
Museum and Hyde Park are also within easy walking distance. The rooms 
here are decorated in a smart, contemporary English style with comfort-
able-sized bathrooms. There are two comfy lounge areas downstairs and 
lots of style all around.
See map p. 118. 10 Beaufort Gardens, SW3 1PT. % 888/559-5508 in U.S. and Canada 
or 020/7584-6300. Fax: 020/7584-6355. www.knightsbridgehotel.com. Tube: 
Knightsbridge (then a 5-minute walk west on Brompton Road and southeast on 
Beaufort Gardens). Rack rates: £210–£295 ($346–$487) double. AE, MC, V.
K West Hotel & Spa
$–$$  Shepherd’s Bush
This hotel, created from a former BBC office building, is located within 
easy walking distance of the huge new Westfield London shopping center 
(the largest inner-city shopping mall in Europe) and the Earl’s Court and 
Olympia convention centers; by Tube it’s about 15 minutes from the West 
End. The rooms are larger than average for London, furnished in a crisp, 
modern style, and have good-size bathrooms with tub/shower combina-
tions. The ambience throughout is relaxed and friendly, and there’s a full-
service spa that features all kinds of soothing treatments. Check the Web 
site for special rates that can make this slightly-out-the-way hotel a real 
bargain; some of the rates include a full English breakfast.
See map p. 122. Richmond Way, W14 OAX. % 020/8008-6650. Fax: 020/8008-6650. 
www.k-west.co.uk. Tube: Shepherd’s Bush (then a 5-minute walk south across 
Shepherd’s Bush Green street, left on the pedestrian path to Richmond Way, and 
south 2 blocks). Rack rates: £90–£150 ($149–$248) double. AE, MC, V.
 
 Lancaster London
$–$$$$$  Bayswater
I happen to like big old hotels that keep themselves in good condition and 
retain a sense of friendly courtesy. Lancaster London has been around for 
ages, and it has a loyal clientele. The hotel sits directly across from Hyde 
Park, and the airy city and park views from the upper floors are among the 
best in London. The rooms are decorated with a modern flair and have 
marble bathrooms, air-conditioning, and double-glazed windows to cut 
down on the traffic noise. You can usually find a room in every price 
range, but go for the higher floors, with a park view, if you can.
Lancaster Terrace, W2 2TY. % 020/7262-6737. Fax: 020/7724-3191. www.lancaster
london.com. Tube: Lancaster Gate (the hotel is across from the station). Rack 
rates: £95–£265 ($157–$437) double. AE, MC, V.

128
 The Landmark London
$$$$$  Marylebone
The finest Victorian railway hotel in England when it opened in 1899, The 
Landmark was recently restored to its former glory. The hotel sits in a 
great location, particularly if you’re with kids, because Madame Tussauds 
wax museum and Regents Park are only around the corner. Built around 
an eight-story atrium, the 299 rooms are among London’s largest and fea-
ture marble bathrooms. The hotel offers every amenity, including babysit-
ting, a large health club, and an indoor pool. When you book at this hotel 
you’ll generally get a much lower rate than the one listed here.
See map p. 122. 222 Marylebone Rd. (1⁄2 block from Madame Tussauds), NW1 6JQ. 
% 800/323-7500 in the U.S. or 020/7631-8000. Fax: 020/7631-8080. www.landmark

The Langham
$$$$$  Marylebone
A fabulous location at the head of Regent Street, ultra-comfy rooms, and 
superlative service make this newly refurbished grand hotel one of 
London’s grandest places to stay. Guest rooms are stylish and quietly 
sumptuous, with good-size bathrooms and luxury amenities. For an extra 
charge, you can get a room in the “Club” section, which includes breakfast 
and evening canapés. Artesian, right off the main lobby, is the hotel’s glam 
cocktail bar. There’s a wonderful gym, a big indoor pool, and a full-service 
spa. Book online and pay far less than the published rack rate for a room.

Lime Tree Hotel
$$  Westminster and Victoria
This attractive, brick-fronted town house is located near Buckingham 
Palace, Westminster Abbey, and the Houses of Parliament. It’s nicely fur-
nished, with deep cornices in the hall and statues and flowers in the 
alcoves up the stairs. The more expensive of the 26 rooms are quite luxuri-
ous, with swagged curtains, canopied beds, and pretty furniture; others 
are more simply furnished, but all are generally larger and have more 
amenities than you usually find in this price range. The bathrooms are 
small. The front rooms have small balconies overlooking Ebury Street; the 
rear rooms are quieter and look out over a small garden.

London Bridge Hotel
$$–$$$$  Southwark
Quietly elegant and independently owned, the London Bridge Hotel occu-
pies a prime South Bank location close to the famous bridge and all the 
South Bank attractions; just across the Thames is the Tower of London,

 London Vicarage Hotel
$–$$  Kensington
The family-run London Vicarage offers old-world English charm, hospital-
ity, and a good value. The hotel is on a residential garden square close to 
High Street Kensington and Kensington Palace. The 18 guest rooms, indi-
vidually furnished in Victorian style, can accommodate up to four; Room 
19 on the top floor is particularly charming. Some of the double and twin 
rooms have small bathrooms. The hotel welcomes children and will 
arrange for babysitting; however, it isn’t really equipped to deal with the 
needs of the under-3 set. Many guests return here year after year.

 Luna Simone Hotel
$–$$  Westminster and Victoria
The outside of this big, stuccoed, family-run hotel gleams bright white, 
and all the guest rooms have been freshly renovated with private 
bathrooms installed. The 36 rooms vary widely in size, but with 
their pleasant décor and newly tiled bathrooms (all with showers), they 
beat all the dowdy, badly designed hotels and B&Bs for miles around. 
The reception area and smart-looking breakfast room (now totally non-
smoking) are also new. The look throughout is refreshingly light, simple, 
and modern.

The Marylebone Hotel
$$–$$$  Marylebone
This contemporary hotel in the heart of Marylebone offers appealing 
rooms in a lively, intriguing, upscale neighborhood loaded with shops and 
restaurants. The hotel is stylish without being flashy, and many of its 
rooms have views looking out into quiet side streets or over the rooftops. 
The décor is low-key chic; the bathrooms are small but better than many 
in this price range. A full breakfast is included in some of the room rates.

The Milestone Hotel
$$$$$  South Kensington
Service is what sets The Milestone apart from most of its high-toned, high-
priced competitors. There’s a butler on duty round-the-clock and two staff 
people for every guest. Add to that an unbeatable location right across 
from Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace, and close to great 
Kensington High Street shopping and restaurants, and you can’t go wrong.

nities, including free Wi-Fi or wired Internet and iPod docking stations.

18 rooms are decorated with a mix of traditional styles and contain cof-
feemakers and hair dryers. The quieter rooms at the back look over a

 Mitre House Hotel
$  Paddington
This fine, midsize hotel near Paddington Station stretches across four 
Georgian town houses and is kept in tiptop shape. The assortment of 
accommodations makes it great for families: two-bedroom family suites 
come with private bathrooms, and superior family suites that face quiet, 
leafy Talbot Square have toilets and tubs/shower combinations off private 
corridors. All 69 rooms are above-average size for London; those at the 
back are quieter, though the view north across back alleys to Paddington 
isn’t very inspiring. A pleasant lounge and bar, and even an elevator, are 
on-site.

For service and sheer sumptuousness, you won’t find a better hotel any-
where in the vicinity of the British Museum — which happens to be right 
across the street from The Montague. Every room in this immaculately 
kept property has been individually decorated and features every amenity 
you can think of, from twice-daily maid service with evening turndown to 
luxuriously equipped bathrooms. The airy garden-side conservatory is a

myhotel Chelsea
$$–$$$$  Chelsea
Created from a five-story former police station, this is what you might call 
a “concept” hotel. The concept is feng shui, a Chinese design philosophy 
that emphasizes the control and direction of chi, or energy. You won’t find 
any hard, sharp-angled edges in any of the 44 guest rooms, for instance. 
What you will find is a playful, contemporary aesthetic that mixes comfort 
and style. The rooms are fairly generous in size, with nice bathrooms 
(showers only in standard rooms). The area is fun to explore and full of 
shops and restaurants.

appointed B&B in four early-Victorian town houses. The 40 guest rooms 
feature an eclectic mix of English antiques and modern paintings, and the 
bathrooms are large by London standards. The rooms look out over the 
private gardens of Sumner Place. On chilly days, you find a fire crackling 
in the drawing-room fireplace. Breakfast is served in the rooms, but if the 
weather’s fine, you can have it in the garden and enjoy the fish pond and 
the bubbling fountain.

The 105 rooms are fitted out with the latest in cutting-edge technology and

Sometimes called the “Iron Lady of Piccadilly” because it’s so well built, 
this landmark hotel opened in 1927. Executive rooms and suites are deco-

marble bathrooms. The price goes up according to location (particularly

This hotel occupies six refitted Victorian terrace houses. A Chippendale 
fireplace graces the lobby, and five Empire chandeliers suspended verti-
cally, one on top of the other, hang in one of the stairwells. The 210 
modern guest rooms are subdued and attractive, with good-size bath-
rooms. The one downside is that the air-conditioning system on the west 
side of the building can be pretty loud on hot summer nights. Guests can 
use the health club, with steam rooms and saunas.

The personable owner of the Rhodes recently spruced up the entire hotel, 
adding hand-painted, Greek-inspired murals to the public areas. Other

Dining and Snacking 
in London
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering what’s new and what’s hot
▶ Locating the best dining neighborhoods
▶ Reviewing my favorite restaurants in London
▶ Listing restaurants by neighborhood, cuisine, and price
L
ondon’s dining scene now offers a vast array of culinary choices; 
over 5,000 restaurants prepare the cuisines of more than 60 
countries. But you can still find traditional English dishes in London: 
Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips, or bangers and mash (sausages 
and mashed potatoes). So if you want to sample the old cuisine, you 
won’t be disappointed. This chapter explains what you need to know 
about new trends; traditional, modern, and ethnic cuisines; spots 
favored by locals; and finding a bargain. I list my favorite London 
dining spots, too.
For a glossary of English food terms, refer to the Cheat Sheet found at 
www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/london.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
London is now considered one of the food capitals of the world, and its 
restaurant scene is a volatile one — made even more so by the recent 
economic downturn, which has forced some restaurants to close their 
doors. To be trendy and talked about, a London restaurant must have a 
celebrity owner, a celebrity chef, a solid reputation, a great view, a chic 
location, and/or an unmistakable ambience — and, of course, memora-
ble food helps, too. But now (again, because of the economy) there’s a 
new trend toward less expensive ethnic foods and restaurants that don’t 
charge exorbitant prices. Many restaurants have responded by lowering 
their prices and offering fixed-price meals. The other new trend that’s 
taken hold is the use of local, seasonal produce.

 Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 141
Multicultural London is always in the midst of culinary evolution. The 
local food horizon expanded as the postwar generation began to travel 
and experience new cuisines outside England, and as “exotic” foods and 
spices became more readily available in the English markets. There’s a 
big interest in fusion food, too: mixing and matching the foods, spices, 
and cooking techniques of different countries.
But even with all the foodie fuss about fusion and new cuisines, “plain 
English cooking” —hearty, old-fashioned, and sometimes considered 
dull — is still available in London, and the style is enjoying renewed 
interest and respect. The best traditional dishes — game, lamb, meat 
and fish pies, and roast beef with Yorkshire pudding — are readily avail-
able. Modern British cuisine takes old standards and deliciously rein-
vents them with foreign influences and ingredients, mostly from France 
(sauces), the Mediterranean (olive oil, oregano, and garlic), and north-
ern Italy (pasta, polenta, and risotto). Besides Modern British, London 
foodies continue to favor classic French and Italian cuisines. (For more 
on English cooking, see Chapter 2.)
Indian cooking has been a favorite ethnic food for some time. In fact, 
curry is now considered a “national” dish. London is filled with Indian 
restaurants serving curries and dishes cooked in clay tandoori pots. 
Balti, a thick curry from Pakistan, is one of the more recent ethnic must-
try dishes in London. Other new influences making their way into 
Modern British cooking come from Thailand and Morocco.
If you want to dine in a restaurant, reserving a table is always a good 
idea. At all but the smartest London restaurants, you can usually get a 
table on fairly short notice during the week, especially if you’re willing to 
dine before 7 p.m. or after 9 p.m.
With the passage of the nonsmoking ordinances of 2007, you can be 
assured that your meal in any London restaurant or pub will be 
smoke-free.
Discovering the top dining areas
London offers a mouth-watering mix of restaurants; you can enjoy a 
wide variety of foods throughout the city. Soho and neighboring Covent 
Garden offer the most choices in the West End, with African, British, 
Caribbean, Eastern European, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Middle 
Eastern, modern European, Mongolian, North American, South 
American, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, and vegetarian all represented. South 
Kensington makes up another eclectic grab bag of culinary choices.
Unlike some other large cities, ethnic restaurants aren’t grouped 
together within specific areas of Central London. However, several 
Chinese restaurants are clustered along Lisle, Wardour, and Gerrard 
streets in Soho’s Chinatown. And Notting Hill has long been a standby 
for low-price Indian and Caribbean restaurants.

142
Eating with the locals
Londoners, like the residents in any large city, have their favorite neigh-
borhood eateries. Pubs, wine bars, and cafes are places where locals go 
for casual meals that aren’t as expensive as restaurants.
Ordering up pub grub
 
 If you’re not into ethnic dining, then pubs are your best bet for getting a 
good meal for a low price. Until fairly recently, pub food was generally 
traditional and down to earth: meat pies and mash (mashed potatoes), 
fish and chips, mixed grills (sausages and a chop or cutlet), salads, sand-
wiches, and the famous ploughman’s lunch (bread and cheese, or pâté). 
But lately, a multiethnic variety of current food faves has changed the 
cooking in many a pub kitchen, and you’re now just as likely to encounter 
curries and kebabs as fish and chips. Pub food may be prepackaged and 
frozen and then microwaved. However, more and more pubs resemble 
casual restaurants. A new genre of pub restaurants exists called gastro-
pubs, where the cooking is fresher, more adventurous, and better pre-
pared than at traditional pubs.
Pubs are drop-in places, and finding a table at lunchtime isn’t always 
easy. Pubs don’t accept reservations. Usually, you order your food from 
the serving counter and your drinks from the bar, and then seat your-
self. Sometimes you get table service. Pub grub is generally washed 
down with beer, the British national drink. Draught beer in Britain is 
served at room temperature, as are most soft drinks. Bottled imported 
beer, served cold, is generally available but more expensive.
 
 Unless a pub has a special children’s certificate, kids 13 and under are 
allowed only into the gardens and separate family rooms. The legal drink-
ing age in the United Kingdom is 18, although restaurants can serve beer 
or cider to kids 16 and over who order a meal.
Wining and dining at wine bars
Londoners may love to knock back a pint of beer at their local pub, but 
when it comes to restaurant dining, wine is the favored accompaniment. 
You can get wine in a pub, but the choices will be limited. Wine bars, on 
the other hand, are dedicated to good food and good grape, most of it 
imported from France, Australia, and South America. Wine bars are 
more upscale than pubs. Like pubs, wine bars don’t permit children 13 
and under, except when seated in gardens or family rooms. Be aware 
that a meal in a wine bar costs more than a similar meal in a pub.
Kicking back at cafes
London’s cafes generally serve light, inexpensive food and offer limited 
menus. Most people enjoy a cup of coffee or pot of tea and a sandwich, 
but you’ll also find pastas, salads, and burgers. The cakes and other 
sweets may tempt you, too. Soho is a great area to look for a casual, 
inexpensive cafe with daily specials listed on a board outside.

 Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 143
 
 Gays and lesbians on the lookout for low-price meals in groovy gay-
friendly environments flock to Soho’s gay cafes and bars. These trendy 
hangouts serve good, reasonably priced meals and pay serious attention 
to décor.
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
If the thought of paying $50 for dinner gives you heartburn, you can visit 
pubs, cafes, sandwich bars, and pizza places to get good, economical food. 
And, of course, you can find fast-food chains throughout the city. Another 
alternative: supermarkets, where you can buy take-away meals and dine in 
your hotel room or outdoors in one of London’s beautiful parks.
In addition, many of London’s top restaurants offer fixed-price meals 
(also called set-price or prix fixe meals), which allow you to order two to 
three courses from a limited menu for a set price that’s cheaper than 
ordering the courses individually. Sometimes these bargains are called 
pre- or post-theater menus, and they’re served only from about 5:30 to 
7 p.m. and after 9:30 p.m.
Wine is expensive, so forgo that if price is an issue. And try your splurge-
dining at lunch, when prices are often one-third less than those at dinner 
and the food is the same.
Remember that tap water (never iced) will be brought to your table only 
if you request it, and your glass will not be automatically refilled. If you 
order water, and don’t specify tap water, you’ll get bottled water (either 
still or “fizzy”).
 
 Restaurants automatically add that annoying 17.5 percent value-added tax 
(VAT) to your tab. They may tack on a moderate cover charge or a charge 
for bread (even if you don’t eat it), as well.
 
 Plenty of unwary tourists double-tip without realizing it. Some restaurants 
add a service charge to your bill and also have a tip area on the credit card 
receipt that you sign. Be aware that the words service charge included on 
a menu mean that a gratuity will automatically be added to your bill. When 
the bill arrives, you’re not expected to leave any additional tip. If the menu 
says service not included, however, leave a tip of 10 percent to 15 percent 
for acceptable service.
Roast beef or royalty?
In a 2006 poll, adults in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland were asked to 
come up with an icon that summed up “traditional England.” The monarchy was the 
most popular choice at 48 percent. The runner-up was roast beef at 42 percent.

 At the end of a meal, Americans ask for a “check,” whereas Brits ask for 
the “bill.”
London’s Best Restaurants
Because London is home to literally thousands of restaurants, deciding 
which establishments to include in this chapter of my favorites was a 
monumental task. I try to cover as much of Central London as possible. 
For those who want to sample the older flavors of merry old England, I 
include some of the oldest and most respected London restaurants serv-
ing traditional English food. For the more chic and trendy, I include res-
taurants that serve the best of Modern British cuisine, as well as hybrids 
of British/French and British/Continental. For people on a budget — or 
those who just want to eat in a down-to-earth, amiable environment — I 
also review some of the best London pubs. All the establishments are 
easy to get to, and you can reach all of them by taking the Underground 
(Tube) system and perhaps walking a bit. For indexes of the restaurants 
by neighborhood, cuisine, and price, see the end of this chapter. For 
locations, refer to the maps in this chapter.
Each restaurant I review is given one to four dollar signs ($). The dollar 
signs indicate the average price of a meal, including an appetizer (starter, 
in Britspeak), entree (main course), and nonalcoholic beverage. Table 
10-1 lists the dollar amounts corresponding to the dollar signs. Please 
bear in mind that if you order the most expensive entree and a bottle of 
wine, a $$ restaurant will become a $$$$ restaurant. On the other hand, 
if you order from a set-price menu, a $$$$ restaurant tab may dip down 
to $$.

 The Kid Friendly icon in front of a restaurant name indicates that the place 
is suitable for families with children. These restaurants welcome families 
and may offer a children’s menu.
 
 Note that restaurant prices in this chapter do not include the 17.5 percent 
value-added tax (VAT). Unfortunately, you can’t avoid paying this extra 
expense.

 Benja
$$$ Soho THAI
This elegant new Thai restaurant in the Carnaby/Soho area offers “royal” 
Thai cooking from chef M. L. Kwantip, whose family provided chefs for 
Thai royalty for generations. Don’t miss the choo-chee curry with roasted 
duck and seedless grapes, or the grilled lamb wrapped in cha-plu leaves. 
Complete your meal with a traditional Thai dessert like pumpkin custard 
or black sticky rice pudding with taro jam.

Brasserie St. Quentin
$$ South Kensington FRENCH
London’s most authentic-looking French brasserie, St. Quentin attracts 
many people in the city’s French community (a positive sign for a French 
restaurant outside of France). Mirrors and crystal chandeliers add a touch 
of elegance. The brasserie has excellent-value fixed-price meals, two or 
three courses, both at lunch and pre-theater. These menus offer a blend 
of classic and updated French fare, from shoulder of lamb with root 
The skinny on the beef
Sirloin, so the story goes, got its name from James I when he was a guest at Houghton 
Tower in Lancashire. When a succulent leg of beef was placed before him, he knighted 
it with his dagger, crying, “Arise, Sir Loin!”

 Café in the Crypt
$ Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square TRADITIONAL BRITISH
Eating in a crypt may not be everyone’s idea of fun, but eating in this 
crypt — below St. Martin-in-the-Fields church on Trafalgar Square — is an 
inexpensive London dining experience that you won’t forget. The food is 
basic but good, served cafeteria-style. Choose from a big salad bar; tradi-
tional main courses, such as shepherd’s pie; filled rolls; and hearty soups. 
One fixture is that most traditional of British desserts, bread pudding 
(bread soaked in eggs and milk with currants or sultanas and then oven-
baked). The cavernous room with its stone pillars and gravestones is won-
derfully atmospheric. This is also a good place to come for an inexpensive 
afternoon tea.
See map p. 151. St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Duncannon St., WC2. % 020/7839-4342. Tube: 
Charing Cross (then a 3-minute walk west to Trafalgar Square). Main courses: £6–£9 
($9.90–$15); afternoon tea £5.15 ($8.50). No credit cards. Open: Mon–Sat 11:30 a.m.–
7:30 p.m.; Thurs–Sat 11:30 a.m.–10:15 p.m.; Sun noon to 5 p.m.
 Canteen
$–$$ Spitalfields TRADITIONAL BRITISH
A casual, moderately priced eatery in the newly refurbished Spitalfields 
Market, Canteen serves nationally sourced, additive-free, traditional 
English food. You can get breakfast all day, soup and small dishes, or 
something more substantial like an excellent meat pie, fresh fish and 
chips, or a vegetable or meat stew. This is a good place to go with kids 
because most of the dishes are available in half portions at half the price.

Cigala
$$ Bloomsbury SPANISH
This hip, Spanish-inspired restaurant serves great tapas. Order two or 
three tapas per person, and then share. Some possibilities include chorizo 
(sausage with hot paprika sauce), oak-smoked cured beef, marinated sar-
dines, wind-dried tuna, olives, and scrambled eggs with artichokes. At lunch 
or dinner, you may prefer to begin with something like grilled razor clams, 
and follow up with an entree of pork belly with beans. The paella, which 
requires 30 minutes of preparation, is delectable. The menu changes daily.

Clarke’s
$$$–$$$$ Notting Hill MODERN EUROPEAN
This bright modern restaurant, owned by chef Sally Clarke, has had a loyal 
following since opening in the 1980s. The menu changes daily but always 
emphasizes British produce and California-style chargrilled foods with 
herbs and organically grown vegetables. A typical meal may include an 
appetizer of green Italian figs with shaved Parmesan; an entree of roasted 
leg of lamb with horseradish; followed by an assortment of cheeses with 
oatmeal biscuits and celery, plus warm bitter chocolate pudding with 
whipped cream and raspberries. Most diners choose from a fixed-price 
menu. A food store is now part of the operation.

award from The Evening Standard. The food here is superb and the service 
is impeccable. Menus are compiled using only the finest naturally grown 
produce and locally harvested fish and game. Signature dishes include 
Cornish crab jelly with Melba toast; octopus carpaccio, baby squid, cho-
rizo, and feta; suckling pig sausage with oysters and duck tongue; and 
butter poached smoked haddock, with lobster and creamed parsnips. The 
set lunch menu is a bargain for food of this quality, and your meal comes 
with a carafe of wine.

Criterion Bar & Grill
$$$ Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square MODERN EUROPEAN
It’s almost worth coming to the Criterion just to see its Byzantine palace 
interior with gold-vaulted ceiling. The food — a mixture of modern 
European and traditional English standards — is generally quite good. 
You can order wild mushroom risotto with black truffle and olive oil, olive-
oil poached fish, grilled rack of lamb, and pork loin and belly with black 
pudding and pea puree. The theater menu is a good bargain for this kind 
of fancy West End location. The Criterion is also a nice place to come for 
a swanky afternoon tea.

 The Dickens Inn
$–$$ The City TRADITIONAL/MODERN BRITISH
This former spice warehouse is now a three-story restaurant with sweep-
ing Thames and Tower Bridge views. The ground-floor Tavern Bar serves 
a variety of snacks, sandwiches, and traditional pub food. Pizza on the 
Dock, a floor above and a good spot for families, offers four sizes of pizza. 
Grill on the Dock, on the top floor, is a relatively formal dining room serv-
ing Modern British cuisine; specials include steaks and a variety of char-

Ebury Wine Bar & Restaurant
$$ Westminster and Victoria MODERN BRITISH/INTERNATIONAL
This popular wine bar offers a surprisingly good and varied menu and 
excellent wines. The narrow, woodsy, attractive interior is reminiscent of 
a Paris bistro. In addition to steaks, the oft-changing menu features tradi-
tional dishes and specials such as pork mignon with roasted sweet potato 
mash, and ostrich steak with balsamic cream sauce. It has added a bar 
menu, so you can also stop in for a lamb kebab, a club sandwich, or a 
burger.
See map p. 149. 139 Ebury St., SW1. % 020/7730-5447. www.eburywinebar.
co.uk. Reservations recommended. Tube: Victoria (then a 10-minute walk west 
on Belgrave Street and south on Ebury Street). Main courses: £14–£17 ($23–$28); 
bar menu £5–£14 ($8.25–$23). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–11 p.m.; Sun 
6–11 p.m. 
 Ed’s Easy Diner
$ Soho NORTH AMERICAN
This replica of an old American diner, where customers perch on stools 
at a wraparound counter and listen to old songs blaring from the jukebox, 
is a safe bet for the kids. A bit more authentic than the version at the Pepsi 
Trocadero in Piccadilly Circus, this Ed’s still attracts a fair share of teens. 
If you’ve a yen for cholesterol-laden food, chow down on Ed’s big burgers 
with fries or onion rings, or giant kosher weenies slathered with cheddar 
cheese. On the lighter side, you can get a veggie burger, tuna salad, or a 
chicken Caesar salad.
See map p. 151. 12 Moor St. (off Cambridge Circus), W1. % 020/7439-1955. www.
edseasydiner.co.uk. Tube: Leicester Square (then a 5-minute walk north on 
Charing Cross Road and west on Moor Street). Main courses: £5–£8 ($8.25–$13). MC, 
V. Open: Mon–Sat noon to midnight; Sun noon to 11 p.m.
Fishworks
$$–$$$ Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square SEAFOOD
Fishworks is both a fishmonger (a shop selling fresh fish) and a fish restau-
rant. You can be assured that the catch is fresh — in fact, you can choose 
the fish you want, and the restaurant will prepare it the way you want. 
Main courses include fish and chips made with Icelandic cod, fishcakes 
with hollandaise sauce, Dover sole, and the various catches of the day. 
Swallow Street is hidden behind Regent Street near Piccadilly Circus; 
there is another Fishworks at 89 Marylebone High St., W10 (% 020/7935-
9796), open daily noon to 10:30 p.m.

 Food for Thought
$ Covent Garden VEGETARIAN
Covent Garden offers a plethora of expensive restaurants for meat-eaters, 
so this old-fashioned basement hole-in-the-wall with cafeteria-style ser-
vice is a pleasant and welcome alternative. The menu changes constantly, 
but the daily soup (such as carrot and fresh coriander) is always a treat, 
and the main courses can include a sweet and tangy Jamaican curry, 
Italian bean casserole, and cannelloni ripieni (stuffed with eggplant), as 
well as daily quiche and salad specials. The desserts — think apple-and-
rhubarb crumble and fruit with yogurt — are simple and satisfying.

 Fortnum & Mason
$$ St. James’s TRADITIONAL BRITISH
Fortnum & Mason, a posh, legendary London store that’s a “purveyor to 
the queen” and famous for its food section (see Chapter 12), also has three 
restaurants. The mezzanine-level Gallery is a good lunch spot, with a 
menu that offers an assortment of pricey sandwiches and main courses, 
including hot and cold pies (steak and kidney, curried fish and banana, 
chicken, and game) and Welsh rarebit (thick melted cheese poured over 
toast) prepared with Guinness stout. The lower-level Fountain offers 
breakfast and lunch, and the fourth-floor St. James’s Restaurant serves 
lunch and afternoon tea. The well-heeled dine at St. James’s, where the 
menu is traditionally British: For starters, try the kipper (smoked herring) 
mousse or potato and Stilton brûlée; main courses include pies and roast 
rib of Scottish beef. Although crowded with tourists, these three establish-
ments remain pleasant places where you can get a good meal and a 
glimpse of the fading Empire. The Parlour serves ice-cream specialties.

The Gay Hussar is considered to be one of the best Hungarian restaurants 
outside Hungary. The restaurant serves undeniably authentic Hungarian 
comfort food: chilled wild-cherry soup, caraway potatoes, cabbage stuffed 
with minced veal and rice, tender chicken served in mild paprika sauce 
with cucumber salad and noodles, and, of course, veal goulash with egg 
dumplings. The portions are large, but try to save room for the poppy-

 Gourmet Pizza Company
$ Southwark PIZZA/PASTA
This large, family-friendly restaurant on the Thames inhabits what looks 
like a temporary building, but the location is great and it provides an 
economical meal if you’re exploring the South Bank. You can choose 
from 20 varieties of pizza — everything from a B.L.T. to one with Cajun 
chicken and prawns. About half the choices are vegetarian. The crusts are

the rock memorabilia and loud music as well as the burgers and shakes. 
Vegetarian dishes are available, too. The portions are generous, and main 
dishes include salad and fries or baked potato. Consider the homemade 
apple pie, if you have room for dessert. Be prepared to stand in line on

Itsu
$ Soho JAPANESE
Itsu is popular, and with good reason: It serves better-than-average 
Japanese food at bargain prices. The cool, colorful interior is always 
abuzz, and it’s especially crowded at lunchtime. Sushi and pan-Asian 
dishes trundle past on a conveyer belt, so if something looks good, nab it. 
The seafood is always fresh; you can also get dishes like seared beef with 
a sweet dipping sauce. Another branch is located in Soho, at 103 Wardour

Joe Allen Restaurant
$$ Covent Garden NORTH AMERICAN
Joe Allen is a low-profile place on a back street in Covent Garden. Its 
crowded dining room, with checkered tablecloths, is the sort of place 
where actors like to come post-performance to scarf down chili con carne 
or gnaw on barbecued ribs. The dependable food includes American clas-
sics with some international twists, and the set menu is a real value: After 
a starter (maybe smoked haddock vichyssoise, a cold soup with fish), you 
can choose main courses such as pan-fried pork loin, Cajun chicken 
breast, and grilled lamb cutlets. If you’re a tad homesick, try a burger, a 
brownie, and a Coke for consolation. Come before the show for the best 
prices; come after the show for potential star-gazing.

get a light lunch. Dining in this vast, minimally decorated room, where 
flowers grace the tables and a magnificent selection of desserts is on call,

is quite pleasant. The meals are simple: a hearty ploughman’s lunch of 
bread and cheese or fresh salads. But it’s mostly afternoon tea that brings 
the crowds, and your tea can be as simple or extravagant as you want. A 
kid’s menu is available, too.

The menu for this bistro is English with an underplayed (some may say 
underdeveloped) French influence. Behind a brightly colored storefront, 
the dining room is covered with clusters of Japanese parasols, rococo 
mirrors, paintings, and old photographs. Depending on the season, the 
fixed-price menu may start with crispy onion with pan-fried bok choy and 
move on to pan-fried lamb kidneys, beef and onion pie, or poached monk-
fish. The dessert extravaganza known as Mrs. Langan’s Chocolate Pudding 
is a must for chocoholics.

Here’s a fine little Italian restaurant that most tourists never find. Locals 
in Holborn flock to it, especially at lunchtime, because the food is so good 
and so reasonably priced. All the classic Italian pasta dishes are here, 
including deliciously sauced spaghetti, linguine, tortellini, ravioli, 
tagliatelle, and risotto. Veal scaloppini, grilled chicken, and steak are avail-
able, as are fresh fish dishes and delicious pizza. The menu is small and

This microbrewery/cafe, a few steps from Oxford Street, has a bar (with 
good home brews and bar food) on the first floor and a gastropublike 
restaurant, with a full-view kitchen, on the second. The menu is short and 
to the point: fresh fish, deluxe burgers, steaks, and a few pizzas. It can be 
a trend scene, which is all part of the fun, but the service isn’t always up 
to snuff.

Mela claims to take its inspiration from a food stall favored by workers in 
Delhi, and lunch here is a fantastic deal: curry or dahl of the day, with bread, 
pickle, and chutney, for under £3 ($4.95). Pay a little more, and you can 
build your own version of the meal, with different breads and toppings. This 
is a great, inexpensive way for curry novices to give it a try — and see it 
being made in the open kitchen. But do come back in the evening for a 
proper go at the innovative Indian country cuisine. Early birds get three 
courses. Fixed-price sharers have ten dishes and accompaniments between 
them. The word mela means “fair,” and Mela the restaurant does its best to 
create a festive atmosphere.

place to enjoy a light bite, afternoon tea with warm scones and clotted 
cream, or a glass of wine. Have a look at the artwork — it’s all by young, 
unknown artists chosen by Saatchi; sit outside if the weather’s fine.

popular cafe by day, the place becomes a restaurant at night, although 
they serve many of the same dishes for lunch and dinner. Everything is 
homemade and fresh, and the ambience is informal and fun. The menu 
includes many fish dishes, including sea bass and Dover sole. Pasta da 
Vinci, a house specialty, is pasta cooked in a paper bag with a sauce of 
squid, mussels, and prawns. Salad lovers can try the Mona Lisa salad with 
mozzarella, tomatoes, crispy bacon, avocado, and basil.

dish. Definitely try this unassuming chippie, where the fish is always fresh. 
This restaurant, with its sepia prints and red velvet seats, is pleasant, 
comfortable, and popular with adults and kids. You may want to start with 
grilled fresh sardines or a fish cake before digging into a main course of 
cod or haddock. The fish is most often served battered and deep-fried, but 
you can also order it grilled. The chips are almost as good as the fish.

Restaurant, its food is marvelous and costs about half of what you pay to 
dine on tablecloths. The superlative river-and-city views are just as sub-
lime, so book in advance and insist on a window table. Recently the res-
taurant was taken over by Harvey Nichols, and the food has taken on more 
fusion elements. Order such tasty dishes as braised rabbit with porcini 
mushrooms, seared scallops, or chargrilled pork chops. The fixed-price

When a pub upgrades its food to restaurant standards, it becomes known

you’re on a budget, eat in the less-expensive bar downstairs; the season-
ally adjusted menu has fewer choices, but the cooking is just as good (if 
not quite as elaborate) as it is in the dining room upstairs. Look for spe-
cialties like chilled pea and mint soup, crab salad on watermelon, and 
spicy potted shrimps. Or order eight bite-size canapés for £8.50 ($14) and 
sample a bit of everything.

lamb and apricot; and steak, mushroom, and Guinness stout. Forgo appe-

$$$ The Strand BRITISH/FRENCH
This former passenger boat is permanently moored in the Thames 
and provides good food and spectacular views of the river traffic. The 
menu changes often, with a variety of sturdy and generally well-prepared 
dishes, such as pork tenderloin with apple and sage puree, rack of lamb, 
poached halibut, and several vegetarian dishes. The place can be fun and 
romantic — live music is played most nights. This is also an unusual spot 
for afternoon tea.

 Rules
$$–$$$$ Covent Garden TRADITIONAL BRITISH
If you want to eat classic British cuisine in a memorable (nay, venerable) 
setting, put on something dressy and head for Maiden Lane. Founded in 
1798, Rules is London’s oldest restaurant, with two centuries’ worth of 
prints, cartoons, and paintings decorating its walls. If you’re game for 
game, go for it, because that’s what Rules is famous for. On the menu, you 
may find roast loin of Wiltshire rabbit, Irish sirloin steak with béarnaise 
sauce, or Gloucestershire pork chops with crackling and chutney. The 
food is delicious — traditional yet innovative, until you get to the pud-
dings (desserts), which are a mix of nursery and dinner-dance classics. In 
recent years, the restaurant has added fish and a few vegetarian dishes. 
The restaurant is completely nonsmoking; a “smart casual” dress code is 
in effect, so don’t arrive wearing shorts or jeans.

Simpson’s-in-the-Strand
$$$ The Strand TRADITIONAL/MODERN BRITISH
Simpson’s, in this location since 1848, is — or used to be — a London 
institution serving the best of traditional English food. Lately, however, 
complaints of sloppy service and indifferent cooking have made dining 
here a hit-or-miss experience for some. You still find the largest array of 
roasts in London: sirloin of beef, saddle of mutton with red-currant jelly, 
and Aylesbury duckling. (Remember to tip the tail-coated carver.) For a 
pudding (dessert course), you may want to order treacle roll and custard, 
or Stilton with vintage port. A smart-casual dress code is in effect — leave 
your tennis shoes and jeans in your hotel room.

 Stockpot
$ Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square  BRITISH/CONTINENTAL
Now here’s a dining bargain! This simple bi-level restaurant in the heart of 
the West End doesn’t offer refined cooking, but the food is filling and the 
price is right — making it a good spot for families. You can find such sta-
ples as minestrone soup, spaghetti Bolognese (the eternal favorite), 
braised lamb, and apple crumble on the fixed-price daily menu. (During 
peak dining hours, you may have to share a table with other guests.) 
Always reliable, and one of the few bargain dining spots left in London.

mussels, a house specialty, or a New Zealand meat or fish pie. You can 
also get New Zealand rack of lamb. You can choose from several sharing 
platters: Italian antipasti, vegetarian, Greek, seafood, and cheese. A must-
have dessert is Pavlova, a light meringue covered with kiwi, strawberries, 
passion fruit, and mangoes. And, of course, you can get a fine glass of 
Australian wine.

Veeraswamy
$$–$$$$ Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square INDIAN
Established in 1926 by a general and an Indian princess, Veeraswamy 
claims to be the oldest Indian restaurant in London. Nowadays, it’s very 
hip and resolutely upscale, painted in vibrant colors, with frosted-glass 
panels dividing up the sections and ultramodern furniture. For starters, 
the stir-fried mussels with coconut and Kerala spices are sublime. For an 
exotic and only mildly hot choice, try the shanks of lamb curried in bone 
stock and spices. Unless you’re in the mood to splurge, this isn’t the place 
to sample lots of different dishes. Go for a great-value fixed-price menu 
and enjoy the best of new Indian cuisine.

 Wagamama Noodle Bar
$–$$ Soho JAPANESE
Try this trendsetting noodle bar, modeled after the ramen shops of Japan, 
if you’re exploring Soho and want a delicious, nutritious meal. You enter 
along a stark, glowing hall with a busy open kitchen and descend to a large 
open room with communal tables. The specialties are ramen, Chinese-
style thread noodles served in soups with various toppings, and the fat, 
white noodles called udon. You can also order various rice dishes, vege-
tarian dishes, dumplings, vegetable and chicken skewers, and tempura. 
Your order is sent via radio signal to the kitchen and arrives the moment 
it’s ready, which means that not everyone in a group is served at the same 
time. You may have to stand in line to get in, but it’s worth the wait. Teens 
especially love the loud, hip, casual atmosphere. Several branches of 
Wagamamas are scattered around London, including a new one on the 
river, beneath Royal Festival Hall, on the South Bank.

 Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese
$$ The City TRADITIONAL BRITISH
Opened as a tavern in 1667 and a one-time haunt of Samuel Johnson, 
Charles Dickens, and Fleet Street newspaper scandalmongers, Ye Olde 
Cheshire Cheese is London’s most famous chophouse and a wonderfully 
atmospheric place to dine. The place contains six bars and two dining 
rooms (reserve a table in The Chop Room for the most traditional dining 
experience) and is perennially popular with families and tourists looking 
for some Olde London atmosphere. The house specialties include Ye 
Famous Pudding (steak, kidney, mushrooms, and game), Scottish roast 
beef with Yorkshire pudding and horseradish sauce, and fish and chips. If 
those choices repulse the kids, they can choose sandwiches or salads.

 Zafferano
$$$$ Knightsbridge ITALIAN
At Zafferano, you find the best Italian food in London, served in a quietly 
elegant, attitude-free restaurant. The semolina pastas are perfectly cooked 
and come with various additions. The main courses, such as roast rabbit 
with Parma ham and polenta, chargrilled chicken, and tuna with arugula 
and tomato salad, are deliciously simple and tender. For dessert, try the 
pear and almond tart with mascarpone ice cream.

Dining and Snacking on the Go
Londoners have a somewhat traditional outlook on food and meals. You 
won’t see many adults in London eating on the street or having a bite 
while traveling the Tube. It’s mostly tourists carrying those Starbucks 
cups. And you don’t find street vendors peddling hot dogs and other 
foods from carts (although you may see a fast-food van or two near 
major attractions). Even the most frenetic Londoner likes to eat a 
proper, civilized “sit-down” meal. So, what’s a too-rushed tourist to do? 
To help you enjoy snacks and light meals the London way, I offer some 
interesting alternatives to fast-food restaurants.
Sandwich bars
Sandwiches are an English invention (supposedly of the Earl of 
Sandwich), and sandwich bars are a faster and cheaper alternative to sit-
down restaurants and pubs. Most open early for breakfast and close in 
the afternoon. You can usually eat at a counter or in booths, or you can 
take your sandwich and go to the nearest park for an alfresco lunch. The 
bars sell coffee, tea, and nonalcoholic beverages.
 
 American visitors are sometimes confused by the way the English name 
their sandwiches. In general, the Brits use the word mayonnaise the way 
that Americans use salad. Tuna mayonnaise or egg mayonnaise simply 
means “tuna salad” or “egg salad.” The word salad is used in Britain to 
denote that lettuce and tomato have been added to a sandwich, as in 
“chicken with salad.”
The following sandwich bars are worth a bite:
 
✓ Near Victoria Station, Capri Sandwich Bar (16 Lower Belgrave Rd., 
NW1; % 020/7834-1989; Tube: Victoria; see map p. 149) serves 
an imaginative variety of sandwiches. The bar is open Monday 
through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

 Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 171
 
✓ If you’re in the vicinity of Euston Station, try the unpretentious but 
cheerful Giovanni’s Sandwich Bar (152 N. Gower St., at Euston 
Road; % 020/7383-0531; Tube: Euston; see map p. 151), open 
Monday through Friday 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.
 
 The best sandwich shops in Central London are the Pret à Manger chain 
stores, which offer fresh, inventive, healthy sandwiches and fast counter 
service. A convenient West End branch is located at 77–78 St. Martin’s 
Lane, WC2 (% 020/7379-5335; Tube: Leicester Square; see map p. 150). 
It’s open Monday through Thursday 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday 7:30 a.m. to 
11 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. You’ll find 
Pret à Manger all over the city.
Fish and chips
The English call a fish and chips place a chippie. At some chippies, the 
food is wonderful; at others, it’s hideous. At the good places (the only 
ones that I recommend), the fish (usually cod, haddock, or plaice) is 
fresh, the batter crisp, and the chips (fries) hand-cut. You can get tartar 
sauce, but the British also like to splash their fish and chips with malt 
vinegar. Prices for fish have gone up considerably, so fish and chips are 
no longer the bargain they used to be.
 The following restaurants all have sit-down and takeaway (takeout) ser-
vice and welcome families with kids. Also, see the North Sea Fish 
Restaurant in the section “London’s Best Restaurants,” earlier in this 
chapter.
 
✓ Costas Fish Restaurant (see map p. 154; 18 Hillgate St., W8; % 020/
7727-4310; Tube: Notting Hill Gate) is open Tuesday through 
Saturday noon to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. Main courses cost 
£5.25 to £8 ($8.65–$13).
 
 
✓ Fryer’s Delight (see map p. 151; 19 Theobald’s Rd., WC1; % 020/
7405-4114; Tube: Chancery Lane or Holborn) is across from the 
Holborn Police Station. Main courses range from £5.50 to £7 
($9.10–$12); takeaway is also available. The Formica-clad chippie 
is open Monday through Saturday noon to 10 p.m. The fish is fried 
in beef fat here; other options include pastries and pies.
 
✓ Geales (see map p. 154; 2 Farmer St., W8; % 020/7727-7969; Tube: 
Notting Hill Gate) is open Tuesday through Sunday noon to 3 p.m. 
and 6 to 10:30 p.m. Main courses run £8 to £17 ($13–$28).
 
 
✓ Golden Hind (see map p. 151; 73 Marylebone Lane, W1; % 020/
7486-3644; Tube: Baker Street or Bond Street) is a few blocks south 
of Madame Tussauds. This bargain chippie has an average meal 
cost of £5 to £11 ($8.25–$18); hours are Monday through Friday 
noon to 3 p.m. and Monday through Saturday 6 to 10 p.m.
 
✓ Rock & Sole Plaice (see map p. 151; 47 Endell St., WC2; % 020/
7836-3785; Tube: Covent Garden) offers all-day takeaway service, 

Part III: Settling into London 
172
as well as a place to sit down and eat amid the bustle of Covent 
Garden. Because of its location, this chippie crowds with tourists 
during the day and theatergoers in the evening. You pay at least 
£10 ($17) for a meal. It’s open Monday through Saturday 11:30 a.m. 
to 11:30 p.m. and Sunday noon to 10 p.m.
 
✓ Seafresh Fish Restaurant (see map p. 149; 80–81 Wilton Rd., SW1; 
% 020/7828-0747; Tube: Victoria) offers a good cod filet and great 
chips for about £10 ($17). There are fixed-price lunches at £11 and 
£12 ($18 and $20). It’s open Monday through Friday noon to 3 p.m. 
and 5 to 10:30 p.m.
 
✓ Sea-Shell (see map p. 155; 49–51 Lisson Grove, NW1; % 020/7723-
8703; Tube: Marylebone) is within easy walking distance west of 
Madame Tussauds and is considered one of the best chippies in 
London; it’s been in business for over 30 years. Main courses range 
from £11 to £15 ($18–$25). It’s open Monday through Friday noon 
to 2:30 p.m. and 5 to 10:30 p.m., Saturday noon to 10:30 p.m.
 
 Costas Fish Restaurant and Geales are both good choices if you’ve been 
poking around the antiques and whatnot stands along Portobello Road.
Department-store restaurants
If you’re in the midst of a shopping spree and don’t want to be dis-
tracted, you can easily grab a bite at one of the many department-store 
restaurants. These eateries are convenient, but they aren’t necessarily 
cheap; see the restaurant entry for Fortnum & Mason in the section 
“London’s Best Restaurants,” earlier in this chapter. A new trend among 
high-end boutiques is to have a fancy little cafe or coffee bar right on 
the premises.
Here are some more department-store possibilities:
 
✓ Harrods (see map p. 152; 87–135 Brompton Rd., SW1; % 020/7730-
1234; Tube: Knightsbridge), in addition to its ice cream parlor and 
awe-inspiring Food Hall, offers its Famous Deli Counter, where you 
can perch on stools (no reservations) and pay too much for what’s 
called “traditional Jewish food” but often isn’t. It’s open Monday 
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 
✓ Harvey Nichols (see map p. 152; 109–125 Knightsbridge, SW7; 
% 020/7235-5250; Tube: Knightsbridge) is another Knightsbridge 
emporium with a restaurant, The Fifth Floor. It’s open Monday 
through Friday noon to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 10 p.m., but eating here 
is pretty expensive. A better bet is the cafe, also on the fifth floor, 
where you can get a cup of tea and a salad or light meal; it’s open 
Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m. Like Harrods, Harvey Nichols has a fabulous food emporium 
where you can buy now and eat later.

 Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 173
Treating Yourself to Tea
The stereotype is true: Brits do drink tea, though consumption is drop-
ping because of the new emphasis on coffee. Teatime is traditionally from 
about 3:30 to 5 p.m. Your afternoon tea can be a lavish affair served by a 
black-coated waiter in a posh hotel lobby, or a quick cup with a slice of 
cake or a sandwich at a corner tea shop or patisserie (a bakery where you 
can sit down or get pastries to take away). Tea may be served fast-food-
style in paper cups, home-style in mugs, or more elegantly on bone china.
So what exactly, you ask, is the difference between afternoon tea and 
high tea?
 
✓ Afternoon tea is tea with cakes, scones, sandwiches, or all of them, 
served between 3 and 5 p.m. It’s a pre-dinner ritual.
 
✓ High tea, served from about 5 to 6 p.m., is a more of a light supper, 
followed by dessert and tea.
Casual tea rooms and patisseries
In the following comfortable neighborhood tearooms and patisseries, 
you can get a good cup of tea, along with a scone or other pastry or a 
plate of tea sandwiches, for about £4 to £10 ($6.60–$17).
 
✓ Cafe Parlour at Sketch (see map p. 151; 9 Conduit St., W1; % 0870/
777-4488; www.sketch.uk.com; Tube: Oxford Circus) offers 
superb pastries and cakes in a room that makes up the patisserie 
component of the ultrahip Sketch, a gastro-empire founded by Pierre 
Gagnaire. You can also get breakfast and lunch. Worth a visit just to 
see the loos. Hours are Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., 
Saturday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.
 
✓ Muffinski’s (see map p. 151; 5 King St., WC2; % 020/7379-1525; 
Tube: Leicester Square) offers great homemade muffins, including 
low-fat, organic, and vegetarian. Hours are Monday through 
Friday 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Never too latte: London’s coffee bars
It had to happen sooner or later, and frankly I’m glad it did, because although tea is 
ubiquitous, finding a good cup of coffee in London wasn’t always the easiest thing to 
do. But now Starbucks has opened branches all over the city, offering nice places to sit 
down and have a latte, cappuccino, or “regular” cup of joe. Starbucks also sells pas-
tries and sandwiches. Costas is another coffee chain with branches everywhere.

line night or day. Hours are Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 
8 p.m., Saturday 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Sunday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

✓ Richoux has three old-fashioned tearooms in choice London loca-
tions. They serve food all day long, and they’re kind to your budget.

Piccadilly (see map p. 150; 172 Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7493-2204; 
Tube: Piccadilly Circus). All locations keep basically the same 
hours: Monday through Saturday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. (the Mayfair 
branch is open until 9 p.m.), Sunday 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. (the Mayfair 
branch is open until 9 p.m.). The Web site for all locations is www.

Elegant spots for high tea
A traditional afternoon English tea has cakes, sandwiches, and scones 
with clotted cream and jam, and is taken in a posh hotel or restaurant. 
These rather lavish affairs are ridiculously expensive but memorable. 
At any one of the following places, you can get a proper traditional after-
noon or high tea, sometimes with strawberries and champagne. Also 
check out the less expensive and atmospheric Café in the Crypt, beneath 
St. Martin-in-the-Fields church, the Kensington Palace Orangery, and the 
R.S. Hispaniola docked on the Thames (all are reviewed earlier in this 

 Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 175

costs £22 ($36) per person, and you don’t need reservations.
 
✓ The Lanesborough Hotel (see map p. 149; Hyde Park Corner, SW1; 
% 02072/595-599; Tube: Hyde Park Corner) requires reservations 
for high tea, daily from 3:30 to 6 p.m., which costs £33 to £65 
($54–$107).
Planning a Picnic
London may not be the perfect city for picnics. Rain can quickly put a 
damper on a picnic hamper, and nothing is quite as unappetizing as 
a wet sandwich. But on days when the weather cooperates, nothing is 
more enjoyable than packing up some sandwiches and heading to a 
special spot to eat outdoors.
Glean your picnic pickings from supermarkets, delis, and sandwich 
shops (see “Sandwich bars,” earlier in this chapter), or drop in at the 
legendary and far more expensive food halls at Fortnum & Mason or 
Harrods. Marks & Spencer also has a food hall. In neighborhoods out-
side the West End (South Kensington or Marylebone, for example), you 
can go into any supermarket and find packaged sandwiches, crisps 
(potato chips), fresh fruit, and drinks.

In the West End, the Embankment Gardens is a pretty picnic spot, look-
ing out on the Thames. This flower-filled strip of green is next to the 
Embankment Tube station, below the Savoy hotel. You have to sit on 
benches instead of the grass, and the traffic noise along the 
Embankment can be annoying, but it’s still a nice place to know about. 
Sandwich shops and takeaway food shops are clustered around the 
Embankment Tube station.
Kensington Gardens (see Chapter 11) offers vast green lawns, frolic-
some fountains, Kensington Palace, and the famous statue of Peter Pan. 
This spot is a favorite with children of all ages. The park is close to all 
the great museums in South Ken. Adjacent Hyde Park is another lovely 
picnic site, particularly along the shores of Serpentine Lake. You can 
buy sandwiches and snacks at the Dell Restaurant (see Chapter 11) at 
the east end of the lake. In summer, bandstand concerts are given in 
the park.
The royal parks — Green Park and St. James’s Park — are more sedate. 
You can choose to picnic on a lovely knoll and gaze upon Buckingham 
Palace.
Looking for an urban space that’s good for people-watching and has 
great views across the river? Picnic on the South Bank of the Thames, 
along the riverside promenade close to Royal Festival Hall and the 
National Theatre.

Exploring London

In this part . . . 
R
eady to hit the streets? Raring to go? Turn to Chapter 11 
for descriptions of London’s top sights — along with 
directions, opening hours, and admission prices; you can also 
fi nd my rundown of additional sights to see, all of them 
intriguing and worth exploring. In Chapter 11, I also tell you 
about the best options for guided tours of London by bus, by 
boat, and on foot.
Check out Chapter 12 for some great tips on how to make the 
most of your shopping in London, as well as specifi c stores to 
visit. Chapter 13 gives you four suggested London itineraries — 
sightseeing strategies to help you enjoy the city on a realistic 
schedule. Finally, in Chapter 14, I send you on your way to six 
fascinating places that you can explore on day trips; I think 
you’ll love each and every one of them.

Chapter 11
Discovering London’s 
Top Attractions
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing London’s top attractions
▶ Finding sights and activities for history buffs, art lovers, bookworms, kids, 
gardeners, and others
▶ Visiting royal palaces and castles
▶ Focusing on Greenwich, home of the Prime Meridian
▶ Listing London’s sights by neighborhood and type
H
ere’s the big question: What do you want to see and enjoy while 
you’re in London? The possibilities are endless: fabulous muse-
ums, royal palaces, important historic sites, beautiful parks and gardens, 
and grand churches. In this chapter, I give you the information that you 
need to make your itinerary fit your interests, time, and energy level.
 
 To help you find your way around London, you may want to go beyond my 
directions in this chapter and get yourself a London A–Z map. Even 
Londoners use this comprehensive street gazette, which comes in many 
different formats and can be found at just about every bookstore and 
news kiosk in London.
I arrange the top sights in this chapter alphabetically. For locations, see 
the “London’s Top Sights” map on p. 186. Following the must-see list are 
more top attractions grouped together by type. For the locations of 
these sights, turn to the “More London Sights” map on p. 210. To help 
you pull together your itinerary, see the end of this chapter, where I 
index all the top attractions by neighborhood and type. (For useful infor-
mation about planning workable itineraries, based on the length of your 
trip, turn to Chapter 13.)
 
 London’s top museums are spectacular treasure-troves — and they’re all 
absolutely free. To save money on transportation costs, buy one of the 
single-day or multiday Travelcards I describe in Chapter 8.

The Top Attractions from A to Z
 The British Museum
Bloomsbury
The British Museum ranks as the most visited attraction in London, with 
a splendid, wide-ranging collection of treasures from around the world.
Wandering through the museum’s 94 galleries (see the map “The British 
Museum” on p. 189), you can’t help but be struck by humanity’s enduring 
creative spirit. Permanent displays of antiquities from Egypt, Western 
Asia, Greece, and Rome are on view, as well as prehistoric and Romano-
British, Medieval, Renaissance, Modern, and Oriental collections.
In November 2000, the museum’s Great Court reopened with a glass-and-
steel roof designed by Lord Norman Foster. Inaccessible to the general 
public for 150 years, the Great Court is now the museum’s new central 
axis. In the center, you find a circular building completed in 1857 that once 
served as the museum’s famous Reading Room. Completely restored, it 
now houses computer terminals where visitors can access images and 
information about the museum’s vast collections.
The most famous of the museum’s countless treasures are the superb 
Parthenon Sculptures brought to England in 1801 by the seventh Lord 
Elgin. These marble sculptures once adorned the Parthenon in Athens, 
and Greece wants them returned.
 
 To enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the Parthenon 
Sculptures, pick up one of the sound guides available right outside Room 
18 on the first floor, where the sculptures are exhibited; the guide costs 
£3.50 ($5.80).
Other famous treasures in the museum include the Rosetta Stone, which 
enabled archaeologists to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics; the Sutton 
Hoo Treasure, an Anglo-Saxon burial ship, believed to be the tomb of a 
7th-century East Anglian king; and Lindow Man, a well-preserved ancient 
corpse found in a bog. The museum’s ethnography collections are filled 
with marvelous curiosities: everything from a pair of polar-bear slacks 
worn by Eskimos to a Hawaiian god with a mohawk haircut, found by 
Captain Cook and shipped back to London.
 
 Give yourself at least three unhurried hours in the museum. You can avoid 
big crowds by going on a weekday morning. If you have only limited time 
for the British Museum, consider taking one of the 90-minute highlight 
tours offered daily at 10:30 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.; these tours cost £8 
($13). You can rent audio tours, which also cover museum highlights, for 
£3.50 ($5.80). Tickets and information for guided tours and audio tours is 
available at the information desk in the Great Court. On the museum’s 
Web site, you can download one-hour and three-hour itineraries as well 
as an itinerary for visiting the museum with children.

side of Russell Square, to the museum entrance on Great Russell Street). Admission:

 Buckingham Palace
St. James’s
Since 1837, when Victoria ascended the throne, all the majesty, scandal, 
intrigue, triumph, tragedy, power, pomp, wealth, and tradition associated 
with the British monarchy has been hidden behind the monumental 
facade of Buckingham Palace, the reigning monarch’s London residence.
An impressive early 18th-century pile, the palace was rebuilt in 1825 and 
further modified in 1913. From late July through September, when the 
royal family isn’t in residence, you can buy a ticket to get a glimpse of the 
impressive staterooms used by Elizabeth II and the other royals. You 
don’t get a guided palace tour; instead, you can pick up an audio guide 
(included in the admission price) and wander at your own pace through 
19 rooms (including the Throne Room and the vast ballroom built by 
Queen Victoria), most of them decorated in a mid-Victorian style and filled 
with a priceless collection of paintings. In these rooms, the queen receives 
guests on official occasions. You leave through the gardens where the 
queen holds her famous garden parties each summer. Budget about two 
hours for your visit.
Throughout the year, you can visit the Royal Mews, one of the finest work-
ing stables in existence, where the magnificent Gold State Coach, used in 
every coronation since 1831, and other royal conveyances are housed 
(and horses stabled). The Queen’s Gallery, which features changing 
exhibits of works from the Royal Collection, went through a refurbishment 
and reopened for the queen’s Golden Jubilee in June 2002. The palace lies 
between Green Park and St. James’s Park, described later in this 
chapter.
 
 You can buy admission tickets for Buckingham Palace by calling % 020/
7766-7300. There’s also a ticket office at the visitor entrance to the palace 
on Buckingham Palace Road, open daily 9:15 a.m. to 5 p.m. from the end 
of July to the end of September. Keep in mind that every visitor gets a 
specific time for entry into the palace, which is why phoning ahead for 
tickets is smart. All phone-charged tickets cost an additional £1 ($1.65).
See map p. 186. Buckingham Palace Road, SW1. Palace Visitor Office, Royal Mews, 
and Queen’s Gallery % 020/7839-1377 (9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.) or 020/7799-2331 (24-hour 
recorded info). www.royal.gov.uk. Tube: St. James’s Park (then a 10-minute

accessible.
 
 Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace
St. James’s
Free of charge, you can stand outside Buckingham Palace and watch the 
Foot Guards of the Household Division of the Army, the queen’s personal 
guard, carry out the Changing of the Guard. The Old Guard forms in the 
palace forecourt before going off duty and handing everything over to the 
New Guard, which leaves Wellington Barracks at precisely 11:27 a.m. and 
marches to the palace via Birdcage Walk, usually accompanied by a band. 
The guard consists of 3 officers and 40 men, but this number decreases 
when the queen is away. The entire ceremony takes around 40 minutes. If 
you can’t find a spot at the front of the railings of Buckingham Palace, you 
can see pretty well from the Victoria Memorial in front of the palace.
Clarence House: Another royal residence
Clarence House, located near Buckingham Palace, in St. James’s Park between the 
Mall and Pall Mall, is another working palace you might want to visit. From 1953 to 2002, 
it was the home of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and today it serves as the offi-
cial residence of HRH The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall (a.k.a., Prince 
Charles and his second wife, the former Camilla Parker-Bowles) and the home of Prince 
William and Prince Harry. Visitors are guided around the five ground-floor rooms where 
the royal residents undertake official engagements and receive guests from around the 
world. The arrangement of the rooms and the grouping of their contents remain much 
as they were in Queen Elizabeth’s time, including the late Queen Mum’s collection of 
outstanding 20th-century paintings and important works by John Piper, Graham 
Sutherland, Walter Sickert, and Augustus John. Superb examples of Fabergé, English 
porcelain, and silver — particularly pieces relating to the Queen Mum’s family, the 
Bowes-Lyons — are also on display. Clarence House is open to the public in August 
and September daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is £8 ($13) adults and seniors, £4 
($6.60) children 5 to 15.

 The pageantry of the Changing of the Guard is no longer a daily occur-
rence. From August through December, the event takes place at 11:30 a.m. 
on alternate days of the week (Aug–Sept and Nov–Dec on odd days [1, 3, 
5, and so on]; Oct on even days). To avoid disappointment, make sure to 
call ahead or check the Web site.

 Covent Garden Market and Piazza
Covent Garden
In 1970, the old, noisy, bustling public market where vendors hawked fruit, 
produce, and flowers moved out of Covent Garden, and the area became 
the site of London’s earliest and most successful urban recycling effort. 
The market buildings now house dozens of enticing shops and eating and 
drinking places. The wrought-iron stalls in the former Flower Market are 
loaded with vendors. The piazza in front may be the most popular public 
gathering place outside of Trafalgar Square; the space is always “heaving,” 
as the Brits say. Covent Garden is also the home of the Royal Opera 
House (see Chapter 15) and the excellent Transport Museum (see the 
“Places that please kids” section, later in this chapter).
See map p. 186. Tube: Covent Garden (when you come out of the Tube stop, you’re 
in Covent Garden; the market and piazza are a 1-minute walk south in a pedestrian-
only zone).
Houses of Parliament and Big Ben
Westminster
The Houses of Parliament, situated along the Thames, house the land-
mark clock tower containing Big Ben, the largest bell in the booming 
hourly chime that Londoners have been hearing for nearly 150 years. 
More guard changing
If you miss the Changing of the Guard, or the event doesn’t take place on the day of your 
visit, you can still get an eyeful of London pageantry by attending the Mounted Guard 
Changing Ceremony at the Horse Guards Building in Whitehall. These are the same 
guards as the ones at Buckingham Palace, only on horseback. The ceremony takes 
place daily Monday through Saturday at 11 a.m. and Sunday at 10 a.m. You don’t need 
a ticket, but arrive early for a good view. To get there, take the Tube to Charing Cross 
and walk south from Trafalgar Square along Whitehall (about a five-minute walk); the 
Horse Guards Building will be on your right.

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 193
Designed by Sir Charles Barry and A. W. N. Pugin, the Parliament’s impres-
sive Victorian buildings were completed in 1857. Covering approximately 
8 acres, they occupy the site of an 11th-century palace of Edward the 
Confessor.
At one end (Old Palace Yard) you find the Jewel House, built in 1366 and 
once the treasury house of Edward III, who reigned from 1327 to 1377. The 
best overall view of the Houses of Parliament is from Westminster Bridge, 
but if you prefer, you can sit in the Stranger’s Gallery to hear a 
Parliamentary debate.
 
 Previously, overseas visitors had to go through an elaborate procedure 
weeks in advance of their trip in order to tour the Houses of Parliament. 
Now, however, 75-minute guided tours are available Monday through 
Saturday in August and September. The tours cost £7.80 ($13) for adults, 
and you can book your ticket in advance through Ticketmaster (% 0844/
847-1672; www.ticketmaster.co.uk). You can also buy tickets at the 
kiosk across the street from Westminster Hall (near the Jewel Tower). For 
the rest of the year, the procedure for getting a tour is much more 
difficult. If you’re interested, you can find details on the Web, at www.
parliament.uk.

late July to mid-Oct or Sat–Sun. Guided tours: Aug–Sept; call or check Web site for 
tour times.
Big Ben tolls for thee
Big Ben isn’t the name of the clock tower or its clock. It’s the name of the largest bell 
that you hear booming in that famous hourly chime. Some people believe that the bell 
was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, the commissioner of works when the bell was hung 
in 1859. Others maintain that Big Ben was named for a champion prizefighter of the time, 
Ben Gaunt.
The 5-ton clock mechanism housed in the 316-foot tower kept ticking until 1976, when 
it succumbed to “metal fatigue” and had to be repaired. At night, new energy-efficient 
lighting now gives the illuminated clock faces a greenish tinge. The light at the very top 
is lit when Parliament is in session.
Trivia buffs will be interested to know that the minute hands on each of the tower’s four 
clocks are as large as a double-decker bus. For information on touring the tower holding 
Big Ben, which you can do only if you’re a U.K. resident and if you write for tickets three 
months in advance, go to www.parliament.uk.

 Hyde Park
Westminster
Once the private hunting domain of Henry VIII, Hyde Park is one of the 
largest urban parks in the world. With adjoining Kensington Gardens, it 
offers 255 hectares (630 acres) of lushly landscaped lawns, magnificent 
flower beds, avenues of trees, and a 17-hectare (41-acre) lake known as the 
Serpentine, where you can row and sail model boats. Rotten Row, the 
park’s famous 300-year-old riding track, was the country’s first public road 
to be lit at night. At the northeastern tip, near Marble Arch, Speakers’ 
Corner is a famous Sunday-morning venting spot for anyone who wants to 
climb up on a soapbox. Free band concerts are held in the park’s band 
shell on Sundays and Bank Holidays May through August, and the Dell 
Restaurant (% 020/7706-0464), at the east end of the Serpentine, offers 
cafeteria-style food and drinks daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in winter (to 5 p.m. 
Sat–Sun) and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer (to 7 p.m. Sat–Sun). The park is a 
pleasant place for an hour’s stroll, but staying longer is always tempting.
See map p. 186. Bounded by Knightsbridge to the south, Bayswater Road to the 
north, and Park Lane to the east. % 020/7298-2100. www.royalparks.org.uk. 
Tube: Marble Arch or Lancaster Gate on the north side (the park is directly across 
Bayswater Road) or Hyde Park Corner in the southeast corner of the park. Open: 
Daily dawn to midnight.
 Kensington Gardens
Kensington
Kensington Gardens adjoins Hyde Park west of the lake known as the 
Serpentine. Children especially love the famous bronze statue of Peter 
Pan, located north of the Serpentine Bridge. Commissioned in 1912 by 
Peter Pan’s creator, J. M. Barrie, the statue marks the spot where Peter 
Pan, in the book Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, entered the gardens to 
get to his home on Serpentine Island.
The park is also home to the Albert Memorial, an ornate neo-Gothic memo-
rial honoring Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert; the lovely Italian 
Gardens; and the free Serpentine Gallery (% 020/7298-1515), which has 
a reputation for showing cutting-edge art and is open daily (except Dec 
24–27 and Jan 1) 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Princess Diana Memorial Playground 
is in the northwest corner of the park. If the weather is fine, give yourself 
enough time for a leisurely stroll — at least a couple of hours.

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 195
 
 Kensington Palace
Kensington Gardens
Kensington Palace was used as a royal residence until 1760. Victoria was 
born in this palace, and it was here, in 1837 when she was 18 years old, 
that she was awakened from her slumbers and informed that she was the 
new queen of England (and could move to the grander Buckingham 
Palace). One wing of Kensington Palace (not open to visitors) was Princess 
Diana’s London home after her divorce from Prince Charles. The palace 
was also home to Princess Margaret, who died in 2002, and remains the 
home of other “grace and favor” royals and dependents (the Crown pro-
vides them with free housing). Visitors can visit the State Apartments, 
several interesting exhibits relating to the history of the palace, and see 
some of Diana’s dresses in the new Diana, fashion and style exhibit. The 
freshly restored King’s Apartment features a magnificent collection of Old 
Masters. Give yourself about an hour and a half to view the palace.
 
 For a pleasant and not-too-expensive tea or snack after visiting Kensington 
Palace, stop in at The Orangery (% 020/7376-0239), in the gardens adja-
cent to the palace. (For more information, see Chapter 10.)
See map p. 186. The Broad Walk, Kensington Gardens, W8. % 0870/751-5170. www.
hrp.org.uk. Tube: Queensway on the north side (then a 10-minute walk south 
through the park) or High Street Kensington on the southwest side (then a 10-minute 
walk through the park). Admission: £13 ($21) adults, £11 ($18) seniors and students, 
£6.25 ($10) children 5–15, £34 ($56) families (2 adults and 2 children). Open: Daily 
10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 5 p.m.). Wheelchair accessible, despite some stairs; 
call first.
Fountain for Diana
The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain is Hyde Park’s newest attraction. 
Made of Cornish granite, the fountain aims to reflect Diana’s life through its design. 
From its highest point, water flows in two directions, falling in cascades, swirls, and 
bubbles before meeting in a calm pool at the bottom. Three bridges where you can 
cross the water and go right to the heart of the fountain are meant to reflect Diana’s 
openness.
Ironically, the fountain was plagued with problems after it was opened by the queen in 
2004. Visitors slipped on the granite and at one point the fountain malfunctioned and 
flooded Hyde Park. It’s now functioning properly and open daily from 10 a.m. 
Knightsbridge is the nearest Tube stop. Diana fans will also want to visit the new Diana, 
fashion and style exhibit at Kensington Palace.

Leicester Square
Leicester Square
Leicester (pronounced les-ter) Square is a crowded place with a big-city 
buzz. Mimes, singers, and street entertainers of all kinds vie for attention. 
Once a dueling ground, the square is now a pedestrian zone and the heart 
of West End entertainment. A half-price ticket booth (see Chapter 15) for 
theater, opera, and dance is located at the south end of the square. In the 
square’s center, surrounded by movie theaters and restaurants, is 
Leicester Square Gardens, a small grassy park with four corner gates 
named for William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, John Hunter, and Sir 
Isaac Newton, all of whom once lived or worked in the area, and statues 
of William Shakespeare and Charlie Chaplin, a bow to theater and cinema. 
You probably won’t want to linger long, but just walking through the 
square can be fun. If you’re traveling with children, keep in mind this area 
is one place with a restroom (coin-operated).
See map p. 186. Tube: Leicester Square (take the Leicester Square exit, and you’re 
in the pedestrian-only zone that leads to the square).
 London Eye
South Bank
As a piece of fast-track engineering, the 400-foot-high London Eye observa-
tion wheel is impressive. Each glass-sided elliptical module (called a 
“pod”) holds about 25 passengers, with enough space so you can move 
about freely. Although most people stand the entire time, you can sit on 
the available bench if you prefer. Lasting about 30 minutes (equivalent to 
one rotation), the ride (or flight, as they call it) is remarkably smooth — 
even on windy days riders don’t feel any nerve-twittering shakes. As long 
as the weather is good, the wheel provides unrivaled views of London.
 
 For the London Eye, you may want to reserve your place (with a specific 
entry time) before you arrive; if you’re ticketless, you can line up for a 
ticket at the office right behind the wheel, but you may have to wait an 
hour or more before you can get on the wheel. Special combination tickets 
will save your money, if you book a flight on the Eye with a London river 
cruise, Madame Tussauds, London Dungeon, or Sealife London Aquarium.

varies seasonally (Jan–Apr and Oct–Dec 8 p.m.; May–June and Sept 9 p.m.; July–
Aug 9:30 p.m.).
 London Zoo
Marylebone
The 15-hectare (36-acre) London Zoo is Britain’s largest, and has recently 
created a series of new habitats and exhibits. The best attractions are 

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 197
B.U.G.S. (insects of every description), Gorilla Kingdom (with a colony of 
Western lowland gorillas), the Clore Rainforest Lookout (South American 
monkeys, birds, and vertebrates), Komodo Dragons, and Into Africa 
(zebras, giraffes, okapi, red river hogs). The new Animal Adventure 
Children’s Zoo, with interactive exhibits placed at low height, is designed 
for 4- to 8-year-olds; also newly opened in 2009 is the Blackburn Pavilion, 
a tropical bird walk-through. Many families budget almost an entire day 
for the zoo; I recommend that you give it at least three hours.
 
 A fun way to arrive at the London Zoo is by water. The London Waterbus 
Co. (% 020/7482-2660; www.londonwaterbus.com) operates single and 
return trips in snug, converted canal boats along the Regent’s Canal, from 
Warwick Crescent in Little Venice to Camden Lock Market. Take the Tube 
to Warwick Avenue and walk south across Regent’s Canal, and then you 
can see the moorings. Trips to the waterbus’s private dock within the zoo 
depart daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The one-way fare, including zoo admission, 
costs £19 ($31) adults, £18 ($30) seniors, and £16 ($26) children.
See map p. 186. At the north end of Regent’s Park, NW1. % 020/7722-3333. www.
londonzoo.co.uk. Tube: Regent’s Park (then a 30-minute walk north through the 
park; or take bus C2 from Tube north on Albany Street to Delaney Street, then a 
10-minute walk) or Camden Town (then a 12-minute walk south on Parkway, follow-
ing the signs). Admission: £17 ($28) adults; £15 ($25) seniors, students, and visitors 
with disabilities £13 ($21) children 3–15; £54 ($89) families (2 adults and 2 children). 
Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (Sept–Oct until 5:30 p.m., Nov–Feb until 4 p.m.).
 Madame Tussauds
Marylebone
Madame Tussauds wax museum is a world-famous tourist attraction and 
a fun spot for older kids. The question is: Do you want to pay the exorbi-
tant admission and devote time to see a collection of lifelike figures? (If 
you do go in, you need at least two hours to see everything.) The original 
moldings of members of the French court, to whom Madame Tussaud had 
direct access (literally, because she made molds of their heads after they 
were guillotined during the French Revolution), are undeniably fascinat-
ing. And animatronic gadgetry makes the Spirit of London theme ride fun. 
But Chamber Live (formerly called the Chamber of Horrors) is definitely 
for the ghoulish and unsuitable for children 11 and under. The Blush 
exhibit features screen faves like Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, and Daniel 
Radcliffe of the Harry Potter movies. Next door, the former London 
Planetarium has been remade into the Stardome and now features a special-
effects show about the stars on Earth rather than those in the heavens.
 
 Go early to beat the crowds; better still, reserve tickets one day in 
advance, and go straight to the head of the line. You can order tickets by 
phone or online.

 National Gallery
St. James’s
If you’re passionate about great art, you’ll think that the National Gallery 
is paradise. This museum houses one of the world’s most comprehensive 
collections of British and European paintings. All the major schools from 
the 13th century to the 20th century are represented, but the Italians get 
the lion’s share of wall space, with works by artists such as Botticelli, 
Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael. The French Impressionist and post-
Impressionist works by Cézanne, Degas, Manet, Monet, Seurat, and van 
Gogh are splendid. And because you’re on English soil, check out at least 
a few of Turner’s stunning seascapes, Constable’s landscapes, and 
Reynolds’s society portraits. And you won’t want to miss the Rembrandts. 
Budget at least two hours to enjoy the gallery. The second floor has a 
good restaurant for lunch, tea, or snacks.
 
 To make the most of your time at the gallery, pick up a portable audio-tour 
guide. The guides are free but a security deposit is required.

usually around £8 ($13). Open: Thurs–Tues 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; Wed 10 a.m.–9 p.m. Closed 
Jan 1, Dec 24–26. The entire museum is wheelchair accessible.
 
 National Portrait Gallery
St. James’s
What do these people all have in common: Sir Walter Raleigh, Shakespeare 
(wearing a gold earring), Queen Elizabeth I, the Brontë sisters, Winston 
Churchill, Oscar Wilde, Noël Coward, Mick Jagger, Dame Judi Dench, and 
Princess Di? You can find portraits of them, as well as nearly every other 
famous English face, at the National Portrait Gallery. The portraits are 
arranged in chronological order. The earliest portraits are in the Tudor 
Gallery; the latest (such as Dame Helen Mirren) are on the first floor. Plan 
on spending at least two hours, but getting sidetracked here is easy, so 
you may want more time. On the top floor, the Portrait Restaurant & Bar 
looks out over the rooftops of the West End.

 Natural History Museum
South Kensington
Filled with magnificent specimens and exciting displays relating to natural 
history, this museum houses the national collections of living and fossil-
ized plants, animals, and minerals. The most popular attraction in this 
enormous Victorian Era museum is the huge Dinosaurs exhibit, with 14 
complete skeletons, two creepy animatronic raptors, and a full-size, 
robotic T. rex guarding a fresh kill. Kids also love the bug-filled Creepy 
Crawlies. The sparkling gems and crystals in the Mineral Gallery literally 
dazzle, and in the Meteorite Pavilion, you can see fragments of rock that 
crashed into the Earth from the farthest reaches of the galaxy. The intrigu-
ing Darwin Centre showcases the private collection of Charles Darwin, 
father of evolutionary theory, and houses the museum’s huge collection 
of preserved specimens. The museum offers enough to keep you occupied 
for at least two hours.

Nearly all the galleries are flat or ramped for wheelchair users; call for instructions 
on entering the building.
 Piccadilly Circus
Piccadilly Circus
Nearly everyone who visits London wants to see Piccadilly Circus, which 
marks the beginning of the West End. Piccadilly Circus, along with neigh-
boring Leicester Square, is London’s equivalent to New York’s Times 
Square. Around the landmark statue of Eros, jostling crowds pack the 
pavements, and an international group of teens heads for the Pepsi 
Trocadero, the area’s mega-entertainment center (see “Activities for 
teens,” later in this chapter). Regent Street, at the west side of the Circus, 
and Piccadilly, at the south end, are major shopping streets (see Chapter 
12). Piccadilly, traditionally the western road out of London, was named 
for the picadil, a ruffled collar created by a 17th-century tailor named 
Robert Baker.
See map p. 186. Tube: Piccadilly Circus.
 Science Museum
South Kensington
The Science Museum is a popular tourist attraction that showcases the 
history and development of science, medicine, and technology. The fasci-
nating displays include the Apollo 10 space module, an 1813 steam loco-
motive, Fox Talbot’s first camera, and Edison’s original phonograph. The 

Part IV: Exploring London 
200
Wellcome Wing is devoted to contemporary science and has an IMAX 3D 
theater. Interactive displays tickle the brains of 7- to 12-year-olds, and the 
Garden Galleries provide construction areas, sound-and-light shows, and 
games for younger kids. Give yourself at least two hours.

St. James’s Park and Green Park
St. James’s
Henry VIII acquired these two adjoining royal parks in the early 16th cen-
tury, and today they flank Buckingham Palace. St James’s Park, the pret-
tier of the two, was landscaped in 1827 by John Nash, in a picturesque 
English style with an ornamental lake and promenades. Major ceremonial 
occasions are held in the Mall, a processional route between the palace 
and Whitehall and Horse Guards Parade. St. James’s Palace, the former 
London abode of Prince Charles and his two sons, and adjacent Clarence 
House, residence of the Queen Mum until her death in 2002 and now the 
London home of Prince Charles, are between the Mall and Pall Mall (pro-
nounced pell mell), a broad avenue running from Trafalgar Square to St. 
James’s Palace. Clarence House is now open to visitors in August and 
September (see the “Clarence House: Another royal residence” sidebar, 
earlier in this chapter).
See map p. 186. Bounded by Piccadilly to the north, Regent Street to the east, 
Birdcage Walk and Buckingham Palace Road to the south, and Grosvenor Place to

eter of St. James’s Park). Open: Daily dawn to dusk.
Green with envy
Green Park is called Green Park because it’s the only royal park without any flower 
beds. Why? A popular story has it that, one day, as Charles II was walking through the 
park with his entourage, he announced that he was going to pick a flower and give it to 
the most beautiful lady present. This lady happened to be a milkmaid and not Queen 
Catherine, his wife. The queen was livid and ordered that all flowers be removed from 
the park (a horticultural version of “Off with their heads!”).

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 201
St. Paul’s Cathedral
The City
After the Great Fire of 1666 destroyed the city’s old cathedral, the great 
architect Christopher Wren was called upon to design St. Paul’s, a huge 
and harmonious Renaissance-leaning-toward-baroque building (see the 
“St. Paul’s Cathedral” map on p. 202). During World War II, Nazi bombing 
raids wiped out the surrounding area but spared the cathedral, so Wren’s 
masterpiece, capped by the most-famous dome in London, rises majesti-
cally above a crowded sea of undistinguished office buildings. Grinling 
Gibbons carved the exceptionally beautiful choir stalls, the only impres-
sive artwork inside.
Christopher Wren is buried in the crypt, and his epitaph, on the floor 
below the dome, reads LECTOR, SI MONUMENTUM REQUIRIS, CIRCUMSPICE (“Reader, if 
you seek his monument, look around you”). His companions in the crypt 
include two of Britain’s famed national heroes: the duke of Wellington, 
who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, and Admiral Lord Nelson, who took 
down the French at Trafalgar during the same war. But many people want 
to see St. Paul’s simply because Lady Diana Spencer wed Prince Charles 
here in what was billed as “the fairy-tale wedding of the century.”
You can climb up to the Whispering Gallery for a bit of acoustical fun or

 Tate Britain
Pimlico
The collections of the Tate Gallery are divided between the Tate Britain 
and the Tate Modern, which opened in May 2000 and is devoted to 
International Modernism. Tate Britain retains the older (pre-20th-century) 
collections of exclusively British art, plus works by major British stars like 
David Hockney and experimental works by Brits and foreigners living in 
Britain. Among the masterpieces on display, in a host of newly refurbished 
galleries, are dreamy works by the British pre-Raphaelites, the celestial

 Tate Modern
South Bank
The former Bankside Power Station is the setting for the fabulous Tate 
Modern, which opened in May 2000. Considered one of the top modern art 
museums in the world, it houses the Tate’s collection of international 
20th-century art, displaying major works by some of the most influential 
artists of this century: Frances Bacon, Salvador Dalí, Marcel Duchamp, 
Henri Matisse, Henry Moore, and Pablo Picasso among them. A gallery for 
the 21st-century collection exhibits contemporary art. Fans of contempo-
rary art and architecture shouldn’t miss this star on the London art scene. 
Plan on spending at least two hours. The museum is now linked to St. 
Paul’s Cathedral by the pedestrian-only Millennium Bridge, designed by 
Lord Norman Foster.

 Tower of London
The City
The Tower of London offers enough to keep you captivated for a good 
three to four hours, but make sure that you save time for the Crown 
Jewels, which include the largest diamond in the world (the 530-carat Star 
of Africa) and other breathtaking gems set into royal robes, swords, scep-
ters, and crowns.
The Tower of London (see the “Tower of London” map on p. 204) is the 
city’s best-known and oldest historic site. In 1066, William the Conqueror 
built the tower, which served as his fortress and later as a prison, holding 
famous captives such as Sir Walter Raleigh and Princess (later Queen) 
Elizabeth I. Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard (two of the eight wives of 
Inter-Tate travel
From Millbank Pier, on the river just outside Tate Britain, a ferry service links the Tate 
Britain and the Tate Modern. The Tate Boat makes the run between Millbank Pier and 
Bankside Pier, with one additional stop at Waterloo Pier (the stop for the London Eye), 
every 30 minutes during gallery opening hours. A one-way fare costs £5 ($8.25) for 
adults; if you have a Travelcard, you get one-third off the price. For more information, 
contact Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk).

Henry VIII), the nine-day queen Lady Jane Grey, and Sir Thomas More 
were among those unlucky souls who got their heads chopped off on 
Tower Green. According to Shakespeare, the two little princes (the sons 
of Edward IV) were murdered in the Bloody Tower by henchmen of 
Richard III — but the story is controversial among modern historians.
 
 In the bad old days, important prisoners often arrived at the tower by 
boat. You can, too. City Cruises (% 020/7740-0400; www.citycruises.
com) makes the journey to the Tower of London from Westminster Pier 
approximately every 40 minutes, from 10:10 a.m. to 5:50 p.m., for £6.90 
($11) adults and £3.45 ($5.70) children.

Wheelchair access onto the grounds is available, but many of the historic buildings

Trafalgar Square
St. James’s
Until very recently, Trafalgar Square was an island in the midst of a roar-
ingly busy traffic interchange surrounded by historic buildings, such as 
St. Martin-in-the-Fields church and the National Gallery. Then, after a 
major urban redesign, it reopened in 2003 with one side attached to the 
steps of the National Gallery, so visitors can easily get to the square with-
out crossing any streets at all. Besides being a major tourist attraction, 
Trafalgar Square is the site of many large gatherings, such as political 
demonstrations and holiday celebrations. The square honors military 
hero Horatio Viscount Nelson (1758–1805), who lost his life at the 1805 
Battle of Trafalgar against the French. Nelson’s Column, with fountains 
and four bronze lions at its base, rises 145 feet above the square. At the 
Birds, Beefeaters, and the 
Ceremony of the Keys
Huge black ravens hop around the grounds of the Tower of London. An old legend says 
that the British Commonwealth will end when the ravens leave the tower. Their wings 
have been clipped as a precaution, and in 2006, during the avian flu scare, the Tower 
ravens were put in quarantine. The ancient, all-male order of Yeomen Warders, more 
familiarly known as the Beefeaters, installed its first woman member in 2006.
You can attend the nightly Ceremony of the Keys, the ceremonial locking-up of the 
Tower by the Yeoman Warders. For free tickets, write to the Ceremony of the Keys, 
Queen’s House, HM Tower of London, London EC3N 4AB, and request a specific date, 
but also list three alternate dates. At least six weeks’ notice is required. You must enclose 
an International Reply Coupon and a self-addressed stamped envelope (British stamps 
only), or two International Reply Coupons with all requests and list the names and 
addresses of all visitors. If you have a ticket, a Yeoman Warder will admit you at 9:35 p.m.

top, a 4-meter-high (14 ft.) statue of Nelson (5'4" tall in real life) looks com-
mandingly toward Admiralty Arch, passed through by state and royal 
processions between Buckingham Palace and St. Paul’s Cathedral. You 
don’t need more than a few minutes to take in the square, but it’s also a 
fun spot to take a break and do some people-watching.
The neoclassical church on the northeast corner of Trafalgar Square was 
the precursor for dozens of similar-looking churches throughout colonial 
New England. Designed by James Gibbs, a disciple of Christopher Wren, 
St. Martin-in-the-Fields (see map on p. 186; % 020/7930-0089) was com-
pleted in 1726; the 185-foot spire was added about 100 years later. The 
Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, a famous music ensemble, frequently 
performs here. Free lunchtime concerts are held on Monday, Tuesday, 
and Friday at 1 p.m.; evening concerts are held Thursday through Saturday 
at 7:30 p.m. and cost £6 to £25 ($9.90–$41). For reservations by credit 
card, call % 020/7839-8362. The church is open Monday through 
Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.; admission is free.
 Café in the Crypt (% 020/7839-4342), one of the West End’s most pleas-
ant restaurants, is in the crypt of St. Martin-in-the-Fields (see Chapter 10 
for restaurant review). The busy crypt, which has a new entrance to one 
side of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, also contains the London Brass Rubbing 
Centre (% 020/7437-6023), which provides paper, metallic waxes, and 
instructions on how to rub your own replica of historic brasses. Prices 
range from £5 to £20 ($8.25–$33). This activity is a great diversion for 
children 10 and up. The center is open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.
See map p. 186. Bounded on the north by Trafalgar, on the west by Cockspur Street, 
and on the east by Whitehall. Tube: Charing Cross (the Underground station has an 
exit to the square).
 
 Victoria and Albert Museum
South Kensington
The Victoria and Albert (known as the V&A) is the national museum of art 
and design. In its 145 galleries, filled with fine and decorative arts from 
around the world, you find superbly decorated period rooms, a fashion 
collection spanning 400 years of European designs, Raphael’s designs for 
tapestries in the Sistine Chapel, the Silver Galleries, and the largest assem-
blages of Renaissance sculpture outside Italy and of Indian art outside 
India. The Canon Photography Gallery shows works by celebrated photog-
raphers. In November 2001, the museum opened its spectacular new 
British Galleries. Allow at least two hours just to cover the basics.
See map p. 186. Cromwell Road, SW7. % 020/7942-2000. www.vam.ac.uk. Tube: 
South Kensington (the museum is across from the Underground station). Admission: 
Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5:45 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Wed). Closed Dec 24–26. The museum 
is wheelchair accessible (only about 5 percent of the exhibits include steps).

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 207
 Westminster Abbey
Westminster
Gothic and grand, Westminster Abbey (see the “Westminster Abbey” map 
on p. 208) is one of London’s most important historic sites. The present 
abbey dates mostly from the 13th and 14th centuries, but a church has 
been on this site for more than a thousand years. Since 1066, when William 
the Conqueror became the first English monarch to be crowned here, 
every successive British sovereign except for two (Edward V and Edward 
VIII) has sat on the Coronation Chair to receive the crown and scepter. In 
the Royal Chapels, you can see the chapel of Henry VII, with its delicate 
fan vaulting, and the tomb of Queen Elizabeth I, who was buried in the 
same vault as her Catholic half-sister, Mary I, and not far from her rival, 
Mary, Queen of Scots. In Poets’ Corner, some of England’s greatest writers 
(including Geoffrey Chaucer, Charles Dickens, and Thomas Hardy) are 
interred or memorialized. Other points of interest include the College 
Garden, cloisters, chapter house, and the Undercroft Museum, which con-
tains the Pyx Chamber, with its display of church plate (the silver owned 
by the church). In September 1997, the abbey served as the site of Princess 
Diana’s funeral, and in 2002, the funeral service for the Queen Mother was 
held here. The abbey is within walking distance of the Houses of 
Parliament. Once you’re inside, give yourself about 30 minutes to see 
everything.
See map p. 186. Broad Sanctuary, SW1. % 020/7654-4834. www.westminster-
abbey.org. Tube: Westminster (then a 3-minute walk west following Parliament 
Square to Broad Sanctuary). Bus: The no. 77A going south along The Strand, 
Whitehall, and Millbank stops near the Houses of Parliament, near the Abbey. 
Admission: £15 ($25) adults; £12 ($20) seniors, students, and children 11–16; £30 ($50) 
families (2 adults and 2 children); includes audio guide. Guided tours: Led by an 
Abbey Verger £3 ($4.95) Mon–Fri 10 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11 a.m., 2 p.m., 2:30 p.m.; Sat 
10:30 a.m. and 11 a.m.; tickets for tours at Enquiry Desk in the Abbey. Open: Cathedral 
Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. (until 7 p.m. Wed), no sightseeing on Sun (services only); 
College Garden Mon–Sat 10:30 a.m.–4 p.m. You can use ramped wheelchair access 
through the Cloisters; ring the bell for assistance.
A window on Oscar Wilde’s window
In 1995, 100 years after Oscar Wilde was tried for “gross indecency” and sentenced to 
two years’ hard labor in Reading Gaol, the Church of England finally recognized his 
immortal genius with a memorial window at Westminster Abbey. But because his name 
is nowhere to be seen in the abbey, the blue window with its abstract design is the kind 
of dubious honor that would no doubt provoke a witty quip from the great playwright. 
Maybe something like, “Clear glass wasn’t good enough for me; it had to be stained.”

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
If you think you’ve “done” London because you’ve marveled at 
Westminster Abbey, seen where the queen lives, toured the Tower of 
London, and feasted your eyes on the masterpieces in the British 
Museum, think again. London is teeming with more sightseeing possibili-
ties: glorious gardens, magnificent mansions, singular museums, ancient 
corners, historic churches, and many themed attractions that fill you in

on the history and flavor of majestic London Town. In the following sec-
tions, I highlight a few more of the many activities that may tickle your 
fancy and organize them by categories of interest. (For locations, see the 
“More London Sights” map on p. 210.)
In the following sections, I also cover four major attractions just outside 
Central London and easily accessible by Tube or train — Hampstead 
Heath, Hampton Court Palace, the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and 
Windsor Castle. You can spend the better part of a day visiting any one 
of these sights — all are well worth your time — before returning to 
Central London in time for a play or concert in the evening.
The following sights are fully or partially wheelchair accessible; visitors 
with disabilities should call the attraction to find out about special 
entrances, ramps, and elevator locations:
 
✓ Bank of England Museum
 
✓ British Library Exhibition Galleries
 
✓ Chelsea Physic Garden
 
✓ Courtauld Gallery
 
✓ Design Museum
 
✓ Hampton Court
 
✓ Imperial War Museum
 
✓ London Dungeon
 
✓ London Transport Museum
 
✓ Museum of Childhood
 
✓ Museum of London
 
✓ Regent’s Park
 
✓ Royal Academy of Arts
 
✓ Royal Botanic Gardens (Kew Gardens)
 
✓ Sealife London Aquarium
 
✓ Tower Bridge Experience
 
✓ Wallace Collection
Sights for history buffs
You can’t escape history in London. The past is woven into the very 
fabric of the city, and it’s why many visitors want to come here. The 
history contained in the sights in this section is as old as Rome, as new 
as the current prime minister, and as dramatic as the events of World 
War II.

 Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms
Westminster
You can almost hear the air-raid sirens. In this 21-room underground 
bunker, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his War Cabinet planned 
out the military campaigns of World War II. The site has been meticulously 
preserved, right down to the nightshirt and cigar waiting by Churchill’s 
bed. The Churchill Museum, dedicated to the life of Sir Winston Churchill, 
is a permanent exhibition within the Cabinet War Rooms. Give yourself at 
least an hour to explore the site.
See map p. 210. Clive Steps, King Charles Street, SW1. % 020/7930-6961. http://
cwr.iwm.org.uk. Tube: Westminster (then a 10-minute walk west, staying on the 
north side of the street, to Parliament Street; turn right to reach King Charles Street). 
Admission: £13 ($21) adults, £11 ($18) seniors and students, free for children 15 and 
under; a free self-guided audio tour comes with your ticket. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–
6 p.m. (last admission 5 p.m.). Closed Dec 24–26.
Imperial War Museum
Lambeth
The former insane asylum known as Bedlam is now devoted to the insan-
ity of war. You can see a wide range of weapons and historic equipment, 
including a Battle of Britain Spitfire, a German one-man submarine, a Mark 
V tank, and a rifle once carried by Lawrence of Arabia. Other exhibits 
include coded messages, forged documents, espionage equipment from 
World War I to the present, and multimedia presentations about the Blitz 
and trench warfare. The Holocaust Gallery documents one of history’s 
darkest episodes through film, photos, and artifacts, many shown for the 
first time. Enough history is on display to keep you occupied for a couple 
of hours.
See map p. 210. Lambeth Road, SE1. % 020/7416-5320. www.iwm.org.uk. Tube: 
Lambeth North (then a 10-minute walk south on Kennington, south of Westminster 
Bridge Road, and east on Lambeth Road). Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. 
Closed Dec 24–26.
 
 Museum of London
The City
The Museum of London is the most comprehensive city museum any-
where in the world. Located in the original square-mile Londinium of the 
Romans and overlooking the city’s Roman and medieval walls, the 
museum includes archaeological finds; paintings and prints; social, indus-
trial, and historical artifacts; and costumes, maps, and models to recount 
the city’s history from prehistoric times to today. Of special interest is the 
gilt-and-scarlet Lord Mayor’s Coach, built in 1757 and weighing 3 tons. A 
major new expansion of the ground-floor galleries (which span the centu-
ries from the Great Fire of 1666 to modern multicultural London) got 

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 213
under way in 2007 and won’t be completed until 2010. Give yourself at 
least an hour to skim through the engaging collections.
See map p. 210. 150 London Wall (in the Barbican district near St. Paul’s Cathedral), 
EC2. % 0870/444-3853. www.museumoflondon.org.uk. Tube: St. Paul’s 
(then a 10-minute walk north on St. Martin Le Grand and Aldersgate). Admission: 
Free. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5:50 p.m.; Sun noon to 5:50 p.m. Closed Dec 24–26 and 
Jan 1.
10 Downing Street
St. James’s
The prime minister’s residence is a place on many visitors’ “must-see” 
lists, so I’m sorry to tell you that there’s nothing to see except a heavily 
guarded gate. By peering through the gate, you can get a glimpse, on the 
right side, of No. 10, the official residence of the British PM since 1732. In 
2007, the sizeable Blair family (Tony, Cherie, and four kids) moved out and 
the new prime minister, Gordon Brown, moved in. The chancellor of the 
exchequer resides at No. 11, and No. 12 serves as the office of the chief 
government whip, responsible for maintaining discipline and cooperation 
in the vociferous House of Commons. These three small brick terrace 
houses, built on a cul-de-sac in 1680, stand in sharp contrast to the enor-
mous 19th-century offices lining Whitehall, the government quarter 
around Downing Street.
See map p. 210. 10 Downing St., SW1. Tube: Westminster (then a 5-minute walk north 
on Parliament Street and Whitehall).
Attractions for art lovers
In addition to visiting the great art museums described in “London’s Top 
Sights,” earlier in this chapter, you may want to check out some of the 
city’s smaller galleries.
Royal Academy of Arts
St. James’s
Housed in 18th-century Burlington House, the site of Britain’s first art 
school, the Royal Academy presents major exhibits throughout the year 
and mounts a renowned (and usually jampacked) Summer Exhibition 
of juried works from around the United Kingdom. Give yourself about 
an hour.
See map p. 210. Burlington House, Piccadilly, W1. % 020/7300-8000. www.royal
academy.org.uk. Tube: Piccadilly Circus (then a 5-minute walk down Piccadilly; 
the Academy is on the north side of the street just before the Burlington Arcade). 
Admission: Varies according to exhibit but usually £10 ($17) adults, £8 ($13) seniors, 
£4 ($6.60) children. Open: Sat–Thurs 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 5:30 p.m.); Fri 
10 a.m.–10 p.m.

Part IV: Exploring London

Saatchi Gallery
Chelsea
Ex-adman Charles Saatchi has amassed one of the world’s largest indepen-
dent collections of contemporary British and international art. His 
gallery shows pieces from the permanent collection, as well as changing 
international exhibits. Regardless of what you think of the sometimes 
The sinkable Gordon Brown?
Of course, London gossip swirls around 10 Downing Street, just as it does around 
Buckingham Palace. After Tony Blair’s position on the Iraq War cost his New Labour 
Party one-third of their seats in 2005, he announced that he would not run for a fourth 
term, and in 2007 he stepped down and handed over the reins of power to Gordon 
Brown, a Scotsman who had served as Blair’s chancellor of the exchequer. Unlike the 
voluble Blair, Brown is something of an enigma to the British public and so unpopular 
that no one knows how long his crisis-ridden government will last. By the time you read 
this, he may be out of office. The new prime minister is married to Sarah Macauley, a 
public relations executive, and has two sons, one of whom was diagnosed in 2006 with 
cystic fibrosis. Born in 1951 in Glasgow, Brown earned a PhD in history at the University 
of Edinburgh (and is only one of four prime ministers not to attend Oxford University or 
Cambridge University). During a school rugby match, he was kicked in the head and 
suffered a detached retina that left him blind in his left eye. Later, the same symptoms 
threatened the vision in his right eye, but several surgeries saved his sight. After work-
ing as a lecturer in politics and as a journalist, Brown was elected to Parliament in 1983. 
After the sudden death of Labour leader John Smith, in 1994, Brown was regarded as a 
potential party leader, but he didn’t contest the leadership when Tony Blair became the 
favorite.
It has long been rumored that a deal was struck between Blair and Brown in which Blair 
promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing 
against him in the leadership election. In public, the two remained mostly united, but 
there have been many reports of serious rifts between them.
Although Prime Minister Brown has been careful not to make any changes in key areas 
of Blair’s New Labour social policy or make any radical changes in New Labour itself, 
he has never caught on with the British public and is currently weathering (or not) a 
Parliament-wide financial crisis that reached crisis proportions in May 2009, when it 
was revealed that Members of Parliament in both parties were routinely using their 
public expense allotments for personal financial gain. One MP used taxpayer money to 
have the moat of his castle cleaned; other MPs were involved in real-estate profiteer-
ing. In a time of recession and economic hardship, these shenanigans haven’t gone 
over well with the British taxpayers, and Gordon Brown has been seen less as a leader 
and more as a lackey to an entrenched political system that, in 2009, seemed on the 
verge of complete collapse. Stay tuned for further developments.

controversial works on display — many of them vapid, self-serving, and 
silly — the gallery remains a showcase for the art trends of the second. In 
2008, the gallery moved to a new location, the historic Duke of York’s HQ 
in Chelsea. There’s a savvy cafe on the premises, as well as a bookstore. 
Give yourself about an hour to check out the art.

 Somerset House
The Strand
The late Queen Mother once remarked how sad it was that the courtyard 
at Somerset House had become an Inland Revenue car park. It was just the 
spur that the long-running campaign needed to open up the 1,000-room 
civil service palace, designed by Sir William Chambers (1724–96), to the 
public. The government moved its workers out, and the Heritage Lottery 
Fund coughed up the millions needed to restore the neoclassical build-
ings, the courtyard with its dancing fountains (which become an ice-rink 
in winter), and the river terrace (daily 8 a.m.–10 p.m., weather permitting) 
that’s now the home of a great summer cafe. A heady mix of high culture 
and street entertainment, the “new” Somerset House is home to the note-
worthy and often overlooked Courtauld Gallery and two additional 
Embankment Galleries, which are used for temporary exhibitions. 
 
 The Courtauld Gallery (% 020/7848-2526) has been in Somerset House 
since 1989. Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings are still the 
gallery’s main strength. Major works include Manet’s Bar at the Folies 
Bergères; Monet’s Banks of the Seine at Argenteuil; Lady with Parasol, by 
Degas; La Loge, by Renoir; Van Gogh’s Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear; and 
several Cézannes, including The Card Players. But you’ll find work by most 
great names (many by Rubens), right up to modern greats Ben Nicholson, 
Graham Sutherland, and Larry Rivers. Budget at least an hour to see 
everything.

 Wallace Collection
Marylebone
The palatial town house of the late Lady Wallace is the setting for a spec-
tacular collection of art, ornaments, and armaments. You can enjoy out-
standing French works by the likes of Watteau and Fragonard, as well as 
masterpieces from the Dutch (Frans Hals and Rembrandt), English,

Literary landmarks
Writers have been drawn to London for centuries and have left their lit-
erary imprints all over this vast metropolis. Listed in this section are 
some of the unique places associated with writers who lived in London, 
as well as one of the world’s great storehouses of literary treasures.
 
 British Library Exhibition Centre
Marylebone
The venerable British Library moved to this new building in 1998 and 
displays some of the world’s most famous books, maps, manuscripts, and 
documents in a series of special galleries. This is where you can see a 
copy of the Magna Carta, Shakespeare’s first folio, and handwritten manu-
scripts by authors such as Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, and Thomas 
Hardy. Just as fascinating are the audio recordings that let you hear the 
voices of Virginia Woolf and William Butler Yeats among others reading 
from their own works. Give this sight at least an hour; allow more time if 
you love literature or literary history.

8 p.m. Tues); Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
Carlyle’s House
Chelsea
Thomas Carlyle (author of The French Revolution and many other rarely 
read books) and his witty wife, Jane (a noted letter writer), lived in this 
pretty 1708 Queen Anne terrace house from 1834 to 1881. Furnished as it 
was during their residence, the house is an accurate representation of 
middle-class Victorian domestic life. Carlyle’s “soundproof” study in the 
sky-lit attic is filled with memorabilia — his books, a letter from Benjamin 
Disraeli, personal effects, a writing chair, and even his death mask. You 
can browse through the house in about a half-hour.

The Charles Dickens Museum
Bloomsbury
Charles Dickens lived in many places, but he and his family called this 
Bloomsbury house home from 1837 to 1839. Here, the great author penned 
The Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist, and Nicholas Nickleby, the poignant and 
famous portrayals of life in Victorian England. The museum contains the 
world’s most comprehensive Dickens library, portraits, illustrations, and 
rooms furnished exactly as they were in Dickens’ time. You can see every-
thing in a half-hour, but allow more time if you’re a Dickens fanatic.

Dr. Johnson’s House
Holborn
Hidden away in a tiny square north of Fleet Street is the Queen Anne 
house where Dr. Samuel Johnson, best known as the lexicographer who 
compiled one of the first dictionaries of the English language, lived (quite 
humbly) from 1748 to 1759. A copy of the original dictionary is on display, 
along with Johnson memorabilia. The restored 17th-century house is 
close to Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub (see Chapter 10), a favorite haunt 
of the good doctor, who was celebrated as a storyteller of the first order. 
You can see everything on view here in less than half an hour.

Open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (until 5 p.m. Oct–Apr).
Benjamin Franklin’s London abode
A signer of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) was as 
American as they come. As a writer, he coined such famous aphorisms as “A penny 
saved is a penny earned.” Franklin was also an inventor, and St. Paul’s Cathedral in 
London was the first public building in the world to get one of his new lightning rods. As 
a statesman, Franklin resided in London between 1757 and 1775, and his “genteel lodg-
ings,” on Craven Street near Charing Cross Station, served as the first de facto American 
embassy after Independence. The Benjamin Franklin House (see map on p. 210; 36 
Craven St., WC2N; % 020/7930-9121), the only Franklin house remaining in the world 
today, opened to the public in 2006 (the 300th anniversary of Franklin’s birth). On 
Monday, there are guided tours (£3.50/$5.80) at noon, 1 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3:15 p.m.; 
Wednesday through Sunday you can visit and poke around at your own pace (£7/$12 
adults, free for children 15 and under). You can find more information and book a tour 
online at www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org.

All manner of intriguing museums
London’s museums are surprisingly varied in their scope and substance. 
In addition to all the great art museums that you can read about in the 
“Attractions for art lovers” section, earlier in this chapter, the city has 
museums dedicated to architecture, design, transportation, medicine, 
and money.
Bank of England Museum
The City
Devoted capitalists enjoy the Bank of England Museum, housed in the 
enormous Bank of England building. The museum chronicles changes in 
the banking industry since the Bank of England’s beginnings in 1694, when 
funds were needed to finance the war against France’s Louis XIV. On dis-
play are documents from famous customers (including George 
Washington), gold bullion, bank notes (forged and real), and coins. 
Interactive video displays present information about today’s high-tech 
world of finance and a reconstructed 18th-century Banking Hall. You can 
see it all in less than an hour.
See map p. 210. Bartholomew Lane, EC2. % 020/7601-5545. www.bankof
england.co.uk. Tube: Bank (then a 5-minute walk east on Threadneedle Street; 
turn left on Bartholomew’s Lane for the museum entrance). Admission: Free. Open: 
Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Dennis Seavers’ House, 18 Folgate Street
Spitalfields
An extraordinary experience awaits those who cross the threshold of this 
1742 house near Spitalfields Market. Over 20 years ago, an eccentric 
American artist named Dennis Seavers painstakingly re-created the origi-
nal interiors, adding period accoutrements and turning the house into a 
unique sensory experience. Visitors are not allowed to speak (or use 
mobile phones) once they enter and are to imagine that the house is still 
inhabited by a family of French Huguenot silk weavers. The house is lit 
only by natural light and candlelight. Smell and sound is part of the experi-
ence. For maximum effect, reserve for one of the Monday evening candlelit 
tours. Allow at least 30 minutes for your visit.

vation required; Mon lunchtime £5 ($8.25), Sun £8 ($13). Open: Sun noon to 4 p.m., first 
and third Mon of every month noon to 2 p.m.; every Mon night, hours vary with light 
of the seasons. 
Design Museum

affects our everyday lives — check out this museum in the hot “new” 

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 219
Butler’s Wharf area east of Tower Bridge. You can find classical, kitsch, 
modern, surreal, and innovative — from Corbusier chairs to the Coke 
bottle — all chronicled here. Plus, you get to see some great river views. 
Plan to spend at least an hour.

£8.50 ($14) adults, £6.50 ($11) seniors, children 11 and under free. Open: Daily 10 
a.m.–5:45 p.m.
Geffrye Museum
Shoreditch
The Geffrye is one of London’s most interesting and charming small muse-
ums, but it’s off the beaten tourist track in East London and consequently 
overlooked by many visitors. In a chronological sequence of meticulously 
re-created period rooms, the museum displays the furniture and domestic 
interiors of the urban middle classes in London from Tudor times up to 
the present day. Each room has an audio component that allows you to 
hear extracts of books, newspapers, or letters written during the period. 
Set in beautiful 18th-century buildings that were once the almshouses of 
the Ironmongers’ Company, the museum has a nice cafe for lunch or tea. 
Allow about an hour to see everything.
Kingsland Road (just north of Old Street), Shoreditch, E2. % 020/7739-9893. www.
geffrye-museum.org.uk. Tube: Old Street (then a 10-minute walk east along 
Old Street and north on Kingsland Road). Admission: Free. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–
5:45 p.m.; Sun noon to 5 p.m.
Old Operating Theatre Museum & Herb Garret
South Bank
The Old Operating Theatre isn’t for the faint of heart. The roof garret of 
the church of St. Thomas, once attached to St. Thomas’s Hospital, con-
tains Britain’s oldest operating theater (from 1822), where students could 
witness surgical procedures on poor (literally and figuratively) patients. 
You’ll shudder over the collection of mid-19th-century “cutting-edge” 
medical instruments, including amputation saws. The theater was in use 
long before the advent of anesthesia in 1846. Prior to that time, if a patient 
had a limb amputated, only a blindfold and a bottle of liquor were pro-
vided (and you thought your healthcare was bad). The herb garret was 
used for the storage and curing of medicinal herbs. Give yourself about 30 
minutes for your visit.

under. Open: Daily 10:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Dec 15–Jan 5.

 Sir John Soane’s Museum
Holborn
The house of Sir John Soane (1753–1837), architect of the Bank of England, 
is an eccentric cache of ancient sculpture, artifacts, and art, mixed in with 
odd architectural perspectives, fool-the-eye mirrors, flying arches, and 
domes. This captivating Holborn attraction is rarely crowded, which 
makes spending an hour even more of a treat. The oldest piece in the 
house is the 3,300-year-old sarcophagus of Pharaoh Seti I. Top prize in the 
picture gallery goes to William Hogarth’s satirical and sometimes bawdy 
series from The Rake’s Progress. On the first Tuesday of every month, the 
house is open in the evening and illuminated by candlelight; this event is 
very popular and you need to arrive early because only a limited number 
of tickets are issued. Allow about 45 minutes for your visit.

Tube: Holborn (then a 5-minute walk south on Kingsway to Lincoln’s Inn Fields; the 
museum entrance is on the north side of the street). Admission: Free (£5/$8.25 on first 
Tues evening of each month); guided tours £5 ($8.25). Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; 
first Tues of every month 6–9 p.m.; guided tours Sat 11 a.m.
Activities for teens
 If you have teens in tow, you may wonder where to take them so that they 
won’t feel as though their interests are being completely ignored. The 
choices in this section — all places where local London teens hang out — 
provide a few screams, a wonderland of games, and some really loud music.
London Dungeon
South Bank
Don’t bring young children here unless you want to pay for therapy, but 
teens seem to love the grisly re-creations of medieval torture and execu-
tions presented at this house of horrors. You find a scream (literally) 
around every corner. Amid the tolling bells, dripping water, and caged 
rats, you can face Jack the Ripper or witness a simulated burning at the 
stake. It’s ghoulishly expensive, but some think it’s more fun than Madame 
Tussauds. Prices vary according to date and time of entry; you’ll save by 
booking online. You can see everything in about an hour.

Oct–Mar daily 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (last admission 4:30 p.m.). Closed Dec 25.
Pepsi Trocadero
Piccadilly Circus
This “total entertainment complex” is right on Piccadilly Circus and will 
seem unbearably loud, crowded, and cheesy to anyone over 30. The lead 

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 221
attraction is Segaworld, which offers various rides, including Max Drop, 
the world’s first indoor freefall ride (don’t eat for at least an hour before), 
and 400 ear-splitting, eye-popping video games and simulators. Theme 
restaurants include the ersatz Rainforest Cafe (which doesn’t pretend its 
proceeds go to support the rain forests and has what may be the worst 
food in London) and the 1950s-style Ed’s Easy Diner (see my review in 
Chapter 10). Plan to spend some time, because the Pepsi Trocadero is 
designed and packaged in such a way that after you’re in, finding your way 
out again seems to take forever.
See map p. 210. Piccadilly Circus. % 09068/881100. Tube: Piccadilly Circus (then

10 a.m.–1 a.m.
Places that please kids
 The little(r) ones probably won’t have much interest in London’s art 
museums and historic buildings. But the city offers all kinds of diversions 
for preteens, including a museum crammed with antique toys and attrac-
tions related to the sea, the stars, and the subway (Tube).
 
 London Transport Museum
Covent Garden
Housed in a splendid Victorian building (once the Flower Market at Covent 
Garden) that recently received a complete interior overhaul, this museum 
chronicles the development of the city’s famous Underground and double-
decker red-bus system. A fabulous collection of historic vehicles, includ-
ing a horse-drawn bus and London’s first trolley bus, are on display. 
Several KidZones offer interactive exhibits that enable younger visitors to 
operate the controls of a Tube train, get their tickets punched, and play 
with touch-screen technology. Allow two hours, and even then you may 
have to drag them away.

Museum of Childhood
Bethnal Green
A branch of the Victoria and Albert Museum, this museum specializes in 
toys from the past and present. You can find a staggering collection of 
dolls, many with elaborate period costumes, and fully furnished doll-
houses ranging from simple cottages to miniature mansions. Optical toys, 
marionettes, puppets, tin soldiers, war toys, toy trains and aircraft, and a 
display of clothing and furniture relating to the social history of childhood 
make this museum an enchanting place to invest a couple of hours. Oh, 
how times — and toys — have changed.

Sealife London Aquarium
South Bank
London’s subterranean aquarium, located right beside the London Eye, 
may be a bit disappointing, if you’ve been to any of the great aquariums 
in North America, and the admission prices have shot up so much that 
you may want to think twice about visiting. That said, children enjoy 
observing its more than 350 species of fish and aquatic invertebrates, 
including sharks, graceful stingrays, man-eating piranhas, and sea scorpi-
ons. Exhibits, some in floor-to-ceiling tanks, re-create marine habitats 
from around the world. Plan on spending at least an hour here — more if 
you can’t pull the kids away (or you want to get your money’s worth).

To see or not to see: Shakespearean sights
If you don’t have time to visit Stratford-upon-Avon (see Chapter 14), 
where the great poet and dramatist William Shakespeare was born 
and died, you can visit two Shakespeare-associated sights on London’s 
South Bank.
Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre
South Bank
A guided tour (available year-round) of this full-size replica of 
Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre and its workshops, all located just east of 
the original site, will transport you to the days of Shakespeare and 
Elizabethan theater: what audiences were like, the rivalry among the 
theaters, the cruel bear-baiting shows, and the notorious Southwark Stews 
(a nearby area, where prostitutes plied their trade). Watching a 
Shakespeare play from one of the benches in this roofless “wooden O” is 
a memorable experience, though the hard benches can be rough on the 
backside. See Chapter 15 for details on obtaining tickets for one of 
the performances, presented mid-April through early October. The tour 
lasts about an hour.

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 223
 
 If you plan to see a Shakespeare play at the Globe, you can have a snack, 
tea, or a full meal in the theater itself. You don’t need to make reservations 
at The Globe Brasserie; it’s open daily mid-April through early October 
10 a.m. to 11 p.m., mid-October through mid-April 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Make 
reservations ahead for lunch or dinner at The Globe Restaurant (% 020/
7928-9444), open daily noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 11 p.m.
See map p. 210. New Globe Walk (just west of Southwark Bridge), SE1. % 020/7902-

along the river). Tours: £11 ($18) adults, £8.50 ($14) seniors and students, £6.50 ($11) 
children, £28 ($46) families (2 adults and 3 children). Open: Mid-Oct to mid-Apr daily 
9 a.m.–5 p.m.; mid-Apr to mid-Oct (performance season) daily 9 a.m. to noon.
Southwark Cathedral
South Bank
Chaucer and Shakespeare both worshiped at Southwark Cathedral. 
London’s second-oldest church after Westminster Abbey, Southwark 
(pronounced suth-ick) Cathedral is in what was London’s first theater dis-
trict (as well as a church-sanctioned center of prostitution). Although the 
cathedral was partially rebuilt in 1890, a great deal of history is associated 
with this 15th-century church. In under 30 minutes, you can see the entire 
site, including the Shakespeare memorial window and a 13th-century 
wooden effigy of a knight. Lunchtime concerts are regularly given on 
Monday and Tuesday; call for exact times and schedules.

Ships ahoy! Nautical London
The River Thames, London’s watery artery to the English Channel, is full 
of all kinds of watercraft. This section details two intriguing ships that 
you can visit. I also tell you about touring the Thames by boat in the 
“Seeing London by Guided Tour” section, later in this chapter.
 Golden Hinde
South Bank
A full-scale reconstruction of Sir Francis Drake’s 16th-century flagship, 
complete with a crew dressed in Tudor costumes, the Golden Hinde was 
built in Devon but launched in San Francisco, in 1973, to commemorate 
Drake’s claiming of California for Queen Elizabeth I. Like the original, this 
ship circumnavigated the globe, sailing more than 140,000 miles before 
becoming a permanent floating museum in 1996. A self-guided tour of the 
fully rigged ship, once the home to 20 officers and gentlemen and 40 to 60 
crew members, takes about a half-hour.

 H.M.S. Belfast
South Bank
The Belfast, a huge Royal Navy cruiser built in 1938 and used in World War 
II, is now moored in the Thames near London Bridge, opposite the Tower 
of London. Tours of this floating 10,500-ton museum allow visitors to see 
all seven decks. On-ship exhibits are devoted to the history of the ship and 
the Royal Navy. You and your kids can witness a re-created surface battle. 
Plan to spend about 90 minutes.

Architectural highlights and stately homes
Stepping into one of London’s great mansions, you can see what life lived 
on a grand scale was really like. The capital is also full of intriguing monu-
ments, including one called, simply, The Monument, and famous bridges, 
such as Tower Bridge, which you can visit high above the Thames.
 
 Apsley House
St. James’s
Once known as Number One London because it was the first house past 
the tollgate into London, this magnificent neoclassical mansion, designed 
by Robert Adam and built between 1771 and 1778, was the London resi-
dence of the first duke of Wellington. The last great London town house, 
Apsley contains original collections that are mostly intact. After his phe-
nomenal military career, which included defeating Napoleon at Waterloo 
in 1815, the duke was one of the most popular men in England. Apsley 
House, with its sumptuous interiors and treasure-trove of paintings, china, 
swords, and military honors, reflects the first duke’s position as the most 
powerful commander in Europe. A free audio guide explains it all on a self-
guided tour that lasts about an hour.

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 225
The Monument
The City
This 202-foot-high Doric column was designed by Sir Christopher Wren 
and commemorates the Great Fire of 1662, which allegedly began in 
nearby Pudding Lane and swept through London. The Monument is the 
tallest isolated stone column in the world — you’ll know just how tall if 
you climb the 311 steps to the viewing platform at the top. Give yourself 
at least 30 minutes for the climb and a look around at the top.
See map p. 210. Monument Street (just north of London Bridge), EC3. % 020/7626-
2717. www.themonument.info. Tube: Monument (you get out right across the 
street). Admission: £3 ($4.95) adults, £2 ($3.30) seniors and students, £1 ($1.65) chil-
dren. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (last admission 4:45 p.m.).
Spencer House
St. James’s
The late Princess Diana is probably the most famous member of the 
Spencer family, but she never lived in her family’s ancestral London home, 
built for the first Earl Spencer in 1766. The house, one of London’s most 
beautiful private palaces, hasn’t been a private residence since 1927. 
Brilliantly restored and opened as a museum in 1990, its rooms are filled 
with period furniture and art loans from Queen Elizabeth, the Tate Britain, 
and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Guided tours (the only way to see 
the place) take about an hour and are limited to groups of 20.

dents. Children 9 and under not admitted. Open: Feb–July and Sept–Dec Sun 10:30 
a.m.–4:45 p.m. Closed Jan and Aug.
Tower Bridge Exhibition
South Bank
Step inside Tower Bridge and find out why, how, and when this famous 
drawbridge, with its pinnacled towers, was built and how the mechanism 
for raising the bridge for ship traffic actually works. The spectacular views 
up and down the Thames from the bridge’s glass-enclosed walkways 
double the value of this attraction. You can see the exhibition in about 45 
minutes.

Parks and gardens
Part of London’s charm comes from its giant green parks, small neigh-
borhood squares, and special gardens. If a bucolic mood strikes, you 
may want to visit one of the lovely spots in this section.
Chelsea Physic Garden
Chelsea
Hidden behind high brick walls, the Chelsea Physic Garden is the second-
oldest surviving botanical garden in England and one of London’s most 
beautiful places. The garden, containing more than 7,000 exotic herbs, 
shrubs, trees, and flowers, plus England’s earliest rock garden, was 
founded in 1673 by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries to develop 
medicinal and commercial plant species. Cotton seeds from this garden 
launched an industry in the new colony of Georgia. The garden is small 
enough (1.5 hectares/31⁄2 acres) to wander through in less than an hour, 
but budget some more time if you love plants. Drop by the nice teahouse 
on the premises for a spot of tea.
See map p. 210. Swan Walk, 66 Royal Hospital Rd., SW3. % 020/7352-5646. www.
chelseaphysicgarden.co.uk. Tube: Sloane Square (then a 15-minute walk 
south on Lower Sloane Street and west to the end of Royal Hospital Road). Bus: 
Southbound bus no. 11, 19, or 22 from Sloane Square. Admission: £8 ($13) adults, £5 
($8.25) students and children 5–15. Open: Apr–Oct Wed–Fri and Sun noon to 5 p.m. 
(until 10 p.m. Wed July–Aug).
 Regent’s Park
Marylebone
Regent’s Park spans 162 hectares (400 acres) of green, mostly open park-
land fringed by imposing Regency terraces. The park is the home of the 
London Zoo (described under “London’s Top Sights,” earlier in this chap-
ter). People come here to play soccer, cricket, tennis, and softball; boat 
For fans of Princess Di
If you’re a true Princess Diana fan, note that she’s buried on a picturesque island on the 
Oval Lake at Althorp, the Spencer family estate in Northamptonshire. The grounds and 
part of the manor house are open each year from July through September daily 11 a.m. 
to 5 p.m., but you can view Diana’s island mausoleum from across the lake only. 
Admission costs £13 ($21) adults, £11 ($18) seniors, £6 ($9.90) children, and £30 ($50) 
families (2 adults and 2 children). The charge includes admission to the Diana Museum, 
set up by her brother, Earl Spencer. The museum contains an exhibit celebrating 
Diana’s childhood, her royal wedding (including her famous wedding gown), and her 
charitable works. You can book your tickets in advance by calling % 0870/167-9000. 
You can also buy day-of tickets at the Gate House or online at www.althorp.com.

on the lake; visit Queen Mary’s Rose Garden (which includes an outdoor 
theater — see Chapter 15); and let their kids have fun at the many play-
grounds. The park offers summer lunch and evening bandstand concerts, 
as well as puppet shows and other children’s activities on weekdays 
throughout August. The northernmost section of the park rises to the 
summit of Primrose Hill, which provides fine views of Westminster and 
the City. The restrooms by Chester Gate, on the east side of the park, offer 
facilities for persons with disabilities.
See map p. 210. Just north of Marylebone Road and surrounded by the Outer Circle 
road. % 020/7486-7905, or 020/7486-2431 for advance booking for Open Air Theatre 
(operating late May through early Sept). www.royalparks.org.uk and www.
openairtheatre.org. Tube: Regent’s Park or Baker Street (then a 5-minute 
walk north to the south end of the park). Open: Daily 5 a.m. to dusk.
 
 Royal Botanic Gardens
Kew
Located 9 miles southwest of Central London, the Royal Botanic Gardens 
at Kew — more familiarly known as Kew Gardens — are a gift to garden 
lovers. A trip to these world-famous gardens, which celebrated their 250th 
anniversary in 2009, takes the better part of a day to allow for travel time 
and garden strolling, but it’s well worth it. On display in the 121-hectare 
(300-acre) gardens is a marvelous array of specimens first planted in the 
17th and 18th centuries. Orchids and palms are nurtured in the Victorian 
glass pavilion hothouse. The site contains a lake, aquatic gardens, a 
Chinese pagoda, and even a royal palace. Kew Palace, smallest and loveli-
est of the former royal compounds, where King George III went insane and 
where Queen Charlotte died in 1818, is open from April 10 through 
September 27 (dates may vary a day or two every year). Queen Charlotte’s 
Cottage (not open to the public) served as the mad king’s summer retreat. 
An exciting new attraction, called Rhizotron and Xstrata, takes you under 
the ground and then 18m (59 ft.) up in the air, bringing you close to the 
treetops in the Woodland Glade. A sightseeing bus called Kew Explorer 
makes a complete circuit of the gardens (with hop-on/hop-off service) and 
costs £4 ($6.60) adults, £1 ($1.65) children.
 
 Tired of the Tube? Why not take a boat to Kew Gardens? April to late 
September, vessels operated by the Westminster Passenger Service 
Association (% 020/7930-2062; www.wpsa.co.uk) leave from 
Westminster Pier daily at 10:30 a.m., 11 a.m., and 2 p.m. Round-trip fare for 
the 90-minute journey costs £17 ($28) adults, £11 ($18) seniors, £8.25 
($14) children, and £41 ($68) families (2 adults and 2 children). The last 
boat from Kew usually departs around 5:30 p.m. (depending on the tide).
Kew. % 020/8332-5622. www.rbgkew.org.uk. Tube: Kew Gardens (then a 
10-minute walk west on Broomfield Street to the Victoria Gate entrance on Kew 
Road). Admission: Gardens £13 ($21) adults, £11 ($18) seniors and students, free for

A quaint village just a Tube ride away
The London that you see today was once a series of separate villages. 
The nearby village of Hampstead, with its adjacent heath land, still 
retains its rural charm and makes for an excellent mini day trip.
Hampstead and Hampstead Heath
Although only 15 minutes by Tube from Central London, Hampstead main-
tains its old-world charm. It’s filled with Regency and Georgian houses 
(many set in lovely gardens) favored by artists and writers, from Keats to 
John le Carré. Flask Walk, the village’s pedestrian mall, provides an eclectic 
assemblage of historic pubs, shops, and chic boutiques. The village itself 
has a lot of old alleys, steps, courts, and groves just begging to be explored.
Adjacent Hampstead Heath is 324 hectares (800 acres) of high parkland, 
offering an opportunity for picnicking, swimming, and fishing. On a clear 
day, you can see St. Paul’s Cathedral and even the hills of Kent. An excur-
sion here takes up at least a half-day or more.
See map p. 229. Tube: Hampstead (the Tube stop is 1 minute from Flask Walk) or 
Hampstead Heath (Parliament Hill, right behind the Tube stop, leads up into the park 
itself).
Kenwood House
This lovely neoclassical villa sits on the shore of Kenwood Lake in the 
northern section of Hampstead Heath. The villa was remodeled in the 
1760s by Robert Adam. Inside, you find a small but impressive collection 
of paintings (with works by Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Reynolds, Turner, 
and Vermeer) and jewelry. You can get something to eat in the cafeteria 
in the former coach house. For an enjoyable summer outdoor concert 
experience, visit the Kenwood Lakeside concert (see Chapter 15). Give 
yourself about an hour to see everything. 
Hampstead Lane (Hampstead), NW3. % 020/8348-1286. Tube: Archway (then bus no. 
210 west along Highgate and Hampstead Lane). Admission: Free. Open: Apr–Oct 
daily 11 a.m.–6 p.m.; Nov–Mar daily 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
Royal castles and palaces
Everyone wants to see Buckingham Palace, the queen’s London resi-
dence. But another royal residence, accessible year-round, awaits in 
nearby Windsor. Just as memorable is Hampton Court, another great 
royal compound from the time of Henry VIII.
 
 Hampton Court Palace
In 1514, Cardinal Wolsey began building the splendid Tudor Hampton 
Court in East Moseley, Surrey, 13 miles west of London on the north side 

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 229
of the Thames. Henry VIII nabbed Hampton Court for himself and made it 
a royal residence, which it remained until 1760. The Anne Boleyn Gate, 
with its 16th-century astronomical clock, and the Great Hall, with its ham-
mer-beam ceiling, are remnants from Hampton Court’s Tudor days. Later, 
the palace was much altered by Sir Christopher Wren for William and 
Mary. Wren also designed the famous Maze, where visitors can wander in 
dizzy confusion. Inside the enormous palace are various state apartments 
and private rooms, including the King’s Dressing Room and Tudor kitch-
ens, which contain wooden carvings by Grinling Gibbons, Italian paint-
ings, and guides dressed in period costumes. The manicured Thames-side

 Windsor Castle
Windsor is one of the queen’s official residences. The castle, with its 
imposing skyline of towers and battlements rising from the center of the 
1,942-hectare (4,800-acre) Great Park, is located in Windsor, Berkshire, 20 
miles from the center of London. Royals have used the castle as a resi-
dence since its construction by William the Conqueror approximately 900 
years ago. The State Apartments that are open to visitors range from the 
intimate chambers of Charles II to the enormous Waterloo Chamber, built 
to commemorate the victory over Napoleon in 1815. All apartments are 
furnished with important works of art from the Royal Collection. Queen 
Mary’s Dollhouse, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens as a present for Queen 
Mary in 1921, is a marvelous palace in miniature. St. George’s Chapel, a 
Gothic masterpiece of the 14th century, is the burial place of ten mon-
archs and the home of the Order of the Garter.
April through June, the Changing of the Guard takes place Monday 
through Saturday at 11 a.m. (on alternate days the rest of the year). From 
the ramparts of Windsor, you can look down on the playing fields of Eton 
College, where aristocrats have been sending their boys for generations. 
All the royals attend the famous school in the charming town of Eton 
across the Thames Bridge. Give yourself a full day for this excursion.
Windsor. % 01753/831118. www.royalcollection.org.uk. Train: Trains 
leave every half-hour from Waterloo Station for the 50-minute trip (the stop is

staterooms may be closed for official functions, so check Web site for closings.
Ghost palace
So many people, from staff to visitors, have reported encounters with Catherine 
Howard’s ghost in the “haunted gallery” at Hampton Court that psychologists from the 
University of Hertfordshire conducted an investigation to see if they could find a scien-
tific explanation for the phenomenon. Not surprisingly, the results were inconclusive. 
Catherine, the fifth wife of King Henry VIII, was locked up in Hampton Court prior to her 
beheading for adultery in 1542. One day, she supposedly escaped and, in desperation, 
ran along the 40-foot gallery to pound on the king’s door and beg for mercy. Sightings 
in this gallery of a running, screaming apparition have been reported for centuries.

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 231
Greenwich: The center of time and space
Time is of the essence in Greenwich, a town and borough of Greater 
London, about 4 miles east of the City. The world’s clocks are set 
according to Greenwich Mean Time, and visitors from around the globe 
flock here to stand on the prime meridian, the line from which the 
world’s longitude is measured. The historic buildings in Greenwich are 
important enough that UNESCO has listed them as a World Heritage Site. 
Greenwich offers enough to keep you fully occupied for a full day, and it 
makes a great outing for kids.
The most interesting route to get to Greenwich is by Docklands Light 
Rail from Tower Hill Gateway, which takes you past Canary Wharf and 
all the new Docklands development. The one-way fare costs £4 ($6.60). 
Take the train to Island Gardens, the last stop, and then walk through 
the foot tunnel beneath the Thames to Greenwich. You come out next to 
the Cutty Sark. You can also take the Jubilee Underground line to 
Greenwich North and then bus no. 188 to the Cutty Sark. Thames River 
Services (% 020/7930-4097) runs a year-round fleet of boats from 
Westminster Pier to Greenwich Pier. A round-trip ticket costs £11 ($18) 
adults, £28 ($46) for families (2 adults and 2 children).
All the attractions in Greenwich are clearly signposted, and you can 
reach them on foot. The Greenwich Tourist Information Centre, Pepys 
House, Cutty Sark Gardens (% 0870/608-2000) is open daily 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. The center offers walking tours (at 12:15 p.m. and 2:15 p.m.), lasting 
90 minutes to two hours, of the town’s major sights for £4 ($6.60). 
Reservations aren’t necessary, but you may want to call first to make 
sure that the schedule hasn’t changed.
 Cutty Sark
The majestic Cutty Sark, berthed on the River Thames, is the last of the 
tea-clipper sailing ships. It was launched in 1869 and first used for the 
lucrative China Sea tea trade. Later, the ship carried wool from Australia, 
and after that (up until the end of World War II), it served as a training 
ship. The ship had been closed for restoration when a fire struck on May 
21, 2007, causing major damage. It was scheduled to reopen in late 2008, 
but soaring repair costs have delayed progress. Until the vessel reopens, 
you can visit an adjacent exhibition that details the history of the Cutty 
Sark and the work that’s being done to save it. You can see the exhibition 
in about 15 minutes.
Cutty Sark Visitor Centre, King William Walk. % 020/8858-3445. www.cuttysark.
org.uk. Admission: £2 ($3.30) per person. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Dec 
24–26.
National Maritime Museum
The paintings of ships are boring, but the National Maritime Museum also 
displays sailing crafts and models and an extensive exhibit on Lord 
Nelson, which includes hundreds of his personal artifacts (including the 

Part IV: Exploring London 
232
coat that he was wearing when he was shot at the Battle of Trafalgar). New 
galleries, with interactive technology, explore modern maritime issues. 
You can sail through in about a half-hour. There’s a nice cafe for lunch or 
a snack.
In Greenwich Park. % 020/8312-6608. www.nmm.ac.uk. Admission: Free. Open: 
Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. June–Sept).
Queen’s House
Adjacent to the National Maritime Museum, you can find the splendidly 
restored Queen’s House, designed by Inigo Jones in 1616 and later used 
as a model for the White House. The house, the first classical building in 
England, was commissioned by Anne of Denmark, the wife of James I, and 
completed in 1635 (with later modifications). You can visit the royal apart-
ments on a self-guided tour that takes about a half-hour. You may catch a 
special exhibit being held here.
In Greenwich Park. % 020/8312-6608. www.nmm.ac.uk. Admission: Free. Open: 
Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Royal Naval College
Near the Cutty Sark, the Royal Naval College occupies the site of Greenwich 
Palace, which stood here from 1422 to 1620 and was the birthplace of 
Henry VIII, Mary I, and Elizabeth I. Badly damaged by Cromwell’s troops 
during the English Civil War, the palace was later torn down, and, in 1696, 
a naval hospital for retired seamen was erected in its place. The Thames-
side buildings, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, became the Naval 
College in 1873 and are today a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site. 
The only rooms open to visitors are the chapel and the imposing Great 
Hall with its dazzling painted ceiling. The body of Lord Nelson lay in state 
here in 1805. You can see the building in just a few minutes.
King William Walk. % 020/8858-2154. www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org. 
Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
 
 Royal Observatory Greenwich
Huff your way up the hill from Queen’s House (see listing earlier in this 
section), in Greenwich Great Park, to explore the Royal Observatory, 
where you can straddle the prime meridian (longitude 0 degrees), the 
center of time and space. The Observatory reopened in 2007, after a spec-
tacular £15-million redevelopment. Interactive exhibits in the new Weller 
Astronomy Galleries explain how stars and planets are born and help 
unravel the mysteries of the universe. The Star Life planetarium show, in 
the new, state-of-the-art Peter Harrison Planetarium, explores the night 
sky and how stars are born, grow up, grow old, and die. Shows are hosted 
by real astronomers, who are available to answer questions after the main 
program (children must be 7 years or older). Also look for the collection 
of original 18th-century chronometers (marked H1, H2, H3, and H4), beautiful 

 Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 233

Seeing London by Guided Tour
When it comes to London sightseeing tours, you’re limited only by your 
imagination, stamina, and budget. You can tour London with an experi-
enced guide by bus, by boat, or on foot.
Bus tours
Original London Sightseeing Tours (% 020/8877-1722; www.the
originaltour.com) maintains a fleet of double-decker buses (many of 
them open on top), offers hop-on/hop-off service at more than 90 board-
ing points around the city, and includes a 50-minute river cruise. You 
can choose from three tour routes. The Original London Sightseeing 
Tour lasts 90 minutes and passes every major sight in Central London 
and the South Bank; the tour starts from Piccadilly Circus (Tube: Piccadilly 
Circus) on Coventry Street and departs every few minutes daily from 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 9 p.m. in summer). You don’t have to book any of the 
sightseeing tours in advance; you can pay on the bus. A ticket, good for 
24 hours on all routes, costs £24 ($40) for adults, £12 ($20) for children 
15 and under, and £84 ($139) for families (2 adults, 3 children). For more 
information or to book discounted tickets online, check out the Web site.
The Big Bus Company (% 020/7233-9533; www.bigbus.co.uk) leaves 
from Green Park, Victoria, and Marble Arch daily, from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
(4:30 p.m. in winter), on three different routes that take anywhere from 
90 minutes to two and a half hours. Tickets include a river cruise and 
walking tours, and cost £25 ($41) adults, £10 ($17) children ages 5 to 15, 
and £60 ($99) families (2 adults, 3 children). Valid for 24 hours, they let 
you hop on and off at 54 locations. Big Bus often has special offers, too, 
throwing in cheap theater tickets, fast-entry to popular attractions, and 
so on.
Another tour company with many guided excursions is Golden Tours, 
4 Fountain Square, 123–151 Buckingham Palace Rd. (% 800/456-6303 in 
the U.S., or 020/7233-7030; www.goldentours.co.uk). Its buses are 
comfy and have restrooms, and the certified guides have a certifiable 
sense of humor. The daily Historic & Modern London tour is a full-day 
outing that includes the West End, Westminster Abbey, the Changing of 
the Guard (at Buckingham Palace or Horse Guards Parade), the City of 
London, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Tower of London, and a cruise from the 
Tower down to Charing Cross Pier; the price includes a pub lunch and

all admissions. This tour costs £64 ($106) adults, £59 ($97) seniors and 
students, and £54 ($89) children 15 and under. Tours depart from the 
office at Buckingham Palace Road (Tube: Victoria) and other points in 
Central London. You can book your tickets directly or online, or you can 
ask your hotel concierge to do it two days in advance.
Boat tours
A cruise down the majestic Thames is a marvelous way to take in the 
city’s sights. Sightseeing boats regularly ply the river between 
Westminster and the Tower of London; some continue downstream to 
Greenwich (site of the prime meridian, Cutty Sark, and Old Royal 
Observatory) and upstream to Kew Gardens and Hampton Court. The 
main departure points along the Thames are at Westminster Pier (Tube: 
Westminster), Waterloo Pier (Tube: Waterloo), Embankment Pier 
(Tube: Embankment), Tower Pier (Tube: Tower Hill), and Greenwich 
Pier (Tube: Greenwich).
Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk) runs a 
fleet of commuter and sightseeing boats on the Thames from Westminster 
Pier to Greenwich. An all-day hop-on/hop-off DLR Rail & River Rover 
ticket costs £14 ($23) adults, £33 ($54) families (2 adults and 2 children). 
You can buy tickets at Westminster, Waterloo, Tower, or City piers.
Daily from March through November and on weekends the rest of the 
year, Bateaux London (% 020/7695-1800; www.bateauxlondon.com) 
offers a lunch cruise departing at 12:30 p.m. that costs from £26 ($43) 
adults, £17 ($28) children. A nightly dinner cruise leaves at 7:15 p.m. 
and returns at 9:45 p.m. The cruise, which includes a two- to four-course 
dinner, with live music and after-dinner dancing, costs from £64 to £113 
($106–$186) per person, depending on the various add-ons that you 
choose. A two-hour Sunday jazz lunch cruise departs at 12:30 p.m. and 
costs from £42 ($69) per person. Advance reservations are required for 
all tours, and a smart-casual dress code applies (no sweatpants or run-
ning shoes). All cruises depart from Embankment Pier.
An amphibious tour
 
 London Duck Tours (% 020/7928-3132; www.londonducktours.
co.uk) has adapted several World War II amphibious troop carriers, 
known as DUKWs, to civilian comfort levels and painted them bright 
yellow. It runs 80-minute road-and-river trips. Tours start behind County 
Hall (site of the London Eye giant observation wheel). It picks up passen-
gers on Chicheley Street (Tube: Westminster; then walk across 
Westminster Bridge), and then rumbles through Westminster and up to 
Piccadilly, gathering bemused stares as it passes many of London’s major 
tourist sites. Then the vehicle splashes into the Thames, at Vauxhall, for 
a 30-minute cruise as far as the Houses of Parliament. The tours start at 
£20 ($33) adults, £16 ($26) seniors, and £14 ($23) children.

Walking tours
A walking tour is an affordable way to see London from street level in 
the company of a knowledgeable guide. This type of tour is great for his-
tory, literature, and architecture buffs, and older kids generally have a 
good time as well. The weekly events listings in Time Out magazine, 
available at every news agent in London, include dozens of intriguing 
walks; a walk happens every day.
 
 The Original London Walks (% 020/7624-3978; www.walks.com), offers 
a terrific array of tours, including Jack the Ripper’s London, Christopher 
Wren’s London, Oscar Wilde’s London, and The Beatles’ Magical 
Mystery Tour. Guides lead different walks every day of the week, rain or 
shine; tours last about two hours and begin and end near Underground 
stations. You don’t need to make advance reservations. Call or check the 
Web site for schedules and departure points. A London Walk costs £7 
($12) adults, £5 ($8.25) seniors and students with ID; children 14 and 
under can tour for free, if accompanied by a parent.
If you want to follow detailed strolls, without the help of a guide, check 
out the tours offered in Frommer’s 24 Great Walks in London, by Richard 
Jones (Wiley).

Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter
▶ Getting your VAT refund
▶ Taking your purchases through Customs
▶ Visiting the big department stores
▶ Shopping Knightsbridge and the West End
L
ondon is one of the world’s great shopping meccas. If shopping is 
on your agenda, you can find any item that you’re looking for. A 
couple of years ago, I would have said you won’t find many bargains in 
London except during the department stores’ big sales in January and 
July. Now that the U.K. is in the midst of a recession, however, stores 
throughout the city are having sales. There’s no telling how long this will 
last, but for now, shoppers may be surprised at the bargains available in 
London stores.
Surveying the Shopping Scene
 
 You get the best values on goods that are manufactured in England. Items 
from the Body Shop, Filofax, or Dr. Martens cost less than they do abroad. 
Other potentially good values include woolens and cashmeres, English 
brands of bone china, English toiletries, antiques, used silver, old maps and 
engravings, and rare books. You can also do well with French products.
You may be surprised — and perhaps disappointed — at the number of 
big U.S. chains (called multiples in the U.K.) that have opened stores in 
London. But in addition to the familiar chains and mega-stores, London 
is still the home of hundreds of small, unique specialty shops and bou-
tiques that delight the eye and empty the wallet.
Normal shopping hours are Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5:30 
p.m., with a late closing (7 or 8 p.m.) on Wednesday or Thursday. The 
law allows stores to be open for six hours on Sunday, usually 11 a.m. to 
5 p.m. More and more of the larger department stores now stay open 
until 8 or 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday.

Getting the VAT back
You have to pay a 17.5 percent value-added tax (VAT) in London and 
throughout the United Kingdom on every retail item except books and 
children’s clothing. Anyone who isn’t a resident of the European Union 
can get a VAT refund, but every store requires a minimum purchase to 
qualify. The exact amount varies from store to store, but the minimum 
amount is never less than £50 ($83) and may be as high as £100 ($165) at 
a store like Harrods. But qualifying for a tax refund is far easier in Britain 
than in almost any other country in the European Union.

Part IV: Exploring London 
240
 
 VAT isn’t charged on goods shipped out of the country, no matter how 
much you spend, although books are exempt. You can avoid VAT and the 
hassle of lugging large packages back with you by having London stores 
ship your purchases for you; many are happy to do so. However, shipping 
charges can double the cost of your purchase, and you may also have to 
pay U.S. duties when the goods arrive. Instead of using this costly strat-
egy, consider paying for excess baggage (rates vary with the airlines) 
when you fly home.
 
 To get a VAT refund, you must get a VAT refund form from the retailer, 
and the retailer must complete the form at the time of purchase. Don’t 
leave the store without a completed refund form. Don’t let any merchant 
tell you that you can get refund forms at the airport.
You can get back about 15 percent of the 17.5 percent VAT that you pay 
on your purchases. (You can’t get back the entire amount.) To obtain 
your refund, follow these steps:
 
1. Ask the store whether it does VAT refunds and how much the 
minimum purchase is.
 
2. If you’ve spent the minimum amount, ask for the VAT refund 
paperwork.
 
 The retailer must fill out a portion.
 
3. Fill out your portion of the form (name and address).
 
4. Present the form — along with the goods — at the Cash VAT 
Refund counter at the airport.
 
 Your form will be stamped, after which you have two options for 
getting your money back:
 
 You can get your refund in British pounds right there at the 
Cash VAT Refund counter.
 
 You can mail in the papers and receive your refund in a 
British check (no!) or a credit card refund (yes!).
Saving on the London sales
Traditionally, London stores hold sales in January and July. In recent times, the July 
sales have begun in June or earlier. The January sale is the main event, and it generally 
starts after the first week (when round-trip airfares are low).
The January sale at Harrods is the most famous, but nearly every other store has a big 
sale at the same time. Discounts usually range from 25 percent to 50 percent at the 
major stores, such as Harrods and Selfridges. At Harrods, you can find the best buys on 
the store’s logo souvenirs, English china, and English designer brands, such as Jaeger.

 Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 241
 
 You may be required to show the goods at your time of departure, so 
don’t pack them in your checked luggage; put them in your carryon 
instead.
 
 If you’re traveling from London to other countries in the European Union, 
don’t apply for your VAT refund at the London airport. Apply for all your 
VAT refunds at one time at your final destination, prior to departure from 
the European Union.
Getting your goodies through Customs
The U.S. Customs authority doesn’t impose limits on how much loot U.S. 
citizens can bring home from a trip abroad, but it does put limits on how 
much they can bring back for free. You may bring home $800 worth of 
goods duty-free if you’ve been out of the country at least 48 hours and 
haven’t used the exemption in the past 30 days. Here’s some additional 
information about the limit and Customs law.
 
✓ You can bring back not more than 1 liter of an alcoholic beverage, 
although you must be 21 or over in order to carry any alcohol.
 
✓ You can carry up to 200 cigarettes and 100 cigars.
 
✓ Antiques more than 100 years old and works of art are exempt from 
the $800 limit, as is anything that you mail home from abroad.
 
✓ You may mail up to $200 of goods to yourself (marked “For 
Personal Use”) and up to $100 of goods to others (marked 
“Unsolicited Gift”) once each day, as long as the package doesn’t 
include alcohol or tobacco products.
 
✓ You have to pay an import duty on anything over these limits — a 
flat rate of 10 percent duty on the next $1,000 worth of purchases.
 
 Be sure to have your receipts with you. For more specific guidance, 
contact the U.S. Customs Service, P.O. Box 7407, Washington, DC 20044 
(% 202/927-6724; www.cbp.gov). The Web site allows you to view and 
download the pamphlet “Know Before You Go.”
Returning Canadian citizens are allowed a C$300 exemption and can 
bring back, free of duty, 200 cigarettes, 1kg (2.2 lbs.) of tobacco, 40 impe-
rial ounces (1.2 qrts.) of liquor, and 50 cigars. Declare all valuables that 
you’re taking with you to the United Kingdom, such as expensive cam-
eras, on the Y-38 Form before you leave Canada. For a clear summary 
of Canadian rules, write for the booklet “I Declare,” issued by Revenue 
Canada, 2265 St. Laurent Blvd., Ottawa K1G 4KE (% 800/461-9999 or 
613/993-0534; www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca).
Returning Australian citizens have a duty-free allowance of A$400 (A$200 
for children 17 and under). Citizens can bring home, free of duty, 250 
cigarettes or 250 grams of loose tobacco, and 1.125 liters of alcohol. 
Australian citizens who plan to return home with valuable goods that 
they already own (for example, foreign-made cameras) need to file Form 

Part IV: Exploring London 
242
B263 before leaving Australia. For more information, contact Australian 
Customs Services, GPO Box 8, Sydney NSW 2001 (% 1300/363-263; 
www.customs.gov.au).
The duty-free allowance for New Zealand citizens is NZ$700. Citizens 18 
and older can bring in up to 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 250 grams of 
tobacco, or a mix of all three if the combined weight doesn’t exceed 250 
grams; plus 4.5 liters of beer and wine, or 1.125 liters of liquor. To avoid 
paying duty on goods that you already own (cameras and the like), fill 
out a certificate of export before you leave New Zealand, listing the 
valuables that you’re taking out of the country. For more information, 
contact New Zealand Customs, The Customhouse, 17–21 Whitmore St.,

Checking Out the Big Names
London is full of department stores. Some, like world-famous Harrods, 
may be familiar to you. Others, like Harvey Nichols, may be pleasant sur-
prises. Each of these established department stores has its own style 
and personality. 
Fenwick of Bond Street
Mayfair
Fenwick of Bond Street is a high-style women’s fashion store. Fenwick 
(pronounced fen-ick) was founded in 1891 and offers an impressive collec-
tion of designer women’s wear, ranging from moderately priced ready-to-
wear items to more expensive designer fashions. Fenwick also sells an 
array of lingerie in all price ranges.
See map p. 250. 63 New Bond St., W1. % 020/7629-9161. www.fenwick.co.uk. 
Tube: Bond Street. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m. (until 8 p.m. Wed); Sun noon 
to 6 p.m.
 
 Fortnum & Mason
St. James’s
Fortnum & Mason holds two Royal Warrants (a form of official patronage 
that the store can use in its advertising) and serves as the queen’s London 
grocer. Amid a setting of deep-red carpets and crystal chandeliers, you 
can find everything from pâté de foie gras to Campbell’s soup. The gro-
cery department carries the finest foods from around the world, and on 
the other floors, you can find bone china, crystal, leather, antiques, and 
stationery departments. Dining choices include Patio, St. James’s, and 
The Fountain (see Chapter 10).

Harrods
Knightsbridge
Harrods may be the most famous department store in the world, but I’ve 
always found its merchandise to be pretty dull stuff. Carrying one of the 
coveted green plastic Harrods bags that you get with your purchase can 
provide you with a sense of accomplishment, though. The store’s 300 
departments offer an enormous range and variety of merchandise. Best of 
all are the Food Halls, stocked with a huge variety of foods and several 
cafes. Believe it or not, you may not be admitted if you’re wearing inap-
propriate clothing or your belly button is showing.
See map p. 248. 87–135 Brompton Rd., SW1. % 020/7730-1234. www.harrods.
com. Tube: Knightsbridge. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–8 p.m.; Sun 11:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
 
 Harvey Nichols
Knightsbridge
Harvey Nichols, the late Princess Diana’s favorite store, has its own gour-
met food hall and fancy restaurant, The Fifth Floor, and is crammed with 
designer home furnishings, gifts, and fashions. Women’s clothing is the 
largest segment of its business, a familiar fact to those fans of the 1990s 
British TV series Absolutely Fabulous. Harvey Nicks, as it’s called, doesn’t 
compete with Harrods because the former features a much more upmar-
ket, fashionable image.

Sun 11:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
 
 Liberty
Mayfair
Liberty provides six floors of fashion, china, home furnishings, upholstery 
fabrics, scarves, ties, luggage, and gifts. The store is best known for its 
Harrods loses Royal Warrants
The London gossip columns were ablaze early in 2000 when Prince Philip withdrew his 
Royal Warrant (a sign of official royal patronage) from Harrods, claiming that the royal 
household just didn’t use the store as much as it used to. Harrods just happens to be 
owned by Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi Al Fayed, who was killed with Princess 
Diana in that famous car crash. The elder Mr. Al Fayed, an Egyptian who’s been denied 
U.K. citizenship, has made some startling allegations against the House of Windsor, 
claiming that the deaths of Diana and his son were not accidental. Could that be the real 
reason that Harrods is now warrant-less?

Liberty Prints — fine-quality fabrics, typically in floral patterns. These 
distinctive fabrics are highly sought after by interior decorators because 
they add an unmistakable touch of England to any room décor. A Liberty 
tie makes a great gift for your guy back home.

10 a.m.–9 p.m.; Sun noon to 6 p.m.
Marks & Spencer
Mayfair
Marks & Spencer is a private-label department store that offers basics of 
all kinds. The merchandise at both locations is high quality and has, in 
recent years, moved way beyond the store’s trademark conservative 
image.
See map p. 250. 458 Oxford St., W1 (% 020/7935-7954; Tube: Marble Arch) and 173 
Oxford St., W1 (% 020/7437-7722; Tube: Oxford Circus). www.marksand

Selfridges
Mayfair
Selfridges is one of the largest department stores in Europe. The store has 
been redone to attract upscale customers, but its vast size provides room 
for less-expensive, mass-marketed lines as well. More than 500 divisions 
sell everything, from artificial flowers to groceries. The Miss Selfridge bou-
tique, on one side of the store near the cosmetics department, features 
teen fashions, hotshot clothes, accessories, makeup, and moderately 
priced, cutting-edge fashions. While on this side of the store, you can visit 
the cafe.

Tube: Bond Street or Marble Arch. Open: Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–9:30 p.m.; Sun noon 
to 6 p.m.
Finding a drugstore
The English refer to a drugstore as a chemist’s shop. All over London, you can find 
Boots the Chemist stores. In terms of size and convenience, the best one is just across 
from Harrods, at 72 Brompton Rd., SW3 (% 020/7589-6557; Tube: Knightsbridge). In 
addition to medicine, Boots sells film, pantyhose (called tights), sandwiches, and all of 
life’s little necessities. The store is open Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. and 
Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. One of the most centrally located chemists is Bliss the Chemist, 
5 Marble Arch, W1 (% 020/7723-6116; Tube: Marble Arch), open daily 9 a.m. to midnight. 
Zafash Pharmacy, 233–235 Old Brompton Rd., SW5 (% 020/7373-2798; Tube: Earl’s 
Court), is London’s only 24-hour pharmacy.

Shopping the Street Markets
Markets make for fun shopping because you never know what you may 
find. Adventurous shoppers who like to browse and dawdle can really 
enjoy themselves at the places listed in this section.
Brick Lane and Spitalfields Markets
On Sundays between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., Brick Lane Market, Cheshire 
Street and Sclater Street, E1 (% 020/7377-8963; Tube: Liverpool Street), 
is lined with hundreds of stalls, with clothing, fabrics, bric-a-brac, 
leather goods, antiques, and furniture all being traded. You may encoun-
ter some worthwhile bargains here, and you can check out the great 
Bangladeshi restaurants along the Lane.
Nearby Spitalfields Market, Commercial Street, E1 (no phone; www.
visitspitalfields.com; Tube: Liverpool Street), housed in a late 
19th-century market building, has undergone a complete transformation 
and is now a trendy new gathering spot where you’ll find great Italian 
and French breads, German cheesecakes and organic food, together 
with gifts, clothing, crafts, and knickknacks. The food court, where most 
world cuisines (including Chinese, West Indian, and Hungarian) are rep-
resented, is among the best of any London market. The market is open 
Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Camden Market
Vying with Portobello Road for the title of London’s most popular 
market, Camden actually boasts a number of distinct markets, which 
combine to give the visitor a great day out and bargains galore. Some 
areas are open Thursday through Saturday; others operate weekends 
only. The best of the many markets in Camden is the Stables Market (no 
phone; Tube: Camden Town), housed in a historic horse stable dating 
back to 1854 and offering an impressive array of fashion ranging from 
Goth, fetish, and cyberpunk to vintage, retro, and secondhand, plus 
stalls selling everything from secondhand records to leather goods, 
antiques, and other accessories. In addition to the markets, Camden 
High Street has some of the trendiest fashion boutiques in London.
Chelsea Antiques Market and Antiquarius
In a rambling old building, the Chelsea Antiques Market, 253 King’s Rd., 
SW3 (% 020/7352-5689; Tube: Sloane Square), offers endless bric-a-brac 
browsing possibilities. You can search out old or rare books at this 
market. You’ll probably run across Staffordshire dogs, shaving mugs, 
Edwardian buckles and clasps, ivory-handled razors, old velours, lace 
gowns, and wooden tea caddies — and that’s just the beginning. The 
market is closed on Sunday.
Another good market is Antiquarius, 131–141 King’s Rd., SW3 (% 020/
7351-5353; Tube: Sloane Square), where more than 120 dealers offer 

Part IV: Exploring London 
246
specialized merchandise — usually of the small, domestic variety, such 
as antique and period jewelry, porcelain, silver, first-edition books, 
boxes, clocks, prints, and paintings. The shops and booths are generally 
open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Covent Garden Market
The Covent Garden Market (% 020/7836-9136; www.coventgarden
market.co.uk; Tube: Covent Garden) includes retail stores and two 
different markets (the kind with open-air stalls), open daily 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m.
 
✓ Traders sell all kinds of goods at the busy Apple Market (no 
phone). Much of the merchandise is what the English call collectible 
nostalgia, which includes glassware and ceramics, leather goods, 
toys, clothes, hats, and jewelry. Antiques dealers predominate on 
Mondays.
 
✓ Jubilee Market (% 020/7836-2139), at the backside of Covent 
Garden, is a bit more downscale, where you can find cheap clothes 
and books. Some of London’s best shopping can be found at the 
restored hall on the Piazza and at specialty shops in the area.
Petticoat Lane market
Over 400 years old and still going strong, Petticoat Lane (% 020/7377-
8963; Tube: Liverpool Street) is one of the East End’s biggest and most 
famous markets, with over a thousand stalls. Taking up an area in and 
around Middlesex Street and Wentworth Street, E1, it’s open Monday 
through Friday 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and Sunday 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday is 
the best day for bargains on fashions, Asian fabrics, textiles, and jewelry. 
Haggling is a prerequisite.
Portobello Market
Kensington Church Street dead-ends at the Notting Hill Gate Tube sta-
tion, which is the jumping-off point for Portobello Market (no phone; 
www.portobelloroad.co.uk; Tube: Notting Hill Gate), the famous 
London street market along Portobello Road. Portobello (market and 
road) is a magnet for collectors of virtually anything from precious junk 
to precious antiques. The market is generally open Saturday 6 a.m. to 5 
p.m. You may find that perfect Regency commode that you’ve always 
wanted or a piece of Art Deco jewelry. But mixed in with the good stuff is 
an abundance of overpriced junk. Now that everything’s been discov-
ered and designated “collectible,” the prices are often too high.
 
 The Portobello Market on a busy Saturday is prime pickpocketing terri-
tory. Keep an eye or a hand on your wallet or purse.
 
 If you want to check out the shops along Portobello Road, you may want 
to visit during the week, when approximately 90 antiques and art shops 

 Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 247
are open and the street market is closed. Weekdays are a better time for 
serious collectors to shop, because they get more attention from dealers 
who aren’t distracted by the throngs of shoppers.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
London’s two major shopping areas are Knightsbridge and the West 
End. You can find some of London’s most famous and most impressive 
stores along several key streets in these two areas. You also can find all 
the department stores listed in the “Checking Out the Big Names” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter.
Knightsbridge: Home of Harrods
The home of department stores Harrods and Harvey Nichols, 
Knightsbridge is the second most famous of London’s retail districts. 
(See the “Shopping in Knightsbridge and Chelsea” map on p. 248.)
Brompton Road (home to Harrods) runs southwest from the 
Knightsbridge Tube stop. Beauchamp Place (pronounced beech-um), 
one of the streets running south from Brompton Road, is only 1 block 
long, but it’s full of the kinds of trendy, upscale shops where young 
British aristocrats buy their clothing for “the season.” In the 1980s, the 
future Princess Diana and other young bluebloods and yuppies were 
dubbed “the Sloane Rangers” because this area near Sloane Square was 
their favorite shopping grounds (and Range Rovers were their favorite 
cars). Cheval Place, running parallel to Brompton Road to the north, is 
lined with designer resale shops. Sloane Street, where you can find 
plenty of fashion boutiques, runs south from the Knightsbridge Tube 
stop to Sloane Square and the beginning of Chelsea.
The Map House of London, 54 Beauchamp Place, SW3 (% 020/7589-
4325; www.themaphouse.com; Tube: Knightsbridge), is an ideal place 
to find a sophisticated souvenir, maybe an antique map, an engraving, or 
an old print of London; a century-old original engraving can cost as little 
as £15 ($25).
Chelsea: The young and the antique
Chelsea is famous for King’s Road (Tube: Sloane Square). This is the 
area’s main street and, along with Carnaby Street, is branded in 
Londoner’s minds (those older than 50, that is) as the street of the 
Swinging Sixties. It’s still swinging today, especially on a Saturday, when 
you can hardly find room to walk. About one-third of King’s Road is 
devoted to antiques markets and multi-stores (large or small groups of 
indoor stands, stalls, and booths within one enclosure); another third 
houses design-trade showrooms and stores of household wares; and the 
remaining third stays faithful to the area’s teenybopper roots. King’s 
Road begins on the west side of the Sloane Square Tube stop.

 Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 249
A Chelsea emporium founded in 1877, Peter Jones, Sloane Square, SW1 
(% 020/7730-3434; www.peterjones.co.uk; Tube: Sloane Square), is 
known for household goods, household fabrics and trims, china, glass, 
soft furnishings, and linens. The linen department is one of the best in 
London. Lush, 123 King’s Rd., SW3 (% 020/7376-8348; www.lush.com; 
Tube: Sloane Square) is an aromatherapy bath and body shop where 
handmade soaps are cut from blocks, like cheese, and potential gifts 
include fizzing bath bombs. The other branches are in Covent Garden, 
Oxford Street, Kensington High Street, and Carnaby Street. You may also 
want to check out the Chelsea Antiques Market and Antiquarius. (See 
the “Shopping the Street Markets” section, earlier in this chapter.)
Kensington: Street chic
You can reach Kensington, west of Knightsbridge, by taking the Tube to 
High Street Kensington, the area’s preeminent shopping street. Many of 
this neighborhood’s retail shops cater to street-chic teens. Several chain 
stores are here as well.
Kensington Church Street, running north to Notting Hill, is one of the 
city’s main shopping avenues for antiques, selling everything from 
antique furniture to Impressionist paintings.
 The Children’s Book Centre, 237 Kensington High St., W8 (% 020/7937-
7497; Tube: High Street Kensington), is the best place in London to go for 
children’s books. Fiction is arranged according to age, up to 16. The center 
also sells videos and toys for kids.
Holborn: Heigh-ho, Silver!
Don’t let the slightly out-of-the-way Holborn location, or the facade’s lack 
of charm, put you off visiting the London Silver Vaults, Chancery House, 
53–63 Chancery Lane, WC2 (% 020/7242-3844; www.thesilvervaults.
com; Tube: Chancery Lane). Downstairs are the real vaults — 40 in all — 
filled with a staggering collection of old and new silver and silver plate, 
plus a collection of jewelry.
The West End: More famous shopping 
streets and stores
See the “Shopping in the West End” map on p. 250 for locations of the 
West End stores that I describe in the following sections. The key shop-
ping areas in the West End are:
 
✓ Oxford Street for affordable shopping
 
✓ Regent Street for fancier shops and more upscale department 
stores and specialty dealers
 
✓ Piccadilly for older, established department stores
 
✓ Jermyn Street for traditional English luxury goods

Part IV: Exploring London 
252
 
✓ Bond Street for chic, upscale fashion boutiques
 
✓ Covent Garden for all-purpose shopping, often with a hipper edge
 
✓ St. Martin’s Court (between Charing Cross Road and St. Martin’s 
Lane) for prints, posters, and books
Around Piccadilly Circus: A bit of everything
Many consider Piccadilly Circus the center of London. For the best 
shopping in this area, head south from the Piccadilly Tube stop along 
Piccadilly (the street) or northwest along Regent Street. The following 
list gives you some of the most renowned stores around Piccadilly 
Circus:
 
✓ Burberry, 18–22 Haymarket, SW1 (% 020/7930-3343; www.
burberry.com; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), sells those famous rain-
coats, plus top-quality men’s shirts, sportswear, knitwear, and 
accessories.
 
 
✓ Hatchards, 187 Piccadilly, W1 (% 020/7439-9921; www.hatchards.
co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), was established in 1797 and is 
London’s most historic and atmospheric bookstore.
Jermyn Street: Traditional luxury
Two-block-long Jermyn Street lies a block south of Piccadilly between 
St. James’s Street and Duke Street. Many of the posh men’s haberdasher-
ies and toiletry shops along this street have been doing business for 
centuries and cater to the royals. They include the following shops:
 
✓ Farlows, 9 Pall Mall, SW1 (% 020/7839-2423; www.farlows.
co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), is famous for fishing and shooting 
equipment and classic country clothing.
 
 
✓ Floris, 89 Jermyn St., SW1 (% 020/7930-2885; www.florislondon.
com; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), is a small, mahogany-clad store that’s 
been selling its own line of soaps and perfumes since 1851.
 
 
✓ Hilditch & Key, 73 Jermyn St., SW1 (% 020/7930-5336; www.
hilditchandkey.co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), has been sell-
ing perhaps the finest men’s shirts in the world for more than a 
century. These quality goods are 100 percent cotton, cut by hand, 
and sport buttons fashioned from real shell.
 
 
✓ Taylor of Old Bond Street, 74 Jermyn St., SW1 (% 020/7930-5544; 
www.tayloroldbondst.co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), was 
established in 1954 and is devoted to the shaving and personal 
hygiene needs of men. The store offers the world’s finest collection 
of shaving brushes, razors, and combs, plus soaps and hair lotions.
Regent Street: Upscale specialties
Regent Street begins in a grand, sweeping curve on the west side of 
Piccadilly Circus and heads north to intersect with Oxford Street. This 

 Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 253
majestic thoroughfare is lined with upscale department stores and spe-
cialty boutiques. The Burlington Arcade is a must-see if you’re in this 
area. This famous glass-roofed Regency passage, running from Piccadilly 
to Burlington Gardens, is lit by wrought-iron lamps and decorated with 
clusters of ferns and flowers. The arcade is lined with intriguing shops 
and boutiques. (See the “Shopping in the West End” map on p. 250 for 
locations of all the stores that I describe in this section.)
Savile Row, synonymous with hand-tailored men’s suits, lies a block 
west of Regent Street. Its once-countercultural counterpart — in the 
early Beatles years — is Carnaby Street, now making a big retail come-
back after years as a depressing street of souvenir shops; Carnaby Street 
is a block east of Regent Street. Royal Doulton Regent Street, 154 
Regent St., W1 (% 020/7734-3184; Tube: Piccadilly Circus or Oxford 
Circus), carries English bone china, including Minton, Royal Crown 
Derby, and Royal Doulton. (The Jan and July sales are excellent.) Scotch 
House, 84–86 Regent St., W1 (% 020/7734-0203; Tube: Piccadilly 
Circus), is known globally for its selection of cashmere and wool knit-
wear for men, women, and children; the store also sells tartan garments 
and accessories, as well as Scottish tweed classics.
If you’re left-handed, you’re in luck at Anything Left-Handed, 57 Brewer 
St. (off Regent Street), W1 (% 020/7437-3910; www.anythingleft-
handed.co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus). This unique store sells practi-
cal items — everything from scissors to corkscrews — for the 
southpaws in the world.
 Hamleys, 188–196 Regent St., W1 (% 020/7494-2000; www.hamleys.com; 
Tube: Piccadilly Circus), the finest toy shop in the world, stocks more 
than 35,000 toys and games on seven floors of fun and magic. You can get 
everything, from cuddly stuffed animals and dolls to radio-controlled cars, 
train sets, model kits, board games, outdoor toys, and computer games.
National Geographic Retail Store, 83–97 Regent St., W1 (% 020/7025-
6960; www.nglondonstore.co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), one of 
the most intriguing and eco-friendly new stores in London, opened in 
November 2008. Here you’ll find all manner of products relating to travel 
(both active and armchair) and scientific research, including luggage, 
books, globes, clothing, and much more. There’s an on-site gallery and a 
great cafe, too.
Oxford Street: Affordable big names
You may want to begin your shopping adventure on Oxford Street, get-
ting out at the Oxford Circus, Bond Street, or Tottenham Court Road 
Tube stop. Oxford Street is more affordable than Regent Street (which 
you can read about in the preceding section) — not as grand, but offer-
ing a good variety and quantity of stylish merchandise. (See the 
“Shopping in the West End” map on p. 250 for the locations of all the 
stores that I describe in this section.)

Part IV: Exploring London 
254
If you’re a chronic organizer who can’t live without your Filofax, head 
immediately for The Filofax Centre, 21 Conduit St., W1 (% 020/7499-
0457; www.filofax.com; Tube: Oxford Circus). At this store on 
Conduit Street, which leads west from Regency Street, you can find the 
entire range of inserts and books at prices that are lower than they are 
outside of the United Kingdom.
The Body Shop stores are based in the United Kingdom but are now 
all over the world; however, prices at the London branches are much 
lower. You can stock up on their politically and environmentally 
correct beauty, bath, and aromatherapy products at 375 Oxford St., W1 
(% 020/7409-7868; www.thebodyshop.com; Tube: Bond Street); other 
branches are located in every shopping zone in London.
Bond Street: Designer chic
Bond Street, running parallel to Regent Street on the west and connect-
ing Piccadilly with Oxford Street, is home to all the hot international 
designers and is London’s answer to New York’s Fifth Avenue. Bond 
Street is divided into New (the northern section) and Old (the southern 
section). Very expensive fashion boutiques line Bond Street and the 
adjacent streets. Davies Street, running south from outside the Bond 
Street Tube station, is just one of the area’s choicer streets; Davies 
Mews is an upscale shopping zone noted for its antiques dealers. You 
can access the area from the north by the Bond Street Tube stop and 
from the south by Green Park. (See the “Shopping in the West End” map 
on p. 250 for the locations of the stores that I describe in this section.)
Vivienne Westwood, 6 Davies St., W1 (% 020/7629-3757; www.
viviennewestwood.co.uk; Tube: Bond Street), is one of the hottest 
British designers for women. This flagship store carries a full range of 
jackets, skirts, trousers, blouses, dresses, and evening dresses. 
Church’s, 133 New Bond St., W1 (% 020/7493-1474; Tube: Bond Street), 
sells classy shoes easily recognized by the fashion elite. Chocolate 
connoisseurs should visit Charbonnel et Walker, 1 The Royal Arcade, 
28 Old Bond St., W1 (% 020/7491-0939; www.charbonnel.co.uk; 
Tube: Green Park), famous for its hot chocolate (buy it by the tin) and 
strawberries-and-cream chocolates.
Around Leicester Square: Music and memorabilia
Leicester Square itself boasts only giant movie palaces and touristy res-
taurants (and a reduced-price ticket booth). But the streets around 
Leicester Square are filled with shops selling rare books, prints, and 
posters, some relating to the performing arts. (See the “Shopping in the 
West End” map on p. 250 for the locations of the stores that I describe in 
this section.)

 Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 255
The Leicester Square shops include the following:
 
✓ Dress Circle, 57–59 Monmouth St., WC2 (% 020/7240-2227; www.
dresscircle.co.uk; Tube: Leicester Square), specializes in 
show-business memorabilia for all West End and Broadway shows.
 
✓ MDC Classic Music, 31–32 St. Martin’s Lane, WC2 (% 020/7240-
0270; www.mdcmusic.co.uk; Tube: Leicester Square), sitting 
right next to the English National Opera, specializes in opera 
recordings; you receive expert knowledge and personal service 
from the staff.
 
 
✓ Stanfords, 12–14 Long Acre, WC2 (% 020/7836-1321; www.
stanfords.co.uk; Tube: Leicester Square), was established 
in 1852, and is the world’s largest map shop (many of its maps, 
which include worldwide touring and survey maps, are unavailable 
elsewhere). Stanfords is also London’s best travel bookstore.
Charing Cross Road: A book lover’s delight
Though it’s changing with the times, like everything else in London, 
and is a ghost of its former bookish self, Charing Cross Road remains a 
street for browsing book lovers, with stores selling both new and old 
volumes. Many of these places sell maps and guides, too, including the 
tourist’s necessity, London A–Z. Remember: There is no added 17.5 per-
cent VAT charge on books. Some of the most fascinating bookstores 
include the following (for locations, see the “Shopping in the West End” 
map on p. 250):
 
✓ W & G Foyle, Ltd., 113–119 Charing Cross Rd., WC2 (% 020/
7440-3225; www.foyles.co.uk; Tube: Tottenham Court Road), 
claims to be the world’s largest bookstore, with an impressive 
array of hardcovers and paperbacks, as well as travel maps, 
records, videotapes, and sheet music.
 
✓ Silver Moon (% 020/7440-1562), London’s preeminent women’s 
book dealer, operates a boutique in Foyles.
Covent Garden: Something for everyone
Try to save some of your shopping energy for Covent Garden, home of 
what may be the most famous “market” in all of England: the Covent 
Garden Market (see the “Shopping the Street Markets” section, earlier 
in this chapter).
Excellent English soaps, toiletries, and aromatherapy goods, as well 
as herbal goods, are available throughout the market and surrounding 

Part IV: Exploring London 
256
streets, including at the following shops (for locations, see the “Shopping 
in the West End” map on p. 250):
 
✓ Culpeper the Herbalist, 8 The Market, Covent Garden, WC2 
(% 020/7379-6698; www.culpeper.co.uk; Tube: Covent Garden), 
sells food, bath, and aromatherapy products, as well as dream 
pillows, candles, sachets, and that popular favorite: the battery-
operated aromatherapy fan.
 
✓ Neal’s Yard Remedies, 15 Neal’s Yard (off Shorts Garden), WC2 
(% 020/7379-7222; http://remedies.nealsyardremedies.
com; Tube: Covent Garden), is noted the world over for its all-
natural, herbal-based bath, beauty, and aromatherapy products in 
cobalt-blue bottles.
 
 
✓ Penhaligon’s, 41 Wellington St., WC2 (% 020/7836-2150; www.
penhaligons.co.uk; Tube: Covent Garden), is an exclusive-line 
of Victorian perfumery dedicated to good grooming. Choose from a 
large selection of perfumes, after-shaves, soaps, candles, and bath 
oils for women and men.
Also in Covent Garden, you can find Dr. Martens Department Store, 1–4 
King St., WC2 (% 020/7497-1460; www.drmartens.com; Tube: Covent 
Garden), the flagship for internationally famous “Doc Marts” shoes. 
Prices are better here than they are in the States.
Farther along, at 14 King St., WC2, is The Irish Shop (% 020/7379-3625; 
Tube: Covent Garden), which sells a wide variety of articles shipped 
directly from Ireland, including colorful knitwear, traditional Irish linens, 
hand-knitted Aran fisherman’s sweaters, and Celtic jewelry.
And you can finish off at The Tea House, 15A Neal St., WC2 (% 020/
7240-7539; Tube: Covent Garden), which sells everything associated 
with tea, tea drinking, and teatime.

Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Options
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing London on a reasonable schedule
▶ Planning fun itineraries for trips lasting three to seven days
▶ Visiting London with kids
E
very London visitor has to face one problem: how to see as much as 
possible in a limited amount of time. You’re lucky if you have an 
entire week or more. But what if you have only three or five days at your 
disposal? What if you’re bringing the family along? These questions are 
what this chapter is all about. If you budget your time wisely and choose 
your sights carefully, you can make the most of a limited schedule or a 
trip with the kids.
This chapter offers four easy-to-do suggested daily itineraries. The first 
itinerary covers the big sights. The next two are a little more adventurous. 
The itinerary for families first addresses the top spots and then heads to 
family-friendly destinations just outside the city.
For complete descriptions of the sights, plus exact street addresses, 
open hours, and admission prices, see Chapter 11, unless I give you a 
different chapter to check out.
London in Three Days
Three days doesn’t seem like a very long time. But in that short period, 
you can hit most of the key sights in London for a memorable trip.
Start Day 1 with a visit to majestic Westminster Abbey, visiting the 
Royal Tombs and Poets’ Corner. Afterward, because they’re right next 
door, stroll around the Houses of Parliament. Unless you queue up to 
hear a debate or take one of the guided tours, available from August 
through September, you won’t be able to get inside, but you can enjoy a 

 Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 259
great riverside view from Westminster Bridge. On the opposite side of 
the Thames is the London Eye, a 450-foot-high observation wheel. 
Reserve in advance for the trip up and over London; otherwise, you may 
spend at least a half-hour in line for a ticket and another hour before 
your scheduled “flight.” You’re not far from Tate Britain, so if you’re in 
the mood to look at great English art, head over to Pimlico. Renting a 
self-guided audio tour is a great way to enhance your appreciation of the 
museum. Later in the afternoon, explore Piccadilly Circus, the teeming 
epicenter of London’s West End. You find great shopping on Regent 
Street, Piccadilly, and Jermyn Street (see Chapter 12 for shopping). If 
you haven’t already reserved a seat for a West End show, you may want 
to stop by the half-price ticket booth in Leicester Square to see what’s 
available (see Chapter 15 for info on theaters). Have dinner in Soho 
before the show (see Chapter 10 for restaurants).
Greet Day 2 with a walk through Green Park. You’re on your way to 
Buckingham Palace to witness the pageantry of the Changing of the 
Guard (check beforehand to make sure that it’s taking place that day).
If you’re visiting during August or September, you can tour the State 
Rooms of Buckingham Palace. Reserve tickets in advance, so you know 
your specific entry time; otherwise, you may have to wait in line for an 
hour or more to get in. If you’re not touring the palace itself, visit the 
Royal Mews. From Buckingham Palace, you can stroll down the Mall, 
through St. James’s Park, passing Clarence House, where the Queen 
Mother lived until her death in 2002 and which now serves as the London 
residence of Prince Charles and his two sons, William and Harry, and St. 
James’s Palace, where they lived before moving to Clarence House.
Trafalgar Square, London’s grandest and certainly most famous plaza, 
is your next stop. You can have lunch or tea at the National Gallery’s 
restaurant or at Café in the Crypt in St. Martin-in-the-Fields church, on 
the east side of the square (see Chapter 10 for more on these restaurants). 
Spend your afternoon viewing the treasures of the National Gallery. 
Renting one of the self-guided audio tours will help you to home in on 
the most important paintings in the collection. After dinner in the 
Covent Garden area or on a Thames River cruise, head to one of the 
bars, pubs, or clubs that I describe in Chapter 16.
On Day 3, arrive as early as you can at the Tower of London and imme-
diately join one of the one-hour guided tours led by the Beefeaters. 
Later, you can explore the precincts on your own, making certain you 
allot enough time to see the Crown Jewels. From the Tower, head over 
to nearby St. Paul’s Cathedral, which you can see in about a half-hour.
The British Museum, your next stop, has enough to keep you occupied 
for several days; if you want to see only the highlights, allow yourself a 
minimum of two hours. Finish off your afternoon in Knightsbridge at 
Harrods (see Chapter 12), the most famous department store in London 
and, perhaps, the world. Knightsbridge and adjacent South Kensington 
offer innumerable dining options (see Chapter 10).

Part IV: Exploring London 
260
London in Five Days
This section assumes that you’ve already followed the suggested itiner-
aries for your first three days (see the preceding section).
Day 4 begins at the National Portrait Gallery, where you can find the 
likeness of just about every famous British person you’ve ever heard of. 
Renting one of the self-guided audio tours is a good idea. From the 
National Portrait Gallery, you can easily walk to Covent Garden Market 
(see Chapter 12). Scores of interesting shops are in and around the market, 
and Covent Garden Piazza, a lively hub filled with restaurants, makes a 
perfect spot for lunch. Spend your afternoon strolling in Kensington 
Gardens and visiting Kensington Palace, once the London home of 
Princess Diana. Then go for a traditional English dinner at Rules, London’s
oldest restaurant, or Simpson’s-in-the-Strand (see Chapter 10). Are you 
up for a play or a concert tonight? If so, check your theater options in 
Chapter 15.
Day 5 begins with a morning at the museum of your choice. Choosing 
among the three major South Kensington museums — the Natural 
History Museum, the Science Museum, and the Victoria and Albert 
Museum — is entirely a matter of taste. If you like modern art, the new 
Tate Modern on the South Bank is the place to spend your morning. In 
the afternoon, expand your horizon with a short trip outside the city. 
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, Hampton Court, Windsor Palace, 
Hampstead Heath, and Greenwich aren’t terribly far away; the trips to 
reach them take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. You can be back 
in London in time for dinner.
London in Seven Days
How time flies! By now, if you follow the suggested itineraries for the last 
five days (see the preceding two sections), you’ve seen most of the 
major sights in London.
On Day 6, you’re ready for a day trip. Riding in one of Britain’s sleek new 
trains is terrific fun. The only problem is that you have to decide where 
you want to go. In Chapter 14, I give you the lowdown on six places, each 
remarkable in its own way. Do you want to see Shakespeare’s birthplace 
in Stratford-upon-Avon or the famous prehistoric stone circle called 
Stonehenge? Do you want to spend a day by the seaside in Brighton or 
strolling around ancient Canterbury with its mighty cathedral? Perhaps 
you want to head to Bath to discover its splendid Georgian crescents, or 
York to explore the venerable York Minster. You can reach most of 
these places in 90 minutes or less.

 Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 261
Day 7 is your last day in London, and you’ll want it to be special. In the 
morning, visit Madame Tussauds wax museum or one of the museums 
that you haven’t yet seen. Afterward, stroll through Hyde Park and stop 
at Apsley House, the London home of the first duke of Wellington. This 
house gives you a glimpse of what life was like inside one of London’s 
great private palaces. If it’s Sunday, you may instead want to visit 
Spencer House, the family home of the late Princess Diana. You can also 
do some last-minute shopping, if you prefer. Check out London’s various 
shopping neighborhoods in Chapter 12, and then make your way to the 
major shopping arteries: Knightsbridge, Oxford Street, Bond Street, 
King’s Road in Chelsea, or Regent Street. A traditional afternoon tea at 
one of London’s great hotels (see Chapter 10) makes a delightful end to 
the afternoon. After that? You’ve booked theater tickets, haven’t you?
London with Kids
So you want to spend five days in London and bring along your kids? No 
problem. I have a few suggestions to keep you and your kids excited and 
entertained. (For tips on traveling with kids, see Chapter 6.)
Don’t schedule too much on Day 1. Exercise helps ward off jet lag. After 
sitting in a plane for several hours, the best option may be to take 
smaller children to one of London’s great parks, so they can run and let 
off steam. Depending on where your hotel is located, your destination 
may be Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, Green Park, St. James’s Park, 
or Regent’s Park. If you’re traveling with teens, you may want to intro-
duce them to the city by taking a stroll through London’s four royal 
parks, following the Princess Diana Commemorative Walk.
You can begin more focused sightseeing on Day 2. Consider a guided 
bus tour that helps orient everyone and gives you at least a glimpse of 
all the major sights. Several outfits provide tours on double-decker 
buses — always a treat for kids — and one company offers a wonderful 
road and river trip on amphibious vehicles. After the tour, make the 
London Eye your first stop. Reserve your ticket beforehand to avoid 
waiting in a long line. Afterward, cross Westminster Bridge and stroll 
over to view the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. (If you’re lucky, the 
clock will strike the hour while you’re in the vicinity.) And because it’s 
close at hand, use this opportunity to visit Westminster Abbey. Younger 
children may not get much out of the place, but you will. Later in the 
afternoon, take a boat ride down the Thames to the Tower of London; 
you can board the boat at Westminster Pier near the Houses of 
Parliament. When you’re inside the Tower, hook up with one of the 
Beefeater tours. If you’re with a kid ages 10 to 17 or so, you may want to 
have dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe in Mayfair (see Chapter 10).

Part IV: Exploring London 
262
Begin Day 3 at the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, where 
the dinosaur exhibit with a ferocious animatronic T. rex captures the 
imaginations of both young and old(er). If your child’s a budding 
Einstein, the Science Museum, with its many hands-on, interactive 
exhibits, may be a better choice. Afterward, if you have small children in 
tow, stroll over to Kensington Gardens for a look at the famous statue of 
Peter Pan. The new Princess Diana Memorial Playground in the north-
west corner of Kensington Gardens enchants little ones. You can have 
lunch in The Orangery of adjacent Kensington Palace or make your way 
to Café in the Crypt (see Chapter 10) in St. Martin-in-the-Fields church 
Organizing your time
You can make the most of your visit to London if you organize your days efficiently and 
with common sense. Disorganized travelers waste a lot of time, show up at the museum 
on the day it’s closed, and end up in the nether regions of Tooting Bec because they 
hopped on the wrong Underground line. Don’t assume that every museum or site is open 
every day, all day. Take a moment to look at the details that I provide for each attraction 
in Chapter 11. And carry a copy of London A–Z.
An average top sight takes about two hours to visit, after you’re actually inside. Some 
(Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews) take more; others (Westminster Abbey and 
St. Paul’s) take less. But other variables enter in: whether you’re taking a guided tour 
(usually about an hour to an hour and a half, no matter where), whether you have kids 
in tow, or whether lines move slowly due to the crowds of visitors. Predicting how much 
time you’ll spend at a major attraction, such as the British Museum and the National 
Gallery, is difficult. But as a general rule, you can do about three or four sights in a day 
if you’re pushing yourself, fewer if you’re not.
Many of London’s major sights are concentrated in specific areas, so walking is the 
best way to see several sights in a short period of time. To cover larger areas, I recom-
mend that you take the fast and convenient Underground.
Try to hit the very top sights on your list early in the day, preferably when they open, or 
late in the afternoon. Visit the places that are really important to you when you’re feeling 
fresh and when they’re less crowded. I mean, in particular, Buckingham Palace (when 
it’s open to the public during Aug and Sept), the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, 
and Madame Tussauds. Westminster Abbey, to cite just one example, can receive 
upwards of 15,000 visitors per day!
Unless you have adrenaline to spare, try to unwind a little before you begin your round 
of after-dark diversions. You may need some downtime between the end of your sight-
seeing day and the beginning of your evening activities. I suggest that you head back 
to your hotel for an hour or so, to take a shower or bath, to curl up with a novel or the 
evening paper, or maybe to catch a quick snooze to recharge your batteries. Then it’s 
back to those perennially fascinating London streets.

 Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 263
in Trafalgar Square; you find a brass-rubbing center in the church, too. If 
you’re with a teen, you may want to spend the morning or afternoon in 
Madame Tussauds wax museum or the London Dungeon; just keep in 
mind that young children may find some of the gorier exhibits frighten-
ing. In the evening, older kids and teens may also enjoy one of the West 
End’s razzmatazz musicals. If dinner and a play for just the grown-ups 
sounds good, you can get a baby sitter for the little ones (see the Quick 
Concierge, at the end of this book, for a reputable service).
Make Day 4 a day trip to Brighton, on the Sussex coast (see Chapter 14). 
The quick trip takes less than an hour. After you arrive, you can visit the 
Royal Pavilion and take the kids over to Palace Pier, a spot filled with 
games and souvenir stands. If the weather’s warm, you can rent a deck 
chair and sit on the beach. Brighton is a fun place just to stroll around, 
with plenty to keep you and the family entertained.
On Day 5, head out to Hampton Court Palace, another quick train ride of 
less than an hour. Hampton Court offers much to explore, so give yourself 
at least four hours. Small children may not get much out of the visit, but 
they’ll probably be intrigued by the staff wearing period costumes. You 
can eat on the premises. Save the best part for last: The famous maze in 
the gardens brings out the kid in everyone. Finally, return to London for a 
good night’s rest before flying out the next morning.

Going beyond London: 
Six Great Day Trips
In This Chapter
▶ Taking the best day trips from London
▶ Getting there and back
▶ Deciding what to see and do after you arrive
▶ Choosing where to eat and where to stay
E
ngland is a relatively small country. You can visit countless places 
on one-day side trips from London.
In Chapter 11, I describe the easiest side trips from London: Kew 
Gardens, Hampton Court Palace, Windsor Palace, and Greenwich. In 
this chapter, I venture out to some of England’s most popular, impressive, 
and famous places: Bath, Brighton, Canterbury, Stratford-upon-Avon, 
Stonehenge, and York. By train, you can get to all these sites in two hours 
or less from London (see the “Day Trips from London” map on p. 265).
By Train or by Car: Weighing the Options
Because of England’s small size and easy-access train and road net-
works, this country is a joy to explore.
For all the trips in this chapter, I recommend that you take the train 
instead of renting and driving a car. From London, you can reach Bath, 
Brighton, and Canterbury in 90 minutes or less by train. The train trips 
to Stratford-upon-Avon, Salisbury (the closest large town to Stonehenge), 
and York take about two hours. At each of these places, the attractions 
are within walking distance of the train station. The one exception is 
Stonehenge, which you can reach by public bus from Salisbury. If you 
get an early start, you can explore any one of these places, have lunch, 
and still get back to London in time for dinner.
The following sections help you decide whether train travel or 
auto-motion is for you.

Day Trips from London

Part IV: Exploring London 
266
Taking the train
 
 If you plan to travel around England by train, get a BritRail pass before you 
arrive (they’re not available in the U.K.) from BritRail (% 866-274-8724; 
www.britrail.com). A BritRail pass is the most convenient and eco-
nomical way to explore England. The London Plus Pass gets you to five 
of the towns in this chapter — Brighton, Canterbury, Salisbury, Bath, 
and Stratford-upon-Avon (plus Windsor, which you can read about in 
Chapter 11) — but not to York. Trains offer first-class and standard-class 
seating — first-class cars are less crowded, and the seats are roomier and 
comfier. Because the train trips to the destinations in this chapter aren’t 
very long, standard-class may be fine for most travelers. For 2 days of 
travel in an 8-day period, the pass costs $209 first class, $113 standard 
class; for 4 days in an 8-day period, it costs $289 first class, $225 standard 
class; and for 7 days of travel in a 15-day period, it costs $369 first class, 
$269 standard class. See BritRail’s Web site for more information on the 
London Plus and other BritRail passes and products.
National train schedules, routes, and fares can be found online at www.
nationalrail.co.uk, or by calling % 0845/484-950.
Taking a car: Driving on the left, passing on the right
I always suggest that people visiting London travel by train instead of 
driving. Much of your car trip will be on motorways without much scenery, 
so what’s the point? Then, when you arrive, you have to find parking (gen-
erally outside the historic city center); if you arrive by train, however, you 
can easily walk to the center of town from the train station (or take a cab 
if you have mobility issues). The historic towns of England are compact 
and centralized — you won’t necessarily need a car to get from point A to 
point B.
Before you even consider renting a car, ask yourself whether you’re 
comfortable driving with a steering wheel on the right-hand side of the 
vehicle while shifting with your left hand (you can get an automatic, but 
it costs considerably more). Remember: You must drive on the left and 
pass on the right.
Although the car rental market in Britain is highly competitive, renting a 
car here costs more than back home — unless you can find a special 
promotional offer from an airline or a car rental agency. Most U.K. car 
rental agencies accept valid foreign driver’s licenses. In most cases, you 
must be 23 years old (21 in some instances), no older than 70, and have 
had your driver’s license for more than a year.
 
 You can often get a discount on car rental rates if you reserve 48 hours in 
advance through the toll-free reservations offices. Weekly rentals are 
almost always less expensive than daily rates. And the rate, of course, 
depends on the size of the vehicle.

 Chapter 14: Going beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 267
When you make your reservation, ask whether the quoted price includes 
the 17.5 percent VAT and unlimited mileage. Then find out whether per-
sonal accident insurance, the collision-damage waiver, and any other 
insurance options are included. If they aren’t a part of the deal, which 
they usually aren’t, be sure to ask how much they cost. When you drive 
in any foreign country (or anywhere, for that matter), arrange for as 
much coverage as possible.
 
 Some credit card companies offer the collision-damage waiver and other 
types of insurance for free, if you use that card to pay for the rental. If 
you’re planning to rent a car, check with your credit card company to see 
what’s covered, or you may end up paying for coverage you already have.
Bath: Roman Spa, Regency Splendor
Bath, 185km (115 miles) west of London, is a beautiful spa town on the 
Avon River (see the “Bath” map on p. 268). Since the days of the ancient 
Celts — and later the Romans, who built an enormous bath complex — 
Bath has been famous for its hot mineral springs. In 1702, Queen Anne 
frequented the soothing, sulfurous waters and transformed Bath into a 
spa for the elite. Aristocrats, socialites, social climbers, and flamboyant 
dandies, such as Beau Nash, have added to the spa’s fashionable and 
fascinating history. The great author Jane Austen used Bath as an 
upwardly genteel setting for her class-conscious plots.
Today, the spa is a grand legacy from the Georgian (Regency) era, graced 
with beautiful curving crescents (attached houses built in a long curving 
line) and classically inspired buildings of honey-colored stone. Must-sees 
are the Roman Baths Museum and adjoining Pump Room (where visitors 
can continue the long tradition of sipping water while listening to music), 
the adjacent Abbey, the Assembly Rooms (once used for balls and 
gaming), and Fashion Museum.
Getting there
Trains for Bath leave from London’s Paddington Station every half-hour; 
the trip takes about 90 minutes. The standard day-return (round-trip) 
fare costs £49 ($81). For schedules, go to www.nationalrail.co.uk 
or call % 08457/484950. By car, take the M4 to Junction 18, and then 
drive a few miles south on A46.
Finding information and taking a tour
Bath’s Tourist Information Centre (% 01225/477-101; www.visitbath.
co.uk), located in the center of town on the square in front of Bath 
Abbey, is open Monday through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. 
in the summer) and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Centre provides free 
guided walks that leave from outside the Pump Room daily at 10:30 a.m. 
and 2 p.m. Additional walks are offered at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Friday, and 
Saturday from May through September.

One-hour, open-top bus tours with audio commentary are presented by 
City Sightseeing (% 01871/666-0000) at a cost of £11 ($18) adults, £8 
($13) seniors and students, and £4.50 ($7.45) for children. Tours depart 
from the bus station every 15 minutes in summer; otherwise, they leave 
hourly. Tickets are valid all day, and you can get off and on to explore 
places along the route.
Seeing the sights
 
 The Romans — who arrived in A.D. 75 — built the huge bath-and-temple 
complex at the center of the Roman Baths Museum (% 01225/477-785; 
www.romanbaths.co.uk). When visitors enter, they receive a portable 
self-guided audio tour keyed to everything on display, including the origi-
nal Roman baths and heating system; the audio tour is fun, informative, 
and very well done. The museum was refurbished in 2009 and now 
includes videos explaining ancient building methods and, in one of the 
bathing areas, ancient Roman bathers drying off after a soak. Admission 
costs £11 ($18) adults, £9.50 ($16) seniors and students, £8 ($13) children 
6 to 16, and £40 ($66) families. The museum is open daily, but the hours 
change seasonally: November to February 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; March to 
June and September to October 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; July to August 9 a.m. to 
10 p.m. It’s closed December 25 and 26.
Overlooking the Roman baths is the late 18th-century Pump Room 
(% 01225/477-7785), where the fashionable assembled to sip the reput-
edly health-promoting water. You’re welcome to taste it for yourself — 
your ticket to the Roman Baths Museum entitles you to one free glass of 
mineral water in the Pump Room. In the Pump Room, you can enjoy elev-
enses (morning tea), lunch, or afternoon tea to a background of live music. 
Main courses cost £11 to £15 ($18–$25); afternoon tea goes for £17 ($28). 
The Pump Room is open Monday through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
(until 10 p.m. July–Aug) and Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Step inside Bath Abbey (% 01225/422-462; www.bathabbey.org) and 
view the graceful fan vaulting, the great East Window, and the ironically 
simple memorial to Beau Nash, the most flamboyant of the dandies who 
frequented Bath in its heyday. Admission is by a suggested donation of 
£2.50 ($4.15). The abbey is open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
(to 4:30 p.m. Nov–Mar) and Sunday 1 to 2:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.
Another classic building worth visiting is the Assembly Rooms on Bennett 
Street (% 01225/477-789), the site of all the grand balls and social climbing 
in 18th-century Bath. Entrance is free, but you won’t be able to enter if an 
event is going on. The excellent Fashion Museum (% 01225/477-173; 
www.fashionmuseum.co.uk), which is part of the Assembly Rooms 
complex, displays a fascinating collection of historic and contemporary 
clothing. Admission for the museum costs £7 ($12) adults; £6.25 ($10) 
seniors, students, and children 6 to 18. The museum is open daily 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. (to 5 p.m. Mar–Oct); the Assembly Rooms are open when 
not in use.

Part IV: Exploring London 
270
The Jane Austen Centre, 40 Gay St. (% 01225/443-000; www.jane
austen.co.uk), dedicated to Bath’s most famous resident, is located 
in a Georgian town house on an elegant street where Austen once lived. 
Exhibits and a video convey a sense of what life in Bath was like during 
the Regency period; all in all, though, this museum is a bit of a bore to all 
but the most avid Austen fans. Admission costs £6.75 ($11). In summer, 
the center is open Monday through Wednesday 9:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
and Thursday through Sunday 9:45 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; the rest of the year, 
it’s open shorter hours (call ahead). Afternoon tea is served in the 
Regency tearooms for £5.95 ($9.80).
 
 Bath is a wonderful walking town, filled with beautiful squares and sweeping 
residential crescents. Stroll along the North Parade and the South Parade, 
Queen Square, and The Circus and be sure to have a look at the Royal 
Crescent, a magnificent, curving row of 30 town houses designed in 1767 by 
John Wood the Younger. Regarded as the epitome of England’s Palladian 
style (a classical style incorporating elements from ancient Greek and 
Roman buildings), the Royal Crescent is now designated a UNESCO World 
Heritage Site. No. 1 Royal Crescent (% 01225/428-126) is a gorgeously 
restored 18th-century house with period furnishings. Admission costs £5 
($8.25). The house is open mid-February through November, Tuesday 
through Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (to 4 p.m. in Nov).
Pulteney Bridge, built in 1770, spans the River Avon a few blocks south 
of the Assembly Rooms. The bridge is one of the few in Europe lined 
with shops and restaurants.
Dining locally
A popular French eatery at the eastern end of Pulteney Bridge, No. 5 
Bistro, 5 Argyle St. (% 01225/444-499), features mouth-watering dishes 
that may include baked ricotta with olive, spinach, and sun-dried tomato 
soufflé; Provençal fish soup; pan-fried pepper steak; or vegetarian 
dishes, such as roasted stuffed peppers and vegetable gratin. Main 
courses cost £12 to £17 ($20–$28). The bistro, open daily noon to 2:30 
p.m. and 6:30 to 10:30 p.m., accepts American Express, MasterCard, and 
Visa.
Spending the night
If you want to spend the night in Bath, try the Kennard Hotel, 11 
Henrietta St. (% 01225/310-472; www.kennard.co.uk). On the east 
side of Pulteney Bridge, within walking distance of everything in Bath, 
this elegant hotel with 13 guest rooms occupies a beautifully restored 
1794 Georgian town house. The rates are £98 to £118 ($162–$195) 
double, breakfast included. The hotel accepts American Express, 
MasterCard, and Visa.

 Chapter 14: Going beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 271
Brighton: Fun beside the Seaside
On the Sussex coast, a mere 80km (50 miles) south of London, Brighton 
is England’s most famous, and probably most popular, seaside town (see 
the “Brighton” map on p. 272). Brighton was a small fishing village until 
the Prince Regent, who would become George IV, became enamored 
with the place and had the incredible Royal Pavilion built. Where royalty 
moves, fashion follows, and Brighton eventually became one of Europe’s 
most fashionable towns. The lovely Georgian terraces that you see 
everywhere date from this period. Later in the 19th century, when 
breathing sea air was prescribed as a cure-all for everything from 
depression to tuberculosis, the Victorians descended in hordes. Today, 
Brighton is a commuter suburb of London and a popular place for con-
ventions and romantic weekend getaways. Gays and lesbians are very 
much a part of the local and visitor scene.
Brighton is a compact town, and the easiest way to get around is on foot. 
Forget about that frantic need for sightseeing and relax. Relaxation is 
what Brighton is all about. This place is for leisurely strolling, either in 
the town or along the seaside promenades. The town is small enough so 
you won’t get lost and large enough to offer some good cultural diversions.
Getting there
More than 40 trains a day leave from London’s Victoria Station for 
Brighton. The trip takes about an hour. If you travel off-peak (after 9:30 
a.m.), a cheap day-return (round-trip) ticket costs about £19 ($31). For 
schedules, go to www.nationalrail.co.uk or call % 0845/484-950. If 
you’re driving, follow the M23 from Central London; it leads to Brighton. 
The drive typically takes about an hour, but if roads are clogged, it may 
take twice as long.
Finding information
Brighton’s Visitor Information Centre, Royal Pavilion Shop, 4–5 Pavilion 
Buildings (% 0906/711-2255; www.visitbrighton.com), in the Royal 
Pavilion, is about a ten-minute walk south from the train station. The 
center is a good place to pick up info on current events (including a Gay 
Information Sheet, listing gay guesthouses, pubs, and clubs). If you fall in 
love with Brighton and decide to stay overnight, you can reserve a room 
through this office. The center is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Seeing the sights
 
 Brighton’s one must-see attraction is the Royal Pavilion (% 01273/290-
900; www.royalpavilion.org.uk), set in a small landscaped park 
bounded by North Street, Church Street, Olde Steine, and New Road. The 
pavilion is one of the most extraordinary palaces in Europe. John Nash 
redesigned the original farmhouse and villa on this site for George IV 
(when the king was still Prince Regent), who lived here with his mistress, 
Lady Conyngham, until 1827.

The exterior, as crazily wonderful as anything King Ludwig of Bavaria 
dreamed up, is an Indian fantasy of turrets and minarets. The interior, 
decorated in a Chinese style, is fantastically extravagant. The king’s 
brother, William IV, and Queen Victoria later used the pavilion. 
Admission, which includes an audio guide, costs £8.80 ($15) adults, 
£6.90 ($11) seniors and students, £5.10 ($8.40) children under 16, and 
£21 ($35) families (2 adults and 2 children). The pavilion is open daily 
October through May from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and June through 
September 9:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.
 
 Before you leave the pavilion, consider having lunch or a cream tea (tea 
and scones served with clotted cream and strawberry preserves) in the 
restored Queen Adelaide Tea Room (% 01723/292-736), open daily 
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (to 5 p.m. in summer). Queen Adelaide, who used 
this suite in 1830, didn’t appreciate the epicurean tastes of her husband, 
George IV. Dismissing his renowned French chefs, she reverted back to 

 Chapter 14: Going beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 273
British cuisine so dreary that Lord Dudley complained “you now get cold 
pâté and hot champagne.” The lunch selections and cream teas range 
from £7 to £15 ($12–$25).
Close to the Royal Pavilion, on Church Street, you find the small 
Brighton Museum & Art Gallery (% 01273/292-882), with some inter-
esting collections of Art Nouveau and Art Deco furniture, glass, and 
ceramics, plus a Fashion Gallery. Reopened in 2002 after a major refur-
bishment, it’s a good place to wile away an hour. Admission is free, and 
it’s open Tuesday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Wednesday through Saturday 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 2 to 5 p.m. (closed Dec 24–26 and Jan 1).
The town’s famous amusement area, Palace Pier, jutting out into the sea 
just south of the Royal Pavilion, was built in the late 19th century. Today 
the pier is rather tacky but worth visiting nonetheless. At night, all lit up 
with twinkling lights, this place is almost irresistible. Spend half an hour, 
but don’t expect to find much more than junk food, kiddie rides, and 
arcade games. The more famous West Pier, now over 130 years old and 
gradually sinking into the sea, isn’t open to the public.
Brighton and neighboring Hove stretch out along the English Channel. 
The entire seafront is a pebbly public beach used for swimming and sun-
ning. Promenades for strolling are all along the seafront. If you’re into sun-
bathing au naturel, Brighton has the only nude beach in England, about a 
mile west of Brighton Pier. You’ll recognize it when you get there.
Dining locally
One of the hippest and friendliest places for dining is Jamie’s Italian, 11 
Black Lion St. (% 01273/634-539). Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver opened this 
Brighton restaurant in 2009, and it immediately became the hottest dining 
spot in town. It’s not fancy or pretentious, and you may have to wait for a 
table at dinnertime because it doesn’t take reservations. The food here is 
fresh and local (as much as possible), and the preparation is simple and 
unfussy. Try one of the classic pasta dishes, fresh grilled fish, or a grilled 
steak. The food is complemented by a good wine list. Main courses cost 
£7 to £14 ($12–$23). Jamie’s is open daily from noon to 11 p.m. and 
accepts American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
 
 For a new outlook on vegetarian food, try Terre à Terre, 71 East St. 
(% 01273/729-051; www.terreaterre.co.uk). Considered the best 
vegetarian restaurant in England, perhaps in all Europe, this place ele-
vates meatless cuisine to an art form. The food is impeccably fresh and 
beautifully presented. You can eat your way through the menu with the 
Terre à Tapas, a superb selection of all its best dishes, big enough for two. 
Main courses cost £13 to £15 ($21–$25). The restaurant is open Tuesday 
6:30 to 10:30 p.m., and Wednesday through Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m. 
Reservations are essential on weekends. The restaurant accepts Diners 
Club, MasterCard, and Visa.

Spending the night
 
 The sophisticated and stylish Hotel du Vin & Bistro, Ship Street 
(% 01273/718-588; www.hotelduvin.com), occupies a set of Mock Tudor 
and Gothic Revival buildings a stone’s throw from the seafront. With an 
impressive three-story lobby, a signature French bistro (excellent dining), 
and 37 cool, uncluttered, and very comfortable bedrooms featuring marvel-
ous beds with fine Egyptian linens, deep soaker tubs, and power showers, 
this is a place to savor. Rack rates for a double room with breakfast range 
from £145 to £250 ($240–$413). The hotel accepts all major credit cards.
Canterbury: Tales from the Great Cathedral
Magnificent Canterbury Cathedral is one of the glories of England. For 
nearly 400 years, the devout, in search of miracles, salvation, and a bit 
of adventure, trekked to the cathedral’s shrine of Thomas à Becket, 
Archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered in 1170 by henchmen of 
Henry II. Along the way, they spun the yarns found in Chaucer’s The 
Canterbury Tales. (The pilgrims didn’t stop coming until Henry VIII had the 
shrine destroyed in 1538.) Modern pilgrims, today called day-trippers, 
continue to pour into the Kentish city of Canterbury on the River Stour, 
100km (62 miles) east of London. They come to see the cathedral, of 
course, but also to visit the host of small museums and to enjoy the pic-
turesque town surrounding it.
Getting there
Canterbury has two train stations, Canterbury East and Canterbury 
West, and you can easily walk to the city center from either one. From 
London’s Victoria Station, trains run about every half-hour to 
Canterbury East. Hourly trains from London’s Charing Cross stop at 
Canterbury West. The journey takes 90 minutes and costs about £19 
($31) for a cheap day-return (round-trip) ticket. For schedules, go to 
www.nationalrail.co.uk or call % 0845/484-950. To drive from 
London, take the A2 and then the M2; Canterbury is signposted all the 
way. The city center is closed to cars, but several parking areas are 
close to the cathedral.
Finding information and taking a tour
The Visitors Information Centre, 12–13 Sun St. (% 01227/378100; www.
canterbury.co.uk), opposite Christchurch Gate, at the entrance to 
the cathedral precincts, is open Easter through October, Monday 
through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; the 
rest of the year, the center is open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 
4 p.m. At the Centre, you can buy tickets for daily guided-tour walks of 
the city and cathedral at 2 p.m. (additional walks July–Aug, Mon–Sat 
11:30 a.m.). The tour costs £4.50 ($7.45) adults, £4 ($6.60) seniors and 
students, £3 ($4.95) for children 11 and under, and £15 ($25) families (2 
adults and 2 children).

Canterbury Historic River Tours, Weavers House, 1 St. Peter’s St. 
(% 07790/534-744; www.canterburyrivertours.co.uk), offers half-
hour boat trips on the Stour River, with a commentary on the history of 
the buildings that you pass. April through September, river conditions 
permitting, boats depart daily every 15 to 20 minutes from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Tickets cost £7 ($12) adults, £6 ($9.90) seniors and students, £4.50 
($7.45) children, and £20 ($33) families (2 adults and 2 children). 
Umbrellas are available in case of rain. The boats leave from behind 
the 15th-century Weavers House (access via the Weavers restaurant 
garden).
Seeing the sights
 
 Make your first stop the imposing Canterbury Cathedral, 11 The 
Precincts (% 01227/762-862; www.canterbury-cathedral.org), a 
magnificent structure that was the first major expression of the Gothic 
style in England. The crypt dates from about 1100, and the cathedral 

Part IV: Exploring London 
276
itself (rebuilt after a fire) dates from the 13th century, with a bell tower 
added in the 15th century.
Although Henry VIII destroyed Becket’s shrine, its site is still marked in 
the Trinity Chapel near the high altar. Noteworthy features of the cathe-
dral include a number of panels of rare stained glass and the medieval 
royal tombs of Henry IV and Edward the Black Prince. Admission costs 
£7.50 ($12) adults; £6.50 ($11) seniors, students, and children. The 
cathedral is open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (until 5 
p.m. in winter), and Sunday 12:30 to 2:30 p.m.; it’s closed to sightseeing 
during services.
As you stroll the cathedral grounds, you may encounter flocks of well-
behaved boys and girls wearing blazers and ties: They attend King’s 
School, the oldest public school in England, housed in several fine medi-
eval buildings north of the cathedral.
Off High Street, near the cathedral, is the entertaining exhibition known 
as The Canterbury Tales, 23 St. Margaret’s St. (% 01227/454-888; www.
canterburytales.org.uk), where the pilgrimages of Chaucerian 
England are re-created in tableaux. On audio headsets, you can hear five 
of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and the story of the murder of St. Thomas 
à Becket. Give yourself 45 minutes to an hour to see and hear the entire 
show. Admission costs £7.75 ($13) adults, £6.75 ($11) seniors and stu-
dents, £5.75 ($9.50) children 5 to 15. The attraction is open daily 10 a.m. 
to 4:30 p.m. (9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. in summer).
Two millennia ago, the conquering Romans were living in Canterbury, 
which they called Cantuaria. Their daily lives are chronicled in the small 
but fascinating Roman Museum (% 01227/785-575), in the excavated 
Roman levels of the city between the cathedral and High Street on 
Butchery Lane. Admission costs £3.10 ($5.10) adults; £2.10 ($3.45) 
seniors, students, and children. The museum is open Monday through 
Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday 1:30 to 4 p.m.
Although the cathedral gets the lion’s share of attention in Canterbury, 
another Christian site predates it by about 600 years. Set in a spacious 
park, about a ten-minute walk east from the center of town, you find the 
atmospheric ruins of St. Augustine’s Abbey (Longport; % 01227/767-345), 
founded in A.D. 598 and one of the oldest Anglo-Saxon monastic sites in 
the country. This UNESCO World Heritage site offers interactive audio 
tours. Admission costs £4.30 ($7.10) adults, £3.70 ($6.10) seniors and 
students, £2.20 ($3.65) children. The site is open April through June 
Wednesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; July and August daily 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m.; September through March Sundays 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Trek another five minutes east from St. Augustine’s Abbey to visit the 
oldest parish church in England. St. Martin’s Church, North Holmes 
Road (% 01227/459-482), founded by Queen Bertha (the French wife of 
Saxon King Ethelbert), was already in existence when Augustine arrived 

 Chapter 14: Going beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 277
from Rome to convert the natives in A.D. 597. Admission is free, and the 
church is open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Dining locally
One of the best dining spots in Canterbury is Michael Caines Restaurant, 
located in the newly refurbished Abode on High Street (% 01227/766-266). 
You can choose from a selection of simple but imaginatively conceived 
dishes and seasonal specialties. Reservations are recommended. Main 
courses go for £14 to £20 ($23–$33). You can dine on more traditional 
pub fare in the Tavern, where prices run from £8 to £15 ($13–$25).The 
restaurant accepts American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and 
Visa. It’s open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Spending the night
If you’re planning an overnight stay in Canterbury and want, like the pil-
grims of yore, to stay near the cathedral, you can’t get any closer than the 
Cathedral Gate Hotel, 36 Burgate (% 01227/464-381; www.cathgate.
co.uk). Dating from 1438, the 27-room hotel adjoins Christchurch Gate 
and overlooks the Buttermarket. The guest rooms are comfortable and 
modestly furnished, with sloping floors, massive oak beams, and winding 
corridors — what else would you expect from a hotel built more than 500 
years ago? With the cheapest rooms, you’ll be sharing a bathroom. Rates 
are £74 to £103 ($122–$170) double, continental breakfast included. The 
hotel accepts American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
Stratford-upon-Avon: In the 
Footsteps of the Bard
Stratford-upon-Avon (see the “Stratford-upon-Avon” map on p. 278) is a 
shrine to the world’s greatest playwright, William Shakespeare, who was 
born, lived much of his life, and is buried in this market town on the Avon 
River, 146km (91 miles) northwest of London. In summer, crowds of 
international tourists overrun Stratford, which aggressively hustles its 
Shakespeare connection.
Stratford is comprised of many Elizabethan and Jacobean buildings, but 
it’s not really a quaint village anymore. If you’re arriving by train, your 
first glimpse will be of a vast parking lot across from the station. Don’t 
let this sight put you off. The charms of Stratford haven’t been completely 
lost — it still has lots of lovely corners to discover. Besides the literary 
pilgrimage sights, the top draw in Stratford is the Royal Shakespeare 
Theatre, where Britain’s foremost actors perform.

Getting there
Direct trains leave frequently from London’s Marylebone Station; the jour-
ney takes two hours and costs £30 ($50) for a standard-class off-peak 
(after 9:30 a.m.) round-trip ticket. For schedules, go to www.national
rail.co.uk or call % 0845/484-950. To drive from London, take the 
M40 toward Oxford and continue to Stratford-upon-Avon on the A34.
Finding information and taking a tour
Stratford’s Tourist Information Centre, on Bridgefoot (% 0870/160-
7930; www.shakespeare-country.co.uk), provides information and 
maps of the town and its major sites. The center is open Monday 
through Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 5 p.m. in winter) and Sunday 11 
a.m. to 5 p.m. (10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. in winter).
Bus tours of Stratford, provided by City Sightseeing (% 01708/866-
000), leave from outside the tourist office. Open-top, double-decker 
buses depart every 15 minutes daily 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in summer 
(until 3:30 p.m. the rest of the year). You can take the one-hour ride 
without stops or get off and on at any or all of the town’s five Shakespeare 
properties, including Mary Arden’s House in Wilmcote (see the following 
section). The tour ticket is valid all day but doesn’t include admission into 
any of the houses. The tours cost £11 ($18) adults, £9 ($15) seniors and 
students, and £6 ($9.90) children 11 and under. You can buy your ticket 
on the bus.
Seeing the sights
 
 One ticket gets you into the three town sites administered by the 
Shakespeare Birthplace Trust: Shakespeare’s Birthplace, New Place/
Nash’s House, and Hall’s Croft. The ticket costs £12 ($20) adults, £11 
($18) seniors and students, £7 ($12) children, £31 ($51) families (2 adults 
and 3 children). You can purchase individual tickets to see Anne 
Hathaway’s Cottage and Mary Arden’s House.
A logical place to begin your tour is Shakespeare’s Birthplace, Henley 
Street (% 01789-204016; www.shakespeare.org.uk), where the bard, 
son of a glover and wool merchant, first saw the light of day on April 23, 
1564. You enter through the modern Shakespeare Centre, where you 
can spend a few minutes browsing the exhibits that illustrate his life and 
times. The house, filled with Shakespeare memorabilia, is actually two 
16th-century half-timbered houses joined together. His father’s shop was 
on one side, and the family residence was on the other. After visiting the 
bedroom where wee Willie was (probably) born, the Elizabethan kitchen, 
and other rooms, you can walk through the garden. Shakespeare’s 
Birthplace is open daily April through October 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and 
November through March 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It’s closed December 24 
through 26.

Part IV: Exploring London 
280
To visit Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, on Cottage Lane in Shottery (% 01789/
292-100), about a mile south of Stratford, take a bus from Bridge Street 
or, better yet, walk there along the well-marked country path from 
Evesham Place. Anne Hathaway, who came from a family of yeomen 
farmers, lived in this lovely thatched cottage before she married 18-year-
old Shakespeare (a May-December marriage, as Anne was 25). Many 
original 16th-century furnishings, including the courting settle (a type of 
bench that courting couples often sat on), are preserved inside the house, 
which was occupied by Anne’s ancestors until 1892. Before leaving, be 
sure to stroll through the beautiful garden and orchard. Admission costs 
£6.50 ($11) adults, £5.50 ($9.10) seniors and students, £3.50 ($5.80) chil-
dren, and £16 ($26) families (2 adults and 3 children). The cottage is 
open daily April through October 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and November 
through March 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It’s closed January 1, Good Friday (Fri 
before Easter), and December 24 through 26.
Shakespeare retired in 1610 to New Place, Chapel Street (% 01789/
204-016). By that time, he was a relatively prosperous man whose plays 
had been seen by Queen Elizabeth. New Place was a Stratford house that 
he’d purchased a few years earlier and where he would die in 1616. The 
house was later torn down and, today, only the gardens remain. To 
reach the site from his birthplace, walk east on Henley Street and south 
on High Street, which becomes Chapel Street. Visitors enter through 
Nash’s House, which belonged to Thomas Nash, husband of 
Shakespeare’s granddaughter. The house contains 16th-century period 
rooms and an exhibit illustrating the history of Stratford. Adjoining the 
house is a knot garden landscaped in an Elizabethan style. Hours are 
daily April through October 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., November through March 
11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Shakespeare’s daughter Susanna probably lived with her husband, Dr. 
John Hall, in Hall’s Croft, Old Town (% 01789/292-107), a magnificent 
Tudor house with a walled garden. From New Place, continue south on 
Chapel and Church streets and turn east on Old Town to reach Hall’s 
Croft. The house is furnished in the style of a middle-class 17th-century 
home. On view are exhibits illustrating the theory and practice of medi-
cine in Dr. Hall’s time. Hours are the same as for Nash’s House (see the 
preceding paragraph).
Shakespeare died on his birthday, at age 52, and was buried in Holy 
Trinity Church, Old Town (% 01789/266-316; www.stratford-upon-
avon.org), a beautiful parish church beside the Avon River. His wife, 
Anne, his daughter Susanna, and Susanna’s husband, John Hall, lie beside 
him in front of the altar. A bust of the immortal bard looks down upon the 
gravesite. I find it a bit odd that the inscription on the tomb of the man 
who wrote some of the world’s most enduring lines is little more than dog-
gerel, ending with “and curst be he who moves my bones.” Obviously 
William Shakespeare didn’t want to leave Stratford — ever. Admission to 
the church is free, but a small donation (£1.50/$2.50) is requested to see 
Shakespeare’s tomb. You can visit the church March through October 

 Chapter 14: Going beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 281
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 12:30 to 5 p.m.; April 
through September, Monday through Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., 
Sunday 12:30 to 5 p.m.; November through February Monday through 
Saturday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday 12:30 to 5 p.m. It’s closed December 24 
through 26, January 1, and Easter.
About 5km (31⁄2 miles) north of Stratford on the A34 (Birmingham) road 
in Wilmcote is Mary Arden’s House & Shakespeare Countryside Museum 
(% 01789/204-016), the last of the five Shakespeare shrines. For more 
than 200 years, Palmers Farm, a Tudor farmstead with an old stone 
dovecote and outbuildings, was identified as the girlhood home of Mary 
Arden, Shakespeare’s mother. Recent evidence revealed, however, that 
Mary Arden actually lived in the house next door, at Glebe Farm. In 2000, 
the house at Glebe Farm was officially re-designated as the Mary Arden 
House. Dating from 1514, the house contains country furniture and 
domestic utensils; in the barns, stable, cowshed, and farmyard, you find 
an extensive collection of farming implements illustrating life and work in 
the local countryside from Shakespeare’s time to the present. Admission 
costs £8 ($13) adults, £7 ($12) seniors and students, £5 ($8.25) children, £21
($35) families (2 adults and 3 children). Hours are November through 
March daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and April through October 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Seeing a play at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre
 
 The Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Waterside (% 01789/295-623; www.
rsc.org.uk), is the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), 
which typically stages five Shakespeare plays during a season, running 
from November through September. (For current offerings, and to book 
tickets online, visit the Web site.) A few tickets are always held for sale on 
the day of a performance, but if you wait until you arrive in Stratford, you 
may not be able to get a good seat. The box office is open Monday through 
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. but closes at 6 p.m. on days when no perfor-
mances are on the schedule. Tickets cost £8 to £46 ($13–$76). Note: The 
main RSC theater is closed for restoration from 2007 to 2010; in the mean-
time, performances are being held at the Swan and Courtyard theaters.
Dining locally
 If you want to have lunch or afternoon tea in enjoyably old-fashioned 
surroundings, try Hathaway Tea Rooms & Bakery, 19 High St. 
(% 01789/292-404). The tearooms are on the second floor of a building 
that dates from 1610. Cream tea comes with homemade fruit scones, clot-
ted cream, and jam, and high tea includes a variety of sandwiches. You 
can also get an English breakfast and light meals throughout the day. Main 
courses run from £7 to £9 ($12–$15); cream teas cost £6 ($9.90); and high 
teas cost £8 ($13). There’s a kids’ menu for £5 ($8.25). Credit cards are not 
accepted. The tearooms are open daily 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

The Oppo, 13 Sheep St. (% 01789/269-980; www.theoppo.co.uk), 
housed in a 16th-century building in the heart of Stratford, offers a historic 
setting and a mix of traditional and Modern British cuisine. Reservations are 
recommended. Main courses run from £11 to £15 ($18–$25); a fixed-price 
meal costs £15 ($25). The restaurant accepts MasterCard and Visa, and 
it’s open daily noon to 2 p.m. and 5 to 11 p.m.
Spending the night
During the long theater season, reserve in advance if you’re planning to 
sleep, perchance to dream, in Stratford. However, the Tourist Information 
Centre, Bridgefoot (% 0870/160-7930), can help you find accommodations.
 
 Mercure Shakespeare Hotel Stratford, Chapel Street (% 01789/294997; 
www.mercure.com), successfully blends old and new. Parts of this cen-
trally located hotel date from 1635 and preserve the original Tudor Era 
beams and stone floor, but all 74 rooms were completely refurbished in 
2005 in a comfortably elegant and traditional style. The rooms come with 
a host of modern amenities, and all the bathrooms have bathtubs with 
showers. Rack rates for a double, with English breakfast included, range 
from £100 to £210 ($165–$347). The hotel accepts all major credit cards.
 
 Hamlet House, 52 Grove Rd. (% 01789/204386; www.hamlethouse.
com), a small, unpretentious, well-maintained B&B, is a three-minute walk 
from the train station and close to everything else in Stratford. Two of its 
five guestrooms have private bathrooms; the others share a toilet and 
shower. A double room with English breakfast costs £50 to £60 ($83–$99). 
No credit cards are accepted.
Salisbury and Stonehenge: Steeples 
and Standing Stones
The tall, slender spire of Salisbury Cathedral rises up from the plains of 
Wiltshire, like a finger pointing toward the heavens. Salisbury (see the 
“Salisbury” map on p. 283), or New Sarum as it was once called, lies in 
the valley of the Avon River, 145km (90 miles) southwest of London. 
Filled with Tudor inns and tearooms and dominated by its beautiful 
cathedral, this old market town is often overlooked by visitors eager to 
see Stonehenge, about 15km (9 miles) away.
Getting there
From London’s Waterloo Station, trains run hourly to Salisbury; the 
journey takes about 90 minutes and costs about £30 ($50) for an off-peak 
(after 9:30 a.m.) round-trip ticket. For schedules, go to www.national
rail.co.uk or call % 0845/484-950. If you’re driving from London, 
head west on the M3 to the end of the run, continuing the rest of the way 
on the A30.

Finding information
Salisbury’s Tourist Information Centre is on Fish Row (% 01722/334-
956; www.visitsalisbury.com) and is open Monday through 
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. June–Sept); from May through 
September, it’s also open Sunday 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Seeing the sights
Visitors eager to see Stonehenge often overlook the lovely old market 
town of Salisbury, but I suggest that you try to spend a bit of time 
wandering through Salisbury Cathedral.
Salisbury
In 2008, Salisbury Cathedral, The Close (% 01722/555-120; www.
salisburycathedral.org.uk), celebrated its 750th anniversary. 

Part IV: Exploring London 
284
Despite an ill-conceived renovation in the 18th century, the 13th-century 
structure remains the best example in England of Early English and 
Perpendicular Gothic style. The 123m (404-ft.) spire is the tallest in the 
country. The beautiful 13th-century, octagonal chapter house has one of 
the four surviving original texts of the Magna Carta. Adding to the serene 
beauty of the cathedral are the cloisters and an exceptionally large 
close, comprising about 75 buildings. The suggested donation for admis-
sion is £5 ($8.25) adults, £4.50 ($7.45) seniors and students, £3 ($4.95) 
children, and £15 ($25) families. The cathedral is open daily from 7:15 
a.m. to 6:15 p.m. (until 7:15 p.m. June–Aug).
 Wilton House (% 01722/746-720; www.wiltonhouse.co.uk), in the 
town of Wilton, 5km (3 miles) west of Salisbury on the A30, is one of 
England’s great country estates. The home of the earls of Pembroke, the 
house is noted for its 17th-century staterooms by the celebrated architect 
Inigo Jones. Shakespeare’s troupe is believed to have entertained here. 
Several centuries later in this house, General Eisenhower and his advisers 
made preparations for the D-day landings at Normandy. Beautifully main-
tained furnishings and paintings by Brueghel, Reynolds, Rubens, and Van 
Dyck fill the house. You can visit a reconstructed Tudor kitchen and 
Victorian laundry, plus the Wareham Bears, a collection of some 200 min-
iature dressed teddy bears. The 21-acre grounds include rose and water 
gardens, riverside and woodland walks, and a huge adventure playground 
for children. Admission costs £12 ($20) adults, £9.75 ($16) seniors, £6.50 
($11) children 5 to 15, and £30 ($50) families (2 adults and 2 children). The 
house and grounds are open Sunday through Thursday May through 
August noon to 5 p.m. (last admission 4:30 p.m.; occasional closings). If 
you don’t have a car, you can take the bus that stops on New Canal, a ten-
minute walk north of Salisbury train station; check with the tourist office 
for schedules and to be certain that the house is open that day.
 Stonehenge
 About 15km (9 miles) north of Salisbury, at the junction of the A303 and 
the A344/A360, you find one of the world’s most renowned prehistoric 
sites and one of England’s most popular attractions, the prehistoric stone 
circle known as Stonehenge (% 01980/624-715; www.stonehenge.
co.uk). If you’re not driving, hop on one of the Wilts & Dorset 
(% 01202/673-555; www.wdbus.co.uk) buses that depart from the 
Salisbury train station daily between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.; the trip takes 
about 40 minutes, and the round-trip fare costs about £7 ($12). The 
crowds can be overwhelming as the day wears on, so arrive as early as 
possible.
Stonehenge is a stone circle of megalithic pillars and lintels built on the 
flat Salisbury Plain. Archaeological dating has shown that the site was 
built in stages from 5,000 to 3,500 years ago. Many visitors to Stonehenge 
are disappointed to find that the standing stones (now surrounded by a 
barrier that keeps sightseers 15m/50 ft. away) aren’t as enormous as 
they envisioned. Keep in mind, however, that many of the stones, which 
weigh several tons, were mined and moved from distant quarries in a 

 Chapter 14: Going beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 285
time before forklifts, trucks, and dynamite. It was quite literally a 
colossal achievement.
Stonehenge was a shrine and/or ceremonial gathering place of some 
kind. The old belief that Stonehenge was built by the Druids has been 
discredited (it’s probably older than the Celtic Druids). A popular 
theory is that the site was an astronomical observatory, because it’s 
aligned to the summer solstice and can accurately predict eclipses 
based on the placement of the stones. But in an age when experts think 
they know everything, Stonehenge still keeps its tantalizing mysteries to 
itself. Recent archaeological evidence has uncovered another ceremonial 
avenue and leads experts to speculate that Stonehenge was an impor-
tant burial place. Admission costs £6.60 ($11) adults, £5.60 ($9.25) 
seniors and students, and £3.30 ($5.80) children. The site is open daily 
March 16 through May, and September through October 15, from 9:30 
a.m. to 6 p.m.; June through August from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and October 
16 to March 15 from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Dining locally
 Put a great French bistro in a lovely old English tavern and you come up 
with Gastrobistro at the Pheasant Inn, 17 Salt Lane (% 01722/414926), a 
favorite with locals and tourists since it opened in 2006. The menu has a 
bit of everything, from French specialties like cassoulet, bouillabaisse, or 
tarte tatin; to comfort foods like burgers and salads; or fresh seafood such 
as scallops or crayfish. There’s a kid’s menu, too. Main courses go for £8 
to £15 ($13–$25); there’s also a fixed-price lunch menu available Monday 
through Friday for £7 ($12). Gastrobistro is open Monday through 
Saturday noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 9:30 p.m., Sunday noon to 2:30 p.m. All 
major credit cards are accepted.
Haunch of Venison, 1 Minster St. (% 01722/322-024), is a creaky-
timbered, wonderfully atmospheric, 1320 chophouse and pub. The menu 
at the third-floor restaurant features some good dishes, including many 
traditional favorites. Main courses go for £7.50 to £15 ($12–$25). It accepts 
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. Do check out the ancient pub 
rooms, even if you don’t dine here. The pub is open Monday through 
Saturday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night
A Salisbury landmark since Georgian times, the Mercure White Hart 
Hotel, 1 St. John St. (% 01722/327478; www.mercure-uk.com), was 
totally renovated in 2007. The hotel offers accommodations in the older 
section of the building or in a new motel-like section in the rear. A good 
restaurant is on-site. Rates range from £100 to £160 ($165–$264) double. 
The hotel accepts American Express, MasterCard, and Visa.
Atmosphere fills every nook and cranny of the Best Western Red Lion 
Hotel, Milford Street (% 01722/323-334; www.the-redlion.co.uk), 
founded more than 750 years ago. The cozy lounge is a popular spot for 

Part IV: Exploring London 
286
286
286
tea, and, in good weather, the vine-covered courtyard is a pleasant place 
for drinks. Although now part of the Best Western chain, the hotel has 
maintained its own venerable identity. Each guest room is uniquely fur-
nished, some with fireplaces and four-poster beds. Double rooms with 
breakfast cost £90 to £110 ($149–$182). The hotel accepts American 
Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
York: Ancient Walls and Snickelways
York is only 314km (195 miles) north of London, close enough for a day 
trip but worlds apart in character. York (see the “York” map on p. 287) 
is the capital of the north and one of England’s most historic cities. 
Under the Romans, who built a major fort here, the city was known as 
Eboracum. For hundreds of years after that, York was a thriving Viking 
settlement called Jorvik. And finally, after the Norman Conquest, it 
became York, queen of the north. Interesting museums, historic build-
ings of all kinds, good hotels, excellent shops, and fine restaurants make 
York a popular tourist city, and rightly so. Enormous York Minster, the 
largest Gothic structure north of the Alps, dominates the city. And, 
amazingly, the old town’s 800-year-old walls and fortified gateways still 
girdle the old town center. Soak up the city’s history while exploring its 
maze of ancient streets and snickelways (hidden alleyways); you can get 
everywhere on foot and see many attractions in just a day.
Getting to York
To make York work as a day trip, you need to take one of the fast, direct 
trains from London’s King’s Cross Station that will get you there in two 
hours. The standard round-trip fare costs about £60 ($99), but lower 
fares are usually available. For train schedules and information, call 
National Rail Enquiries at % 08457/484-950, or go to www.national
rail.com. The train station is a five-minute walk from York’s historic 
center.
If you need a taxi, contact Station Taxis (% 01904/623-332).
Finding information and taking a tour
At both of the following places, you can get an inexpensive guidebook 
with a map, book a room, and obtain information on guided tours:
 
✓ A convenient branch of the Tourist Information Centre (no phone) 
is right in the train station. The office is open Monday through 
Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. in summer), Sunday 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. (until 5 p.m. in summer).
 
✓ The main Tourist Information Centre, Museum Street (% 01904/
550-099; www.visityork.org), near York Minster, has the same 
opening hours as the train station branch.

More guided tours are offered in York than in just about any other city 
in England, excluding London. You can explore the city by foot, bus, or 
boat. If you’re staying overnight, see my list of evening Ghost Walks at 
the end of the chapter. Here are some of your daytime options:
 
 
✓ The York Association of Voluntary Guides (% 01904/640-780; 
www.york.touristguides.btinternet.co.uk) presents free 
two-hour guided tours of the city. The tours depart daily at 10:15 a.m. 
year-round from Exhibition Square in the city center. Additional tours 

Part IV: Exploring London 
288
288
start at 2:15 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. in summer. You don’t need to make a 
reservation; just show up.
 
✓ During the summer, you can hire a horse-drawn carriage in front of 
the Dean Court Hotel near York Minster. A 15-minute ride around 
the cathedral close (the walled precinct surrounding the cathedral) 
costs £5 ($8.25) adults, £3.50 ($5.80) children.
 
✓ Departing from the pier below Lendal Bridge, York Boat (% 01904/
647-204; www.yorkboat.co.uk) provides a 45-minute tour with 
live commentary that nicely complements a walking tour. From 
mid-February through November, at least four boats depart each 
day; you can buy your ticket onboard. The tour costs £7 ($12) 
adults, £6 ($9.90) seniors, £3.30 ($5.45) children 5 to 15, and £20 
($33) families (2 adults, 3 children).
 
✓ City Sightseeing (% 01904/625-618) runs open-top, double-decker 
tour buses on a circuit of all the main sights in York (1 hour total). 
The ticket, valid all day so you can hop on and off as you want, 
costs £10 ($17) adults, £7 ($12) seniors and students, £4 ($6.60) 
children 5 to 15, and £20 ($33) families (2 adults, 2 children). The 
buses run year-round from about 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; you can get on 
at the train station and buy your ticket from the driver.
Seeing the sights
York is a delightful city to explore, with its old streets, lanes, snickel-
ways, and many tourist attractions. You’ll find more to do here than you 
could ever fit into a one-day excursion, so be selective and keep a map 
with you, because you can easily get lost on the city’s medieval streets. 
(Note: The attractions below are listed in order of their overall interest.)
 
 Awesome York Minster, Minster Yard (% 01904/557-216; www.york
minster.org), the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe, was built 
between 1220 and 1472. Architecturally, it spans the entire range of Gothic 
style: Early English (1220–1260), Decorated (1280–1350), and Perpendicular 
(1361–1472).
The chief cathedral in the north of England, York Minster (see the “York 
Minster” map on p. 289) contains half of all the medieval stained glass in 
the country. The Five Sisters’ Window from 1260 is the oldest complete 
window in the Minster. (Minster, by the way, means a church, usually 
with cathedral status, attached to a monastery.) The Great West Window, 
painted in 1338 and set in heart-shaped tracery, is known as the “Heart of 
Yorkshire.” Above the south door, a magnificent Rose Window (1500) 
commemorates the union of the royal houses of Lancaster and York. 
Painted in 1310, the Jesse Window in the south nave depicts Jesus’ 
family tree. The Minster’s Decorated Gothic nave (the main central 
space in the interior), begun in 1291 and finished in the 1350s, is one of 
Europe’s widest. A 15th-century Choir Screen decorated with statues of 
15 kings of England separates the nave from the choir. In the south tran-
sept, you can descend into the Undercroft, where excavations have

revealed the Roman basilica (an assembly hall, not a Christian church) 
that stood here nearly 2,000 years ago. You can take a well-designed 
“time walk” to see Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman remains. The walk 
leads to the 12th-century Crypt and the Treasury, where silver plate and 
other church treasures are on display. From the nave, a separate entrance 
leads to the 13th-century Chapter House, filled with fine stone carvings 
and medieval glass. You can also ascend the minster’s soaring tower for a 
bird’s-eye view of York and the surrounding region. Give yourself at least 
an hour to see everything in the cathedral. Admission to the Minster, 
undercroft, treasury, crypt, and tower is £9.50 ($16) adults, £7.50 ($12) 
seniors and students, and £3 ($4.95) children. The Minster is open 
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Sunday noon to 4 p.m.
In Minster Yard, you’ll find the Treasurer’s House (% 01904/624-247), 
an elegant town house that was originally the home of the treasurer of 
York Minster. Built in 1620, the house was extensively remodeled during 
the Victorian Era by an eccentric Yorkshireman who cared so passionately 
about interior décor that he threatened to return to haunt the place if 

Part IV: Exploring London 
290
anyone ever moved any of his furniture (no one has). The house features 
beautiful period rooms with collections of 17th- and 18th-century furni-
ture, glass, clocks, and china. You can see the entire collection in about 
30 minutes. Stroll through the pretty walled garden (it’s free), even if 
you don’t visit the house. The tearoom downstairs is a good place for 
lunch or tea. Admission to the house is £5.90 ($9.75) adults, £3 ($4.95) 
children 5 to 15. The house is open mid-March through October 
Saturday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (Nov 1–11 until 3 p.m.); 
it’s closed December through mid-March.
 
 Almost 5km (3 miles) of medieval city walls enclose York, and walking 
along them is one of the best ways to enjoy the historic ambience of this 
ancient city. Fortified gateways (or bars) still serve as entrances to the old 
part of town. A path (daily 8 a.m. to dusk) runs along the top of the walls, 
with plenty of great views along the way. You find stairways up to the top 
of the walls at the four gates. Micklegate, the southern entry used by 
royalty, is a good place to start your wall walk.
Until 150 years ago, The Shambles was a street where butchers displayed 
their finest cuts in open windows on wide shelves called shammels. 
Today, this narrow, winding lane, with buildings so close that they shut 
out the light, is England’s most famous medieval street. Gift shops have 
replaced the butcher shops, so you can get in a bit of retail therapy as you 
stroll. No. 35 The Shambles is a shrine to St. Margaret Clitheroe, a butch-
er’s wife executed during the Reformation for hiding Catholic priests in 
her attic; she was canonized in 1970.
 If you want to revisit the Viking Age, hop into one of the time cars at Jorvik 
Viking Centre, Coppergate (% 01904/643-211; www.jorvik.co.uk), 
to be transported back to A.D. 948, when Eric Bloodaxe was king and York 
was Jorvik, a thriving Viking port and trading town. The scenes you 
see — of village life, market stalls, crowded houses, and the wharf — are 
meticulous re-creations based on archaeological finds in this area; even 
the heads and faces of the animatronic characters were modeled on Viking 
skulls. Artifacts unearthed on this site are also on display. Give yourself 
about 30 minutes. Admission is £8.50 ($14) adults, £7 ($12) seniors and 
students, £6 ($9.90) children 5 to 15. Jorvik is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. (until 4 p.m. in winter).
In the Medieval Era, guilds ran English towns. The 14th-century stone 
and half-timbered Merchant Adventurers Hall, Fossgate (% 0194/654-
818; www.theyorkcompany.co.uk), belonged to York’s most powerful 
guild (the Merchant Adventurers controlled trade into and out of the 
city). This building, one of the largest and best-preserved guildhalls in 
the country, has a great hall for business, a hospital for charitable work, 
and a chapel for worship. Allow 30 minutes for a tour with an audio 
guide. Admission is £3 ($4.95) adults, £2.50 ($4.15) seniors and students, 
£1 ($1.65) children 5 to 15. The guildhall is open April through September 
Monday through Thursday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Friday through Saturday 9 
a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Sunday noon to 4 p.m.; October through March Monday 
through Saturday 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

The great exhibits at the National Railway Museum, Leeman Road
(% 08448/153-139; www.nrm.org.uk), appeal to adults and children 
alike. The earliest train cars on display in this museum devoted to 
England’s railroad system date from the 1840s and look like stagecoaches 
on tracks. You can peek into the windows of private royal coaches, from 
Queen Victoria’s of 1869, with its bulky furniture (the engineer had to stop 
when the queen wanted to move from one car to the next), to Queen 
Elizabeth II’s streamlined, functional carriage, used until 1977. You see a 
replica of the first steam locomotive (1830) and a display of the new 
Eurostar high-speed train. You need at least an hour for a thorough visit 
of this fascinating museum. On some trains, kids can climb up into the 
engineer’s area. Admission is free. The museum is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 
p.m.; it’s closed December 24 through 26.
 England’s most popular folk museum, the York Castle Museum 
(% 01904/653-611; www.yorkshiremuseum.org.uk) is located in the 
area called Eye of York, near Clifford’s Tower. Using a treasure-trove of now-
vanished everyday objects, the exhibitions re-create slices of life from past 
historical eras. The museum took over York’s 200-year-old prison buildings, 
with graffiti still on the walls of the dingy cells. You can walk down a recon-
struction of Kirkgate, a cobbled Victorian shopping street; see a Jacobean 
dining room; visit a moorland cottage and a gypsy caravan; call in at a 
Victorian police station and an Edwardian pub; and check out the Jane 
Austen Costume Collection’s fashion and fabrics. Kids love the giant doll-
houses. Allow at least an hour. Admission is £7.50 ($12) adults, £4 ($6.60) 
children 5 to 15, £17 ($28) families (2 adults, 1 child). It’s open daily 9:30 
a.m. to 5 p.m.; it’s closed January 2 and December 24 through 26.
The Yorkshire Museum, Museum Gardens (% 01904/551-800; www.
yorkshiremuseum.org.uk), is somewhat old-fashioned and heavy on 
the text panels, but if you start in the Roman section and walk through 
to the end, you get a sound presentation of Yorkshire’s history from two 
millennia ago through the 16th century. You can view elegant Roman 
jewelry, mosaics, and Anglo-Saxon silver. Viking treasures include swords 
and battleaxes. The Middleham Jewel, a 15th-century pendant decorated 
with a large sapphire, was found in 1985 in North Yorkshire. The museum 
lies in 10 acres of landscaped gardens amid the ruins of St. Mary’s Abbey, 
Ghostly legions
In 1953, apprentice heating engineer Harry Martindale was working in the basement of 
the Treasurer’s House when he heard what sounded like marching feet. As he watched 
in amazement, a battalion of ghostly Roman soldiers marched right through the cellar. 
As it turns out, the Treasurer’s House was built over the main Roman road. You can 
check out the haunted cellar of Treasurer’s House yourself on one of the daily cellar 
tours, which cost £2.40 ($3.95).

once the wealthiest abbey in the north. On the grounds, you can see a 
15th-century timber-framed building known as The Hospitium. Give this 
museum about an hour. Admission is £5 ($8.25) adults, £3.50 ($5.80) 
children 5 to 15, and £12 ($20) families (2 adults, 1 child). The museum 
is open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; it’s closed January 1 and December 25 
through 26.
The York Art Gallery, Exhibition Square (% 01904/687-687; www.
yorkshiremuseum.org.uk), with freshly refurbished galleries and a 
new cafe, is in an Italian Renaissance–style building completed in 1879. 
The collections on view span seven centuries of Western European paint-
ing and include pictures by Parmigianino, Bellotto, Lely, and Reynolds, 
and a small collection of 20th-century studio pottery. You can see the 
entire collection in less than an hour; if your time is limited, don’t make 
this a priority. Admission is free. The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m.; it’s closed January 1 and December 25 through 26.
Dining locally
 
 Founded in 1919, Betty’s, 6–8 St. Helen’s Sq. (% 01904/659-142; www.
bettys.co.uk), is a wonderfully old-fashioned Art Nouveau tearoom, 
patisserie, and restaurant. Sandwiches, salads, and a dozen or so hot 
dishes (both fish and meat) are available. Specialties include smoked 
salmon muffins, Yorkshire rarebit, locally made sausages, and haddock 
and prawns in white-wine cream sauce. The pastries, all made according 
to secret recipes, are superb. At the shop in front, you can buy specialties, 
such as Yorkshire fat rascals (warm scones with citrus peels, almonds, 
and cherries) and Eccles cakes (flaky pastry filled with currants). Main 
courses go for £6.50 to £10 ($11–$17); cream tea costs £8 to £16 ($13–$26). 
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted. The restaurant is 
open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
If you’re looking for atmosphere and good Modern British cooking, try The 
Blue Bicycle, 34 Fossgate (% 01904/673-990; www.thebluebicycle.
com), an appealing restaurant overlooking the canal-like Foss River. It 
has a brasserie-style menu with a few standard menu items, daily spe-
cials, and a grill for meat and fish dishes. The dinner menu usually fea-
tures several varieties of fish cooked various ways, plus chicken, beef, 
and a vegetarian offering. Main courses run from £15 to £22 ($25–$36). 
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted. The restaurant is 
open daily from noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. The Blue Bicycle also 
rents out six self-contained luxury rooms in the center of York for £165 
($272) per room per night.

 Chapter 14: Going beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 293
If you’re looking for simple pub grub, stop in at Harkers, St. Helen’s Square 
(% 01904/672-795), in the former Yorkshire Insurance Company building, 
dating from 1824. The menu features traditional dishes, such as chicken-
and-onion pie, fish and chips, ploughman’s lunch (bread, cheese, and a 
salad), and Cumberland sausages. The place can become something of a 
mob scene after work. Main courses cost £6 to £11 ($9.90–$18). Master
Card and Visa are accepted. Food is served daily noon to 7 p.m.; the pub 
is open Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday noon to 
10:30 p.m.
Spending the night
 
 The Bar Convent, 17 Blossom St. (% 01904/264-902; www.bar-
convent.org.uk), a hotel in a former convent building, is an inexpen-
sive, unusual, and convenient place to stay. The accommodations are in a 
Georgian building on the corner of Nunnery Lane and Blossom Street, a 
five-minute walk from the train station. The seven rooms, refurbished 
in 2005, are comfortable but nothing fancy; only one has a private 
Ghouls and ghosties galore: 
York’s ghost walks
If you’re spending the night in York, check out the city’s array of Ghost Walks. 
Apparently, plenty of supernatural activity takes place in York, which some claim is 
England’s most haunted city. Evening ghost walks, with entertaining commentary and 
sometimes a bit of spookery thrown in, are a regular year-round industry. You have 
several tours to choose from and you can buy your tickets on the spot. Tours cost £4 to 
£5 ($6.60–$8.25) adults; £2 to £3 ($3.30–$4.95) seniors, students, and children 5 to 15.
 ✓ The Ghost Hunt of York (% 01904/608-700; www.ghosthunt.co.uk): “Andy 
Dextrous,” ghost hunter, leads this fun, one-hour walk and performance. Walks 
leave nightly at 7:30 from The Shambles, York’s medieval street.
 ✓ The Ghost Trail (% 01904/633-276; www.ghosttrail.co.uk): You get more 
traditional ghost-storytelling on this walk, which leaves nightly at 7:30 from the front 
entrance of York Minster.
 ✓ Original Ghost Walk of York (% 01759/373-090; www.theoriginalghost
walkofyork.co.uk): This tour started in 1973 and features great storytelling 
that explores the area’s folklore, legend, and dreams. Walks leave nightly at 8 p.m. 
from The King’s Arms Pub, Ouse Bridge.

bathroom. The convent, which houses a neoclassical chapel and a 
museum, was founded in 1686 and was active as a school until 1985. The 
on-site cafe serves inexpensive meals. A double room with shared bath-
room costs £57 ($94); the double room with private bathroom costs £70 
($116). Rates include continental breakfast. The hotel accepts MasterCard 
and Visa.
 
 Created from classical Regency brick town houses, The Grange, 1 Clifton 
(% 01904/644-744; www.grangehotel.co.uk), is a small, elegant hotel 
close to the city walls and a few minutes’ walk from York Minster. The 36 
individually designed rooms use antique furniture and convey a comfort-
able English charm. Bathrooms are nicely done. The hotel offers room 
service and two good restaurants: The Ivy, serving classic French and 
Modern British cuisine, is considered one of the best restaurants in York; 
the Brasserie offers informal dining in the old brick vaulted cellars. A 
double room with English breakfast costs £125 to £220 ($206–$363). 
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.

In this part . . . 
L
ondon, for some people, is synonymous with the perform-
ing arts. Planning a night out here isn’t the problem — 
choosing among all the possibilities is where the diffi culty 
lies. So, in Chapter 15, I give you the scoop on London’s 
world-class performing-arts scene, tell you how to fi nd out 
what’s going on and how to get tickets, and provide informa-
tion on the main venues for theater, music — including opera 
and symphony concerts — and dance. The performing arts 
are only part of London’s pulsing nightlife, so, in Chapter 16, I 
introduce you to some of the many places where you can rub 
elbows with Londoners and have a pint or two — pubs, bars, 
clubs, discos, and jazz spots.

Performing Arts
In This Chapter
▶ Getting the inside scoop on London’s theater and performing-arts scene
▶ Going to the symphony, listening to chamber music, and hitting rock 
concerts
▶ Seeing opera and dance performances
▶ Finding out what’s on and getting tickets
L
ondon is a mecca of the performing arts, offering world-class the-
ater, several symphony orchestras, rock concerts, operas, modern 
dance, and classical ballets. In a city renowned for its theater scene, you 
can enjoy every kind of play or musical. Or take your pick from the city’s 
own Royal Opera, Royal Ballet, English National Opera, or London 
Symphony Orchestra. This chapter gives you the information that you 
need to plan a trip that includes the performing arts.
Getting the Inside Scoop
From a global perspective, London may hold the title of world performing-
arts capital, based on the number of offerings and the quality of the per-
formances. Of course, London didn’t attain this stature overnight. The 
city has been building its theatrical reputation since the Elizabethan Era, 
when Shakespeare, Marlowe, and others were staging their plays in a 
South Bank theater district. A strong musical tradition has been in place 
since the 18th century.
The performing-arts scene, in general, gives London a buzz for residents 
and visitors alike. Major British stars with international screen reputa-
tions regularly perform in the West End (in 2009, for instance, Jude Law 
played Hamlet, and Helen Mirren played Phèdre to sold-out houses). 
You can also expect to find a few American plays and musicals, because 
there’s heavy crossover between London and New York productions.
And here’s some more good news: Tickets are still cheaper in London 
than in New York (even more so now that the dollar is worth more 

Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife 
298
against the pound). In London theaters, you rarely pay more than £50 
($83) for the best seats in the house. The price is dramatically less for 
symphony concerts, too: £15 to £25 ($25–$41) for excellent seats at the 
Barbican or Royal Festival Hall, for example. The same goes for that pric-
iest of art forms, opera — you can get special day-of-performance seats 
for as little as £20 ($33).
 
 Plays and performances in London have varying curtain times. Evening 
performances may begin at 7:30 p.m., 8 p.m., or 8:30 p.m., and matinees at 
1:30 p.m., 2 p.m., or 2:30 p.m. Check your ticket to be certain, because if 
you’re late, you won’t be admitted until the second act or a suitable pause 
in the action occurs. If you come laden with packages, you can check them 
in the coatroom. Talking and noisily unwrapping pieces of candy during 
the performance will be frowned upon — especially if I’m in the 
audience.
Wondering what to wear to the theater? London theater audiences are, 
generally speaking, pretty well dressed. Although no hard and fast rules 
apply, if you arrive in a sweat suit and running shoes, you’ll be 
conspicuous. A “smart casual” approach is best.
Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
For the most comprehensive listings of London performances, buy a 
copy of the weekly magazine Time Out, available at London newsstands 
on Wednesdays. You can find details for all London shows, concerts, 
and other performances in the daily London newspapers: The Daily 
Telegraph, the Evening Standard, The Guardian, The Independent, and The 
Times. Another good source is the free booklet London Planner, available 
at the British & London Visitor Centre; see the Quick Concierge, at the 
end of this book, for contact info.
To find out the performance schedule for an entire season, check out 
the Web sites that I list for specific opera, symphony, and ballet groups 
throughout this chapter. Many venues let you book online.
The Web is one of the best places to search in advance for information 
on plays and performances currently running in London. You may find 
the following sites useful:

 Chapter 15: Applauding the Performing Arts 299
Getting tickets
If you are in London and decide that you want to see a show, you’ll prob-
ably be able to get a seat. Even if an announcement has been made that 
a show is sold out, you can often buy a ticket from the theater’s box office, 
most of which open at 10 a.m. Ticket cancellations occur, and last-minute 
house seats go on sale the day of the performance or an hour before. But 
this isn’t guaranteed, and if you have your heart set on seeing a specific 
show, it may be a good idea to book your seat beforehand through Keith 
Prowse or one of the theater booking agencies listed in the next section.
If you don’t have time to go to the box office and you have a major credit 
card handy, call the theater directly. Box office phone numbers are 
listed in the papers and in Time Out. Many London theaters accept tele-
phone credit card bookings at regular prices (plus a minimal fee of 
about £2/$3.30). They’ll hold your tickets at the box office, where you 
pick them up any time up to a half-hour before the curtain. By buying 
directly from the box office, you don’t have to pay the commission fee 
(up to 30 percent) that ticket agencies charge.
 
 Buying a ticket in the “stalls” doesn’t mean that you’ll be seated in the 
ladies’ powder room. It means that you may have one of the best seats in 
the house. Stalls is the British term for first-floor orchestra. Most of the 
West End theaters are fairly old, which means that they may have boxes 
for sale as well; these box seats are on the sides of the second or 
third tiers.
Using ticket agencies
Ticket agencies are used for commercial West End plays, musicals, and 
concerts, but not always for opera, ballet, or other performing arts. All 
over the West End, and particularly around Leicester Square, ticket 
agencies boldly advertise that they have tickets to the sold-out hit shows. 
Most of these places are legitimate, but their commission fees vary and 
you’re not always assured of getting a good seat for the money you pay.
If you choose to use the services of a ticket agency instead of booking 
directly with the box office (see the preceding section), I recommend 
that you call, stop in, or book online at one of the following trustworthy 
agencies:
 
✓ Albemarle of London, 74 Mortimer St., W1 (% 020/7637-9041; 
www.albemarle-london.com; Tube: Oxford Circus or Goodge 
Street), is a long-established agency, open Monday through Friday 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Albemarle main-
tains dedicated theater desks at several of London’s ritzier hotels, 
including the Savoy, The Park Lane Hotel, The Dorchester, and 
Claridge’s (see Chapter 9). Its commission fee of 25 percent on top 
of the ticket price is what you can expect to pay for just about any 
theater booking made through a hotel concierge.

Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife 
300
 
✓ Keith Prowse maintains a counter at the Britain & London Visitor 
Centre, 1 Lower Regent St., SW1 (% 020/7808-3871; www.keith
prowse.com; Tube: Piccadilly Circus). Besides theater seats, it 
sells tickets to London events, such as the Summer Opening of 
Buckingham Palace. The counter is open Monday through Friday 
10:15 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
You pay a variable commission on top of the ticket price. Better 
yet, call Keith Prowse (% 800/669-8687 in the U.S., or 0870/840-
1111 in the U.K.) and book your seat over the phone. This agency 
can secure the best seats at the best price to theater performances 
and other entertainment, and it has special rates for London 
theater that are only available by phone — not online.
Before you buy any ticket in person from any agency, the agent must tell 
you the face value of the tickets (you can ask to see them); before you 
sign the charge receipt, be sure to check the seat numbers and the 
agent’s booking fee, as well as the tickets’ face value. If you’re making a 
telephone booking, the agent must disclose the face value of the tickets, 
their locations, and whether you have a restricted view.
 
 Beware of unlicensed ticket agencies that charge far more than the face 
value of the ticket plus a very hefty commission fee. A commission fee 
should never be more than 30 percent of the regular ticket price. Reputable 
ticket agencies belong to the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (STAR) 
and always advertise this fact.
 
 The Society of London Theatres (% 020/7836-0971; www.solt.co.uk) 
operates the tkts half-price ticket booth in the clock tower building by the 
gardens in Leicester Square (Tube: Leicester Square). The booth has no 
telephone info line, so you have to show up in person to see what’s on sale 
that day. One of the notice boards at tkts lists available theater tickets for 
matinee performances (which may be on Wed, Thurs, Sat, or Sun); the 
other notice board lists tickets available for evening performances. The 
booth is open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday 
noon to 3 p.m. Tickets are sold the day of the performance only; you can 
pay with cash or by MasterCard or Visa. You pay exactly half the price, 
plus a nominal fee (usually about £3/$4.95). The most popular shows usu-
ally won’t be available, but you may luck out. Tickets for the English 
National Opera and other events are sometimes available as well. You may 
want to stop by, in any case, to pick up a free copy of The Official London 
Theatre Guide, which lists every show, with addresses and phone num-
bers, and includes a map of the West End theater district.
 
 Ticket agencies advertising half-price or reduced-price tickets are located 
around Leicester Square. Keep in mind that The Society of London 
Theatres operates the only official half-price ticket booth (tkts, in Leicester 
Square), and wave away those pesky scalpers who hang out in front of 
megahits. They may, indeed, be selling (for an astronomical price) a valid 
ticket. And by law, these touts, as they’re called, must disclose the face 
value of the ticket, so you know exactly what the markup is. But some of 

 Chapter 15: Applauding the Performing Arts 301
these people also forge tickets, which means that you’ll be out of cash and 
out of a show. The best advice: Don’t deal with them.
Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
London is famous for the scope and excellence of its theater scene, but 
this world capital offers visitors a wealth of possibilities for enjoying all 
the performing arts.
Theater
Plays and musicals are staged all over the city in approximately 100 the-
aters, but the commercial hits are centered in the West End theater 
district — also called Theatreland — concentrated in the area around 
Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden. The theaters at 
the Barbican, the Southbank Centre, and Shakespeare’s Globe (see the 
following section) also provide major theater venues. Just like New York, 
London is the home of many fringe venues (the equivalent of off- or off-
off-Broadway theaters).
London’s theater offerings always include new plays and musicals, long-
run favorites, and revivals of the classics, as well as Shakespeare. Some 
of the shows in the West End — such as Agatha Christie’s Mousetrap and 
Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Phantom of the Opera — have been running for 
years and show no sign of winding down. The newest long-running musi-
cals are Mary Poppins, Wicked, and Billy Elliot. In general, evening perfor-
mances are Monday through Saturday, and, depending on the show, 
matinees are on Wednesday or Thursday, and Saturday. Some shows 
have added Sunday performances, too. Matinees are a couple of pounds 
cheaper than evening performances.
 
 In London, theaters don’t hand out play programs free of charge to every 
patron. If you want a program, you must buy it. They usually cost £3 to £5 
($4.95–$8.25). Another London theater tradition: During the interval (inter-
mission), ushers stand in the theater and sell ice cream.
Major stages beyond the West End
I can’t list all the theaters in Theatreland, but I can highlight three stand-
out venues. They’re geographically outside London’s West End, but 
they’re still considered part of the West End theater community.
 
✓ The Old Vic, The Cut, Waterloo, SE1 (% 020/7928-7616; www.
oldvictheatre.com; Tube: Waterloo), on the South Bank near 
Waterloo Station, has long been known as “the actors’ theater.” 
Many of England’s greatest performers have played on its stage, 
including Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, and Judi Dench. The 
American actor Kevin Spacey is the artistic director and appears 
in some of the shows. Its adjunct theater, the Young Vic (% 020/
7928-6363; www.youngvic.org), hosts productions of the Royal 

Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife 
302
Shakespeare Company. The box office for both venues is open 
Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 
 
✓ Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, New Globe Walk, Bankside, SE1 
(% 020/7401-9919; www.shakespeares-globe.org; Tube: 
Cannon Street or London Bridge), is the newest addition to the South 
Bank theater scene. The Globe presents a May-through-early-
October season of the bard’s plays (and, now, contemporary works 
as well) in a reconstructed oak-and-thatch, open-air, Elizabethan 
theater. (Performances may be canceled because of rain.) You 
can stand — 700 £5 ($8.25) standing-room tickets are available for 
every performance — or sit on benches; any discomfort is worth 
the opportunity to see Shakespeare performed not far from the 
original theater and right beside the Thames. Check out the Web 
site for current performances.
 
 
✓ On the South Bank is the Royal National Theatre (% 020/7452-
3000; Tube: Waterloo; www.nationaltheatre.org.uk), which 
performs in three theaters — the Olivier (1,160 seats), Lyttelton 
(890 seats), and Cottesloe (a smaller theater-in-the-round). The 
Royal National performs Shakespeare, but it also offers revivals of 
big Broadway musicals and new plays. Tickets cost slightly less than 
at the commercial theaters on the other side of the river, generally 
£10 to £40 ($17–$66) for evening performances and £9 to £35 ($15–$58) 
for matinees. You can get unsold seats at even lower prices two 
hours before curtain. The facility also houses cafes, bars, and a good 
bookstore. The box office is open Monday through Saturday from 
9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. You can find all performances and an online 
booking form on its Web site.
The fringe
In many ways, fringe theater is London’s real theatrical heartbeat. The 
fringe, London’s equivalent to New York’s off- or off-off-Broadway, is now 
commonly called Off West End. (When my own play, Beardsley, was pro-
duced in London, it was on the fringe.) Groups performing on the fringe 
don’t have the big bucks to mount lavish West End productions.
With the overabundance of acting talent in London, the fringe is where 
you may see tomorrow’s stars acting today and next season’s hit in its 
original, bare-bones form. The plays performed on the fringe are some-
times controversial or experimental, but for true theater lovers, they can 
provide a stimulating alternative to the tradition and glamour of the 
West End.
The performance spaces for fringe productions are usually smaller than 
for West End shows (sometimes tiny, sometimes above a pub), and the 
ticket prices are usually much lower (rarely more than £12/$20). Fringe 
theaters and spaces adapted to fringe productions are scattered far and 
wide, so consult a London A–Z or Time Out to find out what’s on and call 
the theaters directly for directions on how to find them.

 Chapter 15: Applauding the Performing Arts 303
Outdoor theater
What could be more fun than watching a good play performed under the 
stars? The Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre, Inner Circle, Regent’s Park, 
NW1 (% 020/7486-2431; www.openairtheatre.org; Tube: Baker 
Street), located on the north side of Queen Mary’s Rose Garden, has a 
May-to-August season. This large venue offers theater seats but no roof, 
so rain may cancel the show. Ticket prices range from £10 to £35 
($17–$58); you can check out the program on the theater’s Web site. 
Shakespeare’s Globe (see the “Major stages beyond the West End” 
section, earlier in this chapter) is another venue that’s open to the heavens.
Opera
 
 Two major opera companies call London home. The Royal Opera enjoys 
international prestige, performs operas in the original languages, and 
boasts the most famous international singers. Its home is the Royal Opera 
House, Covent Garden, WC2E (% 020/7304-4000; www.royalopera.
org; Tube: Covent Garden), which recently reopened after a state-of-the-
art refurbishment that added two smaller venues — the Linbury Studio 
Theatre and the Glore Studio Theatre. Ticket prices for the grand opera 
run £10 to £150 ($17–$248); 200 tickets in all price ranges are always avail-
able on the day of performance, starting at 10 a.m. For a summary of 
the opera (and ballet) season, check the Web site. If you have your heart 
set on seeing an opera at the Royal Opera, book as far ahead as you 
possibly can — I’m talking weeks, not days. The season runs September 
through July.
 
 The English National Opera (usually referred to as the ENO) typically 
offers more inventive productions than the Royal Opera, and usually 
includes a classic musical or two in its season. All the operas are sung in 
English. It performs at the freshly refurbished London Coliseum, St. 
Martin’s Lane, WC2N (% 0870/145-0200; www.eno.org; Tube: Leicester 
Square). Seats sell for £10 to £85 ($17–$140). The opera season runs 
September through July. You can see the ENO program and book online 
by going to its Web site.
The following two venues also offer you the opportunity to see opera 
during your time in London:
 
✓ The D’Oyly Carte Opera Company (% 020/7793-7100; www.doyly
carte.org.uk): For nearly 150 years, this company has been per-
forming the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. Venues change, 
and the schedule is irregular; it’s best to check out the company’s 
Web site for current information.
 
✓ The Holland Park Theatre, Holland Park, W8 (% 0845/230-9769; 
www.operahollandpark.com; Tube: Holland Park): London’s 
most charming stage uses the ruins of a Jacobean mansion in 
Holland Park as a backdrop for a mid-June-to-August season of 
opera and ballet. Tickets run £10 to £50 ($17–$83). You can view 
the performance schedule and book tickets online.

Symphony
 
 London offers some of the world’s finest classical and chamber music. The 
home base for the London Symphony Orchestra (www.lso.co.uk) is 
the Barbican Hall at the Barbican Centre, Silk Street, EC2Y (% 020/7638-
8891; Tube: Barbican), the concert hall portion of a giant performing-arts 
complex in the City. They also perform at St. Luke’s, 16 Old St. (Tube: 
Old Street). Seats in these acoustically fabulous halls sell for £10 to £60 
($17–$99). At the Barbican you may also catch a performance by the 
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (www.rpo.co.uk), which plays concerts 
here and at the Royal Albert Hall, another all-purpose venue for classical 
music.
The Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Gore, SW7 (% 020/7589-8212; Tube: 
High Street Kensington), is an enormous, circular, domed concert hall 
that has been a landmark in South Kensington since 1871. The box office 
is open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; ticket prices vary by event.
Wigmore Hall, 36 Wigmore St., W1 (% 020/7935-2141; www.wigmore-
hall.org.uk; Tube: Bond Street), is a beautifully renovated, century-
old concert hall used for chamber music and solo concerts and recitals. 
You can find performance information on the Web site.
Concerts by candlelight
Evening candlelit concerts of baroque music are performed weekly (usu-
ally on Thurs–Sat nights) at 7:30 p.m. in the lovely church of St. Martin-
in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, W1 (% 020/7839-8362; www.stmartins-
in-the-fields.org; Tube: Charing Cross; see Chapter 11). Lunchtime 
concerts are usually held on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 1 p.m. 
Tickets are generally £15 to £25 ($25–$41).
Four orchestras, one hall
The biggest and most exciting cultural news in London is the reopening of the newly 
refurbished Royal Festival Hall, the major concert venue in the Southbank Centre 
(Tube: Waterloo). Royal Festival Hall, which first opened in 1951 as part of the Festival 
of Britain, is now home to four resident orchestras: the London Philharmonic, the 
Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta, and the Orchestra of the Age of 
Enlightenment. The Southbank Centre is also the home of Queen Elizabeth Hall, a 
smaller venue that offers chamber-music concerts and dance programs, and the 
Purcell Room, an intimate setting used for recitals. You can get tickets and information 
on all three venues at the box office (in the foyer of Queen Elizabeth Hall), open daily 10 
a.m. to 8 p.m., or online at www.sbc.org.uk; prices vary for each event. For credit 
card bookings, call % 0871/663-2500.

 Chapter 15: Applauding the Performing Arts 305
Music under the stars
Kenwood House, Hampstead Lane, NW3 (% 0870/890-0146; Tube: East 
Finchley), a picturesque lakeside estate on Hampstead Heath, is the set-
ting for Kenwood Lakeside Concerts, a series of outdoor concerts held 
at 7:30 p.m. on Saturdays in July and August. A free shuttle bus runs 
between the East Finchley Tube station and the concert bowl. From 
Central London, you need at least 20 minutes to get to the Tube stop and 
another 15 minutes for the ride on the shuttle bus. Tickets cost £15 to 
£20 ($25–$33). You can find more information online, under “Kenwood 
House,” at www.picnicconcerts.com.
Dance
The Royal Ballet performs at the Royal Opera House; the English 
National Ballet and other visiting companies perform at the London 
Coliseum (see the “Opera” section, earlier in this chapter, for details).
Sadler’s Wells, Rosebery Avenue, EC1R (% 020/7863-6000; Tube: 
Angel), in Islington, is well known for its contemporary dance, theater, 
and music productions and as a venue for solo performers. Sadler’s 
Wells also manages the Peacock Theatre, Portugal Street, WC2 
(% 020/7863-8222; Tube: Covent Garden), a home for dance in the West 
End, and the Lillian Baylis Theatre, Arlington Way, EC1 (% 020/7713-
6000; Tube: Farringdon), a smaller venue for dance and performance. 
Programs for all three theaters are listed on the Web at www.sadler
swells.com.
Summer Proms
From mid-July through mid-September, fans of classical and pops concerts attend the 
wildly popular concert series called the Proms. Featuring musicians from all over 
Europe, Proms concerts are held at the Royal Albert Hall (see the “Symphony” section, 
earlier in this chapter), where they began in 1895. For Proms concerts, all seats are 
removed from the orchestra and gallery levels. Reserved seats are available, but devotees 
stand for a close look at the orchestras.
Starting in July, you can book seats online or through the Royal Albert Hall box office at 
% 020/7589-8212. To get one of the 1,400 standing-room places (£6–£13/$9.90–$21), you 
have to queue up on the day of the performance (Door 12, 9 a.m.–9 p.m.). An additional 
500 Arena and Gallery seats are available for £5 ($8.25) at the door, one hour before the 
concert. You can check out the Proms schedule on the Web at www.bbc.co.uk/
proms.

Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife 
306
The Place Theatre, 17 Duke’s Rd., WC1 (% 020/7387-0161; www.the
place.org.uk; Tube: Euston), is the main venue for contemporary 
dance in the United Kingdom. Riverside Studios, Crisp Road, W6 (% 020/
8237-1111; www.riversidestudios.co.uk; Tube: Hammersmith), is 
an arts center that showcases theater, cinema, and dance.
Rock concerts
When the rock and pop stars play London, they need a huge arena to 
hold their shrieking fans. The two biggest venues are Wembley Stadium, 
Empire Way, Wembley HA9 (Tube: Wembley Park), and the Earls Court 
Exhibition Centre, Warwick Road, SW5 (Tube: Earl’s Court). Tickets for 
large-scale events in these venues are sold through ticket agencies.
Dining before or after the performance
Will you eat dinner before or after going to the theater? Many of the restaurants in the 
West End that I review in Chapter 10 serve pre-theater meals. These places are geared 
for the theater crowd, so they know your time is limited. Restaurants usually serve their 
pre-theater menus from 5:30 to 7 p.m. The restaurant limits your choices to a set menu, 
but you can be done with your meal and out of the restaurant by 7:30 p.m. or earlier. You 
find post-theater menus less often; they go into effect around 9:30 p.m. You can usually 
find a good value in pre- and post-theater fixed-price menus.
The following restaurants (all of which you can read more about in Chapter 10) are close 
to West End theaters and have pre-theater or post-theater menus:
 ✓ Joe Allen Restaurant: 13 Exeter St., Covent Garden, WC2; % 020/7836-0651; Tube: 
Covent Garden
 ✓ Rules: 35 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, WC2; % 020/7836-5314; Tube: Covent 
Garden
 ✓ Simpson’s-in-the-Strand: 100 The Strand (next to the Savoy hotel), WC2; % 020/
7836-9112; Tube: Charing Cross
Just be sure to book a table beforehand. If you’re dining outside the West End, allot 
extra time to order, eat, pay the bill, get your coats, and then hop on the Tube or hail a 
taxi to make the curtain.
If you’re not fussy about what you eat and you just want to keep your stomach from 
growling during the performance, fast food joints are plentiful in Leicester Square and 
Piccadilly Circus. And if you’re going farther afield — to the Barbican or Southbank 
Centre — you can ward off impending hunger pangs with a light meal or a sandwich at 
one of the cafes or restaurants on the premises.

 Chapter 15: Applauding the Performing Arts 307
A much smaller (by that I mean less than 70,000 seats) rock and pop 
venue is the Carling Academy Brixton, 211 Stockwell Rd., SW9 (% 020/
7771-3000; www.brixton-academy.co.uk; Tube: Brixton).
Another big-event hall is Shepherd’s Bush Empire, Shepherd’s Bush 
Green, W12 (% 020/7711-3000; www.shepherds-bush-empire.
co.uk; Tube: Shepherd’s Bush). And sometimes the old Royal Albert 
Hall (see the “Symphony” section, earlier in this chapter) rocks, too.

Chapter 16
London’s Best Pubs, 
Clubs, and Bars
In This Chapter
▶ Getting the lowdown on the London pubs
▶ Searching out your kind of music and dancing
▶ Getting a dose of British humor
▶ Unwinding over cocktails
▶ Staying up late: The real late-night spots
▶ Finding gay and lesbian nightclubs and bars
M
aybe your idea of a perfect evening is going to an elegant hotel 
bar for a cocktail or sitting back in a historic pub and quaffing a 
pint of ale. In this chapter, I help you find a fun and fitting nightspot. And 
if you need music to make you happy, this chapter can point you in the 
direction of your kind of beat. For locations, see the “London Pubs, 
Clubs, and Bars” map on p. 310.
Enjoying a Pint: London Pubs
A great way to experience real-life London is to do a pub crawl — that is, 
walk from pub to pub and sample the different brews. If you’re accus-
tomed to ordering one particular type of beer with a rather conventional 
name, you may be bowled over by the colorful names and vast assortment 
of British beers on tap in a pub. You can find Brakspears, Courage Best, 
Friary Meux, Ind Coope Burton, Old Speckled Hen, and Wadworths 6X, to 
name just a few. Although you can get a hard drink at both bars and 
pubs, when you’re in a pub you’re better off confining yourself to beer 
because pubs don’t generally carry all the ingredients necessary for a 
fancy cocktail. Of course, if you find just the right pub, you can order a 
pint, get comfortable, and even order a good meal (see Chapter 10 for 
restaurants that serve pub grub).

 Chapter 16: London’s Best Pubs, Clubs, and Bars 309
Opening hours are regulated by Parliament. You can count on most 
pubs being open Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and 
Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m. Last call is ten minutes before closing, 
signaled by a bell.
 
 A movement is afoot to abolish the strict pub hours throughout the United 
Kingdom. The laws restricting pub hours were passed during World War I 
so that munitions workers and others involved in the war effort couldn’t 
spend too much time drinking at their “local.” The change requires an Act 
of Parliament to deregulate pub hours, but the drinkers who want pubs to 
remain open till the wee hours have a great deal of public support. 
Unfortunately, pubs are closing in London and throughout the U.K. 
because of the new no-smoking regulations, economics (it’s cheaper to 
drink at home), and the society-wide breakdown of old traditions, such as 
meeting your friends and drinking in a local pub. A pub-less England? 
Unthinkable!
Remember: Never tip your bartender. Instead, you can offer to buy him 
or her a drink.
When you’re in the City, try these pubs:
 
✓ Black Friar, 174 Queen Victoria St., EC4 (% 020/7236-5474; Tube: 
Blackfriars), is an Edwardian wonder made of marble and bronze 
Art Nouveau. The interior features bas-reliefs of mad monks, a low-
vaulted mosaic ceiling, and seating carved out of gold marble 
recesses.
 
✓ Olde Mitre, Ely Court, Hatton Garden, EC1 (% 020/7405-4751; 
Tube: Chancery Lane), named after an inn built on this site in 1547, 
is a small pub with an eccentric assortment of customers.
When you’re in West London, check out these pubs:
 
✓ Cittie of Yorke, 22 High Holborn, WC1 (% 020/7242-7670; Tube: 
Holborn or Chancery Lane), has the longest bar in Britain and looks 
like a great medieval hall — an appropriate look because a pub has 
existed at this location since 1430.
 
 
✓ Churchill Arms, 119 Kensington Church St., W8 (% 020/7727-4242; 
Tube: Notting Hill Gate or High Street Kensington) is loaded with 
Churchill memorabilia. The pub hosts an entire week of celebration 
leading up to Sir Winston’s birthday on November 30. Visitors are 
often welcomed like regulars here, and you’ll find the overall 
ambience to be down-to-earth and homey.
 
✓ Ladbroke Arms, 54 Ladbroke Rd., W11 (% 020/7727-6648; Tube: 
Holland Park), strays a bit from a traditional pub environment with 
its jazz in the background and rotating art prints, but it makes for a 
pleasant stop and a good meal. The pub’s changing menu may 
include such items as chicken breast stuffed with avocado and 
garlic steak in pink peppercorn sauce.

✓ Seven Stars, 53 Carey St., WC2 (% 020/7242-8521; Tube: Holborn), 
is a tiny and modest pub with a collection of Toby mugs and law-
related art. You can find the pub at the back of the law courts, so a 
lot of barristers drink here — you can pick up some British legal 
jargon while having a pint.
For more information on pubs and British beer, see Chapter 2. If you want 
to try a truly historic pub, check out my suggestions in Chapter 19.
Focusing on the Music: The Best 
Jazz and Blues Clubs
Small, smoky jazz clubs are common in London. In Soho, Ronnie Scott’s, 
47 Frith St., W1 (% 020/7439-0747; www.ronniescotts.co.uk; Tube: 
Tottenham Court Road), has been London’s preeminent jazz club for 
years, with dependably high-caliber performances and some big-name 
stars. Bring a full wallet because you have to order food (meals or 
snacks) on top of the £20 to £75 ($33–$124) admission.
In Earl’s Court, the 606 Club, 90 Lots Rd., SW10 (% 020/7352-5953; 
www.606club.co.uk; Tube: Earl’s Court or Fulham Broadway), is a 
basement club where young British jazz musicians play. You have to 
order food if you want to drink; to pay the musicians, the establishment 
adds to your bill an additional charge of £8 to £12 ($13–$20). You can 
find good food and diverse music (Afro-Latin jazz to rap) at the Jazz 
Cafe, 5 Parkway, NW1 (% 0870/060-3777; www.jazzcafelive.com; 
Tube: Camden Town). Admission runs £15 to £20 ($25–$33).
In Soho, try the PizzaExpress Jazz Club, 10 Dean St., W1 (% 020/7439-
8722; www.pizzaexpresslive.co.uk; Tube: Tottenham Court Road). 
Big names from the American jazz scene regularly perform in this intimate 
venue, and you can enjoy pizza, too. The club is open daily 7:45 p.m. to 
midnight, and the admission is £15 to £20 ($25–$33). In Knightsbridge, you 
can hear mainstream jazz performed in the basement Jazz Room of 
Pizza on the Park, 11 Knightsbridge, SW1 (% 020/7235-5273; Tube: 
Hyde Park Corner). The club is open daily from 7:30 p.m., with sets at 
9:15 p.m. and 11:15 p.m.; admission is £16 to £25 ($26–$41). Neither 
club’s cover charge includes food.
London’s only authentic blues venue is the Ain’t Nothing But the Blues 
Bar, 20 Kingly St., W1 (% 020/7287-0514; www.aintnothinbut.co.uk;
Tube: Oxford Circus). The club features local acts and touring American 
bands. Expect long lines on weekends. Hours are Monday through 
Thursday 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., Friday and Saturday 6 p.m. to 3 a.m., and 
Sunday 7:30 p.m. to midnight. Free every night except Friday and 
Saturday after 8:30 p.m.; cover charge varies from £5 to £15 ($8.25–$25).

 Chapter 16: London’s Best Pubs, Clubs, and Bars 313
Laughing the Night Away: Comedy Clubs
The Comedy Store, 1A Oxendon St., off Piccadilly Circus, SW1 (% 0870/
060-2340 to reserve by phone; www.thecomedystore.co.uk; Tube: 
Piccadilly Circus), is London’s best showcase for established and rising 
comic talent. Visitors must be 18 or older. Doors open at 6:30 p.m., and 
shows start at 8 p.m.; cover charge is £13 to £18 ($21–$30). You can’t 
reserve seats, so arrive early to get a good spot. 
You can also sample standup, London-style, at the Comedy Cafe, 66 
Rivington St., EC2 (% 020/7739-5706; www.comedycafe.co.uk; Tube: 
Old Street). Doors open at 7 p.m., and shows start at 8:30 p.m.; the cover 
is £5 to £15 ($8.25–$25).
Cool Bars for Hot London Nights
Don your coolest big-city duds before hitting these hip and happening 
bars. Some of the places listed here also serve food:
 
✓ Buddha Bar, 8 Victoria Embankment, WC2 (% 020/3371-7777; 
Tube: Embankment), which began as a top Paris nightspot, has 
opened a London branch; it’s about funky music, high-style décor, 
and Asian cuisine, if you’re hungry.
 
✓ Eclipse, 111–113 Walton St., SW3 (% 020/7581-0123; Tube: South 
Kensington), is a sophisticated bar with understated, elegant décor 
and a great place to sip a well-mixed martini or whisky sour and 
party the night away with the jet set.
 
✓ Electric Birdcage, 11 Haymarket, SW1 (% 020/7839-2424; Tube: 
Piccadilly Circus), is a reasonably priced dim sum palace with a 
cool, quirkily decorated bar and fab cocktails.
 
✓ At Hush, 8 Lancashire Court, Brook St., W1 (% 020/7659-1500; 
Tube: Bond Street), you can enjoy cocktails in the elegant Lounge, 
sip wine downstairs in La Cave, or dine on the charming terrace.
 
✓ Jewel, 4–6 Glasshouse Place, W1 (% 020/7439-4990; Tube: 
Piccadilly Circus), opened by Jennifer Lopez, attracts celeb party-
animals who love its chic, has-to-be-seen-to-be-believed interior.
Shaking Your Groove Thing: 
The Best Dance Clubs
London is a large, multicultural city, and its music scene reflects its 
diversity. In the London clubs, you can listen to drum ’n’ bass, indie, 
Asian underground (or tabla ’n’ bass, as it’s called), chemical beats 
(don’t ask), break beats, techno, trance, psychedelic, and many others. 

Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife 
314
In this volatile, late-night scene, new clubs are opening all the time and 
old ones are reinventing themselves.
Cover charges vary according to the day of the week and what band is 
playing. For more options, check out the music and club listings in Time 
Out, a weekly entertainment magazine.
 
✓ The Complex, 1–5 Parkfield St., N1 (% 020/7288-1986; Tube: 
Angel), in Islington, frequently books live bands. The club has four 
floors with different dance vibes on each. Hours are Friday and 
Saturday 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.; admission is £10 to £12 ($17–$20).
 
✓ The Equinox, Leicester Square, WC2 (% 020/7437-1446; Tube: 
Leicester Square), boasts London’s largest dance floor and one 
of the largest lighting rigs in Europe. A diverse crowd dances to 
equally diverse music, including dance hall, pop, rock, and Latin. 
The hours are Monday through Saturday 9 p.m. to 3 a.m., and the 
cover is £7 to £15 ($12–$25).
 
✓ Venom Club/The Zoo Bar, 13–17 Bear St., WC2 (% 020/7839-4188; 
Tube: Leicester Square), features a trendy Euro-androgynous crowd 
and music so loud that you have to use sign language. The club 
boasts the slickest, flashiest, most psychedelic décor in London, 
and even 35-year-olds come here. The hours are daily 9 p.m. to 
3 a.m., and the cover (charged only after 10 p.m.) is £5 to £10 
($8.25–$17).
 
✓ 36, 36 Shaftesbury Ave., W1 (% 020/7287-2715; Tube: Piccadilly 
Circus), formerly Bar Rumba, features rock ’n’ roll, funk, hip hop, 
drum ’n’ bass, soul, R&B, and swing. Hours are Monday through 
Thursday 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., Friday 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., Saturday 9 p.m. 
to 6 a.m., and Sunday 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. The cover is £5 to £15 
($8.25–$25).
 
✓ The Hanover Grand, 6 Hanover St., W1 (% 020/7499-7977; Tube: 
Oxford Circus), is funky and down and dirty on Thursday, but other-
wise, it’s cutting edge and always crowded. Age and gender are not 
always easy to distinguish here. Hours are Monday through Saturday 
10 p.m. to 4 a.m., and the cover is £10 to £15 ($17–$25).
 
✓ Housed in a former theater, Koko, 1A Camden High St., NW1 (no 
phone; www.koko.uk.com; Tube: Camden Town), draws a young 
all-night crowd addicted to trendy, downtown costumes. The music 
varies from night to night, so check online in advance. The club 
is open Tuesday and Wednesday 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., Friday 10 p.m. 
to 6 a.m., and Saturday 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. The cover is £5 ($8.25) 
Tuesday and Wednesday, £7 to £20 ($12–$33) Friday and Saturday.

Unwinding in Elegance: Posh Hotel Bars
Maybe you just want a quiet, romantic spot where you and your signifi-
cant other can enjoy a cocktail and actually talk to one another. Or 
perhaps you’re looking for a sophisticated place to enjoy a pre- or 
post-theater drink. The following establishments are just the ticket. 
They’re located in grand hotels and offer a bit of privacy from the 
crowds. A “smart casual” dress code is in effect at these establishments, 
so leave your jeans and sneakers in the hotel room.
The Palm Court, in The Park Lane Hotel, 12 Piccadilly, W1 (% 020/7499-
6321; Tube: Green Park or Hyde Park), is chic and nostalgic, with a plush 
décor, comfortable sofas, and soft lighting.
Looking for high ceilings, leather chesterfields, oil paintings, grand win-
dows, and old-world charm? Visit the Library Bar, in The Lanesborough, 
1 Lanesborough Place, SW1 (% 020/7259-5599; Tube: Hyde Park Corner), 
one of London’s poshest drinking retreats, known for its collection of 
ancient cognacs.
 
 At the Langtry Bar, in the Cadogan Hotel, Sloane Street, SW1 (% 020/7235-
7141; Tube: Sloane Square or Knightsbridge), you can go back in time to 
the charm and elegance of the Edwardian Era, when Lillie Langtry, an 
actress and a society beauty (and a mistress of Edward VII), lived at 
the Cadogan (see Chapter 9 for a description of the hotel). Writer Oscar 
Wilde — often a guest in Lillie’s home and in this hotel — is honored on 
the drinks menu by his favorite libation, the Hock and Seltzer.

Except for the die-hards in the all-night discos, Londoners retire to bed 
fairly early. Restaurants and bars routinely close before midnight. But a 
few places in restless, nightclub-heavy Soho stay open late to accommo-
date night owls (you can see these places on the “London Pubs, Clubs, 
and Bars” map on p. 310):
 
✓ Atlantic Bar & Grill, 20 Glasshouse St., W1 (% 020/7734-4888; 
Tube: Piccadilly Circus), is open for drinks Monday through 
Saturday until 3 a.m. You may have to wait in line for a place to sit.
 
✓ Bar Italia, 22 Frith St., W1 (% 020/7437-4520; Tube: Tottenham 
Court Road), is open 24 hours for coffee and serves a limited snack 
menu.
 
✓ Café Boheme, 13–17 Old Compton St., W1 (% 020/7734-0623; 
Tube: Tottenham Court Road or Leicester Square), offers a chance 
to get a drink Monday through Wednesday until 3 a.m., Sunday 
until 11:30 p.m., and Thursday through Saturday 24 hours.

Stepping Out: Gay Clubs and Discos
Check the gay listings in Time Out for nightclubs that have dedicated 
gay nights. Gay bars and pubs frequently have fliers for reduced-price 
admission to big dance venues like G.A.Y.
To be where it’s happenin’, stroll along Old Compton Street in Soho (Tube: 
Leicester Square). You may want to duck into Admiral Duncan’s, 54 Old 
Compton St., W1 (% 020/7437-5300), or the two-floor Compton’s of Soho, 
53–55 Old Compton St., W1 (% 020/7479-7961; www.comptons-of-
soho.co.uk). Both of these gay bars/pubs are Soho institutions, open 
Monday through Saturday noon to 11 p.m. and Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m.
For years, the city’s largest (and only) women-only bar was The Glass 
Bar (www.theglassbar.org.uk) on Euston Road. In 2009, the bar 
closed and, as of press time, it was going to reopen at a new location 
in Covent Garden but didn’t know where or when. For up-to-date 
information, check the Web site.
In terms of size, central location, and continued popularity, the best gay 
(and everyone else) disco in London is Heaven, Under the Arches, Craven 
Street, WC2 (% 020/7930-2020; www.heaven-london.com; Tube: Charing
Cross or Embankment). The place is open Monday and Wednesday 
10:30 p.m. to 3 a.m., Friday 10:30 p.m. to 6 a.m., and Saturday 10:30 p.m. 
to 5 a.m. Admission varies from £3 to £10 ($4.95–$17).
G.A.Y., London Astoria, 157 Charing Cross Rd., Soho, WC2 (% 0906/
100-016; Tube: Tottenham Court Road), is the biggest gay dance venue 
in Europe. Hours are Saturday 10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m., and admission is £10 
($17).

his part contains plenty of suggestions for having more 
fun and delving deeper into the fascinating city of 
London. You can have a wonderful time in London without 
reading a word of this part, or you can use this part to 
enhance your trip. If you’ve been to London once or twice 
already and you’re ready to expand your explorations, turn to 
these chapters for a few super ideas.
In Chapter 17, I describe ten historic London churches. In 
Chapter 18, you get the goods on ten extra-special London 
pubs. And in Chapter 19, I introduce you to ten notable royals.

Noteworthy London 
Churches

▶ Visiting historic churches
▶ Appreciating the architecture of Sir Christopher Wren
▶ Finding the Dickens link
▶ Checking out a Roman ruin
W
estminster Abbey and St. Paul’s Cathedral (both of which you 
can read about in Chapter 11) are giant repositories of English 
history and get the lion’s share of visitor attention in London. But the 
city boasts scores of smaller churches also worth visiting. The area 
known as the City of London is especially rich in neoclassical churches 
designed by Sir Christopher Wren (1632–1723) after the disastrous Great 
Fire of 1666. One of England’s greatest architects, and certainly its most 
prolific, Wren designed St. Paul’s.
This chapter explores ten London churches that you may want to check 
out on your ramblings around town. (For their locations, see the “More 
London Sights” map in Chapter 11.)
Church of St. Bartholomew the Great
On the east side of Smithfield Square, EC1 (Tube: Barbican), you can see 
a rare 16th-century gatehouse, and perched atop the gatehouse sits an 
even rarer late 16th-century timber-frame house predating the Great 
Fire. The gatehouse opens onto the grounds of the Church of St. 
Bartholomew the Great, a little-visited gem that just happens to be the 
oldest parish church in London. The church was part of an Augustinian 
priory founded in 1123. Over the centuries, the building has somewhat 
miraculously escaped major damage — despite being used at various 

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
320
times as stables and a printing office (where Benjamin Franklin worked 
in 1725). The 15th-century cloisters are to your right as you enter. Inside 
the church is a “weeping” 17th-century statue of Edward Cooke (the marble 
condenses moisture from the air); the tomb of Rahere, the priory’s 
founder; and a lovely oriel (projecting bay) window.
If you leave the churchyard by using the gate in the far-right corner, you 
come out on Cloth Fair, a street with gabled houses from 1604. Like St. 
Bartholomew’s, they’re among the very few surviving buildings predat-
ing the disastrous Great Fire that leveled much of London in 1666.
Church of St. Stephen Walbrook
Walbrook, EC4 (Tube: Cannon Street), a lane in the heart of the City, was 
the site of a brook that was paved over in medieval times. Today, the 
lane houses the Church of St. Stephen Walbrook, one of Sir Christopher 
Wren’s finest works. By the 18th century, the fame of this church had 
spread throughout Europe, and many still consider it the most beautiful 
church in London. Its splendid dome served as a model for the one at St. 
Paul’s Cathedral. The travertine altar beneath the dome was sculpted in 
1956 by British sculptor Henry Moore, who had reservations about 
tackling the job because he was an agnostic. “Henry, I’m not asking you 
to take the service,” said the rector who offered Moore the commission. 
“I understand that you’re a bit of a chiseler; just do your job.”
St. Botolph’s
I think it’s appropriate to include in this chapter a church dedicated to 
England’s patron saint of travelers: St. Botolph’s on Aldersgate Street, 
EC1 (Tube: Barbican), close to the Museum of London (see Chapter 11). 
The church interior has a fine barrel-vaulted roof. Actually, three city 
churches are dedicated to St. Botolph, and all are located beside now-
vanished gates into the city. At one time, instead of being greeted by 
ATMs and currency-exchange windows, travelers could pause and give 
thanks to Botolph for their safe journey to London.
St. Dunstan’s-in-the-West
The octagonal St. Dunstan’s-in-the-West, on Fleet Street, EC4 (Tube: 
Temple), is a fine early example of Gothic Revival architecture. That style 
was in fashion when an earlier church that survived the Great Fire of 1666 
was replaced between 1829 and 1833. The large clock on the tower is 
something of a historical curiosity: The clock dates from 1671 and was 
installed by the congregation as an offering of thanks because the church 
hadn’t burned down. Every 15 minutes, two giant clubs strike a bell that 
has been tolling for more than 330 years. People take clocks, watches, and 

 Chapter 17: Making Amens: Ten Noteworthy London Churches 321
timepieces for granted nowadays, but this clock was the first in London 
to have a double face and to have minutes marked on the dial.
St. George the Martyr Church
In Southwark, next to the remains of Marshalsea Prison on Borough High 
Street, SE1 (Tube: Borough), you can find St. George the Martyr Church. 
The church is probably more famous for its literary associations than 
for any beauty of the structure itself. This church is where Dickens’s fic-
tional heroine Little Dorrit is baptized and, at one point, is forced to 
spend the night when she’s locked out of the Marshalsea debtors’ 
prison; later she’s married in this church. A stained-glass window in the 
east wall shows her at prayer.
St. Margaret’s Westminster
St. Margaret’s Westminster, the parish church of the House of Commons 
since 1614, is on St. Margaret Street, SW1 (Tube: Westminster), and is 
often mistaken for Westminster Abbey next door. St. Margaret’s is notable 
for its glorious above-the-altar East Window, the stained glass of which 
was presented by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain to com-
memorate the marriage of their daughter, Catherine of Aragon, to Arthur, 
the son of Henry VII. By the time the glass arrived, Arthur had died and 
Henry VIII, his younger brother, had wed Catherine, the first of his eight 
wives. (He divorced her to marry Anne Boleyn.) The weddings of poet 
John Milton (1656) and statesman (and future prime minister) Winston 
Churchill (1908) were held in this church.
St. Martin-in-the-Fields
St. Martin-in-the-Fields, on Trafalgar Square, WC2 (Tube: Charing Cross), 
was a stylistic prototype for hundreds of churches constructed in 18th-
century New England. James Gibbs, who was influenced by the churches 
of Sir Christopher Wren, designed the church in 1726. Furniture designer 
Thomas Chippendale, painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and William Hogarth, 
and Nell Gwynn, mistress of Charles II, are buried within. For details 
about the concerts held here, see the description of St. Martin in 
Chapter 11.
St. Mary-le-Bow
Established in the 11th century, St. Mary-le-Bow, on Bow Lane, EC4 (Tube: 
Mansion House), is one of London’s most venerable churches. The struc-
ture that originally stood here was a casualty of the Great Fire of 1666; the 
steepled church that you see today is a work by Sir Christopher Wren, who 

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
322
modeled it after Rome’s Church of the Basilica of Maxentius. According to 
tradition, a true Cockney (a native of the East End of London) is someone 
born within hearing distance of the bells of St. Mary-le-Bow. In the church-
yard’s garden is a statue of Captain John Smith, a one-time parishioner 
who left London to become one of the first settlers of Jamestown, Virginia. 
(He’s the one who was saved by Pocahontas.)
Southwark Cathedral
Southwark Cathedral, on Montague Close, SE1 (Tube: London Bridge), 
is one of the oldest buildings in Southwark and also one of the most 
beautiful (see Chapter 11). A church has occupied this site for at least a 
thousand years; before that, a Roman villa stood here.
London’s second-oldest church, after Westminster Abbey, Southwark 
Cathedral, in the 12th century, was the first Gothic church to be erected 
in London. Today, you can see the 15th-century cathedral (with Victorian 
restorations) that once served London’s rowdy South Bank theater dis-
trict. Chaucer and Shakespeare both worshiped here, and Shakespeare’s 
brother Edmund was buried here in 1607.
Besides a memorial to the immortal bard, the church contains a 13th-
century wooden effigy of a knight, one of the oldest surviving wooden 
effigies in England. John Harvard, founder of Harvard University, was 
baptized in this church.
Temple of Mithras
Not far from St. Stephen Walbrook (see “Church of St. Stephen Walbrook,” 
earlier in this chapter), at the entrance to Temple Court on Queen Victoria 
Street (Tube: Mansion House), you can find the remains of what’s proba-
bly London’s oldest church site. This church isn’t a Christian church, 
however, but a 3rd-century Roman temple. Unearthed during 1954 excava-
tions and raised to its present level, the Temple of Mithras is shaped like 
a tiny Christian basilica with a central nave and two aisles.
The Mithraic cult, which had its origins in Persia and was brought to 
London by Roman soldiers in the 2nd century, used this temple. At one 
time, when the Roman Empire still ruled the Western world, Mithraism 
was as popular as Christianity. Archaeologists speculate that the pagan 
temple was destroyed in the 4th century, when Christianity became the 
official religion of the empire. Some of the sculptures that were found in 
the temple are displayed in the Museum of London (see Chapter 11).

Chapter 18
Ale’s Well That Ends Well: 
Ten Historic London Pubs
In This Chapter
▶ Enjoying some pub history
▶ Finding a pub with character
P
ublic houses, better known as pubs, have been a way of life in London 
and throughout the United Kingdom for centuries. Chapters 2, 10, 
and 16 offer information about London pubs. But I could write an entire 
book just on the pubs of London — the city has hundreds of them. Not 
all these pubs are old, of course, and not all have the kind of character 
that accumulates over centuries of drinking, talking, smoking, and eating. 
But dozens upon dozens of these pubs date back anywhere from a 
century to more than 400 years.
This chapter offers descriptions of ten more pubs. Each of these places 
has some special story, history, or association attached to it. (For their 
locations, see the “London Pubs, Clubs, and Bars” map in Chapter 16.) 
All these pubs are open regular pub hours (Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–11:30 p.m.); 
some are open Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m. And, as of 2007, smoking is no 
longer permitted in any of them.
The Anchor
Eighteenth-century figures, such as Samuel Johnson, who produced the 
first Dictionary of the English Language, playwright Oliver Goldsmith, 
whose most famous work is She Stoops to Conquer, and painter Sir 
Joshua Reynolds, the first president of the Royal Academy, frequented 
The Anchor, 34 Park Street, SE1 (% 020/7407-1577; Tube: Southwark). 
It has a nice riverside terrace.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
324
The Coal Hole
Opened in the early 19th century, The Coal Hole, 91 The Strand, WC2 
(% 020/7379-9883; Tube: Covent Garden), got its name from the coal 
haulers who unloaded their cargo on the Thames nearby. One of Central 
London’s larger pubs, the Coal Hole has many theatrical connections 
because of its West End location. Famous mid-19th-century Shakespearean 
actor Edmund Kean used to hire rowdies, get them drunk here, and then 
send them off to heckle his rivals in other theaters.
George Inn
You can find one of the city’s most historically important pubs in the 
George Inn, in The George Inn Yard off Borough High Street, SE1 (% 020/
7407-2056; Tube: Borough). It’s the last remaining example in London of 
an old-style coaching inn, with balconies (called galleries) around the 
inner court. The George was doing business during the reign of Henry 
VIII, and some claim it actually dates back to Chaucer’s era.
The King’s Head & Eight Bells
Chelsea’s intimate, clublike King’s Head & Eight Bells, 50 Cheyne Walk, 
SW3 (% 020/7352-1820; Tube: Sloane Square), opened more than 400 
years ago, around 1580. Back then, of course, the area was rural; Henry 
VIII’s country house stood nearby. Later, celebrated artists and writers, 
such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Thomas Carlyle (whose house is now a 
museum; see Chapter 11), Oscar Wilde, Laurence Olivier, and Vivien 
Leigh made their homes in Chelsea, one of the prettiest (and now one of 
the most expensive) parts of London. The neighborhood is still filled 
with literary and other luminaries, so keep your eyes open if you stop in 
here — you never know who may pop in.
Lamb & Flag
The Lamb & Flag, 33 Rose St., WC2 (% 020/7497-9504; Tube: Leicester 
Square), was once known by the grisly name “Bucket of Blood” because 
prizefighters battered one another into a bloody pulp during matches held 
for betting customers. The pub, a rare survivor of the Great Fire of 1666, 
has a couple of literary associations to offset its unsavory past. In the 19th 
century, this place was one of Charles Dickens’s favorite taverns. A couple 
of centuries earlier, poet John Dryden was attacked and beaten just 
outside, probably because of a lampoon that he directed at the earl of 
Rochester. Every year on December 16, the pub commemorates the 
anniversary of the attack with a Dryden Night.

 Chapter 18: Ale’s Well That Ends Well: Ten Historic London Pubs 325
Red Lion Public House
Civil servants and members of Parliament (MPs) frequent the Red 
Lion Public House, 48 Parliament St., SW1 (% 020/7930-5826; Tube: 
Westminster). So many MPs stop in here that the pub rings a special bell 
before a vote is taken, allowing the lawmakers to get back in time. Charles 
Dickens stopped in once for a pint of beer — he was 11 years old at the 
time. (Life was different back then.)
Salisbury
I’m partial to the Salisbury, 90 St. Martin’s Lane, WC2 (% 020/7836-5863; 
Tube: Leicester Square), because I used to hang out there. The pub sits 
right in the heart of the West End theater district, dates from 1852, and 
has a beautifully preserved Art Nouveau interior with marble fittings, cut-
glass mirrors, and brass statuettes. Like the Lamb & Flag noted earlier, the 
Salisbury was once famous for bare-knuckle prizefights — but that was 
long before my time.
Williamson’s Tavern
Williamson’s Tavern, in Groveland Court, off Bow Lane, EC4 (% 020/
7248-6280; Tube: St. Paul’s), was the residence of the lord mayor of the 
City of London before the nearby Mansion House was built. The tavern 
stands behind a 17th-century gate presented to the lord mayor by 
William and Mary. The building later served as an inn. Inside, you can 
have a drink and one of its famous steak sandwiches.
Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese
Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, Wine Office Court, 145 Fleet St., EC4 (% 020/
7353-6170; Tube: Blackfriars), was established in 1667, but a tavern stood 
on this site as early as 1590 (see Chapter 11). The earlier tavern burned 
down in the Great Fire of 1666 and was quickly rebuilt — in fact, Ye Old 
Cheshire Cheese was the first pub to reopen after the fire. Downstairs, 
you can see charred wooden beams bearing witness to the massive fire 
that destroyed a large portion of London. This pub was one of Charles 
Dickens’s favorite hangouts, and he usually sat at a table to the right of 
the fireplace on the first floor.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
326
Ye Olde Watling
Ye Olde Watling, 29 Watling St., EC4 (% 020/7653-6252; Tube: Mansion 
House), is a 17th-century pub that the great architect Sir Christopher 
Wren used as an office when St. Paul’s Cathedral was being constructed. 
The pub was built from timber taken from dismantled sailing ships.

Chapter 19
Ten Important Royals — 
Past and Present
In This Chapter
▶ Meeting a few notable royals
▶ Noting changes in rulers and ruling over two millennia
I
 am not a royalist, but the kings and queens of England fascinate me. 
These are people whose lives encapsulated ultimate power and 
humiliating defeat, people who killed to stay on the throne and were 
killed by others who wanted it, people who inspired their subjects and 
some that treated them like dirt, people who sometimes changed the 
course of history and sometimes disgraced the nation they ruled.
I had a hard time choosing just ten, but in the thumbnail sketches that 
follow, you can get at least a glimpse of how the rulers of England — and 
the rule of England — have changed over the past 2,000 years.
Queen Boudicca (A.D. 30?– A.D. 60): 
Braveheart of the Britons
I’ve always thought Boudicca’s story would make a fantastic film, but 
who would play this fierce Celtic queen who painted her face blue and 
led 100,000 British troops against the invading Romans in A.D. 60? 
Angelina Jolie?
Boudicca’s story harks back to the earliest period of Britain’s recorded 
history. Historians think that she was born about A.D. 30. In A.D. 48, she 
married Prasutagus, king of the Iceni, and bore him two daughters. The 
Iceni were a Celtic tribe that had been made a Roman client-state in A.D. 43. 
When Prasutagus died, he left his kingdom — as required by Roman law — 

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
328
to the Roman emperor. But hoping to provide for his two daughters, he 
left a portion of his personal estate to them. For the Romans, that inheri-
tance gave them a perfect excuse to confiscate all of Prasutagus’s belong-
ings and punish the Iceni for “disobeying” Roman law. Just days after her 
husband’s death, Boudicca was stripped and publicly whipped, her teen-
age daughters raped by Roman soldiers.
The outrages committed by the invading foreigners changed Boudicca’s 
life forever. As more Roman troops arrived to begin the job of conquer-
ing all the native Britons, Boudicca managed to raise an army among for-
merly warring local tribes. The Celts were much feared by the Romans 
because Celtic women fought alongside the men, painting their faces 
blue to frighten the enemy and uttering terrifying shrieks as they 
attacked with swords, axes, and clubs. Boudicca and her army marched 
to Roman forts and settlements, laid waste to them, and killed their 
inhabitants. Finally, at a site that was probably somewhere in the West 
Midlands, Boudicca faced the army of Suetonus Paulinus, the Roman 
governor of Britannia. She had more troops, but Suetonius and his 
legionnaires had the discipline that helped Rome conquer the Western 
world. The Celts under Boudicca were slaughtered. No one knows what 
happened to Boudicca herself. Some accounts say that she took poison. 
The alternative, had she lived, would have been worse. She would have 
been paraded in chains at a public triumph in Rome and then publicly 
tortured in the Coliseum.
Next time you’re crossing Westminster Bridge in London, look up and 
you can see a bronze statue of Boudicca on the north side. A mid-19th-
century work by Thomas Hornicraft, it shows a wild-haired superwoman 
in a horse-drawn chariot with her daughters.
Alfred the Great (849–899): 
A Warrior and a Scholar
If you make a trip to Winchester, the capital of the old Anglo-Saxon king-
dom of Wessex, you can see a statue of Alfred the Great on Bridge Street. 
Alfred is the only English monarch to carry the title “the Great,” and that 
alone makes him an intriguing character. His story goes back to the 9th 
century A.D., when the Danes, more commonly known as the Vikings, 
were relentlessly attacking and terrorizing England.
Youngest son of King Æthelwulf, Alfred became king of Wessex in 871. 
Wessex was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom patched together in southern and 
southwestern England after the departure of the Romans in A.D. 410. 
Following a series of attacks led by the Dane Guthorm, Alfred finally 
defeated the Danes decisively at the Battle of Eddington. As a condition 

 Chapter 19: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 329
of the peace treaty, Guthorm withdrew his forces from Wessex, and 
Alfred recognized Danish control over East Anglia and parts of Mercia. 
This partition of England was called the Danelaw, and though the English 
kings soon brought the Danelaw back under their rule, they didn’t attempt 
to interfere with the laws and customs of the area, many of which sur-
vived until after the Norman Conquest in 1066.
Alfred created a series of fortifications to surround his kingdom and pro-
vide security from invasion. (You can still find traces of burh, the Anglo-
Saxon word for these forts, in the common English place-name suffix –bury.) 
The reign of Alfred was known for more than military success, however. He 
promoted better education and helped make learning important in an age 
when education had gone into a decline because of Danish looting of mon-
asteries and churches, traditional centers of learning. Alfred was also a cod-
ifier of law and a patron of the arts. A warrior and a scholar, he translated 
Latin books into the Anglo-Saxon tongue. With the kind of leadership that 
he provided, it’s no wonder he was proclaimed “the Great.”
William the Conqueror (1028–1087): 
Winner Takes All
The illegitimate son of the Duke of Normandy, William received the duchy 
of Normandy upon his father’s death in 1035. He spent the next several 
years consolidating his strength on the Continent through marriage, 
diplomacy, war, and savage intimidation. By 1066, Normandy was in a 
position of virtual independence from William’s feudal lord, Henry I of 
France, and the disputed succession in England offered William an 
opportunity for invasion.
When Edward the Confessor died childless, the English crown was offered 
to Harold Godwinson (an Anglo-Saxon), even though Edward had pur-
portedly promised the throne to William, his second cousin. Insisting 
that Harold had sworn allegiance to him in 1064, William prepared for 
battle. But as the new King Harold anxiously awaited William’s arrival on 
England’s south shores, Harold Hardrada, the king of Norway, invaded 
England from the north. Harold’s forces marched north to defeat the 
Norse at Stamford Bridge on September 25, 1066. Two days after the 
battle, William landed unopposed at Pevensey, forcing Harold to move 
south to a new battleground. What has come to be known as the Battle 
of Hastings took place on October 14, 1066. Harold and his brothers died 
fighting, thus removing any further organized Anglo-Saxon resistance to 
the Normans. The Anglo-Saxon earls and bishops soon submitted and 
crowned him William I on Christmas Day in 1066.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
330
William’s acquisitive nature never left him. His forces ruthlessly crushed 
uprisings until, by 1072, the whole of England was conquered and 
united. William confiscated lands and reallocated them to the Normans. 
In 1085, William commissioned the Domesday Book to survey land own-
ership, assess property, and establish a tax base. Although he began his 
invasion with papal support, William refused to let the Church dictate 
policy within English and Norman borders. Ruthless and cruel, the 
Conqueror exacted a high toll from his subjects, but he also laid the 
foundation for the economic and political success of England. Buildings 
from his reign include Windsor Castle and the Tower of London (both of 
which you can read about in Chapter 11), but you can find perhaps the 
most atmospheric reminder of William the Conqueror in Battle, a town in 
Sussex, where you can visit the battlefield that was William’s first con-
quest in England.
Henry II (1133–1189): Family Plots
Henry II, the first Plantagenet king, was one of the most effective of England’s
monarchs, refining Norman government and creating a self-standing 
bureaucracy that could keep the country running even if it had a weak or 
incompetent monarch. But Henry’s personal life was one unending soap 
opera, with more plots and counterplots than I can possibly detail here.
A grandson of Henry I, Henry was raised in the French province of 
Anjou. His vast continental possessions more than doubled when he 
married Eleanor of Aquitane, the ex-wife of King Louis VII of France. 
Eleanor was 11 years older than Henry and was rumored to have slept 
with his father. Crowned King of England in October 1154, Henry was 
technically a feudal vassal of the king of France but, in reality, owned 
more territory and was more powerful than his French lord.
Throughout his reign, Henry instituted reforms meant to weaken tradi-
tional feudal ties and strengthen his position, but in the process of 
strengthening the royal courts, he became involved in the murder of his 
best friend, Thomas Beckett. The church courts instituted by William 
the Conqueror had become a safe haven for criminals, and Henry wanted 
to transfer sentencing in such cases to the royal courts. Thomas Beckett, 
named archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, vehemently opposed the weaken-
ing of church courts. He also angered Henry by opposing the coronation of 
Henry’s eldest son. When an exasperated Henry publicly conveyed his 
desire to be rid of the contentious archbishop, four thuggish knights took 
the king at his word and murdered Beckett in his own cathedral on 
December 29, 1170. (You can see the exact spot if you visit Canterbury 
Cathedral; see Chapter 14.)

 Chapter 19: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 331
Henry’s plans for dividing his myriad lands and titles evoked treachery 
from his sons, who, with the encouragement of their mother, repeatedly 
rebelled against their father. Eleanor, equally ruthless and scheming, 
was kept a virtual prisoner for 16 years. Henry died in 1189, two days 
after being attacked and defeated by his son Richard, with the assistance of 
Philip II Augustus of France, forcing Henry to accept a humiliating peace.
Henry VIII (1491–1547): 
Take My Wife — Please!
The significance of Henry’s reign is generally overshadowed by his six 
marriages, a record topped only by Elizabeth Taylor. Something is 
scarily pathological about Henry’s many marriages, even if they were in 
pursuit of an elusive male heir.
His first wife was Catherine of Aragon (widow of his brother, Arthur), 
whom he married in 1509 and divorced in 1533; the union produced one 
daughter, Mary. Henry married the pregnant Anne Boleyn in 1533; she 
gave him another daughter, Elizabeth, but was executed in 1536 on 
trumped-up charges of infidelity, a treasonous charge in the king’s con-
sort but never for the king. The same month that Anne was beheaded, 
the monarch married Jane Seymour, who died giving birth to Henry’s 
lone male heir, Edward, in October 1536. After viewing Hans Holbein’s 
beautiful portrait of the German princess Anne of Cleves, Henry arranged 
a marriage with her early in 1540. When Anne arrived, however, Henry 
found her so homely that he never consummated the marriage. In 1540, 
with Anne scratched off the list, he married Catherine Howard, who was 
executed for infidelity two years later and reputedly haunts Hampton 
Court Palace to this day. Catherine Parr became Henry’s sixth and last 
wife in 1543, and she provided for the needs of both Henry and his 
children until his death in 1547.
So what did Henry do besides bed and wed? Most notably, he altered 
England and the whole of Western Christendom by separating the Church 
of England from Roman Catholicism. The separation actually happened 
because of Henry’s obsession with producing a male heir. When Catherine 
of Aragon failed to produce a male, Henry sought an annulment from the 
pope in order to marry Anne Boleyn. When Cardinal Wolsey failed to 
secure a legal annulment, Henry summoned the Reformation Parliament, 
which passed 137 statutes in seven years, influencing political and eccle-
siastical affairs in a way previously unknown. By 1536, all ecclesiastic 
and government officials were required to publicly approve of the break 

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
332
with Rome and take an oath of loyalty. Henry’s dissolution of the monas-
teries filled royal coffers, as revenues from the sale of monastic lands 
went either to the Crown or to the nobility. The break with Rome, cou-
pled with an increase in governmental bureaucracy, led to the royal 
supremacy that lasted until the execution of Charles I and the establish-
ment of the Commonwealth a century after Henry’s death.
Elizabeth I (1533–1603): Heart 
and Stomach of a King
In contrast to her much-married father, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I never wed 
and was known as the Virgin Queen. When she ascended the throne 
in 1558, dissension between Catholics and Protestants tore at the very 
foundation of society, and the royal treasury had been bled dry by Mary, 
Elizabeth’s Catholic half-sister, and Mary’s advisors.
Instead of being a fanatic like Mary, Elizabeth was strong-willed, tolerant, 
and intelligent. In religious matters, she devised a compromise that basi-
cally reinstated her father’s Protestant reforms. Another potentially 
volatile problem was her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, who gained the 
loyalty of Catholic factions and instituted several plots to assassinate or 
overthrow Elizabeth. After irrefutable evidence of Mary’s involvement in 
such plots came to light, Elizabeth sadly succumbed to the pressure 
from her advisors and had the Scottish princess executed in 1587.
The persecution of continental Protestants forced Elizabeth into war, a 
situation which she desperately tried to avoid. She sent an army to aid 
French Huguenots (Calvinists who had settled in France) after a 1572 
massacre in which over 3,000 Huguenots lost their lives, and she 
assisted Belgium in its bid to gain independence from Spain. After 
Elizabeth rejected a marriage proposal from Philip II of Spain, the indig-
nant Spanish monarch, incensed by English piracy and forays in the New 
World, sent his much-feared Armada to raid England. “I know I have but 
the body of a weak and feeble woman,” Elizabeth told her troops, “but I 
have the heart and stomach of a king.” England won the naval battle and 
emerged as the world’s strongest naval power.
In many ways, Elizabeth’s reign has come to be regarded as a Golden Age. 
Literature bloomed through the works of Spenser, Marlowe, and 
Shakespeare. Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh expanded English influ-
ence in the New World. Elizabeth’s religious compromise laid many fears 
to rest and sought to avoid murderous strife. Fashion and education 
came to the fore because of Elizabeth’s penchant for knowledge, courtly 
behavior, and extravagant dress. Good Queen Bess, as she came to be 

 Chapter 19: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 333
called, maintained a regal air until the day she died, at 70 years of age 
and after a very successful 44-year reign. Few English monarchs enjoyed 
such political power while still maintaining the devotion of the whole of 
English society.
George III (1738–1820): “My Lords 
and Peacocks . . .”
George III was in no way an exemplary ruler, but I’ve long been fascinated 
by him because he was king at the time of the American Revolution and 
because he went mad. The only thing he really excelled at was procreation. 
He married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1761, and the prolific 
couple produced 15 children.
George was descended from the Hanoverian (German) line of succession 
that first came to the English throne in 1714. Determined to recover royal 
prerogatives lost to the Whig Party by George I and George II, George III 
methodically weakened the Whigs through bribery, coercion, and patron-
age, hand-picking yes-men of mediocre talent and servile minds to serve 
as cabinet members.
George’s commitment to taxing the American colonies to pay for military 
protection led to hostilities in 1775. The colonists proclaimed indepen-
dence in 1776, but George obstinately continued the war until the final 
American victory at Yorktown in 1781. The Treaty of Paris, signed in 1783, 
ensured British acknowledgment of the United States of America. Bouts 
with madness (attributed to a disease called porphyria) and the way he 
handled the American Revolution eroded his support.
Other major events and people marked George III’s reign. The British 
Army under the Duke of Wellington (whose London residence, Apsley 
House, you can visit; see Chapter 11) and the British Navy under Lord 
Horatio Nelson (honored by Nelson’s Column in London’s Trafalgar 
Square; see Chapter 11) defeated French forces under Napoleon. England 
also went to war again with the United States between 1812 and 1814, 
this time over the British practice of pressing American seamen into 
service in the British Navy.
It’s safe to say that by the time he began an address with “My Lords and 
Peacocks,” it was time for George to step down. Personal rule was given 
to his son George, the prince regent, in 1811. George III died blind, deaf, 
and mad at Windsor Castle (see Chapter 11) on January 29, 1820. You 
can see Kew Palace, his favorite residence, on a visit to the Royal 
Botanic Gardens (also known as Kew Gardens; see Chapter 11).

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
334
George IV (1762–1830): A Dandy 
King for the Regency
George IV, eldest son of George III and Charlotte, was the antithesis of 
his father (are you starting to see a pattern here?): conservative in his 
infrequent political involvement and licentious in affairs of the heart. As 
prince regent, he had many mistresses until he secretly married the 
Catholic widow Maria Fitzherbert in 1785. When George III found out 
about it, he had the marriage declared illegal because his son would 
have been ineligible to reign with a Catholic wife. In 1795, George IV mar-
ried again, this time to his cousin, Caroline of Brunswick, who was some-
thing of a slob and whom he detested. Caroline took their only child and 
moved to Italy, returning to England to claim the rights of queen when 
George succeeded his father in 1820. George created one of the greatest 
scandals of his reign when he had Caroline barred from his coronation.
Bright, witty, and able on the one hand, indolent, spoiled, and lazy on 
the other, George was in some ways the psychological forerunner of 
many modern royals. Although he was scandalous with his mistresses 
and extravagant in his spending, he was also a patron of the arts and 
donated his father’s immense book collection as the foundation of the 
British Library. His penchant for building projects inspired the Regency 
style of architecture, at its most fanciful in the Royal Pavilion in Brighton 
(see Chapter 14). But his extravagances came at a time of social distress 
and general misery, following the Napoleonic Wars and the tremendous 
changes brought forth by the Industrial Revolution. He was basically a 
party boy who couldn’t transcend his sense of royal entitlement to pro-
vide true leadership.
Queen Victoria (1819–1901): 
Mother of Monarchs
Victoria, who gave her name to an era, was the daughter of Edward, 
Duke of Kent and Strathearn, and Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Her 
father died when she was an infant, and her mother enacted a strict regi-
men that turned its back on the scandal-ridden courts of Victoria’s uncles, 
George IV and William IV. Popular respect for the Crown was at a low 
point at her coronation in 1837, but the modest and straightforward 
young queen, just 18 years old, eventually won the hearts of her subjects. 
She refused any further influence from her domineering mother, and 
though she had no direct input in policy decisions, she wanted to be 
informed of political matters. (After the Reform Act of 1832, legislative 
authority resided in the House of Lords, with executive authority resting 

 Chapter 19: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 335
within a cabinet comprised of members of the House of Commons; the 
monarch was essentially powerless.)
Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg in 1840, a marriage that 
was apparently happy and certainly fecund: She bore nine children. The 
public, however, was not fond of Victoria’s German prince, and Albert 
was excluded from holding any official political position, was never 
granted a title, and was named prince consort only after 17 years of mar-
riage. Victoria did nothing without her husband’s approval. His interests 
in art, science, and industry spurred him to organize the Crystal Palace 
Exhibition in 1851, a highly profitable industrial convention whose pro-
ceeds were used to purchase lands in Kensington for the establishment 
of several museums (one of which is the Victoria and Albert Museum; 
see Chapter 11). Following his death from typhoid in 1861, Victoria went 
into seclusion for more than 25 years, not emerging until the Golden 
Jubilee of 1887. An entire generation had never seen the face of their 
queen. In that period, she had the Albert Memorial erected in 
Kensington Gardens (see Chapter 11).
During her reign, the British Empire doubled in size, encompassing 
Australia, Canada, India, and various locales in Africa and the South 
Pacific. Victoria was named empress of India in 1878. England’s success in 
avoiding European conflicts for almost a century (1815–1914, the Crimean 
War of 1853–1856 being the major exception) was due, in large part, to the 
marriages Victoria arranged for her children. Either directly or by marriage, 
she was related to the royal houses of Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, 
Norway, Romania, Russia, and Sweden. Nicholas II of Russia married 
Victoria’s granddaughter Alexandra, and the dreaded emperor of 
Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm II, was her grandson “Willy.”
The era we now call Victorian England was one in which the queen’s 
rigid ethics and uninspired personal tastes generally reflected those of 
the middle class. When she died of old age, an entire era died with her.
Queen Elizabeth II (1926–): 
Monarchy Amidst Media
Elizabeth II, who became queen in 1952, is the best known of the seven 
remaining monarchs in Europe. The eldest daughter of George VI and 
Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, she married a distant cousin, Philip Mountbatten, 
in 1947 and had four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne; Andrew; 
and Edward. (For an account of some recent royal scandals involving 
Elizabeth’s kids and grandkids, see Chapter 2.)

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
336
In the modern world, where wealth and celebrity have taken the place of 
actual accomplishment, monarchs are basically privileged show dogs 
whose pedigrees allow them to amass enormous fortunes, live in a r
arified world, and be regarded as newsworthy for no reason other than 
that they’re royal. Seen in the unflattering light of her children, Elizabeth 
shines like an old-fashioned beacon of virtue and traditional values. She 
has never embarrassed her nation, and she is a hard and disciplined 
worker, the most widely traveled head of state in the world. She celebrated 
her Golden Jubilee in 2002 and appears determined to remain on the 
throne for quite some time — perhaps as long as Victoria.
And yet, overall, the popularity of the English monarchy is in sharp 
decline. In large part, this is because the disliked and derided Windsor 
children have tarnished the royal name. (Princess Diana was the only 
recent royal to reach the hearts of the public.) But it also has to do with 
a growing sense that the monarchy is simply irrelevant. The monarchy 
provides an enormous boost to tourism and sells a lot of books and news-
papers, but in a world of democratic models and historical amnesia, how 
can an elitist monarchy achieve any meaningful relationship to the public 
it’s expected to serve?
It’s hard to imagine England without a king or a queen and the traditions 
associated with royalty. And perhaps the monarchy is worth preserving 
for that reason alone.
One of my favorite stories about Elizabeth II appeared in a book by Paul 
Burrell (the queen’s butler), A Royal Duty. One night, the queen asked if 
he would like to accompany her as she viewed the latest likeness of her-
self sent from Madame Tussauds for her approval. The queen and her 
butler walked through the hallways and corridors of Buckingham Palace 
until they came to an enormous, dark drawing room. When the lights 
were switched on, they saw a lifelike effigy of the queen standing in the 
center of the room. Elizabeth slowly circled her wax twin, carefully scru-
tinizing her image; pronounced herself satisfied; turned off the lights; 
and left her twin in the dark.

your card in England (or elsewhere in 
Europe), or you may find usage blocked for 
security reasons.
In the United Kingdom, credit cards are usu-
ally accessed by using a four-digit PIN 
rather than by swiping them, but most busi-
nesses are also able to swipe U.S. cards.

British electrical current is 240 volts, AC 
cycle. You can’t plug North American or 
Australian appliances into the holes of 
British wall outlets without suitable convert-
ers or adapters (available from electrical-
supply shops). You can destroy the inner 
workings of your appliance (and possibly 
start a fire), if you plug a foreign appliance 
directly into a European electrical outlet 
without a transformer.

Holidays
Some local holidays won’t be familiar to 
non-Brits, particularly the spring and 
summer Bank Holidays (the last Mon in 
May and Aug), when everyone takes off for 
a long weekend. Most banks and many 
shops, museums, historic houses, and 
other places of interest are closed on Bank 
Holidays, and public transport services are 
reduced. The same holds true for other 
major British holidays: New Year’s Day, 
Good Friday (Fri before Easter), Easter 
Monday (day after Easter), May Day (first 
Mon in May), Christmas, and Boxing Day 
(Dec 26). The London crowds swell during 
school holidays: mid-July through early 
September, three weeks at Christmas and 
at Easter, a week in mid-October, and a 
week in mid-February.
Hospitals
The following hospitals offer 24-hour emer-

Legal Aid
In every case where legal aid is required 
by a foreign national within Britain, the 
British Tourist Authority advises visitors to 
contact their embassies.
Liquor Laws
You must be 18 to be served alcohol 
legally. Children 15 and under aren’t 
allowed in pubs, except in dining rooms, 
and then only when accompanied by a 
parent or guardian. Restaurants are 
allowed to serve liquor during the same 
hours as pubs (see “Business Hours,” ear-
lier in this Quick Concierge); however, only 
people who have a meal on the premises 
can be served a drink. In hotels, liquor may 
be served between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. to 
both guests and nonguests; after 11 p.m., 
only guests can get a drink.
Mail
A postcard or airmail letter to North 
America, Australia, and New Zealand 
costs 56p (90¢) for 10 grams. You can send 
mail within the United Kingdom first or 
second class. See “Post Offices,” later in 
this Quick Concierge.
Maps
You can get the best all-around street direc-
tory, London A–Z, at most newsstands and 
bookstores. You can obtain a bus and 
Underground map at any Underground 
station.
Newspapers and Magazines
The Times, The Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, 
and Evening Standard are all dailies carry-
ing the latest news. You can get copies of 
the International Herald Tribune, published 
in Paris, and an international edition of USA 
Today daily. You can also buy copies of 
Newsweek and Time at most newsstands. 
Magazines such as City Limits, Time Out,

24-hour pharmacy.
Police
In an emergency, dial % 999.
Post Offices
The Main Post Office, 24 William IV St., 
WC2 (% 020/7930-9580; Tube: Charing 
Cross), is open Monday through Saturday 
8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Other post offices and 
sub-post offices (windows in the backs of 
news agents) are open Monday through 
Friday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday 9 
a.m. to 12:30 p.m. For general post office 
information, go to www.royalmail.
com. Look for red POST OFFICE signs outside.
Restrooms
The English often call toilets loos. Loos are 
marked by PUBLIC TOILETS signs on streets, in 
parks, and in a few Tube stations. You can 
also find well-maintained lavatories that 
anybody can use in all larger public build-
ings, such as museums and art galleries, 
large department stores, and rail stations. 
You can usually use public lavatories for 
free, but you may need a 50p or even £1 
coin to get in or to use a proper washroom. 
In some places (like Leicester Square), you 
can find coin-operated “Super Loos” that 
are sterilized after each use. If all else 
fails, duck into the nearest pub.
Safety
Security in the London Underground was 
dramatically increased following the 2005 
terrorist attacks. In general, London is a 
safe city. As in any large metropolis, use 
common sense and normal caution when 
you’re in a crowded public area or walking 
alone at night. The area around Euston 
Station has more purse snatchings than 
anywhere else in London.
Smoking
As of July 2007, smoking is prohibited in all 
public areas throughout the United 
Kingdom, including restaurants and pubs. 
Nonsmoking rooms are available in an 
increasing number of hotels, and many 
B&Bs are now entirely smoke-free.
Taxes
The 17.5 percent value-added tax (VAT) is 
added to all hotel and restaurant bills and 
is included in the prices of many items that 
you purchase. You can get this tax refunded, 
if you shop at stores that participate in the 
Retail Export Scheme (signs are posted in the 
windows of participating stores). See 
Chapter 12 for more information on receiv-
ing a VAT refund.
Taxis
You can hail a cab from the street; if the FOR 
HIRE light is lit, the cab is available. You can 
phone for a cab at % 020/7272-0272.
Telephone
The country code for the United Kingdom 
is 44. London’s telephone area code is 020 
within the United Kingdom or 20 outside 
the United Kingdom. If you’re calling a 
London number from outside the city, use 
020 followed by the local number. If you’re 
calling a London number within London, 
leave off the 020 and dial only the local 
number.
For directory assistance in London and the 
rest of Britain, dial % 192.

 Appendix: Quick Concierge 341
To call England from the United States, 
Canada, and Australia dial 011-44, then the 
city code (20 for London), and the local 
phone number. For calls from New 
Zealand, dial 00-44, then the city code and 
the local phone number.
As in every other country around the world, 
the cellphone (called a “mobile” in the U.K.) 
has changed the landscape of public tele-
phone use in London and throughout the 
U.K. You can still find three types of public 
pay phones: those that take only coins 
(increasingly rare); those that accept only 
phone cards; and those that take phone 
cards, credit cards, and coins. You can get 
phone cards in various values — from £3 
($4.95) up to £20 ($33) — and you can reuse 
them until you use up the total value of the 
card. You can buy the cards from news-
stands and post offices. At coin-operated 
phones, insert your coins before dialing. 
The minimum charge is 40p (65¢). The credit 
card pay phone operates on credit cards — 
Access (MasterCard), American Express, 
Diners Club, and Visa.
To make an international call from London, 
dial the international access code (00), the 
country code, the area code, and the local 
number. Or call through one of the follow-
ing long-distance access codes: AT&T 
USA Direct (% 0800/890-011), Canada 
Direct (% 0800/890-016), Australia (% 0800/
890-061), or New Zealand (% 0800/890-
064). Common country codes are: United 
States and Canada, 1; Australia, 61; New 
Zealand, 64.
Time Zone
England follows Greenwich Mean Time. 
Most of the year, including summer, Britain 
is five hours ahead of the time observed on 
the East Coast of the United States. 
Because the United States and Britain 
observe daylight saving time at slightly dif-
ferent times of year, for a brief period 
(about a week) in autumn, London is only 
four hours ahead of New York, and for a 
brief period in spring, London is six hours 
ahead of New York.
Tipping
In restaurants, service charges of 15 per-
cent to 20 percent are often added to the 
bill. Sometimes, this tip is clearly marked; 
other times, it isn’t. When in doubt, ask. If 
service isn’t included, adding 10 percent to 
15 percent to the bill is customary. 
Sommeliers get about £1 ($1.65) per bottle 
of wine served. Tipping in pubs isn’t done, 
but in cocktail bars, the server usually gets 
about £1 ($1.65) per round of drinks. Tipping 
taxi drivers 10 percent to 15 percent of the 
fare is standard. Barbers and hairdressers 
expect 10 percent to 15 percent. Tour 
guides expect £2 ($3.30), although this tip 
isn’t mandatory. Theater ushers are not 
tipped.
Transit Info
For 24-hour information on London’s 
Underground, buses, and ferries, call 
% 020/7222-1234 or go online to www.
tfl.gov.uk.
Water
London’s water is safe to drink. Tap water 
is free in restaurants, so be sure to ask for 
it, if you don’t want to pay for bottled water.
Weather Updates

you go, check the BBC Web site at http:/
