What is Oracle VirtualBox?
•
VirtualBox is a free and open-source hypervisor for x86 computers 
currently being developed by Oracle Corporation
•
It installs on your existing Intel or AMD-based computers, whether 
they are running Windows, Mac, Linux or Solaris operating systems.  
It extends the capabilities of your existing computer so that it can 
run multiple operating systems on one hardware at the same time
