Exercise and hypoxia 

VC (vital capacity) = TV + IRV + ERV  
TLC (total lung capacity) = TV + IRV + ERV + RV  
FRC = ERV + RV 
Residual volume (RV) is the amount of air that must remain in the lungs. 
RV / TLC increases in disease 
 
obstructive – RV increases 
 
restrictive – TLC decreases 
Lung Volumes & Capacity

Remember These Terms 
•
Tidal Volume (TV) = volume of air entering the lung (inspiration) or 
the volume of air leaving the lung (expiration). [approx. 0.5L, but 
depends on body size)]. 
 
•
Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV) =  maximal amount of air that can 
be inspired above tidal volume. [approx. 3L]. 
 
•
Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) = volume remaining in the lung 
after a normal expiration. [approx. 2.5L]. Decreases if chest muscles 
are weak  ERV+RV 
 
•
Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV) = maximal volume of air expired 
after normal expiration. [approx. 1.5L]. 
 
•
Residual volume (RV) = volume of air at end of maximal expiration. 
[approx. 1L]. Can not be measured with a spirometer. 
 
•
Vital capacity (VC) = the maximal amount of air that a person can 
expire after maximal inspiration. VC = TV + IRV +ERV. 

Lung Diseases 
Obstructive – hard to expire (need positive pressure from 
chest wall to expire but that also closes airways), RV 
increases  
 
asthma (contraction of smooth muscle in airways due to 
inflammation), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease – chronic bronchitis or emphysema – alveoli are 
destroyed and have increased compliance, collapse of 
small airways) 
 
Restrictive – lungs can’t expand to a normal volume, 
smaller TLC 
 
fibrotic diseases (fibrosis, TB) or diseases that constrict the 
chest (scoliosis) 
 

1. Varies with lung size. 
Compliance decreases at 
high lung volumes.  
 
2. When compliance is  
abnormally low, the lung 
is stiff, inhalation is 
difficult but exhalation is 
easy. 
 
3. Increased compliance 
filling is easy, exhalation 
is difficult. 
Compliance = Distensibility 
Compliance is the change in lung volume after a change in transpulmonary pressure

Lung Compliance 
Elastic tissue 
emphysema -  destroys elastic tissue so compliance increases  
fibrosis - lungs are not as distensible so compliance decreases 
 
Surfactant 
reduces surface tension of water in alveoli (attractive forces) 
detergent like molecule – hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions 
 
made by alveolar Type II cells (stretch activates release) 
other types of surfactant molecules are part of lung defense system 
 

SURFACTANT stabilizes alveoli 
 
pressure = 2T/ r (Law of Laplace). Without surfactant, pressure would 
be greater in smaller alveoli. Surfactant lowers surface tension more in 
smaller alveoli. 
 
   
 
Lung Surface Tension 
1 
without 
surfactant 
2 
if surface tension is equal,  
then pressure will be greater in #1 
since it has a smaller radius 
(P=2T/r) 
1 
with 
surfactant 
2 
since surface tension in #1 is lower,  
then the pressure in #1 and #2 is equal 
(P=2T/r) 

Key Concepts 
 
•
Total lung capacity comprises several volumes and 
overlapping capacities. All can be measured by a 
spirometer except residual volume (RV), functional 
reserve capacity (FRC), and total lung capacity.  
 
•
Compliance is a measure of lung distensibility. In 
restrictive lung disease (fibrosis) the lung has low 
compliance (i.e., hard to inflate). In the obstructive 
lung disease, (emphysema) the lungs have high 
compliance (i.e., easy to inflate but hard to 
deflate) due to loss of elastin fibers.
