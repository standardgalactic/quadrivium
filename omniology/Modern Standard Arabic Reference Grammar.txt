A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic is a comprehensive handbook on
the structure of Arabic. Keeping technical terminology to a minimum, it
provides a detailed yet accessible overview of Modern Standard Arabic in
which the essential aspects of its phonology, morphology, and syntax can be
readily looked up and understood. Accompanied by extensive carefully
chosen examples, it will prove invaluable as a practical guide for supporting
students’ textbooks, classroom work, or self-study and will also be a useful
resource for scholars and professionals wishing to develop an understanding
of the key features of the language. Grammar notes are numbered for ease of
reference, and a section on how to use an Arabic dictionary is included, as
well as helpful glossaries of Arabic and English linguistic terms and a useful
bibliography. Clearly structured and systematically organized, this book is set
to become the standard guide to the grammar of contemporary Arabic.

Contents

This basic reference grammar is intended as a handbook for the general learner –
a step on the way toward greater understanding of the Arabic language. Many
excellent and effective textbooks for teaching Classical Arabic and Modern Stan-
dard Arabic (MSA) exist, as well as published research on a range of topics in
Arabic linguistics (e.g., phonology, morphology, syntax, variation theory), but
information in English on MSA grammatical topics tends to be scattered, and if a
complete answer to a question regarding contemporary usage is needed, some-
times a number of sources need to be consulted.
The idea behind this reference grammar is to gather together in one work the
essentials of MSA in such a way that fundamental elements of structure can be
readily looked up and illustrated. It is intended primarily for learners of MSA as a
practical guide for supporting their textbook lessons, classroom work, or self-
study. This book is not intended in any way to supplant the exhaustive and pro-
found analyses of classical and literary Arabic such as those by Wright (1896,
reprint 1967) and Cantarino (1974–76). Those monumental books stand on their
own and are irreplaceable reference works. This book is a work of considerably
more modest goals and proportions.
1 Goals
This book is not designed to cover the entire field of literary or classical Arabic
grammar. A comprehensive accounting of Arabic grammar is an undertaking of
great complexity and depth, of competing indigenous paradigms (Basran and
Kufan), of several dimensions (diachronic, synchronic, comparative), and of theo-
retical investigation across the spectrum of contemporary linguistic fields (e.g.,
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, and dis-
course analysis).
The Arabic language is a vast treasure-house of linguistic and literary resources
that extend back into the first millennium. Its grammatical tradition is over a
thousand years old and contains resources of extraordinary depth and sophisti-
cation. Works in English such as Lane’s dictionary (1863, reprint 1984), Wehr’s
dictionary (fourth edition, 1979), Wright’s grammar (1896, reprint 1967), and
Preface
xvii

Howell’s grammar (reprint 1986) are seminal contributions in English to under-
standing the wealth of the Arabic linguistic tradition. Yet, for the neophyte, for
the average learner, or for the non-specialized linguist, easily usable reference
works are still needed. This is, therefore, not a comprehensive reference grammar
covering the full range of grammatical structures in both Classical and Modern
Standard Arabic; rather, it centers on the essentials of modern written Arabic
likely to be encountered in contemporary Arabic expository prose.
2 Methodology
The choices of explanations, examples, and layouts of paradigms in this book are
pragmatically motivated rather than theoretically motivated and are not intended
to reflect a particular grammatical or theoretical approach. I have been eclectic in
providing descriptions of Arabic language features and structures, always with the
intent of providing the most efficient access to Arabic forms and structures for Eng-
lish speakers. For example, I have assigned numbers to noun declensions for ease of
reference. Also, I refer throughout the text to “past tense” and “present tense” verbs
rather than “perfect” tense and “imperfect” tense verbs, although this has not been
standard practice for Arabic textbooks or grammars.1 I refer to the “locative
adverbs” (Zuruuf makaan wa-Zuruuf zamaan) as “semi-prepositions” (following
Kouloughli 1994) because it captures their similarities to prepositions.2
Many Arabic terms and classifications, however, such as the “sisters of √inna”
and the “sisters of kaan-a” are highly useful and pragmatic ways of organizing and
presenting morphological and syntactic information, even to nonnative speakers
of Arabic, so they have been retained. I have endeavored to provide both English
and Arabic technical terms for categorized phenomena.
There are those, both traditionalists and non-traditionalists, who will no doubt
disagree with the mode of presentation and grammatical descriptions used in
this book. However, since this text is aimed at learners and interested laypeople as
well as linguists, I hope that the categories devised and the descriptions and
examples provided will be useful, readable, and readily understandable. Translit-
eration is provided for all examples so that readers who do not have a grasp of
Arabic script may have access to phonological structure. 
3 The database
This reference grammar is based on contemporary expository prose, chiefly but
not exclusively from Arabic newspapers and magazines, as the main resource for
xviii Preface
1 See the rationale for this choice in Chapter 21 on verb inflection, section 1.2.2.

“quasi-prépositions.” (152).

topics and examples of current everyday Arabic writing practice. The grammatical
description that emerges therefore calibrates closely with contemporary written
usage. Media Arabic was chosen as a main source of data for this text because of
its contemporaneousness, its coverage of many different topics, and the extempo-
rary nature of daily reporting and editing. As a primary source of information
about and from the Arab world, newspaper and magazine language reflects Arab
editorial and public opinion and topics of current interest.3 Various subject mat-
ter and texts were covered, ranging from interviews, book reviews, feature stories,
religion and culture, and sports reports, to straight news reports and editorials. In
addition to newspapers, other sources used for data collection included contem-
porary novels and nonfiction. This is therefore strictly a descriptive grammar that
seeks to describe MSA as it is within the parameters noted above, and not to
evaluate it or compare it with earlier or more elegant and elaborate forms of the
written language.
There are doubtless those who would assert that the ordinariness of media lan-
guage causes it to lack the beauty and expressiveness of literary Arabic, and there-
fore that it is unrepresentative of the great cultural and literary achievements of
the Arabs.4 To those I would reply that the very ordinariness of this type of lan-
guage is what makes it valuable to learners because it represents a widely used
and understood standard of written expression. As Owens and Bani-Yasin (1987,
736) note, “the average Arab is probably more exposed to this style than to most
others, such as academic or literary writing.” In fact, it is a vital and emergent
form of written language, being created and recreated on a daily basis, covering
issues from the mundane to the extraordinary. With limited time to prepare its
presentation style, media Arabic reflects more closely than other forms of the
written language the strategies and structures of spontaneous expression.5
Media Arabic is straightforward enough in its content and style to form the
basis for advanced levels of proficiency and comprehension, to expand vocabu-
lary, to create confidence in understanding a wide range of topics, and particu-

3 Media discourse is described by Bell and Garrett (1998, 3) as “a rich resource of readily accessible
data for research and teaching” and its usage “influences and represents people’s use of and
attitudes towards language in a speech community.”  They also state that “the media reflect and
influence the formation and expression of culture, politics and social life” (1998, 4).
4 Cantarino, for example, in the introduction to his major work, The Syntax of Modern Arabic Prose,
vol. I, states that in compiling his illustrative materials,  he consulted a variety of literary sources,
but “Newspapers have generally been disregarded, since Arabic journalism – like most news
writing around the world – does not necessarily offer the best or most representative standard of
literary language” (1974, 1:x).
5 The discipline of “media discourse research” or “media discourse analysis” is a rapidly growing
one in linguistics.  See Cotter 2001 for an overview of developments in this field.   See also the

larly to provide clear reference points for issues of structural accuracy.6 As
Widdowson has stated, students whose future contexts of use are broad and not
clearly predictable need fundamental exposure to “a language of wider commu-
nication, a language of maximal generality or projection value” (1988, 7). I see
media language as a cornerstone of linguistic and cultural literacy in Arabic; a
medium which can be a useful goal in itself, but also a partial and practical goal
for those who ultimately aim to study the Arabic literary tradition in all its ele-
gance, diversity, and richness.
4 Contents
The book is arranged so that grammar notes are numbered and indexed for ease
of reference; examples provided are based on information in the database. I have
omitted or avoided names of persons and sometimes I have changed the content
words to be less specific. For the most part, I have not created ad hoc examples;
illustrations of syntactic structure are based on authentic usage. A section on how
to use an Arabic dictionary is provided, as well as lists of Arabic and English tech-
nical terms, a bibliography that includes specialized and general works in Arabic,
English, French, and German, and indexes based on Arabic terms and English
terms.
Although I have tried to cover a wide range of aspects of contemporary written
Arabic usage, there are bound to be lacunae, for which I am responsible. In terms
of accuracy of description, the entire book has been submitted to native Arabic-
speaking scholars and professional linguists for checking the grammatical
descriptions and examples, but I alone am responsible for any shortcomings in
that respect. 
Procedures:
•
Proper names have been left unvoweled on the final consonant, except where
the voweling illustrates the grammatical point under discussion.
•
For individual words or word groups taken out of context, the nominative
case is used as the base or citation form.
•
In giving English equivalents for Arabic structures, I have included in square
brackets [ ] words inserted into English that are not present in the Arabic text
but are necessary for understanding in English.
•
I have included in parentheses and single quotes (‘ ’) a more or less exact word-
ing in the Arabic text that does not appear in the English equivalent.

Preface
6 In his article “Broadcast news as a language standard,” Allan Bell discusses the central role of
media in reinforcing and disseminating a prestige standard language, especially in multilingual,
multi-dialectal, or diglossic societies. See Bell 1983.

•
In running text, English equivalents of Arabic lexical items are referred to in
single quotes ‘’.
•
In giving English equivalents for Arabic lexical items, essentially synonymous
English meanings are separated by commas, whereas a semicolon separates
equivalents with substantially different meanings.
•
For purposes of brevity, in providing English equivalents of lexical items with
broad semantic ranges, I have selected only one or two common meanings.
These are not meant to be full definitions, only very basic glosses.

I am indebted to my first editor at Cambridge University Press, Kate Brett, for
encouraging and shepherding this project in its initial stages. I gratefully
acknowledge the support and help of my subsequent Cambridge editor, Helen
Barton, who saw this project through its final stages, to Alison Powell and her
production team, and to Jacque French for her careful copy editing. Deepest
thanks go to Roger Allen and Mahdi Alosh, to my Georgetown colleagues Mohssen
Esseesy, Serafina Hager, Margaret Nydell, Irfan Shahid, and Barbara Stowasser;
and especially to David Mehall, who worked closely with me in editing and pro-
viding the Arabic script of the text. 
I would also like to express my deep appreciation to Dr. Omar Al-Zawawi, Spe-
cial Advisor to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, Sultan of Oman.
Much gratitude is owed to my colleague Amin Bonnah who advised me
throughout my research on knotty grammatical questions, and whose insight
into and knowledge of the Arabic grammatical system is encyclopedic and
unmatched. Invariably, when I had doubts or questions about particular struc-
tures or usages, I consulted Dr. Bonnah. Invariably, he had the answer or was able
to find it out. If this reference grammar is found useful and valid, it is largely due
to his guidance and contributions.
Any gaps, omissions, errors, or other infelicities in this text are my responsibil-
ity alone.
Sincere thanks go to all the faculty and students in the Arabic Department at
Georgetown University who tolerated my obsession with collecting data, drafting,
and compiling the book over a number of years. And I want to thank my husband,
Victor Litwinski, who through his caring support and virtuoso editing skills made
it possible for me to complete this project.

Arabic is a Semitic language akin to Hebrew, Aramaic, and Amharic, and more dis-
tantly related to indigenous language families of North Africa. It possesses a rich
literary heritage dating back to the pre-Islamic era, and during the rise and
expansion of the Islamic empire (seventh to twelfth centuries, AD), it became the
official administrative language of the empire as well as a leading language of
international scholarly and scientific communication. It is today the native
language of over 200 million people in twenty different countries as well as the
liturgical language for over a billion Muslims throughout the world. 
1 Afro-Asiatic and the Semitic language family
The Semitic language family is a member of a broader group of languages, termed
Afro-Asiatic (also referred to as Hamito-Semitic). This group includes four
subfamilies in addition to Semitic, all of which are indigenous languages of North
Africa: (1) Tamazight (Berber) in the Northwest (Morocco, Mauretania, Algeria,
Tunisia and Libya); (2) the Chad languages (including Hausa) in the Northwest
Central area; (3) ancient Egyptian and Coptic; and (4) the Cushitic languages of
Northeast Africa (Somalia, the Horn of Africa).1 The Semitic part of the family was
originally based farthest East, in the Levant, the Fertile Crescent, and the Arabian
peninsula.
Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic (including Syriac), and Amharic are living language
members of the Semitic group, but extinct languages such as Akkadian (Assyrian
and Babylonian), Canaanite, and Phoenician are also Semitic. The Semitic lan-
guage family has a long and distinguished literary history and several of its
daughter languages have left written records of compelling interest and impor-
tance for the history of civilization.2

2 An overview of Arabic language history
The earliest stages of the Arabic language (Proto-Arabic or Old Arabic) are docu-
mented from about the seventh century BC until approximately the third century
AD, but because of the paucity of written records, little is known about the nature
of the language of those times. The only written evidence is in the form of
epigraphic material (brief rock inscriptions and graffiti) found in northwest and
central Arabia.3
The next period, the third through fifth centuries, is usually referred to as Early
Arabic, a transitional period during which the language evolved into a closer sem-
blance of Classical Arabic. There are again few literary artifacts from this age, but
it is known that there was extensive commercial and cultural interaction with
Christian and Jewish cultures during this time, an era of both Roman and Byzan-
tine rule in the Levant and the Fertile Crescent.4
3 Classical Arabic
The start of the literary or Classical Arabic era is usually calculated from the sixth
century, which saw a vigorous flourishing of the Arabic literary (or poetic) lan-
guage, especially in public recitation and oral composition of poetry, a refined
and highly developed formal oral art practiced by all Arab tribal groups and
held in the highest esteem. During the sixth century, the Arabic ode, or qaSîda,
evolved to its highest and most eloquent form. It was characterized by sophisti-
cated metrics and a “highly conventionalized scheme . . . upwards of sixty cou-
plets all following an identical rhyme.”5
The form of language used in these odes is often referred to as the standard
poetic language or the poetic koinè, and there are conflicting theories as to its
nature – whether it was an elevated, distinctive, supra-tribal language shared by
the leadership of the Arabic-speaking communities, or whether it was the actual
vernacular of a region or tribe which was adopted by poets as a shared vehicle
for artistic expression. In particular, debate has centered around the existence
and use of desinential (i.e., word-final) case and mood inflection, a central fea-
ture of classical poetry but one which fell increasingly out of use in spoken Ara-
bic, and which no longer exists in the urban vernaculars of today. Since little is

known about the nature of the everyday spoken Arabic of pre-Islamic times or
the different levels of linguistic formality that might have been used on differ-
ent occasions, certainty has not been reached on this point, although theories
abound.6
In the seventh century AD the Prophet Muhammad was gifted over a period of
years (622–632 AD) with the revelation of verses which constituted a holy book,
the Qur√ân, in Arabic, which became the key text of the new monotheistic reli-
gion, Islam. The text was rendered into an official version during the reign of the
Caliph cUthmân (644–656 AD). From that time on, Arabic was not only a language
of great poetic power and sophistication, but also permanently sacralized; as the
chosen language for the Qur√ân, it became the object of centuries of religious
study and exegesis, theological analysis, grammatical analysis and speculation.7
Throughout the European medieval period, from the seventh through the twelfth
centuries, the Arabic-speaking world and the Islamic empire expanded and
flourished, centered first in Mecca and Madina, then Damascus, and then Bagh-
dad.8 Arabic became an international language of civilization, culture, scientific
writing and research, diplomacy, and administration. From the Iberian peninsula
in the West to Central and South Asia in the East stretched the world of Islam, and
the influence of Arabic. The vast empire eventually weakened under the growing
influence and power of emerging independent Muslim dynasties, with inroads
made by the Crusades, Mongol invasions from the East, and with the expulsion of
Muslims from the Iberian peninsula in the West. Arabic remained the dominant
language in North Africa, the Levant, the Fertile Crescent, and the Arabian Penin-
sula, but lost ground to indigenous languages such as Persian in the East, and
Spanish in the West.9
The language era from the thirteenth century to the eighteenth is generally
known as “Middle Arabic,” although there is some ambiguity to this term.10 During
this time, the Classical Arabic of early Islam remained the literary language, but the
spoken Arabic of everyday life shifted into regional variations, each geographical

in Damascus (661–750 AD); and the Abbasids, based in Baghdad (750–1258 AD).
9 Arabic has remained the dominant language in countries where the substratum language was orig-
inally Semitic or Afro-Asiatic, but not where the substratum languages were Indo-European, such as
Persia or the Iberian peninsula. Aside from nationalistic and political considerations, linguistic
compatibility between Arabic and its sister languages may have enabled certain populations to
adapt more easily and throughly to Arabic. See Bateson 1967 (2003), 72–73 on this topic.
10 Versteegh (1997, 114–29) has a cogent discussion of the issues related to “Middle Arabic.” See also
Blau 1961.

area evolving a characteristic vernacular.11 The spoken variants of Arabic were not
generally written down and therefore not preserved or anchored in any way to for-
malize them, to give them literary status or grammatical legitimacy. They continued
to evolve along their own lively and supple paths, calibrating to the changes of every-
day life over the centuries, but never reaching the status of separate languages.12
4 The modern period
The modern period of Arabic dates approximately from the end of the eighteenth
century, with the spread of literacy, the concept of universal education, the incep-
tion of journalism, and exposure to Western writing practices and styles such as
editorials, short stories, plays, and novels. Many linguists make a distinction
between Classical Arabic (CA), the name of the literary language of the previous
eras, and the modern form of literary Arabic, commonly known (in English) as
Modern Standard Arabic ( MSA). Differences between CA and MSA are primarily in
style and vocabulary, since they represent the written traditions of very different
historical and cultural eras, from the early medieval period to the modern. In
terms of linguistic structure, CA and MSA are largely but not completely similar.
Within MSA, syntax and style range from complex and erudite forms of discourse
in learned usage to more streamlined expression in the journalistic, broadcast-
ing, and advertising worlds. The high degree of similarity between CA and MSA
gives strong continuity to the literary and Islamic liturgical tradition.
In Arabic, both CA and MSA are referred to as al-lugha al-fuSHâ ≈ë°üØdG á¨∏dG, or
simply, al-fuSHâ ≈ë°üØdG, which means “the most eloquent (language).” Badawi
(1985) draws a helpful distinction between fuSHâ al-caSr ô°ü©dG ≈ë°üa (of the mod-
ern era) (MSA) and fuSHâ al-turâth çGÎdG ≈ë°üa (of heritage) (CA). This is by no
means a clear or universally accepted delineation, and opinion in the Arab world
is apparently divided as to the scope and definition of the term fuSHâ ≈ë°üa.13
4
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
11 There is speculation that the written/spoken Arabic dichotomy began much earlier, during the
ninth century.  See Blau 1961, Versteegh 1984, Fück 1955.  For an evaluation of the main theories
of Arabic dialect evolution and an extensive bibliography on the topic, see Miller 1986 and Bateson
1967 (2003), 94–114.
12 This contrasts distinctively with the situation in the Scandinavian countries, for example, where a
similar situation prevailed in that a mother language, known as Common Scandinavian, prevailed
from about AD 550–1050, and then evolved into six official, literary languages (Danish, Dano-
Norwegian, New-Norwegian, Swedish, Faroese, and Icelandic), plus many dialects. Despite the fact
that the offshoots are all considered independent languages, “within this core [mainland
Scandinavia] speakers normally expect to be understood [by each other] when speaking their
native languages” (Haugen 1976, 23–24).
13 See Parkinson’s informative 1991 article for an extensive discussion of fuSHâ. In his study of
Egyptian native Arabic speakers’ ability with fuSHâ, he came to the conclusion that “The impor-
tant point here is that people do not agree on a term, and that further they do not agree on what
specific part of the communicative continuum, i.e., what specific varieties, any particular term
should refer to” (33).

5 Arabic today
The Arab world today is characterized by a high degree of linguistic and cultural
continuity. Arabic is the official language of all the members of the Arab League,
from North Africa to the Arabian Gulf.14 Although geography (including great dis-
tances and land barriers such as deserts and mountains) accounts for much of the
diversity of regional vernaculars, a shared history, cultural background and (to a
great extent) religion act to unify Arab society and give it a profound sense of
cohesion and identity.
MSA is the language of written Arabic media, e.g., newspapers, books, journals,
street signs, advertisements – all forms of the printed word. It is also the language
of public speaking and news broadcasts on radio and television. This means that
in the Arab world one needs to be able to comprehend both the written and the
spoken forms of MSA. However, in order to speak informally with people about
ordinary everyday topics, since there is no universally agreed-upon standard
speech norm, Arabs are fluent in at least one vernacular form of Arabic (their
mother tongue), and they understand a wide range of others. This coexistence of
two language varieties, the everyday spoken vernacular and a higher literary form
is referred to in linguistic terms as “diglossia.”
5.1 Diglossia
The divergence among the several vernacular forms of Arabic, and between the
vernaculars as a whole and the standard written form, make the linguistic situ-
ation of the Arab world a complex one.15 Instead of having one universally
agreed-upon standard speech norm, each major region of the Arab world (such
as the Levant, the Arabian Gulf, the western Arabian peninsula, western North
Africa, Egypt, and the Sudan) has as its own speech norm, a spoken vernacular
coexistent with the written standard – MSA. Vernacular speech is much more
flexible and mutable than the written language; it easily coins words, adapts
and adopts foreign expressions, incorporates the latest cultural concepts and
trends, and propagates slang, thus producing and reflecting a rich, creative,
and constantly changing range of innovation. Vernacular or colloquial lan-
guages have evolved their own forms of linguistic artistry and tradition in terms
of popular songs, folk songs, punning and jokes, folktales and spontaneous per-
formance art.

Kuwait, Bahrein, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.  
15 For more on diglossia, see Ferguson 1959a and 1996, and Walters, 1996. See also Southwest Journal of
Linguistics 1991, which is a special issue devoted to diglossia. Haeri 2003 is a book-length study of
the relationships among Classical Arabic, MSA, and colloquial Arabic in Egypt.

Their changeability, however, also means that Arabic vernaculars may vary sub-
stantially from one another in proportion to their geographical distance. That is,
neighboring vernacular dialects such as Jordanian and Syrian are easily mutually
intelligible to native Arabic speakers; however, distant regional dialects, such as
Moroccan and Kuwaiti, have evolved cumulative differences which result in the
need for conscious effort on the part of the speakers to accommodate each other
and adjust their everyday language to a more mainstream level. Educated native
Arabic speakers have enough mutual awareness of dialect characteristics that
they can identify and adjust rapidly and naturally to the communicative needs of
any situation.16 This spontaneous yet complex adjustment made by Arabic speak-
ers depends on their knowledge of the vast reservoir of the mutually understood
written language, which enables them to intercommunicate. Therefore, Arabic
speakers share a wealth of resources in their common grasp of the literary lan-
guage, MSA, and they can use this as a basis even for everyday communication. 
In the re-calibration of Arabic speech to be less regionally colloquial and more
formal, however, some researchers have identified another variation on spoken
Arabic, an intermediate level that is termed “cultivated,” “literate,” “formal,” or
“educated” spoken Arabic.17 Thus, the Arabic language situation is characterized
not simply as a sharp separation between written forms and spoken forms, but as
a spectrum or continuum of gradations from “high” (very literary or formal) to
“low” (very colloquial), with several levels of variation in between.18 As Elgibali
states (1993, 76), “we do not . . . have intuition or scholarly consensus concerning
the number, discreteness and/or stability of the middle level(s).”
These levels are characterized by (at least) two different sociolinguistic dimen-
sions: first, the social function; that is, the situations in which speakers find
themselves – whether those situations are, for example, religious, formal, aca-
demic, casual or intimate. Secondly, these levels are conditioned by the educa-
tional and regional backgrounds of the speakers. In this intricate interplay of
speech norms, situations, and backgrounds, educated native Arabic speakers eas-
ily find their way, making spontaneous, subtle linguistic adjustments to suit the
dimensions of the occasion and the interlocutors.

17 This is known as “cultivated” speech in Arabic: ﬁâmmiyyat al-muthaqqafînÚØq≤ãŸG  á«qeÉY, or 
lughat al-muthaqqafînÚØq≤ãŸG á¨d. A number of Arabic linguists have researched and discussed
this phenomenon, but there is no consensus as to the nature, extent, definition, and use of this
part of the Arabic language continuum.  The focus of the dispute centers around the ill-defined
and unstable nature of this particular form of spoken Arabic and whether or not it can be
distinguished as an identifiable linguistic level of Arabic.  For more discussion of this point, see
Badawi 1985, Elgibali 1993, El-Hassan 1978, Hary 1996, Mitchell 1986, Parkinson 1993, and Ryding
1990 and 1991.
18 See, for example, the five levels distinguished in Badawi 1985 and the “multiglossia” of Hary 1996.

5.2 Modern Standard Arabic: MSA
MSA is the written norm for all Arab countries as well as the major medium of
communication for public speaking and broadcasting.19 It serves not only as the
vehicle for current forms of literature, but also as a resource language for com-
munication between literate Arabs from geographically distant parts of the Arab
world. A sound knowledge of MSA is a mark of prestige, education, and social
standing; the learning of MSA by children helps eliminate dialect differences and
initiates Arab children into their literary heritage and historical tradition. It aids
in articulating the connections between Arab countries and creating a shared
present as well as a shared past. Education in the Arab countries universally
reinforces the teaching and maintenance of MSA as the single, coherent standard
written language.
A number of excellent Western pedagogical texts have been developed over the
past fifty years in which MSA is discussed, described, and explained to learners of
Arabic as a foreign language.20 However, up to this point, there has been no com-
prehensive reference grammar designed for use by western students of MSA.
5.3 Arabic academies
Grammatical and lexical conservatism are hallmarks of MSA. Arabic language
academies exist in several Arab capitals (Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad, Amman) to
determine and regulate the procedures for incorporation of new terminology,
and to conserve the overall integrity of MSA.21 Although foreign words are often
borrowed into Arabic, especially for ever-expanding technical items and fields,
the academies try to control the amount of borrowing and to introduce and
encourage Arabic-derived equivalents, such as the Arabic word hâtif ∞JÉg (pl.
hawâtif ∞JGƒg) for ‘telephone’ (based on the Arabic lexical root h-t-f ), to counteract
the widespread use of the Arabized European term: tiliifûn ¿ ƒØ«∏pJ.
According to Versteegh (1997, 178) “From the start, the goal of the Academy was
twofold: to guard the integrity of the Arabic language and preserve it from dialec-
tal and foreign influence, on the one hand, and to adapt the Arabic language to
the needs of modern times, on the other.” Another researcher states 
Arab academies have played a large role in the standardization of modern written
and formal Arabic, to an extent that today throughout the Arab world there is more
or less one modern standard variety. This is the variety used in newspapers, newsreel

broadcasting, educational books, official and legal notices, academic materials, and
instructional texts of all kinds. The three academies that have had the greatest influ-
ence are those based in Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad. Among the common objec-
tives of these academies is the development of a common MSA for all Arabic-speaking
peoples.
(Abdulaziz 1986, 17).
5.4 Deﬁnitions of MSA
A fully agreed-upon definition of MSA does not yet exist, but there is a general
consensus that modern Arabic writing in all its forms constitutes the basis of the
identity of the language. Modern writing, however, covers an extensive range of
discourse styles and genres ranging from complex and conservative to innovative
and experimental. Finding a standard that is delimited and describable within
this great range is a difficult task; however, there is an identifiable segment of the
modern Arabic written language used for media purposes, and it has been the
focus of linguists’ attention for a number of years because of its stability, its per-
vasiveness, and its ability to serve as a model of contemporary written usage. Dis-
semination of a written (and broadcast) prestige standard by the news media is a
widespread phenomenon, especially in multilingual, diglossic, and multi-dialectal
societies. 
One of the most complete descriptions of MSA is found in Vincent Monteil’s
L’arabe moderne in which he refers to “le néo-arabe” as “l’arabe classique, ou
régulier, ou écrit, ou littéral, ou littéraire, sous sa forme moderne” (1960, 25). That
is, he understands “modern Arabic” to be the modern version of the old classical
language. He also states that “on pourrait aussi le traiter d’arabe ‘de presse’, étant
donné le rôle déterminant qu’a joué, et que joue encore, dans sa diffusion . . .
lughat al-jarâ√id” (1960, 27). Defining MSA through its function as the language of
the Arabic news media is a useful way to delimit it since it is not officially codified
as a phenomenon separate from Classical Arabic and because Arabic speakers and
Arabic linguists have differing opinions on what constitutes what is referred to as
al-lugha al-fuSHâ. As Monteil also remarks, “s’il est exact de reconnaître . . . que
l’arabe moderne ‘se trouve être une langue assez artificielle, une langue plus ou
moins fabriquée’ plutôt qu’un ‘usage codifié,’ il faut déclarer . . . que ‘c’est une
langue vivante’ et qui ‘correspond à un besoin vital’” (1960, 28). It is these charac-
teristics of newspaper language, its vitality and practicality, that make it a prime
example of modern written Arabic usage.
Elsaid Badawi’s phrase, fuSHâ al-caSr ô°ü©dG ≈ë°üa, is his Arabic term for MSA
(1985, 17), which he locates on a continuum (at “level two”) between Classical Ara-
bic (“level one” ) and Educated Spoken Arabic (“level three”). As he points out, the
levels “are not segregated entities,” (1985, 17) but shade into each other gradually.
He identifies level two (MSA) as “mostly written” rather than spoken, and levels
8

two and three as essentially “in complementary distribution” with each other
(1985, 19), that is, they function in separate spheres, with some overlap.
Leslie McLoughlin, in his 1972 article “Towards a definition of Modern Standard
Arabic,” attempts to identify distinctive features of MSA from one piece of “qual-
ity journalism” (57) and provides the following definition which he borrows from
M. F. Sacîd: “that variety of Arabic that is found in contemporary books, newspa-
pers, and magazines, and that is used orally in formal speeches, public lectures,
learned debates, religious ceremonials, and in news broadcasts over radio and tel-
evision” (58). Whereas Sacîd states that MSA grammar is explicitly defined in
grammar books (which would bring it close to CA), McLoughlin finds several
instances in which MSA differs from CA, some of which are lexical and some of
which are syntactic (72–73).
In her Arabic Language Handbook (1967; 2003, 84), Mary Catherine Bateson iden-
tified three kinds of change that differentiate MSA from CA: (1) a “series of
‘acceptable’ simplifications” in syntactic structures, (2) a “vast shift in the lexicon
due to the need for technical terminology,” and (3) a “number of stylistic changes
due to translations from European languages and extensive bilingualism.”
In the research done for this book, a wide variety of primarily expository texts,
including Arabic newspaper and magazine articles, as well as other forms of MSA,
were consulted and put into a database over a period of ten years. The morpho-
logical and syntactic features of the language used in these writings were then
analyzed and categorized. This resulted in the finding that few structural incon-
sistencies exist between MSA and CA; the major differences are stylistic and lexi-
cal rather than grammatical. Particular features of MSA journalistic style include
more flexible word order, coinage of neologisms, and loan translations from west-
ern languages, especially the use of the √iDaafa áaÉ°VEG or annexation structure to
provide equivalents for compound words or complex concepts. It is just this abil-
ity to reflect and embody change while maintaining the major grammatical con-
ventions and standards that make journalistic Arabic in particular, a lively and
widely understood form of the written language and, within the style spectrum of
Arabic as a whole, a functional written standard for all Arab countries.
Introduction to Arabic

This chapter covers the essentials of script and orthography as well as MSA phono-
logical structure, rules of sound distribution and patterning, pronunciation con-
ventions, syllable structure, and word stress. Four features of Arabic script are
distinctive: first, it is written from right to left; second, letters within words are
connected in cursive style rather than printed individually; third, short vowels
are normally invisible; and finally, there is no distinction between uppercase and
lowercase letters. These features can combine to make Arabic script seem impen-
etrable to a foreigner at first. However, there are also some features of Arabic
script that facilitate learning it. First of all, it is reasonably phonetic; that is, there
is a good fit between the way words are spelled and the way they are pronounced.
And secondly, word structure and spelling are very systematic. 
1 The alphabet
There are twenty-eight Arabic consonant sounds, twenty-six of which are consis-
tently consonants, but two of which – waaw and yaa√– are semivowels that serve
two functions, sometimes as consonants and other times as vowels, depending on
context.1 For the most part, the Arabic alphabet corresponds to the distinctive
sounds (phonemes) of Arabic, and each sound or letter has a name.2 Arabic letter
shapes vary because Arabic is written in cursive style, that is, the letters within a
word are systematically joined together, as in English handwriting. There is no
option in Arabic for “printing” or writing each letter of a word in independent
form. There is no capitalization in Arabic script and therefore no distinction
between capital and small letters. Letters are instead distinguished by their posi-
tion in a word, i.e., whether they are word-initial, medial, or final. This is true

Phonology and script
1 “Certain consonants have some of the phonetic properties of vowels . . . they are usually referred
to as approximants (or frictionless continuants), though [/w/ and /y/] are commonly called
semivowels, as they have exactly the same articulation as vowel glides. Although phonetically
vowel-like, these sounds are usually classified along with consonants on functional grounds”
Crystal 1997, 159. See also section 4.2.2. this chapter.

language, see Gordon, 1970, 193–97.

both in printed Arabic and in handwriting. Handwriting is not covered in this
text, but there are several excellent books that provide instruction in it.3
Every letter has four possible shapes: word-initial, medial, final, and separate.
The following table gives the names of the sounds of Arabic listed in dictionary or
alphabetical order, along with their shapes:4

4 There is an older order which is not used for organizing dictionary entries, but which is used in
presenting elements of a text in outline, much as English speakers would make points A., B., and
C. That order is called the √abjad, and is usually recited in the form of words: √abjad, hawwaz,

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
The cursive nature of Arabic script, as shown above, requires several forms for
each letter. Most letters are joined to others on both sides when they are medial,
but there are a few that are called “non-connectors” which are attached to a pre-
ceding letter, but not to a following letter. The non-connectors are: √alif, daal,
dhaal, raa√, zaay, and waaw, as shown in the following examples:

descriptions of Arabic sounds. The descriptions given here are for standard MSA
pronunciation. Some sounds have allophones, or contextual variations, as noted.5
3.1 Phonemic chart of MSA consonants
3.2 Description of Arabic consonants
These descriptions are both technical and nontechnical, with examples relating
to English sounds wherever possible.6
1
hamza (√) (A) 
voiceless glottal stop: like the catch in the voice between
the syllables of “oh-oh”;7
2
baa√(b) (Ü)
voiced bilabial stop; /b/ as in “big”;
3
taa√(t) (ä)
voiceless alveolar stop; /t/ as in “tin”;
5 Colloquial regional variants, such as the pronunciation of /j/ as /y/ in the Arab Gulf region, or /k/
plus front vowel as /ch/ in Iraqi colloquial, are not provided here because they are nonstandard for
formal pronunciation of MSA.
6 For an in-depth, traditional account of Arabic phonetics, see Gairdner 1925. For technical analyses
of Arabic phonology and its history, see Al-Ani 1970 and Semaan 1968.
7 As Gairdner points out, another good example of this in English would be the hiatus prefixed to
the stressed word “our” in the sentence “It wasn’t our fault” (1925, 30).

14
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
4 thaa√(th) (ç)
voiceless interdental fricative; // or /th/ as in “thin”;8
5  jiim (j) (ê)
There are three standard regional variants:
(a) voiced alveopalatal affricate; / j/ as in “jump”; 
(b) voiced alveopalatal fricative (zh): as the /z/ in “azure”
or the medial sound in “pleasure”;
(c) voiced velar stop; /g / as in “goat”;9
6 Haa√(H) (ì)
voiceless pharyngeal fricative; a sound produced deep in
the throat using the muscles involved in swallowing.
Constrict these muscles while at the same time pushing
breath through – as though you were trying to stage-
whisper “Hey!”10
7 xaa√(x) (ñ)
voiceless velar fricative; like the /ch/ in Bach or Scottish 
loch; in some romanization systems it is represented by
/kh/;
8 daal (d) (O)
voiced alveolar stop; /d/ as in “door”;
9 dhaal (dh) (P)
voiced interdental fricative: /D/ or /dh/ pronounced like
the /th/ in “this”;
10
raa√(r) (Q) 
voiced alveolar flap or trill: as /r/ in Italian or Spanish; a
good example in English is to pronounce the word “very”
as “veddy”;
11 zaay (z) (R)
voiced alveolar fricative: /z /as in zip;
12 siin (s) (¢S)
voiceless alveolar fricative: /s/ as in sang; 
13 shiin (sh) (¢T) 
voiceless palatal fricative: /sh/ as in ship;
14 Saad (S) (¢U)
voiceless velarized alveolar fricative: /s/ but pronounced 
farther back in the mouth, with a raised and tensed 
tongue;
15 Daad (D) (¢V) 
voiced velarized alveolar stop: /d/ but pronounced 
farther back in the mouth, with a raised and tensed 
tongue;
16 Taa√(T) (•)
voiceless velarized alveolar stop: /t/ pronounced farther
back in the mouth, with a raised and tensed tongue;
8 Arabic has two different symbols for the two phonemes or different kinds of “th” in English - the
voiceless, as in “think” (often transcribed as // ) and the voiced interdental as in “them” (often
transcribed as / D /). Thaa√/ç/ is the voiceless one whereas dhaal /P/ is voiced. In this text, the
voiceless version // is romanized as /th/, and the voiced / D / as /dh/.
9 The variations are essentially as follows: the first is more characteristic of the Arabian Peninsula
and Iraq, the second more Levantine and North African, and the third specifically Egyptian and
Sudanese pronunciation. Occasionally, a mixed pronunciation of jiim is found, with one variant
alternating with another, especially /j/ and /zh/.
10 The nature of the pharyngeal consonants Haa√and ﬁayn is described in detail in McCarus and
Rammuny 1974, 124–34 and in Gairdner 1925, 27–29.

Phonology and script
15
17 Zaa√(Z) (®)
There are two standard variants of this phoneme:
(a) voiced velarized interdental fricative: /dh/ as in 
“this” pronounced farther back in the mouth, with a 
raised and tensed tongue; 
(b) voiced velarized alveolar fricative: /z/ pronounced 
farther back in the mouth with a raised and tense 
tongue;11
18 
cayn ( c ) (´)
voiced pharyngeal fricative: this is a “strangled” sound 
that comes from deep in the throat, using the muscles 
used in swallowing;12
19 ghayn (gh) (Æ)
voiced velar fricative: a “gargled” sound, much like 
French /r/;
20
faa√(f ) (±)
voiceless labiodental fricative: as /f / in “fine”;
21 qaaf (q) (¥)
voiceless uvular stop: this is made by “clicking” the 
back of the tongue against the very back of the mouth,  
where the uvula is;
22 kaaf (k) (∑)
voiceless velar stop: /k/ as in “king”;
23 laam (l) (∫)
voiced lateral: this has two pronunciations:
(a) /l/as in “well” or “full” (back or “dark” /l/ );13
(b) /l/as in “lift” or “leaf” (fronted or “light” /l/ );14
24 miim (m) (Ω)
voiced bilabial continuant: /m/ as in “moon”;
25 nuun (n) (¿)
voiced nasal continuant: /n/ as in “noon”;
26 haa√(h) (√)
voiceless glottal fricative: /h/ as in “hat”;
27 waaw (w) or (uu)(h)
bilabial semivowel: /w/ as in “wind” or long vowel 
/uu/ pronounced like the “oo” in “food”;
28 yaa√(y) or (ii) (…) 
palatal semivowel: /y/ as in “yes” or long vowel /ii/ 
pronounced like the long /i/ in “machine.”15
The notation of Arabic consonants and their use in orthography is quite
straightforward, except for the following considerations, which are described in
detail: the orthography and pronunciation of the letter hamza, the spelling and
pronunciation variants of the the taa√marbuuTa, and the doubling of consonant
11 Pronunciation of Dhaa / Zaa√varies regionally; the interdental and alveolar fricatives are the most
widely accepted.
12 See note 10.
13 Technically, this variant of /l/ is velarized. The tongue is raised in the back of the mouth. Although
primarily an allophonic variant, for a theory of its status as a separate phoneme in Arabic, see
Ferguson 1956.
14 This variant of /l/ is more fronted and palatalized even than the light /l/ in English and is closer to
French /l/ as in “belle.” See Gairdner 1925, 17–19 for discussion of “dark” and “light” /l/.

elsewhere in the Arab world, it receives its two dots at all times and in all positions.

strength (gemination). The nature of the approximants (semivowels) waaw and
yaa√is also discussed at greater length under the section on vowels.
3.3 hamza rules: orthography and pronunciation
There are two kinds of hamza, strong and weak. Strong hamza is a regular conso-
nant and is pronounced under all circumstances, whether in initial, medial, or
final position in a word. Weak hamza or “elidable” hamza is a phonetic device that
helps pronunciation of consonant clusters and only occurs at the beginning of a
word. It is often deleted in context.
3.3.1 Strong hamza (hamzat al-qaTﬁ™r£n≤rdG Inõrªng):
The Arabic letter hamza (√) is often written with what is termed a “seat,” or “chair”
(kursii »°Srôoc in Arabic), but sometimes the hamza sits aloof, by itself. There is a set
of rules to determine which chair, if any, hamza will take, depending on its posi-
tion within a word, as follows:
3.3.1.1 CHAIR RULES
(1)
The chairs used for hamza are identical with the letters for long vowels: √alif,
waaw, and yaa√. When yaa√is used as a seat for hamza, it loses its two dots.
(2)
When used as chairs, the long vowels are not pronounced. They appear in
the script only as seats for the hamza, not as independent sounds.
(3)
The choice of which chair to use (√alif, waaw, or yaa√) is determined by two
things: position of the hamza in the word and/or the nature of the vowels
immediately adjacent to hamza.
3.3.1.2 INITIAL hamza CHAIR RULES: When hamza is the initial consonant in a word,
it has an √alif seat. When the vowel with hamza is a fatHa or Damma, the hamza is
written on top of the √alif, and when the vowel with the hamza is kasra, the hamza
is usually written under the √alif.16 Note that the vowel after hamza can be a short
or a long one. In written Arabic, hamza in initial position is usually invisible,
along with its short vowel. Here it is provided.

17
3.3.1.3 MEDIAL hamza When hamza occurs in the middle of a word, it normally
has a seat determined by the nature of its adjacent vowels. The vowel sounds
contiguous to hamza, on either side, whether short or long, have a firm order of
priority in determining the seat for hamza. That order is: i-u-a. That is, the first
priority in seat-determination is an /i/, /ii/, or /y/ sound, which will give hamza a
yaa√seat (yaa√without dots). In the absence of an /i/ sound, an /u/ or /uu/ sound
gives hamza a waaw seat, and this has second priority. If there is no /i/ or /u/ sound,
an /a/ or /aa/ gives hamza an √alif seat, and this has the lowest priority. This system
is easier to understand with examples:

Medial aloof hamza: When hamza occurs medially after waaw as long vowel
/uu/, or after √alif followed by an /a/ sound, it sits aloof. In general, Arabic
script avoids having two adjacent √alifs.

3.3.1.4 FINAL hamza: When hamza is the final letter of a word, it can either sit
aloof or have a seat.
(1)
Aloof: Hamza sits aloof at the end of a word when it is preceded by a long
vowel:
calmness

(2)
On a seat: Final hamza sits on a seat when it is preceded by a short vowel.
The nature of the short vowel determines which seat hamza will have. A
fatHa gives it an √alif seat, a kasra gives it a yaa√(without dots) seat, and a
Damma gives it a waaw seat.

Shift of seat with suffixes: It is important to note that word-final hamza may
shift to medial hamza if the word gets a suffix and hamza is no longer the final
consonant. Suffixes such as possessive pronouns (on nouns) and verb inflec-
tions cause this to happen. Short vowel suffixes (case and mood-markers) nor-
mally do not influence the writing of hamza. Here are some examples:

3.3.2 hamza plus long /aa/ madda
A special symbol stands for hamza followed by a long /aa/ sound: /√aa/. The symbol
is called madda (‘extension’) and looks like this: BG . It is always written above √alif
and is sometimes referred to as √alif madda. It can occur at the beginning of a
word, in the middle, or at the end. Even if it occurs at the beginning of a word, the
madda notation is visible, unlike the regular initial hamza.

3.3.3 Weak hamza (hamzat al-waSI π°UƒdG Iõªg)
Hamzat al-waSl, elidable hamza, is a phonetic device affixed to the beginning of a
word for ease of pronunciation. It is used only in initial position, and is accompa-
nied by a short vowel: /i/, /u/, or /a/.18 For purposes of phonology and spelling it is nec-
essary to know whether an initial hamza is a strong one or an elidable one, since
elidable hamza drops out in pronunciation unless it is utterance-initial. When elid-
able hamza drops out, its √alif seat remains in spelling, but it gets a different symbol
on top of it, called a waSla, which indicates deletion of the glottal stop and liaison
between the previous vowel and the following consonant.19 If a word starting with
17 It is the style in certain Arab countries to write even the third person masculine plural with hamza
sitting on √alif, e.g., qara√uu GhCGnônb. Either way is correct.
18 It is a phonological rule that no word may start with a consonant cluster in Arabic, but certain
morphological processes result in patterns or groupings of affixes that cause consonant clusters.
19 The technical term for this process is aphaeresis or aphesis, deletion of an initial vowel of a word
and substituting for it the final vowel of the previous word, as the deletion of the initial “a” in
“are” in the contraction “we’re” or the initial “i” of “is” in “she’s.”

20
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
elidable hamza is preceded by a consonant, a “helping vowel” is affixed to the con-
sonant in order to facilitate pronunciation. Neither hamzat al-waSl nor waSla are vis-
ible in ordinary text.
In the transcription system used in this text, words that start with initial
hamzat al-waSl do not have the transliterated hamza symbol (√). The main cate-
gories of words that begin with hamzat al-waSl are as follows:
3.3.3.1 DEFINITE ARTICLE, al- `dG:  The short vowel that accompanies elidable hamza
of the definite article is fatHa.

3.4 taa√marbuuTa (ánWƒHrône  AÉJ)
3.4.1 Spelling
The taa√marbuuTa is a spelling variant of regular taa√. It occurs only in word-
final position on nouns and adjectives. It is not an optional variant, but deter-
mined by word meaning and morphology. In shape, it looks like a haa√with two
dots over it.

3.4.2 Meaning and use
In most cases, taa√marbuuTa is a marker of feminine gender. For example, an
Arabic word that refers to a person’s occupation may be either masculine or
feminine, depending on whether one is referring to a man or woman (i.e., engi-
neer, teacher, doctor, student). The masculine singular is a base or unmarked
form, and the feminine singular is marked by the presence of a taa√marbuuTa.

Some nouns, however, are inherently feminine in gender and always spelled
with taa√marbuuTa. For example:

In addition to showing feminine gender on nouns, taa√marbuuTa also shows
feminine gender on adjectives:

3.4.3 Pronunciation
In pronunciation, taa√marbuuTa sometimes has the haa√sound and other times,
taa√, so that it is a combination of taa√and haa√in terms of its written shape and
its pronunciation. One consistent feature of taa√marbuuTa is that it is always pre-
ceded by an /a/ sound, usually short /a/ (fatHa), but sometimes, long /aa/ (√alif).

3.4.3.2 PAUSE FORM PRONUNCIATION: In pause form, the final inflectional vowel
is not pronounced, and, usually, neither is the taa√marbuuTa. In most pause form
situations, the pronunciation of taa√marbuuTa becomes haa√. Because a final /h/
sound is hard to hear, it sounds as though the word is pronounced only with a
final /a/, the fatHa that precedes the taa√marbuuTa.20

3.5 Consonant doubling (gemination): tashdiid ójór°ûnJ
Sometimes consonants are doubled in Arabic. This is both a spelling and pronunci-
ation feature and means that the consonants are pronounced with double strength
or emphasis.21 The technical term for this kind of doubling is “gemination.” In Ara-
bic, the doubling process is called tashdiid, and instead of writing the letter twice,
Arabic has a diacritical symbol that is written above the doubled consonant which
shows that it is pronounced with twice the emphasis. The name of the symbol is
shadda (‘intensification’), and it looks like this: q . Like the short vowels, shadda does
not normally appear in written text, but it is necessary to know that it is there. Here
are some examples of words that include doubled or geminated consonants:

3.5.1 Reasons for gemination
Gemination can result from a lexical root that contains a doubled root consonant
(such as the root H-b-b for Hubb, ‘love’), or it can result from a derivational process,
that is, it can change word meaning and create words. For example, the verb stem
daras means ‘to study,’ but a derived form of that verb, darras, with doubled raa√,
means ‘to teach.’ The meanings are related, but not the same.
Gemination can also be the result of assimilation, the absorption of one sound
into another. In these cases, the process is phonetic and not phonemic, i.e., it is a
21 In English, the spelling of a word with a double consonant does not indicate that the
pronunciation of that consonant is stronger (e.g., kitten, ladder, offer). However, when an identical
consonant is pronounced across word boundaries, it is pronounced more strongly. For example, in
the following phrases, the last letter of the first word and the first letter of the last word combine
together and result in stronger pronunciation: “shelf-full,” “good deed,” “hot tea,” or “still life.”
This kind of consonant strengthening resembles the process of gemination in Arabic.

Phonology and script
25
rule of pronunciation and does not affect the meaning of a word. For example, the
/l/ of the definite article /al-/ is assimilated to certain consonants when they begin
words (e.g., al-daftar, ‘the notebook,’ is pronounced ad-daftar).22
4 Vowels
The Modern Standard Arabic sound system has six vowel phonemes: three “long”
ones and three “short”: / ii/ and /i/, /uu/ and /u/, /aa/ and /a/. The difference in length
is not a difference in vowel quality, but in the length of time that the vowel is
held. The distinction between short and long is similar to difference in length in
musical notation, where there are quarter notes, half notes, and whole notes,
each one held twice as long as the other. It is possible to think of short vowels as
resembling quarter notes and long vowels as half notes, the long vowels being
held approximately double the length of time of the short vowels. Long vowels are
represented in the Arabic alphabet by the letters √alif (aa), waaw (uu) and yaa√(ii).
They are written into words as part of the words’ spelling. Short vowels, on the
other hand, are not independent letters and are written only as diacritical marks
above and below the body of the word. In actual practice, short vowels are not
indicated in written Arabic text; they are invisible. 
The pronunciation of vowels, especially /aa/ and /a/, varies over a rather wide
range, depending on word structure and the influence of adjacent consonants,
but also on regional variations in pronunciation. Moreover, the letter √alif has sev-
eral different spelling variants and the letters waaw and yaa√function both as
vowels and as consonants.

4.2.1.1 PRONUNCIATION: The letter √alif represents a long /aa/ sound. The quality
of this sound varies from being fronted (as in the English word “fad”), a low
22 See section 8.1 on the definite article in this chapter.

Usually, in order to have the central or backed pronunciation, the word has a
back consonant, either a velarized one (S, D, T, or Z) or a qaaf, as the ones above
illustrate. The backed pronunciation is also used when √alif is followed immedi-
ately by raa√(as in the words manaara, naar, and jaar). However, in certain parts of
the Arab world, especially the Eastern regions (such as Iraq), the backed pronun-
ciation is more frequent.
4.2.1.2 SPELLING VARIANTS OF √alif. There are three variations of the letter √alif:
√alif qaSiira (‘dagger’ √alif ), √alif maqSuura (‘shortened’ √alif ) and regular √alif (√alif
Tawiila – ‘tall’ √alif). These variants are not optional but are determined by
derivational etymology and spelling conventions.
4.2.1.3 √alif Tawiila án∏jƒnW ∞pdnCG. This is the standard form of √alif. It is a non-
connecting letter written into the word:
(1)
√alif Tawiila in initial position: In initial position, √alif is not a vowel; it is
always a seat for hamza (accompanied by a short vowel) or madda (hamza
plus long /aa/).

The letter √alif has a special relationship with a preceding laam: it sits inside
the curve of the laam at an angle. This special combination of letters is
called a “ligature,” and is even occasionally cited as part of the alphabet
(“laam-√alif”).

(3.2)
√alif Tawiila with nunation: A word-final √alif may be written with two fatHas
above it, signaling that the word is nunated, that is, marked for indefinite
accusative case (and pronounced -an). In this case, the √alif is not pronounced;
it is only a seat or “chair” for the two fatHas that mark the indefinite accusa-
tive. The accusative case often indicates that a noun is an object of a transi-
tive verb, or it may mark an adverbial function. For further description and
examples of the accusative, see Chapter 7 on noun inflections. Some exam-
ples of adverbial accusatives ending with √alif plus nunation include:

silent inflectional √alif Tawiila: The √alif Tawiila is written as part of the
third person masculine plural past tense inflection, but it is only a
spelling convention and it is not pronounced. If a pronoun suffix is added
to this verb inflection, then the silent √alif is deleted:23

4.2.1.4 “DAGGER” √alif: √alif qasiira InÒ°ünb ∞pdnCG:  This form of √alif is a spelling
convention used only with certain words. It is a reduced version of √alif Tawiila
written above the consonant (hanging above it rather like a dagger), rather than
beside it in the body of the word. As with the short vowels written above or below
the word, this form of √alif is not normally visible in ordinary text. It is therefore
necessary to know that a word is spelled with √alif qaSiira in order to pronounce it
correctly. The words spelled with √alif qaSiira are not many in number, but some
of them are used with great frequency. The most common ones include:

4.1.2.4 √alif maqSuura IQƒ°ü≤e ∞dCG: The √alif maqSuura looks like a yaa√without
dots. This form of √alif occurs only at the end of a word. It is a spelling convention
occurring with certain words because of their derivational etymology. Sometimes
a dagger √alif is added above the √alif maqSuura to distinguish it from a final yaa√.
Some words spelled with √alif maqSuura are proper names, such as:
Leila
laylaa
≈∏r«nd
Moses
muusaa
≈°Sƒe
Mona
munaa
≈æoe
Mustafa
muSTafaa
≈Ø£°üe
23 This √alif is called √alif al-faaSila or “separating √alif.” It is also sometimes referred to as “otiose
√alif.”

29
Other words ending in √alif maqSuura may be any form class: verb, preposition,
noun, adjective:

taqwaa
iƒr≤nJ
upon
ﬁalaa
≈∏nY
greatest (f.)
kubraa

√ilaa
¤pEG
Sometimes, in an indefinite noun or adjective, the √alif maqSuura is a seat for
the indefinite accusative marker, fatHataan, and the word is pronounced with an
/-an / ending instead of -aa. This depends on the word’s etymology. For declension
and more examples of these words, see Chapter 7 on noun inflections.

4.2.2 Semivowels/semi-consonants waaw and yaa√
The letters waaw and yaa√have two functions. They represent the consonant
sounds /w/ and /y/, respectively, and they also represent the long vowels /uu/ and
/ii/. English has something similar to this because the letter “y” can act as a con-
sonant, as in the word “yellow” or it can act as a vowel, as in the word “sky.”26 The
Arabic /ii/ sound symbolized by yaa√is like the /i/ in English “machine.” The /uu/
sound symbolized by waaw is like the /u/ in “rule.”
24 For rules and full paradigms of these prepositions, see Chapter 16 on prepositions and
prepositional phrases.
25 This particle also has the sense of possession: ‘she has.’
26 See note 1.

30
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
4.2.2.1 THE SOUNDS OF waaw: The letter waaw represents either the sound of
/ w/ or the long vowel /uu/. For example, in the following words, it is /w/:
boy
walad
óndnh
state
wilaaya
ánj’ph
season
mawsim
ºp°Srƒne

mamnuuﬁ
´ƒærªne
4.2.2.2 THE SOUNDS OF yaa√: The letter yaa√represents either the sound of /y/ as
in “young” or the long vowel /ii/ as the “i” in “petite.” For example, in the
following words it is /y/:
Yemen
yaman
ønªnj

4.3 Short vowels and sukuun (al-Harakaat wa l-sukuun ¿ƒµq°ùdGnh äÉcnônërdG)
The set of three short vowels consists of the sounds /a/,/ i/, and /u/. They are not
considered part of the Arabic alphabet and are not as a rule visible in written Ara-
bic. The short vowels are referred to in Arabic not as letters (Huruuf ) but as
“movements” (Harakaat). That is, they are seen as a way of moving the voice from
one consonant to another.
Short vowels can be written into a text, but ordinarily they are not. Two excep-
tions to this are the Qur√ân and children’s schoolbooks. In the Qur√ân, the short
vowels are made explicit so that readers and reciters can be absolutely certain of
the correct pronunciation of the sacred text. In schoolbooks, they are inserted so
that children can study and master word structure and spelling as they learn how
to read MSA. As reading skill progresses, the use of short vowels in pedagogical
texts is phased out. This is done because the patterning of short vowels is largely
predictable and therefore marking them is considered redundant.
For learners of Arabic as a foreign language, the absence of short vowels
requires extra attention to word structure and morphological patterning, and

Phonology and script
31
memorization of the exact sound of the word as well as its spelling. Just because
the vowels are invisible doesn’t mean they don’t exist.
4.3.1 fatHa: ánëràna short /a/
The short vowel /a/, called fatHa, ranges in pronunciation from low central (as in
“dark”) to lowered mid front (as in “best”), depending on context. The short vowel
/a/ is represented, when written, by a small diagonal mark sloping downward to
the left ( n ). It is placed above the consonant that it follows in pronunciation.
Examples:
country
balad
ón∏nH
she danced
raqaSat
rân°ünbnQ
mint
naﬁnaﬁ
™nær©nf
4.3.2 kasra : Inôr°ùnc short /i/
The short vowel /i/, called kasra, ranges in pronunciation from a high front vowel
(as in “petite”) to a lower front vowel (as in “sit”). Kasra is represented by a mark
similar to fatHa, but is written underneath the consonant it follows ( p ). Examples:
pepper
filfil
πpØr∏pa
skin
jild
ór∏pL
apricots
mishmish
¢ûpªr°ûpe
4.3.3 Damma: ásª°V short /u/
The short /u/ sound in Arabic, called Damma, ranges from a high back vowel (as in
“duke”) to a lower rounded back vowel (as in “bull”). The Damma is represented by
what looks like a small waaw, or an English apostrophe (o ). It is written above the
consonant which it follows. Examples:
cities
mudun
¿oóoe
ear
√udhun
¿oPoCG
quarter
rubﬁ
™rHoQ
4.3.4 Absence of vowel: sukuun ¿ƒµo°S
A consonant is not always followed by a vowel. Sometimes one consonant comes
immediately after another, or a consonant will end a word. In order to indicate
clearly that a consonant is not followed by a vowel, Arabic uses a diacritical mark
called a sukuun (‘silence’) which looks like a mini-zero (r )placed directly above the
consonant.

32
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
As with the short vowel indicators, the sukuun is invisible in ordinary script. It
is shown here in the following examples:
room
ghurfa
ánarôoZ
we drink
nashrab
Ünôr°ûnf
temple
maﬁbad
ónÑr©ne
sand

4.3.5 Extra short or helping vowels
An epenthetic or helping vowel may be inserted at the end of a word in con-
text in order to prevent consonant clusters and facilitate smoothness of pro-
nunciation within a sentence. In a sentence, these helping vowels are added
to words that would otherwise end with sukuun when the following word
begins with a consonant cluster. The determination of the helping vowel is as
follows:
4.3.5.1 HELPING VOWEL kasra: The short vowel kasra is by far the most frequent
helping vowel.

4.3.5.3 LONG VOWEL waaw AS HELPING VOWEL: A special case of a long helping
vowel /uu/ occurs when the object of the verb following the second person masculine
plural past tense suffix /-tum/ happens to be a pronoun. A long /uu/ is inserted as a
buffer between the subject marker on the verb and the object pronoun:
? Égƒ`“rôn°ûnf πng
hal nashar-tum-uu-haa?
Did you (m. pl.) publish it?
4.3.5.4 HELPING VOWEL fatHa: The short vowel fatHa has restricted use as a
helping vowel. With the word min ‘from,’ the helping vowel is fatHa before the
definite article and otherwise, kasra.

Diphthongs or glides in Arabic are combinations of short vowels and semivowels.
The sequences that occur are /aw/, /ay/, /iy/, and /uw/. The sequences */iw/ and */uy/
are usually prohibited.

Glides are vowel–consonant combinations where the vowel and consonant have
very close points of articulation, such as /iy/ (high front vowel plus palatal sonant)

5 MSA pronunciation styles: full form and pause form
When reading MSA formally, aloud, words are pronounced according to certain
rules. 
5.1 Full form
When complete voweling is observed, all vowels are pronounced, including all
the short vowels that are contained in the words but not visible in the text. This
also includes any word-final inflectional vowels and is called “full” form pronun-
ciation.
.p¢ùrenCG nán∏r«nd  pánªp°UÉ©rdG ¤pEG pásjpQƒ¡rªoérdG o¢ù«FnQ nôn°†nM
HaDar-a ra√iis-u l-jumhuuriyyat-i √ilaa l-ﬁaaSimat-i laylat-a √ams-i.
The president of the republic came to the capital last night.
5.2 Pause form
There is also a standard Arabic pronunciation principle that a word-final short
vowel may be left unpronounced. This is called “pause form” in English and waqf
∞rbnh (‘stopping’) in Arabic. There are two variants of this principle:
5.2.1 Formal pause form
When reading MSA aloud, the standard practice is to use pause form on the final
word of a sentence, or (if it is a long sentence) wherever there is a natural “pause”
for breath.

5.2.2 Informal pause form:
When reading MSA aloud or when speaking MSA less formally, pause form is
sometimes used on most or all words ending with a short vowel.

5.2.2.1 PAUSE FORM FOR WORDS ENDING IN taa√marbuuTa: A word that ter-
minates in taa√marbuuTa is usually pronounced as ending in -a or -ah in pause form
unless it is the first term of an √iDaafa, in which case it is pronounced as a /-t-/ sound.

6 MSA syllable structure
There are a limited number of possible syllable sequences for MSA word structure. 
First of all, no word or syllable may start with a vowel. If a word appears to start
with a vowel, such as √islaam or √umma or √abadan, what is actually heard is a
vowel preceded by a glottal stop (hamza). English speakers tend not to hear the
glottal stop because it is not phonemic (meaningful) in English. It is, however, a
real consonant in Arabic.

√anaa
ÉfnCG

31 Final short vowel /-i/ is unpronounced.
32 Note that in order to avoid consonant clusters and ease pronunciation, when speaking in pause
form, sometimes helping vowels have to be inserted.
33 For a more detailed description of taa√marbuuTa pronunciation, see McCarus and Rammuny 1974,
112–13. See also section 1.2 of Chapter 7, on feminine gender marking.

36
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
The second rule is that no word or syllable may begin with a consonant cluster,
such as /sk/ or /br/. Consonant clusters within syllables are prohibited, except for
one situation: In pause form, a word may end in a consonant cluster, such as:
fahimt ‘I understood’ ârªp¡na or istaﬁmalt ‘I used’ âr∏nªr©nàr°SpG. Syllable structure in MSA
is therefore limited to the following five combinations of consonants and vowels. 
6.1 Full form pronunciation syllables
(1)
“Short” or “weak” syllable: CV (consonant–short vowel)
e.g., -ma, -bi, -hu
(2)
“Long” or “strong” syllables: CVV (consonant–long vowel)
or CVC (consonant–short vowel–consonant)
e.g., -faa, -dii, -ras, -tab
6.2 Additional pause form pronunciation syllables
(1)
“Super-strong” syllables: CVVC (consonant–long vowel–consonant)
or CVCC (consonant–short vowel–consonant–consonant)
e.g., -riim, -nuun, -sart, -rabt
These super-strong sequences occur primarily in word-final position.34
7 Word stress rules
Stress rules refer to the placement of stress or emphasis (loudness) within a word.
In English, stress is not fully predictable and is learned by ear or along with word
spelling. Some words in English are differentiated only by stress, for example:
invalid (noun and adjective), present (noun, adjective, and verb), suspect (noun
and verb), conduct (noun and verb). 
Stress in Modern Standard Arabic, on the other hand, is essentially predictable
and adheres to some general rules based on syllable structure. Because MSA is not
a spontaneously spoken language, the rules given here for stress patterns are for
the way MSA is pronounced when read out loud or used in speaking from pre-
pared texts in the Eastern Arab world. In Egypt and the Sudan, stress rules are
different for MSA as well as the colloquial language. Nonetheless, the standard
Eastern form is “a nearly universal norm,” acceptable and understandable
throughout the Arab world.35
34 Active participles of geminate Form I verbs contain an internal CVVC sequence, for example, qêÉM
Haajj ‘pilgrim,’ IsOÉe maadda, ‘substance,’ ásaÉc kaaffa ‘entirety,’ qΩÉ°S saamm ‘poisonous,’ q±ÉL jaaff ‘dry,’
qΩÉY ‘aamm ‘public; general,’ q¢UÉN xaaSS ‘private; special,’ or qQÉM Haarr ‘hot.’ Some borrowed words
also contain this sequence, such as raad-yuu ƒjOGQ ‘radio.’ See Chapter 6 on participles, section 1.1.2.
35 McCarthy and Prince 1990a, 252. They also note that “there is inconsistency in the stressing of
standard Arabic words between different areas of the Arab world, and no direct testimony on this
subject exists from the Classical period.”

Phonology and script
37
Different sets of rules are used for full form pronunciation and pause form pro-
nunciation. They overlap to a great extent, but there are some differences. The
major feature of all these stress rules is that stress placement is calculated from
the end of a word – not the beginning. Note that some Arabic words are composed
of several morphological elements, including case endings and pronoun suffixes
of various sorts, so that the length of words may vary substantially.
7.1 Full form stress rules
7.1.1 Stress is never on the ﬁnal syllable
Therefore, in words of two syllables, stress is on the first, no matter what that first
syllable is like (strong or weak). Examples (stress is indicated by boldface):
to, towards
√ilaa
¤pEG

naHnu
oørënf
what
maadhaa
GPÉe

zaaruu
GhQGR
she
hiya
n»pg
here
hunaa
Éæog
7.1.2 Stress on penult
Stress is on the second syllable from the end of the word (the penult) if that sylla-
ble is strong (CVC or CVV). Examples:
efforts (nom.)
juhuudun
lOƒ¡oL
students (acc.)
Tullaaban

Égƒ°SsQnO

nørÑoàrµnj

ﬁamiltum
ºoàr∏pªnY
7.1.3 Stress on the antepenult
If the second syllable from the end of the word is weak (CV), then the stress falls
back to the third syllable from the end (the antepenult):
a capital

lánªp°UÉY

38
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
7.1.4 Summary: word length
Therefore, in full-form pronunciation, MSA stress falls either on the second or
third syllable from the end of the word. Note that if a suffix is attached to a word,
it increases the number of syllables and may change the stress pattern, e.g.,
university
jaamiﬁatun
lán©peÉL

7.2 Pause form stress rule
The same basic set of rules applies to pause form, but there is an important addi-
tional rule for pause form pronunciation: Stress falls on the final syllable of a
word if that syllable is a super-strong one (CVCC or CVVC).

7.2.1 Summary
To summarize, MSA stress falls on either the second or the third syllable from the
end of the word or, in pause form, on the final syllable if it is super-strong.36 
7.2.2 Other pause form conventions
7.2.2.1 PAUSE FORM nisba: Words in pause form that end with the nisba (relative
adjective) suffix -iyy should technically have stress placed on that final syllable
(CVCC), e.g.,
Yemeni
yamaniyy
q»ænªnj
official
ra√iisiyy
q»°ù«FnQ
Arab
ﬁarabiyy
q»HnônY
Bedouin
badawiyy
q…hnónH
And this is done in very formal spoken MSA. However, it is often the case in spo-
ken MSA (as in colloquial Arabic) that this ending is treated not as -iyy but simply
36 As McCarthy and Prince concisely note: “The stress system is obviously weight-sensitive: final
syllables are stressed if superheavy CvvC or CvCC; penults are stressed if heavy Cvv or CvC;
otherwise the antepenult is stressed” (1990a, 252).

Phonology and script
39
as long ii, in which case the stress is placed as though the last syllable contained
an open long vowel:
Yemeni
yamanii
»ænªnj
official
ra√iisii
»°ù«FnQ
Arab
ﬁarabii
»HnônY
Bedouin
badawii
…hnónH
7.2.2.2 PAUSE FORM CHANGE IN STRESS FOR CERTAIN WORDS SPELLED WITH taa√
marbuuTa: In pause form, taa√marbuuTa, along with its case ending, is not
pronounced, and this eliminates a syllable from the word. Therefore, stress has to
be recalculated, and certain words spelled with taa√marbuuTa shift the stress when
pronounced in pause form.
37 For additional reading on Arabic word stress and generative phonology, see Brame 1970 and Abdo
1969.

The shift in stress in the above examples occurs because when the taa√marbuuTa
plus case ending is deleted, the third syllable from the end becomes the second
syllable from the end, and because it is weak (CV), it cannot receive the stress, so
the stress shifts back to the previous syllable. There are also cases where the dele-
tion of taa√marbuuTa plus case ending does not alter the stress pattern. This hap-
pens if the syllable that originally had the stress is a strong syllable. In this case
the strong syllable retains the stress, in keeping with the general rules.37

8 Deﬁniteness and indeﬁniteness markers
8.1 Deﬁnite article al- `dG
8.1.1 Spelling
The definite article in Arabic is spelled with √alif-laam and is attached as a prefix.
This spelling convention makes a word with the prefixed definite article look like
just one word. The definite article thus never occurs independently ( al- `dG ). It is a
proclitic particle, i.e., always attached to a word – either a noun or an adjective.

AÉ°ùpqædG
8.1.2 Pronunciation
In general, the definite article is pronounced “al” but many speakers shorten the
/a/ sound so that it sounds more like “el” (as in English “elbow”). It is spelled with
elidable hamza (hamzat al-waSl) (see above), so if the definite article is not utterance-
initial, the hamza drops out in pronunciation and the vowel pronounced with the
laam of the definite article is actually the final vowel of the preceding word (see
also above under hamzat al-waSl).
8.1.2.1 SUN AND MOON LETTERS
(1)
Sun Letters (Huruuf shamsiyya ás«p°ùrªn°T ±hôoM): Certain sounds assimilate or
absorb the sound of the laam in the definite article. These sounds or letters
are called “sun letters” (Huruuf shamsiyya). When a word begins with one of
these sounds, the √alif-laam of the definite article is written, but the laam is
not pronounced; instead, it is absorbed or assimilated into the first letter or
sound in the word and that letter is doubled in strength. A shadda is written
over the sun letter itself to show that the /l/ is assimilated into it and strength-
ens it, but the shadda does not show in normal printed Arabic.
The sun letters or sounds that absorb the /l/ of the definite article are as follows:
¿  ∫  ®  •  ¢V   ¢U  ¢T  ¢S  R  Q  P  O  ç  ä

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
8.1.2.2 SUMMARY: SUN AND MOON LETTERS: The Arabic alphabet, or inventory of
consonant sounds, is therefore divided into two groups: sounds that assimilate
the /l/ of the definite article and sounds that do not. The sounds are best learned
through memorization, listening, and speaking practice. Note that in many
transliteration systems (Library of Congress, for example), when written Arabic is
romanized into Latin letters, the definite article is spelled “al” even though in
pronunciation the /l/ may be assimilated. That is the case in the romanization in
this text.
8.2 Indeﬁnite marker: nunation (tanwiin øjƒrænJ)
Indefiniteness, which corresponds to the use of “a” or “an” in English, is not
marked with a separate word in Arabic. Instead, it is marked with a suffix, an /n/
sound that comes at the end of a word. This /n/ sound is not written with a regu-
lar letter /nuun/. It is indicated by writing the final inflectional vowel on a word
twice. In the case of Damma, nunation is often indicated by giving the Damma a
“tail” or flourish at the end, rather than doubling it.38

38 The writing conventions for this indefinite marking are described in detail in Chapter 7, 
section 4.2.1.

Nunation as a marker of indefiniteness may appear on nouns, adjectives, and
adverbs. Certain classes of words (e.g., diptotes) are restricted from having
nunation.

lâr«nH
a house (genitive)
bayt-i-n
mâr«nH

Note that the accusative form of nunation often needs a “seat” or “chair” which
is usually √alif Tawiila.39 For example:
place
makaan-an
kÉfÉµne
bridge
jisr-an
kGôr°ùpL
many
kathiir-an
kGÒãnc
In words spelled with taa√marbuuTa, the nunation sits atop the final letter and
the accusative nunation does not require an √alif chair. This is also the case in
words that end with hamza preceded by a long vowel.

the accusative cases, e.g., k≈æ©e maﬁnan ‘meaning’ or k≈¡≤e maqhan ‘coffeehouse.’ See section 5.4.4
of Chapter 7 for further details of this declension.

1 Morphology in general
Morphology, or word structure, pertains to the organization, rules, and processes
concerning meaningful units of language, whether they be words themselves
or parts of words, such as affixes of various sorts. Meaningful components and
subcomponents at the word level are referred to as morphemes.2 Arabic morphol-
ogy is different from English in some very basic respects but it is highly system-
atic. In fact, Arabic and the Semitic languages have had substantial influence on
the development of certain key concepts in theoretical morphology.3
Theories of word structure, or morphology, usually focus on two essential
issues: how words are formed (derivational or lexical morphology) and how they
interact with syntax (inflectional morphology, e.g., marking for categories such
as gender, number, case, tense). Arab grammarians, starting in the late eighth and
early ninth centuries AD, developed sophisticated analyses of Arabic morphology
that differ from modern Western theories, but interrelate with them in interest-
ing ways.4 Because this reference grammar is intended primarily for the use of
Western readers, it is organized along the lines of traditional Western categories,
with inclusion of the Arabic terminology.
Derivational or lexical morphology has to do with principles governing word
formation (such as analysis of the English words “truthful” or “untruthfulness”
44
3
Arabic word structure: an overview
“The Semitic root is one of the great miracles of man’s language.”1
1 Lohmann 1972, 318.
2 Aronoff (1976, 7) gives this general definition of morphemes: “the units into which words are
analyzed and out of which they are composed.” This definition is adequate as a start, although
Aronoff notes that it is problematic in certain ways for morphological theory. For a general
introduction to traditional morphology a good place to begin is Matthews 1974. He writes: “the
morpheme is established as the single minimal or primitive unit of grammar, the ultimate basis
for our entire description of the primary articulation of language. Words, phrases, etc., are all
seen as larger, complex or non-primitive units which are built up from morphemes in successive
stages” (1974, 78). For further developments in morphological theory see Aronoff 1976 and 1994,
Anderson 1992, and Spencer 1991.
3 “It may thus well be that all Western linguistic morphology is directly rooted in the Semitic
grammatical tradition” (Aronoff 1994, 3). 
4 For discussion of how Arabic morphological categories interrelate with Western theories, see
Ryding 1993.  See also discussions in Aronoff 1994, esp. 123–64 and Anderson 1992, 57–58; Monteil
(1960, 105–223) has an excellent overview of MSA morphological issues.

Arabic word structure: an overview

derived from the base word “true”).5 Inflectional morphology describes how
words vary or inflect in order to express grammatical contrasts or categories, such
as singular/plural or past/present tense. Derivation, since it is the process of cre-
ating words or lexical units, is considered procedurally prior to inflection, which
subsequently acts upon the word stem and modifies it, if necessary, for use in con-
text (by affixing /-s/ in English for plural, for example, or /-ed/ for past tense). These
are two fundamental categories, therefore, in approaching language structure.
However, the boundaries between derivation and inflection are not as clear-cut in
Arabic as they are in English because Arabic morphology works on different
principles, and because Arabic morphological theory views elements of word
structure and sentence structure from a different perspective.6
Readers who are consulting this reference grammar for answers to specific
questions may want to skip over the morphological theory and consult the para-
digms (inflectional charts), and the book is designed to allow them to do so. How-
ever, those who are studying Arabic with goals of understanding the processes
and categories of Arabic language structure will find that descriptions of the
morphological structure are helpful not only in understanding the theoretical
framework of Arabic, but also in organizing their knowledge in order to serve as a
foundation for higher levels of achievement and proficiency. Moreover, without a
sound grasp of Arabic morphological principles, learners will be unable to make
use of Arabic dictionaries.
2 Derivation: the Arabic root-pattern system
Arabic morphology exhibits rigorous and elegant logic. It differs from that of
English or other Indo-European languages because it is to a large extent based on
discontinuous morphemes. It consists primarily of a system of consonant roots
which interlock with patterns of vowels (and sometimes certain other conso-
nants) to form words, or word stems. This type of operation is not unknown in
English. If one looks at the consonant sequence s-ng, one knows that its meaning
5 In the word “untruthfulness,” for example, there are four morphemes: un-, truth, -ful, and -ness.
Three of these morphemes are bound, i.e., they cannot occur on their own, and one (“truth”) is
“free.”
6 The two major categories of grammatical analysis in Arabic are Sarf±ô°U and naHwƒëf, which
are often translated as morphology and syntax, respectively. However, the boundary between them
is not the same boundary as in Western grammatical theory. The category of Sarf covers many
areas of derivational morphology (e.g., the ten forms of the verb) and some inflectional morphol-
ogy (e.g., the past tense paradigm); but it does not include the study of case and mood. A further
category of Arabic grammatical analysis, ishtiqaaq, is often translated as ‘etymology’ but actually
deals more with Arabic derivational morphology. It is etymology (the study of word origins and
development) in the sense that it deals extensively with the creation of words from the lexical
root system, but not in the Western diachronic sense that examines the evolution of lexical items
and their meanings over time and through different, though related stages of language evolution.

has to do with vocal music. By inserting different vowels into the vowel slot
between the /s-/ and the /-ng/ several different English words can be formed:
sing
(v.)
sang
(v.)
sung
(v.)
song
(n.)
All of these items are words, or stems that can have suffixes such as “sing-ing,”
“song-s,” “sing-s,” “song-’s,” “sing-er,” or prefixes, such as “un-sung.” As a compar-
ison, the consonant sequence s-ng corresponds roughly to the concept of an Arabic
consonantal root, whereas the vowels and affixes would correspond approxi-
mately to the Arabic concept of pattern. The procedure of differentiating mean-
ing by means of word-internal vowel change is known technically as “ablaut” or
“introflection,” defined as a word-internal change that signals a grammatical
change. Other examples in English include: man/men, foot/feet, mouse/mice,
know/knew, sink/sank/sunk. In English, the change usually involves just one
vowel; however, in Arabic, it can involve several, for example:
he wrote 
katab-a (v.)
nÖnànc 
he corresponded
kaatab-a (v.)
nÖnJÉc

kutib-a (v.)
nÖpàoc

kaatib (n.)
ÖpJÉc
writers 
kuttaab (n.)
ÜÉqàoc
write! (2 m.s.)
uktub! (v.)
!rÖoàrcoG
These words, or stems, can have inflectional suffixes such as katab-at ‘she
wrote,’ or kutub-an ‘books’ (accusative case). The root or three-consonant ordered
sequence k-t-b has to do with “writing,” and most words in the Arabic language
that have to do with writing are derived from that root, through modifying pat-
terns of vowels (and sometimes also adding certain consonants). This is a typically
Semitic morphological system. In Arabic, this root-pattern process has evolved
extensively and very productively in order to cover a vast array of meanings
associated with each semantic field (such as “writing”). A few more examples:

As seen in the above examples, the shifting of patterns around the consonantal
root accomplishes a great deal in terms of word creation (derivation) and to some
extent, word inflection (e.g., pluralization). The consonant root can be viewed as
a nucleus or core around which are constellated a wide array of potential mean-
ings, depending on which pattern is keyed into the root. Roots and patterns are
interacting components of word meaning and are both bound morphemes. They
each convey specific and essential types of meaning, but neither one can exist
independently because they are abstract mental representations.7
2.1 A deﬁnition of root
A root is a relatively invariable discontinuous bound morpheme, represented by
two to five phonemes, typically three consonants in a certain order, which
interlocks with a pattern to form a stem and which has lexical meaning.8
The root morpheme (for example, /k-t-b/ ) is “discontinuous” because vowels can
be interspersed between those consonants; however, those consonants must
always be present and be in the same sequence: first /k/, then /t/, then /b/. The
usual number of consonants in an Arabic root is three and these constitute “by far
the largest part of the language” (Haywood and Nahmad, 1962: 261). However,
there are also two-consonant (biliteral), four-consonant (quadriliteral) (such as 
z-l-z-l, b-r-h-n, t-r-j-m), and five-consonant roots (quinquiliteral) (such as b-r-n-m-j).9
The root is said to contain lexical meaning because it communicates the idea of
a real-world reference or general field denotation (such as “writing”). It is useful
to think of a lexical root as denoting a semantic field because it is within that
7 The fact that they are abstract does not diminish the fact that they are strong psychological reali-
ties for Arabic speakers.  According to Frisch and Zawaydeh (2001, 92) “there is clear psycholinguis-
tic evidence that Arabic consonantal roots are a distinct component of the Arabic mental lexicon.”
8 I am indebted to Professor Wallace Erwin for this definition.
9 Aside from the reduplicated four-consonant root, such as w-s-w-s or h-m-h-m, which is inherently
Arabic, four- and five-consonant roots can be borrowings from other languages. Some have been
part of the Arabic lexicon for hundreds of years; others are recent borrowings (such as t-l-f-n ‘to
telephone’).  The Arab grammarian al-Khalil ibn Ahmad (d.791) made an extensive study of Arabic
lexical roots and determined which were Arabic and which were not according to rules of Arabic
phonology and phonotactics.  See Sara 1991 on al-Khalil’s phonology.

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
field that actual words come into existence, each one crystalizing into a specific
lexical item. The number of lexical roots in Arabic has been estimated between
5,000 and 6,500.10
2.2 A deﬁnition of pattern
A pattern is a bound and in many cases, discontinuous morpheme consisting of
one or more vowels and slots for root phonemes (radicals), which either
alone or in combination with one to three derivational affixes, interlocks
with a root to form a stem, and which generally has grammatical meaning.11
The pattern is defined as discontinuous because it intersperses itself among the
root consonants (as in the word kaatib).12 It is useful to think of it as a kind of tem-
plate onto which different roots can be mapped.13 The “derivational affixes” men-
tioned in the definition include the use of consonants that mark grammatical
functions, such as the derivational prefix mu- for many participles, the prefix ma-
for a noun of place, or the relative adjective suffix /-iyy/. Consonants that are
included in Arabic pattern formation are: / √/ (hamza), /t/ (taa√), /m/ (miim), /n/
(nuun), /s/ (siin), /y/ (yaa√), and /w/ (waaw). These consonants may be used as prefixes,
suffixes or even infixes.14 One further component of patterning is gemination or
doubling of a consonant. Therefore, the components of MSA pattern-formation
include: six vowels (three long: /aa/, /ii/, /uu/; three short: /a/, /i/, and /u/); seven
consonants (√, t, m, n, s, y, w); and the process of gemination.15
Patterns are said to possess grammatical (rather than lexical) meaning because
they signify grammatical or language-internal information; that is, they distin-
guish word types or word classes, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. They can
even signal very specific information about subclasses of these categories. For
example, noun patterns can readily be identified as active participle, noun of
place, noun of instrument, or verbal noun, to name a few. Because patterns are
10 Kouloughli (1994, 60) cites about 6,500 lexical roots found  in a dictionary of 50,000 lexical items.
Greenberg (1950) bases his study of lexical root phonotactics on 3,775 verb roots found in Lane
(1863) and Dozy (1881).
11 This definition is also from Professor Wallace Erwin.
12 There are a few patterns that consist of just one vowel (such as _a_ _, for example, Harb ‘war’ or
nawm ‘sleep,’ and these patterns are not considered discontinuous.  Most patterns, however,
involve more than one vowel.
13 Patterns are sometimes referred to as “prosodic templates” or “stem templates” in discussions of
morphological theory (see, e.g., Aronoff 1994, 134, Spencer 1994). For the concept of “templatic
morphology” see McCarthy and Prince 1990.
14 Such as the taa√infixed between the root consonants jiim and miim in the Form VIII verb ijtamaﬁ-a
‘to meet,’ for example, from the root j-m-ﬁ‘gathering together.’ Another example is the infixing of
waaw in the word shawaariﬁ, the plural of shaariﬁ‘street.’ Again, the infix is inserted between the
first and second consonants of the root.
15 A traditional mnemonic device for remembering Arabic morphological components is the
invented word sa√altumuuniihaaÉ¡«fƒªàdCÉ°S ‘you (pl.) asked me it.’

49
limited to giving grammatical or intralinguistic information, there are fewer
Arabic patterns than roots.
3 Word structure: root and pattern combined
Most Arabic words, therefore, are analyzed as consisting of two morphemes – a
root and a pattern – interlocking to form one word. Neither an Arabic root nor a
pattern can be used in isolation; they need to connect with each other in order to
form actual words. A word such as kaatib ‘writer,’ for example, consists of two
bound morphemes: the lexical root k-t-b and the active participle pattern _aa_i_
(where the slots stand for root consonants).16 When a root is mapped onto a pat-
tern, they together form a word, “writer,” (“doer of the action of writing”). This
word can then act as a stem for grammatical affixes such as case-markers. For
example, the accusative indefinite suffix -an: 
.kÉÑJÉc Éæ∏HÉb
qaabal-naa kaatib-an.
We met a writer.
Understanding the system of root–pattern combinations enables the learner to
deduce or at least wisely guess at a wide range of word meanings through compo-
sitional semantics by putting together root and pattern meanings to yield a word
meaning. This ultimately lightens the load of vocabulary learning.17
4 Dictionary organization
Arabic dictionaries are based on lexical roots and not word spelling.18 Instead of
relying on the exact orthography of a word, Arabic dictionaries are organized by
the root or consonant core of a word, providing under that entry every word
derived from that particular root. The root is therefore often called a “lexical root”
because it is the actual foundation for the lexicon, or dictionary. The lexical root
16 In their work on Arabic templatic morphology, McCarthy and Prince propose separating Arabic
root and pattern components into distinct “tiers” in accordance with the “Prosodic Morphology
Hypothesis” (1990, 3–6).
17 It is important to note that not all Arabic word-meanings are semantically transparent, despite the
rigor of the system. Many words have come to have particular connotations due to cultural, histor-
ical, and regional factors and need to be learned through use of the dictionary. (See Bateson 2003,
1–3.) For a helpful analysis of Arabic morphology as it relates to the lexicon, see Stowasser 1981.
18 The roots in an Arabic dictionary are listed alphabetically according to the order of letters in the
Arabic alphabet. For example, the root k-t-f comes after k-t-b because /f / comes after /b/ in the
alphabet. Therefore, in order to find the root, one has to know the order of the alphabet.  This is
dealt with further in Appendix 1. This system applies to genuinely Arabic words or words that
have been thoroughly Arabized.  However, loanwords – words borrowed from other languages –
are listed in an Arabic dictionary by their spelling. Note that pre-modern Arabic dictionaries may
have alternative arrangements of the root consonants. See Haywood 1965 on the history of Arabic
lexicography.

50
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
provides a semantic field within which actual vocabulary items can be located. In
this respect, an Arabic dictionary might be seen as closer to a thesaurus than a
dictionary, locating all possible variations of meaning in one referential domain
or semantic field under one entry. See Appendix 1 for a summary of how to use an
Arabic dictionary.
5 Other lexical types
5.1 Compounding into one word (naHt âëf)
Another word-formation process exists in Arabic: compounding, composing a
word by conjoining other words. There are several subprocesses or variations on
this procedure, and although it is not common in traditional Arabic morphology,
it is used in MSA for recently coined items and for loan-translations, especially
technical terms. The classic MSA example is the word ra√smaal ‘capital’ formed
from conjoining the words ra√s ‘head’ and maal ‘money.’ Another example is laa-
markaziyya ‘decentralization,’ from the words laa ‘no’ and markaziyya ‘centraliza-
tion.’ Sometimes only part of a word is used in the compound, as in the word for
‘supersonic,’ faw-SawTiyy, abbreviating the word for ‘above, super’ fawq to faw- ,
joining it with the noun SawT ‘sound,’ and suffixing the adjectival /-iyy/ ending.19
5.2 Compounding into two words (tarkiib Ö«côJ)
Sometimes the lexical item created is not one single word in Arabic, but a noun
phrase, such as ﬁadam wujuud ‘non-existence’ or kiis hawaa√‘airbag,’ or a combined
participle-noun phrase such as mutaﬁaddid-u l-√aTraaf, ‘multilateral.’ With the
necessity for rapid translation of technical and computational terms from
Western languages into Arabic, these kinds of lexical compounds have become
more prevalent over the past two or three decades. See Chapter 5, section 15.2 for
further detail on this type of lexical innovation.
5.3 Solid stems
Solid stems are words which cannot be reduced or analyzed into the root–pattern
paradigm. They consist of primarily three sets in Arabic: pronouns, function
words, and loanwords. Solid-stem words are listed in Arabic dictionaries according
to their spelling.
5.3.1 Pronouns
Arabic pronoun categories include personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns,
and relative pronouns. These categories do not fit precisely into the standard root
and pattern system, although they show definite phonological relationships to
19 See Stetkevych 1970, 48–55. See also Chapter 5, section 15.1.

Arabic word structure: an overview
51
each other within their categories, such as the relation between haadhaa ‘this
(m.)’ and haadhihi ‘this (f.)’.
5.3.2 Function words
Another common subset of solid stems consists of Arabic function words – such as
prepositions and conjunctions. These are high-frequency items, and in terms of
their structure, they are usually short or even monosyllabic. For example: fii, ‘in;
at,’ √ilaa, ‘to, towards,’ or wa- ‘and.’
5.3.3 Loanwords
There are also a number of words (primarily nouns) in MSA that are borrowed
directly from other languages, and these are considered, for the most part, to have
solid stems, e.g., they cannot be broken down into roots and patterns, such as the
words raadyuu ‘radio’ and kumbyuutir ‘computer.’20
Many proper nouns fall into this category, as well, including Middle Eastern
place names such as baghdaad, ‘Baghdad’ and bayruut ‘Beirut.’21 Such words are
discussed at greater length in Chapter 5.
6 Inﬂection: an overview of grammatical categories in Arabic
The term “inflection” generally refers to phonological changes a word undergoes as
it is being used in context. In English, some common inflectional categories are:
number (singular and plural), tense (e.g., past, present), and voice (active and passive).
Generally speaking, Arabic words are marked for more grammatical categories
than are English words. Some of these categories are familiar to English speakers
(such as tense and number) while others, such as inflection for case or gender, are
not. There are eight major grammatical categories in Arabic: tense/aspect, person,
voice, mood, gender, number, case, definiteness. Six of these apply to verbs
(tense/aspect, person, voice, mood, gender, number), four apply to nouns and
adjectives (gender, number, case, definiteness), and four apply to pronouns (person,
gender, number and – to a limited extent – case).
Here is a brief summary of these categories and their roles in Arabic. Details on
all these topics are found as noted under specific reference points.
6.1 Tense/Aspect
Tense and aspect can be seen as two different ways of viewing time. Tense usually
deals with linear points extending from the past into the future. Aspect sees the
20 A few words borrowed from Western languages, such as “film” and “bank” fit so well into the
root–pattern system that Arabic plurals have evolved for them – √aflaam and bunuuk, respectively. 
21 These names are not originally Arabic but derive from other languages of the region such as
Aramaic or Persian.

52
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
completeness of an action or state as central: is the action over with and com-
pleted, ongoing, or yet to occur? The points of view of the two terms are different:
one focuses on when the action occurs and the other focuses on the action itself –
whether it is complete or not. These two grammatical categories do overlap to
some extent and have in practice blended into one in MSA.22
There are two basic morphological tenses in Arabic: past and present, also
called perfective and imperfective, respectively. In dealing with the modern writ-
ten language, many linguists and teachers find it more pragmatic to describe
Arabic verbs in terms of tense, and the terms past/present (referring to time or
tense) and perfect/imperfect (referring to aspect) are often used interchangeably.
There is also a future tense, indicated by prefixing either sa- or sawfa to a present
tense form. Other tenses exist, such as the past perfect, the future perfect, and the
past continuous, but they are compound tenses involving the use of auxiliary
verbs and particles.23
6.2 Person
Arabic verbs and personal pronouns inflect for three persons: first person (I, we),
second person (you), and third person (she, he, they). There are differences with
English, however, in the gender and number of these persons. For the Arabic first
person (√anaa, naHnu) there is no gender distinction. For the second person, there
are five forms of “you”: masculine singular (√anta), feminine singular (√anti), dual
(√antumaa), masculine plural (√antum) and feminine plural (√antunna). For the third
person, there are six verbal distinctions and five pronoun distinctions: he (huwa),
she (hiya), they-two masculine (humaa), they-two feminine (humaa), they masculine
(hum) and they feminine (hunna). (See charts in Chapter 12.) Thus, the total num-
ber of person categories in Arabic is thirteen, as opposed to the seven of English
(I, you, he, she, it, we, they).
6.3 Voice
The category of voice refers to whether an Arabic verb or participle is active or pas-
sive. Generally speaking, the passive is used in Arabic only if the agent or doer of
the action is unknown or not to be mentioned for some reason. There are sets of
22 In his description of “the states (tenses) of the verb” in Classical Arabic, Wright (1967, I:51) says:
“The temporal forms of the Arabic verb are but two in number, the one expressing a finished act,
one that is done and completed in relation to other acts (the Perfect); the other an unfinished act,
one that is just commencing or in progress (the Imperfect)” (emphasis in original). On the same
page he gives an indication of the complexity of Arabic tense/aspect relations when he states that
“The Arabian Grammarians . . . have given an undue importance to the idea of time, in connection
with the verbal forms, by their division of it into the past (al-maaDii»°VÉŸG) the present (al-Haal
∫É◊G or al-HaaDirô°VÉ◊G) and the future (al-mustaqbalπÑ≤à°ùŸG) the first of which they assign
to the Perfect and the other two to the Imperfect.”
23 See Chapter 21 on verb inflection.

Arabic word structure: an overview
53
morphological inflections and syntactic constructions particular to the passive
and these are dealt with in Chapter 38.
6.4 Mood
Mood or “mode” refers to verb categories such as indicative, subjunctive, imperative,
or (in Arabic) jussive. These categories reflect contextual modalities that condition
the action of the verb. For example, whereas the indicative mood tends to be char-
acteristic of straightforward statements or questions, the subjunctive indicates an
attitude toward the action such as doubt, desire, wishing, or necessity, and the
imperative mood indicates an attitude of command or need for action on the part
of the speaker. 
The issue of mood marking is a central one in Arabic grammar (along with case
marking). Moods fall under the topic of morphology because they are reflected in
word structure; they are usually indicated by suffixes or modifications of suffixes
attached to the present tense verb stem, and the phonological nature of the verb
stem determines what form the suffix will take. The mood markers are often
short vowel suffixes, for example, /-u/ for indicative and /-a/ for subjunctive.
In Arabic, mood marking is done only on the imperfective or present tense
stem; there are no mode variants for the past tense. The Arabic moods are there-
fore non-finite; that is, they do not refer to specific points in time and are not dif-
ferentiated by tense. Tense is inferred from context and other parts of the clause.
Mood marking is determined either by particular particles which govern or
require certain moods (e.g., the negative particle lam requires the jussive mood on
the following verb) or by the narrative context in general, including attitude of
the speaker and intended meaning. See Chapters 34 and 35 on verb moods.
6.5 Gender
Arabic exhibits two genders: masculine and feminine.24 For the most part, gender
is overtly marked, but there are words whose gender is covert and shows up only
in agreement sequences. The gender category into which a noun falls is semanti-
cally arbitrary, except where nouns refer to human beings or other living crea-
tures. Gender is marked on adjectives, pronouns, and verbs, as well, but is not
inherent, as it is in nouns. Gender is discussed at greater length in Chapter 7.
6.6 Number
Arabic has three number categories: singular, dual, and plural. Whereas singular
and plural are familiar categories to most Western learners, the dual is less
24 A very few nouns are both masculine and feminine, for example: ‘salt’ milH and ‘spirit’ ruuH
(see Chapter 7 for further discussion).

54
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
familiar.25 The dual in Arabic is used whenever the category of “two” applies,
whether it be in nouns, adjectives, pronouns, or verbs.
The concept of plural therefore applies to three or more entities. This category
interacts in specific ways with the category of gender and also with a morphologi-
cal category which is peculiar to Arabic: humanness. Both gender and humanness
affect the way in which a noun, participle, or adjective is pluralized.
Numerals themselves, their structural features and the grammatical rules for
counting and sequential ordering, constitute one of the most complex topics in
Arabic. They are discussed in Chapter 15.
6.7 Case
Arabic nouns and adjectives normally inflect for three cases: nominative, geni-
tive, and accusative. Cases fall under the topic of morphology because they are
part of word structure; they are usually suffixes attached to the word stem, and
the nature of the word stem determines what form the suffix will take.26 In gen-
eral, the case markers are short vowel suffixes: -u for nominative, -i for genitive
and -a for accusative, but there are substantial exceptions to this.27 A case-mark-
ing paradigm is usually referred to as a declension; there are eight different nomi-
nal declensions in Arabic and these are discussed in Chapter 7.
Cases also fall under the topic of syntax because they are determined by the syn-
tactic role of a noun or adjective within a sentence or clause.28 To indicate roughly
how the system works, the nominative case typically marks the subject role (most
often the agent or doer of an action); the accusative marks the direct object of a
transitive verb or it may mark an adverbial function; and the genitive is used
mainly in two roles: marking the object of a preposition and marking the possessor
in a possessive structure. For case roles and rules, see Chapter 7, section 5.
6.8 Deﬁniteness: determiners
Arabic has both definite and indefinite markers. The definite marker is a word
(al-) which is not independent but is prefixed to nouns and adjectives; the indefi-
niteness marker is an affix (-n), normally suffixed to the case-marking vowel on
nouns and adjectives; thus, al-bayt-u (‘the house’ – nominative, definite), but bayt-u-n
(‘a house’ – nominative, indefinite). The suffixed /-n/ sound is not written with the
25 In English, there are some words that refer specifically to two items such as “both” and “pair.”
26 For example, a diptote word such as wuzaraa√‘ministers’ will show the genitive marker as fatHa,
not kasra, because of the nature of its morphological pattern: CuCaCaa√.
27 The exceptions fall into two categories: exceptions determined by morphological rules (such as the
word pattern) and exceptions determined by phonological rules (such as the rule that two vowels
cannot combine).
28 Traditional Arabic grammar deals with case inflections as a category of syntax (naHw) rather than
morphology (Sarf).

55
letter /n/ (nuun) but is indicated by modifying the short vowel case-marker (see
Chapter 7, section 4). Whereas the definite article is visible in Arabic script, the
indefinite marker normally is not.29
7 Distribution of inﬂectional categories: paradigms
In terms of the distribution of the above eight categories of inflection, Arabic
verbs inflect for the first six: tense/aspect, person, voice, mood, gender, and
number. Nouns and adjectives inflect for the last four: gender, number, case, and
definiteness. Pronouns inflect for gender, number, and – to some extent – case.
Any verb, for example, can be analyzed as being marked for six categories; any
noun can be analyzed for four categories and any pronoun for three. This means
that word structure in MSA is complex, and that verbs have the most complex
structure of all.
Grammatical paradigms are charts or frameworks for words which show all
their possible inflections.30 In traditional Western grammars, there are two major
divisions of paradigms: verbs and nominals (nouns, adjectives and pronouns). A
verb paradigm is called a conjugation; a nominal paradigm is called a declension.
Verbs are said to “conjugate” or inflect for verbal categories of tense, person, num-
ber, gender, mood, and voice. Nominals are said to “decline,” to inflect for case,
number, gender, and definiteness.
The forms or phonological realizations that these categories take in any partic-
ular word are determined by that word’s membership in an inflectional class.31
8 MSA inﬂectional classes
An inflectional class contains words whose inflections (either declension or con-
jugation) are identical, or at least highly similar.
Criteria for inflectional classes: Verbs fall into several classes by virtue of their
phonological structure, which affects how they inflect (e.g., hollow verbs, defec-
tive verbs, assimilated verbs). So do nouns and adjectives (e.g., triptotes and dip-
totes). In addition, nouns and/or adjectives may fall into certain classes because of
their origins and etymology. In order to help learners with these many categories
and the forms that they take, this reference grammar provides paradigms or
28 The exception to this is the accusative indefinite suffix -an, which is often written into the script
with an √alif and two fatHas.
30 Carstairs-McCarthy points out that there is an abstract notion of paradigm (“the set of
combinations of morphosyntactic properties or features . . . realized by inflected forms of words
(or lexemes) in a given word-class (or major category or lexeme class) in a given language”) as well
as a concrete one: “the set of inflectional realizations expressing [an abstract paradigm] for a given
word (or lexeme) in a given language” (1994, 739).
31 I am following Aronoff’s (1994, 65) definition of inflectional class: “a set of lexemes whose members
each select the same set of inflectional realizations.”  Carstairs-McCarthy gives a similar definition:
“a set of words (lexemes) displaying the same paradigm in a given language” (1994, 739).

morphophonemic processes underlying the resulting forms.
9 Case and mood: special inﬂectional categories in Arabic 
As can be seen in the above descriptions, there are two Arabic inflectional
categories that interface with syntax: case and mood. Both of them mark this
interfacing by short vowel suffixes, called in English “moods” or “modes” when
they apply to verbs, and “cases” when they apply to nouns or adjectives. One of the
interesting features of Arabic structure is that the nominative case (on nouns and
adjectives) and the indicative marker (on verbs) are to a large extent identical:
suffixed /-u/; and the accusative and subjunctive markers are largely identical as
well: suffixed /-a/.32 It is important for learners of Arabic to know that in Arabic
grammar these two categories are referred to as one; that is, nominative and
indicative are considered one category: rafﬁor marfuuﬁ, and accusative and
subjunctive are considered another: naSb or manSuub.
Because of these formal similarities, case and mood are treated as categories of
syntax (naHw) in traditional Arabic grammar, and for very sound and compelling
reasons. Moreover, there is no theoretical distinction in Arabic between case and
mood.  Readers who are interested in morphological theory or in studying Arabic
grammar more extensively should keep in mind that Arabic sets these categories
apart, and that they are of great – even central – importance in Arabic syntactic
theory. One can certainly say that these two categories are closer to the syntactic
level of analysis than to the semantic or lexical level.33
32 This is, of course, a generalization. Other formal realizations of these categories exist, but this is
the major one.
33 See Ryding 1993 for more on this topic. See also the entries Sarf and naHw in the Encyclopedia of
Islam; and Bohas, Guillaume and Kouloughli 1990, especially Chapters 3 and 4.

This chapter deals with very basic sentence structure and relations among
sentence elements.
1. Essential principles of sentence structure
There are two major syntactic principles that affect the structure of Arabic
phrases and clauses: agreement/concord and government.
1.1 Agreement or concord (muTaabaqa á≤HÉ£e)
Agreement or concord is where words in a phrase or clause show feature compati-
bility, that is, they match or conform to each other, one reflecting the other’s
features. For example, a verb is masculine singular if it has a masculine singular sub-
ject. A feminine singular noun takes a feminine singular adjective, and so forth. In
order to undertake this matching or agreement of features, one needs to be aware of
the rules for agreement, and of the categories that constitute feature compatibility.
Generally, in discussion of case systems, the term concord is used to refer to
matching between nouns and their dependants (typically adjectives, other nouns,
or pronouns), whereas agreement refers to matching between the verb and its
subject.1 Often, however, these terms are used synonymously. Categories of con-
cord and agreement in Arabic include: gender, number, definiteness, and case for
nouns and adjectives, and inflection for gender, number, and person for verbs
and pronouns.2
1.2 Government (ﬁamal πªY)
Government is a syntactic principle wherein certain words cause others to inflect
in particular ways — not in agreement with the “governing” word (the ﬁaamil
πeÉY), but as a result of the effect of the governing word.3

Basic Arabic sentence structures
1 See Blake 1994, 186, footnote 6.
2 For a detailed historical overview of Arabic and Semitic agreement structures, see Russell 1984.
3 The term “government” as an equivalent for the Arabic term ﬁamal is used extensively, but other
terms such as “operation” and “regimen” are also used in English translations. All these terms refer
to the power of one word, one structure, or one concept to affect the inflection of another word.

In his four-volume grammar of modern Arabic, al-naHw al-waafii, Abbaas Hasan
defines ﬁaamil as “what supervenes on a word and thereby affects its ending by
making it nominative/indicative, accusative/subjunctive, genitive, or jussive”
(maa ya-dxul-u ﬁalaa l-kalimat-i fa-yu-√aththir-u fii √aaxir-i-haa bi-l-raf ﬁ-i, √aw-i l-naSb-i,
√aw-i l-jarr-i √aw-i l-jazm-i).4
Typical “governors” (ﬁawaamil πeGƒY) in Arabic are verbs, prepositions, and par-
ticles. For example, a transitive verb takes or “governs” a direct object in the accu-
sative case. Or a certain particle, such as the negative future marker lan, requires
the subjunctive mood on the following verb; a preposition requires that its noun
object be in the genitive case, and so on.
Case (on substantives) and mood (on verbs) are the two categories affected by
government in Arabic.5
1.3 Dependency relations
Because of these essential principles that characterize the structure of words in
phrases and clauses, Arabic can be seen as a language that has a network of depend-
ency relations in every phrase or clause. These relations are key components of
the grammatical structure of the language.
2. The simple sentence
Traditional Arabic grammatical theory divides sentences into two categories
depending on the nature of the first word in the sentence. Sentences whose
first word is a noun or noun phrase are termed jumal ismiyya á«ª°SG πªL, or ‘nomi-
nal sentences,’ and sentences whose initial word is a verb are termed jumal fiﬁliyya
á«∏©a πªL, or ‘verbal sentences.’ This first-word criterion is not based on whether
the sentence contains a verb, but on whether the verb is initial or not.6
In the teaching of Arabic as a foreign language, however, a different distinction
is often used for classifying Arabic sentences. This distinction is based on whether
or not the sentence contains a verb. The English term “equational sentence” is
used to refer to verbless predications. The term “verbal sentence” refers to predi-
cations that contain a verb. As Abboud and McCarus state, “Arabic sentences are
of two types, those with verbs, called verbal sentences, and those not containing
verbs, called equational sentences” (emphasis in original; 1983, Part 1:102).
Confusion sometimes arises with the term “verbal sentence” because if one
uses it to refer to the traditional Arabic term, one means “sentence starting with
58
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
4 Hasan 1987, I:441. The definition is given in an extensive footnote that describes the types of ﬁaamil.
5 Sometimes the governor is an abstraction (ﬁaamil maﬁnawiyy…ƒæ©e πeÉY), such as the concept
“subject of an equational sentence” (ibtidaa√AGóàHG). For a general outline of the Arabic theory of gov-
ernment in English see Bohas, Guillaume, and Kouloughi 1991, 57-62. See also Hasan 1987 for further
description in Arabic of ﬁaamil lafZiyy ‘overt governor’ and ﬁaamil maﬁnawiyy ‘abstract governor.’
6 This theoretical distinction, however, is disputed. See Ayoub and Bohas 1983 for a counter
argument to the word-order criterion. For more on this, see Cantarino 1974, I:2.

a verb.” But if “verbal sentence” is used to refer to the distinction between verbless
and verb-containing sentences, it means “sentence containing a verb.” Similarly,
sometimes the terms jumla ismiyya and “equational sentence” are taken to be
equivalents, but they are not. A jumla ismiyya is a sentence that starts with a noun,
including those that contain verbs. An equational sentence refers to a predication
that is specifically verbless. These terms are not equivalent because they are based
on different criteria.
In this text, in keeping with the terms used by Abboud and McCarus, I use the
term “equational” to refer to verbless sentences, and “verbal sentence” to refer to
those containing a verb.
2.1 Equational sentences in general
Equational sentences are verbless. The reason these sentences are verbless is
because the Arabic verb ‘to be’ (kaan-a) is not normally used in the present tense
indicative; it is simply understood. These sentences consist of a subject or topic
(mubtada√: ‘what is begun with’) and predicate (xabar: ‘piece of information;
news’). That is, they typically begin with a noun phrase or pronoun and are com-
pleted by a comment on that noun phrase or pronoun. The comment or predicate
may take the form of different classes of words and phrases: nouns, predicate
adjectives, pronouns, or prepositional phrases. These sentences are “equational”
because the subject and predicate “equate” with each other and balance each
other out in a complete proposition, or equation.
2.1.1 The structure of equational sentences
The subject or topic of an equational sentence is in the nominative case, and so
is the predicate, if it is a noun or adjective. When the predicate is a noun,
pronoun, or adjective, it agrees with the subject in gender and number, but not
in definiteness.7 Generally, the subject is the first element in the sentence, but
sometimes the order is reversed, and the predicate comes first.
2.1.1.1 COMMON TYPES OF EQUATIONAL SENTENCES:
(1)
Noun/adjective: Here the subject is a noun with the definite article, and the
predicate is an adjective (or adjective phrase) marked for indefiniteness.

7 Blake (1994, 191, note 2) gives a clear description of the subject-predicate relationship for
equational sentences when he states that “the concord between a predicative noun or adjective
and a subject would normally be described as concord of the predicative word with the subject,
since it typically involves inherent features of the subject being marked on the predicate.”

Reversal of subject and predicate: Sometimes the predicate of an equa-
tional sentence will come before the subject. This most often happens
when the subject lacks the definite article.

Between (‘the two of’) them [are] two women.
(10)
Expression of possession: Possession is usually predicated by means of a
preposition or semi-preposition, and it often is the first element of the
equational sentence. Because the predication is in the form of a
prepositional phrase, the item that is possessed is in the nominative case,
being the subject of an equational sentence.

subject from the predicate.8 The pronoun agrees with the subject (or mub-
tada√) in gender and number:

al-√umm-u hiya namuudhaj-u kull-i l-nisaa√-i.
The mother [is] the model for all women.
(13)
Equational sentence with clause as predicate: In the following equa-
tional sentence, the subject is a compound one, and the predicate actu-
ally consists of another equational sentence “their source is one.”
.óMGh Éª¡∏°UCG ΩÓ°SE’Gh á«ë«°ùŸG
al-masiiHiyyat-u wa-l-√islaam-u √aSl-u-humaa waaHid-un.
Christianity and Islam [are from] one source (‘their source is one’).
(14)
Negation of verbless sentences: Verbless sentences are usually made
negative with the use of the verb lays-a ‘to not be’ (see Chapter 37 for fur-
ther description of lays-a). When lays-a is used, it changes the predicate of
the sentence from the nominative case to the accusative case.9

8 Eid (1991, 33) suggests that “the copula pronoun be analyzed as a predicate expressing the relation
of identity.”
9 It is therefore one of what are called the nawaasix or ‘converters-to-accusative’ described in
Chapter 7, section 5.3.3.8.

(15)
Non-present tense indicative equational sentences: Sentences that are
equational in the present tense indicative need a form of the verb kaan-a in
other tenses or moods. The verb kaan-a, like lays-a, requires that the predi-
cate of the equational sentence be in the accusative case (see Chapter 36):

2.2 The simple verbal sentence ( jumla fi cliyya á«∏©a á∏ªL)
2.2.1 Subject as verb inﬂection only
The simplest verbal sentence consists of a verb and its pronoun subject. The
subject pronoun is incorporated into the verb as part of its inflection. It is not
necessarily mentioned separately, as it is in English.10 Past tense verbs inflect with
a subject suffix; present tense verbs have subject prefix and also a suffix.
Basic Arabic sentence structures
63
10 In current linguistic terms, Arabic is a “pro-drop” language. That is, its verbs incorporate their
subject pronouns as part of their inflection, and separate subject pronouns are not necessary for
indicating person.

2.2.2 Speciﬁcation of noun subject
When a subject noun or noun phrase is specified, it usually follows the verb and
is in the nominative case. The verb agrees with the specified subject in gender.
The subject and verb together form a structural unit, or jumla á∏ªL.

áeRÓdG ∫É©aC’G  ájó©àŸG ÒZ ∫É©aC’G)
If the verb is intransitive, it does not take a direct object, but it may be comple-
mented by an adverbial or prepositional phrase:

2.2.4 Transitive verbs (al-√afﬁaal al-mutaﬁaddiya ájó©àŸG ∫É©aC’G)
If the verb is transitive, it takes a direct object, which is in the accusative case. It
may be a noun, a noun phrase, or a pronoun.

2.2.5 Mention of both subject and object
If both the subject and the object of the verb are specified, the word order is
usually Verb–Subject–Object (VSO). This is the standard word order of verbal
sentences in Arabic.

2.3 Summary of basic sentence relations
The basic dependency relations in a simple Arabic verbal sentence are therefore as
follows:
(1)
The subject is incorporated in the verb as part of its inflection.
(2)
The subject may also be mentioned explicitly, in which case it usually fol-
lows the verb and is in the nominative case. The verb agrees in gender with
its subject.
(3)
A transitive verb, in addition to having a subject, also takes a direct object in
the accusative case. This object follows the verb and any mentioned subject.
(4)
The basic word order is thus VSO: Verb–Subject–Object.
(5)
The word order may vary to SVO (Subject–Verb–Object) or even VOS
(Verb–Object–Subject) under certain conditions.11
2.4 Further dependency relations
There are a few issues that add to the complexity of the basic structure of syntactic
relations. These have to do with verb–subject agreement and word order.
2.4.1 Verb–subject agreement
In a verb-initial sentence or clause, the verb agrees with its subject in gender, but
not always in number. If the verb precedes the subject and the subject is dual or
plural, the verb remains singular.12 Thus a dual or plural noun subject when it
follows the verb, does not influence verb inflection for number.13
2.4.1.1 PLURAL OR DUAL SUBJECT FOLLOWING VERB: If the subject is plural or dual,
and it follows the verb, the verb inflects only for gender agreement, and not
number agreement. The verb remains singular.
Basic Arabic sentence structures

11 See Parkinson 1981 for a study of word-order shift in MSA.
12 This restriction on the number inflection of the Arabic verb is sometimes referred to as “agree-
ment asymmetry.” See Bolotin 1995 for further analysis of this topic.
13 See Mohammed 1990 for extensive analysis of issues in subject–verb agreement in MSA.

2.4.1.2 VARIATION IN WORD ORDER: Occasionally, the subject of a verbal sentence
or clause precedes the verb. In that case the verb agrees with it in gender and in
number:
(1)
Subject–Verb–Object (SVO): Within the body of a text the writer may
choose to start a sentence with a noun or noun phrase for stylistic reasons
or for emphasis. This inverted word order also happens in embedded
clauses. Moreover, certain fixed expressions are in the SVO order. When
the subject precedes the verb, the verb agrees with it in gender and in
number.15 Technically, this word order converts a jumla fiﬁliyya (verbal sen-
tence) into a jumla ismiyya (nominal sentence).

66
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
14 Note that the subject here is nonhuman, and therefore takes feminine singular agreement.
15 When a noun or noun phrase is sentence-initial, the sentence is considered a jumla ismiyya even if
it contains a verb, in accordance with traditional Arabic grammatical theory which bases sentence
categories on the nature of the sentence-initial word. See also note 6.

(2)
Headlines and topic sentences: In Arabic newspapers it is often the case
that the headline will be SVO whereas the first or lead sentence in the
article, recapping the same thing, will be VSO. This shift in word order
illustrates the attention-getting function of the SVO word order.16
Headline: SVO:
.Ú«eÓ°SE’G Ú£°TÉædG Qqò– É°ùfôa

Hadhdhar-at faransaa √ams-i √islaamiyy-iina mutashaddid-iina.
France yesterday warned Islamic extremists.
(3)
Preposed direct object (topic and comment): For stylistic reasons, an
object of a verb or preposition may be preposed at the beginning of a sen-
tence. In this case, a transitive verb (or prepositional phrase) requires a pro-
noun object to replace and refer to the preposed noun object. The pronoun
object on the verb agrees with the noun it refers to in gender and number.

Verb–Object–Subject (VOS): In some cases, the verb will come first, and
the object will come before the subject of the verb. This is especially true

(‘Left Amman yesterday the assistant minister of foreign affairs.’)
2.5 Doubly transitive verbs
There are a number of verbs in Arabic that take two objects. Both objects may be
expressed as nouns or noun phrases, or one or both may be expressed as a pronoun.
2.5.1 Both objects expressed as nouns or noun phrases
This occurs especially with verbs of asking, considering, requesting, and
appointing.
.IÒãc á∏Ä°SCG ÜÓ£dG GƒdCÉ°S
sa√al-uu l-Tullab-a √as√ilat-an kathiirat-an.
They asked the students many questions.
.GÒÑc É«îjQÉJ GRÉ‚EG Iƒ£ÿG √òg ¿ƒ«fÉª©dG ÈàYG
iﬁtabar-a l-ﬁumaaniyy-uuna haadhihi l-xuTwat-a √injaaz-an taariixiyy-an kabiir-an.
The Omanis considered this step a great historical accomplishment.
.¢ùØædG øY ´ÉaódG øe ÉYƒf Ωƒé¡dG GhÈàYG
iﬁtabar-uu l-hujuum-a nawﬁ-an min-a l-difaaﬁ-i ﬁan-i l-nafs-i.
They considered the attack a type of self-defense.
2.5.2 One object expressed as noun or noun phrase, the other as pronoun
.äÉæjô“ º¡`à£YCG 
√aﬁT-at-hum tamriinaat-in.
She gave them exercises.
.Ú∏°†ØŸG  º¡eƒ‚   º¡`fhÈà©j
ya-ﬁtabir-uuna-hum nujuum-a-hum-u l-mufaDDal-iina.
They consider them their favorite stars.
.áfÉª°V ¿hôNBG √Èà©j
ya-ﬁtabir-u-hu √aaxar-uuna Damaanat-an.
Others consider it an assurance.
.Qhó`H ΩÉ«≤dG √hó°TÉf
naashad-uu-hu l-qiyaam-a bi-dawr-in
They implored him to take a role.
2.5.3 Both objects expressed as pronouns
In this case, one object pronoun is suffixed onto the verb and the other attached to
the pronoun-carrier √iyyaah-. This occurs mainly with verbs of giving and sending.

√ahdaa-nii √iyyaa-hu √ahl-u faaTimat-a.
√aﬁTaa-naa √iyyaa-haa.
Fatima’s family sent it to me (‘sent me it’).
He gave it to us (‘gave us it’).
2.5.4 One object a noun or noun phrase, the other a predicate adjective
In this kind of double accusative, a definite noun serves as object of the verb and
an indefinite adjective describes the state or condition of that noun.
.á∏«ªL É«fódG ógÉ°T
.ÉMƒàØe ÜÉÑdG ∑ôJ
shaahad-a l-dunyaa jamiilat-an.
tarak-a l-baab-a maftuuH-an.
He saw the world [as] beautiful.
He left the door open.
2.5.5 Passive constructions with doubly transitive verbs
When a doubly transitive verb is in a passive construction, one object becomes the
subject of the passive verb (an in the nominative case if mentioned specifically)
and the other object remains in the accusative case:
.Ó£H êpqƒoJ
.Ó£H ÖYÓdG êqpƒoJ
tuwwij-a baTal-an.
tuwwij-a l-laaﬁib-u baTal-an.
He was crowned champion.
The athlete was crowned champion.
.IÒãc á∏Ä°SCG ÜÓ£dG πÄ°S
su√il-a l-Tullaab-u √as√ilat-an kathiirat-an.

.áØ«∏î∏d Éq°UÉN ÉÑ«ÑW øpq«oY
ﬁuyyin-a Tabiib-an xaaSS-an li-l-xaliifat-i.
He was appointed [as] special physician to the Caliph.
2.5.6 Dative movement with doubly transitive verbs
Where one of the objects of the verb is an indirect object, or beneficiary of the
action, an optional structure using the dative-marking prepositions li- or √ilaa is
possible. It is only permissible, however, if the beneficiary noun follows the direct
object, e.g.:
.âæÑ∏d ÜÉàµdG â«£YCG
√aﬁTay-tu l-kitaab-a li-l-bint-i.
I gave the book to the girl.
Otherwise, the beneficiary noun precedes the object noun and is in the accusa-
tive case.18
70
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
18 These examples are taken from Ryding 1981, 19–23.

.ÜÉàµdG âæÑdG â«£YCG
√aﬁTay-tu l-bint-a l-kitaab-a.
I gave the girl the book.
2.5.7 Semantic structure of doubly transitive verbs
These verbs fall into four semantic classes:
2.5.7.1 Where the second object is what would be termed an indirect object or
beneficiary of the action (“I gave Noura the book,” i.e., “I gave the book to
Noura”); 
.äÉæjô“ º¡``à£YCG
√aﬁT-at-hum tamriinaat-in.
She gave them exercises.
2.5.7.2 Where the second object is equivalent to the first (“We consider him a
great author.”) This includes evaluative verbs of deeming, judging, and
considering, such as iﬁtabara.19
.Ú∏°†ØŸG º¡eƒ‚ º¡``fhÈà©j
ya-ﬁtabir-uuna-hum nujuum-a-hum-u l-mufaDDal-iina.
They consider them their favorite stars.
2.5.7.3 Where the first accusative is caused to be the second (“They appointed
her ambassador”) but both refer to the same entity. These verbs include actions
such as making, creating, naming, and appointing.
.IÒØ°S Égƒæq«Y
ﬁayyan-uu-haa safiirat-an.
They appointed her ambassador.
2.5.7.4 Where each object is different (“He taught the students English”  “He
caused the students to learn English.”). These are usually Form II or Form IV
verbs, causatives of transitive base verbs, such as (Form II) darras-a ‘to teach’ (‘to
cause someone to study something’) or (Form IV) √araa ‘to show’ (‘to cause
someone to see something’).20

19 This group has a special designation in Arabic called √afﬁaal al-qalb,√afﬁaal qalbiyya or √afﬁaal
quluub ‘verbs of the heart’ because they denote intellectual or emotional evaluations. See Chapter 7,
section 5.3.3 on accusative case.
20 For detailed analysis of double accusatives in MSA see Abboud and McCarus 1983, Part 2:93–96 and
for Classical Arabic, see Wright 1967, II:47–53.

.ïjQÉàdG »æ`°SqQO
darras-a-nii l-taariix-a.
He taught me history.
3. Other sentence elements
Sentence elements other than verb, subject, and object (in verbal sentences)
and subject and predicate (in equational sentences) include various types of
adverbials.21
3.1 Placement of adverbials in basic sentences
Arabic adverbial expressions are considered “extras” in the sentence ( faDla á∏°†a)
because they give information external to the core VS or VSO structure. They are
usually quite flexible in their placement and can occur at almost any point in a
clause, especially if they consist of short words. More than one may occur in a
sentence.
.IÓ°üdG ‘ ¬«dÉ«d »°†≤j
ya-qDii layaalii-hi fii l-Salaat-i.
He spends his nights in prayer.
.ójó÷G »µjôeC’G ÒØ°ùdG ¢ùeCG IôgÉ≤dG QOÉZ
ghaadar-a l-qaahirat-a √ams-i l-safiir-u l-√amriikiyy-u l-jadiid-u.
The new American ambassador left Cairo yesterday.
.A§Ñ`H ƒªæJ
ta-nm-uu bi-buT√-in.
They grow slowly.
¢ùeCG ¬dÉb Éª`d Gó«cCÉJ
ta√kiid-an li-maa qaal-a-hu √ams-i
affirming what he said yesterday
4. Compound or complex sentences
Compound or complex sentences consist of more than one predication. They
contain clauses related by means of coordinating conjunctions such as wa- ‘and,’
fa- ‘and; and so,’ or bal ‘but rather.’ These conjunctions have little or no effect on
the syntax or morphology of the following clause but build up the sentence
contents in an additive way. 
Complex sentences, on the other hand, consist of a main clause and one or
more subordinate or embedded clauses. Subordinate clauses are of three main

types – complement clauses, adverbial clauses, and relative clauses. In each case,
there is usually a linking or connective element (such as √anna ‘that’ or li-kay ‘in
order that’ or alladhii ‘who; which’) bringing the two clauses into relation with
each other. Many Arabic subordinating conjunctions have a grammatical effect
on the structure of the following clause. For example, √anna and related particles
are followed by a clause whose subject is either a suffixed pronoun or a noun in
the accusative; li-kay is followed by a verb in the subjunctive mood.
Specific compound and complex sentence types are dealt with in the following
chapters:
Chapter 14: Relative pronouns and relative clauses
Chapter 18: Connectives and conjunctions
Chapter 19: Subordinating conjunctions: the particle √inna and her sisters
Chapter 34: Moods of the verb I: indicative and subjunctive
Chapter 35: Moods of the verb II: jussive and imperative

Basic Arabic sentence structures

Arabic nouns fall into a number of different categories depending on their
morphology and their relationship to Arabic lexical roots.1 The extensive range of
noun types yields a wealth of lexical possibilities that contribute to what Charles
Ferguson has called the sense of “vastness and richness of the Arabic lexicon.”2
Two morphological criteria traditionally define Arabic nouns: they can take the
definite article and/or they can take nunation.
Most Arabic nouns are derived from triliteral or quadriliteral lexical roots, and
all nouns derived from a particular root are found in an Arabic or Arabic–English
dictionary clustered under that root entry. Some nouns, however, have restricted
roots; certain ones have only two root consonants, others have up to five root con-
sonants. Yet other nouns have solid stems, unanalyzable into roots and patterns.
This chapter is intended to give an overview of these noun types, with examples.
It is by no means exhaustive and does not go into derivational detail within
categories.3 For inflectional characteristics of nouns, see the chapter on noun
inflection.
Arabic nouns are usually derived from lexical roots through application of
particular morphological patterns. The use of patterns interlocking with root
phonemes allows the formation of actual words or stems. Noun patterns them-
selves carry certain kinds of meaning, such as “place where action is done,” “doer
of action,” “name of action,” or “instrument used to carry out action.” The most
frequent MSA noun patterns are as follows.4
74
5
Arabic noun types
1 In traditional Arabic grammar, the term ism ‘noun’ covers a wide range of form classes. As Abboud
et al. (1997, 67) state: “Nouns are divided into five subclasses: nouns, pronouns, demonstratives,
adjectives and noun-prepositions.” In this chapter, the topic is restricted to nouns per se. Note that
the traditional Arabic definition of a noun is: kalimat-un dall-at ﬁalaa maﬁnan fii nafs-i-hi, wa-lays-a 
l-zaman-u juz√-an min-haa; ‘a word indicating a meaning in itself and not containing any reference
to time’ (ﬁAbd al-Latif et al. 1997, 9).
2 Ferguson 1970, 377. On the same page he points to the “very complex but highly regular and
symmetrical structure of the derivational system.”
3 For further analysis of Classical Arabic noun types, consult Wright 1967, I:106 ff. and Fleisch 1961,
I:349–469.
4 Fleisch 1961, I:267 has a useful chart of noun types: “Tableau du développement morphologique
en arabe.”

Arabic noun types
75
1 Verbal noun (al-maSdar Qó°üŸG)
Verbal nouns are systematically related to specific verb forms and can come from
triliteral or quadriliteral roots. The verbal noun or maSdar names the action
denoted by its corresponding verb, for example, wuSuul ∫ƒ°Uh ‘arrival’ from the
Form I verb waSal-a nπn°Unh ‘to arrive,’ or √idaara InQGOpEG ‘administration; management’
from the Form IV verb √adaar-a nnQGOnCG/ oôjóoj yu-diir-u ‘to manage, direct.’5 Each maSdar
is systematically related to a specific verb form and can be derived from triliteral
or quadriliteral roots. Verbal nouns are often abstract in meaning, but some of
them have specific, concrete reference e.g., binaa√AÉæpH ‘building’ (either the act of
building, or the structure itself). In terms of their syntactic usage, verbal nouns
may also express in Arabic what an infinitive expresses in English.6
This section provides an outline of the typical verbal noun derivation patterns
from verb forms I–X and for quadriliterals I–IV. There is further elaboration on
these forms in each section devoted to the particular form and its derivations. In
this section also there are examples of the typical functions of verbal nouns in
context.
1.1 Triliteral root verbal nouns
These nouns name the action denoted by the forms of the verb. The Form I verbal
noun patterns are abundant and hard to predict; the derived form verbal nouns
are much more predictable in their patterns. These patterns and noun classes are
described in detail in the chapters on the various verb forms. Examples here serve
to illustrate the extent of this noun class and the types of meaning conveyed by
verbal nouns.
1.1.1 Form I
The morphological patterns for creation of verbal nouns from Form I are many
and not predictable.7 Wright lists forty-four possible verbal noun patterns for
Form I or as he terms it, “the ground form” of the ordinary triliteral verb (1967,
I:110–12); Ziadeh and Winder (1957, 71–72) list eighteen of the most commonly
5 The Arabic term maSdar/maSaadir also means ‘source,’ an indication that the term for this type of
noun refers to its essential nature as the name of an activity or state. The different schools of
medieval Arabic grammatical analysis, the Basrans and Kufans, debated whether the noun or the
verb is the most basic element of language, the Basrans arguing that the verbal noun is prior, and
the Kufans that the verb is prior.
6 Note that the citation form of the verb in Arabic is not an infinitive but a finite, inflected verb
form (third person masculine singular past tense). The maSdar is much closer in meaning to an
infinitive, but it is not used as a citation form in Arabic.
7 ﬁAbd al-Latif, ﬁUmar, and Zahran state that “The verbal nouns of the base form are many and
varied and cannot be known except by resorting to language [reference] books” maSaadir-u 
l-thulaathiyy-i kathiirat-un wa-mutanawwaﬁat-un laa tu-ﬁraf-u √illaa bi-l-rujuu-ﬁ-i √ilaa kutub-i l-lughat-i
(1997, 83).

1.3 Special characteristics of verbal nouns in context
The function and distribution of verbal nouns parallel that of other nouns except
that in addition to those functions, the verbal noun may retain some of its verbal
force. There are three ways in which verbal nouns are distinctive in their use: 
(1)
they may serve as the equivalent of an infinitive;
(2)
when the verbal noun is from a transitive verb and serves as the first term
in an √iDaafa áaÉ°VEG structure, it may take an object in the accusative case; 
(3)
they may be used as verb intensifiers in the cognate accusative (mafﬁuul
muTlaq ≥n∏r£oe ∫ƒ©rØne) construction.
1.3.1 Verbal noun as equivalent to gerund or inﬁnitive
The verbal noun may be used as the object of a verbal expression where the Eng-
lish equivalent would be either a gerund or an infinitive.9
.Aƒ°V AÉ≤dEG ∫hÉMCÉ°S
sa-√u-Haawil-u √ilqaa√-a Daw √-in.
I shall try to shed/shedding light.
9 In such constructions, the verbal noun is normally interchangeable with the particle √an plus a
subjunctive verb.

1.3.2.4 VERBAL NOUNS FROM TRANSITIVE VERBS: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS. When
a verbal noun derived from a transitive verb is the first term of an √iDaafa, a
number of possibilities exist for expressing both the doer of the action (the
subject of the verb underlying the verbal noun) and the recipient of the action
(the object of the underlying verb).
(1)
The first term of the √iDaafa is a verbal noun and the second term is the
subject of the underlying verb:

(3) Verbal noun  subject and object: When the subject of the underlying verb
is the second term of the √iDaafa, or when it takes the form of a pronoun
suffix on the verbal noun, the object of the underlying verb may still be
mentioned. It follows the √iDaafa or the verbal noun plus pronoun and is in
the accusative case. Thus the verbal noun retains some of its verbal force in
making the object noun accusative.
In most cases in the data covered for this work, the subject of the underly-
ing verb takes the form of a pronoun suffix on the verbal noun.

coming after the √iDaafa:

1.3.4 The cognate accusative: al-mafﬁuul al-muTlaq ≥∏£ŸG ∫ƒ©ØŸG
The cognate accusative emphasizes or intensifies a statement by using a verbal
noun derived from the main verb or predicate (which may also be in the form of
a participle or verbal noun). The verbal noun and any modifying adjectives are
usually in the indefinite accusative. For more on this topic, see Chapter 7, section

2 Active and passive participle (ism al-faaﬁil πYÉØdG º°SG, 
ism al-mafﬁuul ∫ƒ©ØŸG º°SG)
Arabic participles are descriptive terms derived from verbs. The active participle
describes or refers to the doer of the action and the passive participle describes or
refers to the object of the action. An entire chapter (Chapter 6) is devoted to these
multifunctional words but they are also included briefly here in order to provide
examples of yet another noun type in Arabic.
In terms of their structure, participles are predictably derived according to the
ten forms of the verb and have characteristic shapes. They may occur as masculine
or feminine. When participles refer to human beings, they reflect the gender of
the individual referred to. Some participles have acquired specific noun mean-
ings and may be either masculine in form (e.g., shaariﬁ´QÉ°T ‘street’) or feminine
(qaa√ima áªFÉb ‘list’).

84
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
Arabic verbs have both active and passive participles.10 This section lists exam-
ples of both, but more extensive descriptions of base and variant forms are found
in Chapter 6 and in the chapters on each form (I–X) of the verb.
2.1 Form I active participle (AP): faaﬁil πpYÉa
The Form I AP has the typical pattern of faacil or faacila. For AP nouns, the form of
the plural depends on whether the AP refers to a human being or not. APs refer-
ring to humans take either a sound plural or the broken plural fuccaal; those refer-
ring to nonhuman entities often take the fawaacil plural but may take other
plurals as well.

2.2 The extended Form II–X AP nouns
Form II–X APs are typified by having a prefix /mu-/ and a stem vowel kasra (/-i/).
Hollow and defective forms have special patterns described in Chapters 22–31. As
a general rule, the plurals for nonhuman referents are formed with the sound
feminine plural and for human referents with either the sound masculine or the
sound feminine plural.

2.3 Quadriliteral AP nouns: mufaﬁlil πp∏r©nØoe
Quadriliteral active participles of Form I are also characterized by a prefix /mu-/
and a stem vowel kasra (/-i-/). QPPs with human referents take either the sound
masculine or sound feminine plural; with those referring to nonhuman entities,
the sound feminine plural is usually used. Further discussion of quadriliteral par-
ticiples is found in Chapter 33.

2.4 Passive participles (PP)
Passive participles that have evolved into use as nouns have a wide range of mean-
ings, and it is not always possible to see immediately how their form relates to
their meaning. In the derived forms (II–X), the passive participle often functions
as the noun of place for that particular form of the verb (e.g., Form X PP: mustash-
fan ‘hospital, place of healing’ or Form VIII PP: muxtabar ‘laboratory, place of
experiment’).
2.4.1 Form I: mafﬁuul ∫ƒ©rØne
The PP of Form I has the typical pattern of mafﬁuul or mafﬁuula. The plural for
non-human PP nouns in this form is often mafaaﬁiil or the sound feminine plural;
for human referents, the sound plural is usually used.

4 Noun of instrument (ism al-√aala ádB’G º°SG)
A specific derivational pattern is used to denote nouns of instrument, i.e., nouns
that denote items used in accomplishing a certain action. The patterns are mifﬁaal
∫É©rØpe, mifﬁal πn©rØpe, and mifﬁala án∏n©rØpe. See also section 5.2 below.

5 Nouns of intensity, repetition, profession
A special noun pattern exists to denote intensity of action or repeated action:
faﬁﬁaal ∫Éq©na.12 For human beings the nouns usually denote profession, for example:
12 Nouns of intensity usually have a shadda on the middle radical, just as the Form II verb doubles
the middle radical in order to denote frequency or intensity. A certain iconicity appears to exist in
Arabic between doubling the strength of a consonant and reference to intensity or frequency of
action. For more on iconicity and sound symbolism in Arabic see E. K. Wright 2000.

5.2 Nouns of intensity as nouns of instrument
Occasionally, the pattern for nouns of intensity ( faﬁﬁaal ∫Éq©na or faﬁﬁaala ándÉq©na) is
used to denote an instrument. For machines or instruments that perform speci-
fied tasks, the feminine form of the noun of intensity is often used:

7 Generic noun (ism al-jins ¢ùæ÷G º°SG) and noun of instance 
(ism al-marra IôŸG º°SG)
Generic nouns refer to something in general, such as “laughter” or “agriculture.”
Sometimes they refer to something that can be counted and sometimes it is not
possible to pluralize the noun because it is an abstraction and a generality. It can
be said that the concept of “generic” contrasts with “specific.”13 Examples of
generic nouns in Arabic would be:
dancing
raqS
¢ürbnQ
support
daﬁm
ºrYnO
safety
√amaan
¿ÉenCG
victory
fawz
Rrƒna
Nouns that refer to actions in general, such as “laughing” or “dancing,” can be
contrasted with a singular occurrence or instance of that action, such as “a short
laugh” or “a traditional dance.” The generic term is often masculine singular,
whereas the individual instance is often feminine singular, marked by taa√mar-
buuTa. This is a general rule, but sometimes the generic term comes to be used to
refer to individual, concretized instances (e.g., binaa√– see below).

The plural used for counting or referring to a number of these instances of action
is often the sound feminine plural, but may also be a broken plural, especially if the
feminine singular is not used as the instance noun (e.g., binaa√‘a building’).

There is thus a formal distinction in Arabic between a noun that denotes a
generic activity or state and a semelfactive noun, that is, a noun that denotes a
single occurrence or instance of that activity and which is usually feminine. The
units or instances can be pluralized or counted using a plural form of the “noun
of instance.”
8 Diminutive (al-taSghiir Ò¨°üàdG)
There are specific noun patterns used to denote smallness or endearment. These
nouns can refer to small things such as a pocket dictionary, a short period of time,
or to people and people’s names.14 The main pattern is CuCayC or CuCayyaC.

9 Abstraction nouns ending with -iyya
Although many nouns with abstract meaning exist in Arabic, there is a morpho-
logical process for creating even more through suffixing the feminine nisba end-
ing -iyya (áj) to an already existing word stem. In this way, new concepts can be
readily created, and this category is an important one in MSA.15 In fact, its preva-
lence has led the Arabic Language Academy in Cairo to declare that this type of
noun may be derived from any word at all.16 Nouns created with this process take
14 The diminutive can also express contempt, but no examples of this occurred in the data.

10 Nouns not derived from verb roots
10.1 Primitive nouns
Certain nouns in Arabic are not derived from verb roots. Some of these are what
Wright (1967) and others refer to as “primitive,”17 i.e., well-attested substantives
that form part of the core lexicon of the language but are not verbal derivatives.18
In certain dictionaries, verbs may be listed with these nouns, but the verbs are
usually denominative – derived from the noun.
10.1.1 Triliteral

rajul

qïna

yawm

¢SrCGnQ
panther;

ór¡na
cheetah
10.1.2 Biliteral primitives
A few archaic nouns in Arabic have just two consonants (sometimes just one) in
the root. These often refer to basic family relationships, body parts, or essential
physical or social concepts. Some of the most frequently used ones include:
mother

10.1.3 The ﬁve nouns (al-√asmaa√al-xamsa á°ùªÿG AÉª°SC’G)
A subset of five of these nouns (√ab, √ax, fuu, Ham, dhuu)19 inflect for case by using
a long vowel instead of a short vowel when they are the first term of an
annexation structure or when they have a personal pronoun suffix.20
17 See Wright 1967, I:106; Lecomte 1968, 64, and Holes 1995, 127.
18 As Lecomte states (1968, 64) “Certains noms sont irréductibles à une racine verbale, et paraissent
bien constituer le glossaire fondamental de la langue concrète.”
19 In some cases, a sixth noun is included. It did not occur in the corpus consulted for this text.
20 For more information on these nouns and their inflectional paradigms, see Chapter 7, section 5ff.

11 Common nouns from quadriliteral and quinquiliteral roots: 
(√asmaa√rubaaﬁiyya wa xumaasiyya á«°SÉªNh á«YÉHQ AÉª°SCG )
11.1 Quadriliteral
A number of Arabic common nouns are quadriliteral. Some of these words are of
Arabic origin, and some of them derive from other languages. These quadriliteral
nouns rarely have corresponding verb forms. For example:

qunfudh
òoØræob
scorpion
ﬁaqrab

11.2 Reduplicated quadriliterals
Certain quadriliteral noun roots consist of reduplicated pairs of consonants. These
often refer to naturally occurring phenomena. Some of these nouns are associated
with quadriliteral verbs that denote a particular repetitive sound or motion.

12 Collective nouns, mass nouns, and unit nouns (ism al-jins ¢ùæ÷G º°SG; 
ism al-waHda IóMƒdG º°SG)
Certain Arabic nouns are terms that refer to groups of individual things in general
(grapes, bananas, trees) or to something which occurs as a “mass,” such as wood or
stone. Normally, these nouns refer to naturally occurring substances and forms of
life. In these cases, reference can also be made to an individual component of the col-
lection or the mass, and so Arabic provides a morphological way of noting this dis-
tinction through use of a “unit” noun (ism al-waHda IóMƒdG º°SG). Most mass nouns or
collective nouns are masculine singular, whereas most unit nouns (or “count”
nouns, as they are sometimes called) are feminine singular. Here are some examples:
12.1 Collective/mass term

21 Many of these nouns have a peculiarity in that in the plural, in order to fit into the Arabic broken
plural system, they actually lose a consonant, for example, ﬁankabuut /ﬁanaakib ‘spider/s’. See
Chapter 7, section 3.2.3 for more detail.

12.3 Plural of unit nouns
If there is a need to count individual nouns or units, or imply variety, the counted
noun takes a specific kind of plural that refers not to the generic grouping, but to
a number of individual units. That countable plural is often the sound feminine
plural, but it may also be a broken plural.

13 Borrowed nouns
In addition to incorporating terms from other Middle Eastern languages, over the
centuries Arabic has incorporated words from European languages, such as Latin
and Greek. In recent times, much of the borrowing has been from English and
French. Most of these borrowed nouns are considered solid-stem words, not ana-
lyzable into root and pattern.

Certain common everyday terms, such as “telephone,” “camera,” and “doctor,”
also have Arabic-based equivalents (loan translations) (e.g., haatif, √aalat taSwiir,
Tabiib, respectively), most of which have been coined by consensus of authorities
on Arabic language in the Arabic language academies in Cairo, Baghdad, and

96
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
Damascus. These academies are scholarly research institutes whose primary goal
is to maintain the accuracy, richness, and liveliness of the Arabic language
through defining standards, prescribing correct usage, and setting procedures for
the coining of new terms.
The actual choice of using the borrowed term or the Arabic term varies from
country to country, author to author, and from publication to publication. The
largest category of current loanwords is in rapidly developing technology fields
such as biology, medicine, and computer science. Efforts have been made to keep
coining Arabic-based equivalents to these technical terms, but it is a challenge to
keep pace with the amount of technical data used in the media every day. Here are
just a few terms found in current Arabic newspapers:

14 Arabic proper nouns
Proper nouns include names of people and places. These come from a variety of
sources, many of them Arabic, but some non-Arabic. 
14.1 Geographical names
Names of cities, countries, geographical features. Sometimes these include the
definite article, sometimes they do not. If the name does not have the definite
article, then it is diptote.

14.2 Personal names
Arabic personal names are a rich source of cultural information.22 Most given
names consist of one word, but some names are actually phrases that include
family information (e.g., “son of,” “mother of,” “father of,” “daughter of”) or else
reference to religious concepts (e.g., “servant of the merciful,” “light of the reli-
gion”). The structure of Arabic family names is highly complex and may include
reference to family information, place of origin (e.g., bayruutiyy q»JhÒH, ‘from
Beirut’), profession (e.g., Haddaad, OGqóM ‘blacksmith’), religion (e.g., nuur-u l-diin
øjódG Qƒf ‘light of religion’), or even physical characteristics (e.g.,√aHdab ÜóMCG
‘humpbacked’). Moreover, naming practices vary throughout the Arab world.23
Because of the absence of capitalization in Arabic script, learners of Arabic
sometimes find it challenging to distinguish proper names from ordinary adjec-
tives and nouns within a text.
14.2.1 Women’s given names
Women’s names may be Arabic or borrowed from another language; if Arabic,
they are usually nouns or adjectives denoting attractive qualities. Sometimes a
mother will be known by a matronymic, referring to her as the mother of her
eldest child.
Karima
‘generous’
kariima

14.2.1.1 MATRONYMICS: Arabic uses teknonymics – names derived from a child’s
given name. It is not uncommon for an Arab mother to acquire a female
teknonym or matronynmic once she has had a child.

15 Complex nouns, compound nouns, and compound nominals 
(naHt âëf and tarkiib Ö«côJ)
Sometimes there is a need to express semantically complex concepts in noun
form. This area of noun formation in Arabic is not as clear-cut as the other areas.
“The debate on compounding in Arabic has long been bedeviled by failure to
define terms precisely and apply consistent criteria. There are two fundamental
definitional problems: the term for compounding itself, and the status of the
components of a compound” (Emery 1988, 34).
Here three categories are distinguished: complex nouns, compound nouns, and
compound nominals (phrases). Complex nouns are created from parts of words
fused into one word. Compound nouns are created by combining two full words
into one, and compound nominals are phrases of two words that are used to refer
to one concept. In general in Arabic, the term naHt refers to complex and com-
pound nouns, whereas the term tarkiib refers to compound nominals.
15.1 Complex nouns 
Complex nouns are created through fusing two (or more) word stems into one.
This is called naHt (literally ‘chiseling’) in traditional Arabic grammar. There are
several sub-processes or variations on this procedure, and although it is not com-
mon in traditional Arabic morphology, it tends to be used in MSA for recently
coined items and for loan translations, especially technical terms.
15.1.1 Blending word segments into one word
In this process, parts of words are segmented and re-blended into a word that
combines parts of two word stems:

15.1.2 Formula nouns
This word-formation process consists of using the initial letters or syllables of a
string of words in a traditional, formulaic saying to create a quadriliteral noun,
usually ending with a taa√marbuuTa.

(‘There is no power and no strength save in God’)
15.2 Compound nouns
Compounding refers to combining two complete word stems into one syntactic
unit. The classic MSA example is the word ra√s-maal ∫Éª°SCGQ ‘capital’ formed from
conjoining the words ra√s ‘head’ and maal ‘money.’24 Another example is laa-
markaziyya ájõcôe ’ for ‘decentralization,’ from the words laa ‘no’ and markaziyya
‘centralization.’ Other examples include:

15.3 Compound nominals: (tarkiib Ö«côJ): Coherent composite phrases
Sometimes the noun concept is not expressed as a single word in Arabic, but as a
noun phrase, usually an √iDaafa, such as ﬁadam-u wujuud-in OƒLh ΩóY ‘nonexis-
tence’ or kiis-u hawaa√-in AGƒg ¢ù«c ‘airbag.’ In such cases, the dual or plural is usu-
ally made by adding the dual suffix to or pluralizing the head noun, the first
noun in the phrase.

Arabic noun types
101

Arabic participles are descriptive words derived from particular stem classes, or
Forms, of a verbal root. The active participle (ism al-faaﬁilπYÉØdG  º°SG) describes the
doer of an action and the passive participle (ism al-mafﬁuul ∫ƒ©ØŸG  º°SG) describes
the entity that receives the action, or has the action done to it.1 Arabic participles
therefore describe or refer to entities involved in an activity, process, or state.
Arabic participles are based on a distinction in voice: they are either active or
passive. This contrasts with English, where participles are based on tense (present
or past) and are used as components of compound verb forms. Arabic participles
are not used in the formation of compound verb tenses.2
In form, participles are substantives, that is they inflect as nouns or adjectives
(for case, definiteness, gender, number).3 In terms of their function, however, they
may serve as nouns, adjectives, adverbs or even verb substitutes.4 As Beeston notes
(1970, 34), “it may be impossible when quoting a word out of context to assert that
it is either [substantive or adjective], this being determinable only by the syntac-
tic context.” This is particularly true for Arabic participles. They are distinguish-
able by their form, but their syntactic functions are multiple.5
102
6
Participles: active and passive
1 According to Holes (1995, 122) “The basic difference between the two types of participle is that the
active describes the state in which the subject of the verb from which it is derived finds itself as a
result of the action or event which the verb describes, while the passive refers to the state in
which the object or complement of the verb from which it is derived finds itself after the comple-
tion of the action/event.”
2 “The participles have no fixed time reference – this has to be interpreted from the context” (Holes,
1995, 122). Also, as Kouloughli states in this context, “Il est plus éclairant de penser que le participe
actif renvoie au sujet du verbe actif alors que le participe passif renvoie, lui, au sujet du verbe passif”
(1994, 217) rather than associating either participle with any sort of temporal notion.
3 Lecomte (1968, 95) refers to Arabic participles as “the hinge between the verb and the noun”
(“la charnière entre le verbe et le nom”) because of their noun form combined with verbal qualities.
4 “The active participle can function syntactically as a noun, verb or attributive adjective . . . while
the passive participle is often used predicatively as quasi-verbal adjective to indicate the result or
present relevance of a completed action” (Holes, 1995, 122–23).
5 The description of Arabic participles varies substantially because of their wide-ranging functional
nature. For example, they are referred to by Depuydt (1997, 494) as “adjectival verb forms,” whereas
Beeston (1970, 35) states that “the participle is a noun (substantive or adjective) which like the verbal
abstract [i.e., verbal noun], matches the verb.” Arabic grammar classifies both nouns and adjectives
under the term ism ‘noun; name’ and thus refers to the participles as ism al-faaﬁil and ism al-mafﬁuul.

Participles: active and passive
103
The meanings of active and passive participles are directly related to their
descriptive nature and the verb from which they derive. However, within that
semantic range participles have a wide range of meanings. “Many words which
have the pattern of a participle contain highly specialized senses within their
semantic spectrum, in addition to the fundamental value” (Beeston 1970, 35).
The derivational rules for participles are described in greater detail in the chap-
ters on the individual forms (I–X, XI–XV, and quadriliteral).
1 Active participle (AP): (ism al-faaﬁil πYÉØdG º°SG)
When an active participle is used as a substantive to refer to the doer of an action,
often the English equivalent would be a noun ending in /-er/ or /-or/, such as ‘inspec-
tor’ or ‘teacher.’ In Arabic, the term for ‘teacher’ (mudarris ¢SqQóe), for example, is an
active participle, as is the term for ‘visitor’ (zaa√irôFGR). As a noun, when the AP refers
to or describes a human being, it takes the natural gender of the person; when refer-
ring to something abstract, it may be either masculine or feminine. Also as a noun,
it will take a particular form of the plural, which is not always predictable.
Used as an adjective, the active participle acts as a descriptive term, as, for
example, the AP jaaff ‘dry’ in the phrase jaww-un jaaff-un ‘dry air.’ It may also cor-
respond to an English adjective ending in /-ing/, such as the Form VIII AP mubtasim
‘smiling’ in the phrase bint-un mubtasimat-un, ‘a smiling girl.’ As a predicate adjec-
tive, it may serve as a verb substitute. For example, using the Form III AP musaafir
‘traveling’: huwa musaafir-un ‘He is traveling.’ 6
The active participle (AP) can be derived from any form (stem class) of Arabic
verbs, from I–X. AP’s can be derived from quadriliteral verbs as well as triliteral.
They describe the doer of the action.7 They have predictable and distinctive forms. 
1.1 Form I AP
The pattern of the active participle in Form I of the triliteral verb is CaaCic (faaﬁil
πYÉa). This pattern shows slight modification when used with irregular root types,
as described in Chapter 22, section 10.
1.1.1 Form I AP nouns
APs that refer to human beings take either a sound plural or a plural of the fuﬁﬁaal
pattern. The nonhuman AP noun may be masculine or feminine and it may take
the sound feminine plural or a broken plural, usually fawaaﬁil.
6 Note, however, the temporal and aspectual ambiguity of the AP in context. It may refer to a state of
current activity, or of having accomplished a certain activity. As Depuydt notes, “the inability to
distinguish unambiguously between simultaneity and anteriority may occasionally be an impedi-
ment to using a participle” (1997, 494).
7 In terms of meaning, note that an active participle (e.g., raaD-in ‘satisfied’ from raDiya ‘to be
satisfied’) may have an English equivalent that ends in /-ed/, but it is still an active participle.

1.1.3 Identical noun and adjective AP
It may happen that the AP for a particular verb is used both as a noun and as an adjec-
tive. In that case, they look identical in the singular, but the plurals usually differ.
1.1.3.1 AP NOUN PLURAL: The Form I AP masculine human noun takes a broken
plural of the form (fuﬁﬁaal ∫Éq©oa). The feminine human noun takes the sound
feminine plural.

1.2 Derived form active participles (II–X)
As with Form I, the derived form AP may refer to humans or nonhuman entities and
may function either as a noun or adjective, many of them doing double-duty. When
referring to or denoting human beings, the plural is either masculine sound plural
or feminine sound plural, depending on the natural gender of the head noun.
If, however, the participle noun refers to a nonhuman entity, such as muxaddir
Qpqónîoe ‘drug,’ its plural is sound feminine plural, muxaddir-aat äGQpqónîoe ‘drugs.’

1.3 Quadriliteral APs
Quadriliteral APs may function as nouns or adjectives. As with the derived-form
triliteral-based APs, quadriliteral AP nouns, when referring to human beings, take
the sound masculine or feminine plural, according to natural gender; when refer-
ring to nonhuman entities, the sound feminine plural is used.

1.4 Special functions of APs
The active participle has a wide range of syntactic functions in Arabic. As noted, it
may serve as a noun or adjective. As a predicate of an equational sentence, it may
function to indicate a verb-like action:
.ôaÉ°ùe ƒg
.¿hôFGR  ÜÓ£dG
huwa musaafir-un.
al-Tullaab-u zaa√ir-uuna.
He is traveling/has gone traveling.
The students are visiting.
.ºgÉa ÉfCG
√anaa faahim-un.
I understand (‘I am understanding’).
1.4.2 The Haal ∫ÉM construction
A particular adverbial function of active participles is their use in the Haal or cir-
cumstantial accusative construction. The active participle is used to describe addi-
tional circumstances of a verbal action, coordinating a state or circumstances
with the action denoted by the verb. The AP used in the Haal structure agrees with
the doer or sometimes with the object of the action in number and gender, but is
always in the accusative case.
.GôNCÉàe ∞°üdG πNO
daxal-a l-Saff-a muta√axxir-an.
He entered the classroom late.

Participles: active and passive
113
.ôFGõ÷G øe ør«eOÉb IôNÉÑdÉH ó∏ÑdG ÓNO
daxal-aa l-balad-a bi-l-baaxirat-i qaadim-ayni min-a l-jazaa√ir-i.

.º¡Jƒ«H ¤EG øjóFÉY Gƒ≤∏£fG
inTalaq-uu ﬁaa√id-iina √ilaa buyuut-i-him.
They departed, returning to their houses.
1.4.2.1 AP + NOUN OBJECT: If the Haal AP is from a transitive verb, it may take an
object in the accusative case:
.»Ñ«∏dG º«YõdG øe ádÉ°SQ ÓeÉM IôgÉ≤dG ¤EG OÉY
ﬁaad-a √ilaa l-qaahirat-i Haamil-an risaalat-an min-a l-zaﬁiim-i l-liibiyy-i.
He returned to Cairo carrying a letter from the Libyan leader.
.¢ù«FôdG äÉ«–  ÓbÉf áª∏c ôjRƒdG ≈≤dCGh
wa-√alqaa l-waziir-u kalimat-an naaqil-an taHiyyaat-i l-ra√iis-i.
The minister gave a speech transmitting the greetings of the president.
For further discussion of the Haal construction, see Chapter 11, section 2.3.1.
2 Passive participle (PP): ism al-mafﬁuul ∫ƒ©ØŸG º°SG
Like the active participle, the passive participle (PP) can be derived from any Form
(stem class) of Arabic verbs, from I–X, and PPs can be formed from quadriliteral
verbs as well as triliteral. In general, in order to have a passive participle a verb
should be transitive, i.e., able to take an object complement or direct object, inas-
much as PPs describe the state of the object of the action.
Passive participles acting as nouns often correspond to English nouns ending
in /-ee/ ‘employee’ (muwaZZaf ∞sXnƒoe), or they may correspond to an English past/
passive participle (e.g., maktuub Üƒàµe ‘written’).13 However, a second important
function of the PPs of derived verb forms (II–X) and quadriliterals is to function
as nouns of time and place, so the requirement for transitivity is not always met.
These include, for example, the nouns mustashfan k≈rØ°ûnàr°ùoe ‘hospital’ (X PP),
muxtabar ônÑnàrîoe ‘laboratory’ (VIII PP), and muﬁaskar ônµr°ùn©oe ‘camp’ (Quad. I PP).
2.1 Form I passive participle: mafﬁuul ∫ƒ©Øe
This form of the PP describes the result of an action, whether it functions as a
noun or an adjective. It may take a broken plural or the sound feminine plural if
13 A good description of both present and past participles in English is found in Hurford 1994,
157–60 and 195–98. Note especially his description of the contrast between the English past
participle and the Arabic passive participle, p. 159.

human males.

2.2 Derived form passive participles II–X
As nouns, these participles usually take sound plurals when referring to human
beings. When referring to nonhuman entities, the sound feminine plural is usu-
ally used. Passive participles are less likely to occur in the reflexive/reciprocal and
intransitive Forms V, VI, VII, and IX. Note that PPs as nouns of time and place are
especially frequent in Forms VII–X.
14 The singular occurs both as maxTuuT •ƒ£rîne and as maxTuuTa ánWƒ£rîne.

Five inflectional features characterize Arabic nouns: gender, humanness, num-
ber, definiteness, and case. Gender and humanness are inherent in the noun;
number and definiteness are determined semantically by the nature of the spe-
cific noun referent in context, and case is determined by the syntactic role of the
noun (e.g., subject of the verb, object of a preposition) in a clause. Every Arabic
noun in context manifests these five features, and all of these features are key
components in determining agreement with phrase and clause constituents.
For example, gender, humanness, and number are essential factors in feature
compatibility, or agreement, between the verb and its subject; whereas gender,
humanness, number, definiteness, and case are all factors in feature compatibil-
ity between nouns and their modifiers.
Arabic nouns have a base form, or stem, which is used in a word list or looked
up in a dictionary. This is also called the “citation form.” It is the bare-bones sin-
gular noun. Sometimes it is listed without any case ending, but often, in word
lists, the nouns will be in the nominative case if read out loud. For example:
ambassador
safiir-un
ÒØ°S
poetry
shiﬁr-un
ô©°T
map
xariiTat-un
á£jôN
glory
majd-un
ó›

madkhal-un

1 Gender
Arabic nouns are classified as either feminine or masculine.1 The gender category
into which a noun falls is semantically arbitrary, except where a noun refers to a
human being or other creature, when it normally conforms with natural gender.
From the point of view of word structure, or morphology, the masculine form is
the simplest and most basic shape, whereas feminine nouns usually have a suffix
that marks their gender. For the most part, gender is overtly marked, but there
are a few words whose gender is covert (see cryptomasculine and cryptofeminine
nouns) and shows up only in agreement sequences.

1 A very few nouns can be either masculine or feminine. See section 1.4 “dual gender nouns.”

1.1 Masculine nouns
This is the base category, consisting of a vast range of nouns including male
human beings and other living creatures, abstract and concrete nouns, and
proper names. As a very general rule, if an Arabic noun does not have a feminine
suffix, it is masculine.

1.1.2 Cryptomasculine nouns
A few words look overtly feminine because they are spelled with taa√marbuuTa,
but they are actually masculine. Some of these are plural or collective forms.
Some examples include:
Singular:
great scholar
ﬁallaama3
áeqÓY
Caliph
khaliifa
áØ«∏N
120
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
2 Wehr (1979) identifies the country of Jordan (al-√urdunn) as either masculine or feminine. As the
name of the River Jordan, it is strictly masculine.
3 This pattern, faﬁﬁaala ádÉq©a, is one that implies greatness or intensity. Another example is ‘globe-
trotter’ raHHaala ádÉqMQ.

1.2 Feminine nouns
Most feminine nouns are marked by the taa√marbuuTa suffix (prounounced -ah or
-a in pause form). Some of the most common categories for feminine nouns are:
female human beings, female creatures, abstract concepts, individual units of
naturally occurring classes (e.g., banana, tree), names of cities, names of most
countries, and parts of the body that come in pairs (e.g., legs, hands, eyes).

4 This is a “plural of a plural.” (See section 3.2.5 for details on this structure.)

1.2.6 Cities
Names of cities are considered feminine because the Arabic word for ‘city’ is
madiina, a feminine word. This is true for all cities, not just Arab cities.
Tunis

IQƒæŸG áæjóŸG
Mecca “the Venerable”

1.2.11 Borrowed nouns
Nouns borrowed from other languages that end with an -ah or -aa sound are usu-
ally treated as feminine:

daltaa5
ÉàdO
1.2.12 Other feminine sufﬁxes
Some nouns are marked feminine by suffixes other than taa√marbuuTa. These
endings include: √alif plus hamza (-aa√AG) or √alif Tawiila (-aa G) or √alif maqSuura
(-aa i). These endings are suffixed after the root consonants.6 For example:
desert (root: S-H-r)
SaHraa√
AGôë°U
remembrance (root: dh-k-r)
dhikraa
iôcP
universe; world (root: d-n-y)
dunyaa
É«fO
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
123
5 As in daltaa l-niil-i ‘the Nile Delta.’
6 Note that there are also a number of masculine nouns that end with √alif plus hamza, √alif Tawiila,
or √alif maqSuura. The √alif ending in those instances represents the final defective consonant of
the lexical root and is not an affix. Some of these masculine nouns include:
song (root: gh-n-y)
ghinaa√
AÉæZ
meaning (root: ﬁ-n-y)
maﬁnan

1.3 Natural gender nouns
Many nouns that refer to human beings or other living creatures have both a mas-
culine and a feminine form. They vary in gender depending on the nature of the
referent, just as English has pairs of words such as “host” and “hostess.” The gen-
eral rule is that the masculine is the base form and the feminine is denoted by the
addition of taa√marbuuTa. Examples of some of these include:
king/queen
malik/malika
áµ∏e/∂∏e
artist (m/f)
fannaan/fannaana
áfÉqæa/¿Éqæa
ambassador/ambassadress
safiir/safiira

1.4 Dual gender nouns
A very small number of Arabic nouns are either masculine or feminine.7 They can
be treated syntactically as either one, although feminine agreement predomi-
nates in the data gathered for this study. There are not many nouns in this group,
but some of them are fairly frequent:
market
suuq
¥ƒ°S
spirit
ruuH
ìhQ
road; path
Tariiq

AÉª°S

á«Hô©dG ìhôdG

Ió«L ∫ÉM ‘
2 Humanness
A unique and important morpho-semantic feature of Arabic nouns is humanness,
that is, whether or not they refer to human beings. This is a crucial grammatical
point for predicting certain kinds of plural formation and for purposes of agree-
ment with other components of a phrase or clause. The grammatical criterion of
humanness applies only to nouns in the plural.
2.1 Agreement
Agreement with nouns in the plural depends on whether the noun refers to
human beings.
2.1.1 Nonhuman referent
If a plural noun refers to nonhuman entities, be they creatures or inanimate things,
it takes feminine singular agreement. This is sometimes referred to as “deflected”
agreement.8 This applies to agreement with verbs, adjectives, and also pronouns.
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
125

2.1.3.1 GROUPS OF HUMANS AS ABSTRACTIONS: Sometimes, although the noun

2.1.3.2 ‘PEOPLE’ WORDS: shaﬁb Ö©°T AND naas ¢SÉf
(1)
shaﬁb Ö©°T: The word shaﬁb ‘people’ although semantically plural, is usu-
ally treated as masculine singular, as a collective noun. Its plural, shuﬁuub,
‘peoples’ is treated as a nonhuman plural with feminine singular
agreement:

naas ¢SÉf: The word naas ‘people’ has inconsistent agreement patterns.
From the triliteral root √-n-s, and related to the words ¿É°ùfEG √insaan ‘human
being,’ and á°ùfBG √aanisa ‘young lady,’ it refers to people or folk in general.
Sometimes its agreement patterns follow the rules for words referring to
human beings, i.e., the agreement is masculine plural; other times (even
in the same text) it may be treated as an abstraction and the agreement is
feminine singular:
(2.1)
Plural agreement:

Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
127
9 The agreement here is not with the feminine form of the number, since it is actually masculine
(agreeing via reverse gender with the singular of √ashxaaS, shaxS).

(2.2)
Feminine singular agreement:
.á«JÉÑf QOÉ°üe øe ’EG ájòZCG πcCÉJ ’ ¢SÉædG øe Òãch

2.2.3 Human/nonhuman homonyms
Sometimes two nouns may look identical (i.e., they are homonyms) but have dif-
ferent meanings, one human and one nonhuman, and so the plural is different,

3 Number
Arabic nouns are marked for three different kinds of number: singular, dual, and
plural. Because Arabic has a special morphological category for the dual, plural in
Arabic refers to three or more. The singular is considered the base form of the
noun, and the dual and plural are extensions of that form in various ways.
3.1 The dual (al-muthannaa ≈æãŸG)
Arabic has a separate number category for two of anything. Instead of using the
number “two” (ithnaani ¿ÉæKEG or ithnataani ¿ÉàæKEG) plus the plural noun, as does
English (“two hands”), Arabic uses a dual suffix on the singular stem to mark the
noun as being dual (e.g., yad-aani ‘two hands’). The suffix has two case forms, the
case being signaled by the change of the long vowel in the suffix from /-aa-/ to /-ay-/:
-aani
(nominative)
-ayni
(genitive/accusative)
Nominative:
.¿GÒØ°S π°Uh
waSal-a safiir-aani.
Two ambassadors arrived.
Genitive:
øjÒØ°S ÚH
bayn-a safiir-ayni
between two ambassadors
Accusative:
.øjÒØ°ùdG GhQGR
zaar-uu l-safiir-ayni.
They visited the two ambassadors.
3.1.1 Dual with taa√marbuuTa
When the dual suffix is added to a noun ending in taa√marbuuTa, the taa√marbu-
uTa is no longer the final letter in the word and it turns into regular taa√.
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case

3.1.2 Dual plus waaw or yaa√
When the dual suffix is added to certain words that are biliteral in origin, or to
words in the defective declension, a waaw or yaa√is inserted before the dual suffix:10
¿GƒHCG
¿GƒNCG
¿É«eÉﬁ

¿É«¡≤e
¿É«Ø°ûà°ùe
qaaDiy-aani
maqhay-aani
mustashfay-aani
two judges
two cafés
two hospitals
3.1.3 Deﬁniteness in the dual
One of the features of the dual suffix is that it shows no distinction between def-
inite and indefinite. It cannot be marked for nunation.11
two smugglers
muharrib-aani
¿ÉHqô¡e
the two smugglers
al-muharrib-aani
¿ÉHqô¡ŸG
with two smugglers
maﬁ-a muharrib-ayni
ÚHqô¡e ™e
with the two smugglers
maﬁ-a l-muharrib-ayni
ÚHqô¡ŸG ™e
3.1.4 Nuun-deletion in √iDaafa
If a dual noun is the first term of an √iDaafa or annexation structure, the nuun plus
kasra (/-ni/ p¿) of the dual suffix is deleted. Thus, -aani becomes -aa and -ayni
becomes -ay.12
130
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
10 Whether the additional consonant is waaw or yaa√depends on the root consonants and on deriva-
tional morphology. See Abboud and McCarus 1983, Part 2: 14–17.
11 The dual suffixes -aani and -ayni as well as the sound masculine plural suffixes -uuna and -iina both
terminate with the consonant nuun, followed by a short vowel, and this feature behaves to a cer-
tain extent as a form of nunation (being deleted if the noun has a possessive pronoun suffix, for
instance). Additional nunation is not used for these suffixes.
12 In Arabic annexation structures, there is a general prohibition on the first term (the muDaaf ),
against noun suffixes ending with an -n sound. This applies to nunation (indefiniteness marking),
to the dual suffix, and to the sound masculine plural.

Ωƒf »àaôZ øe áfƒµe á≤°T

3.1.5 Nuun-deletion with pronoun sufﬁx
The same process occurs when a noun in the dual gets a possessive pronoun
suffix. The -ni of the dual suffix is deleted and the possessive pronoun suffix is
attached directly to the -aa or -ay of the dual suffix. For example:
¬jój ÚH
¬«ÑfÉL øe
bayn-a yad-ay-hi
min jaanib-ay-hi
in front of him (‘between his two hands’)
from its two sides
.É¡«YGQP íàØJ
.√ÉHhóæe π°Uh
ta-ftaH-u dhiraaﬁ-ay-haa.
waSal-a manduub-aa-hu.
She opens her arms.
His two delegates arrived.
3.1.6 Dual agreement
When a noun in the dual is modified by an adjective, is referred to by a pronoun,
or is the subject of a following verb, then these form classes conform to the dual
inflection as well. Thus, the concept of dual is present not only in nouns, but in
adjectives, pronouns and verbs. These are discussed separately under each of the
form-class headings, but here are some examples:
.¿Éª¡e ¿ÉYƒ°Vƒe ∑Éæg

131
13 In this and the following phrases the -ay dual ending is given a “helping vowel” kasra because of
the consonantal nature of the -y ending on the dual suffix -ay, in order to help pronunciation and
liaison with the following word. (See Wright 1967, I:21 on this point.)
14 A traditional title of the ruler of Saudi Arabia.

3.2 The Plural (al-jamﬁ™ª÷G)
Arabic nouns form their plurals in three ways. Two of these are “external” plurals
consisting of suffixes added to the singular stem (the sound feminine and sound
masculine plurals). The third way of pluralizing occurs inside the noun stem itself
(the “broken” or internal plural), shifting the arrangement of vowels, and some-
times inserting an extra consonant or two. To add to this diversity, a noun may
have two or three (or more) alternative plurals.
3.2.1 The sound feminine plural ( jamﬁmu√annath saalim ⁄É°S  åfDƒe  ™ªL)
This form of plural is very common and applies to an extensive range of Arabic
noun classes, both human and nonhuman. It consists of a suffix -aat (äG-) attached
to the singular stem of the noun. Note that when this suffix is attached to a noun
that has taa√marbuuTa in the singular, it replaces the taa√marbuuTa:

3.2.1.1 INFLECTION OF THE SOUND FEMININE PLURAL: The sound feminine plural
suffix has a special declension of its own. It inflects for definiteness (definite and
indefinite) and for case, but only shows two case variations instead of the normal
three: / -u/ or /-un/ for nominative and /-i/ or /-in/ for genitive/accusative. The sound
feminine plural ending never takes fatHa / -a/. For inflectional paradigms see
section 5.4.2.1, subsection (3), in this chapter.
Nominative:

sharik-aat-un
läÉcô°T

al-sharik-aat-u

3.2.1.2 VARIANTS: BUFFER SOUNDS INSERTED BEFORE SOUND FEMININE PLURAL
SUFFIX: Some nouns insert a waaw or yaa√or a haa√to the noun stem before
affixing the /-aat/ ending. Most of these nouns end in the singular with a vowel or
√alif-hamza, but some end with taa√or taa√marbuuTa:
(1)
waaw insertion:
(1.1)
Two common bi-consonantal nouns insert waaw before the -aat ending:
sister/s
√uxt/ √axa-w-aat äGƒNCG/âNCG
year/s
sana/sana-w-aat äGƒæ°S/áæ°S
(1.2)
Certain borrowed words ending in √alif Tawiila take the sound feminine plu-
ral with waaw as buffer between the two √alifs. Note that even though the
referents of these nouns are human males, the plural is sound feminine.

äGhÉ°TÉH/É°TÉH
pope/s
baabaa/baabaa-w-aatbaaba-w-aat
äGƒHÉH  äGhÉHÉH/ÉHÉH
(1.3)
Nouns ending in the suffix -aa√often drop the final hamza and add a waaw
between the stem and suffix:15
green (f.)/greens
xaDraa√/xaDraa-w-aat
äGhGô°†N/AGô°†N

SaHraa√/SaHraa-w-aat
äGhGôë°U/AGôë°U
parrot/s
babbaghaa√/babbaghaa-w-aat
äGhÉ¨qÑH/AÉ¨qÑH
(1.4)
Nouns ending in √alif plus taa√marbuuTa usually shorten √alif to fatHa, and
add a waaw:
channel/s; canal/s
qanaat/qana-w-aat
äGƒæb/IÉæb
prayer/s
Salaat/ Sala-w-aat
äGƒ∏°U/IÓ°U
(2)
yaa√insertion: Nouns that end with with √alif maqSuura shorten the √alif
to fatHa and insert yaa√before the sound feminine plural suffix:
memory/ies
dhikraa/dhikra-y-aat
äÉjôcP/iôcP
sweet/s
Halwaa/Halwa-y-aat
äÉjƒ∏M/iƒ∏M
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
133
15 Note that if the hamza in the -aa√ending is part of the root, then the hamza is not deletable, as in:
√ijraa√aat äGAGôLEG.

haa√insertion: The word √umm, ‘mother’ inserts a haa√preceded by fatHa
before suffixing the sound feminine plural:17
mother/s
√umm/ √umm-ah-aat
äÉ¡qeCG/qΩCG
Borrowed words ending with a long vowel (especially -uu) often insert haa√as
a buffer before the /-aat/ suffix in order to avoid two long vowels coming
together:
casino/s
kaaziinuu/kaaziinuu-h-aat
äÉgƒæjRÉc/ƒæjRÉc

3.2.1.3 WHERE THE SOUND FEMININE PLURAL IS USED: The following categories
describe the types of nouns which make their plural using the sound feminine
plural suffix -aat. Some categories are general, like number 1, and some are
specific, like 3 and 4. In some cases there is more than one form of the plural. This
is by no means an exhaustive list, but covers major categories.

Vowel variation: Feminine nouns ending with taa√marbuuTa or taa√that
have sukuun on the second radical, often use the sound feminine plural
with a slight internal vowel change, usually a shift to an additional vowel
inserted after the second radical. When the original short vowel is fatHa or

‘source, origin, original version, essence.’ See Wehr 1979 for examples and details.

the Damma may be copied or there may be a change to fatHas.

Nouns referring strictly to female human beings. Many of these nouns are

groups.18

Verbal nouns from derived forms II–X of triliteral roots and also from
Forms I–IV of quadriliteral roots. These verbal nouns all take the sound

Names of the months: There are three sets of names of the months used
in Arabic: two sets for the solar calendar (one based on Semitic names and
one on borrowed European names) and one for the lunar Muslim
calendar.23 All months make their plural with -aat.

3.2.2 The sound masculine plural ( jamﬁmudhakkar saalim ⁄É°S ôcòe ™ªL)
The sound masculine plural is much more restricted in occurrence than the
sound feminine plural because, almost without exception, it only occurs on
nouns and adjectives referring to male human beings or mixed groups of male
and female human beings.25
3.2.2.1 INFLECTION OF THE SOUND MASCULINE PLURAL: This type of plural takes
the form of a suffix that attaches to the singular noun (or adjective): -uuna
(nominative) or -iina (genitive/accusative).
(1)
Case: The sound masculine plural shows overtly only two case inflections
instead of three. Note that the long vowel in the suffix (-uu- or -ii-) is the case
marker, and is what changes when the case changes.26 The short vowel end-
ing ( fatHa) (-a) remains the same in both the nominative and the
genitive/accusative. This fatHa is not a case ending, but rather part of the
spelling of the suffix. In pause form it is not pronounced. Examples:
observers (nom.)
muraaqib-uuna
¿ƒÑbGôe
observers (gen./acc.)
muraaqib-iina
ÚÑbGôe
surgeons (nom.)
jarraaH-uuna
¿ƒMGqôL
surgeons (gen./acc.)
jarraaH-iina
ÚMGqôL
(2)
Definiteness: One of the features of the sound masculine plural suffix is
that, like the dual suffix, there is no distinction between definite and
indefinite:
assistants
musaaﬁid-uuna
¿hóYÉ°ùe
the assistants
al-musaaﬁid-uuna
¿hóYÉ°ùŸG

maﬁa musaaﬁid-iina

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
25 Exceptions are very few and include, for example,√arD/ ¢VQCG-√araDuun ¿ƒ°VQCG - ‘land/s.’ The noun
√arD has a more common plural, however: √araaD-inm¢VGQCG.
26 Arab grammarians consider the long vowel of the sound masculine plural as the inflectional
vowel, the one that indicates case.

3.2.2.2 Nuun-DELETION:
(1)
As first term of √iDaafa: A distinctive feature of the sound masculine plural
suffix, like the dual suffix, is that because its final consonant is a nuun, the
nuun and its vowel, fatHa, are deleted if the noun is the first term of an
√iDaafa (annexation structure).27 The long vowel of the suffix (-uu- or -ii-) is
then left as the final element of the word.

3.2.2.3 WHERE THE SOUND MASCULINE PLURAL IS USED: The following categories
show the types of nouns which form their plural using the sound masculine
suffix. Some categories are general, like number 1, and some are specific, like 3
and 4. This is not an exhaustive list, but covers major categories.
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case

If a plural is needed for these terms (“forties,” “fifties,” the sound femi-
nine plural is suffixed to the genitive/accusative form of the number (see
above 3.2.1.3(7)). For more on numerals, see Chapter 15.
3.2.3 The broken plural ( jamﬁal-taksiir Ò°ùµàdG ™ªL)
The broken or internal plural is highly characteristic of Arabic nouns and adjec-
tives. It involves a shift of vowel patterns within the word stem itself, as in English
“man/men,” “foot/feet” or “mouse/mice.” It may also involve the affixation of an
extra consonant (usually hamza or waaw). The relationship between singular nouns
and their broken plural forms relates to syllable and stress patterns, so that there
is often a characteristic rhythm to the singular/plural doublet when said aloud.
The structure and regularities of the Arabic broken plural system have been
the subject of research in morphological theory over the past fifteen years, and
considerable progress has been made in developing theories to identify and
account for the underlying regularities in the broken plural system, the most
144
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

prominent of those theories being templatic morphology and prosodic
morphology.29
For nonnative speakers of Arabic, learning which nouns take which plurals can
take some time, but if singulars and plurals are learned as doublets and grouped
together, sound patterns of vowel–consonant distribution become evident and, at
least to some extent, ascertainable. The most common broken plural patterns are
listed here under triptote (fully inflected) and diptote (partially inflected) cate-
gories. (For the nature of diptote inflection see section 5.4.2.2 in this chapter.)
Wherever possible, specific vowel patterns are identified. 
Where patterns are more general, consonant–vowel structures are also given,
using the convention that the symbol V stands for any vowel and VV for any long
vowel. The letter C stands for any consonant.30
3.2.3.1 TRIPTOTE PATTERN PLURALS ( jamﬁmuﬁrabÜô©e ™ªL): These broken plural
patterns are fully inflectable. They show all three case markers and can take
nunation when indefinite.

Broken plural patterns with internal vowel change only:

29 See, for example, McCarthy and Prince 1990a and 1990b, Paoli 1999, and Ratcliffe 1990. In
particular, see Ratcliffe 1998 for an extensive analysis of Arabic broken plurals within comparative
Semitic. As he describes it, it is “a historical and comparative study of a portion of the nominal
morphology of Arabic and other Semitic languages on the basis of a fresh theoretical approach to
non-concatenative or ‘root and pattern’ morphology” (1998, 1). As to the abundance of broken
plural forms, Lecomte notes (1968, 72–73): “Le problème des pluriels internes est fort complexe, et
rebelle à toute explication décisive. On notera toutefois que la fixation a été opérée par les
lexicographes anciens aux IIe et IIIe siècles de l’Hegire à la suite de minutieuses enquêtes dans les
tribus. Les différences dialectales constitutent donc une des clés du problème. Elles expliquent en
tout cas pourquoi les dictionnaires peuvent signaler plusieurs pluriels pour un même mot.”
30 For an extensive list and discussion of broken plural patterns, see Wright 1967, I:199–234. For
further lists and analysis of broken plurals, see also Abboud and McCarus 1983, Part 2: 267–76;
Blachère and Gaudefroy Demombynes 1975, 166–99; Cowan 1964, 23–28 and 200–202; Fleisch

32 The plural √ashyaa√‘things’ is diptote despite the fact that the final hamza is part of the root. See
section 5.4.2.2 in this chapter for further discussion of diptotes and diptote patterns.
33 By virtue of phonological rules that prevent the sequence /-yw-/ in *√aywaam, the plural form
becomes √ayyaam, with assimilation of the waaw to the yaa√. Likewise, *√a√laaf is realized as √aalaaf
in order to avoid the sequence /√a√/. Other plurals of this pattern include ‘literature’ √adab/

used primarily with words that have four consonants in the singular,
but can also be used for plurals of words with three consonants in the
singular. It has a number of variations, as follows:

faﬁaalil plural pattern is used with nouns from defective roots, or
nouns with defective plural patterns, it ends with two kasras when it is

3.2.5 Plural of the plural: ( jamﬁal-jamﬁ™ª÷G ™ªL)
Occasionally a noun will have a plural form that can itself be made plural. It is
not clear whether there is a semantic difference between simple plural and plural
of plural or if the use is purely stylistic choice. Some instances of plural of plural
include:
hand/s
yad / √ayd-in/√ayaad-in
mOÉjCG/mójCG/ój

jurH / juruuH/ juruuHaat

haram/ √ahraam/√ahraamaat
äÉeGôgCG/ΩGôgCG/Ωôg
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
155

In the following case, the plural of the plural has a semantic implication: the
first plural is straightforward, but the plural of the plural implies distinction as
well as plurality: ‘distinctive men, men of importance.’
man/men/men of distinction
rajul/rijaal/rijaalaat

4 Deﬁniteness and indeﬁniteness
Arabic substantives may be marked for definiteness or indefiniteness. There is a
definite article in Arabic, but it is not an independent word, it is a prefix al-. The
indefinite marker (“a” or “an” in English) is not a separate word in Arabic. It is a
suffix, -n, referred to technically as “nunation” (from the name of the letter/sound
nuun). Thus, in Arabic, the definiteness marker is attached to the beginning of a
word and the indefiniteness marker is attached to the end of a word. They are, of
course, mutually exclusive.
4.1 Deﬁniteness
Specifying definiteness, or determination, is a way of specifying or restricting the
meaning of a noun. Arabic nouns are determined or made definite in three ways:
(1)
By prefixing the definite article /al-/;
(2)
By using the noun as first term of an √iDaafa (annexation structure);
(3)
By suffixing a possessive pronoun to the noun.
4.1.1 The deﬁnite article /al-/:
This function word has several important features:38
4.1.1.1 IT IS A PREFIX: It is not an independent word, it is a prefix, or proclitic
particle. It is affixed to the beginning of a word and written as part of it.

õÑÿG
the pyramids

al-faraH
ìôØdG
4.1.1.2 IT IS SPELLED WITH hamzat al-waSl: Although spelled with √alif-laam, and
most often transliterated as “al-,” the √alif in this word is not a vowel and is
therefore not pronounced; rather, it is a seat for a hamza and a short vowel -a
( fatHa) which is pronounced when the word is utterance-initial.
When the definite article is not the first word in an utterance, then the hamza
drops out, the /a/ vowel is replaced by the vowel that ends the previous word, and
156

38 For more on the definite and indefinite articles, see Chapter 2, section 8.

there is no break between the words. There is, instead, a liaison, or smooth tran-
sition from one word to the next.39

4.1.1.3 ASSIMILATION OF laam: The nature of the first letter of a noun or
adjective determines the pronunciation of /al-/. The letters of the Arabic alphabet
are divided into two sections, one section whose members assimilate the /l/ sound
and another section whose members allow the full pronunciation of /l/ of the
definite article. See also Chapter 2, section 8.1.2.
(1)
Sun letters (Huruuf shamsiyya á«°ùª°T  ±hôM): Certain sounds, or letters,
when they begin a word, cause the laam of the definite article to assimi-
late or be absorbed into them in pronunciation (but not in writing). When
this assimilation happens, it has the effect of doubling the first letter of
the word. That letter is then written with a shadda, or doubling marker,
and is pronounced more strongly. The list is:

4.1.2 Uses of the deﬁnite article
The definite article is used in the following ways:
4.1.2.1 PREVIOUS SPECIFICATION: To specify a noun or noun phrase previously
referred to or understood by the reader or hearer. For example:
º«bCG …òdG ójó÷G õcôŸG
.Ö©∏ŸG ‘ óLh
al-markaz-u l-jadiid-u lladhii √uqiim-a
wujid-a fii l-malﬁab-i.

It was found in the playground.
.áª∏µdG »°ùf ¬fCG ∑QOCG
√adrak-a √anna-hu nasiy-a l-kalimat-a.
He realized that he had forgotten the word.
4.1.2.2 GENERIC USE: Here the definite article is used to specify a noun in
general terms. In English, the generic use of the noun often omits the definite
article, for example, “life is beautiful,” “squirrels like nuts,” “elephants never
forget,” “seeing is believing.” Sometimes, also, in English, an indefinite article is
used to refer to something in general: “a noun is a part of speech.” In Arabic, the
definite article is used when referring to something in general.

This includes names of places in the Arab world and elsewhere.

4.1.3 Deﬁniteness through annexation (√iDaafa áaÉ°VEG)
A noun can become definite through being added or annexed to another (Arabic:
√iDaafa ‘addition; annexation’ also called the “genitive construct”). The first term
of an annexation structure cannot have the definite article because it is made def-
inite by means of its annexation to another noun. When the annexing noun is
definite, or a proper noun, the whole phrase is considered definite.

The √iDaafa is a very common syntactic structure in Arabic with a wide range of
meanings, reflecting relationships of belonging, identification, and possession.
For more detail and examples, see Chapter 8.
4.1.4 Deﬁniteness through pronoun sufﬁx
A third way for a noun to be made definite is to suffix a possessive pronoun. The
pronoun is attached to a noun after the case marker. Note that a noun cannot
have both the definite article and a pronoun suffix: they are mutually exclusive
(just as one would not have “the my house” in English). Because a noun with a
160

40 The first noun in the annexation structure looks definite because it does not have nunation, but it
is not definite. For example, if it is modified, the adjective is indefinite:

4.2 Indeﬁniteness
4.2.1 Writing and pronunciation: nunation (tanwiin øjƒæJ)
Indefiniteness as a noun feature is usually marked by a suffixed /-n/ sound, which
is written in a special way as a variation of the case-marking short vowel at the
end of a word.41 The technical term for this is “nunation” in English, and tanwiin
øjƒæJ in Arabic. The suffixed /-n/ sound is not written by using the Arabic letter
nuun. Instead, it is signaled by writing the short case-marking vowel twice. There-
fore, the names of the nunation markers are:

161
41 See also Chapter 2, section 8.2.
42 The exception to this is the accusative indefinite suffix, -an, which is written into the script with
an √alif and two fatHas. See section 4.2.1.5(2) for further description.

Whereas the definite article is visible in Arabic script, the indefinite marker
normally is not, since it attaches itself to the inflectional short vowel suffixes.42
In general, the nominative (Dammataani) and genitive (kasrataani) forms of
nunation are not pronounced in pause form. The accusative (fatHataani), however,
is often pronounced, even in pause form, especially in common spoken Arabic
adverbial phrases:

does not take fatHa or fatHataani; the genitive and accusative forms are identical:

4.2.1.5 NOTES ABOUT NUNATION: There are several things to note about the
writing and pronunciation of nunation:
(1)
First, the nominative, Dammataan, is more often written as a Damma with
a “tail” or flourish, 
rather than two separate Dammas

lIôNÉH

l¢SôL
(2)
Second, the accusative, fatHataan, is often accompanied by an √alif. This
√alif is a spelling convention and is not pronounced. It is considered to be
a chair or seat for the two fatHas to perch on. It is visible in Arabic script.

If a word in the accusative ends with a taa√marbuuTa, or a hamza, or pre-
ceded by √alif, then the √alif “chair” is not used and the fatHataan perch
right on top of the hamza or taa√marbuuTa:

Helping vowel with nunation: Because nunation causes the pronuncia-
tion of a word to end with a consonant (/-n-/), there may be a need for a
helping vowel after the nunation if, for instance, the nunated word is fol-
lowed directly by a noun or adjective with the definite article thus creat-
ing a consonant cluster. That helping vowel is pronounced as kasra (/-i-/),
but it is not written. Wright, in discussing this form of helping vowel,
gives the example:

(4)
Words that do not take nunation: There are some words that do not take
nunation when they are indefinite. This includes words that fall into the
diptote declension (see section 5.4.2.2. in this chapter), words that end with
the sound masculine plural (-uuna or -iina) (see section 5.4.2.1., subsection
(2) in this chapter), words that end with the dual suffix (-aani and -ayni) and
invariable words (see section 5.4.5. in this chapter).

4.2.2 Uses of the indeﬁnite
4.2.2.1 TO EXPRESS NON-DEFINITE STATUS: Nunation is used on Arabic nouns and
adjectives to mark indefinite status. An adjective modifying an indefinite noun is
also indefinite.

4.2.2.2 MASCULINE PROPER NAMES: A perhaps unusual (to English speakers)
function of the indefinite marker is its use on many Arabic masculine given
names. They are semantically definite, but morphologically indefinite. This is so
because many of these Arabic names are derived from adjectives which describe
particular attributes. Nonetheless, given names are considered definite and
agreeing words are definite.

Nunation is not marked on all masculine names, only those derived from Ara-
bic adjectives or participles. For example, the names √aHmad, √ibraahiim, sulay-
maan, and yuusuf are diptote and do not take nunation.44 Most female names are
also diptote and do not take nunation.45
4.2.2.3 ADVERBIAL ACCUSATIVE EXPRESSIONS: Adverbial expressions in Arabic
tend to be in the accusative case, and quite often in the indefinite accusative. It is
therefore common to see the indefinite accusative marker when reading Arabic
texts. Another characteristic of the indefinite accusative marker, especially with
adverbs, is that it is pronounced as well as written, whereas the nominative and
genitive forms of nunation are not normally pronounced in spoken Arabic.46
The adverbial use of the accusative is described in greater detail in the section
on the accusative case, but here are some examples in the indefinite accusative
(see also 4.2.1 above):

5 Case inﬂection
Arabic nouns, participles, adjectives and, to some extent, adverbs have word-final
(or desinential) inflection. That is, they are marked for case, which indicates the
syntactic function of the word and its relationship with other words in the sen-
tence.47 In Arabic, the term for case marking is (√iﬁraab ÜGôYEG).48 In respect to case
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
165
44 For the reasons behind this see section 5.4.2.2 on the diptote declension.
45 There are a few exceptions. The feminine name hind-un, for example, may take nunation. But this
is exceptional. 
46 Pronunciation of nunation at the end of a word is apparently still heard in some rural vernacular
forms of Arabic. For the most part, the only form of nunated ending that is regularly pronounced
in spoken MSA or in the urban vernaculars is the accusative (/-an/).
47 Blake (1994, 1) defines case as follows: “Case is a system of marking dependent nouns for the type
of relationship they bear to their heads. Traditionally the term refers to inflectional marking, and,
typically, case marks the relationship of a noun to a verb at the clause level or of a noun to a
preposition, postposition or another noun at the phrase level.”
48 The Arabic term √iﬁraab ÜGôYEG refers to desinential inflection in general: not only case markers on
nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, but also mood markers (indicative, subjunctive, jussive) on verbs.
Arab grammarians classify case marking and mood marking together in one category, and give
them similar labels. For more on this see Bohas, Guillaume, and Kouloughli 1990, 53-55, and
Ryding 1993.

inflection, Arabic resembles some European languages such as German, Russian,
and Latin.
Arabic has three cases: nominative (rafﬁ™aQ), genitive ( jarr qôL), and accusative
(naSb Ö°üf). As a general rule, these cases are indicated by short vowel suffixes:
-u (Damma) for nominative, -i (kasra) for genitive, and -a ( fatHa) for accusative. How-
ever, these short vowels are not the only ways to mark case. Words inflected for
case fall into several declensions or inflection classes and therefore inflect for
these three cases in different ways. 
Case marking is placed at the end of a noun or adjective. If a noun or adjective
is definite, then the case-marking short vowel is suffixed at the very end of the
word. If a noun or adjective is indefinite, the case marker is followed by an
indefinite marker (a final /-n/ sound, “nunation” in English and tanwiin in Arabic),
indicated in writing by the convention of doubling the short vowel case ending,
e.g., o o -un / ; m / -in/ ;  kG / -an / (see above).
Case is one of the most challenging inflectional categories in MSA for several
reasons. First of all, it depends on rules of syntax for its implementation, and
second, in many ways it is redundant. Moreover, colloquial forms of Arabic do
not have case marking, so case is used only in written Arabic.49 Even for native
speakers of Arabic, therefore, the case system is learned through formal
instruction.
5.1 Pronunciation and writing conventions
The Arabic case-ending system consists primarily of short, word-final vowels,
which are invisible in conventional written Arabic texts.50 This can hinder clear-cut
understanding of case inflections and sentential relations. Furthermore, because
the nature of these case marking vowels is dependent on a word’s function in a
sentence, they vary from one context to another, and only if one knows the rules
of grammatical usage can one ascertain what the noun-final case markers are for
any particular sentence. 
The Arabic case-marking system, then, remains mostly hidden from view in
written texts and is apparent only when the text is read out loud with complete
166
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
49 This is true for the colloquial variants of spoken Arabic and even for educated spoken Arabic or
formal spoken Arabic. Case does not play a significant role in these forms of the language.
50 Exceptions to this general rule include case marking that occurs as long vowels in, for example,
the dual suffixes (-aani/ -ayni), the sound masculine plural suffixes (-uuna/-iina) and the “five
nouns” that inflect, under certain conditions, with long vowels (see section 5.4.1.c.). Another par-
tial exception is the word-final √alif that appears in written Arabic script on many words as a seat
for fatHataan, the indefinite accusative marker (e.g., √axiir-an (‘finally’), GÒNCG, √aHyaan-an (‘some-
times’) ÉfÉ«MCG). This particular form of case ending (the indefinite accusative ending in -an) is
often pronounced, even in pause form.

pronunciation of all vowels (i.e., in “full” form).51 The ability to use and pronounce
accurate case marking in written or literary Arabic is not an automatic skill but a
rigorous task, even for educated native speakers. It is also therefore the mark of a
well-educated or learned individual. The case-marking rules are used and under-
stood primarily by scholars and specialists in Arabic grammar, linguistics, scrip-
ture, and literature.52 Learners of Arabic as a foreign language need to know the
basic rules of word order, inflection, agreement, and governance in order to make
sense of Arabic texts. The degree to which they need knowledge of explicit case
marking rules depends on the structure and goals of particular academic pro-
grams, and on the goals of individual learners.53
In this book the case-marking system is described in some detail, but not
exhaustively. For those who wish to delve more deeply into Arabic morphosyntax,
Wright (1967) is recommended as are Hasan (1987) especially volumes II and IV;
Fleisch (1961, 268–82), Beeston (1970, 51–55), and Cowan (1958). For a recent theo-
retical study of case in general, a good reference is Blake 1994.
5.2 Case marking and declensions
Arabic case marking takes place either as a short vowel suffix or as a modification
of a long vowel suffix. Cases are marked on nouns, adjectives, and certain adverbs.
The categories described below show the most common instances of particular
case functions in MSA. It has not been traditional to designate Arabic nouns as
belonging to particular declensions or inflectional classes, except to refer to them
as “triptote” (showing three different inflectional markers, one for each case) or
“diptote” (showing only two different inflectional markers when indefinite, nom-
inative, and genitive/accusative). However, for reference purposes here, each
inflectional type is classified into a separate, numbered declension.54
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
167
51 In reading written Arabic aloud, some narrators read most of the words in pause form, omitting
desinential inflections. News broadcasters, for example, vary in their formality and in the degree
to which they use case-marking in narrating news items. Some seldom use it; others use it par-
tially, and some use it more consistently. Officials giving formal speeches also vary in the degree
to which they pronounce case marking. Only in formal academic and religious contexts is pronun-
ciation of full desinential inflection considered necessary or appropriate. 
52 Holes (1995, 142) states: “As a means of syntactic disambiguation in modern written Arabic, case
plays almost no role (inevitably so, since in most cases it is carried by short vowel distinctions
which are unmarked), and, despite the importance which the indigenous tradition of grammati-
cal description and language pedagogy attaches to it, it is clear, when one examines ancient tex-
tual material, that the functional load of the case endings was no higher in the Classical period
than it is now.”
53 See, for example, the article by Khaldieh (2001) titled: “The relationship between knowledge of
iﬁraab, lexical knowledge, and reading comprehension of nonnative readers of Arabic.”
54 It should be understood that these declensional identifications are not standardized; they are
named as such in this book to facilitate description and reference.

5.2.1 Shift of declension
In Indo-European languages a noun usually belongs to a particular inflectional
class or declension in both the singular and the plural. However, in Arabic, the
number suffixes (duals and sound plurals) and even the internal broken plural
pattern, can shift a noun into a different inflectional class. The criteria for iden-
tifying declensions depend on the nature of the noun stem and also whether or
not it includes a dual or plural number inflection.
5.3 Case categories and their functions
The type of case marking on a noun or adjective depends on its form and func-
tion. That is, it is determined by the inflectional class (declension) of the word
involved and the role of the word within a specific sentence or clause (which case
is appropriate under the circumstances). For example, in a sentence such as:
.nÚØXƒŸG ™e kÉYÉªàLG oôjóŸG nó≤Y
ﬁaqad-a l-mudiir-u jtimaaﬁ-an maﬁ-a l-muwaZZaf-iina.
The director held a meeting with the employees.
There are three nouns in this sentence: al-mudiir-u ‘director, manager,’ ijtimaaﬁ-an
‘meeting,’ and al-muwaZZaf-iina ‘the employees.’ Each noun is marked for its case
role in the sentence.
The first noun, mudiir, belongs to the triptote declension or declension one and
is marked for definiteness by means of the definite article. These facts provide
information about the nature of the word itself. Its function in this particular
sentence is as the subject of the verb ﬁaqad-a ‘held,’ so this provides information
about its syntactic role. Putting these pieces of information together, it is then
possible to know that the case marker in this particular situation is Damma,
which is the nominative marker for definite triptotes.
The second noun, ijtimaaﬁ, also belongs to the triptote declension or declension
one, and is marked for indefiniteness by nunation affixed at the end of the word.
The noun functions in this sentence as direct object of the verb ﬁaqad-a ‘held,’ so
this provides information about its syntactic role. Putting these pieces of infor-
mation together, it is then possible to know that the case marker in this particu-
lar situation is fatHataani, accusative.
The third noun is al-muwaZZaf-iina. It is plural and definite, and it follows the
semi-preposition maﬁ-a. It is therefore in the genitive case. It has a sound mascu-
line plural suffix, which places it in a declension that shows the case inflection by
means of the long vowel before the nuun of the plural suffix (the -ii of -iina). 
Therefore, case as a system is both morphological (word-related) and syntactic
(sentence-related) and is a hybrid “morphosyntactic” category. Each of the three
Arabic cases is presented here with its typical functions. These lists are by no means
exhaustive, but they cover the majority of occurrences of these cases in MSA.

5.3.1 Nominative case (al-rafﬁ™aôdG, al-marfuuﬁ´ƒaôŸG)
The nominative inflection (typically -u or -un, -uuna in the sound masculine plural
suffix, or -aani in the dual suffix) has five key functions.55 It marks the subject of
a verbal sentence, the subject and predicate of equational sentences, certain loca-
tive adverbs, the vocative, and citation forms.
5.3.1.1 THE SUBJECT (al-faaﬁil πYÉØdG) OF A VERBAL SENTENCE ( jumla ﬁﬁliyya á∏ªL
á«∏©a): The subject of the verb is nominative because it forms, along with the verb,
a structural unit, termed jumla á∏ªL. This unit can stand independently of any
other units and conveys a predication.

Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
169
55 In addition, the nominative case marking for defective nouns and adjectives fuses with the geni-
tive (/-in/ for indefinite, /-ii/ for definite); for indeclinable nouns and adjectives it is realized as /-an/
or /-aa/, and for invariable nouns and adjectives, the nominative appears the same as all other
cases; /-aa/. See the paradigms for declensions six, seven, and eight, 5.4.3–5.4.5.
56 The subject of an Arabic sentence with a passive verb, such as this one, is referred to as the naa√ib
al-faaﬁil ‘the deputy subject.’ See Chapter 38 for the use of the passive.
57 The term for “subject” of an Arabic sentence differs depending on whether or not the sentence
contains a verb. The subject of a verbal sentence (al-faaﬁil) is seen as the agent or doer of the action;
the subject of an equational sentence (al-mubtada√) is the topic of a verbless predication. For more
on equational sentence structure, see Chapter 4 , section 2.1ff.

5.3.1.3 CERTAIN ADVERBS: A few adverbs retain a Damma (non-nunated) in many
syntactic functions, even when they are preceded by a preposition. It has been
hypothesized that this adverbial marker is a fossilized remnant of a locative case
in previous stages of language development.58 Certain function words, like mundh-
u and Hayth-u have Damma consistently. Other words, such as qabl-u and baﬁd-u have
the Damma ending when they are used as independent adverbs, but not when used
as prepositions followed by a noun or a pronoun (where they normally have fatHa).

5.3.1.4 THE VOCATIVE (al-nidaa√AGóædG), where someone or some entity is addressed
directly by the speaker. The nominative (without nunation) is used on the vocative
noun unless that noun is the first term of an √iDaafa construction, in which case
it shifts to accusative.59

more on this see Chapter 11, section 4.1.3.
59 See section 5.3.3.12 subsection (3) of this chapter for examples of the first terms of √iDaafa in the
accusative after the vocative particle.
60 If the vocative particle yaa (‘O’) is used, the following word has Damma, but not nunation or the
definite article. If the vocative particle is √ayyu-haa (m.) or √ayyatu-haa (f.), the following word or
words have the definite article. 

Certain exclamations fall into this category:61
O goodness! (‘O peace!’)
yaa salaam-u!

5.3.1.5 THE CITATION FORM of nouns and adjectives in lists or lexicons, although
they may also be cited without desinence, in “bare” form. This function of the
nominative — as the default case marker for substantives in isolation, is in line with
usage in other languages.62 For example, a list of vocabulary words out of context:
monarch
ﬁaahil-un

5.3.2 Genitive case (al-jarr qô÷G, al-majruur QhôÛG; al-xafD ¢†ØÿG):
The genitive inflection (-i or -in, -a [in diptote declensions], -iina [for the sound mas-
culine plural] or -ayni [in the dual]) has three chief functions. It marks:
5.3.2.1 THE OBJECT OF A PREPOSITION: Prepositions are followed by nouns or
noun phrases in the genitive case.

61 Note that exclamations with yaa may also use the preposition li- ‘for’ + a definite noun in the
genitive case:

yaa li-l-maskiin-i!

yaa li-l-√asaf-i!
! p∞°SCÓd Éj
62 Blake notes (1994, 31) that in Greek (and other languages as well) the nominative “is the case used
outside constructions, the case used in isolation, the case used in naming.” He further states the
proposition that (1994, 32) “the nominative simply delineates an entity not a relation between an
entity and a predicate.” See, for example, the Arabic vocabulary lists in Abboud and McCarus 1983.

5.3.2.2 THE OBJECT OF A LOCATIVE ADVERB (Zarf makaan wa-Zarf zamaan ¿Éµe ±ôX
¿ÉeR ±ôXh): Arabic locative adverbs function very much like prepositions. They
are different from true prepositions in that they are derived from triliteral lexical
roots and can also themselves be objects of prepositions. See section 5.3.3.2
following, and Chapter 16, section 3 on “semi-prepositions.”

5.3.3 Accusative case (al-naSb Ö°üædG; al-manSuub Üƒ°üæŸG)
The accusative inflection (-a, -an, -in, -i, -iina [in the sound masculine plural] or -ayni
[in the dual]) has the most functions in Arabic because it not only marks nouns,
adjectives, and noun phrases in a wide range of constructions, but it also marks
adverbial expressions.63 In MSA, it frequently occurs in the following construc-
tions:
5.3.3.1 THE OBJECT OF A TRANSITIVE VERB (al-mafﬁuul bi-hi ¬H∫ƒ©ØŸG): A transitive
verb is one which, in addition to having a subject or agent which accomplishes
the action, also has an object or entity that is affected by the action. The object of
the verb in Arabic is in the accusative case.64

63 See Wright 1967, 2:45–129 for further discussion of the accusative in Classical Arabic.
64 Blake, in his discussion of case roles in general, states (1994, 134): “The accusative is the case that
encodes the direct object of a verb.”

5.3.3.2 LOCATIVE ADVERBS OF BOTH TIME AND PLACE (Zuruuf makaan wa-Zuruuf
zamaan ¿ÉeR ±hôXh ¿Éµe ±hôX): These adverbs are usually in the accusative but
may be made genitive if they follow a preposition.65 They function in ways similar
to prepositions, describing location or direction, and are followed by a noun in
the genitive case. For that reason they are referred to in this work as semi-
prepositions.66 For a more extensive description and examples of prepositions and
semi-prepositions see Chapter 16 section 3.

5.3.3.3 ADVERBIAL EXPRESSIONS OF TIME, PLACE, AND MANNER (al-mafﬁuul ﬁi-hi
¬«a ∫ƒ©ØŸG): The accusative case functions extensively in MSA to indicate the
circumstances under which an action takes place.67 In this function, the
accusative can be used on nouns or adjectives. If the noun or adjective is by itself,
it is normally in the indefinite accusative; if it is the first term of an √iDaafa, it
does not have nunation.

65 They seem to fall into the category of “relator nouns” described by Blake: “Relator nouns are a spe-
cialised subclass of nouns that behave like adpositions (prepositions)” (1994, 205).
66 Wright states: “Many words, which are obviously substantives in the accusative of place . . . may be
conveniently regarded in a certain sense as prepositions” (1967, II:178).
67 Blake (1994, 182) notes that in a number of languages, “it is common for nouns in oblique cases to
be reinterpreted as adverbs, particularly adverbs of place, time and manner.”

5.3.3.4 THE INTERNAL OBJECT OR COGNATE ACCUSATIVE STRUCTURE (al-mafﬁuul
al-muTlaq ≥∏£ŸG∫ƒ©ØŸG). In this structure, the action denoted is intensified
through use of a verbal noun cognate with the verb (i.e., derived from the same
root; usually from the same derivational form (I–X)). Often the verbal noun is
modified by an adjective, also in the accusative:
.kÉqjQòL vÓM n´ƒ°VƒŸG âq∏M

5.3.3.5 THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL ACCUSATIVE (al-Haal ∫É◊G). Expressing a condition
or circumstance that occurs concurrent with or ongoing at the time of the action
of the main verb, a participle is often used to describe that condition 
(al-Haal). The participle agrees with the noun it modifies in number and gender,
but is in the accusative case and usually indefinite. The active participle is widely
used in this function, but occasionally the passive participle or a verbal noun is
used. For more on this topic see Chapter 11, section 2.3.1.

superlative expressions as well as counted nouns between 11 and 99, which are
accusative and singular.

5.3.3.8 THE nawaasix ï°SGƒædG: CONVERTERS TO ACCUSATIVE.
69 Arabic grammar
has a special category for words (verbs and particles) that shift one or more
elements of a clause into the accusative case. There are three groups of these,
each of which is composed of a typical word and what are termed its “sisters”:
kaan-a and its sisters, √inna and its sisters, and Zann-a and its sisters.70
(1)
kaan-a and its “sisters” (kaan-a wa-√axawaat-u-haa É¡JGƒNCGh ¿Éc)71 This set
of verbs has the effect of shifting the predicate (xabar) of an equational
sentence from the nominative case to the accusative case. According to
Hasan (1987, I:545) there are thirteen of these verbs, the most common in
MSA are:
lays-a
to not be72
n¢ù«d
Saar-a
to become
nQÉ°U
baat-a
to become
näÉH
√aSbaH-a
to become
níÑ°UCG
Zall-a
to remain
sπX
176
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
68 See Chapter 15 for further discussion of numerals and counting.
69 “The al-nawaasikh group of words in Arabic is defined by the Arab grammarians according to for-
mal criteria; specifically, the role played by these words in inflection. Thus, words classified as
belonging to the al-nawaasikh category have the effect of inducing one or two elements of the
nuclear sentence to ‘fall’ from the nominative to the accusative case” (Anghelescu 1999, 131).
70 Hasan 1987, 1:543ff. and 630ff. has thorough descriptions of the nawaasix category in Arabic.
71 See also Chapter 36 in this book.
72 In addition to the verb lays-a there are certain negative particles that have similar meanings and
effects, including maa and laa. See Hasan 1987 1:593ff. for more on these particles.

baqiy-a

n»≤H
daama and maa daama

nΩGO Ée  ΩGO
maa zaal-a
to continue to be; to still be;
n∫GR Ée
to not cease to be
√amsaa

≈°ùeCG
These verbs all denote existential states of  being (or not being), becoming,
and remaining. They take accusative complements. That is, the predicate of
the underlying equational predication is accusative.

Zann-a and her sisters (Zanna wa-√axawaat-u-haa É¡JGƒNCGh øX): The verb
Zann-a ‘to suppose, believe’ is another one of the nawaasix. It has the effect
of making both the subject and the predicate of an equational clause accu-
sative.74 This category includes verbs of “certainty and doubt” (Anghelescu
1999, 132).  Hasan breaks this category down into two parts: √afﬁaal al-
quluub75 Üƒ∏≤dG ∫É©aCG or √afﬁaal qalbiyya áq«Ñ∏b ∫É©aCG (verbs of perception or
cognition) and √afﬁaal al-taHwiil πjƒëàdG ∫É©aCG (verbs of transformation).76

74 One of these accusatives may take the form of an object pronoun suffix on the verb. 
75 Which Hasan explains as having to do with psychological perceptions: in particular, emotions and
intellect (1987, II:4, note 4).
76 As explained by Hasan, verbs that have to do with transformation of something from one state to
another (Ibid., note 5).
77 See especially Hasan’s chart of Zann-a and her sisters (1987, II:10). Note also the discussion in
Bohas, Guillaume, and Kouloughli 1990, 34–36.
78 Example from Bohas, Guillaume, and Kouloughli 1990, 34.
79 The verb iﬁtabar-a ‘to consider’ is not included in older lists of √afﬁaal al-quluub, but that is likely
due to the fact that its usage is more modern and recent rather than traditional. Its meaning and
its effect on the sentence components show that it is certainly a member of this category. I thank
my colleague Amin Bonnah for this insight.

5.3.3.12 LESS FREQUENT ACCUSATIVES: Further instances of the use of the accusa-
tive case in MSA are noted in most teaching texts and traditional grammars, but
few or none appeared in the corpus of text studied for this book.  Some of the
most important include:
(1)
kam  accusative singular noun: A singular accusative, indefinite  noun is
used after the question word kam ‘how much, how many?’  
?päCGôb kÓ°üa ºc
?p¥óæØdG ‘  káaôZ ºc
kam faSl-an qara√-ti?
kam ghurfat-an fii l-funduq-i?

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
81 The only exception to this is the cardinal numeral “twelve” which occurs in both the nominative
and the genitive/accusative cases. See Chapter 15 on numerals and numerical expressions.

(2)
Exclamation of astonishment: maa √afﬁal-a! !π©aCG Ée (maa l-taﬁajjub
Öqé©àdG Ée): The accusative is used in the ‘adjectival verb’ construction
on the noun following the exclamation of wonder, astonishment or surprise
maa √afﬁal-a! In this expression, the word maa is followed by “an elative in
the accusative of exclamation,” (Cantarino, 1974, II:210), and then a noun
in the accusative case. Note that this form of the elative is identical with
a Form IV verb, and that it is described this way in some texts and called
fiﬁl al-taﬁajjub.82
!nô¶æŸG nπªLCG Ée
maa √ajmal-a l-manZar-a!
How lovely the view is!
The noun may be replaced by a pronoun suffix:
! o¬n∏ªLCG Ée
maa √ajmal-a-hu!
How lovely it is! 83
(3)
Vocative first term of construct: The accusative case is used with the voca-
tive particles yaa or √ayy-u-haa if the addressee is the first term of an √iDaafa
or noun construct, or if the noun has a pronoun suffix:
! p¬q∏dG nóÑY Éj
! …OÓH n¢VQCG Éj
yaa ﬁabd-a llaah-i!
yaa √arD-a bilaad-ii!
O Abdallah! (lit: ‘servant of God’)
O, earth of my country!
! É¡JnòJÉ°SCGh pá©eÉ÷G nÜÓW Éj
yaa Tullaab-a l-jaamiﬁat-i wa-√asaatidhat-a-haa!
O students and professors of the university!
Even without the vocative particle, a noun in construct or with a pronoun
suffix, understood as the addressee, is put into the accusative:
. . . päGƒª°ùdG ‘ …òdG ÉfÉHCG
√ab-aa-naa lladhii fii l-samawaat-i . . .
Our Father who [art] in heaven . . .

on the Form IV verb, section 9.
83 For more examples see Cantarino 1974, II, 210–13.

√illaa, the noun following the exceptive is in the accusative case if the clause
does not contain a negative.

I spoke with all the [female] students except Yasmine.
This is the case in particular with time-telling, where the word √illaa is used to
express how many minutes are lacking until a particular hour, e.g.:
.kÉ©HQ q’EG oá°ùeÉÿG oáYÉ°ùdG
al-saaﬁat-u l-xaamisat-u √illaa rubﬁ-an.
It is 4:45 (‘five [o’clock] less a quarter [of an hour]’).

It is 6:40 (‘seven [o’clock’] less a third [of an hour]’).
5.3.3.13 OTHER ACCUSATIVES: The accusative case is used in other constructions
besides the ones mentioned, but these are infrequent in MSA.  For more extensive
discussion and listings, especially for literary and classical syntax, see Cantarino
1975, II:161–248; Wright 1967, II:44–129 and in Arabic, Hasan 1987, II:3–430.
5.4 Arabic declensions
Following the practice of Wright (1967, I:234 ff.) and Cowan (1964, 29ff.), this book
refers to the various inflectional classes of substantives as “declensions.”  A
declension is a class of substantives (nouns or adjectives) that exhibits similar
inflectional markings for case and definiteness. Arabic nouns and adjectives fall
into eight declensions:84
1
three-way inflection (called “triptote” in many Arabic grammars)
2
dual
182
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
84 Note that Wright refers to declensions of “undefined” or “defined” nouns, referring to triptote
nouns as the first declension (236) and diptote nouns as the second declension (239). He does not
list other inflectional classes as declensions. Cowan (29) states that “there are three declensions in
Arabic” allotting the first declension to triptotes, the second declension to diptotes and the third
to the uninflectable and undeclinable substantives (32).
For ease of reference in this book, I have allotted declensional status not only to singular and
broken plural noun stems, but also to words that incorporate suffixes denoting dual and plural
number, since they inflect for case and definiteness in different ways.

3
sound feminine plural
4
sound masculine plural
5
diptote 
6
defective
7
uninflectable (for case, but they show inflection for definiteness), and 
8
invariable.
5.4.1 Three-way inﬂection: Triptote (muﬁrab Üô©e)
The triptote is the base category or declension one for Arabic nouns and adjec-
tives.85 The term “triptote” refers to words (nouns and adjectives) that take all three
short vowel case endings, each one differentiating a particular case (Damma, kasra
and fatHa). The triptote declension also allows nouns and adjectives to be marked
for indefiniteness with nunation.86 This is considered the base or complete declen-
sion because it shows the full range of  inflectional markers for all three cases.87
5.4.1.1 THE CASE MARKERS:
(1)
Nominative: The nominative suffix in the triptote declension is Damma
by itself o (-u) for definite words or two Dammas/Damma with a tail o o or l
(-u-n) for indefinite words. Examples:
(1.1)
Noun in the nominative case:
the honor/an honor
al-sharaf-u/sharaf-un
l±ô°T / o±ô°ûdG
the secret/a secret
al-sirr-u/sirr-un
lô°S/ oô°ùdG
the ship/a ship
al-safiinat-u/safiinat-un
láæ«Ø°S / oáæ«Ø°ùdG
(1.2)
Adjective in the nominative case:
short (def.)/short (indef.)
al-qaSiir-u/qaSiir-un
lÒ°üb / oÒ°ü≤dG 
new (def.)/new (indef.)
al-jadiid-u/jadiid-un
lójóL / oójó÷G 
(2)
Genitive: The genitive marker in the triptote declension is kasra by itself 
(-i) p``` for definite words or two kasras (-i-n) m``` for indefinite words. Note that
when kasra is written together with shadda, it may be written either below
the consonant or below the shadda.
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
183
85 The term muﬁrab means ‘fully inflectable.’
86 For more on nunation, see section 4.2 in this chapter.
87 Certain linguists have designated these cases differently in English. Beeston (1970, 51), for exam-
ple, refers to the cases as “independent status (nominative),” “dependent status (genitive),” and
“subordinate status (accusative).” See his Chapter 7 (“Syntactic markers of nouns”) for a brief but
comprehensive description of Arabic case marking.

(2.1)
Noun in the genitive case:
the honor/an honor
al-sharaf-i/sharaf-in
m±ô°Tp/p±ô°ûdG
the secret/a secret
al-sirr-i/sirr-in
xô°S / uô°ùdG
the ship/a ship
al-safiinat-i/safiinat-in
máæ«Ø°S / páæ«Ø°ùdG
(2.2)
Adjective in the genitive case:
short (def.)/short (indef.)
al-qaSiir-i/qaSiir-in
mÒ°üb p/ pÒ°ü≤dG
new (def.)/new (indef.)
al-jadiid-i/jadiid-in
mójóL / pójó÷G
(3)
Accusative: The accusative marker in the triptote declension is fatHa by
itself (-a n  ) for definite words or two fatHas to signal nunation ( -a-nk  ) for
indefinite words.  With the accusative form of nunation, a supporting √alif
is used, except with words ending in taa√marbuuTa or in a hamza preceded
by √alif. This support √alif is visible in writing, but it is not pronounced; it
is only a seat for the two fatHas.

5.4.1.3 THE FIVE NOUNS (al-√asmaa√al-xamsa á°ùªÿG AÉª°SC’G): Within the triptote
declension there is a subset of Arabic nouns from biliteral or even monoliteral
roots which show triptote case inflection in two ways: as a short vowel and as a
long vowel.  The long vowel is used when the word is used as the first term of a
genitive construct (√iDaafa) or when it has a pronoun suffix.
The five nouns are:

5.4.2 Two-way inﬂection: declensions two, three, four, and ﬁve
Certain Arabic noun declensions exhibit only two different case markers, or two-
way inflection.  These declensions have a specific nominative inflectional marker
but they merge the genitive and accusative into just one other inflectional
marker.88 Technically, these nouns are considered to exhibit all three cases; it is
just that the genitive and accusative have exactly the same form.89
The declensions that have two-way inflection fall into two major categories, the
suffix declensions and the diptote declension. The suffix declensions are deter-
mined by number suffixes and  include the dual, the sound masculine plural, and
the sound feminine plural, whereas the diptote declension includes words that
fall into particular semantic and morphological categories, as described below.
5.4.2.1 SUFFIX DECLENSIONS: THE DUAL (DECLENSION TWO), THE SOUND MASCULINE
PLURAL (DECLENSION THREE) AND THE SOUND FEMININE PLURAL (DECLENSION
FOUR). Three sets of two-way inflections are based on dual and plural suffixes
rather than word stems.  That is, once the suffix is attached to a word, it is the
suffix itself that determines how the word will be marked for case.  These
number-marking suffixes in Arabic are all restricted to two case markings rather
88 Sometimes, in this latter category, the combined genitive/accusative inflection is referred to as the
“oblique” or essentially, non-nominative case marker.
89 Traditional Arabic grammatical theory evolved the concept that all nouns are marked for every
case, but that in some of them the case marker is “virtual” or “implied” (muqaddar) rather than
overt (Zaahir).

than three. These suffixes carry two kinds of information: number (dual or plural)
and case (nominative or genitive/accusative).
(1)
Declension two: The dual (al-muthannaa ≈æãŸG) As described in section 3.1
Arabic uses a suffix on the singular stem to mark the noun as being two in
number, or in the dual. The dual suffix has two case forms, and is not
inflected for definiteness.

Nuun-deletion with possessive pronouns and as first term of construct:
When a dual noun is the first term of a construct, or if it has a pronoun
suffix, the nuun of the dual suffix (and its short vowel kasra) is deleted.90

when the case changes. The final short vowel ( fatHa /-a/) remains the same
in both the nominative and the genitive/accusative. This fatHa is not a case
ending, but rather part of the spelling of the suffix. In pause form it is not
pronounced.

(and its short vowel fatha) of the suffix is deleted (similar to what occurs
with the dual suffix above 5.4.2.1(1.5).91 The long case-marking vowels /-uu-/
or /-ii-/ are then left as the remaining part of the suffix.

Declension four: The sound feminine plural ( jamﬁmu√annath saalim
⁄É°S åfDƒe ™ªL). The sound feminine plural is also restricted to two
case markers. Unlike the dual and sound masculine plural, where the
case marking shows up on the long vowel of the suffix, the case marking
for the sound feminine plural occurs at the end of the suffix, just as nor-
mal triptote short vowel case marking would occur.  However, the sound
feminine plural is restricted to only two of the short vowels: Damma and
kasra. It cannot take  fatHa. The genitive/accusative form takes kasra or
kasrataan.

5.4.2.2 DECLENSION FIVE: DIPTOTE (al-mamnuuﬁmin-a l-Sarf ±ô°üdG øe ´ƒæªŸG): The
term “diptote” refers to an inflectional category or declension of Arabic nouns
and adjectives that are formally restricted when they are indefinite:
•
They do not take nunation.
•
They do not take kasra (the genitive marker).
Diptotes therefore, when indefinite, only exhibit two case-markers: final -u
(Damma) for nominative case and final -a ( fatHa) for both genitive and accusative.
They look identical in the indefinite genitive and accusative cases.

Sound feminine plural adjective: This form of the adjective is used only to
refer to groups of female human beings:
92 Note that the adjective agreeing with majaalaat-in shows the accusative as fatHataan because it is
triptote and belongs to declension one. Both majaalaat and waasiﬁa are in the accusative, but they
are marked differently because they fall into two different declensions.

Proper names of non-Arabic origin: This includes a large number of
place names or names of geographical features in the Middle East
whose origins are from other Semitic languages or other (non-Semitic)
Middle Eastern languages.  A salient characteristic of most of these
names is that they do not have the definite article.

95 In MSA, names of places in other parts of the world, such as nyuu yuurk ∑Qƒj ƒ«f (New York), waash-
inTun ø£æ°TGh (Washington), or istukhulm º∏¡µà°SG (Stockholm) are usually left uninflected, since
they are not readily accommodated into the Arabic inflectional class system.

A helpful rule of thumb with Middle Eastern place names in Arabic is
that if they carry the definite article, then they inflect as triptotes, e.g.:
Rabat

5.4.3 DECLENSION SIX: DEFECTIVE NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES (√asmaa√naaqiSa AÉª°SCG
á°übÉf; al-ism al-manquuS ¢Uƒ≤æŸG º°S’G). This inflectional class includes primarily
words derived from “defective” roots, that is, lexical roots whose final element is
a semivowel rather than a consonant.
It includes masculine singular active participles from all forms (I–X) of defec-
tive verbs, verbal nouns from forms V and VI, and a set of noun plurals based pri-
marily on the diptote plural pattern CaCaaCiC. The characteristic feature of this
declension is that the final root consonant appears in the form of two kasras in
the nominative and genitive indefinite.  In an ordinary written text, these short
vowels are not visible.96
Thus in this declension, the nominative and genitive inflections are identical;
the accusative shows inflection for fatHa or fatHataan.
Noun inflections: gender, humanness, number, definiteness, and case
197
96 The two kasras may be added into a printed text (in a newspaper article, for example) should there
be ambiguity about the meaning of the word.

5.4.4 Declension seven: indeclinable nouns (al-ism al-maqSuur Qƒ°ü≤ŸG º°S’G)
Indeclinable nouns show no variation in case, only definiteness. They are chiefly
derived from defective lexical roots and include, in particular, passive participles
(m.) from all forms (I–X) and nouns of place from defective verbs.100 They normally
end with √alif maqSuura.

5.4.5 Declension eight: Invariable nouns
This noun class consists of a set of nouns which vary neither in case nor in defi-
niteness. They are spelled with final √alif maqSuura unless the previous letter is
yaa√, in which case, √alif Tawiila is used.103
200
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
102Some passive participles of the derived forms serve also as nouns of place.
103Abboud and McCarus 1983, II:19–20 provide an informative discussion of this declension. ﬁAbd al-
Latif et al. 1997, 54–55, describe these nouns as having a suffixed feminine marker, √alif maqSuura,
and that they are therefore diptote, and do not take nunation.

names and borrowed words ending in /-aa/ are also invariable in their
inflection.

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

1 The construct phrase or √iDaafa áaÉ°VE’G
In Arabic, two nouns may be linked together in a relationship where the second
noun determines the first by identifying, limiting, or defining it, and thus the
two nouns function as one phrase or syntactic unit. Traditionally, in English
descriptions of Arabic grammar, this unit is called the “genitive construct,” the
“construct phrase,” or “annexation structure.” In Arabic it is referred to as the
√iDaafa (‘annexation; addition’). As Beeston explains, “The link between a noun
and an entity which amplifies it is termed by the Arab grammarians √iDaafa
‘annexation’, and the noun amplified is said to be muDaaf ‘annexed’” (1970, 45). 
Similar constructions in English, where two nouns occur together with one
defining the other, might be, for example, “coffee cup,” “university library,” or (as
one word) “eggshell.” In fact, English often juxtaposes nouns to create new hybrid
terms: “airbag,” “seat belt,” or “keyboard.” Another English equivalent to the Ara-
bic construct phrase is a possessive phrase using “of” (“the Queen of Sweden,” “a
bottle of wine”) or the possessive suffix / -’s /on the possessing noun (“Cairo’s cafés”,
“the newspaper’s editorial”).
The noun-noun genitive construct is one of the most basic structures in the Ara-
bic language and occurs with high frequency. The first noun, the muDaaf (‘the
added’), has neither the definite article nor nunation because it is in an
“annexed” state, determined by the second noun.1 But, as the head noun of the
phrase, the first noun can be in any case: nominative, genitive, or accusative,
depending on the function of the √iDaafa unit in a sentence structure. The second,
or annexing noun, is called the muDaaf √ilay-hi.2 It is marked either for definite-
ness or indefiniteness, and is always in the genitive case.

Construct phrases and nouns in apposition
1 “In Arabic it is the amplifying term whose definitional status yields the definitional status of the
whole phrase: consequently, an annexed substantive will not itself have the article” (Beeston 1970,
46).
2 Literally, the noun ‘added to.’ For an extensive discussion (in English) of √iDaafa constructions in
literary Arabic, see Cantarino 1970, II: 92-119. See also Wright 1967, II:198-234 for a summary of the
rules for Classical Arabic “Status constructus and the genitive.” Hasan 1987, III:1-180 has a thor-
ough analysis of the genitive construct (in Arabic).

In terms of semantic relationships between the nouns in an Arabic construct
phrase, they are very wide-ranging.3 Here they are classified in relatively discrete
groups, but clear boundaries cannot always be established between the groups and
sometimes membership blurs or overlaps. Eleven general categories are listed here.4
1.1 Types of √iDaafas
1.1.1 Identity relationship
In this broad category, the second term specifies, defines, limits, or explains the
particular identity of the first:5
Definite:

xÖM oπFÉ°SQ
1.1.2 Possessive relationship
In this kind of annexation structure, the first term can be interpreted as belong-
ing (in the very broadest sense) to the second term. In certain respects, it is very
close to the next category, the partitive relationship, and it is sometimes difficult
to draw a line between the two.

1.1.3 Partitive relationship
Here the annexed term (the first term) serves as a determiner to describe a part or
quantity of the annexing term. This includes the use of nouns that are quantifiers
(“some,” “all,” “most”), certain numbers and fractions, and superlative constructions.
206
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
3 Beeston refers to the “semantic polyvalency of the annexation structure” (1970, 46).
4 Holes 1995, 166-67 (after Beeston 1970, 45-47) identifies six categories of constructs, including the
adjective √iDaafa or “unreal” √iDaafa (√iDaafa ghayr Haqiiqiyya).
5 Also called the epexegetical genitive, or genitive of explanation.
6 Although the second noun, Hasan, has nunation, it is considered definite because it is a proper name.

1.1.4 Agent relationship
In this type of construct, the second term is the agent or doer of the action and
the first term is a verbal noun (maSdar), the name of an action:

1.1.4.1 ACTION, AGENT, OBJECT: In this variant of the agent-relationship √iDaafa,
where the object of the verbal action is mentioned in addition to the doer of the
action, then the object follows the √iDaafa construction, and is in the accusative
case (as object of the underlying transitive verb):

1.1.10 Quotation or title relationship
Here the second term is a title or a quotation. When this is the case, the words of
the title or quotation in quotation marks are considered to be set off from the
case-marking requirements of the second term of the √iDaafa, and are inflected
independently, not necessarily in the genitive.

1.1.11 Clause relationship
A clause in its entirety may occasionally form the second term of an √iDaafa. For
purposes of clarity, the boundary between first term and second term is indicated
by a plus sign (+) in the Arabic transliteration:

1.2 Rules of the noun construct (√iDaafa áaÉ°VEG):
1.2.1 The ﬁrst term of the construct
The first term of a construct phrase has neither the definite article nor nunation
because it is defined through the second term, which determines the definiteness
or indefiniteness of the entire phrase. The first term of a construct phrase cannot
have a possessive pronoun suffix.
The first term carries a case marker which is determined by the syntactic role
of the phrase in the sentence or clause. Examples:
1.2.1.1 FIRST TERM OF CONSTRUCT IS NOMINATIVE:
.lIóq≤©e p§°ShC’G p¥ô°ûdG oá∏µ°ûe
mushkilat-u l-sharq-i l-√awsaT-i muﬁaqqadat-un.
The problem of the Middle East is complex.
1.2.1.2 FIRST TERM OF CONSTRUCT IS ACCUSATIVE:
.p¢SÉ°SC’G pôé◊G p™°Vh ná∏ØM nôn°†M
HaDar-a Haflat-a waDﬁ-il-Hajr-i l-√asaas-i.
He attended the party for the laying of the cornerstone.
1.2.1.3 FIRST TERM OF CONSTRUCT IS GENITIVE:
.m§«°ûf mQhO pÖ©∏`d mOGó©à°SG ≈∏Y »g
hiya ﬁalaa stiﬁdaad-in li-laﬁb-i dawr-in nashiiT-in.
She is ready to play an active role (‘for playing an active role’).
1.2.1.4 THE RESTRICTION ON NUNATION on the first term of the construct applies
not only to the nunation which marks indefiniteness, but also to the final nuuns
of the dual and the sound masculine plural. These nuuns are deleted on the first
term of a construct phrase.

1.3 Modiﬁers of the construct
1.3.1 Modifying the ﬁrst term
A construct phrase cannot be interrupted by modifiers for the first term. Any
adjectives or other modifiers applying to the first term of the √iDaafa must fol-
low the entire √iDaafa. Modifiers for the first term agree with it in gender, num-
ber, case, and definiteness.

tive, but in newspaper Arabic the name of the emirate is often treated as a lexical unit and not
inflected.

1.3.2 Modifying the second term

it and agreeing with it in definiteness, gender, number, and case.

1.3.3 Modiﬁcation of both terms of the construct
When a construct or √iDaafa needs modifiers for both terms, the general order is
to put the modifiers for the last term closest to the √iDaafa, and then modifiers for
the first term(s), in ascending order. Each modifier agrees with its noun in case,
gender, number, and definiteness.

1.4 Demonstrative pronouns in construct phrases
1.4.1 Demonstrative with ﬁrst term of construct
Normally, when a noun is modified by a demonstrative pronoun, that pronoun
precedes the noun and the noun also has the definite article (for example, haa-
dhaa l-qarn-u o¿ô≤dG Gòg ‘this century’).8 However, when a noun as first term of a con-
struct is modified by a demonstrative pronoun, that pronoun follows the entire

8 For further discussion of demonstrative pronouns, see Chapter 13.

√iDaafa structure because of the restriction that prevents the presence of the def-
inite article on the first term of a construct. The pronoun agrees with the first
term in gender and number.

1.4.2 Demonstrative with second term of construct
The second term of a construct or √iDaafa may be preceded directly by a demon-
strative pronoun plus definite article because the second term can be marked for
definiteness:

1.5 Complex or multi-noun construct
A construct phrase may consist of more than two nouns related to each other
through the use of the genitive case. When this happens, the second and all sub-
sequent nouns are in the genitive case and only the last noun in the entire con-
struct phrase is marked for either definiteness or indefiniteness. Thus, the medial
nouns, the ones which are neither first nor last, are all in the genitive, and none
of them have nunation or the definite article. That is, the medial nouns combine
certain features of being the first term of an √iDaafa (no definite article or nuna-
tion) with one feature of being the second term of an √iDaafa (marked for genitive
case).

1.6 Joint annexation
Traditional Arabic style requires that the first term of the √iDaafa or annexation
structure be restricted to one item. It cannot be two or more items joined with wa-
‘and.’ If more than one noun is to be included in the expression then they follow
the √iDaafa and refer back to it by means of a resumptive pronoun suffix.

This rule is widely observed. However, it is also regularly broken, and “joint annex-

These examples and others show that joint annexation is an area of modern
Arabic syntax where the traditional rules are still in use but routinely violated.
This particular area of Arabic grammatical structure is in a state of flux, with the
newer structure being widely used in everyday language. 
1.7 Special cases of constructs
1.7.1 The use of ﬁadam and √iﬁaada 
Two verbal nouns, ﬁadam ‘lack of’ and √iﬁaada ‘repetition, resumption’ are fre-
quently used in lexicalizing functions, as the first term of √iDaafas to create com-
pound lexical items.9
1.7.1.1 ﬁadam + NOUN: The noun ﬁadam is a privative term that expresses
negative concepts or “lack of”: it is used with verbal nouns to create compound
Arabic expressions conveying concepts expressed in English by prefixes such as
“non-,” “in-,” or “dis-,” or to express what would be a negative infinitive.

Many official titles of dignitaries and royalty consist of genitive constructs, for
example:

1.7.3 Use of nafs ‘same’ as ﬁrst term

term in order to express the concept of “the same ________.”11

1.7.4 Coalescence of the construct
Certain frequently used constructs have come to function as solid units and are
even occasionally written together as one word. This fusing of terms is rare in Ara-
bic, but does happen occasionally:
1.7.4.1 FIXED EXPRESSIONS:
capital (financial resources)
ra√s-u maal-in
m∫Ée o¢SCGQ
ra√smaal
∫Éª°SCGQ
administrative officer
qaa√im-u maqaam-in
mΩÉ≤e oºFÉb

qaa√imaqaam
ΩÉ≤ªFÉb
1.7.4.2 THREE TO NINE HUNDRED: Although optionally written as one word, the
first term still inflects for case. For example:
five hundred
xams-u mi√at-in
máÄe o¢ùªN
xams-u-mi√at-in
máÄªo°ùªN
nine hundred
tisﬁ-u mi√at-in
máÄe o™°ùJ
tisﬁ-u-mi√at-in
máÄªo©°ùJ
1.8 Avoiding the construct phrase or √iDaafa
Sometimes an √iDaafa is avoided by means of linking two nouns with a preposi-
tion, usually min or li-. This happens especially if the first noun is modified by an
adjective or a phrase that would otherwise have to be placed after the √iDaafa con-
struction. It is a stylistic option.

1.9 Adjectives in construct phrases
Adjectives or participles functioning as adjectives may occur in construct phrases
either as the first or second term, in the following types of constructions.
1.9.1 Modiﬁer as ﬁrst term of construct
Sometimes an adjective or a participle with adjectival meaning will appear as the
first term of a construct phrase instead of following the noun as a modifier. In
these phrases the adjective remains in the masculine gender, but it may be sin-
gular or plural. These expressions are often set phrases and tend to be used with
particular adjectives, as follows.

1.9.2 The adjective or “false” √iDaafa (√iDaafa ghayr Haqiiqiyya á«≤«≤M ÒZ áaÉ°VEG)
The “false” or “unreal” √iDaafa, also called the “adjective” √iDaafa, is a special case
of the construct phrase where an adjective serves as the first term and acts as a
modifier of a noun. Not only can an adjective serve as the first item in this struc-
ture, but, contrary to the general rules for the √iDaafa structure, this adjective
may take the definite article if the phrase modifies a definite noun. Since this
type of construct violates the rule against the first term of a construct phrase tak-
ing a definite article, it is termed “unreal” or “false.” 
This construction is a way of expressing a quality of a particular component of
an item, often equivalent to hyphenated expressions in English such as: long-term,
Construct phrases and nouns in apposition
221

hard-nosed, or cold-blooded. It is generally used to express qualities of “inalienable
possession,” that is, qualities that are “naturally attributable” to their owners.12
The adjective √iDaafa is quite frequent in MSA because it is a construction that
can be used to express recently coined, complex modifying terms such as “multi-
lateral,” or “long-range.”
In this construction, the adjective agrees with the noun it modifies in case,
number, and gender. The second term of the adjective √iDaafa is a definite noun in
the genitive case and refers to a particular property of the modified noun.
1.9.2.1 ADJECTIVE √iDaafa AS NOUN MODIFIER:
(1)
Modifying a definite noun: When modifying a definite noun, the first term
of the adjective √iDaafa agrees with the noun in gender, number, and case,
and it also has the definite article:

(2)
Modifying an indefinite noun: When modifying an indefinite noun, the
first term of the adjective √iDaafa does not have the definite article. How-
ever, neither does it have nunation, because this is prevented by its being
the first term of an √iDaafa. It agrees with the noun it modifies in gender,
number, and case:
.øjôëÑdG Qhõj iƒà°ùŸG ™«aQ q»µjôeCG ∫hDƒ°ùe ∫hCG ƒg

12 Killean 1970, 11. Killean’s article “The false construct in Modern Literary Arabic” is one of the few
that deal with the syntactic and semantic analysis of this structure from the point of view of gen-
erative syntax.
13 Although the English equivalent of this sentence uses the definite article to refer to the “American
official,” the Arabic structure using the term √awwal ‘first’ is followed by an indefinite noun.

1.9.2.2 ADJECTIVE √iDaafa AS PREDICATE OF EQUATIONAL SENTENCE: When serving
as the predicate of an equational sentence, the first term of the adjective
√iDaafa does not have the definite article, in keeping with the rules for predicate
adjectives. It agrees with the noun it refers to in gender, number, and case.

1.9.3 The descriptive construct with ghayr plus adjective
In this unique construction, an adjective serves as the second term of a construct
phrase. The noun ghayr ‘ non-; un-, in-, other than’ is used as the first term of the
construct in order to express negative or privative concepts denoting absence of a
quality or attribute. As the first term of a construct, ghayr carries the same case
as the noun it modifies. As a noun which is the first term of an √iDaafa, it can-
not have the definite article. The second term of the √iDaafa construction is an
adjective or participle in the genitive case which agrees with the noun being mod-
ified in gender, number, and definiteness. Here are some examples:

2 Nouns in apposition (badal ∫óH )
Nouns or noun phrases are said to be in apposition with one another when they are
juxtaposed and both refer to the same entity, but in different ways.14 Phrases such
as “my cat, Blondie,” “Queen Victoria,” “President Bush,” or “King Hussein” con-
sist of nouns in apposition. As a general rule, the nouns agree in case, number,
gender, and definiteness, but one subset of appositional specifiers requires the
accusative case.
2.1 Straight apposition
In straight apposition, the noun in apposition takes the same case as the noun
with which it is in apposition.
2.1.1 Names and titles
The title (normally with the definite article) is followed directly by the name of
the person:

2.1.2 Reduced relative clauses
In this form of apposition, the specifying noun is equivalent to a relative noun
phrase:
224
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
14 The term badal (literally, ‘substitution; exchange’) is used in traditional Arabic grammar to
describe more than the noun-noun appositional relationship. It also covers the use of the demon-
strative pronoun in demonstrative phrases, and modifying adjectives. In this section of the refer-
ence grammar, however, the discussion of badal is restricted to appositional structures that
include nouns and personal pronouns. For a detailed discussion of apposition see Wright 1967, II:
272ff. Cachia (1973) gives the terms tabﬁor tabﬁiyya for ‘apposition,’ and Hasan (1987) refers to
nouns in apposition as tawaabiﬁ(literally: ‘followers’).

In more general terms, the noun or nouns in apposition further specify the head
noun:

2.2 Accusative Apposition
A noun in apposition to a pronoun is put into the accusative case because it spec-
ifies that noun in a particular way and is considered a form of tamyiiz or accusa-
tive of specification.
When an independent pronoun (often the first person plural) is further speci-
fied, the specifying noun is in the accusative case as the object of an understood
verb such as √aﬁnii ‘I mean,’ or √axuSS-u ‘I specify.’

2.3 Appositive speciﬁcation of quantity or identity
Arabic nouns may be further specified by other nouns in terms of quantity or
identity. In most of these cases, the specifying noun agrees in case with the head
noun and carries a personal pronoun suffix referring back to the head noun. The
pronoun agrees with the head noun in number and gender. Quantity nouns such
as kull, jamiiﬁ, baﬁD, and fractions, as well as identity nouns such as nafs ‘same; self’
are used in these expressions.15

Construct phrases and nouns in apposition
227

Certain Arabic nouns act primarily as specifiers or determiners for other nouns.
They may be used as first terms of construct phrases, in apposition with nouns,
with pronouns, or independently. Many of these nouns express quantities; some
express other kinds of specification.
Here are five major classes of specifiers and quantifiers in MSA.
1 Expressions of totality
1.1 kull qπc ‘all; every; the whole’
1.1.1 “Each, every”
When used as the first term of a construct phrase with a singular, indefinite
noun, kull has the meaning of ‘each’ or ‘every.’1
everything
kull-u shay√-in A»°T  πc
every one
kull-u waaHid-in óMGh  πc

kull-u riyaal-in min daxl-i-naa
li-kull-i fannaan-in ﬁarabiyy-in

every riyal of our income
for every Arab artist
1.1.2 “all, the whole”
When used with a definite singular noun or a pronoun, kull has the meaning of
‘all of,’ ‘the whole,’ or ‘all.’
áæµªŸG IóYÉ°ùŸG πc
Gòg πc
kull-u l-musaaﬁadat-i l-mumkinat-i

1.1.4 kull-un min øe wπc ‘each; both; every one of’
The noun kull may be used as an indefinite noun with nunation, followed by the
preposition min ‘of’ to convey the meaning of totality. When there are only two
items, the phrase kull min functions as the equivalent of ‘both.’

1.1.5 kull-un wπc; al-kull qπµdG ‘everyone’ 
The noun kull may be used alone to express the idea of ‘everyone.’ It may occur
with or without the definite article. Agreement is masculine singular.

1.3 kilaa~kilay/ kiltaa~kiltay - »∏c-Óc ~»à∏c - Éà∏c ‘both; both of (m. & f.)’
The specialized dual quantifiers kilaa/kilay (m.) and kiltaa/kiltay (f.) are used to
express the idea of ‘both.’ They are followed by a definite dual noun in the geni-
tive or by a dual pronoun suffix. These two words inflect as does the dual suffix
when it is the first term of a construct, but they do not inflect for case when fol-
lowed by a noun; only when followed by a pronoun.

2 Expressions of limited number, non-speciﬁc number, or partiality
There are several ways to express partial inclusion in Arabic.

Noun specifiers and quantifiers
231
2.1 baﬁD ¢†©H ‘some,’ ‘some of ’
The masculine singular noun baﬁD is followed by a singular or plural noun in the
genitive or by a pronoun suffix. It may also be used independently. 
2.1.1 As ﬁrst term of a construct
The quantifier baﬁD is usually followed by a definite noun in the genitive case.
Note that adjectives that follow the construct normally agree in gender and num-
ber with the second term, the noun being quantified.

2.1.3 Reciprocal ¢†©H: Double use of baﬁD
The concept of “each other” or “together” may be expressed with the use of baﬁD
as a reciprocal pronoun. The first baﬁD has a pronoun suffix; the second has either
the definite article or nunation.

3 Expressions of “more,” “most,” and “majority”
Arabic uses several expressions to convey concepts of “more,” “most of,” or “the
majority of.”
3.1 “More”
When discussing the concept of “more,” there are two sides to it: a quality can be
greater in intensity, which is expressed by the comparative (or “elative”) form of
the adjective (e.g., more important, more famous); this is discussed in Chapter 10,
sections 4.2.1–4.2.3.
However, there is also another use of “more” to mean “more of something,” “a
greater quantity/amount of something” where the “more” expression is followed by
a noun or noun phrase. In contemporary Arabic the phrase al-maziid min øe ójõŸG
(literally ‘the increase of’) is often used to express this concept of “more of.”

3.2 ‘Most of’: muﬁZam º¶©e and √akthar ÌcCG
3.2.1 muﬁZam
The expression ‘most of’ is often accomplished with the word muﬁZam as the first
term of an √iDaafa:

3.2.2 √akthar ÌcCG ‘more; most’
The elative adjective √akthar ‘more; most’ may also be used to express ‘most’ as
first term of an √iDaafa. The following noun is definite, may be singular or plural,
and is in the genitive case.

âbƒdG ÌcCG

√akthar-u l-waqt-i 
√akthar-u l-muwaaTin-iina
√akthar-u l-naas-i

most of the citizens
most people
3.3 Expression of “majority”
The Arabic superlative adjective √aghlab, the derived noun √aghlabiyya, or the
active participle ghaalib are all used to express the concept of “majority.”
.ÉNQDƒe ¢ù«d  º¡Ñ∏ZCG
√aghlab-u-hum lays-a mu√arrix-an.
The majority of them are not historians.
4 Scope of quantiﬁer agreement
The scope of agreement or concord refers to agreement patterns that apply to
“quantified construct states.”2 Agreement or concord is normally shown through
adjectives and/or verbs. 
Patterns of agreement with quantified construct states can vary in MSA and the
phenomenon has been studied by both Parkinson and LeTourneau. As LeTourneau
remarks (1995, 30), “a verb may agree in number and gender with either the quan-
tifier (invariantly masculine singular) or with its complement.” 
Parkinson’s findings (as paraphrased by LeTourneau 1995, 31) reveal that “cer-
tain grammatical features on the second term in the QCS [quantified construct
state] license only one agreement option. Thus, if the second term to kull is either
an indefinite feminine singular or a definite plural, the verb must agree with the
second term (logical agreement, in traditional terms); if baﬁD has a pronominal
suffix and the verb follows, agreement with the quantifier (grammatical agree-
ment) is mandatory (Parkinson 1975, 66).”
4.1 Agreement with quantiﬁer
In conformity with the above-stated rule, the agreement is with the quantifier
when it has a pronoun suffix (such as baﬁD or √aghlab). 
.ÉNQDƒe ¢ù«d º¡Ñ∏ZCG
√aghlab-u-hum lays-a mu√arrix-an.
The majority of them are not historians (‘is not a historian’).
4.2 Agreement with speciﬁed noun
The agreement may be with the noun that is the second term of the √iDaafa. This
occurs especially with adjectives that immediately follow the noun.
Noun specifiers and quantifiers

2 LeTourneau, 1995, 30.  In this article, “Internal and external agreement in quantified construct
states,” LeTourneau  provides detailed analysis on this topic. See also Parkinson 1975 on the agree-
ment of baﬁD and kull.

5.2 Expression of ‘any; whichever’ √ayy/ √ayya áqjCG / …CG + noun
The noun √ayy is used as the first term of an √iDaafa to express the concept of “any”
or “whichever.” If the noun following √ayy …CG is feminine, √ayy may shift to √ayya
áqjCG , but this does not always happen. The noun following √ayy is indefinite and in
the genitive case. It is normally singular, but is sometimes plural.

one.’ When used with a dual noun, it indicates ‘either one of’; it is normally indef-
inite and takes nunation.

This chapter is in two parts. The first part deals with function: adjectives in con-
text and issues such as agreement, word order, and inflection, including inflec-
tion for comparative and superlative. The second part focuses on the derivational
morphology or word structure of adjectives.
Part one: Function
1 Attributive adjectives
An attributive adjective is part of a noun phrase and follows the noun directly,
agreeing with it in gender, number, case, and definiteness:

1.1 Attributive adjective modifying noun + pronoun sufﬁx
A noun with a pronoun suffix is considered definite; therefore, an adjective that
modifies that noun carries the definite article, in addition to agreeing in gender,
case, and number with the noun:
áq«©«Ñ£dG É¡JÉÄ«H ‘

2 Predicate adjectives
A predicate adjective is used in an equational (verbless) sentence to provide
information about the subject of the sentence, thus completing the clause. In
an Arabic equational sentence, there is usually no overt copula, or present
tense form of the verb “to be,” linking the subject and predicate. When acting
as a predicate, the adjective agrees with the noun or pronoun subject in gender
and number. It is usually in the nominative case. However, it does not normally
take the definite article because it is predicating a quality or attribute to the
subject.

3 Adjectives as substantives
Adjectives may serve as substantives or noun substitutes, just as they sometimes
do in English:
.ójó÷G ™e §∏àîj Ëó≤dG å«M

4 Arabic adjective inﬂection
Adjectives in Arabic inflect for four morphological categories: gender, number,
case, and definiteness. Many of them also inflect for a fifth category: degree (com-
parative and superlative). 
As far as the first four categories are concerned, adjectives mirror the inflec-
tional categories of the nouns that they modify, that is, they agree or are in con-
cord with those nouns. In most cases the agreement or concord is direct or
“strict,” meaning that the adjective reflects exactly the categories of the noun.1
As noted above, Arabic adjectives normally follow the nouns they modify.
4.1 Inﬂectional categories: gender, number, case, deﬁniteness
Much like nouns, Arabic adjectives have a base form, which is the singular mas-
culine, and an inflected (marked) form for the feminine, usually marked by taa√
marbuuTa. They also inflect for dual, and for plural. In the plural, they take broken
or sound plural forms, or both. 
In terms of case inflection, adjectives fall into the same declensions as nouns,
depending on their morphological form (their lexical root and pattern structure).
4.1.1 Masculine singular adjectives

1 Adjectives in general are refered to in morphological theory as “targets” rather than “controlers.”
That is, they are targets of the agreement requirements of nouns.  As Carstairs-McCarthy (1994,
769) states: “Adjectives are gender targets, i.e., they must agree with nouns in gender as well as
number and case.”

4.1.4 Feminine singular adjectives
The feminine singular adjective is used to modify feminine singular nouns and
also for nonhuman plural nouns. The use of the feminine singular to modify
nonhuman plural nouns is referred to as “deflected” agreement rather than
“strict” agreement.
242

2 Note that when numerals are used for counting over ten, the counted noun is grammatically sin-
gular and any agreeing adjective is also singular, although the meaning is plural. For example:

They remain in the masculine singular base form.4

4.2 Adjective inﬂection for comparative and superlative (ism al-tafDiil π«°†ØàdG º°SG)
The comparative and superlative forms of adjectives in Arabic are sometimes
referred to together in grammatical descriptions of Arabic as “elative” forms
244
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
4 For an interesting discussion of discrepancies in gender agreement in the Qur’ân, see Gaballa
1999.
5 Wehr (1979, 1050) describes the adjective maHD as “invariable for gender and number,” but I found
it at least once in the feminine, in Hasan (1987, III:1) in his description of the types of √iDaafa as
maHDat-un wa-ghayr-u maHDat-in ‘pure and non-pure.’

because they signify a more intense degree of the quality described by the adjec-
tive.6 The Arabic term ism al-tafDiil signifies that these are terms of preference, pre-
eminence, or preferment. In this text, the more standard terms “comparative”
and “superlative” are used to refer to these forms of adjectives. 
Just as English has sequences such as large, larger, largest, or nice, nicer, nicest, to
indicate increasing degrees of intensity, Arabic has equivalent sequences consist-
ing of base form, comparative, and superlative forms.
4.2.1 Comparative adjective: √afﬁal π©aCG
Arabic adjectives derived from Form I triliteral roots inflect form the compara-
tive through a pattern shift. No matter what the original or base pattern of the
adjective, the comparative pattern shifts to √aCCaC (√afﬁal π©aCG), and it is dip-
tote. That is, it does not take nunation or kasra in its indefinite form.7 Note also
that the initial hamza of this pattern is hamzat al-qaTﬁ, that is, it does not elide.
It is stable.

4.2.1.4 GEMINATE ROOTS: Comparative adjectives from geminate roots (where
the second and third root consonants are the same) have a variant comparative
form due to a rule which prevents a short vowel from occurring between two
identical consonants. Thus instead of √afﬁal, the form is √afall qπaCG, and the two
identical consonants are together, spelled with a shadda:

4.2.2 Inﬂection and use of comparative
Note that the Arabic comparative adjective does not show difference in gender. In
fact, comparative adjectives do not inflect for gender or number or definiteness.
They inflect only for case. When comparing two things and contrasting them, the
preposition min is used the way ‘than’ is used in English.

reference to what it is compared to, so there is no need for the preposition min:

It will lead to a firmer relationship between the two of them.
4.2.2.4 COMPARATIVE IN FORM ONLY: An adjective may occasionally have the
comparative form, although its meaning is not comparative. In this case, it
inflects for number, gender, and definiteness, as well as case:

A special form of adjective is the word for ‘other.’ It has a unique inflec-

does not have comparative or superlative meaning. It inflects for number,
gender, case, and definiteness.

4.2.3 The periphrastic or phrasal comparative
Certain qualities, attributes, or descriptors do not fit into the pattern-change par-
adigm for comparative and superlative meanings. For example, nisba adjectives
and the active and passive participles functioning as adjectives from the derived
verb forms (II–X) have extra consonants or vowels as part of their essential word
structure, so they cannot shift into the √afﬁal pattern without losing some of their
identity and meaning. Moreover, certain colors are already of the √afﬁal pattern,
so how does one express a quality such as “blacker,” or “whiter”?
Arabic handles this using a strategy similar to using “more” in English. Inten-
sity words such as “more” plus the adjective are used, or words such as “stronger”
plus a color word in order to form a descriptive comparative phrase.
The most common intensifying words used for forming the periphrastic com-
parative are:
ÌcCG
qó°TCG
qπbCG
√akthar
√ashadd
√aqall
more
stronger
less
This intensifying word is then joined with a noun in the indefinite accusative
case, a structure called tamyiiz or ‘accusative of specification.’8

4.2.4 The superlative
The form of the Arabic superlative adjective, which indicates the highest degree
of comparison, resembles the comparative form √afﬁal π©aCG. There are differences,
however. The superlative form is always definite, defined by the definite article, a
pronoun suffix, or by being the first term of an √iDaafa. Moreover, it has a femi-
nine form as well: fuﬁlaa ≈∏r©oa. Because the feminine form ends with √alif
maqSuura, it does not inflect for case.

In some instances a dual form or plural form of the superlative may be used.
The plural form of the masculine superlative is either the sound masculine plural
√afﬁal-uuna, or CaCaaCiC ( faﬁaalilπpdÉ©na), a diptote plural pattern. The plural of the
feminine superlative is CuCCayaat ( fuﬁlayaat äÉ«n∏r©oa).

4.2.4.1 SUPERLATIVES IN CONTEXT: WORD ORDER: Superlative adjectives may
follow a noun directly, may be used as the first term of an √iDaafa with a noun, or
may have a pronoun suffix. In certain expressions, they occur alone, with the
definite article.
(1)
Following a definite noun: The superlative adjective may, like the ordi-
nary adjective, follow the noun. In that case, it agrees with the noun in
gender, number, definiteness, and case:

phrases, Arabic uses a superlative expression where English would use an
ordinary adjective:

As the first term of an √iDaafa with a singular, indefinite noun: The
superlative adjective is often used as the first term of an √iDaafa with a sin-
gular, indefinite noun as the second term. In this structure, the adjective
does not inflect for gender; it remains masculine singular no matter what
the gender of the noun.

As first term of an √iDaafa with a plural noun: When a superlative adjec-
tive is used as the first term of an √iDaafa with a plural noun, the noun is
normally definite, but may not always be. Normally the superlative adjec-
tive is in the masculine form, although the feminine may also occur.

5 The adjective √iDaafa, the “false” √iDaafa
(√iDaafa ghayr Haqiiqiyya á«≤«≤M ÒZ áaÉ°VEG)
The “adjective” √iDaafa is a particular use of the adjective as the first term of an √iDaafa
or annexation structure. The adjective may take the definite article if it modifies a
definite noun. Since this type of construct violates the general rules (by allowing the
first term of the √iDaafa to take a definite article), it is called “unreal” or “false.”
Adjectives: function and form
253

This kind of phrase is used to describe a distinctive quality of an item, equivalent
to hyphenated expressions in English such as fair-haired, long-legged, many-sided.
In this kind of √iDaafa, the adjective agrees with the noun it modifies in case,
number, and gender. The second term of the adjective √iDaafa is a definite noun in
the genitive case and refers to a particular property of the modified noun.9
5.1 Deﬁnite agreement
Here the adjective takes the definite article, agreeing with the noun it modifies.

5.2 Indeﬁnite agreement
Here the adjective √iDaafa modifies an indefinite noun. The adjective does not
therefore take a definite article but does not take nunation, either, because it is
the first term of an √iDaafa.

5.3 Adjective √iDaafa as predicate
When acting as a predicate adjective in an equational sentence, the adjective in
the adjective ’iDaafa lacks the definite article. For example:

huwa huulandiyy-u l-√aSl-i.

Part two: Adjective derivation: the structure of Arabic adjectives
Arabic adjectives are structured in two ways: through derivation from a lexical
root by means of the root-and-pattern system, or by means of attaching the nisba
254
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
9 For further discussion and examples of the adjective √iDaafa, see Chapter 8, section 1.9.2.

suffix -iyy (m.) or -iyya (f.) to create an adjective from another word (usually a noun).
Very rarely, an adjective will exist on its own, without relation to a lexical root.
In traditional Arabic grammar, adjectives and nouns both fall under the syn-
tactic category, ism ‘noun.’ The particular designations for the nomen adjectivum
(Wright 1967, I:105) in Arabic include al-waSf, ∞°UƒdG, al-Sifa áØ°üdG, and al-naﬁt
â©ædG, referring to qualities, attributes, and epithets.10 These types of words func-
tion in ways that very closely parallel what would be termed “adjectives” in
English, and many pedagogical texts refer to them simply as adjectives.
Active and passive participles may function either as adjectives or as nouns.
When they function as adjectives, they follow the same inflectional and syntactic
rules as adjectives, agreeing with the noun they modify in case, gender, number,
and definiteness.
1 Derivation patterns from Form I triliteral roots
These adjective forms are based on particular morphological patterns derived
from the base form of the verb, Form I. In some cases, an identical pattern may be
used for nouns as well.11 Some of the more commonly occurring adjectival pat-
terns include the following.12 Whereas the masculine plural patterns vary widely,
the feminine plural, when used, is usually the sound feminine plural.
1.1 The CaCiiC or faﬁiil π«©a pattern
This is one of the most common adjective patterns. The plural forms, used only for
human beings, may be several, including sometimes both sound plurals and bro-
ken plurals. The masculine plural applies to human males and to mixed groups of
males and females. The much more predictable feminine plural forms (ending in
/-aat/) apply to groups of female human beings. Some of the more frequently
occurring adjectives are as follows:

10 Beeston states: “One cannot establish for Arabic a word class of adjectives, syntactic considerations
being the only identificatory criterion of an adjective” (1970, 44).
11 For example, from the faﬁiil pattern come nouns such as waziir ‘minister,’ jaliid ‘ice,’ and safiir
‘ambassador.’
12 Wright 1967, I:131–40 gives an extensive description of these adjective patterns and uses. He refers to
them all as “verbal adjectives,” since he considers them derived from Form I verbs.  However, I prefer to
reserve the term “verbal adjectives” for active and passive particles, rather than adjectives in general.

1.1.1 With passive meaning
When derived from a transitive verb root, the faﬁiil pattern may carry the same
meaning as a passive participle.

13 The MECAS grammar (1965, 44) states for instance, that kaslaan is diptote, but it is not noted as
such in Wehr (1979, 969), although Wehr notes zaﬁlaan, ghaDbaan, and ﬁaTshaan as diptote. Wright
(1967, I:133) gives both alternatives; Haywood and Nahmad (1962, 86) state that this pattern is
“without nunation”; and Cowan (1964, 40) puts it in the diptote declension.

3 Participles functioning as adjectives
Active and passive participles are verbal adjectives, that is, descriptive terms
derived from a particular Form (I–X) of a verbal root. The active participle

describes the doer of an action and the passive participle describes the entity that
receives the action, or has the action done to it. They therefore describe or refer to
entities involved in an activity, either as noun modifiers (adjectives) or as sub-
stantives (nouns) themselves. Here we are dealing with them as adjectives.14
3.1 Active participles as adjectives
Active participles as adjectives describe the doer of an action. In context, they
agree with the modified noun in gender, number, definiteness, and case. When
used as adjectives modifying nouns referring to human beings in the plural, the
sound feminine or the sound masculine plural is used.15

4 Derivation through sufﬁxation: relative adjectives (al-nisba áÑ°ùædG)
Converting a noun, participle, or even an adjective into a relative adjective
through suffixation of the derivational morpheme -iyy (feminine -iyya) is an
important derivational process in MSA and is actively used to coin new terms. The
words used as stems for the nisba suffix can be Arabic or foreign, singular or plu-
ral. For the most part, their plurals are sound, except where noted.

4.4 Nisba from place names
A place name is usually stripped down to its barest, simplest stem form before the
nisba suffix is added. Definite articles, final long vowels, and final taa√marbuuTas
are generally eliminated. It is here that one can see the origin of English adjecti-
val terms ending in /-i/ such as ‘Yemeni’ and ‘Iraqi,’ which are modeled on the
Arabic nisba.

4.9 Nisbas from borrowed nouns
Derivation of an adjective from a borrowed noun is accomplished in several ways.
For example, the English word “diplomatic” is rendered in Arabic as diibu-
umaasiyy:
.»°SÉeƒ∏ÑjódG ∂∏°ùdG ó«ªY ƒg
huwa ﬁamiid-u l-silk-i l-diibluumaasiyy-i.
He is the dean of the diplomatic corps.
4.9.1 Nouns ending in -aa or -aa√
If the borrowed noun ends in -aa or -aa√, the final vowel may be deleted, or the
hamza deleted and the -aa buffered by a waaw: 
chemical q…hÉ«ª«c
kiimyaa-w-iyy ( from kiimyaa√AÉ«ª«c ‘chemistry’)
musical q»≤«°Sƒe
muusiiq-iyy ( from muusiiqaa ≈≤«°Sƒe ‘music’)
4.9.2 hamza insertion
The foreign noun ending in -aa may get an additional hamza as a buffer between
the stem and the suffix:
cinematic, film  q»FÉªæ«°S
siinamaa√-iyy (from siinamaa Éªæ«°S ‘movies, cinema’)
4.9.3 Intact stem
The foreign noun stem may be left intact and suffixed with -iyy:

4.10 Nisbas from borrowed adjectives
In the following words, an English adjective ending in “-ic” or a French adjective
ending in “-ique” has been borrowed and used as a stem. The nisba suffix is
attached to it in order to convert it into an Arabic adjective:

4.12 Nisbas from set phrases or ﬁxed expressions
Technically, in traditional Arabic grammar, a nisba adjective cannot be formed
from a phrase, only from a single word. Sometimes, however, a certain phrase is
used so often that it becomes a fixed expression, behaving semantically and

syntactically as a morphological unit or compound noun. The following phrases
and compound words with nisba suffixes occurred in data gathered for this
study.

4.13 Nisbas from compound words
Compounding has traditionally been a very minor component of Arabic deriva-
tional morphology, but it is resorted to more often in MSA, especially when there
is a requirement for coining technical terms. Relative adjectives are sometimes
created from these compound stems:17
capitalistic q‹Éª°SCGQ
ra√smaal-iyy (from ∫Ée ¢SCGQ ra√s maal ‘capital’)
amphibian q»FÉeôH
barmaa√-iyy (through compounding from the words barr ‘land’ and maa√‘water’)
Recently coined technical terms sometimes make use of the shortened forms of
qabl-a (qab-) ‘before’ and fawq-a ( faw-) ‘above’ to express the concepts of “pre-” and
“super-.” Sometimes these are combined with Arabic stems and sometimes with
stems from other languages, suffixed with -iyy:

1993.

4.14 Special use of nisba
Where in English one noun may be used to describe or modify another noun, in
Arabic such a phrase often uses a nisba adjective:
¿ƒq«©eÉL ÜÓW
¿ƒq«£Øf AGÈN
Tullaab-un jaamiﬁiyy-uuna

ﬁiZaam-un Hayawaaniyyat-un
manaaTiq-u zamaniyyat-un

time zones
4.15 Nisba plurals
The preponderance of nisba plurals are sound, using the sound masculine or sound
feminine plurals when referring to human beings. However, a few nisbas take bro-
ken or truncated plurals, especially when referring to ethnic or religious groups.

5 Color adjectives
Color adjectives are of three types in Arabic: pattern-derived, nisba, and borrowed. 
5.1 Pattern-derived color adjectives
The essential colors of the spectrum have a special pattern or form √aCCaC or √afﬁal
π©aCG in the masculine singular, CaCCaa√or faﬁlaa√- AÓ©a in the feminine singular,
and CuCC or fuﬁl π©a in the plural. Here is a list of the most commonly occurring
derived color adjectives. It includes black and white and brown as well as the pri-
mary colors: red, blue and yellow. It also includes green, but not orange or purple.
There are three things to note and remember about these color adjectives. First,
the masculine singular pattern √afﬁal is diptote and is identical in form to the
comparative adjective pattern (for example, √akbar ‘bigger’ or √aTwal ‘longer’),
which is also diptote. Second, the feminine singular pattern faﬁlaa√is also diptote.
Third, the plural form is primarily used to refer to human beings, since the femi-
nine singular would be used for modifying a nonhuman noun plural, in keeping
with rules of gender and humanness agreement.18 Examples include:
18 One instance of the plural form of the adjective used with a nonhuman plural noun appeared in

5.3 Nisba color adjectives
Another process for deriving names of colors in Arabic is to identify the color of a
naturally occurring substance, such as ashes, roses, oranges, or coffee beans, and
then to affix the nisba ending -iyy onto that noun. Sometimes the base noun is of
Arabic origin, and sometimes it is of foreign derivation.

Inflection of these nisba adjectives follows the general rules for nisbas: adding a
taa√marbuuTa for feminine agreement (including nonhuman plurals), and adding
the sound masculine or sound feminine plural for plural (human) agreement.

5.4 Borrowed color adjectives
In recent times, the practice has been to borrow directly names of certain colors
or particular shades of colors that do not already exist in Arabic. These come
mainly from European languages and do not inflect for number, gender, or case:

6 Non-derived adjectives
Rarely, an Arabic adjective is non-derived and simply exists on its own, without
relation to a productive lexical root:

7 Compound adjectives
In order to express complex new concepts, compound (two-word) adjectival
expressions are sometimes used in MSA. They occur primarily as adjective
√iDaafas, or, for negative concepts, as adjectives in construct with the noun ghayr.
7.1 The active participle mutaﬁaddid Oqó©àe ‘numerous’ 
To express the concept of “multi-” as the first component of an Arabic compound,
the AP mutaﬁaddid is normally used.

7.2 The noun ghayr ﬁnon-; un-, in-, other than’ 
To express negative or privative concepts denoting absence of a quality or attrib-
ute, the noun ghayr is used.
The noun ghayr ‘other than’ becomes the first term of a construct phrase modi-
fying the noun and carries the same case ending as the noun being modified. It
does not, as the first term of the √iDaafa, ever have the definite article. The second

275
term of the construct is an adjective or participle in the genitive case which
agrees with the noun being modified in gender, number, and definiteness. See
also Chapter 8, section 1.9.3.

A good general definition of adverbs is found in Hurford (1994, 10): “The most
typical adverbs add specific information about time, manner, or place to the
meanings of verbs or whole clauses.” Adverbs may also add information to adjec-
tives (“very easy”) or even other adverbs (“late yesterday”). An essential characteris-
tic of adverbs is that they are additive; that is, they are external to the core propo-
sition in a clause or sentence. They are, as Stubbs has noted, “an optional element
in clause structure” (1983, 70).
Arabic refers to this optional status as faDla á∏°†a ‘extra’ or ‘surplus’ parts of a
sentence rather than part of the kernel or core predication. This optionality has
meant that adverbs have traditionally received less attention from linguistic
research than the major form classes (nouns and verbs), despite the fact that they
are very common in both spoken and written discourse.1
This class of words and phrases is also very heterogeneous in terms of its
composition. Adverbial modification may be accomplished with single words
(daa√im-ankÉªFGO ‘always,’ jidd-ankGqóL ‘very’) or with phrases (√ilaa Hadd-in maaÉe qóM ¤EG
‘to a certain extent,’ ﬁaajil-an √aw √aajil-an kÓLBG hCG kÓLÉY ‘sooner or later’). Arabic
adverbials also include grammatical structures such as the cognate accusative
(al-mafﬁuul al-muTlaq ≥∏£ŸG ∫ƒ©ØŸG) and Haal ∫ÉM (‘circumstantial’) phrases.
In Arabic, few words are adverbs in and of themselves; but there are some (such
as faqaTr§≤a ‘only’ or hunaaÉæg ‘here’).2 Most words that function as Arabic adverbs
are adjectives or nouns in the accusative case (e.g., √aHyaan-an kÉfÉ«MCG ‘sometimes,’

Adverbs and adverbial expressions
1 Stubbs notes that adverbs are one of three areas which have resisted traditional treatment in
grammar (in addition to coordinating conjunctions and “particles”) and that none of these areas
“fit neatly into the syntactic and semantic categories of contemporary linguistics” (1983, 70).
Furthermore, he states (1983, 77): “Adverbs then, and certain items in particular, provide problems
for sentence based grammars but are of great interest in a study of discourse sequences, since
their functions are largely to do with the organization of connected discourse, and with the
interpretation of functional categories of speech acts.”
2 Cowan (1964, 63) starts his section on adverbs with the observation that “the Arabic language is
exceedingly poor in adverbs,” referring to the fact that few Arabic words are inherently and solely
adverbs. Haywood and Nahmad (1962, 426) open their chapter on “adverbial usage” with the
statement: “Arabic has no Adverbs, properly speaking” (emphasis in original). They go on to explain
that “this lack is hardly felt owing to the inherent flexibility and expressiveness of the language.”

Adverbs and adverbial expressions
277
ghad-an kGóZ ‘tomorrow,’ al-yawm-a ‘today’ nΩƒ«dG); some adverbials occur with a
Damma ending (e.g., baﬁd-u oó©H ‘yet’) and at least one ends consistently in kasra (√ams-i
p¢ùeCG ‘yesterday’). Still other adverbial expressions are compound words consisting
of a noun and a demonstrative suffix, e.g., yawm-a-dhaak ∑Gòneƒj ‘that day.’3
Placement of adverbs within an Arabic sentence is flexible to a certain extent,
but sometimes particular adverbs have preferred positions. Several adverbs or
adverbial expressions may occur in the same sentence. In the following one, for
example, are four adverbs:
.´ƒ°VƒŸG ∫ƒM äÉaÓN Óãe Ωƒ«dG ∑Éæg
hunaaka l-yawm-a mathal-an xilaafaat-un Hawl-a l-mawDuuﬁ-i.
There [are] today, for example, disagreements about the subject.
The first adverb is the locative hunaaka n∑Éæg, ‘there is/are’; the second is the
time adverbial l-yawm-a nΩƒ«dG ‘today’; the third is mathal-an kÓãe ‘for example’;
and the fourth is the locative adverb Hawl-a n∫ƒM ‘about.’
Most Arabic adverbials can be divided into four major groups according to
their semantic function: degree, manner, place, and time. There are also some
important categories that do not fall within these four groups, but which have key
functions in Arabic, such as adverbial accusatives of cause or reason (mafﬁuul li-
√ajl-i-hi ¬∏LC’ ∫ƒ©Øe or mafﬁuul la-hu ¬d ∫ƒ©Øe) and the accusative of specification
(tamyiiz õ««“). Within each of these categories there are several kinds of adverbial
components. Given the heterogeneous and multifunctional nature of this class of
expressions, the examples provided here are by no means exhaustive; but they
represent a broad sample of occurrences in modern written Arabic.
1 Adverbs of degree
Adverbs of degree describe and quantify concepts such as intensity (“very,”
“considerably,” “particularly”), measurement (“one by one”), or amount (“a little,”
“a great deal,” “completely”). In some respects, they are a subcategory of manner
adverbials, but they constitute a substantial group of their own.
1.1 Basic adverbs of degree
1.1.1 faqaT r§≤a ‘only, solely’
This adverb of degree is a commonly used expression of limitation. It is invari-
able in form and ends with sukuun. In terms of its placement in a sentence, it
3 In discussing the Arabic morphological category of adverb, Wright (1967, I:282) notes that “there
are three sorts of adverbs. The first class consists of particles of various origins, partly inseparable,
partly separable; the second class of indeclinable nouns ending in u; the third class of nouns in the
accusative” (emphasis in original). He includes an exhaustive list of particles, including interroga-
tives, negatives, and tense markers in his first category. In this book these particles are discussed
according to their separate functions.

1.2 Degree nouns and adjectives in the accusative
Adverbial modification is often managed in Arabic using nouns or adjectives in
the accusative case. Certain accusative adverbials are used so frequently that they
have become idiomatic. This is especially true of degree adverbials. Note that most
of them occur in the indefinite accusative.
1.2.1 jidd-an GqóL ‘very’
This adverbial expression is of frequent occurrence in written Arabic. It follows
the phrase that it modifies.

gradual sequencing.

or ‘inflexible Haal.’

2 Adverbs of manner
Manner adverbials provide a wide range of options for describing the state,
condition, circumstances, manner, or way in which something is accomplished or
happens.
2.1 Basic adverbs of manner
The members of this group are related to demonstrative pronouns.

2.2 Nouns and adjectives in the accusative
Many nouns and adjectives are used in the accusative case to amplify a statement
adverbially. Adverbs of manner are the most frequent, but many accusative adver-
bials do not fit that category precisely. In most cases, the indefinite accusative is
used on the singular base form of the noun or adjective.

2.3 Manner adverbial phrases
There are four general ways to express manner adverbials in phrases: using the
Haal structures, the cognate accusative, other accusative phrases, and prepositional
phrases.
2.3.1 The circumstantial construction: al-Haal ∫É◊G
The Haal (literally ‘state’ or ‘condition’) or circumstantial accusative structure is a
way of expressing the circumstances under which an action takes place. It is often
structured using an active participle in the indefinite accusative to modify or
describe the circumstances of the action. The participle agrees with the doer of
the action in number and gender.7
.kÉ°ùeÉg ¬dCÉ°S
.kÉYô°ùe ÖàµŸG ∑ôJh
sa√al-a-hu haamis-an.
wa-tarak-a l-maktab-a musriﬁ-an. 
He asked him, whispering.
He left the office quickly/in a hurry.
.kGOôØæe áÁô÷G √òg ÖµJQG ób
qad-i rtakab-a haadhihi l-jariimat-a munfarid-an.
He committed this crime on his own/alone (‘individually’).
2.3.1.1 If the Haal active participle is from a transitive verb, it may take a noun
object in the accusative case:
.ájQƒ¡ª÷G ¢ù«FQ kÓã‡ ô“DƒŸG íààaGh
wa-ftataH-a l-mu√tamar-a mumaththil-an ra√iis-a l-jumhuuriyyat-i.
He opened the conference representing the president of the republic.
.ÚdhDƒ°ùŸG ¢†©H  kÉª¡àe Öàµj
ya-ktub-u muttahim-an baﬁD-a l-mas√uul-iina.
He writes accusing some officials.
2.3.1.2 Occasionally, a passive participle is used in the Haal structure:
.kIQƒYòe âõab
qafaz-at madhﬁuurat-an.
She jumped, frightened.
7 For more examples and discussion of the Haal circumstantial structure in modern written Arabic,
see Abboud and McCarus (1983) Part I:535–39, and Cantarino (1975) II:186–96 and III:242–54.

284
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
2.3.1.3 An adjective may also be used in the circumstantial accusative structure.
.kGÒ¨°U »eCG äó≤a
faqad-tu √umm-ii Saghir-an.
I lost my mother [when I was] young.
2.3.1.4 The circumstantial accusative is occasionally expressed with a verbal
noun in the accusative:8
.ÒØ°ùdG øY  káHÉ«f áª∏c ≈≤dCG
√alqaa kalimat-an niyaabat-an ﬁan-i l-safiir-i.
He gave a speech in place of (‘substituting for’) the ambassador.
. . . ∫GDƒ°ù  ≈∏Y kGqOQ ∫Ébh
. . . çOÉ◊G ≈∏Y kÉ≤«∏©Jh
wa-qaal-a radd-an ﬁalaa su√aal-in . . .

he said, responding to a question . . .

. . . Úeó≤dG ≈∏Y kGÒ°S . . . π«àZCG ób ¿Éch
wa-kaan-a qad ughtiil-a . . . sayr-an ﬁalaa l-qadam-ayni . . .
He had been assassinated [while] walking (‘on two feet’) . . .
2.3.1.5 Haal EXPRESSING CAPACITY OR FUNCTION: A noun or participle may be
used in the accusative to express the idea of “in the capacity of ” or “as”:
.kÉq«HOCG GkQôﬁπª©j
ya-ﬁmal-u muHarrir-an √adabiyy-an.
He works as a literary editor.
2.3.1.6 Haal CLAUSE WITH waaw hGh (waaw al-Haal ∫É◊G hGh): Another way of
expressing the circumstances under which an action takes place is to use the
connecting particle wa- followed by a pronoun and a clause describing the
circumstances.
.Ö£◊G ™£≤j  ƒgh ÅLƒah
wa-fuuji√-a wa-huwa ya-qTaﬁ-u l-HaTab-a.
He was surprised while he was cutting wood.
.kÉq«eÓ°SEG  kÉqjR ¿ÉjóJôj Éªgh ÓNO
daxal-aa wa-humaa ya-rtadiy-aani ziyy-an √islaamiyy-an.
The two of them entered wearing Islamic garb.
8 Cantarino (1975, II:193-96) lists five form classes that may be used with the circumstantial
accusative: adjectives, active participles, passive participles, substantives, or “infinitives” 
(i.e., maSdars; verbal nouns).

.m≥jôW  íàa ∫hÉëj ƒgh ¬«∏Y Iôé°T  â£≤°S
saqaT-at shajarat-un ﬁalay-hi wa-huwa yu-Haawil-u fatH-a Tariiq-in.
A tree fell on him while he was trying to open a road.
2.3.1.7 Haal WITH PAST TENSE: If the circumstances referred to by the Haal
structure precede the action noted by the main verb, and especially if they form a
background for the main verb, the waaw al-Haal is used with qad and a past tense
verb. Abboud and McCarus state that “this construction indicates a completed
action whose results are still in effect” (1985, Part I:537).
.»Hô©dG …OÉædG ¬ªq¶f óbh . . . ÊÉãdG ô“DƒŸG ¢ùeCG ≈¡àfG
intahaa √ams-i l-mu√tamar-u l-thaanii . . . . wa-qad naZZam-a-hu l-naadii l-ﬁarabiyy-u.
Yesterday the second conference ended . . . having been organized by the 
Arabic club (‘the Arabic club having organized it’).
2.3.1.8 Haal CLAUSES WITHOUT waaw: In yet another form of Haal, a main verb may
be followed directly by another verb that gives a further description of either the
agent or the object of the main verb. Most often, the main verb is past tense and
the following verb in the present tense, but not always.
. . . ∫ƒ≤j  ≈°†eh
.AÓW ¢Tôj  ¬JógÉ°T
wa-maDaa ya-quul-u
shaahad-at-hu ya-rushsh-u Talaa√-an.
He went on, saying . . . 
She saw him spattering paint.
.ô¶àæJ  n∂cÎJ ’
laa ta-truk-u-ka ta-ntaZir-u.
It does not leave you waiting.
2.3.2 The cognate accusative: al-mafﬁuul al-muTlaq ≥∏£ŸG∫ƒ©ØŸG
The cognate accusative is an elegant way of emphasizing or enhancing a previ-
ous statement by deriving a verbal noun from the main verb or predicate (which
may also be in the form of a participle or verbal noun) and modifying the
derived verbal noun with an adjective that intensifies the effect of the state-
ment. The verbal noun and its modifying adjective are usually in the indefinite
accusative.

the verbal noun as the second term of an √iDaafa construction whose first term is
a qualifier or quantifier in the accusative case:

2.3.4 Other phrasal manner adverbials
Phrases that function adverbially are of two sorts: accusative adverbials or prepo-
sitional phrases.
2.3.4.1 waHd-a nórMnh  PRONOUN SUFFIX ‘ALONE, BY ONE’S SELF’: The adverbial
expression waHd-a plus pronoun suffix is used in apposition with a noun to
indicate or specify the meaning of ‘alone,’ ‘on one’s own,’ or ‘by one’s self.’ It is
invariably in the accusative case, no matter what case its head noun is in, and is
suffixed with a personal pronoun that refers back to the head noun.

2.3.4.2 PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES: A prepositional phrase may function as manner
adverbial.
(1)
bi- `H or fii ‘: The preposition bi- is often used with a noun to modify a verb
phrase by describing the manner in which an action takes place. 
.¿ƒæéH É¡qÑMCG
.âª°üH É¡«dEG ô¶æj
√aHabb-a-haa bi-junuun-in.
ya-nZur-u √ilay-haa bi-Samt-in.

He looks at her in silence/silently.

rafaD-at-i l-mashruuﬁ-a bi-shiddat-in.
taﬁaal-a bi-surﬁat-in!
It refused the plan forcefully.
Come quickly!
When indicating manner, bi- or fii are sometimes prefixed to a noun such
as Suura ‘manner,’ Tariiqa ‘way,’ or shakl ‘form’ followed by a modifier that
provides the exact description of the manner:
™°SGƒdG πµ°ûdG Gò¡H

3 Place adverbials
3.1 One-word adverbs of place
3.1.1 hunaa Éæog and hunaaka n∑Éæog ‘here’ and ‘there’
These two adverbs are deictic locatives, that is, they indicate proximity or
remoteness from the speaker. They are also considered locative pronouns. In
addition to indicating relative distance, the adverb hunaaka n∑Éæog ‘there’ is used
figuratively for existential predications to indicate the concept “there is” or
“there are.” These adverbs are invariable; they always end with fatHa. A variant of
hunaaka ∑Éæog indicating slightly greater distance is hunaalika n∂pdÉæog ‘(over) there.’
3.1.1.1 hunaa Éæg ‘HERE’
.º∏◊G CGóÑj Éæg

3.1.1.4 hunaalika ∂dÉæg: This variant of hunaaka is very similar in meaning
although sometimes it indicates a more remote distance (actual or figurative).

connects one clause with another. It has an invariable Damma suffix.9

tion or location.
?k’Éª°T hCG  kÉæ«Á äô°S πg

3.3 Locative adverbs or semi-prepositions (Zuruuf makaan 
wa-Zuruuf zamaan ¿ÉeR ±hôXh ¿Éµe ±hôX)
These adverbs are actually nouns of location marked with the accusative case,
functioning as the first term of an √iDaafa, with a following noun in the genitive,
or with a pronoun suffix. The location may be spatial or temporal. Although close
9 Note that the question word “where?” is different: √ayna nøjCG (see Chapter 17, section 1); see also
Chapter 18, section 6.1.

to prepositions in both meaning and function, these words are of substantive
(usually triliteral root) origin and may inflect for genitive case if they are pre-
ceded by a true preposition.10

4 Time adverbials
Adverbial expressions of time fall into four categories: basic adverbs, single nouns
and adjectives in the accusative, compound time demonstratives, and phrases.
4.1 Basic adverbs of time
These words denote particular points in time and tend to remain in one form
without inflecting for case or definiteness.
4.1.1 √ams-i ¢ùeCG ‘yesterday’
The invariable adverb √ams-i is unusual in that it ends in kasra. It does not take nuna-
tion even when it lacks the definite article. According to Wright, the kasra is not a
case ending, but an anaptyctic vowel, added to ease pronunciation.11 In terms of
placement within a sentence, it is flexible because it is a short word and it is often
inserted prior to a longer phrase; the only place it does not occur is in initial position.
10 See also Chapter 16 on prepositions and semi-prepositions, section 3.
11 “The kesra is not the mark of the genitive but merely a light vowel, added to render the
pronunciation easy” Wright 1967, I:290. Note that if the definite article is attached to √ams, it
becomes fully inflectable.

.p¢ùeC’ÉH ∑GP ¿Éc

That was yesterday.
4.1.1.2 Because it is used adverbially, √ams-i is considered to be a “virtual”
accusative (despite the presence of kasra), so that when it has a modifier, or noun
in apposition, that modifier or noun is in the accusative case:
n∫qhC’G p¢ùeCG ÉgòqØf IQÉZ ‘
fii ghaarat-in naffadh-a-haa √ams-i l-√awwal-a
in a raid it carried out the day before yesterday
4.1.2 al-√aan-a n¿B’G ‘now’
The expression al-√aan-a is invariable as an adverb, remaining in the accusative
even after a preposition:
!n¿B’G íàaG
.ÉcÎ°ûe ∫ÉªYCG ∫hóL n¿B’G ¿Gójôj
iftaH-i l-√aan-a!

wa-Zahar-a Hattaa l-√aan-a xamsat-un wa-xamsuuna ﬁadad-an min-a l-majallat-i.
Up to now 55 issues of the magazine have appeared.
4.1.3 baﬁd-u oó©H ‘yet; still’ 
The word baﬁd-u, with the Damma inflection and no nunation, acts as an adverb in
negative clauses to mean ‘not. . . yet,’ ‘still . . . not.’ When inflected with the
Damma, it cannot be the first term of a genitive construct.12
12 The Damma is not thought to represent the nominative case here but is rather an archaic form of
Semitic locative “un ancien cas adverbial en -u qui n’est pas le nominatif” (Lecomte 1968, 90).
Similar forms such as qabl-u ‘before,’fawq-u ‘above,’ and taHt-u ‘beneath’ also exist, with the
restriction that they may not occur as the first term of an √iDaafa. On this topic see also Fleisch
1961, I:280, and Chapter 16, section 3.4.3.

4.4 Adverbial time phrases
A noun denoting either a point in time or a period of time may occur in the
accusative to denote that it is functioning adverbially. The nouns may be indefi-
nite or definite, depending on the structure. For an expression of time in general,
the indefinite accusative is used:
.kGQÉ¡fh kÓ«d ≈©°ùj
ya-sﬁaa layl-an wa-nahaar-an.
He hurries night and day.
For specific expressions of time the accusative may be used with demonstrative
pronouns, the definite article, as first term of an √iDaafa, or in a prepositional
phrase.
.¥ÉØJ’G Gòg πãe ™«bƒJ ‘ náæ°ùdG √òg í‚

6 Adverbial accusative of speciﬁcation (al-tamyiiz õ««ªàdG)
This form of adverbial accusative is used to label, identify, or specify something
previously referred to in the sentence.13 It specifies the nature of what has been
mentioned by answering the question “in what way?” Often an equivalent English
structure might include the terms “as” or “in terms of.”

8 Adverbs as speech acts
A few Arabic adverbs are used both in speech and in writing to function as
performatives, that is, to accomplish acts such as thanking, welcoming, pardon-
ing, and so forth. A number of these are words and phrases in the indefinite
accusative. These include:
‘thank you’
shukr-an
kGôµ°T
‘pardon; you’re welcome’
ﬁafw-an
kGƒØY

Personal pronouns refer to persons or entities and stand on their own as substi-
tutes for nouns or noun phrases. This word class fills a wide range of roles in
Arabic and consists of three groups: subject, object, and possessive pronouns. The
first group, subject pronouns, are independent, separate words; the other two
groups both take the form of suffixes.
The personal pronouns show differences in gender (masculine and feminine),
number (singular, dual, plural), and person (first, second, and third). However, the
number of categories of personal pronouns in Arabic is larger than in English (12
as opposed to 8) because it includes both masculine and feminine forms of the
second and third person, and it also includes the dual pronouns.
1 Independent personal pronouns (Damaa√ir munfaSila á∏°üØæe ôFÉª°V)
The independent pronouns are also referred to as subject pronouns since they can
serve as the subjects of verbs or of equational sentences and they correspond to
the set of English subject pronouns. They are as follows:1
12
Personal pronouns
1 There is no neutral pronoun “it,” since there is no neutral gender in Arabic. Everything is referred
to as either masculine or feminine. Note that the third person feminine singular pronoun, in
keeping with the agreement rules of Arabic, is used to refer to nonhuman plurals.

Personal pronouns
299
The masculine plural pronouns √antum rºàfCG and hum rºg end with sukuun, which
means that they require a helping vowel if they are followed directly by a cluster
of two or more consonants (often the case with a following word that starts with
the definite article). That helping vowel is Damma, based on a principle of vowel
harmony with the previous vowel.

1.1 Independent personal pronouns: functions
This form of the pronoun is used in a number of different ways, sometimes as an
essential part of a clause and sometimes as a nonessential part.
1.1.1 To emphasize the subject of a verb
Because Arabic verbs incorporate the subject into their inflections, the independ-
ent personal pronoun is not necessary to mark the subject of a verb phrase.2 How-
ever, the pronoun may be used along with the verb in order to fortify or empha-
size the subject. In the following sentences, the independent pronoun could be
omitted and the sentence would still be grammatically correct; however, the
emphasis on the subject would be reduced.

2 Arabic is a “pro-drop” language; i.e., it is a language that allows a separate pronominal subject to
be left unexpressed. This feature results in the verb inflectional paradigm distinguishing all per-
sons uniquely. See Chapter 21 on verb inflection, esp. note 1.
3 When preceded by the conjunctions wa- or fa-, the third person singular pronouns huwa and hiya
may lose their first vowel, thus becoming wa-hwa nƒrgnh and wa-hya n»rgnh.

1.1.2 Subject of an equational sentence
Equational or verbless sentences do not have an overt verb, but they may show a
subject through use of a pronoun. Used in this way, the pronoun is usually the
first element in the sentence.
.§°ShC’G ¥ô°ûdG ¿hDƒ°T ‘ ÒÑN ƒg

1.1.3 Predicate of equational sentence
Less common is the use of a subject pronoun as the predicate of an equational
sentence; for example,
.ƒg Gòg
.»g âfCG
haadhaa huwa.
√anti hiyya.
This is he.
You are she.
1.1.4 As a copula
In order to clarify the relationship between the subject and predicate of an equa-
tional sentence, especially when the predicate is a definite noun or noun phrase,
a third person subject pronoun may be inserted between the subject and predi-
cate as a way of linking these two parts of the sentence, and as a substitute for the
verb “to be.” When functioning in this manner, it is said to be a copula.4
.QÉ©°SC’G ƒg èYõŸG ó«MƒdG A»°ûdG
.IOƒ©dG ƒg º¡ŸG

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
4 As Hurford puts it, “In English, a copula is any form of the verb be used as a ‘link’ or ‘coupling’
between its subject and a following phrase. The link either expresses identity or describes some
property or attribute of the subject (Copula is Latin for link.)” 1994, 51. Because the verb “to be” in
Arabic is not expressed overtly in present tense indicative sentences, an independent pronoun
sometimes serves that purpose. For an excellent analysis of the Arabic pronoun copula, see Eid 1991.

2 Sufﬁx personal pronouns (Damaa√ir muttaSila á∏°üàe ôFÉª°V)
There are two sets of suffix pronouns, one set indicates possession (possessive
pronouns) and is suffixed to nouns, and the other set indicates the object of a verb
or object of a preposition (object pronouns).
Although the two sets are different in their distribution and in their meanings,
in form they are almost exactly alike. The only formal difference between them is in
the first person singular pronoun (‘my’ or ‘me’), which when it indicates possession
and is suffixed to a noun, is /-ii/, but when it indicates the object of a verb is -nii »æ`.
2.1 Possessive pronoun sufﬁxes
These suffixes are attached to nouns to show possession. They agree with the gender
and number of the possessor (as in English), not the thing possessed (as in French).

These suffixes are attached at the end of a noun, after the case-marking vowel,
except for the suffix -ii ‘my’ which supercedes any inflectional vowel.5 A noun
with a pronoun suffix is considered definite, the suffix acting like the second
term of an annexation structure to define the noun. When a personal pronoun
suffix is used, the noun cannot have the definite article (it is definite by virtue of
5 Note that all the pronoun suffixes except -ii start with a consonant; that is why they can follow
directly after a vowel. Since /-ii/ consists of a long vowel only, it cannot follow or combine with
another vowel.  Instead, it replaces any short inflectional vowel.

indefinite).
Note that words ending in taa√marbuuTa and pronounced with a final /-a/ in
pause form shift their spelling to a regular taa√when they are suffixed with a per-
sonal pronoun, since the taa√is no longer final.

2.1.1 Vowel shift pronouns
The third person suffix pronouns that include the sequence -hu (-hu, -humaa, -hum,
-hunna) are affected by any front vowel (-i or -ii) or yaa√that precedes them. Their -u
vowel shifts to /-i/ in vowel harmony with the preceding sound. Other vowels (-a or -u)
do not affect these suffixes:

2.1.2 Plural pronoun sufﬁx helping vowel
The masculine plural pronoun suffixes, -kum and -hum/-him, end with a sukuun,
which means that they need a helping vowel if followed directly by a cluster of
two or more consonants. That vowel is Damma, based on a principle of vowel har-
mony with the previous vowel. If the third person plural suffix pronoun shifts
from -hum to -him, the helping vowel may be either Damma or kasra.6

2.1.3 Noun  pronoun sufﬁx  adjective
When a noun plus pronoun suffix is modified by an attributive adjective, that
adjective is definite and carries the definite article because the noun is consid-
ered definite. The adjective also agrees in number, gender, and case with the mod-
ified noun.

2.1.4 Pronoun sufﬁxes on dual and sound masculine plural nouns
Nouns with the dual suffix (-aani/-ayni) or with the sound masculine plural suffix
(-uuna/-iina) drop the nuun when a pronoun suffix is attached:

2.1.4.1 SOUND MASCULINE PLURAL SUFFIX PLUS /-ii/ ‘MY’: The sound masculine
plural (-uuna or -iina), as noted above, drops the nuun when a suffix pronoun is
attached, leaving a long vowel /-uu/ or /-ii/. Because of restrictions on vowel
combinations, adding the pronoun -ii causes a shift in these endings. They are
shortened and combined into one, with a short vowel kasra (-i) followed by a double
yaa√with fatHa: -iyya s…. Note that when (-ii) ‘my’ is suffixed to sound masculine
plural nouns it overrides the case distinction and the plural is reduced to only one
form.7

2.1.4.2 DUAL SUFFIX PLUS /-ii/: The dual suffix (-aani or -ayni) drops the nuun when
a suffix pronoun is attached, leaving a long vowel -aa or the diphthong -ay. Owing
to restrictions on the combination of two long vowels in Arabic, the long vowel
suffix /-ii/ is shifted to /-ya/ in both cases: nominative -aaya n…G and genitive/
accusative -ayya s….
304

2.1.5 The ﬁve nouns plus /-ii/: √ab, √ax, fuu, Ham, dhuu)
These five nouns are a special subset of semantically primitive nouns that inflect
for case with long vowels instead of short vowels whenever they have pronoun
suffixes or when they are used as the first term of an √iDaafa (see Chapter 5, sec-
tion 10.1.3). Except for dhuu, which does not take pronoun suffixes, when used
with the possessive suffix /-ii/ ‘my,’ all three cases are neutralized into one form,
with omission of the inflectional vowel, e.g.,

2.2 Object pronoun sufﬁxes
Object pronouns are suffixes almost identical in form with the possessive pro-
noun suffixes. They serve as objects of transitive verbs and of prepositions and
therefore are affixed to those word classes.

These suffixes are attached at the end of a verb, after the verb inflection for per-
son, number, gender, tense, and mood. Just as with possessive pronoun suffixes,
the third person suffix pronouns that include the sequence -hu- (-hu, -humaa, -hum,
-hunna) are affected by any front vowel (-i or -ii) or yaa√that precedes them. Their -u
vowel shifts to -i in vowel harmony with the preceding sound. Other vowels (-a or -u)
do not affect these suffixes.

2.2.1.1 SECOND PERSON PLURAL HELPING VOWEL: Whenever a pronoun suffix is
attached to the second person masculine plural form of a past tense verb (ending
in -tum), a long helping vowel -uu is inserted between the verb suffix and the
pronoun object suffix.

verb, and the verb-initial word order in Arabic sentences, sometimes the object of
a verb in Arabic comes before the mention of the subject.

2.2.1.4 NOTE ABOUT WORD STRESS: Because suffix pronouns are attached to the
ends of words, and because word stress is calculated by syllables from the end of
a word, the suffixing of a personal pronoun lengthens a word and may cause a
shift in stress when the words are spoken or pronounced out loud. (See stress
rules in Chapter 2, section 7.) For example (stressed syllable is boldface):

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
2.2.2 Object pronoun carrier: ÉqjEG √iyyaa-
Rarely, in MSA, a pronoun object of a verb will occur and not be attached to the
verb. This may happen if the verb is one that takes a double object (direct and indi-
rect) and both of the objects are pronouns, or it may occur as a stylistic choice. For
these cases, there is a word that acts as a pronoun-carrier, √iyyaa-, and object pro-
nouns can be attached to it.9
2.2.2.1 VERB THAT TAKES DOUBLE ACCUSATIVE:
.»≤jó°U πgCG ÉgÉjEG ÊGógCG
.√ÉjEG »æ«£YCG
√ahdaa-nii √iyyaa-haa √ahl-u Sadiiq-ii.
√aﬁTii-nii √iyyaa-hu.
My friend’s family presented it to me
Give (f.) it [to] me (‘give me it’).
(‘sent-me it’).
2.2.2.2 STYLISTIC CHOICE: In the following example, the writer could have said
‘taHaddath-a maﬁ-a-hu,’ but he chose a more classical turn of phrase, using the expres-
sion wa-√iyaa-hu instead. In this case, wa- is a connector which takes the accusa-
tive case (waaw al-maﬁiyya) on a following noun, signifying concomitance
or accompaniment.10 Since a pronoun object is needed here, wa- is followed by
√iyyaa-hu.
.’ƒ£e √ÉjEGh çqó–
taHaddath-a wa-√iyyaa-hu muTawwil-an.
He talked with him for a long time.
2.3 Pronoun objects of prepositions and semi-prepositions
Prepositions may take pronoun objects. The form of the object pronouns of prepo-
sitions is almost exactly identical to the pronoun objects of verbs.11
As objects of prepositions, the suffix pronouns attach directly onto the prepo-
sition itself. Sometimes a spelling change is required, however.
This subset of pronouns is as follows:
9 See Wright 1967, I:103–104 for more on the use of √iyyaa-. Note also that in Classical Arabic it was
possible to have both direct and indirect objects as suffixes on the verb. Lecomte states (1968, 106):
“La langue ancienne, surtout poétique, admettait l’agglutination des pronoms dans l’ordre des
personnes 123: √aﬁTay-tu-ka-hu je te l’ai donné; depuis l’époque classique, le second pronom s’af-
fixe toujours à une particule-outil √iyyaa-.”
10 For more on waaw al-maﬁiyya see Baalbaki 1986 and Wright 1967, II:83–84.
11 Note, however that the prepositions Hattaa, ka-, and mundh-u do not take pronoun objects.

2.3.2 Two-letter prepositions: ﬁi, min, ﬁan
2.3.2.1 ﬁi + PRONOUN SUFFIX: The preposition fii ‘in, at, into,’ because it ends in
a long vowel -ii, undergoes a slight change when suffixed with the first person
object pronoun -ii; the two long vowels merge into each other and become a yaa√
with a shadda on it, followed by the short vowel fatHa: fiyya s‘. In writing it is
sometimes hard to tell the difference between fii and fiyya, but there is often a
marked shadda added to the yaa√when fiyya is intended.
Otherwise, pronouns simply follow the long -ii, with the “vowel shift pronouns”
changing their -u vowel to -i:
.s‘  ¿õ◊G ÜGPCG
.á«∏ÑL ¢ùª°T p¬«a

2.3.2.2 min + PRONOUN SUFFIX: The preposition min ‘of; from; than’ is fairly
regular in its shape when pronoun suffixes are attached, except that when
suffixed with the pronoun -ii ‘me,’ the nuun in min doubles, so that instead of
*min-ii, the phrase ‘from me’ or ‘than me’ becomes min-nii.

when suffixed with the pronoun -ii ‘me,’ the nuun in ﬁan doubles, so that instead
of *ﬁan-ii, the phrase ‘from me’ or ‘away from me’ becomes ﬁan-nii.

2.3.3 Defective three-letter prepositions: √ilaa, ﬁalaa and semi-preposition ladaa
These three words are put in one category because they all have a final √alif maq-
Suura, and all of them shift this √alif to a yaa√preceded by fatHa whenever they
receive pronoun suffixes. Thus the attachable stem for √ilaa is √ilay-; for ﬁalaa it is
ﬁalay- and for ladaa, laday-.
The shift to yaa√has an effect on certain pronoun suffixes. The “vowel-shift”
pronouns change their -u vowel to -i, and the first person singular suffix -ii ‘me’
merges with the yaa√of the preposition stem, creating a double yaa√, which is fol-
lowed by fatHa. A model paradigm using ﬁalaa is presented here.

suffix, the pronoun referring back to the subject of the verb.

4 Independent possessive pronoun: dhuu + noun
This pronoun refers to the possessor or owner of something and is used for express-
ing descriptive concepts where English would use the word “of” plus a noun, such
as “of importance” “of means.” It is also used for descriptive terms such as “bald-
headed” or “two-humped” when describing creatures in terms of their distinctive
features. It is used chiefly in conjunction with a noun, as first term of an √iDaafa
with that noun. Occasionally it is followed by a pronoun suffix. The masculine
form, dhuu, is inflected as one of the “five nouns” whose final vowel is also their
inflectional vowel.12 The feminine form, dhaat, inflects separately. Both paradigms
are presented here.13
12 See Chapter 7, section 5.4.1.c.
13 There are several variants of this pronoun, but only the most commonly used forms in contempo-
rary Arabic are presented here. See Wright 1967, I:265–66 for greater detail on the Classical Arabic
forms of this pronoun.

yawm-in ‘one day’) (see Chapter 13, section 4.2) or the substantive dhaat used to express “self” or
“same” (e.g., madH-u l-dhaat-i ‘self-praise’) (see Chapter 9, section 5.1.2).

Demonstrative pronouns (√asmaa√al-√ishaara IQÉ°TE’G AÉª°SCG) are determiners used
with nouns or instead of nouns to show either distance from or proximity to the
speaker, like “this” and “that” in English. English has four demonstrative
pronouns: “this,” “that,” “these,” and “those.” Arabic has a richer variety of
demonstratives. In fact, Classical Arabic has a complex system of sets and subsets
of demonstratives,1 but in Modern Standard Arabic, the most commonly used
ones are described as follows.
1 Demonstrative of proximity: ‘this; these’ Gòg haadhaa
The demonstrative pronoun meaning ‘this’ or ‘these’ shows differences in gender
and number, as well as inflection for case in the dual:

and Nahmad 1962, 80-81; Thatcher 1942, 53-55; Blachère and Gaudefroy-Demombynes 1975, 200–203.
Note that the plural demonstrative has no gender distinction and is used only
when referring to human beings. For referring to nonhuman plurals, the femi-
nine singular demonstrative is used.

2 Demonstrative of distance: ‘that; those’ ∂dP dhaalika
The demonstrative of distance “that” and “those” inflects for gender and number
but is rarely used in the dual in MSA. These forms of the demonstrative are invari-
able and do not inflect for case.

3 Functions of demonstratives
The demonstrative pronouns can be used independently, in phrases, or in clauses.
3.1 Independent use
A demonstrative can stand by itself as a noun substitute:
.∂dP ‘ í‚
∂dP ºZQ ≈∏Y
najaH-a fii dhaalika.
ﬁalaa raghm-i dhaalika
He succeeded in that.
despite that

maﬁnaa haadhaa
√a-quul-u haadhaa ﬁan xibrat-in ﬁamaliyyat-in.
the meaning of this
I say this from practical experience.
3.2 Demonstrative phrases
In a demonstrative phrase, the demonstrative pronoun forms a syntactic unit
with a definite noun in order to convey the concept of particular proximity or
distance. These pronouns are considered determiners of nouns (in some ways like
the definite article).
In Arabic, the demonstrative phrase consists of a demonstrative pronoun 
definite article  noun, as follows:
haadhaa  l-  lawn-u
 haadhaa l-lawn-u
¿ƒ∏dG Gòg
‘this-the-color’
 this color

haadhihi  l  ziyaarat-u
 haadhihi l-ziyaarat-u
IQÉjõdG √òg
‘this-the-visit’
 this visit
haa√ulaa√i  l  naas-u
 haa√ulaa√i l-naas-u
¢SÉædG A’Dƒg
‘these  the  people’
 these people
Unlike English, then, the demonstrative phrase includes the definite article
with the noun. If there is a modifying adjective, it follows the noun and agrees
with it in gender, number, case and definiteness.

l-wuzaraa√-i
these officials

3.3 Demonstrative with second term of √iDaafa
The bond between the demonstrative pronoun and its noun is so tight that a
demonstrative phrase is allowed to be used as the second term of an √iDaafa.2
äGQóıG √òg áª«b
äÉ°ShÒØdG  ∂∏J ÒeóJ
qiimat-u haadhihi l-muxaddiraat-i
tadmiir-u tilka l-fiiruusaat-i

3.4 Demonstrative with ﬁrst term of √iDaafa
If a demonstrative is needed for the first term of an √iDaafa, it must follow the
whole √iDaafa. It cannot attach itself to the first term of the √iDaafa because it
must be followed by a noun with the definite article, whereas the first term of
Demonstrative pronouns

an √iDaafa is stripped of the definite article and defined through the second

marHalat-u l-jumuud-i haadhihi

3.5 Demonstrative with possessed noun
A noun made definite by means of a suffixed possessive pronoun cannot be pre-
ceded by a demonstrative pronoun because in order to precede the noun, the
demonstrative must be followed by the definite article. Since a noun with a pos-
sessive pronoun cannot have the definite article (it is definite by virtue of the suf-
fix), the demonstrative follows:
Gòg ¬HÉàc ‘
√òg ¤hC’G »àHôŒ
fii kitaab-i-hi haadhaa
tajribat-ii l-√uulaa haadhihi

fii manshuuraat-i-haa haadhihi
√ahammiyyat-u l-iktishaafaat-i l-Hadiithat-i
in these publications of hers
haadhihi

3.6 Demonstratives with proper names
Proper names are considered definite even though many of them do not have a
definite article. When referring to someone’s name with a demonstrative, it fol-
lows the name:
.Gòg ódÉN ¤EG äô°TCG âæc
kun-tu √ashar-tu √ilaa xaalid-in haadhaa.
I had referred to this ‘Khalid.’
3.7 Demonstrative clauses
In a demonstrative clause, the demonstrative pronoun serves as the subject of the
clause, followed by a complement or predicate. There is therefore a syntactic
boundary between the demonstrative and the rest of the clause.
.»£b Gòg
.qΩÉg ±ÓàNG Gògh
haadhaa qiTT-ii.
wa-haadhaa xtilaaf-un haamm-un.
This [is] my cat.
(‘And’) this [is] an important difference.
.≥FÉ≤◊G ¢†bÉæj …CGQ Gòg
haadhaa ra√y-un yu-naaqiD-u l-Haqaa√iq-a.
This [is] an opinion that contradicts the facts.
318
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

Most often, the predicate of a sentence or clause with a demonstrative as the
subject is indefinite, or a definite noun with a pronoun suffix. 
A noun with a definite article may serve as the predicate of an equational sen-
tence, but if preceded by a demonstrative pronoun, there normally needs to be a
copula or pronoun of separation between the demonstrative and the definite
noun to show that there is a syntactic boundary between them, and that they do
not form a phrase (see below).
3.8 Demonstrative clause with pronoun of separation (copula)
Here the predicate of the equational sentence is a noun with a definite article. In
order to show clearly that there is a separation between a demonstrative pro-
noun subject and the definite noun, a personal pronoun is inserted at the
boundary between subject and predicate to act as a copula or substitute for a
verb of being.
.ÜÉàµdG ƒg Gòg
.ájGóÑdG á£≤f »g ∂∏J
haadhaa huwa l-kitaab-u.

Those are the ideas.
in the party.
3.8.1 Omission of copula
Occasionally, the copula pronoun or pronoun of separation is omitted in the
demonstrative clause, and the separation has to be deduced from the context.
.¢ù«FôdG É¡«a πÑ≤à°ùj »àdG ¤hC’G IôŸG √òg

4.2 Demonstrative dhaat-a äGP
This demonstrative indicates an indefinite distance in time or space and is used as
the first term of an √iDaafa with an indefinite noun:
áKQGh É¡fCG Ωƒj äGP ±ô©J ¿CG πÑb
qabl-a √an ta-ﬁrif-a dhaat-a yawm-in √ann-a-haa waarithat-un

4.3 Use of haa Ég ‘this’
The word haa is sometimes used as a shortened form of haadhaa. It implies an
immediate perception, something like English “behold.”
.ºµàdhO »g Ég
haa hiya dawlat-u-kum.

4.4 Locative demonstrative pronouns: hunaa Éæg, hunaaka ∑Éæg and hunaalika ∂dÉæg
‘here’, ‘there’ and ‘(over) there’
These words are considered both adverbs and locative demonstrative pronouns,
since they denote a place close to, distant from, or very distant from the speaker.

They are used widely in both written and spoken Arabic. Some examples are
found in Chapter 11 on adverbs. Here are some others:

To convey the idea of existence Arabic uses the pronoun/adverb hunaaka ‘there’
paralleling the English use of “there is, there are.” Occasionally the variant hunaa-
lika is also used.

Demonstrative pronouns
321

Relative pronouns relate an element in a subordinate relative clause (in Arabic,
al-Silaá∏°üdG) to a noun or noun phrase in the main clause of a sentence. The Arabic
relative pronoun (al-ism al-mawSuul ∫ƒ°UƒŸGº°S’G) may be definite or indefinite.
MSA uses nine forms of definite relative pronoun. Only the dual form of the defi-
nite relative pronoun shows difference in case. All, however, are marked for num-
ber and gender.
Relative clauses in Arabic are either definite or indefinite; definite clauses are
introduced by a relative pronoun; indefinite relative clauses do not include a
relative pronoun.

As can be seen from the above paradigm the definite relative pronouns have a
component that resembles the definite article, /al-/ /`dG/. They refer only to definite
nouns and noun phrases. The initial /al-/ of the relative pronoun starts with
hamzat al-waSl.

2 Deﬁnite relative clauses
A relative clause referring back to a definite antecedent uses the definite relative
pronouns. The relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in number and gender.

antecedent, but also in case.

3 Indeﬁnite relative clauses
A relative clause may refer to an indefinite noun or noun phrase in the main
clause, in which case the relative pronoun is omitted.
The indefinite relative clause follows the main clause without any relative pro-
noun linking them. They are like two independent sentences implicitly linked
because the second refers back to the first.

4 Resumptive pronouns in relative clauses
When a relative clause in Arabic refers back to a noun or noun phrase in the main
clause which is the object of a verb or a preposition (e.g., “the book that we read,”
“the house that I lived in”), a pronoun must be inserted in the relative clause to
serve as the object of the verb or preposition, referring back to the object noun in
the main phrase [“the book that we read (it),” al-kitaab-u lladhii qara√-naa-hu
√ÉfCGôb …òdG ÜÉàµdG] “the school I studied at (it)” al-madrasat-u llatii daras-tu fii-haa
É¡`«a â°SQO »àdG á°SQóŸG).
This substitute pronoun is called in Arabic the ﬁaa√id óFÉY or raajiﬁ™LGQ
‘returner’ and in English it is referred to as a resumptive pronoun. It occurs in def-
inite and indefinite relative clauses that contain transitive verbs or prepositions
referring back to an object in the main clause.

Indefinite relative clauses do not include relative pronouns, but they must
include a resumptive pronoun if the clause refers back to a noun or noun phrase
that is the object of a preposition or a verb.

5.3 maa and man  resumptive pronoun
The indefinite pronouns maa and man, if they refer to the object of a verb or a
preposition, are usually followed by a resumptive pronoun in the relative clause.2
.§Ñ°†dÉH  √ó°übCG Ée Gòg
.¬``eób Ée ≈∏Y √ôµ°T   
haadhaa maa √aqsid-u-hu bi-l-DabT-i.

He thanked him for what he offered (it).
1 Wehr lists nine different uses of maa (1979, 1042) and Abboud et al. (1997, 47–49) list examples of
all nine uses: negative maa, interrogative maa, relative maa, nominalizing maa, durative maa,
exclamatory maa, indefinite maa, conditional maa, and redundant maa.
2 Technically, a resumptive pronoun is not necessary after an indefinite pronoun that refers to an
object of a verb, but it was used consistently in the data gathered for this book. See Abboud and
McCarus 1983, part 1:588; MECAS 1965, 97.

.¬```LÉà– Ée ≈∏Y π°ü–

So she explained what she meant (it).
5.4 maadhaa as relative pronoun
Sometimes the particle maadhaa ‘what’ is used instead of maa, especially when
the use of maa (which also functions as a negative particle) may be confusing:
.kÉ≤M ójôj GPÉe ±ô©j
ya-ﬁrif-u maadhaa yu-riid-u Haqq-an.
He really knows what he wants.
5.5 Use of maa for approximation
Used with numbers, amounts, and times, maa serves as a pronoun that can link a
prepositional or verbal phrase to a previous statement by indicating approximation:
.áKÓKh øjô¡°T ÚH Ée ¥ô¨à°ùj
ya-staghriq-u maa bayn-a shahr-ayni wa-thalaathat-in.

It is necessary to wait until (approximately what is) after Saturday.
5.6 maa ‘a certain; some, one’
The relative pronoun maa is also used following a noun to emphasize its indefi-
niteness or non-particularity, as in the following expressions:
.Ée óM ¤EG É¡Øbƒe äÒZ
.Ée Éeƒj ™LÒ°S
ghayyar-at mawqif-a-haa √ilaa Hadd-in maa.

The Arabic numeral system has been described as “somewhat complicated”
(Cowan 1964, 182), “assez complexe (‘rather complex’)” (Kouloughli 1994, 121),
“one of the trickiest features of written Arabic” (Haywood and Nahmad 1962, 301),
as having “a special difficulty” (Cantarino 1975, II:361), and it has been said that
the numerals “do not readily lend themselves to inductive analysis” (Ziadeh and
Winder 1957, 148). These observations provide an indication of the complexity of
a system which is important to understand but also challenging in the diversity
of its categories and rules.
Provided here is an outline of the general structure of the morphology and syn-
tax of MSA numerals, with examples taken from various contemporary contexts.1
The rules and examples are presented in numerical order, cardinal numerals first
and then ordinal numerals.2

The numerals “one” and “two” have special features. “One” has two forms: an
adjectival (waaHid) and a noun (or pronoun) form (√aHad), used in different ways.
The numeral “two” is special because of the independent and extensive nature of
the dual category in Arabic morphology. The numerals three to ten, on the other
hand, are all nouns.
1.1 The numeral “one”
1.1.1 waaHid óMGh and waaHida IóMGh
The numeral ‘one’ waaHid has the morphological pattern of an active participle of
Form I (faaﬁil). It behaves syntactically as an adjective, following the counted
noun, and agreeing with it in case and gender.

a noun that forms the first term of an √iDaafa or genitive construct, with the

The genitive and accusative forms of inflection are identical, putting the
numeral “two” into the two-way inflection category, just like the dual suffix on
nouns and adjectives. Note that the initial vowel on ithnaan is a hamzat al-waSl, not
a strong hamza (hamzat al-qaTﬁ).
1.2.1 The dual (al-muthannaa ≈qæãŸG)
The numeral “two” is rarely used for counting purposes because of the existence
of the dual category in the Arabic grammatical system. Two of anything is a sepa-
rate inflectional class and receives a separate inflectional suffix: -aani (nomina-
tive) or -ayni (genitive/accusative). Note that dual agreement (pronouns, verbs,
adjectives) follows a dual noun. See Chapter 7, sections 3.1 and 5.4.2.1., subsection
(1) for further discussion of dual inflection.

1.2.1.6 ‘BOTH’ kilaa AND kiltaa The words kilaa (m.) and kiltaa (f.) are quantifiers
used to express the concept of “both.” These words are related to the noun kull ‘all,’
and are not part of the numeral system, but are considered to have numerative
meaning. They are specifically dual and followed either by a noun in the dual or by
a dual pronoun suffix.
When followed by a noun they do not inflect for case; when followed by a pro-
noun, they do inflect for case.

1.3 Numerals three to ten
Arabic numerals three to ten have two distinctive characteristics: first, they are fol-
lowed by a plural noun in the genitive case, and second, they show gender polar-
ity, or reverse gender agreement with the counted noun. That is, if the singular
noun is masculine, the numeral will have the feminine marker taa√marbuuTa, and
if the singular noun is feminine, the numeral will be in the masculine form.
The numerals three to ten are as follows:

5 The numeral ‘eight’ thamaanin, is defective in the masculine gender (the feminine form, ending in
taa√marbuuTa, is triptote, or regular in declension). As an indefinite defective noun it declines as
follows: nominative and genitive have identical form: thamaan-in; accusative has the form thamaaniy-
an; as a definite noun, the nominative and genitive are also identical: thamaanii, and the accusative
definite form is thamaaniy-a. See the declension for defective nouns in Chapter 7, section 5.4.3

In recitation form, in counting without a counted noun, or in referring to a
specific numeral alone, the form with taa√marbuuTa is usually used. For example:
.q…ôë°S ºbQ ƒg áqà°S ºbQ
!áKÓK ,¿ÉæKEG ,óMGh
raqm-u sittat-in huwa raqm-un siHriyy-un.

1.3.1 Three to ten counted nouns
Counted noun phrases from three to ten have two forms, definite (“the five
houses”) and indefinite (“five houses”). If an adjective follows the counted noun
(“the five large houses; five large houses”), it agrees with the noun in case, gender,
and definiteness. For nonhuman plural nouns, the adjective is feminine singular
and for human nouns, the adjective is plural.
1.3.1.1 INDEFINITE COUNTED NOUN: With an indefinite counted item, the
numeral shows reverse gender agreement and precedes the counted noun. The
case marker on the numeral varies according to its role in the sentence and it
is considered definite because it is in an √iDaafa relationship with the noun, so
the case ending on the numeral is in definite form (i.e., it does not take
nunation). The counted noun itself is plural, indefinite, and in the genitive
case.

1.3.2 Plural numerals

inine plural marker -aat:

1.4 Numerals eleven and twelve
The numerals eleven and twelve start the teens number series.8 In this set of
numerals, the numeral names are compounds, that is, they are formed of two
parts, the first part referring to the first digit and the second part always some
form of the word “ten” (ﬁashar or ﬁashra).
Eleven: The numeral eleven is invariable in case, being accusative at all times.
The first component of the compound number is the word √aHad (m.) óMCG or
√iHdaa (f.) ióMEG, rather than the word waaHid. Both parts of the compound
numeral show the same gender.
Twelve: The numeral twelve shows two case inflections, nominative and geni-
tive-accusative, along the lines of the numeral “two” and the dual. Both parts of
the compound numeral show the same gender.

8 In contemporary newspaper Arabic, numerals over ten tend to be in figures rather than spelled
out in words.  In this chapter the numbers are converted into spelled-out numerals in order to
illustrate how they are pronounced and how the numeral system works.

When used in a counted noun phrase, both components of the compound
numerals eleven and twelve agree with the counted noun in gender. They do
not show gender polarity. They are followed by a noun in the accusative singular.
This accusative is a form of tamyiiz, or “accusative of specification.” 9

1.4.2 Deﬁnite counted nouns with eleven and twelve
When the counted noun is definite, the numeral eleven or twelve follows the
plural noun and the definite article is affixed to the first part of the numeral
only. The case marker of the noun varies depending on the role of the noun in
the sentence; the case marker on eleven is always accusative; the case marker
on the first part of the numeral twelve varies according to the case of the noun it
modifies.

1.5 Numbers thirteen to nineteen
The group of “teens” numerals are similar to the numeral eleven in that they
are invariably in the accusative case and are followed by a singular accusative
noun. They are unlike eleven and twelve in that the first part of the compound
number shows gender polarity with the counted noun, while the second part
of the compound number shows direct gender agreement with the counted
noun.
That is, the first element, three to nine, behaves in gender like the cardinal
numbers three to nine. The second element behaves more like an adjective, agree-
ing with the counted noun in gender.

1.5.2 Deﬁnite counted noun
A definite counted noun with a teens numeral is in the plural, followed by the
teens numeral prefixed with the definite article. The article is on only the first
part of the numeral compound, not the second part. Whereas the counted noun
in this situation may be in any case that its role in the sentence requires, the teens
numeral remains invariably in the accusative case. The first part of the com-
pound number shows gender polarity.

1.5.3 In independent form
When counting or listing the numerals by themselves, the form with the femi-
nine marker on the first element is used, i.e., xamsat-a ﬁashar-a, sittat-a ﬁashar-a,
sabﬁat-a ﬁashar-a ‘fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.’
1.6 Numerals twenty to ninety-nine
The even tens numerals are constructed as a numeral stem joined with a sound
masculine plural suffix that inflects two ways for case, -uuna for the nominative
and -iina for genitive-accusative.11 These even tens numerals themselves do not
show any gender distinctions or differences.
The numbers twenty to ninety-nine are followed by a singular accusative
counted noun, which is a form of tamyiiz, or accusative of specification.

10 Note that the adjective agrees strictly with the counted noun and is singular, although the mean-
ing is plural.
11 In spoken Arabic, the tens numbers are reduced to one case, the genitive-accusative.  However, in
written Arabic, the case distinction is still maintained if the number is written out.
12 The base form for this number appears to be from the lexical root for “ten,” and it has been theo-
rized that originally, it might have been something like *ﬁishr-aani ‘two-tens’ and that the dual suf-
fix came subsequently to resemble the other tens suffixes by a process of analogy.

1.6.3 Compound tens
To construct compound tens numerals, the first part of the compound is an indef-
inite number joined to the second by the conjunction wa- ‘and.’ The first digit
shows case and gender as follows:
1.6.3.1 THE “ONES” AND “TWOS” The units twenty-one, thirty-one and so forth are
constructed with the numeral “one” and then the tens component. The numeral
“one” shows straight gender agreement with the noun. It can be either of the form
waaHid/ waaHida or the form √aHad/√iHdaa.
The “twos” units inflect for case as duals and show straight gender agreement
with the counted noun.

1.6.3.2 TENS NUMERALS PLUS THREES TO NINES: Numerals such as twenty-four,
seventy-six, thirty-five and so on are compounded of the single digit number
linked to the tens numeral by means of the conjunction wa-, making combinations
such as “four and twenty, six and seventy, five and thirty,” and so forth. Except for
the numeral eight, which belongs to the defective declension, the single digits are
triptote, they take nunation, and they show reverse gender with the counted
noun. The counted noun is singular, indefinite, and accusative. Both parts of the
numeral inflect for case.

1.7 The even hundreds
The word for “hundred” in Arabic is mi√a, spelled both as áÄe and áFÉe. It is a fem-
inine noun and remains feminine at all times. When used with a counted noun,
it goes into an √iDaafa relationship with the noun and that noun is in the genitive
singular. The concept of “two hundred” is expressed by using mi√a in the dual,
with the dual suffix. The dual suffix here obeys the law of nuun-drop when it goes
into an √iDaafa with a following counted noun:

1.9.1 Counting in thousands
When used for counting, the numeral √alf / √aalaaf goes into an √iDaafa relationship
with the following noun, which is in the genitive singular. In complex numerals
over a thousand (as with mi√a), it is the final component of the numeral that
determines the number (singular or plural) and case of the counted noun.

1.9.2 Special cases
For the even thousands plus “one” or “two,” a special construction exists in Clas-
sical Arabic, although no instances of it were encountered in the data covered for
this project.

1.10 Reading years in dates
Because Arabic has two words for ‘year,’ ﬁaam ΩÉY / √aﬁwaam ΩGƒYCG (masculine) and
sana áæ°S / sanawaat äGƒæ°S (feminine), the numbers in year dates can vary in gen-
der. When reading year dates, the word for ‘year’ (either ﬁaam or sana) precedes
the numeral expression and is in an √iDaafa with it, so that the date itself is the
second term of the √iDaafa and is in the genitive case.
Because of the reverse gender rule, if the masculine noun ﬁaam is used, then
any 3–10 digit is feminine, and if the feminine noun sana is used, then any 3–10
digit is in the masculine.
In general, either the phrase ‘in the year’ fii ﬁaam-i or fii sanat-i is used, or the
word ﬁaam-a or sanat-a is used in the accusative ( time adverbial). Sometimes these
phrases are understood and not explicitly mentioned.

1.11 Millions and billions
Arabic has borrowed the terms “million” (milyuun¿ƒ«∏e /malaayiinÚjÓe) and “bil-
lion” (bilyuun ¿ƒ«∏H /balaayiin ÚjÓH), using them in much the same way as the
terms for hundred and thousand. The names of the numerals themselves are mas-
culine and when counting, they form the first term of an √iDaafa with the follow-
ing noun, which is genitive singular.

2 Ordinal numerals
Ordinal numerals are essentially adjectives. They usually follow the noun that
they modify and agree with it in gender, but sometimes they precede the noun as
the first term of an √iDaafa structure. Occasionally they may also be used as inde-
pendent substantives (i.e., “the fifth of May”; “twenty seconds”).
2.1 ‘First:’ √awwal ∫qhCG and √uulaa ¤hCG
The Arabic words for “first” are √awwal (m.) and √uulaa (f.). They can either follow
the noun they modify or precede it as first term of an √iDaafa. 
2.1.1 √awwal
The word √awwal (plural √awaa√il) may function as the first term of an √iDaafa
structure, as an adjective following a noun, or as an independent noun.

14 The masculine form of the word for ‘second’ thaanin (pl. thawaanin) is a defective adjective and
inflects for case and definiteness in declension six.  See Chapter 7, section 5.4.3.
15 The adjective saadis ‘sixth’ has a related but different lexical root (s-d-s) from the root for “six” ( s-t-t ).

2.2.1 Ordinal numeral as ﬁrst term of √iDaafa
Occasionally, an ordinal numeral will precede the noun it modifies, as the first
term of an √iDaafa structure. In this case it is usually the masculine form of the
number that is used, even if the following noun is feminine:

2.2.2 Ordinals as nouns: thaanin/thaanii
The ordinal “second” may be used as a substantive. In its masculine singular form,
as a final-weak noun, it is in the defective declension.

what the case of the noun they are modifying. The definite article goes on the

2.4 Twentieth to ninety-ninth
The ordinals for the group of numerals from twenty to ninety-nine are of two
types: straight tens (“twentieth, fortieth, eightieth”) and compound tens (“twenty-
first, forty-fifth, fifty-third”). In both cases the tens component does not vary from
its numeral shape. That is, twentieth (ﬁishruuna ¿hô°ûY) and twenty (ﬁishruuna)
look the same. However, as an adjective, ﬁishruuna may take a definite article, and
it agrees in case with the noun it modifies. It remains invariable in gender.

of the tens ordinal agree in case and definiteness with the modified noun. Note
that the word Haad-in mOÉM (def. Haadii …OÉM) is used to indicate ‘first’ in tens

3.1.2 Special functions of niSf ∞°üf :
The term niSf may also function as the equivalent of “semi-” or “hemi-”:

q‹Éª°ûdG IôµdG ∞°üf
fii l-ijtimaaﬁ-i niSf-i l-sanawiyy-i

Hattaa l-ﬁaashirat-i wa-l-niSf-i SabaaH-an

3.2 Telling time
The ordinal numbers are used for telling time in MSA. The word “hour” (saaﬁa
áYÉ°S) may or may not be mentioned, but the ordinal numeral is in the feminine
form, agreeing with that noun. 
áæeÉãdG áYÉ°ùdG ‘

Rather than expressions such as “seven-fifteen” or “seven-twenty” or “seven-
thirty,” Arabic usually uses fractions of the hour: rubﬁ, thulth, and niSf:

case.  The following noun may be definite or indefinite.
17 For further examples of telling time, see Abboud and McCarus 1985, Part 1:301-303 and Schultz et
al. 2000, 212–13.
18 The word for “Friday” is from the root j-m-ﬁ‘to gather together.’ 
19 The root for “Saturday” is cognate with the word “Sabbath.”

When used in syntax, the names of the days may occur independently, with the
definite article, or as the second term of an √iDaafa with the word yawm ‘day,’ or
they may be in apposition with a time word, such as “yesterday,” “tomorrow,” or
“today.”

4 Expressions of serial order: “last”
We have already seen the use of expressions for “first” and other numerical rank-
ings. The concept of “last” or “final” is expressed by the terms √aaxir or √axiir. They
are both from the same lexical root but are different in form and distribution.
4.1 √aaxir ôNBG ‘last, ﬁnal’
The noun √aaxir is an active participle in form, signifying the final part or the end
part of something. Its plural is √awaaxir ôNGhCG if it refers to nonhuman entities,
and √aaxir-uuna ¿hôNBG (m. pl.) or √aaxir-aat äGôNBG (f. pl.) if it refers to humans. It is
often used as the first term of an √iDaafa.

1 Overview
In Arabic as in English, prepositions refer to a location (e.g., ‘at, in’ fii ‘, bi- Ü) or
a direction (e.g., ‘to, from’ ¤EG √ilaa, min øe), and the meanings of prepositions can
apply to concepts of space (‘at school’ fii l-madrasat-i á°SQóŸG ‘) or time (‘at five
o’clock’ fii l-saaﬁat-i l-xaamisat-i á°ùeÉÿG áYÉ°ùdG ‘).
Prepositions may also be used in abstract or figurative ways (‘at least’ ﬁalaa
l-ﬁaqall-i πbC’G ≈∏Y; ‘by the way’ ﬁalaa fikrat-in Iôµa ≈∏Y). They may occur in conjunc-
tion with verbs to convey a particular meaning (e.g., raHHab-a bi- Ö ÖqMQ ‘to wel-
come’ or ﬁabbar-a ﬁan øY ôqÑY ‘to express’). Arabic has a number of these verb-prepo-
sition idioms, where the preposition used with the verb is essential for expressing
a specific meaning.
1.1 Arabic preposition types
Arabic prepositional expressions fall into two groups, the first group being a rela-
tively small number (ten) of “true” prepositions, and the other group being a
more extensive collection of locative expressions. 
1.2 Huruuf al-jarr qô÷G  ±hôM
According to Arabic grammatical theory, the non-derived prepositions are the
true, fundamental markers of location and direction, and are called Huruuf
al-jarr qô÷G ±hôM, ‘particles of attraction’ because they “attract” a substantive
(noun or adjective) in the genitive case or a suffix pronoun. These non-derived
prepositions are a limited and invariable set of lexical items. 
1.3 Zuruuf makaan wa-Zuruuf zamaan ¿ÉeR  ±hôXh  ¿Éµe  ±hôX
The derived prepositions, on the other hand, usually come from triliteral lex-
ical roots that are also the source of verbs, nouns, and other parts of speech.
They are called locative adverbs, or in Arabic Zuruuf makaan wa-Zuruuf zamaan
¿ÉeR ±hôXh  ¿Éµe ±hôX ‘adverbs of place and adverbs of time.’ These words
denote location in much the same way as prepositions and in this work they are

referred to as semi-prepositions.1 These semi-prepositions may take different case
inflections or, in some cases, nunation.
Each of the two preposition types has particular attributes, but the basic rule
that applies to both classes is that the noun, noun phrase, or adjective object of
the preposition is in the genitive case.2 If the object of the preposition or semi-
preposition is a personal pronoun, it takes the form of a pronoun suffix.3
Prepositions and semi-prepositions are crucial elements in Arabic syntax, play-
ing fundamental syntactic and semantic roles. However, their usage can be highly
idiomatic and may not necessarily correspond to their English equivalents. There-
fore, a wide selection of examples is included here.
2 True prepositions (Huruuf al-jarr qô÷G ±hôM)
This small set of lexical items contains the true Arabic prepositions, words that
exist strictly as prepositions. There are only ten of them in Modern Standard Ara-
bic, but they are of great frequency and they each have a wide range of meanings.
They are: bi- li-, ka-, fii, min, ﬁan, √ilaa, ﬁalaa, Hattaa and mundhu. One of the dis-
tinctive features of this word class is that a true Arabic preposition (Harf al-jarr
qô÷G ±ôM) cannot be preceded by another preposition.
Another characteristic is that only this class of prepositions can combine with
verbs to create verb-preposition idioms (such as baHath-a fii ‘discuss’ and baHath-a
ﬁan ‘search for’).
This set of items can be divided on the basis of orthography into one-letter, two-
letter, and three-letter word groups. Examples are provided to illustrate both spa-
tiotemporal and abstract uses. In certain cases, frequent idiomatic uses are noted
as well.
2.1 One-letter prepositions: bi- `H; li- `d; and ka- c
The three members of this group consist of one consonant plus a short vowel.
This means that they do not exist as independent orthographical items and they
need to be prefixed to the noun that follows.
2.1.1 The preposition bi- ‘at, with, in, by; by means of’
The preposition bi- designates contiguity in its broadest sense. It has a wide range
of uses including spatiotemporal, instrumental, and manner adverbial.
1 In his excellent short reference work Grammaire de l’arabe d’aujourd’ hui, D. E. Kouloughli refers to
this group of words as “quasi-prépositions” (1994, 152), which is also an appropriate label. Abboud
et al. 1997, 67–68 refer to these words as “noun-prepositions.”
2 For an in-depth semantic and syntactic analysis of Arabic prepositions see Ryding-Lentzner 1977.
3 When the object of the preposition is an invariable or non-inflected word, such as certain demon-
strative pronouns or adverbs (e.g., dhaalika ‘that’ or hunaa ‘here’), it remains invariable, e.g, min
hunaa ‘from here,’ or baﬁd-a dhaalika ‘after that.’

2.1.1.2 INSTRUMENTAL bi- (baa√al-√aala ádB’G AÉH; baa√al-istiﬁaana áfÉ©à°S’G AÉH): The
preposition bi- is used to refer to an instrument (tool, material, body part) with
which an action is accomplished. The instrument can be defined as “an object
that plays a role in bringing a process about, but which is not the motivating
force, the cause or the instigator” (Chafe 1970, 152).

2.1.1.4 MANNER ADVERBIAL: The preposition bi- can be used with a noun to
modify a verb phrase by describing the manner in which an action took place.

370
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
When used in this way, the bi- phrase answers the question “how?” and the object
of the preposition is usually an abstract noun.4

When indicating manner, bi- is sometimes prefixed to a noun such as Suura
‘manner,’ Tariiqa ‘way,’ or shakl ‘form’ followed by a modifier that provides the
exact description of the manner:

2.1.1.5 bi- AS PREFIX FOR THE PREDICATE OF A NEGATIVE COPULA (al-xabar al-manﬁyy
»ØæŸG ÈÿG): A negative verb of being such as lays-a ‘is not’ or lam ya-kun ‘was not’
may be followed by bi- as part of the predicate. This is especially the case when the
predicate involves the use of a demonstrative pronoun:
.áq«qªgC’G √ò¡H øµj ⁄ É¡æe kGóMCG qøµd
laakinna √aHad-an min-haa lam ya-kun bi-haadhihi l-√ahammiyyat-i.

Prepositions and prepositional phrases
371
2.1.2 The preposition li- ‘to; belonging to; for; for the purpose of’
The preposition li- is used to express purpose, direction toward (destination), pos-
session, the indirect object or dative concept of ‘to,’ and the benefactive concept
of ‘for’ or ‘on behalf of.’
There are two spelling rules to observe with li-.
(1)
When attached to a noun with the definite article, the √alif of the definite
article is deleted and the laam of li- attaches directly to the laam of the defi-
nite article (e.g., li-l-jaamiﬁat-i á©eÉé∏d).
(2)
When li- is followed by a pronoun suffix, it changes its short vowel to fatHa
and becomes la- (la-ka ∂nd, la-ki ∂nd, la-hu ¬nd, la-haa É¡nd, la-kumaa Éªµnd, la-humaa
Éª¡nd, la-naa Éænd, la-kum ºµnd, la-kunna qøµnd, la-hum º¡nd, la-hunna qø¡nd) except with
the first person singular pronoun suffix, -ii, which is suffixed directly to the
laam (l-ii ‹ ‘to me, for me’).
2.1.2.1 PURPOSE, CAUSE, REASON, OR MOTIVATION: ‘IN ORDER TO, FOR THE
PURPOSE OF; DUE TO, BECAUSE OF’ (laam al-taﬁliil π«∏©àdG Ω’): This use of li- includes
expression of the intention for doing something as well as the reason or
motivation for something. “The distinction between intention and reason is made
because in English the two are expressed in different terms: the former is
introduced by a phrase such as ‘in order to’ or ‘for’ whereas the latter is
introduced by a phrase such as ‘because of.’ In Arabic these are both considered to
be under the category of taﬁliil” (Ryding-Lentzner 1977, 132).

2.1.2.2 POSSESSION (laam al-milk ∂∏ŸG Ω’): MSA does not normally use a verb
equivalent to ‘have.’5 The preposition li- is usually used instead to predicate the
concept of belonging in both concrete and abstract senses.6 If the predication

√a-mlik-u HiSaan-an raa√iﬁ-an ‘I own/possess a splendid horse.’
6 Possession is also expressed by the semi-prepositions ladaa and ﬁind-a (q.v.), although ﬁind-a is
chiefly used in spoken Arabic.

poral, whilst li- generally indicates abstract or ideal relations . . . Its principal use is to show the
passing on of the action to a more distant object and hence it corresponds to the Latin or German
dative.”

2.1.3 The preposition ka- n`c ‘like, as; such as; in the capacity of’
This preposition is used for comparison and expresses similarity. It also desig-
nates capacity or function. It is restricted in occurrence because it is not used with
personal (suffix) pronouns; however it can be used with demonstrative pronouns
(e.g., ka-dhaalika ∂dòc ‘like that, thus; likewise.’).

2.2 Two-letter prepositions
Prepositions that consist of two letters include: fii, min and ﬁan.
2.2.1 ﬁi ‘ ‘in; at; on’
The preposition fii is an essential locative preposition in Arabic. It can be used to
express location in space (fii l-jaamiﬁat-i á©eÉ÷G ‘ ‘at the university’) or in time (fii
l-SabaaH-i ìÉÑ°üdG ‘ ‘in the morning’), as well as figuratively. It may translate as
‘at,’ ‘in,’ or ‘on,’ depending on the context.

2.2.1.6 SPECIAL FORMS OF PRONOUN SUFFIXES: Because of its long vowel ending,
fii has special forms for the pronoun suffixes -ii ‘me,’ -hu ‘him,’ -humaa ‘them
[two],’ -hum, and -hunna ‘them.’ The -ii suffix merges with the -ii of fii and changes
to -iyya; the vowel-shift suffixes, because they come after an -ii sound, change their
-u vowel to -i.8

8 The vowel-shift suffixes are the personal pronoun suffixes of the third person that normally have
Damma after haa√:-hu, -humaa, -hum, and -hunna. This Damma shifts to kasra when preceded by a
front vowel or fronted semivowel (-i- or -ii- or sometimes yaa√). See also chapter 12, 2.1.1.

2.2.2 The preposition min øe ‘of; from; than’
The preposition min indicates direction away from, or point of departure when used
spatiotemporally. In addition, it is used to denote source, material, or quantity. It
also is used in expressions of comparison, with a comparative adjective where Eng-
lish would use the word “than.” It can be used in figurative or abstract ways as well
as concrete spatiotemporal ways. Because it ends with a sukuun, it sometimes needs
a helping vowel. That vowel is /-a/ before the definite article and otherwise, /-i/.
2.2.2.1 min AS ‘FROM’: Used as a directional preposition, min indicates ‘from’:

2.2.2.6 THE USE OF min WITH LOCATIVE ADVERBS: When min occurs before a

the adverb to kasra if the adverb is followed by a noun or pronoun suffix.

may be used with a descriptive term such as a participle or adjective expressing an
introductory observation, just as in English some sentences start with “It is.” This
is a way to avoid mentioning the source of a judgment or evaluation and is
especially common usage in media Arabic, where observations may need to be
general or unattributed.

2.2.2.8 WITH qariib Öjôb ‘NEAR’: An idiomatic use of min occurs with the adjective
qariib ‘near, close.’ English speakers think of “close to” or “near to” when using
this adjective, but the correct Arabic preposition to use is min.

2.2.2.9 SOME SPELLING VARIATIONS: When suffixed with the pronoun -ii ‘me,’ the
nuun in min doubles, so that instead of *min-ii, the phrase ‘from me’ or ‘than me’
becomes minnii »qæe.
When followed by the pronouns maa ‘what, that, whatever,’ or man ‘whoever,’
the nuun of min is assimilated to the miim of maa, or man√ and doubles, yielding the
contractions mimmaa Éq‡ ‘of/from that, from what’ and mimman øq‡ ‘of/from
whom.’

2.2.3 The preposition ﬁan ‘from, away from; about’
Arabic grammars consider ﬁan to be a true preposition, but its syntactic behavior
under certain conditions also allows it to be classified as a noun.10 Its original
meaning, according to Wright (1967, 2:143), was as a noun meaning ‘side.’11
10 E.g., when it serves as the object of the preposition min (see below).
11 Its nominal use survives in the expressions such as min ﬁan yamiin-i-ka ‘from your right [side].’ For
discussion of this point see Ryding Lentzner 1977, 94.

Prepositions and prepositional phrases
381
This preposition has two distinct meanings, one having to do with ‘distance away
from,’ and the other with the concept of ‘concerning’ or ‘about.’ As other preposi-
tions, it can have spatiotemporal and abstract uses, as well as idiomatic ones.
In terms of special spelling rules, the helping vowel used with ﬁan is /-i/. When
suffixed to a pronoun starting with miim (maa, man) the nuun of ﬁan is assimilated
to the miim, and doubles: ﬁammaa ÉqªY, ﬁamman øqªY. Likewise, when suffixed with
the first person singular personal pronoun -ii, the nuun doubles: ﬁannii »qænY.

2.3 Three-letter prepositions: ﬁalaa ≈∏Y, √ilaa ¤EG, and Hattaa ≈qàM
All three of these prepositions end with √alif maqSuura. A particular spelling fea-
ture of both ﬁalaa and ﬁilaa is that the final √alif maqSuura converts to yaa√when a
pronoun suffix is added to the word. Owing to the shift of the √alif to yaa√, the
third person pronoun suffixes -hu, -humaa, -hum, and -hunna shift their vowel from
/-u/ to/ -i/ and become -hi, -himaa, -him, and -hinna. For a model inflectional chart of
ﬁalay- and √ilay- plus pronoun suffixes see Chapter 12 section 2.3.
Note that Hattaa does not take pronoun suffixes.

2.3.1 The preposition ﬁalaa ≈∏Y ‘on, upon’
This preposition designates the concept of ‘on’ or ‘upon’ in general, whether spa-
tio-temporal or figurative. In the abstract sense, it conveys also a sense of “incum-
bent upon.”

Spatial meaning:

(2)
Temporal meaning: Used with a word denoting extent of time, ﬁalaa has a
durative sense and may indicate passage of time from a particular point in
the past. This can be expressed in English in various ways.

Úeƒj  ióe ≈∏Y

2.3.1.2 FIGURATIVE MEANING: Used figuratively, ﬁalaa can denote a range of
meanings, some a direct reflection of the spatiotemporal concepts; others more
abstract. Among those abstract meanings are the sense of ‘according to; as for’
and ‘incumbent upon.’
q…ô°üæY ÒZ ¢SÉ°SCG ≈∏Y

(1)
‘up to; incumbent upon; must; have to’: Used in this sense, ﬁalaa denotes a
required or expected action. It is therefore followed either by the particle
√an plus a subjunctive verb, or by a verbal noun.

2.3.2 The preposition √ilaa ¤EG ‘to, towards’
The general meaning of √ilaa is directional towards an object. It is used spa-
tiotemporally and also in abstract and figurative ways. When used in abstract
senses it often has the sense of ‘addition to.’
Because its final letter is √alif maqSuura, like ﬁalaa, its √alif converts to yaa√when
pronoun suffixes are added (see Chapter 12, section 2.3).

2.3.3 The preposition Hattaa ≈qàM ‘until, up to’
Hattaa, although it ends with √alif maqSuura like √ilaa and ﬁalaa, does not take per-
sonal pronoun objects (suffix pronouns) and therefore it does not change its
shape or spelling. Its meaning as a preposition is closely related to that of √ilaa ‘to,
towards’ except that it designates direction in time rather than in space.
It is important to note that Hattaa has at least two other functions in Arabic syn-
tax other than as a preposition meaning ‘up to’ or ‘until’; it also is an adverb or
preposition with the meaning of ‘even’ and a conjunctive particle used with verbs
meaning ‘in order to.’

2.3.4 The preposition mundhu oòæe ‘since; ago; for’
This preposition has the meaning of distance or extent in time and can be trans-
lated in several ways, depending on context. Like Hattaa and ka- it does not take
personal pronoun objects.
2.3.4.1 mundhu AS ‘FOR; IN’: Used to mean ‘for’ or ‘in,’ it denotes a time span
during which something goes on. Its object is usually a noun phrase that refers to
a span of time:

2.3.4.2 mundhu AS ‘SINCE; FROM’: When mundhu means ‘since,’ it specifies a
particular point of time in the past where the action began. It can also mean
‘from’ when the beginning of a time period is denoted and an end specified (often
used with Hattaa ‘until, up to’).

from the present time:

2.3.4.4 PRESENT PERFECT MEANING WITH mundhu: An action started in the past
and continuing into the present is usually rendered by the present tense in
Arabic, whereas in English, the present perfect is used. The preposition mundhu is
used to specify at which point in the past the action started. This structure may
occur with verbal predications or with equational predications.

3 Locative adverbs or semi-prepositions (Zuruuf makaan wa-Zuruuf 
zamaan ¿ÉeR ±hôXh ¿Éµe ±hôX)
These words function in many ways as prepositions but are not “true” preposi-
tions because
(1)
they are derived from triliteral lexical roots and 
(2)
they can be preceded by a true preposition or even another semi-
preposition.
Usually they show accusative case marking with fatHa, to indicate their adver-
bial function. Under certain circumstances, that case marker can change.12 Like
true prepositions, they are normally followed by a noun in the genitive case or a
pronoun suffix.
Semi-prepositions or locative adverbs are used in concrete and figurative ways,
but they do not have the extensive range of abstract meanings that true preposi-
tions have, nor are they normally used in verb-preposition idioms. Included here
are examples of some of the most common ones.
3.1 √amaam-a ΩÉeCG ‘in front of; facing; in the face of; before; to’
The word √amaam-a refers to a position ‘in front’ or ‘before,’ both spatially and
figuratively:
12 The fact that the case marker may change is considered an indicator of their close relationship to
nouns.

3.3.1 Repetition of bayn-a with pronoun

If both of the objects of the preposition are nouns, bayn-a is used only once and
the second noun is conjoined to the first with the conjunction wa- ‘and.’ Both
nouns are considered objects of the semi-preposition and both are in the genitive
case. A dual noun or a plural noun may also follow bayn-a.

object. In some cases it might be preceded by a true preposition (usually min or
√ilaa), and its case marker then changes to genitive (final kasra). It still is followed
by a noun or pronoun in the genitive case.

The locative use of baﬁd-a includes both time and place.

3.4.3 baﬁd-u oó©H
If there is no noun or pronoun following baﬁd, it is considered an adverb. In this
case, devoid of a noun or pronoun object, baﬁd changes its final vowel to Damma.13
In this adverbial role, the final Damma is invariable. The expression baﬁd-u is used
chiefly as an adverbial of time in negative clauses, meaning ‘[not] yet.’
.ó©H  √óYƒe Oqóëj ⁄
lam yu-Haddad mawﬁid-u-hu baﬁd-u.

13 The final Damma on baﬁd-u and on certain other semi-prepositions (qabl-u, taHt-u) is considered to
be a remnant of an old locative case. This Damma has two characteristics: (1) it is invariable, even
after a preposition (e.g., min qabl-u; min taHt-u); (2) it cannot be on the first term of an √iDaafa, that
is, it cannot be followed by a noun in the genitive case or by a pronoun suffix. See Chapter 11,
section 4.1.3, especially note 12.

3.18 maﬁ-a n™ne ‘with’14
The basic meaning of maﬁ-a has to do with accompaniment or association and is
almost always equivalent to English ‘with.’ Note that it is not used for indicating
instrumental concepts; bi- is used for that. It is also possible to use maﬁ-a to express
possession of something concrete that people could “have with” them, such as a
wallet or keys. This expression of possession does not indicate permanency or the
concept of ‘belonging to.’

14 The word maﬁ-a may seem like a true preposition because it is a lexical primitive and is sometimes
used in verb-preposition expressions (naaqash-a maﬁ-a ‘to discuss with,’ tasaawaa maﬁ-a ‘to equate
with,’ taﬁaawan-a maﬁ-a ‘to cooperate with,’ ijtamaﬁ-a maﬁ-a ‘to meet with’). The eighth-century
Arabic grammarian Sibawayhi, however, cites the phrase dhahab-a min maﬁ-i-hi ‘he left him,’
showing that maﬁ-a can sometimes be the object of another preposition. Sibawayhi 1970, I:177.

3.34 ﬁind-a nóæY ‘on the part of’; ‘in the opinion of’; ‘near, by, at, upon’; ‘chez’
The semi-preposition ﬁind-a denotes location in space or time. It can also denote
temporary location at the “place” where someone lives or works (e.g., huwa ﬁind-a
l-Tabiib-i ‘He’s at the doctor’s’).
In spoken Arabic, ﬁind-a plays a fundamental role in the expression of posses-
sion, and some of that possession role has crept into MSA, especially in the
relating of conversations or interviews where people are quoted directly. The
more usual preposition to use for possession in formal MSA is li-, or the semi-
preposition ladaa.

4 Prepositions with clause objects
Prepositions may take entire clauses as their objects, in which case they may be
followed by the subordinating conjunctions √an or √anna. For more on subordi-
nate clauses, see Chapter 19. Here are two examples:

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

Question formation and the use of question words in Arabic are not complex. In
general, the interrogative word is placed at the beginning of a sentence. There is
no inversion of word order, usually just the insertion of the question word.
The most common question words in Arabic include:
√ayn-a
‘where’
nørjnCG
√ayy
‘which; what’
q…nCG
kam
‘how much; how many’
rºnc
kayf-a
‘how’
n∞r«nc
li-maadhaa
‘why’
GPÉªpd
maa
‘what’
Ée
maadhaa
‘what’
GPÉe
man
‘who/whom’
røne
mataa
‘when’
≈àne
hal
introduces yes/no question
rπng
√a-

nCG
1 √ayn-a nørjnCG ‘where’
The question word √ayn-a is invariable, even after a preposition. It always ends
with fatHa.1

Questions and question words
1 Note that the question word √ayna is not used as the locative adverb ‘where.’ To express an idea
such as “at a university where he teaches,” the adverb Hayth-u is used for ‘where’: fii jaamiﬁat-in
Hayth-u yu-darris-u. See Chapter 11, section 3.1.3 for more on Hayth-u.

1.1 √ayn-a-maa ÉªnærjnCG ‘wherever’
With the addition of the function word maa, interrogative √ayna becomes a con-
ditional particle with the meaning of ‘wherever.’
âæc  ÉªæjCG
√ayn-a-maa kunt-a

2 √ayy-un w…nCG ‘which; what’
As a question word, √ayy- can be an indefinite noun, meaning ‘which one?’ or as
the first part of a construct phrase, it specifies ‘which  noun.’ It may alterna-
tively be followed by a pronoun suffix (e.g., ?º¡qjCG √ayy-u-hum? ‘which of them?’). It
takes the full set of three case endings, depending on its function and placement
in the sentence.2
?ÖgòJ mádhO  u…C’
?pør«ëq°TôŸG øe w…CG

Which one of the (two) candidates?
?mÖfQCG  t…CG
√ayy-u √arnab-in?
Which rabbit?/What rabbit?
3 kam rºnc ‘how much; how many’
This question word is usually followed by a singular indefinite noun in the accu-
sative case.3
?¬æ«aô©J ∑Éª°SC’G øe kÉYƒf  ºc
?ºà∏ªcCG  kÉ°SQO  ºc
kam nawﬁ-an min-a l-√asmaak-i ta-ﬁrif-iina-hu?
kam dars-an √akmal-tum?
How many kinds of fish do you (f.) know?
How many lessons have you 
(m. pl.) completed?
3.1 kam rºnc  nominative
When the interrogative word kam has the meaning of ‘how much [is],’ it is fol-
lowed by a definite noun (either with the definite article or with a pronoun
suffix) in the nominative case:4
402
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
2 The word √ayy- also has a non-interrogative use as a determiner meaning ‘any.’ For more on this
see Chapter 9, section 5.2.
3 The accusative case after kam is considered to be a form of tamyiiz, or accusative of specification.
For more on tamyiiz, see Chapter 7, section 5.3.3.7 and Chapter 11, section 6.
4 In this use of kam, it is actually a fronted predicate of an equational sentence; the noun is in the
nominative as the subject/topic of an equational sentence.

?oáYÉ°ùdG  ºc
?√oôªY  ºc
kam-i l-saaﬁat-u?
kam ﬁumr-u-hu?
What time is it? (‘How much is the hour?’)
How old is he? (‘How much is his
age?’)
4 kayf-a n∞r«nc ‘how’
The interrogative word kayf-a is invariable in case. It always ends with fatHa. It may
be followed by a verb or by a noun.
?o∫É◊G n∞«c
?Éæg ¤EG â∏°Uh  n∞«c
kayf-a l-Haal-u?
kayf-a waSal-ta √ilaa hunaa?
How are you? (‘How is the condition?’)

?o∑qôëàJ n∞«c
kayf-a ﬁaraf-ti?
kayf-a ta-taHarrak-u?
How did you (f.) know?
How does it move?
5 li-maadhaa GPÉªpd ‘why; what for’
This is a compound word consisting of the preposition li- ‘for’ and the question
word maadhaa ‘what.’ Thus its meaning of ‘what for’ or ‘why.’
?áMÉÑ°ùdG qÖ– GPÉŸ
?π«ãªàdG ¤EG  â¡éqJG GPÉŸ
li-maadhaa tu-Hibb-u l-sibaaHat-a?

So why don’t you leave matters as they (‘naturally’) are?
6 maa Ée and maadhaa GPÉe ‘what’
The interrogatives maa and maadhaa have similar meanings but are used in differ-
ent contexts. In general, maa is used in questions involving equational (verbless)
sentences and maadhaa is used with verbs.5
6.1 maa ‘what’
Interrogative maa is used with verbless predications.
?∂ª°SG Ée
?∂jCGQ Ée
maa sm-u-ka?
maa ra√y-u-ki?

403
5 Interrogative maa is probably not used with verbs because it is a homonym with negative maa,
which when used with a verb indicates negation (e.g., maa √adrii ‘I don’t know.’).

?¥ôØdG Ée
?ÖÑ°ùdG Ée
maa l-farq-u?
maa l-sabab-u?
What [is] the difference?
What [is] the reason?
When used to ask a question with a longer noun phrase, maa may be followed
directly by an independent third person personal pronoun acting as a copula in
the question:
?¤h’G áqª¡ŸG »g Ée
maa hiya l-mahammat-u l-√uulaa?
What is the first task (‘What is it, the first task’)?
?çqƒ∏àdG πcÉ°ûe qºgCG »g Ée
maa hiya √ahamm-u mashaakil-i l-talawwuth-i?
What are the most important problems of pollution?

6.2 maadhaa GPÉe ‘what’
The question word maadhaa is used mainly with verbs:
?iôL GPÉe
?∂∏gCG π©Øj GPÉe
maadhaa jaraa?
maadhaa ya-fﬁal-u √ahl-u-ka?

maadhaa ta-ﬁtaqid-u?
maadhaa ta-√kul-u?

Sometimes maadhaa is used like a relative pronoun meaning ‘that which,’ or ‘what’:
.∫ƒ≤J GPÉe º¡aCG ’
laa √a-fham-u maadhaa ta-quul-u.
I don’t understand what you are saying.
6.2.3 maadhaa ﬁan ‘what about’

topic.
?øjôNB’G IOÉ≤dG øY GPÉe
maadhaa ﬁan-i l-qaadat-i l-√aaxar-iina?

mataa is used only as an interrogative, not as a connective adverb meaning
‘when.’6

9 hal and √a- -CG ﬁinterrogative markers
Both hal and √a- are prefixed to statements in order to convert them into yes/no
questions. They have equivalent functional meaning, but different distribution:
hal is used with a wide range of constructions; √a- is restricted in that it is not used
before a noun with the definite article or words that start with √alif plus hamza,
such as √anta ‘you.’ Neither word is translatable into English, since shift in word
order is the signal of yes/no question formation in English.

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

Connectives – words or phrases that connect one part of discourse with another –
are a pervasive feature of MSA syntax.1 Arabic sentences and clauses within a text
are connected and interconnected by means of words or phrases (such as wa- ‘and’ )
that coordinate, subordinate, and otherwise link them semantically and syntacti-
cally. This frequent use of connectives results in a high degree of textual cohesion
in Arabic writing that contrasts significantly with the terser style of written
English. Not only are parts of Arabic sentences coordinated or subordinated
in various ways, but most sentences within a text actually start with a connective
word that links each sentence with the previous ones.
Even paragraphs are introduced with connectives that connect them to the text
as a whole. As Al-Batal remarks: “MSA seems to have a connecting constraint that
requires the writer to signal continuously to the reader, through the use of
connectives, the type of link that exists between different parts of the text. This
gives the connectives special importance as text-building elements and renders
them essential for the reader’s processing of text” (1990, 256).
Connective words that link sentences within a text are referred to as “discourse
markers.” 2 Analysis of discourse markers in English has tended to focus on spoken
conversation whereas analysis of discourse markers in Arabic (Al-Batal 1990,
Johnstone 1990, Kammensjö 1993) has focused particularly on the structure of
written narrative. Arabic writing has been characterized as syndetic, that is, as
using conjunctions to link discourse elements; and it has also been described as
formulaic, that is, relying on “fixed sets of words” (Johnstone 1990, 218) to make
407
18
Connectives and conjunctions
1 I use the term “connective” after Al-Batal 1990, whose research on Arabic connectives has been
crucial to our understanding of their nature and importance. He gives the following definition:
“any element in a text which indicates a linking or transitional relationship between phrases,
clauses, sentences, paragraphs or larger units of discourse, exclusive of referential or lexical ties”
(1994, 91). Other terms used to refer to these words include “connectors,” “function words,” and
“particles.”
2 Schiffrin, in her work Discourse Markers, brings attention to the importance of cohesive elements as
interpretive links that connect the “underlying propositional content” of one discourse element
with another (1987, 9). She states that markers work “on the discourse level” and that they “have a
sequencing function of relating syntactic units and fitting them into a textual or discourse
context” (1987, 37).

semantic and syntactic links. In certain instances, short function words such as
wa- ‘and,’ actually function in Arabic texts as punctuation marks would function
in English texts. These connective words are therefore not always translatable
because they sometimes perform strictly grammatical functions rather than
adding semantic content. At the discourse or text level, the presence of appropri-
ate connectives is an important feature of “acceptability,” according to Al-Batal,
who notes that although “no explicit or formal rules exist,” interconnection
between sentences is essential to authentic Arabic texts.3
Connectives are therefore an important topic in studying Arabic. However, like
the category of adverbials, the class of words and phrases used as connectives is
large and heterogeneous. Different types of words and word groups serve as con-
nectives: conjunctions, adverbs, particles, and also certain idiomatic or set
phrases. These elements link at different discourse levels (phrase, clause, sen-
tence, paragraph) and in different ways, some simply coordinating or introducing
text elements, and others requiring particular grammatical operations (e.g., sub-
junctive mood on verb, accusative case on nouns). There are therefore differences
in the form, distribution, and function of connectives.4 Moreover, different
researchers classify members of these categories in different ways.
At the sentence level, traditional Arabic grammarians classify particles
(Huruuf ±hôM) according to whether or not they have a grammatical effect on
the following phrase or clause. For instance, the particle kay r»nc ‘in order that’
requires the following verb to be in the subjunctive mood; the negative particle
lam rºnd requires the verb to be in the jussive mood; and the subordinating con-
junction √anna s¿nCG ‘that’ requires the subject of the following clause to be either
a suffix pronoun or a noun in the accusative case. Thus the operational effect
(ﬁamal πnªnY) of the function word is a primary feature in its classification. The
effects of these particles on the syntax and inflectional status of sentence
elements form a major component in the theoretical framework and analysis
of Arabic syntax.5
Along these lines, connectives are presented here according to whether or not
they exercise a grammatical effect on the following sentence element.
408
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
3 Al-Batal points out that a lack of sentence-initial connectives in otherwise “perfectly grammatical”
Arabic texts written by nonnative speakers of Arabic reveals a stylistic gap that affects the accept-
ability of such texts, whose structures do not correspond with “the frequent usage of connectives
that is characteristic of Arabic written texts” (1990, 253).
4 For further discussion of the nature of Arabic connectives, see Al-Batal 1990 and 1994 as well as
Johnstone 1990. For further description and exercises with Arabic connectives, see al-Warraki and
Hassanein, 1994.
5 For analysis of Arabic syntactic theory in English, see Beeston 1970; Bohas, Guillaume, and
Kouloughli 1990, 49–72; Cantarino 1974–1976 (all three volumes); Holes 1995, 160–247 and
Wright II:1–349.

In one class are the many connecting words that serve linking functions
only, without requiring a grammatical change, called here “simple linking
connectives.”6
In the other class are the “operative particles” (Huruuf ﬁaamila á∏eÉY ±hôM)
that require inflectional modification of the phrase or clause that they introduce.
This class includes, for example, particles that require the subjunctive or the
jussive on following verbs, or particles that require the accusative case on nouns,
adjectives, and noun phrases. These “operative particles” are dealt with under
separate headings in this book. See the sections on subjunctive, jussive, negation
and exception, √inna and her sisters, and the section on cases and their functions.
In some instances, a connective may have more than one function and may fall
into both classes: simple linking and operative.7
This chapter deals primarily with simple linking connectives.
1 wa- ‘and’ (waaw al-ﬁaTf ∞£©dG hGh)
This connective is of the highest frequency of all (almost 50 percent of all Arabic
connectives) and occurs at all levels of text to “signal an additive relationship”
(Al-Batal 1990, 245).8
1.1 Sentence starter wa-
Sentences within an expository text after the introductory sentence are often
initiated with wa- ‘and’ and/or another connective expression. The following
examples are beginnings of typical sentences. As a sentence-starter, wa- is con-
sidered good style in Arabic, but it is not usually translated into English because
English style rules normally advise against starting sentences with ‘and.’

6 These include what Al-Batal refers to as Huruuf muhmala ‘inoperative particles,’ Huruuf zaa√ida
‘redundant or augmentative particles,’ and Huruuf al-ﬁaTf ‘coordinating particles’ (1990, 236).
7 For example, wa- as a coordinating conjunction does not exercise a grammatical effect on the
following phrase, but when used as the waaw al-maﬁiyya, ‘the waaw of accompaniment,’ it requires
the following noun to be in the accusative case. For more on this see Baalbaki 1986 and Wright
1967, II:83–84.
8 According to Schiffrin (1987, 141) “and” is “a discourse coordinator; the presence of and signals the
speaker’s identification of an upcoming unit which is coordinate in structure to some prior unit.”

1.2 Coordinating conjunction wa-
The coordinating conjunction wa- ‘and’ functions as an additive term within
sentences to link clauses, phrases, and words. In particular, Arabic uses wa- in lists
where in English a comma would be used to separate each item. The items in the
list retain the case determined by their role in the sentence.

2 fa- `na ‘and so; and then; yet; and thus’
This connector implies several different kinds of relationships with the previous text
elements. It can have a sequential meaning ‘and then,’ a resultative meaning ‘and so’
( faa√al-sababiyya áq«ÑÑ°ùdG AÉa), a contrastive meaning ‘yet; but,’ a slight shift in topic
‘and also; moreover’, or a conclusive meaning, ‘and therefore; in conclusion.’9
Beeston refers to it as “the most interesting of the ambivalent functionals” (1970, 98).

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
9 Al-Batal refers to it as “the most complex and the most interesting” connective in his research
because of the different functions that it has (1990, 100). Cantarino 1975, III:20–34 has an extensive
analysis of the functions of fa-, with examples taken from literary contexts.

It may start a sentence in a text or it may knit elements together within a
sentence.

3 Contrastive conjunctions
These conjunctions indicate contrast in semantic content between two parts of a
sentence.
3.1 bal rπnH ‘rather; but actually’
The word bal is termed an “adversative” by Al-Batal because it introduces a clause
whose semantic content conveys the idea of something additional but also different
or contrastive from the main clause.10
.áqjÈY ±hôëH É¡ª¶©e Öàc πH áq«æ«JÓdG ¤EG ÖàµdG √òg âªLôJh

4 Explanatory conjunctions
4.1 √ay r…CG ‘that is, i.e.’
This small word (which resembles in spelling the word √ayy- ‘which’ but is
unrelated to it) is an explicative particle equivalent to the Latin abbreviation i.e.,
for id est ‘that is,’ which is used in English texts.
q»©bGh ƒg Ée qπc  r…CG 
√ay, kull-u maa huwa waaqiﬁiyy-un
that is, everything that is real
5 Resultative conjunctions
5.1 √idh rPpEG ‘since,’ ‘inasmuch as’
This small word is a resultative particle that introduces a clause providing a
rationale or reason for the main clause.

5.2 √idhan r¿nPpEG (spelled with nuun) and √idh-an kGPpEG (spelled with nunation) ‘therefore;
then; so; thus; in that case’
This connective word initiates a clause or question that comes as a result or
conclusion from a previous statement. In more conversational style, it may also
come at the end of the clause.

5.3 Hattaa ≈qànM  past tense: ‘until’
Hattaa followed by a past tense verb introduces a clause that shows the conse-
quences or result of the previous clause. Used in this way, it refers to an event or
action that has taken place in the past.12
.á≤£æŸG ¿óe qºgCG øe âëÑ°UCG ≈qàM qƒªædG ‘ ∫õJ ⁄h

6 Adverbial conjunctions
Adverbial conjunctions in Arabic fill the role of subordinating conjunctions in
English such as ‘where,’ ‘when,’ ‘while,’ and ‘as.’ That is, they introduce a clause
subordinate to the main clause by indicating a place, time, manner, or result
relation between the two.
6.1 Adverbial conjunctions of place: Hayth-u oår«nM ‘where’
The connective adverb Hayth-u denotes the concept of ‘where’ or ‘in which.’ It has
an invariable Damma suffix.13 It is an extensively used conjunction of place. It also
has non-locative meanings when used with other particles, such as min Hayth-u
‘regarding; as for’ or bi-Hayth-u ‘so that; so as to.’ 14

Connectives and conjunctions
413
12 Hattaa may also be an operative particle with the meaning of ‘until; up to the point of,’ followed
by a noun in the genitive case (Hattaa l-sanat-i l-maaDiyat-i ‘until last year’), but in that case it is
considered a preposition. See Chapter 16, section 2.2.3. As a particle of purpose, it has the
meaning of ‘in order to’ followed by a verb in the subjunctive mood (see Chapter 34, section. 2.2.6).
13 Note that the question word ‘where?’ is different: √ayna. See Chapter 17, section 1.
14 For exercises on and further examples of the uses of Hayth-u, as well as the conjunctions Hayth-u
√anna and bi-Hayth-u, see al-Warraki and Hassanein 1994, 93–97.

6.2 Adverbial conjunctions of time
This category includes expressions that link clauses by specifying how one clause
is related to another in terms of time. These adverbials often consist of traditional
Zuruuf, the semi-prepositions or locative adverbs, plus the indefinite relative
pronoun maa, and sometimes the adverbial suffix -idhin.
The locative adverbs, as noted in the chapter on prepositions and prepositional
phrases, are essentially nouns of place that act as prepositions by going into a con-
struct relationship with another noun (e.g., Üô◊G ó©H baﬁd-a l-Harb-i ‘after the war,’
áæ°S πÑb qabl-a sanat-in ‘a year ago’). These nouns with the accusative marker are
restricted to occurring only before other nouns or pronouns unless a buffer (such
as maa or √idhin) is added to them. The locative adverb and buffer may be written
together as one word, or they are written separately. By adding the buffer
element, the semi-prepositions or locative adverbs are converted into adverbial
elements that can directly precede verbs and entire clauses.
6.2.1 bayn-a-maa Éªnær«nH ‘while; whereas’
This connective word has both a temporal meaning ‘while, during the time that,’
and also a contrastive meaning of ‘whereas.’
.QqóıG ¿ƒµ∏¡à°ùj GƒfÉc Éªæ«H Gƒ£Ño°V
DubiT-uu bayn-a-maa kaan-uu ya-stahlik-uuna l-muxaddir-a.

Arabic culture was official whereas vernacular Latin remained a language of the

6.2.2 baﬁd-a-maa Éenór©nH ‘after’
This connective is usually followed directly by a past tense verb. Note that the
preposition baﬁd-a ‘after’ can be followed only by a noun or pronoun; it is necessary
to use baﬁd-a-maa before a clause beginning with a verb.

6.2.3 baﬁd-a √an r¿nCG nór©nH ‘after’
The expression baﬁd-a √an means essentially the same as baﬁd-a maa when describing
a situation that has taken place in the past. The phrase baﬁd-a √an, when referring
to an event that has already taken place, is followed by a clause with a past tense
verb.15

6.2.3 baﬁd-a-√idhin mòpFnór©nH ‘after that; then; subsequently’
This compound expression is equivalent in most situations to the adverbial
conjunction thumma (see below 6.2.8):
.Ëôc QGO ¤EG π≤àfG mòFó©Hh

15 When referring to a non-past situation, or a hypothetical situation, baﬁd-a √an is followed by a verb
in the subjunctive mood. For example,

6.2.7 qabl-a √an r¿CG nπrÑnb  subjunctive ‘before’
Contrasting with baﬁd-a √an, qabl-a √an refers to an action anterior to the action in
the main clause. The verb after qabl-a √an is in the subjunctive mood, even if the
main clause reference is past tense.

7 Disjunctives
Arabic has a set of particles that indicate disjunction, that is, a distinction
between one alternative and another. They include the following:
Connectives and conjunctions
417
16 As for the expressions Hasab-a and bi-Hasab-i ‘according to,’ these are not conjunctions but operative
particles that are followed by a noun in the genitive case.
17 For another word meaning ‘perhaps’ see laﬁalla in Chapter 19 on √inna and her sisters.

7.1 √aw rhnCG ‘or’
This disjunctive indicates an option between two or more elements, but that
option is inclusive, that is, it may include one, both, or all the elements.

8 Sentence-starting connectives
In addition to single words as sentence-introducers and connectors, there are also
many fixed expressions or idiomatic phrases that serve to start sentences. This
process of using a starting formula to introduce a sentence is especially common
in journalistic and expository writing and gives it what Johnstone refers to as a
certain “formulaicity.” 18 Some of the more common phrasal starters are listed
here.
8.1 Participle or adjective starters with min-a l-
A definite adjective or passive participle, often preceded by the partitive preposition
min, is a common way of introducing a sentence, especially in journalistic prose.
This use of min is termed “pleonastic” (superfluous or redundant).19 It is a way of
opening a statement with a generic or general observation, just as “It is . . .” may be
used in English.
. . . ¿CG ™qbƒàŸG øeh
. . . q¿CG øµªŸG øe
wa-min-a l-mutawaqqaﬁ-i √an . . .
min-a l-mumkin-i √an . . .

min-a l-muhimm-i ﬁadam-u taqdiim-i l-kathiir-i min-a l-tanaazulaat-i.
It is important not to offer too many concessions.
. . . IQÉjõH Ωƒ≤f ¿CG q»©«Ñ£dG øe
min-a l-Tabiiﬁiyy-i √an na-quum-a bi-ziyaarat-in . . .
It is natural that we undertake a visit . . .
8.1.1 Starters without min
Sometimes participle or adjective starters are used on their own, without min, but
usually preceded by wa-.
. . . q¿CG  Ωƒ∏©eh
. . . q¿CG Üô¨à°ùŸGh
wa-maﬁluum-un √anna . . .
wa-l-mustaghrab-u √anna . . .
It is known that . . .
The strange [thing] is . . .
8.2 Passive and passive-like starters
With or without wa- a passive verb in the third person masculine singular may
initiate a sentence by introducing a general, unattributed observation. In
addition to the morphological passive, a Form V or Form VII verb with passive
meaning is sometimes used.

8.3 Other idiomatic starters
Some other phrases used to start sentences typically include the following.
8.3.1 Topic shift: √ammaa . . . fa- `na . . . ÉqeCG ‘as for . . .’
This expression denotes a shift in topic from the previous sentence. It is in two
parts, the first word, √ammaa, signaling the new topic, and the second, fa-, intro-
ducing the comment on that topic. In English, the “as for” phrase is here followed
by a comma, which introduces the second part of the sentence, or comment.
Therefore fa- in this case fills the same function as the punctuation mark in
English. Since √ammaa introduces a new sentence and a new topic, the noun
following is in the nominative case, as subject of the sentence.

1 Introduction
This group of particles, referred to as √inna wa-√axawaat-u-haa É¡JGƒNCGh q¿EG ‘√inna
and her sisters,’ are part of the class of Arabic words that are referred to as
nawaasix ï°SGƒf, or words that cause a shift to the accusative case.1 The members
of this particular group are usually used as subordinating conjunctions, connect-
ing two clauses, although √inna itself may also be used at the beginning of a
sentence.
These particles include:2
verily, indeed; that
√inna

√anna

1.1 Grammatical effect
These particles have the grammatical effect of making the subject noun in the fol-
lowing clause accusative. If there is no overt subject noun in the clause, a suffix
pronoun is affixed to the particle.
19
Subordinating conjunctions: the particle
√inna and her sisters
1 For more on the nawaasix, see Chapter 7, section 5.3.3.8.
Arabic grammars refer to particles that require the accusative as Huruuf mushabbiha bi-l-fiﬁl
‘particles resembling verbs’ because transitive verbs require the accusative on their direct objects.
There is therefore a parallel relationship between these two elements; they are both “operators” or
“governors” (ﬁawaamil), and both have similar effects on a following noun or noun phrase. As
Anghelescu states, “it must not be forgotten that √inna, as well as other members of the 
al-nawaasikh class, resemble verbs in their capacity to ‘act’ (ﬁamal), or to govern, according to the
Arab grammarians” (1999, 136).
2 The subordinating particle √an is also sometimes considered in this category, although it is
different in that it is followed by a verb in the subjunctive mood, rather than a noun in the
accusative case. For more on √an and the subjunctive, see Chapter 34, section 2.3.

1.2 Overt noun subject
When the subject noun in the following clause is overt, it receives the accusative
case and usually follows directly after the particle. Note that the form of the accu-
sative case may vary according to the declension of the noun.

1.3 Separated subject
The accusative subject noun does not have to be immediately adjacent to the par-
ticle – it may be separated from the particle by an adverb or a prepositional
phrase. It may not, however, be separated from the subordinating particle by a
verb.3

1.4 Reduplicated pronoun subject
If the subject of the subordinated clause is shown only by the inflection of a verb,
then a subject pronoun suffix duplicating the subject of the verb is affixed to
3 “The accusative case is not necessarily immediately subsequent to the particle; e.g., it may follow
the predicate in a nominal sentence. A verb, however, may never be placed between a particle and
the accusative it governs” Cantarino 1975, III:117.

the particle. The subject, whether a noun or a pronoun, must at all times come
before its verb in this type of subordinate clause.

1.5 Equational clause
If the clause after √inna or one of her sisters is an equational sentence, the subject
is a pronoun or a noun in the accusative case, but the predicate (xabar) is in the
nominative case.
!kGóL lπ«≤K  ¬qfEG

1.6 With invariable pronoun or noun
Sometimes √inna or one of her sisters may be followed by an invariable noun or
pronoun, in which case there is no overt accusative marker.4
.á©°ûH áÁôL  √òg q¿EG
.»Øµj ’ Gòg  qøµd
√inna haadhihi jariimat-un bashiﬁat-un.
laakinna haadhaa laa ya-kfii.
(Indeed,) this is a repugnant crime.
But this is not enough.
1.7 With buffer pronoun: Damiir al-sha√n ¿CÉ°ûdG Òª°V
Occasionally in MSA a subordinate clause may be preceded by a /-hu/ pronoun
after the subordinating particle (e.g., √anna-hu ¬qfCG) that does not seem to be neces-
sary or even to agree with the subject of the verb. This pronoun refers not to the
subject of the clause, but to the entire clause itself, and acts as a generic “buffer”
between the subordinating particle and the following clause. In Arabic this par-
ticular use of the suffix pronoun is called Damiir al-sha√n ‘the pronoun of the fact’
or “pronoun which anticipates a whole subsequent clause.”5
4 According to traditional Arabic grammatical theory, the accusative marking is there in a “virtual”
sense (muqaddar), even though it does not appear on the word.

2 The particles
2.1 Sentence-initial √inna s¿EG: ‘indeed, truly, verily’
The particle √inna has a truth-intensifying function when used at the beginning of
a statement. It emphasizes that what follows is true. More frequently used in Clas-
sical Arabic than MSA, it nonetheless occurs occasionally in MSA, especially when
reporting an official speech.6
.ΩÉghCG ¤EG âdqƒ–  n∫ÉeB’G  q¿EG

2.2 Subordinating √inna ‘that’
The particle √inna is also used as a way of introducing reported speech. As a sub-
ordinating conjunction, it is used exclusively after the verb qaal-a ‘to say.’7
.´ƒ°VƒŸG Gòg ¢ûbÉf  ¬qfEG ∫Ébh
wa-qaal-a √inna-hu naaqash-a haadha l-mawDuuﬁ-a.

qaal-a √inna l-siyaasiyy-iina ya-staxdim-uuna muSTalaHaat-in diiniyyat-an.
He said that the politicians use religious terminology.
2.3 √anna s¿CG ‘that’
The particle √anna is used to report factual information in a subordinate clause.
It is used with the meaning of ‘that’ after perception verbs such as samiﬁ-a ‘hear,’
6 Dahlgren, in his study of Arabic word order, reports that √inna is “a particle for marking the
thematization of (mainly or exclusively) the subject by letting it precede the verb in the
sentence”(1998, 217).
7 Note that in English the word “that” may be omitted in reporting speech, but √inna may not be
omitted in Arabic.

426
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
iﬁtaqad-a, iftakar-a ‘think’ or ‘believe,’ and also with verbs of communicating such
as dhakar-a ‘mention,’ √akkad-a ‘assert, declare’, or √aﬁlan-a ‘announce.’8 Belnap in
his study of complementation in MSA states that “√anna occurs with verbs that
assume or claim that the following clause’s assertion is statement of fact.”9
The verb in the main clause is referred to in some studies as the “matrix” verb
because it determines the nature of the complementizer or subordinating parti-
cle that follows it (whether it is √anna or √an).10 Note that if the matrix verb
requires a preposition, √anna follows the preposition.

8 Note that √anna ( noun in the accusative) and √an ( verb in the subjunctive) are related particles
which differ in their distribution. According to LeComte (1968, 120), “la subordination complétive
s’exprime avec √an ou √anna (que) qui ne sont que deux formes de la même particule. Elles se
distinguent toutefois par leur emploi syntaxique: √an entraîne normalement un verbe à l’inacc.
subj. (subjunctive) . . . √anna ne peut être suivie que d’un nom au cas direct ou d’un pronom
affixe.” See also Chapter 34, section 2.3.
9 In a personal communication to the author, summarizing his findings in Belnap 1986. Note that
matrix verbs indicating attitudes such as intention, feeling, possibility, need, or desire are
followed by the subordinating particle √an plus a subjunctive verb, not by √anna. See Anghelescu
1999, 138 on √anna, especially as compared with √an; and Cantarino 1975, II: 234–35 and 
III:106–107.

2.3.1 ka-√anna s¿CÉnc ‘as though’
The preposition ka- may be prefixed to the subordinating conjunction √anna ‘that’
in order to form the expression “as though.” This expression is still a sister of √inna
and has the same effect on the following clause.

laakinna l-barnaamaj-a ya-bqaa fii l-kumbyuutir
but the program remains in the computer
2.4.1 laakin øpµd / wa-laakin øpµdh ‘but’
This variant of laakinna, written without the shadda or fatHa on the nuun, is not a
sister of √inna and can therefore be followed directly by a verb. It is not as frequent
in written Arabic as laakinna. In written text, it is almost impossible to tell the dif-
ference between these two particles, except that laakin may be followed by a verb.
áÑbGôeh §HGƒ°V ™°Vh Öéj  øµdh

2.6 laﬁalla sπn©nd / wa-laﬁalla sπn©ndnh ‘perhaps, maybe’
This particle is similar in meaning to rubba-maa ‘perhaps,’ but is a sister of √inna.
Like √inna, it may start a sentence as well as a clause. If it is followed by a verbal
sentence, the subject of the verb must reduplicate itself in the form of a pronoun
prefix attached to laﬁalla. Abboud and McCarus state that laﬁalla “often has the
implication of hopeful expectation” (1983, Part 1:519).
.áq£ﬂ ô°UÉæY ∫qhCG kÓ©a ÉæjCGQ Éæq∏©dh

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

Arabic verbs fall into two major groups, those with three-consonant roots
(triliteral) and those with four-consonant roots (quadriliteral). Around each lexi-
cal root is structured a set of possible stem classes or verb forms (normally ten for
triliteral roots and four for quadriliteral).1 Moreover, each Arabic verb has a corre-
sponding verbal noun (maSdar Qó°üe), an active participle (ism faaﬁil πYÉa º°SG), and
often, a passive participle (ism mafﬁuul ∫ƒ©Øe º°SG). Thus verbs and their derivatives
form the foundation for substantial amounts of Arabic vocabulary and can be
considered in some ways as the core of the Arabic lexicon.2
1 Verb roots
Every Arabic verb has a lexical root, that is, a set of consonants or phonemes in a
specific order that embody a broad lexical meaning, such as k-t-b ‘write’; h-n-d-s
‘engineer’; d-r-s ‘study’; ﬁ-l-m ‘know’. These roots may consist of three or four con-
sonants, with three being the most common. Within these two different root
types, there are phonological variations according to the nature of the consonant
phonemes occurring in the root.
This is mainly to do with the fact that the semivowels /w/ (waaw) and /y/ (yaa√)
are not full-fledged consonants; they are weak in the sense that there are restric-
tions on how they combine with and interact with vowels. Sometimes when these
semi-consonants are root phonemes, they behave as regular consonants, some-
times, however, they shift into long vowels, or they may become short vowels, or
they turn into hamza, or in some cases, they disappear altogether. This can be con-
fusing when learners need to identify the consonantal root of a word in order to
look it up in a dictionary, so it is important for learners to have a basic under-
standing of how root types interact with rules for word formation.
429

Verb classes
1 These stem classes are sometimes referred to in current literature on morphological theory as
binyanim (singular binyan), using the Hebrew term. See Aronoff 1994, especially Chapter 5: 123–164.
Note also that there are in fact fifteen (rather then ten) potential verb forms for triliteral verb
roots. But Forms XI–XV are rare in MSA. For more on Forms XI–XV see Chapter 32.
2 Kouloughli (1994, 215) gives the following description of the “deverbal” derivatives: “Tout verbe a
dans son sillage des formes déverbales qui lui sont associées et avec lesquelles il entretient des
relations morphologiques, syntaxiques et sémantiques stables.” 

There are phonotactic rules — rules of sound distribution — for Arabic words,
many of which were deduced by Arabic grammarians as long ago as the eighth cen-
tury (AD), and which remain valid today for MSA.3 Whenever possible here, these
rules are described and applied in order to explain variations in word structure.
Arabic verb roots are classified into two major classes: SaHiiH ‘sound’ and
muﬁtall ‘weak.’ Sound roots are ones that do not contain either waaw or yaa√;
“weak” roots contain waaw or yaa√as one or more of the root phonemes. It is
essential to know these classes because verb inflection affects the phonological
structure of the verb root in all cases except the regular or sound triliteral root.
Within the two major classes of verbal roots, further classification occurs in
several subcategories. Each of the subcategories manifests particular variation in
the root. This variation is rule-governed, but complex.4
1.1 Regular (sound) triliteral root (al-ﬁﬁl al-SaHiiH al-saalim ⁄É°ùdG í«ë°üdG π©ØdG)
Sound or regular verbal roots consist of three consonants, all of which are differ-
ent and none of which are waaw, yaa√, or hamza. For example:

1.2 Geminate verb root (al-ﬁﬁl al-muDaﬁﬁaf ∞q©°†ŸG π©ØdG)
Geminate or doubled verbal roots are ones where the second and third consonant of the
root are the same. They show an alternation between repetition of the geminate
consonant, with a vowel between, and doubling of the consonant, under specific
phonological conditions.5

3 Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad (d. ca. 791) pioneered Arabic phonological theory and developed the theory of
root phonotactics in his introduction to the first Arabic dictionary, the Kitaab al-ﬁayn. For more on
this, see Sara 1991.
4 See Killean 1978 for mnemonic aids to weak verb inflection and Timothy Mitchell 1981 for
description of phonological rules in hollow and defective verbs. Extensive and useful descriptions
of the morphophonemic rules for geminate, assimilated, hollow, and defective verbs are found in
Abboud and McCarus 1983, Part 2: 1-173.
5 For an analysis of the nature of geminate root morphology, see Moore 1990.

1.3 Hamzated verb root (al-ﬁﬁl al-mahmuuz Rƒª¡ŸG π©ØdG)
A hamzated verb root is one where hamza (the glottal stop) occurs as the first, sec-
ond, or third consonant. These verbs are considered a separate category because
of morphophonemic rules that govern the occurrence and distribution of hamza,
and also because of hamza spelling rules.

1.4 Roots with semi-consonants
1.4.1 Assimilated verb root (al-fiﬁl al-mithaal ∫ÉãŸG π©ØdG)
“Assimilated” verb roots begin with a semi-consonant (waaw or yaa√), most often
waaw. They are termed “assimilated” because this waaw, even though it is part of
the root, often disappears in the present tense and in certain other situations.

1.4.2 Hollow verb root (al-ﬁﬁl al-√ajwaf ±ƒLC’G π©ØdG)
“Hollow” verbs are ones in which the second or middle root consonant is either
waaw or yaa√. These two consonants undergo various mutations, turning into √alif,
a short vowel, a hamza, or a long vowel depending on the word structure. In the past
tense citation form, for example, the waaw or yaa√is not present and is replaced by
√alif. However, to look up one of these words or its derivation in a dictionary, one
must know what the middle root consonant is. The root consonant often recurs in
the present tense verb stem (as a vowel) and elsewhere, as will be shown. There are
essentially three variations on the hollow verb, determined by which long vowel is
present in the present-tense or imperfective stem: waaw, yaa√or √alif.

1.4.4 Doubly weak or “mixed” verb roots
Doubly weak verb roots have semi-consonants and/or hamza in two places, some-
times as the first and third consonants, and sometimes as the second and third.
They are not many in number, but some of them are frequently used:

1.5 Quadriliteral verb root (al-ﬁﬁl al-rubaaﬁiyy q»YÉHôdGπ©ØdG)
Quadriliteral verb roots contain four consonants. Sometimes the four consonants
are all different and sometimes they are reduplicated, that is, the first two conso-
nants are repeated. Reduplicated quadriliteral roots are often considered to be
onomatopoeic, that is, derived from particular sounds or repeated motions.

1.6 Denominal verb roots
Normally, the verb is considered the most basic or elemental form of a lexical
entry, but in a few instances, the verb is ultimately derived from a noun, and
sometimes the concept is borrowed from another language. These denominals
tend to exist chiefly in Forms II and V and rarely in other forms. They can be trilit-
eral or quadriliteral. Some examples of denominal verbs include:
Form II:
to unite
waHHada
óqMh
w-H-d
O - ì - h
to appoint
ﬁayyana
øq«Y
ﬁ-y-n
¿ - … - ´
Form V:
to adopt
tabannaa
≈qæÑJ
b-n
¿ - Ü
Form II quadriliteral:
to center
tamarkaza
õcô“
m-r-k-z6
R - ∑ - Q - Ω
2 Verb derivation patterns: √awzaan al-ﬁﬁl π©ØdG ¿GRhCG
2.1 Comparison with English
In English, it is possible to modify verb meanings or even create verbs from
other parts of speech through several morphological procedures, for example,
prefixing the morpheme /un-/ as in undo, unfasten, unlock, unpack, indicating the
reversal of an action. Nouns and adjectives can be converted into verbs by
adding the suffix /-en/, as in strengthen or widen indicating an increase of that
quality. Or one can, for example, create verbs by using the suffix /-ize/ as in stan-
dardize, mechanize, minimize, maximize, formalize, or trivialize, to indicate the act of
adding that quality to something. And there are many more such procedures.
Other parts of speech, such as prepositions, adverbs, and nouns are converted to
verbs just by inflecting them as verbs: “to down a glass of water,” “to up the
price,” “to impact a situation.”
Arabic verb derivation is much more restricted; Arabic verbs fall into a limited
number of stem classes. It is much rarer for new verbs to be created in Modern
Standard Arabic than in English because each Arabic verb belongs to a particular
derivational and inflectional class. That is, it has a particular internal shape, or
pattern.

6 In this instance, the word markaz, ‘center,’ a noun of place from the triliteral root r-k-z, has taken
on such a lexical identity of its own that a denominal verb form has emerged based on the four
consonants, m-r-k-z.

2.2 The ten-form template: √afﬁaal mujarrada wa-√afﬁaal maziida 
Iójõe ∫É©aCGh IOqô› ∫É©aCG
Arabic has a verb grid, or template of ten derived “forms” into which any trilit-
eral verb root may theoretically fit.7 That is, the lexical root of three consonants
can theoretically interlock with ten different patterns to produce ten lexical
variants on the same root. These variants all have a central, related lexical
meaning, but each verb form has a different semantic slant on that meaning.
For example, different forms of the lexical root ﬁ-l-m produce verbs having to do
with knowledge: Form I ﬁalim-a means ‘to know, to be informed’ Form II ﬁallam-a
means ‘to teach’ (cause someone to know), Form IV √aﬁlama means ‘to inform’
(cause someone to be informed), Form V taﬁallama means ‘to learn, to study’
(cause one’s self to know). The triconsonantal sequence ﬁ-l-m is common to all
these lexical items.
The base form, or Form I is referred to in Arabic as fiﬁl mujarrad Oqô› π©a, liter-
ally the ‘stripped’ form; meaning the morphologically simplest form. All other
forms (II–X) are referred to as √afﬁaal maziida Iójõe ∫É©aCG, literally, ‘increased’ or
‘augmented’ forms, i.e., more morphologically complex.
In practice, not every lexical root occurs in all ten forms of the verb; some occur
in very few forms, while others occur in four, five, or six forms. Dictionaries nor-
mally list all the forms in which a lexical root regularly appears.
The interlocking of the lexical root with the various verb form templates cre-
ates actual verbs whose meanings can often be analyzed or deduced through the
use of compositional semantics. That is, the lexical meaning of the consonantal
root plus the grammatical meaning of the particular template combine to yield
an actual word. This two-part formula sometimes yields a very clear meaning
derivable from the component parts, but other times, the meaning is not as clear
because of its evolution over time.8
Quadriliteral verbs have a more restricted grid of four possible templates or
forms into which they fall.
434
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
7 As mentioned in note 1, there are a possible five more forms, XI–XV, but they are much rarer.
8 As a concise summary of the interrelationships of the Arabic verb forms, Lecomte (1968, 34) writes:
“Si l’on met à part la forme dérivée IX, qui est nettement en marge du système, et la forme VII,
commune à tout le domaine sémitique et de constitution claire, on peut expliquer comme suit
la formation des autres formes dérivées: les formes I, II, III et IV sont les quatre formes de base,
auxquelles correspondent respectivement les formes VIII, V, VI et X, obtenues en principe par
préfixation d’un t- , qui leur confère une valeur réfléchie-passive. Le principe est appliqué sans
altération dans les formes dérivées V et VI. Dans la forme dérivée VIII, on observe une métathèse
immédiatement perceptible. La forme dérivée X est issue non de la forme dérivée IV à préfixe
hamza, mais d’une forme dérivée IV à préfixe s- qui a existé dans d’autres langues sémitiques
(ex. assyrien tardif).”

2.2.1 Conventions
2.2.1.1 FORMS AND MEASURES (√awzaan ¿GRhCG): The derivations or verb templates
are identified by the morphological pattern that characterizes them and are often
referred to in western grammars of Arabic as “forms” or “measures” of the verb.
They are usually identified in English by a roman numeral, i.e., Form II or Form VI.
In this convention, when the word “form” refers to a specific verb template, it is
capitalized, e.g., Form II. Since this is a widespread convention in the United
States and Europe, and because it is the way that verbs are identified in the most
widely used Arabic-English dictionary, Hans Wehr’s Dictionary of Modern Written
Arabic, it is used in this reference grammar.
Arabic grammars term the verb forms √awzaan ‘weights’ or ‘measures’ (sg. wazn
¿Rh), and refer to them via the medium of a model root (traditionally f-ﬁ-l π©a)
keyed into particular morphological patterns. The base form is mujarrad ‘stripped,
bare’ and the derived forms are maziid ‘augmented’ on the model of a particular
pattern, for example,
π©àaG ¿Rh ≈∏Y zÖîàfG{
“intaxab” ﬁalaa wazn-i ftaﬁal; 
i.e., intaxab ‘he elected’ is on the model of iftaﬁal;
πq©ØJ ¿Rh ≈∏Y zÖqæŒ{
“tajannab” ﬁalaa wazn-i tafaﬁﬁal;
tajannab ‘he avoided’ is on the model of tafaﬁﬁal.
2.2.1.2 CITATION FORM FOR VERBS: The conventional way of citing Arabic verbal
roots is to refer to them using the shortest verb inflection, the third person
masculine singular, past tense. This is considered equivalent to using the English
citation form, the infinitive (there is no infinitive verb form in Arabic9). It is
helpful to cite the verb in its past and present forms together, and that is how they
are presented in this book. For example:
to discuss
baHath-a/ya-bHath-u
oånërÑnj / nånënH
to reveal
kashaf-a/ya-kshif-u
o∞p°ûrµnj / ∞n°ûnc
Verb classes
435
9 The verbal noun, or maSdar, is considered equivalent to the infinitive for several reasons: first, it is
an abstraction of the action of a verb, and second√it does not possess a time reference (i.e., tense
marking) and is therefore non-finite. Moreover, in certain syntactic constructions it functions as
an infinitive does in English. However, it is not used as a citation form for the verb.

2.3 The model root: f-ﬁ-l (faa√-ﬁayn - laam ∫- ´ - ±)
In order to exemplify patterns or prosodic templates in Arabic, a model root f- ﬁ-l
is used so that any pattern can be referred to or expressed by fitting into it.10 This
procedure was established centuries ago when Arabic grammarians first started
extracting and analyzing the rules and structures of the language, and it is still
the practice today. Any initial root consonant is represented by faa√, any medial
consonant by ﬁayn, and any final root consonant by laam.11 The Form IV verb
√arsala (‘to send’) would be said to be on the pattern of √afﬁala (ﬁalaa wazn √afﬁal-a
nπn©ranCG ¿Rh ≈∏Y); the verb katab-a (‘to write’) is on the pattern of faﬁal-a (ﬁalaa wazn
faﬁal-a nπn©na ¿Rh ≈∏Y), and so forth.
If a root or stem has four consonants instead of three, then another laam is
added to illustrate the pattern. Thus the verb tarjam-a (‘to translate’) would be said
to be on the pattern of faﬁlal-a (ﬁalaa wazn faﬁlal-a nπn∏r©na ¿Rh ≈∏Y).
The use of the root f- ﬁ-l as the prime exemplar for all Arabic words is a power-
ful symbolic formalization that provides a model of any morphological template
or word pattern. This procedure is used not only to refer to verb forms but also to
refer to any lexical item based on the root and pattern system. It is an efficient
way of illustrating paradigmatic contrasts, and in keeping with this practice, this
reference grammar uses the root f-ﬁ-l for points of reference and examples. 
2.4 Morphological shifts
When a non-sound root interlocks with a particular pattern, a situation arises
where rules of phonology intersect and may clash with rules of morphology, so a
modification of the word-structure occurs. When this happens, the rules of
phonology are primary. These instances result, therefore, in what are called mor-
phophonemic processes, i.e., rule-governed changes in word structure. These
rules generate particular inflectional classes (e.g., Form VIII hollow verbs) which
are illustrated in paradigms.
Although it may seem that there are many exceptions to rules in Arabic, the
fact is that Arabic phonological structure and rules of phonotactics are primary,
and they determine the sequences of morphological alternations that occur. The
phonological rules of Arabic and how they interact with the morphology result in
morphological structures of Arabic being coherent and rule-governed.
436
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
10 The lexical root f-ﬁ-l has the base meaning of ‘doing’ or ‘making.’ 
11 The letters/phonemes of the model root are referred to in Arabic as Huruuf al-miizaan al-Sarfiyy ‘the
letters of the morphological measure.’ As described by Abd al-Latif et al., “bi-Hayth-u ta-kuun-a haad-
hihi l-Huruuf-u l-thalaathat-u mushakkalat-an bi-Harakaat-i √aHruf-i l-kalimat-i l-muraad-i wazn-u-haa wazn-
an Sarfiyy-an” (1997, 141). “In order that these three letters be vowelized with the vowels of the
word whose pattern is desired.”

This reference grammar defines and describes some basic MSA morphophone-
mic processes in order to make clear the systematization in the language. How-
ever, learners who would prefer to focus on forms rather than rules can consult
the paradigms without examining the morphophonemic processes.
2.5 The verb forms: patterns, meanings, deverbal substantives
Verb patterns are traditionally given in their citation forms, the third person mas-
culine singular active past tense, as well as the third person masculine singular
present tense. This is a standard procedure for citing Arabic verbs, since there is a
stem change between past and present tense.
It is traditional to refer to the short vowel which follows the second root
consonant of a verb as the “stem” vowel. Therefore in a present tense verb such
as ya-rfuD-u ‘he refuses,’ the stem vowel is Damma. In a derived verb form such as
Form VIII ya-HtafiZ-u ‘he maintains,’ the stem vowel is kasra.
Verb citations are provided in Arabic script and in transcription; for discussion
of consonant–vowel patterning, consonant-vowel structures are also sometimes
given, using the convention: 
C  Consonant; 
V  short vowel
C1 represents the first root consonant,
VV  long vowel
C2 represents the second and 
C3 represents the third.
C4 represents the fourth consonant (if any)
In the following chapters, each verb form is described, with its particular
patterns and meanings. Inflectional characteristics are noted, and examples are
provided.
As mentioned at the start of this section, each verb form has in its wake a set of
three deverbal substantives: a verbal noun (the name of the action, e.g., ‘defense,’ or
‘defending’), an active participle (describing the doer of the action: ‘defender’ or
‘[person] defending’) and a passive participle (describing the item which undergoes
the action, e.g., ‘defended’). Whereas the verbal noun is used strictly as a noun, the
participles, being descriptors, may function either as nouns or as adjectives. Differ-
ent sections of this book describe the form and function of verbal nouns and par-
ticiples, but because they form such an integral part of the lexical repository of
each verb, they are also listed in the context of their deverbal derivations.

438
1 Verb inﬂection
Arabic verbs inflect for six morphological categories: gender, number, person,
tense, mood, and voice. These inflections are marked by means of prefixes, suf-
fixes, changes in vowel pattern, and stem changes. The first three categories,
gender, number, and person, are determined by the subject of the verb. That is,
the verb agrees with the subject in all those respects.
1.1 Agreement markers: gender, number, and person
Agreement markers ensure that the verb inflects in accordance with the nature
of its subject. Arabic verbs inflect by means of affixes attached to a verb stem. In
the past tense, the inflectional marker is a suffix that carries all the agreement
markers: gender, number, and person. For example: the suffix /-at/ on a past tense
stem such as katab- (katab-atrânÑnànc) carries the information: third person, feminine,
singular: i.e., “she wrote.”
In the present tense, the verb stem has a prefix as well as a suffix. For exam-
ple, prefix ya- on a present tense stem such as -ktub- carries partial information:
third person. The suffix on the present tense stem carries more information:
therefore the suffix -uuna (as in ya-ktub-uuna n¿ƒÑoàrµnj ‘they write’) gives informa-
tion on number (plural) and gender (masculine), as well as mood (indicative).
This combination of information is uniquely marked on each member in a verb
paradigm.1
1.1.1 Gender: masculine or feminine
Arabic verbs are marked for masculine or feminine gender in the second and
third persons. The first person (I, we) is gender-neutral. 
21
Verb inflection: a summary
1 In technical linguistic terms, Arabic is a “pro-drop” (i.e., “pronoun-drop”) language. That is,
every inflection in a verb paradigm is specified uniquely and does not need to use independent
pronouns to differentiate the person, number, and gender of the verb. For Modern Standard
Arabic that means that there are thirteen different inflections in every verb paradigm. Consult
Haegeman 1994, 19–25 and 454–57 for more on pro-drop languages and the pro-drop parameter
in general.

Verb inflection: a summary
439
1.1.2 Number: singular, dual, plural
Arabic verbs are inflected for three number categories: singular, dual, or plural.
The dual in Arabic verbs is used in the second person (“you two”) and in the third
person (“they two”), but not the first person.
1.1.3 Person: ﬁrst, second, third
The concept of “person” refers to the individual/s involved in the speech act: the
one/s speaking (first person), the one/s spoken to (second person), and one/s spo-
ken about (third person). Arabic verbs inflect for: first person (I, we), second per-
son (you), and third person (she, he, they).
1.2 Tense
The two basic Arabic verb tenses differ in terms of stems as well as inflectional
markers.
1.2.1 Verb stems
Each Arabic verb has two stems, one used for the perfect/past tense and one for
the imperfect/present. The past tense stem takes suffixes in order to inflect, and the
present tense stem takes both prefixes and suffixes. Because of the salience of
the prefix in the present tense and of the suffix in the past tense, certain scholars
refer to these tenses as “the prefix set” and “the suffix set,” respectively.2
In Form I verbs, the present tense inflectional stem is not usually predictable
from the past tense stem, but in the derived forms and quadriliteral verbs, the
present stem is predictable. In this text, stems are usually written with a hyphen
where they would connect with inflectional formatives,3 e.g.

1.2.2 Tense/Aspect
Arabic verbs show a range of tenses, but two of them are basic: past and present.
These tenses are also often referred to as perfect and imperfect, or perfective and
2 For example, see Holes 1995, 86–90 and Beeston 1970, 71–86.
3 Where the prefix or suffix merges with the verb stem (as in the past tense of defective verbs or the
present tense of passive assimilated verbs) the morpheme boundary is blurred and therefore not
indicated.

440
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
imperfective, but those latter terms are more accurately labels of aspect rather
than tense.
Tense and aspect can be described as two different ways of looking at time. Tense
usually deals with linear points in time that stretch from the far past into the
future, in relation to the speaker. Aspect, on the other hand deals with the degree
of completeness of an action or state: is the action completed, partial, ongoing, or
yet to occur? So the perspectives of tense and aspect are different: tense focuses on
the point on the timeline at which the action occurs, whereas aspect is focused on
the action itself – whether it is complete or not.4
The difference between tense and aspect can be subtle, and the two categories
may overlap to a significant extent. It is theorized that Classical Arabic was more
aspect-specific than tense-specific, but in dealing with the modern written lan-
guage, some linguists and teachers find it more pragmatic to describe Arabic
verbs in terms of tense.5
In this work, I often use the term “past tense” to refer to what is also called the
perfect, or the perfective aspect; and I use the term “present tense” to refer to
what is also called the imperfect tense or the imperfective aspect. In general, I prefer
to stick with timeline terms (“past” and “present”) when using the term “tense”
because I have found this to be less confusing to learners.6
4 “Tense involves the basic location in time of an event or state of affairs, in relation to the time of
speaking (or writing), while aspect relates more to the internal nature of events and states of
affairs, such as whether they are (or were) finished, long-lasting, instantaneous, repetitive, the
beginning of something, the end of something, and so on” (Hurford 1994, 240). Abboud and
McCarus use the terms “perfect tense” and “imperfect tense” (1983, part 1:263): “The perfect tense
denotes completed actions; the imperfect tense denotes actions which have not taken place or
have not been completed.” 
Likewise, Haywood and Nahmad state (1962, 95–96): “Arabic, in common with other Semitic
languages, is deficient in tenses, and this does not make for ease in learning. Moreover the tenses
do not have accurate time-significances as in Indo-European languages. There are two main tenses,
the Perfect »°VÉŸG al-maaDii, denoting actions completed at the time to which reference is being 
made; and the Imperfect ´QÉ°†ŸG al-muDaariﬁ, for incompleted actions.”
5 For a thorough and lucid discussion of Arabic verb aspect and tense see Blachère and Gaudefroy-
Demombynes 1975, 245–56. More concisely, Wright states the following: “A Semitic Perfect or
Imperfect has, in and of itself, no reference to the temporal relations of the speaker (thinker or
writer) and of other actions which are brought into juxtaposition with it. It is precisely these
relations which determine in what sphere of time (past, present, or future) a Semitic Perfect or
Imperfect lies, and by which of our tenses it is to be expressed – whether by our Past, Perfect,
Pluperfect, or Future-perfect; by our Present, Imperfect, or Future. The Arabian Grammarians
themselves have not, however, succeeded in keeping this important point distinctly in view, but
have given an undue importance to the idea of time” (1967, I:51).
6 The terms “perfect” and “imperfect” are sometimes misleading for English-speaking learners of
Arabic because they often compare the terms to European languages they have studied, such as
French, for example, where “imparfait” refers to a continuing state or action in the past. Note the
definition of “imperfect” in Webster’s Third (unabridged: 1986, q.v.): “of or relating to or being a
verb tense used to designate a continuing state or action esp. in the past” (my italics).

1.2.3 The present tense (the imperfect): al-muDaariﬁ´QÉ°†ŸG
1.2.3.1 FORM: The present tense is formed from the present tense stem of a verb,
to which both a prefix and a suffix are added. The stem by itself is not an
independent word; it needs the prefixes and suffixes to convey a complete
meaning. The prefixes are subject markers of person while the suffixes show
mood and number.7 In MSA, thirteen present tense inflectional forms are used.

The prefix and suffix together give the full meaning of the verb. They are some-
times referred to together as a “circumfix” because they surround the stem on
both sides.8
7 The term muDaariﬁliterally means ‘resembling.’ This term was adopted because of the fact that the
present tense mood markers on the verb (the suffixed Damma of the indicative and the fatHa of the
subjunctive) resemble the case markers on nouns (especially the nominative and accusative). In other
words, whereas the past tense verb has only one mood (the indicative) the present tense verb shifts its
mood depending on the syntactic context, just as a noun shifts its case depending on its role in the
sentence. The present tense therefore “resembles” a noun in this ability to shift its desinence.
8 The term “circumfix” refers to a combination of prefix and suffix used with a stem to create a
lexical item, such as the English word “enlighten.” As Anderson states, they “involve simultaneous
prefixation and suffixation that correspond to a single unit of morphological form” (1992, 53).
The discontinuous inflectional affixes on Arabic present tense verbs may be considered circum-
fixes, but the concept of circumfix as a separate morphological category is disputed. See Golston
1996, 731, esp. note 8, as well as Anderson 1992, 53, 59, and 389.

passive. The particle sa- is identified by some grammarians as an abbreviation of
sawfa.

Non-past action: Depending on the context, the Arabic past tense may also
be used to convey other meanings.12 For example:
.kÉÑjô≤J  Éæ∏°Uh
.∂«a ¬∏dG  ∑QÉH
waSal-naa taqriib-an. 
baarak-a llaah-u fii-ka.
We are almost there (lit. ‘we
God bless you (lit. ‘God has
have almost arrived’).
blessed you’).
1.3 Moods of the verb
Mood or “mode” refers to the Arabic verb properties indicative, subjunctive, jus-
sive, and imperative. These categories, or morphosyntactic properties, reflect
contextual modalities that condition the action of the verb. For example, the
indicative mood is characteristic of straightforward, factual statements or ques-
tions, while the subjunctive mood reflects an attitude toward the action such as
doubt, desire, intent, wishing, or necessity, and the jussive mood, when used for
the imperative, indicates an attitude of command, request, or need-for-action on
the part of the speaker. 
In Arabic, mood marking is done only on the present tense or imperfective stem;
there are no mood variants for the past tense. The Arabic moods are therefore non-
finite; that is, they do not refer to specific points in time and are not differentiated
by tense. Tense is inferred from context and other parts of the clause.13 For more
extensive description of the moods and their uses, see Chapters 34 and 35.
444
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
11 The second person plural masculine suffix -tum requires a long vowel -uu as a helping vowel before
a suffixed personal pronoun.
12 For example, the past tense is used in conditional sentences, as well as in optative (wishing)
expressions. For more on this function of the past tense, see Chapter 39.
13 The question of mood marking (on verbs) is a central one in Arabic grammar, along with case
marking (on nouns and adjectives). Moods fall under the topic of morphology because they are
reflected in Arabic word structure, that is, they are usually indicated by suffixes or modifications
of suffixes attached to the present tense verb stem, and the phonological nature of the verb stem
determines what form the suffix will take. Moods also, however, fall under the topic of syntax
because their use is determined either by particles which govern their occurrence, or by the narrative
context in general, including attitude of the speaker and intended meaning. They are therefore
referred to in some reference works and theoretical discussions as “morphosyntactic” categories.

1.4 Voice: active or passive
Whereas the tense of a verb conveys temporal or time-related information, the
“voice” of a verb conveys information on the topical focus of a sentence. The active
voice is used when the doer of the action is the subject of the verb (“I ate
the cake”), and the passive voice is used when the object of the verbal action is the
subject (“The cake was eaten.”).
Generally speaking, the passive voice is used in Arabic only if the agent or doer
of the action is unknown or not to be mentioned for some reason. This contrasts
with English where one may mention the agent in a passive construction through
use of the preposition “by” (“The cake was eaten by me.”) Rarely is the agent men-
tioned when the passive is used in Arabic.
The Arabic passive may be internal, through a change in the nature of the inter-
nal vowels (e.g., ﬁuqid-a ‘it was held’) or derivational (e.g., inﬁaqad-a ‘it was held’). 
For example, the following sentence is in the active voice:
.n´ÉªàL’G o∂∏ŸG nón≤nY
ﬁaqad-a l-malik-u l-ijitmaaﬁ-a.
The king held the meeting.

446
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
where al-malik-u ‘the king’ is the subject of the verb as well as the agent or doer of
the action, ﬁaqad-a, and the object of the verb is al- ijtimaaﬁ-a ‘the meeting.’
If the sentence were re-phrased as a passive construction, the object of the verb
becomes the subject of the sentence, and the verb is marked for passive. The inter-
nal morphological change that signals the Arabic passive is a change in the vowel
pattern of the verb:
.o´ÉªàL’G nóp≤oY
ﬁuqid-a l-ijtimaaﬁ-u.
The meeting was held.
where al-ijtimaaﬁ-u is now the subject, and the verb is inflected for passive voice
through the vowel sequence /-u-i-/ instead of /-a-a-/.
Another way of expressing the passive is to use another form of the verb which
is passive or reflexive in meaning, usually the Form VII verb, if it exists, or Form V:
.o´ÉªàL’G nón≤n©rfpG
inﬁaqad-a l-ijtimaaﬁ-u.
The meeting was held.
where the Form VII verb is active in form, but passive in meaning, and the subject
of the Form VII verb is al-ijtimaaﬁ-u. Passive and passive-like structures are
described at greater length in Chapter 38.
2 Complex predicates: compound verbs, qad, and verb strings
Arabic verbal expressions may consist of more than the main verb. Auxiliary verbs
may be used in conjunction with a main verb to express variations of tense and
aspect, and the verbal particle qad is also used to convey information about aspect. 
2.1 Compound verbs
Compound verbs are tenses that consist of the verb kaan-a plus a main verb. They
are as follows:
2.1.1 The past progressive
To convey the idea of continued or habitual action in the past, the verb kaan-a is
used in the past tense in conjunction with the present tense of the main verb.
Both parts of this compound verb are inflected for person, gender, and number.
The main verb always comes after kaan-a; if there is a specific subject mentioned,
it comes between the two parts of the verb.
This tense of the verb is used for expressing what in English would be “used to,”
or “was _____ ing.” Sometimes, with certain verbs in certain contexts it is used to

express a concept of an action that took place in the past, but extended or
endured over a period of time, rather than taking place at a discrete moment in
time. This is especially true of experiential verbs that denote states of mind, such
as knowing, feeling, liking. In those cases, the English equivalent is often just a
simple past tense.

They used to wake up daily at 6:00.
2.1.1.1 PAST PROGRESSIVE WITH EXPERIENTIAL VERBS: A state of knowing, feeling,
or understanding is one that is considered to extend over a period of time in the
past, and therefore such verbs are often expressed with the past continuous tense
rather than the simple past in Arabic. English does not usually express these
concepts with the past progressive tense, but with the simple past.

.IQÉ¨dÉH  ¿Éª∏©j  ÉfÉc
kaan-aa ya-ﬁlam-aani bi-l-ghaarat-i
They (two) knew about / had knowledge about the raid.
2.1.1.2 PAST PERFECT PROGRESSIVE MEANING WITH PRESENT TENSE AND mundhu:
When a state or action begins in the past and continues into the present, with
specific reference to the length of time that the state or action continued, the
present tense is used in Arabic although the past perfect progressive is used in
English. In equational sentences the present tense is expressed without a verb.
This meaning occurs most frequently with the particle mundh-u ‘since; for; ago.’
(See also Chapter 16, section 2.3.4.)

2.2 Pluperfect or past perfect: anteriority
To express an anterior action, i.e., an action in the past that is over with and
which serves as a background action for the present, the past tense of kaan-a is
used with a past tense of the main verb14. The particle qad may be optionally
inserted just before the main verb. Note that the subject of the verb, if mentioned
as a separate noun, goes between the auxiliary verb and the main verb. If the sub-
ject noun is human and plural, the main verb inflects for plural, although the
auxiliary verb remains singular because it precedes the subject.

He had accused them of provoking him.
.ájÉªM âÑ∏W øµJ  ⁄
lam ta-kun Talab-at Himaayat-an.
She had not requested protection.
2.3 Future perfect
To indicate a state or action expected to be completed in the future, the present
or future tense of kaan-a is used with a past tense main verb:
. . . ÉgQhO ‘ â∏°ûa  ¿ƒµà°ùa ,’EGh
wa-√illaa, fa-sa-ta-kuun-u fashil-at fii dawr-i-haa . . .
and if not, it will have failed in its role . . .
2.4 Unreal condition
To describe an action that would or could have taken place, but actually did not,
the past tense of kaan-a is used with the future tense of the main verb. This is
called an unreal condition or a contrary-to-fact condition.
.áHÉàµdGh  IAGô≤dG  ±ô©à°S  âfÉc  Ée

2.5 The particle qad
The particle qad is used with verbs. It has no exact lexical equivalent in English and
various theories have been put forth as to its function.15 One theory is that it is
used to emphasize or confirm aspect; that is, whether or not an action has been
completed, and to what degree. Used with the past (or “perfect”) tense, qad empha-
sizes and asserts that the action has indeed happened. In this context it may be
translated as ‘indeed,’ ‘already,’ or ‘really’ but sometimes it is not translatable.16
With the imperfect or present tense, it emphasizes the possibility of the action
or its potentiality rather than its actual achievement. In this case it is usually
translated as ‘may,’ ‘might,’ or ‘perhaps.’ 
Used in conjunction with the compound pluperfect tense verb (kaana qad ób ¿Éc),
it is part of the compound verb structure, coming after the auxiliary verb kaan-a and
before the past tense main verb.17 Rarely is qad used when the verb is negative.
As with other words that end in sukuun, qad needs a helping vowel kasra if it
occurs before a consonant cluster.
2.5.1 qad with past (perfect) tense
Used with the past tense, qad may occur on its own, but it may also be prefixed
with the particles wa- -nh, fa- `na or la- n`d. These particles do not change the meaning
of qad although they may imply a temporal sequence such as “and then.” Depend-
ing on context, the past tense verb with qad may be equivalent either to the sim-
ple past or to the past perfect. The use of qad here serves to confirm the meaning
of the past tense by emphasizing that the action did indeed happen. Sometimes
the insertion of the word “indeed” in English is appropriate.

15 See Bahloul 1996 for an in-depth analysis of the nature and uses of qad.
16 ﬁAbd al-Latif et al. (1997, 233) state that qad “is a particle of affirmation if it comes before a past
tense verb, and a particle of diminution if it comes before a present tense verb.” qad Harf-u taHqiiq-

auxiliary verb and the thematic verb” (Bahloul 1996, 37).

2.5.1.1 fa-qad + PAST TENSE: This conjunction introduces a clause in the past
tense that acts as circumstance or background to the previous clause, stating an
action or state that precedes the action in the previous clause chronologically or
logically.18 As Abboud and McCarus state (1983, part 1:537), “this construction
indicates a completed action whose results are still in effect” with regard to the
previous clause. This is considered a type of Haal or circumstantial structure.

2.6 Verb strings or serial verb constructions
Certain verbs can directly precede others, thereby modifying the meaning of the
main verb and acting as auxiliary verbs. Whenever the verb phrase consists of two
or more verbs, the subject, if mentioned, is usually put between them. These verbs
fall into several classes.
18Haywood and Nahmad state: “The particle qad is sometimes used before the Perfect verb. It is a
confirmatory particle, which may make the verb definitely Past perfect . . . However, this particle
may also make the verb Pluperfect . . . according to context” (1962, 100).

2.6.1 Verbs of appropinquation
These verbs indicate proximity or nearness to an action, but not quite the achieve-
ment of it, referred to by Wright as verbs of “appropinquation” (1967, II:106).19 These
include verbs such as kaad-a/ya-kaad-u ‘to almost [do something]; be on the point of
[doing something]’ and √awshak-a yuushik-u ‘to be on the verge’ of doing something.

starting or setting about an action and are usually used in the past with a present
tense main verb. In MSA these verbs include:

Certain concepts are conveyed by verbs describing simultaneous states or actions.
The subject may remain the same for both verbs, or it may be different. This struc-
ture is a form of Haal, or adverbial expression that describes what someone was
doing at the time of the action of the main verb.20

section 5.3.3.3.

1 Basic characteristics
1.1 Pattern
Form I is considered the base form because of its fundamental structure. In
Arabic, this form is termed mujarrad Osônéoe: ‘bare; stripped’ because it is the
simplest stem of all. The base pattern for Form I past tense is CaCVC, that is,
consonant-fatHa-consonant-short vowel-consonant. Although the first short vowel
is consistently fatHa, the second, or stem vowel, may be fatHa, kasra or Damma:
faﬁal-a nπn©na, faﬁil-a nπp©na, faﬁul-a nπo©na.
The present tense stem vowel (the vowel that follows the second root consonant)
is also variable in Form I. It may be /a/, /u/, or /i/.
1.2 Meaning
Form I is the closest indicator of the meaning of the lexical root. There are shades
of meaning associated with the stem vowel differences in the past tense citation
forms, but these semantic differences are very subtle. Note that every verb and
verbal noun has a range of meanings, sometimes extensive. Glosses or English
equivalents provided here are not exclusive or exact meanings but represent com-
mon standard usage.
1.3 Transitivity
Form I covers a wide semantic range and may be either intransitive or transitive.
Occasionally it is doubly transitive.
1.4 Inﬂection
A particular inflectional characteristic of Form I verbs is that the present tense
subject-marker vowel is fatHa (e.g., ya-drus-u, ya-wadd-u, ya-ﬁnii).
1.5 Root types
The nature of the three root consonants determines the root type. Phonological
and morphophonemic rules apply to various kinds of sound and irregular roots,

as follows.1 Paradigm charts for all Form I root types are located at the end of this
chapter.
2 Regular (sound) triliteral root (al-ﬁﬁl al-SaHiiH al-saalim ⁄É°ùdG í«ë°üdG π©ØdG)
Sound or regular verbal roots consist of three consonants, all of which are differ-
ent and none of which are waaw, yaa√, or hamza. The Form I verbs are presented
here by their stem types, which fall into three groups.2
2.1 Past tense stem vowel is fatHa
When the past tense stem vowel is fatHa, the present tense stem vowel may be /a/,
/u/, or /i/, so there are three subgroups within this class. Occasionally, the present
tense may show two different stem vowels.
2.1.1 faﬁal-a/ ya-fﬁal-u
Here fatHa is the stem vowel in both the past and present tenses. There is some
indication that the present tense medial vowel in this verb form is conditioned by
the nature of its contiguous consonants, which would be the second and third
root consonants. The general theory is that a fatHa in the present tense is associ-
ated with a back (pharyngeal or glottal) consonant.3

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
1 Traditional Arabic grammar divides verb roots into two major classes: (1) SaHiiH í«ë°U ‘sound’
and (2) muﬁtall qπà©e ‘weak.’ Sound roots are ones that do not contain either waaw or yaa√; weak
roots contain waaw or yaa√as one or more of the root phonemes. In this text, I have allotted
separate categories for doubled and hamzated verbs because they sometimes involve stem changes
when inflected, even though they are considered SaHiiH, or ‘sound,’ in Arabic grammatical terms.
2 Certain roots may have more than one stem in the past. Sometimes this indicates a meaning
difference, sometimes not. For example, shamal-a/ya-shmal-u ‘to contain, include’ and also shamil-a/
ya-shmal-u with the same meaning.
3 For more analysis of the Form I stem-vowel alternation see McCarthy 1991, esp. pp. 69–70, and see
also McOmber 1995, 178–85.

states of being, or the acquisition or increase of a certain quality. These roots therefore
also are the roots of many adjectives. This type of Form I verb is usually intransitive.

3 Geminate verb root (al-ﬁﬁl al-muDaﬁﬁaf ∞q©°†ŸG π©ØdG)
4
Geminate or doubled verbal roots are ones where the second and third consonant
of the root are the same. In the citation form of Form I, the doubled or geminate
consonant is written only once, with a shadda above it to show that it is double.
3.1 Stem shifts
Geminate verbs have two stems in the past and also two in the present. This is
because of a phonological rule that prevents two identical consonants from being
in sequence with a short vowel between them when they are directly followed by
a vowel, e.g., instead of *radad-a it is radd-a (‘he replied’), instead of *ya-HTuT-uuna,
it is ya-HuTT-uuna (‘they put’).
However, if the second identical stem consonant is followed by another con-
sonant, the identical consonants remain separated, e.g., radad-tu (‘I replied’), 
ya-HTuT-na (‘they (f.) put’).5 This second type of stem, where the identical conso-
nants are split, is referred to here as the “split stem.”
In the past tense conjugation, many of the inflectional suffixes start with con-
sonants (-tu, -ta, -ti, -tumaa, -naa, -tunna, -tum, -na), so the split stem in the past tense
is fairly common; in the present tense, however, the only suffix that starts with a
consonant is the -na of the second and third persons feminine plural (e.g., ya-rdud-na
‘they (f.) reply’).
3.2 Stem types
Doubled Form I verbs fall into three stem types, according to their stem vowels.
The citation forms of the past tense third person singular all look alike, so in
order to know the stem type, it is necessary to know the stem vowel in the present
tense. The first person singular past tense and the third person feminine plural
present tense are given as examples for these verbs to illustrate the stem vowels.

4 Hamzated verb root (al-ﬁﬁl al-mahmuuz Rƒª¡ŸG π©ØdG)
A hamzated verb is one where any one of the root consonants is hamza. It may
occur as the first, second, or third consonant. These verbs are considered a sepa-
rate category because of rules that govern the occurrence and distribution of
hamza, and also because of hamza spelling rules. As the verbal roots inflect within
conjugations or as they shift into derived forms, the seat of hamza may change.

5 Assimilated verb root (al-ﬁﬁl al-mithaal ∫ÉãŸG π©ØdG)
Assimilated verb roots begin with a semi-consonant (waaw or yaa√), most often
waaw. They are called assimilated in English because the initial waaw, even though
it is part of the root, often disappears in the present tense, deleted or assimilated
to the subject-marker prefix. The yaa√does not normally get assimilated.7
5.1 First root consonant deleted in present tense
This group consists of a number of frequently occurring verbs in MSA. They fall
into two groups: those with fatHa in the past tense stem and kasra in the present
tense, and those with fatHa as the stem vowel in both tenses.

6 Hollow root (al-ﬁﬁl al-√ajwaf ±ƒLC’G π©ØdG)
Hollow verbs are ones in which the second root consonant is actually a semi-
consonant: either waaw or yaa√. These two semi-consonants undergo various muta-
tions, turning into √alif, a short vowel, or a long vowel depending on the word
structure and derivation. In the past tense citation form, for example, the waaw or
yaa√is not present and is replaced by √alif. However, to look up one of these words
Form I: The base form triliteral verb
461
8 This verb is geminate as well as assimilated. Phonotactic rules prevent the initial waaw from
becoming assimilated in this case.
9 Also ya-sur-a/ya-ysur-u ‘to be small; to be easy.’
10 Also ya-quZ-a/ya-yquZ-u.

in a dictionary, one must know what the medial root consonant is, either waaw or
yaa√. The medial root consonant often shows itself in the present tense verb stem
(as a long or short vowel) and elsewhere, as in the verbal nouns or participles.
There are essentially three variations on the hollow verb root, determined by
which long vowel is in the present tense or imperfective stem: waaw, yaa√, or √alif.
6.1 Hollow-waaw
These verbs have waaw as their medial radical. The stem vowel in the past tense is
√alif when it is long and Damma when it is short. Examples of both stems are given.
The first person singular is used to exemplify the short stem. The stem vowel in
the present tense is waaw when long and Damma when short. The third person
feminine plural is used to exemplify the short stem.

(n¿rQoõnj) oQhõnj / (oärQoR) nQGR 
6.2 Hollow yaa√
These verbs have yaa√as the medial radical. The stem vowel in the past tense is √alif
when it is long and kasra when it is short. Examples of both stems are given. The
first person singular is used to exemplify the short stem. The stem vowel in the
present tense is yaa√when long and kasra when short. The third person feminine
plural is used to exemplify the short stem.
to live

to sell
baaﬁ-a (biﬁ-tu)/ya-biiﬁ-u (ya-biﬁ-na)
(nør©pÑnj) o™«Ñnj / (oâr©pH) n´ÉH
6.3 Hollow √alif
These verb roots have either medial waaw or yaa√but do not show it in the present
tense, using √alif instead. The stem vowel in the past tense is √alif when it is long
and kasra when it is short. Examples of both stems are given. The first person sin-
gular is used to exemplify the short stem. The stem vowel in the present tense is
√alif when long and fatHa when short. The third person feminine plural is used to
exemplify the short stem.

7 Defective verb root (al-ﬁﬁl al-naaqiS ¢übÉædG π©ØdG)
Defective verb roots are ones where the final consonant is either waaw or yaa√.
These final semi-consonants may take on various forms and even seem to disap-
pear under certain circumstances. In the past tense citation form, these roots all
have final √alif. Roots where yaa√is the final consonant appear with √alif maqSuura
or yaa√; roots where waaw is the final consonant are written with √alif Tawiila.11

7.2 yaa√defective roots
Yaa√defective Form I verbs fall into two main categories: ones that end in -aa (√alif
maqSuura) and ones that end with yaa√. The ones ending in -aa usually inflect in
the present tense with -ii; the ones that end with yaa√in the past tense usually
take -aa in the present tense. A few verbs take -aa in both the past and the present.

8 Doubly weak or “mixed” verb root
Doubly weak verb roots have semi-consonants and/or hamza in two places, some-
times as the first and third consonants, and sometimes as the second and third.

9 Verbal nouns of Form I
Form I verbal nouns have many variations of pattern.12 Wright lists forty-four pos-
sible verbal noun patterns for Form I or as he terms it, “the ground form” of the
ordinary triliteral verb (1967, I:110–112); Ziadeh and Winder (1957, 71–72) list
eighteen of the most commonly used ones in MSA. ﬁAbd al-Latif, ﬁUmar and
Zahran give an extensive list (in Arabic) with examples and some explanations
(1997, 83–86). To some extent, particular verbal noun patterns may be associated
with particular Form I verb stem types. For a discussion of this, see Blachère and
Demombynes 1975, 78–84. See also Bateson 2003, 15–21 for a general discussion of
Arabic noun derivation. The most common forms of Form I verbal nouns are listed
here by root type. Sometimes the meaning of the verbal noun is abstract and
sometimes it has acquired a specific, concrete denotation.
Note that many verbs have more than one verbal noun. In this case, the nouns
usually have different connotations. Owing to space restrictions, I have not listed
all verbal noun options for Form I, only typical examples.

unpredictable word-patterns, and constitute lexical items.” ﬁAbd al-Latif, ﬁUmar and Zahran
declare that “The verbal nouns of the base form are many and varied and cannot be known except
by resorting to language [reference] books” maSaadir-u l-thulaathiyy-i kathiirat-un wa-mutanawwaﬁ-
at-un laa tuﬁ-raf-u √illaa bi-l-rujuuﬁ-i √ilaa kutub-i l-lughat-i (1997, 83).

13 The phonological sequence /-iw-/ is usually avoided in Arabic. Therefore hypothetical forms like
*ziwaara and *qiwaam shift to become ziyaara ‘visit’ or qiyaam ‘establishing.’

10 Form I participles
10.1 Form I active participle (AP): faaﬁil πYÉa
APs that refer to living beings take the natural gender of the referent; APs that
refer to non-living things may be either masculine or feminine. For more detail on
AP morphology and syntax see Chapter 6 on participles. Examples are provided
here of how the various root types fit into the pattern. The items are categorized
as either noun or adjective, but many have both noun and adjective functions.

Assimilated roots are regular in Form I active participle formation.
Noun:
mother
waalida/-aat
äGópdGh / InópdGh
import/s
waarid/-aat
äGOpQGh / OpQGh
14 The plural mawaadd is the form that the plural pattern fawaaﬁil takes in geminate nouns because
of the phonological restriction on sequences that include a vowel between identical consonants.
*mawaadid –> mawaadd. It is diptote (CaCaaCiC pattern).
15 From the hamzated root √-x-r; the initial hamza followed by the long /aa/ of the faaﬁil pattern creates
/√aa/, spelled with √alif madda.

10.1.6 Defective root: faaﬁ-in m´Éa
The defective root shows its weakness in the AP form by having its final waaw or
yaa√in the form of kasrataan on the base masculine form, putting it into the
defective declension. In feminine APs the weakness is regularized into an /-iya /
ending.

‘to intend’

1 Basic characteristics
1.1 Pattern: faﬁﬁal-a nπs©na / yu-faﬁﬁil-u oπu©nØoj
Form II verbs are augmented with respect to Form I in that the medial consonant
is doubled. They have the stem patterns C1aC2C2aC3- in the past tense and yu-
C1aC2C2iC3- in the present. The medial root consonant retains its doubled status
throughout the past and present tense conjugations.
1.2 Meaning
Form II verbs are often causative of transitive Form I verbs, or, if Form I is intran-
sitive, Form II may have transitive meaning. Another shade of meaning that is
said to be conveyed by Form II is intensive or repeated action (kassar-a ‘to smash,
to shatter’). Form II may also be denominative, used to form verbs out of nouns
(e.g., Sawwar-a ‘to photograph’ from Suura, ‘picture’).1
1.3 Transitivity
Form II is normally transitive but may sometimes be intransitive.2 It may also be
doubly transitive, taking two direct objects (e.g., darras-a ‘to teach (s.o. s.th.)’).
1.4 Inﬂection
A particular inflectional characteristic of Form II verbs is that the present tense sub-
ject-marker vowel is Damma and the present tense stem vowel is kasra (yu-darris-u).
491
23
Form II
1 In Arabic, the verb is usually considered the most elemental form of a lexical entry, but in a few
instances, the verb is derived from a noun. These “denominal” verbs tend to exist in Forms II and V
and rarely in other forms. They can be triliteral or quadriliteral. Denominal verbs rarely have a
Form I. Some examples of Form II denominal verbs include:
to unite
waHHad-a/yu-waHHid-u óqMƒj / óqMh (from ‘one’ waaHid óMGh)
to head
ra√√as-a/yu-ra√√is-u ¢ùqFôj / ¢SqCGQ (from ‘head’ ra√s ¢SCGQ)
to name
sammaa/yu-sammii »qª°ùj / ≈qª°S (from ‘name’ ism º°SG)
2 Kouloughli 1994, 201 states that Form II is transitive 95 percent of the time. Likewise he states that
Form II is “l’une des plus vivaces de l’arabe moderne” (ibid.).

Paradigm charts for Form II verbs of various root types are located at the end of
this chapter.
2 Regular (sound) triliteral root
These are examples of verbs that have sound triliteral roots:
to prefer
faDDal-a/yu-faDDil-u
oπu°†nØoj / nπs°†na
to arrange
rattab-a/yu-rattib-u
oÖuJnôoj / nÖsJnQ
to clean
naZZaf-a/yu-naZZif-u
o∞u¶næoj / n∞s¶nf
to appreciate
qaddar-a/yu-qaddir-u
oQuón≤oj / nQsónb
3 Geminate (doubled) root Form II
Geminate roots in Form II have the following stem patterns: C1aC2C2aC2- in the
past tense and yuC1aC2C2iC2- in the present. The doubling of the medial conso-
nant changes the geminate root in Form II so that it inflects as a regular Form II,
that is, there is no stem shift as there is in Form I geminates. For example:
to cause
sabbab-a/yu-sabbib-u
oÖuÑn°ùoj / nÖsÑn°S
to decide, determine
qarrar-a/ yu-qarrir-u
oQuôn≤oj / nQsônb
to criticize
naddad-a/yu-naddid-u
oOuónæoj / nOsónf
to analyze
Hallal-a/yu-Hallil-u
oπu∏nëoj / nπs∏nM
4 Hamzated roots in Form II
A hamza may occur in the first, second, or third position in the triliteral root.
Depending on its position, and the surrounding vowels, the hamza may have to
change its “seat” when the verb inflects for person and tense in Form II.
4.1 Initial hamza
Hamza-initial verbs in Form II have √alif as the hamza seat in the past tense, and
waaw as the hamza seat in the present tense. The hamza seat is determined by its
position in the word, according to the orthographical rules for hamza described in
Chapter 2, section 3.3. In Form II verbs, initial hamza shifts from word-initial posi-
tion in the past tense stem to word-medial position in the present tense stem and
is influenced by the Damma of the present tense subject-marking prefix so that its
seat shifts from √alif to waaw.
to delay 
√ajjal-a/yu-√ajjil-u

to establish, found
√assas-a/yu-√assis-u
o¢ùp°qnSnDƒoj / ¢ùs°SnCG

√akkad-a/yu-√akkid-u
oóucnDƒoj / nóscnCG
to affect
√aththar-a/yu-√aththir-u
oôuKnDƒoj / nôsKnCG 
492
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

4.2 Medial hamza
The seat for medial hamza shifts from √alif in the past tense to yaa√in the present
tense (because of the shift of stem vowel from fatHa to kasra).
to appoint as head
ra√√as-a/ yu-ra√√is-u
o¢ùuFnôoj / n¢SsCGnQ
4.3 Final hamza
The seat for final hamza in Form II, as in other forms, shifts according to the rules
for word-final hamza; note that certain inflectional suffixes extend the word
length, and therefore the seat for hamza is affected (e.g., hanna√-uu-haa ÉghDƒqæg
‘they congratulated her’).
to free
barra√-a/yu-barri√-u
oÇuônÑoj / nCGqnônH
to congratulate
hanna√-a/yu-hanni√-u
oÅuæn¡oj / nCÉsæng
to hide
xabba√-a/yu-xabbi√-u
oÅuÑnîoj / nCÉsÑnN
to heat, warm
daffa√-a/yu-daffi√-u
oÅuanóoj / nCÉsanO
5 Assimilated roots in Form II
Assimilated roots, where the first radical is either waaw or yaa√, are inflected as
sound roots in Form II; the waaw or yaa√remains stable in both tenses.
to sign, endorse
waqqaﬁ-a/yu-waqqiﬁ-u
o™ubnƒoj / n™sbnh
to stop, halt
waqqaf-a/yu-waqqif-u
o∞ubnƒoj / n∞sbnh
6 Hollow roots in Form II
Hollow roots behave as sound roots in Form II, the waaw or yaa√that is the second
radical functions as a stable consonant.
to create 
kawwan-a/yu-kawwin-u
o¿uƒnµoj / n¿sƒnc
to change
ghayyar-a/yu-ghayyir-u
oôu«n¨oj / nôs«nZ
to photograph
Sawwar-a/yu-Sawwir-u
oQuƒn°üoj / nQsƒn°U
to appoint 
ﬁayyan-a/yu-ﬁayyin-u
oøu«n©oj / nøs«nY
7 Defective roots in Form II
Defective roots, where the final radical is either waaw or yaa√, behave as -aa/-ii
verbs in Form II. They depend on the stem vowel for the nature of the final rad-
ical, and the stem vowel is consistently /a/ in the past tense and /i/ in the present
tense.

1 Basic characteristics
1.1 Pattern: faaﬁal-a nπnYÉa/ yu-faaﬁil-u oπpYÉØoj
Form III is augmented from Form I by insertion of the long vowel /aa/ after the
first radical of the root. It has the basic stem patterns C1aaC2aC3- in the past tense
and -C1aaC2iC3- in the present tense, maintaining the long vowel in both tenses.
1.2 Meaning
In terms of meaning, Form III often has the meaning of involving another person
in the action. For this reason it is termed “associative.” Related semantic modifi-
cations conveyed by this inflectional class include reciprocal action, repeated
action, and attempted action.1
1.3 Transitivity
Form III verbs are usually transitive, but may occasionally be intransitive.
1.4 Inﬂection
A distinctive inflectional characteristic of Form III verbs is that the present tense
subject-marker vowel is Damma and the present tense stem vowel is kasra (yu-
saaﬁid-u).
2 Regular (sound) triliteral root
These verbs are examples of Form III sound triliteral roots:
to experience
maaras-a/yu-maaris-u
o¢SpQÉªoj / n¢SnQÉe
to defend
daafaﬁ-a/yu-daafiﬁ-u
o™paGóoj / n™naGO
to assist, help
saaﬁad-a/yu-saaﬁid-u
oópYÉ°ùoj / nónYÉ°S
to observe
raaqab-a/yu-raaqib-u
oÖpbGôoj / nÖnbGQ
503
24
Form III triliteral verb
1 For an extensive analysis of Form III and its semantic implications, see Fleisch 1979, II:288–301.

2.1 Associative meaning
Arabic Form III associative verbal concepts are often directly transitive whereas
English would need to use the word “with” to indicate reciprocality or associa-
tiveness:
to correspond with (s.o.)
raasal-a/yu-raasil-u
oπp°SGôoj / nπn°SGQ
to share with (s.o.)
shaarak-a/yu-shaarik-u
o∑pQÉ°ûoj / n∑nQÉ°T
to deal with (s.o., s.th.)
ﬁaalaj-a/yu-ﬁaalij-u
oèpdÉ©oj / nèndÉY
to compete with (s.o.)
saabaq-a/yu-saabiq-u
o≥pHÉ°ùoj / n≥nHÉ°S
3 Geminate (doubled) root Form III
It is rare to find geminate roots in Form III. The ones that do exist have two variant
patterns: one where the identical consonants are written together with a shadda
and one where they are written separately, with an intervening fatHa. The follow-
ing stem patterns occur: C1aaC2C2-a ( faaﬁﬁ-) and C1aaC2aC2-a ( faaﬁaﬁ-) in the past
tense, and yu-C1aaC2C2 - (yu-faaﬁﬁ- or yu-C1aaC2iC2 - (yu-faaﬁiﬁ-) in the present.2
to punish
qaaSaS-a/yu-qaaSiS-u
o¢üp°UÉ≤oj / n¢ün°UÉb
4 Hamzated roots in Form III
The hamza may occur in the first, second, or third position in the triliteral root.
Depending on its position, and the surrounding vowels, the hamza may have to
change its seat when the verb inflects for person and tense.
4.1 Initial hamza
In Form III, initial hamza merges with the long vowel -aa of the first syllable in the
past tense and it written as one √alif with madda. In the present tense, initial
hamza sits on a waaw seat because it is preceded by the Damma of the person-
marking prefix:
to censure, to blame
√aaxadh-a/yu-√aaxidh-u
oòpNGDƒoj / nònNBG
to consult
√aamar-a/yu-√aamir-u
oôpeGDƒoj / nôneBG
4.2 Medial hamza
The medial hamza sits aloof in the past tense of Form III.3 In the present tense it
sits on a yaa√seat because it is followed by a kasra.
504
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
2 See Wright 1967, I:71 for further discussion of this variation.
3 This is because it is situated after a long vowel /aa/ and before a short vowel /a/. It would have an
√alif seat, but the general rule is that two √alifs cannot follow each other in Arabic script, so the
hamza here floats aloof.

to match; to be suitable for
laa√am-a/yu-laa√im-u
oºpFÓoj / nΩnA’
to question, interrogate
saa√al-a/yu-saa√il-u
oπpFÉ°ùoj / n∫nAÉ°S
4.3 Final hamza
Final hamza sits on an √alif seat in the past tense and on a yaa√seat in the present
tense, but because it is the final consonant in the stem, the seat of the hamza may
shift with inflectional suffixes.
to surprise
faaja√-a/yu-faaji√-u
oÅpLÉØoj / nCÉnLÉa
to reward; to be
kaafa√-a/yu-kaafi√-u
oÅpaÉµoj / nCÉnaÉc

5 Assimilated roots in Form III
Assimilated roots, where the first radical is either waaw or yaa√, are inflected as
sound roots in Form III; the waaw or yaa√is stable.
to agree with
waafaq-a/yu-waafiq-u
o≥paGƒoj / n≥naGh
to face, confront 
waajah-a/yu-waajih-u
o¬pLGƒoj / n¬nLGh
6 Hollow roots in Form III
Hollow roots behave as strong roots in Form III, the waaw or yaa√that is the second
radical functions as a consonant.
to answer
jaawab-a/yu-jaawib-u
oÜphÉéoj  / nÜnhÉL
to try, attempt
Haawal-a/yu-Haawil-u
o∫phÉëoj / n∫nhÉM

shaawar-a/yu-shaawir-u
oQphÉ°ûoj / nQnhÉ°T
to be gentle with
laayan-a/yu-laayin-u
oøpjÓoj / nønj’
7 Defective roots in Form III
Defective roots, where the final radical is either waaw or yaa√, behave as -aa/-ii
verbs in Form III. They depend on the stem vowel for the nature of the final radi-
cal, and the stem vowel is consistently /a/ in the past tense and /i/ in the present
tense.
to call; summon; invite
naadaa/yu-naadii
…OÉæoj / iOÉf

10 Form III verbal noun
The verbal noun of Form III verbs takes two basic forms: mufaaﬁala and fiﬁaal.
Usually, one of these verbal nouns is used for a particular Form III verb, but
occasionally, a verb may use both of these Form III verbal nouns, with either
equivalent or slightly different meanings. For example:
Form: Form III Haawar-a ‘talk, debate, argue’
argument,
muHaawara
InQnhÉëoe
conversation,
Hiwaar
QGƒpM
dispute
dialogue
Form: Form III kaafaH-a ‘to combat, fight, struggle’
confrontation,
mukaafaHa
ánënaÉµoe
fight, battle,
kifaaH
ìÉØpc
battle
strife
For the most part, however, one of these two verbal nouns suffices for a Form III
verb. Both of these verbal noun patterns take the sound feminine plural.

1 Basic characteristics
1.1 Pattern: √afﬁal-a nπn©ranCG / yu-fﬁil-u oπp©rØoj
Form IV is augmented from Form I by the prefixing of hamza plus fatHa on the past
tense stem. It has the stem pattern √aC1C2aC3- in the past tense and the stem pat-
tern yu-C1aC2iC3- in the present tense. 
1.2 Meaning
Form IV verbs are often causative of Form I. If the Form I verb is intransitive, Form
IV is transitive; if the Form I verb is transitive, Form IV may be doubly transitive,
taking two objects. Form IV verbs may have meanings similar to Form II verbs. For
example, xabbar-a and √axbar-a, both mean ‘to inform’; waqqaf-a and √awqaf-a both
mean ‘to halt, to stop.’ Sometimes the meanings of Form II and Form IV verbs are
close but not exactly the same. For example, ﬁallam-a means ‘to teach’ whereas
√aﬁlam-a means ‘to inform.’1
1.3 Transitivity
Form IV verbs are usually transitive and sometimes doubly transitive.2 Intransitive
Form IV is rare.3
A doubly transitive Form IV verb may take two objects. It often has the option of
marking the indirect object (or beneficiary) with a dative-marking preposition
such as li-.4

Form IV triliteral verb
1 Sterling 1904, 51–53 lists four other less common semantic modifications of Form IV: “finding
[estimative],” “change,” “motion to,” and “to be in season,” with examples from Classical Arabic.
Wright 1967, I:34–36 gives also a denominative meaning for Form IV.
2 Kouloughli 1994, 203 estimates 80 percent of Form IV verbs are transitive.
3 One example is: “to grow dark” √aZlam-a/yu-Zlim-u oºp∏¶oj / nºn∏rXnCG.
4 For more on double accusatives and use of dative-marking prepositions, see Chapter 4, section 2.5.

1.4 Inﬂection
Inflectional characteristics of Form IV verbs include:
(1)
the present tense subject-marker vowel is Damma and the present tense
stem vowel is kasra (√akmal-a/yu-kmil-u).
(2)
the prefixed hamza plus fatHa in the past tense disappears in the present
tense, replaced by the subject markers.5
(3)
the prefixed hamza in the past tense is stable (hamzat al-qaTﬁ) and is not
deleted when pronounced after a vowel.
2 Regular (sound) triliteral root: √afﬁal-a nπn©ranCG / yu-fﬁil-u oπp©rØoj
These verbs are examples of Form IV sound triliteral roots:
to include, insert 
√adraj-a/yu-drij-u
oêpQróoj / nênQrOnCG
to disturb, bother 
√azﬁaj-a/yu-zﬁij-u
oèpYrõoj / nènYrRnCG
to announce  
√aﬁlan-a/yu-ﬁlin-u
oøp∏r©oj / nøn∏rYnCG
to supervise 
√ashraf-a/yu-shrif-u
o±pôr°ûoj / n±nôr°TnCG  
to send 
√arsal-a/yu-rsil-u
oπp°Srôoj / nπn°SrQnCG
to please  
√aﬁjab-a/yu-ﬁjib-u
oÖpér©oj / nÖnérYnCG
3 Geminate (doubled) root Form IV: √afaﬁﬁ-a s™nanCG / yu-fﬁﬁ-i q™pØoj
The geminate root in Form IV behaves very much as Form I geminates. The gemi-
nate or doubled consonant is doubled and written with shadda when followed by
a vowel suffix and it separates into two separate consonants when followed by a
suffix that begins with a consonant.

√aHass-a/yu-Hiss-u

√aﬁadd-a/yu-ﬁidd-u

516
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
5 This has the effect of making unvoweled Form IV verbs resemble Form I verbs in written Arabic.
For verbs which exist in both forms (for example, Sadar-a/ ya-Sdur-u oQoór°ünj / nQnón°U ‘to emanate, come
out’ and √aSdar-a/yu-Sdir-u oQpór°üoj/ nQnór°UnCG ‘to publish’), context is used to disambiguate form as well
as meaning.

4 Hamzated roots in Form IV
4.1 Initial hamza
In Form IV, initial root hamza merges with the prefix hamza in the past tense and
they are written as one √alif with a madda over it. In the present tense, initial
hamza sits on a waaw seat because it is preceded by the Damma of the person-
marking prefix:
to believe, have faith
√aaman-a/yu-√min-u
oøperDƒoj / nøneBG
to rent out, to lease
√aajar-a/yu-√jir-u
oôpLrDƒoj / nônLBG
4.2 Medial hamza
The medial hamza sits on an √alif seat in the past tense. In the present tense it sits
on a yaa√seat because it is followed by a kasra.
to comply with someone’s request
√as√al-a/yu-s√il-u
oπpÄr°ùoj / n∫nCÉr°SnCG
4.3 Final hamza
Final hamza may sit on an √alif seat in the past tense, but because it is the final con-
sonant in the stem, the seat of hamza may shift with certain suffixes:
to set up, establish 
√ansha√-a / yu-nshi√-u
oÅp°ûræoj / nCÉn°ûrfnCG
to extinguish 
√aTfa√-a/yu-Tfi√-u
oÅpØr£oj / nCÉnØrWnCG
5 Assimilated roots in Form IV: √afﬁal-a nπn©ranCG / yuu-ﬁil-u oπpYƒj 
In the past tense of Form IV, the initial waaw or yaa√of the assimilated root
behaves as a regular consonant. In the present tense, however, it assimilates to the
vowel /u/ of the subject-marking prefix and becomes long /uu/.
to explain, clarify 
√awDaH-a/yuuDiH-u
oíp°Vƒj / nín°VrhnCG
to halt, stop 
√awqaf-a/yuuqif-u
o∞pbƒj / n∞nbrhnCG
to awaken 
√ayqaZ-a/yuuqiZ-u
oßpbƒj / nßn≤rjnCG
to bring, convey 
√awSal-a/yuuSil-u
oπp°Uƒj / nπn°UrhnCG
‘to cause to arrive’
6 Hollow roots in Form IV: √afaal-a/ yu-ﬁil-u  oπjaoj/nπÉanDG
The semi-consonants waaw and yaa√of hollow roots in Form IV show up as √alif
(long stem) and fatHa (short stem) in the past tense and yaa√and kasra in the pres-
ent tense stem. The pattern is √afaal-a/ yu-fiil-u. Examples of both stems are given

in both tenses: in addition to the standard citation form of third person mascu-
line singular, first person singular (in the past), and third person feminine plural
(in the present).

7 Defective roots in Form IV: √afﬁaa ≈©ranCG / yu-fﬁii »©rØoj 
Defective roots, where the final radical is either waaw or yaa√, behave as -aa/-ii verbs
in Form IV. They depend on the stem vowel for the nature of the final radical, and
the stem vowel is consistently /a/ in the past tense and /i/ in the present tense.

at a certain quality or characteristic of something or someone. It is followed by a
noun in the accusative, or a pronoun suffix that denotes the possessor of the qual-
ity. The occurrence of this construction in media Arabic is rare, but it is found in
literary contexts. 
The verbs used in this type of construction are usually related to adjectival roots
and are sometimes referred to as “adjectival verbs.”8 They are also termed “verbs
of surprise or admiration” (Cowan 1964, 177). Cantarino describes the word fol-
lowing maa as “an elative in the accusative of exclamation” (1974–76, II:210), that
is, as a comparative adjective. See also in this book Chapter 7, section 5.3.3.12 on
“less frequent accusatives.”

1 Basic characteristics
1.1 Pattern: tafaﬁﬁal-a nπs©nØnJ/ya-tafaﬁﬁal-u oπs©nØnànj
Form V verbs are augmented with respect to Form I in that the medial consonant
of the triliteral root is doubled (as in Form II) and a prefix ta- is added to the stem.1
In the present tense, the subject-marking prefix vowel is fatHa and the two stem
vowels are fatHa. Form V verbs thus have the stem patterns taC1aC2C2aC3- in the
past tense and ya-taC1aC2C2aC3- in the present.2
1.2 Meaning
In many cases Form V is the reflexive of the Form II verb, meaning that the action
expressed in Form II is done to or happens to one’s self. This is sometimes referred
to by grammarians as mediopassive.3 Form V may also be resultative of Form II,
showing the result of the Form II action, e.g., kassar-tu-haa fa-takassar-at ‘I broke it
(Form II) and it broke (Form V).’4 Other semantic modifications embodied in this
form include gradual progress in an activity or state (e.g., taHassan-a ‘to improve,’
tadaxxal-a ‘to meddle, to interfere,’ tamazzaq-a ‘to be ripped apart, fragmented’)
and acquisition or imitation of a quality (e.g., ta√assaf-a ‘to be or act sorry’;
ta√addab-a ‘to behave courteously’).
26
Form V triliteral verb
1 The prefixed ta-, used as a derivational affix is often characterized as a marker of reflexive action
or even of the passive. “Its main derivational function is that of the passive” (Cowell 1964, 85).
In more recent studies of this form, it is said often to represent “unaccusative” constructions in
Arabic. See Mahmoud 1991 for further discussion of both Form V and Form VII as Arabic counterparts
for unaccusative structures.
2 Note that in the present tense, there is both an inflectional prefix (the subject marker) and a
derivational prefix (the ta- of Form V).
3 “No grammatical distinction is made in Arabic verbs between ‘reflexive’ acts and spontaneous
developments – what one does to one’s self and what simply happens to one are equally
accommodated by the mediopassive” (Cowell 1964, 238).
4 The Arabic term used to refer to the resultative meaning of derived forms (especially V, VII, and
VIII) is muTaawaﬁa áYhÉ£e ‘obedience, conformity’ or muTaawiﬁ´hÉ£e ‘obedient, conforming’ –
that is, conforming with a particular, lexically related action. Fleisch 1979 states (II:305) “Ce
muTaawiﬁexprime l’état dans lequel se trouve un sujet, sous l’action . . . [d’un verbe] précédente.”

1.3 Transitivity
Form V verbs are often reflexive or intransitive, but they may be transitive as well.
1.4 Inﬂection
Inflectional characteristics of Form V verbs:
The present tense subject-marker vowel is fatHa and the present tense stem
vowel is fatHa (taqaddam-a/ya-taqaddam-u).
2 Regular (sound) triliteral root
These verbs are examples of Form V sound triliteral roots:
to breathe
tanaffas-a/ya-tanaffas-u
o¢ùsØnænànj / n¢ùsØnænJ
to move, be in motion
taHarrak-a/ya-taHarrak-u
o∑sônënànj / n∑sônënJ
to require
taTallab-a/ya-taTallab-u

oºs∏n°ùnànj / nºs∏n°ùnJ 
to avoid
tajannab-a/ya-tajannab-u
oÖsænénànj / ÖsænénJ
3 Geminate (doubled) root Form V
Geminate roots in Form V have the following stem patterns: taC1aC2C2aC2- in the
past tense and yataC1aC2C2aC2- in the present. For example;
to hesitate
taraddad-a/ya-taraddad-u
oOsOnônànj / nOsOnônJ
to feel (s.th.); handle, 
taHassas-a/ya-taHassas-u
o¢ùs°ùnënànj / n¢ùs°ùnënJ
touch (s.th.)
4 Hamzated roots in Form V
The hamza may occur in the first, second, or third position in the triliteral root.
Depending on its position, and the surrounding vowels, the hamza may have to
change its “seat” when the verb inflects for person and tense.
4.1 Initial hamza
In hamza-initial Form V verbs, the hamza sits on √alif in both tenses:
to be late
ta√axxar-a/ya-ta√axxar-u
oôsNnCÉnànj / nôsNnCÉnJ
to be affected (by)
ta√aththar-a/ya-ta√aththar-u bi-
pÖoôsKnCÉnànj / nôsKnCÉnJ
to be sorry
ta√assaf-a/ya-ta√assaf-u
o∞s°SnCÉnànj / n∞s°SnCÉnJ

532

oCÉs«n¡nànj / nCÉs«n¡nJ
to predict, forecast
tanabba√-a/ya-tanabba√-u
oCÉsÑnænànj / nCÉsÑnænJ
5 Assimilated roots in Form V
Assimilated roots, where the first radical is either waaw or yaa√, are inflected as
sound roots in Form V; the waaw or yaa√remain in both tenses.
to be extended, spread out
tawassaﬁ-a/ya-tawassaﬁ-u
o™s°Snƒnànj / n™s°SnƒnJ 
to be abundant, plentiful
tawaffar-a/ya-tawaffar-u

o™sbnƒnànj / n™sbnƒnJ 
to stop; stand still
tawaqqaf-a/ya-tawaqqaf-u
o∞sbnƒnànj / n∞sbnƒnJ
6 Hollow roots in Form V
Hollow roots behave as sound roots in Form V, the waaw or yaa√that is the second
radical functions as a normal consonant, with shadda.
to change (intr.)
taghayyar-a/ya-taghayyar-u
oônq«n¨nànj / nôs«n¨nJ
to volunteer
taTawwaﬁ-a/ya-taTawwaﬁ-u
o´sƒn£nànj / n´sƒn£nJ
7 Defective roots in Form V: tafaﬁﬁaa ≈q©nØnJ/ ya-tafaﬁﬁaa ≈q©nØnànj
Defective roots, where the final radical is either waaw or yaa√, behave as -aa/-aa
verbs in Form V.5
to receive, accept 
talaqqaa/ya-talaqqaa
≈q≤n∏nànj / ≈q≤n∏nJ
to wish
tamannaa/ya-tamannaa
≈qænªnànj / ≈qænªnJ
to trespass, to transcend
taﬁaddaa/ya-taﬁaddaa
iqón©nànj / iqón©nJ
to challenge 
taHaddaa/ya-taHaddaa
iqónënJnj / iqón–
5 They depend on the stem vowel for the nature of the final radical, and the stem vowel is consis-
tently /a/ in the past tense and also /a/ in the present tense.

Form V Defective root: iqónënànj , iqónënJ
AP: qmónënàoe
PP: kiqónënàoe
VN: qmónënJ
‘to challenge’

1 Basic characteristics
1.1 Pattern: tafaaﬁal-a nπnYÉØnJ /ya-tafaaﬁal-u oπnYÉØnànj
Form VI verbs are augmented with respect to Form I in that there is a prefixed
/ta-/ and a long vowel /-aa-/ inserted after the first consonant of the triliteral root.
It looks like a Form III verb with a /ta-/ prefix. In the present tense, the subject-
marking prefix vowel is fatHa and the two stem vowels are fatHa. Form VI verbs
thus have the stem patterns taC1aaC2C2aC3- in the past tense and ya-taC1aaC2aC3-
in the present.
1.2 Meaning
In many cases Form VI is the reciprocal of the Form III verb, meaning that the
action expressed in Form VI is mutual and happens to two (or more) parties (e.g.,
‘to embrace one another’ taﬁaanaq-a ≥nfÉ©nJ/ya-taﬁaanaq-u o≥nfÉ©nànj).1 Other meanings
of this form of the verb include gradual, continuous movement or increase in a
quality (e.g., ‘to diminish, grow smaller’ taDaa√al-a n∫nAÉ°†nJ/ya-taDaa√al-u o∫nAÉ°†nànj),
and also pretending or feigning something (e.g., ‘to feign ignorance’ tajaahal-a
nπngÉénJ/ya-tajaahal-u oπngÉénànj).
1.3 Transitivity
Form VI verbs are often reciprocal or intransitive, but sometimes they are
transitive.
1.4 Inﬂection
The present tense subject-marker vowel is fatHa and both the past and present
tense stem vowels are fatHa (e.g., tabaadal-a/ya-tabaadal-u ‘to exchange’).
2 Regular (sound) triliteral root
These verbs are examples of Form VI sound triliteral roots:
543
27
Form VI triliteral verb
1 See LeTourneau 1998 for discussion of Form VI reciprocality.

to retire, be pensioned
taqaaﬁad-a/ya-taqaaﬁad-u
oónYÉ≤nànj / nónYÉ≤nJ 
to correlate (with)
taraafaq-a/ya-taraafaq-u (maﬁ-a)
(™e) o≥naGônànj / n≥naGônJ 
to understand each
tafaaham-a/ya-tafaaham-u
oºngÉØnànj/ nºngÉØnJ 
other
3 Geminate (doubled) root Form VI
Geminate roots in Form VI have the following stem patterns: taC1aaC2C2aC2- in the
past tense and ya-taC1aaC2C2aC2- in the present. These are very rare. No examples
occurred in the corpus.
4 Hamzated roots in Form VI
The hamza may occur in the first, second, or third position in the triliteral root.
Depending on its position, and the surrounding vowels, the hamza may have to
change its “seat” when the verb inflects for person and tense:
4.1 Initial hamza
When an initial root hamza meets the √alif infix of Form VI, they are written
together as √alif madda:
to deliberate; to 
ta√aamar-a/ya-ta√aamar-u
oôneBÉnànj / nôneBÉnJ
conspire
to harmonize (with 
ta√aallaf-a/ya-ta√aallaf-u 
(™e) o∞ndBÉnànj / n∞ndBÉnJ
each other)
(maﬁa)
4.2 Medial hamza
The medial hamza in Form VI sits aloof, after the long vowel √alif in the past tense.
In the present tense it also sits aloof after the √alif.2
to be optimistic
tafaa√al-a/ya-tafaa√al-u
o∫nAÉØnànj / n∫nAÉØJ 
to be pessimistic
tashaa√am-a/ya-tashaa√am-u
oΩnAÉ°ûànj / nΩnAÉ°ûnJ 
to be mended; be 
talaa√am-a/ya-talaa√am-u
oΩnAÓànj / nΩAÓnJ 
in harmony
to diminish
taDaa√al-a/ ya-taDaa√al-u
o∫nAÉ°†ànj / n∫nAÉ°†nJ 
4.3 Final hamza
Final hamza may sit on an √alif seat in the past tense, but because it is the final
consonant in the stem, the seat of hamza may shift with certain suffixes.
544
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
2 This is because it is situated after a long vowel /aa/ and before a short vowel /a/. It would have an
√alif seat, but two √alifs cannot follow each other in Arabic script, so it floats aloof.

be equal to; to 
takaafa√-a/ya-takaafa√-u
oCÉnaÉµnànj / nCÉnaÉµnJ 
counterbalance
5 Assimilated roots in Form VI
Assimilated roots, where the first radical is either waaw or yaa√, are inflected as
sound roots in Form VI; the waaw or yaa√remains.
to coincide; agree with 
tawaafaq-a/ya-tawaafaq-u
o≥naGƒnànj / n≥naGƒnJ 
each other
to be in equilibrium
tawaazan-a/ya-tawaazan-u
o¿nRGƒnànj / n¿nRGƒnJ
6 Hollow roots in Form VI
Hollow roots behave as sound roots in Form VI, the waaw or yaa√that is the second
radical functions as a normal consonant.
to deliberate; consult 
tashaawar-a/ya-tashaawar-u
oQnhÉ°ûnànj / nQnhÉ°ûnJ
one another
to cooperate with 
taﬁaawan-a/ya-taﬁaawan-u

o¢ûnjÉ©nànj / n¢ûnjÉ©nJ
to deal with; treat 
tanaawal-a/ya-tanaawal-u
o∫nhÉænànj / n∫nhÉænJ
7 Defective roots in Form VI
Defective roots, where the final radical is either waaw or yaa√, behave as -aa/-aa
verbs in Form VI. They depend on the stem vowel for the nature of the final
radical, and the stem vowel is consistently /a/ in the past tense and /a/ in the
present tense.
to take, undertake, pursue
taﬁaaTaa/ya-taﬁaaTaa
≈WÉ©nàj / ≈WÉ©nJ

1 Basic characteristics 
1.1 Pattern: infaﬁal-a nπn©nØrfG /ya-nfaﬁil-u oπp©nØrænj
Form VII verbs are augmented with respect to Form I in that a prefix /n/ is added
to the Form I stem. Form VII has the past tense stem inC1aC2aC3- and the present
tense stem -nC1aC2iC3-. A prefixed elidable hamza with kasra is added to the past
tense stem of Form VII; this hamza and its vowel are deleted in the present tense,
replaced by the present tense subject markers. There is a restriction on the roots
that can be used in Form VII: roots beginning with the consonants hamza, waaw,
yaa√, raa√, laam, or nuun do not have a Form VII.1 In these instances, either Form V
or Form VIII is used instead.
1.2 Meaning
Form VII verbs may be reflexive, resultative, passive, or mediopassive in meaning.
They may express the consequences of a Form I verb action and have been classified
also as verbs that express ergative and “unaccusative” constructions in Arabic.2 The
Arabic term for referring to their meaning is muTaawiﬁ‘obeying, corresponding
with’ – that is, Form VII verbs show the result of Form I action, e.g., fataH-tu l-baab-a
fa-nfataH-a ‘I opened (Form I) the door and it opened (Form VII).’3
1.3 Transitivity
Form VII verbs are intransitive.
1.4 Inﬂection
The prefixed hamzat al-waSl with kasra in the past tense stem is deleted in the pres-
ent tense and replaced by the subject-marker prefix. The vowel of the present

Form VII triliteral verb
1 The prefixed /n/ of Form VII is considered phonologically incompatible with these consonants. In
addition, roots whose initial consonant is miim are relatively rare in Form VII in MSA.
2 See Mahmoud 1991 for further discussion and definition of Arabic unaccusatives.
3 For more on muTaawiﬁsee Chapter 26 on Form V, note 4.

tense subject-marker prefix is fatHa and the stem vowel in the present tense is
kasra (e.g., inSaraf-a/ya-nSarif-u ‘to leave, go out’).

oºp°ùn≤rænj / nºn°ùn≤rfpG 
to be cut off

3 Geminate (doubled) root Form VII
Geminate roots in Form VII have the following stem patterns: inC1aC2C2- in the
past tense and ya-nC1aC2C2 - in the present.
to affiliate; join (with)
inDamm-a/ya-nDamm-u (√ilaa)

tπnërænj / sπnërfnG
to split, crack
inshaqq-a/ya-nshaqq-u
t≥n°ûrænj / s≥n°ûrfpG
4 Hamzated roots in Form VII
The hamza may occur in the second or third position of the triliteral root in Form
VII, but not in root-initial position. Depending on its position and the surround-
ing vowels, the hamza may have to change its “seat” when the verb inflects for per-
son and tense:
Medial hamza: rare
Final hamza:
to be extinguished
inTafa√-a/ya-nTafi√-u

5 Assimilated roots in Form VII
These do not occur (see 1.1).
6 Hollow roots in Form VII infaal-a n∫ÉØrfG /ya-nfaal-u o∫ÉØrænj
Hollow roots in Form VII are inflected with √alif as the long vowel and fatHa as the
short vowel in the present and in the past: inC1aaC3-a /ya-nC1aaC3 -u.

1 Basic characteristics
1.1 Pattern: iftaﬁal-a nπn©nàrapG / ya-ftaﬁil-u oπp©nàrØnj
Form VIII verbs are augmented with respect to Form I in that an infix /t/ is added
to the Form I stem after the first radical. Thus Form VIII has the past tense stem
iC1taC2aC3- and the present tense stem -C1taC2iC3-. A prefixed elidable hamza with
kasra is added to the past tense stem of Form VIII in order to make it pronounce-
able; this hamza and its vowel are deleted in the present tense, replaced by the
present tense subject markers.
1.2 Meaning
Form VIII verbs may be reflexive or medio-passive in meaning, but they also
express a wide range of meanings that are difficult to predict. They may
express the consequences of a Form I verb action and are sometimes considered
resultative (muTaawiﬁ´phÉ£oe), in the same way that Form VII verbs may be resul-
tative of the action of a Form I verb. This is especially true for verb roots start-
ing with the consonants hamza, waaw, yaa√, raa√, laam or nuun, because these
roots do not occur in Form VII and often use Form VIII instead to express the
resultative (e.g., Form I rafaﬁ-a/ya-rfaﬁ-u ‘to raise’ and Form VIII irtafaﬁ-a n™nØnJrQpG /ya-
rtafiﬁ-u o™pØnJrônj ‘to be raised, to rise’). Form VIII is distinguished from Form VII by
the ability to have a reciprocal meaning, that is, the action takes place mutu-
ally among several entities, e.g., Form I jamaﬁ-a/ya-jmaﬁ-u ‘to collect, gather
(s.th.)’ and Form VIII ijtamaﬁ-a n™nªnàrLpG / ya-jtamiﬁ-u o™pªnàrénj to meet with each other;
collect together.’1
1.3 Transitivity
Form VIII verbs may be transitive or intransitive. Some are doubly transitive, such
as iﬁtabar-a nônÑnàrYpG /ya-ﬁtabir-u oôpÑnàr©nj ‘to consider (s.o.) (s.th.).’
565

Form VIII triliteral verb
1 On this point see Fleisch 1979, II: 311.

1.4 Inﬂection
The prefixed hamzat al-waSl with kasra in the past tense stem is deleted in the pres-
ent tense and replaced by the subject-marker prefix. The vowel of the present
tense subject-marker prefix is fatHa and the stem vowel in the present tense is
kasra (e.g., intaxab-a nÖnînàrfpG /ya-ntaxib-u oÖpînàrænj ‘to elect’).
1.5 Special phonological characteristics of Form VIII
The insertion of the extraneous consonant /t/ within the root sometimes affects
the spelling and pronunciation of Form VIII verbs. Various forms of assimilation
of the infixed taa√to the initial root consonant occur, and with assimilated verb
roots the taa√itself assimilates the initial waaw or yaa√completely.
1.5.1 Progressive assimilation
In progressive assimilation, the taa√is influenced by the preceding sound in the
word.
1.5.1.1 VELARIZATION: Where the initial root consonant is velarized (S, D, T, Z)
and the infixed taa√acquires the velarization feature. This results in a spelling
change from taa√to Taa√.

lates to the /z/ sound by becoming a voiced dental stop (daal) instead of a
voiceless dental stop (/t/). That is, instead of iftaﬁal-a it becomes ifdaﬁal-a.

1.5.2 Form VIII regressive assimilation
In regressive assimilation, the initial root consonant waaw or yaa√is affected by
the infixed taa√and is assimilated into it. That is, for example, instead of the
shape *iwtaHad-a (from the root w-H-d) the actual Form VIII verb is ittaHad-a.

1 Basic characteristics
1.1 Pattern: ifﬁall-a sπn©rapG / ya-fﬁall-u tπn©rØnj
Form IX verbs are augmented with respect to Form I in that the final root conso-
nant is doubled and the first and second root consonants are not separated by
a vowel. Form IX has the past tense stem iC1C2aC3C3 - and the present tense
stem -C1C2aC3C3-. A prefixed elidable hamza with kasra is added to the past
tense stem of Form IX to make it pronounceable; this hamza and its vowel are
deleted in the present tense, replaced by the present tense subject markers. The
vowel of the present tense subject marker in Form IX is fatHa.
1.2 Meaning
Form IX verbs generally denote the acquisition of a color or a physical trait. They
are normally based on roots occurring in the √afﬁal adjectival pattern, as the
colors, e.g., √aswad ‘black,’ √aHmar ‘red,’ or adjectives that describe physical
defects. These verbs are infrequent in MSA.1
1.3 Transitivity
Form IX verbs are intransitive.
1.4 Inﬂection
The prefixed hamzat al-waSl with kasra in the past tense stem is deleted in the pres-
ent tense and replaced by the subject-marker prefix. The vowel of the present tense
subject-marker prefix is fatHa and the stem vowel in the present tense is fatHa.

6 Hollow roots in Form IX
The semi-consonant of the hollow root stabilizes in Form IX and acts as a strong
consonant (waaw or yaa√):
to become black
iswadd-a/ya-swadd-u
tOnƒr°ùnj / sOƒr°SpG
to be or become white

1 Basic characteristics
1.1 Pattern: istafﬁal-a nπn©rØnàr°SpG/ya-stafﬁil-u oπp©rØnàr°ùnj
Form X verbs are augmented with respect to Form I in that a prefixed /-st-/ is added
and the first and second root consonants are not separated by a vowel. Form X
has the past tense stem istaC1C2aC3- and the present tense stem -staC1C2iC3-. A
prefixed elidable hamza with kasra is added to the past tense stem of Form X to
make it pronounceable; this hamza and its vowel are deleted in the present tense,
replaced by the present tense subject markers. The vowel of the present tense
subject marker in Form X is fatHa.
1.2 Meaning
Form X verbs may be requestative or estimative but may also reflect other semantic
modifications of the base form. Examples of requestatives include:
to request guidance 
istarshad-a/ya-starshid-u
oOp°ûônàr°ùnj / nOn°ûôràr°SpG
(from s.o.)
to request or seek 
istafsar-a/ya-stafsir-u
oô°pùrØnàr°ùnj /n ôn°ùrØnàr°SpG
explanation (from s.o.)
Examples of estimatives include:
to consider (s.th.) good
istaHsan-a/ya-staHsin-u
oøp°ùrënàr°ùnj / nøn°ùrënàr°SpG
to consider (s.th.) strange
istaghrab-a/ya-staghrib-u
oÜpôr¨nàr°ùnj / nÜnôr¨nàr°SpG
Form X may be the reflexive of Form IV: Wright writes (1967, I:44) : “Form X
converts the factitive signification of Form IV into the reflexive or middle.” For
example, Form IV √aﬁadd-a sónYnCG /yu-ﬁidd-u tóp©oj ‘to prepare (s.th.)’ and Form X istaﬁadd-a
són©nàr°SpG /ya-staﬁidd-u tóp©nàr°ùnj ‘to prepare one’s self, get ready.’
1.3 Transitivity
Form X verbs may be transitive or intransitive.1
31
Form X triliteral verb
1 Kouloughli (1994, 208) reports that Form X is transitive more than 75 percent of the time.

1.4 Inﬂection
The prefixed hamzat al-waSl with kasra in the past tense stem is deleted in the
present tense and replaced by the subject-marker prefix. The vowel of the present
tense subject-marker prefix is fatHa and the stem vowel in the present tense is
kasra (e.g., istaqbal-a nπnÑr≤nàr°SpG /ya-staqbil-u oπpÑr≤nàr°ùnj ‘to receive (s.o.)’).

These forms of the triliteral verb are chiefly archaic and/or poetic in use. For the
sake of completeness, they are described briefly here, but few examples occurred
in the corpus, and even in Classical Arabic, they are rare. Examples are taken from

This form is related to Form IX and usually denotes a similar concept: the acqui-
sition or existence of a color or physical trait.2 It is prefixed with hamzat al-waSl
and is distinguished by the lengthening of the stem vowel from fatHa to √alif, and
the doubling of the final consonant, giving the pattern iC1C2aaC3C3-a/ya-
C1C2aaC3C3-u. It is intransitive.

1 Fleisch (1979, II:330–35) provides examples and discussion of the etymology of these forms.
Haywood and Nahmad (1962, 152–53) have a comprehensive verb form chart that includes Forms
XI–XV. Although some grammars include the verbal nouns of these forms, most do not include
the participles, so I have omitted these, except where they are found in Wehr 1979.
2 See Haywood and Nahmad 1962, 185. Wright (1967, I:43–44) states: “According to some grammarians,
the distinction between the ninth and the eleventh forms is, that the ninth indicates permanent
colours or qualities, the eleventh those that are transitory or mutable . . . Others hold that Form XI
indicates a higher degree of the quality than IX.”

quadriliteral, the third and fourth root consonants are different. See Chapter 33, section 4.

1 Basic characteristics of quadriliteral verb roots (√afﬁaal rubaaﬁiyya áq«YÉHQ ∫É©aCG)
Quadriliteral verb roots contain four consonants instead of three (e.g., zaxraf-a
n±nôrNnR / yu-zaxrif-u o±pôrNnõoj ‘to embellish, adorn’ or fahras-a n¢Snôr¡na / yu-fahris-u o¢Spôr¡nØoj
‘to compile an index, to index’). Sometimes the four consonants are all different
and sometimes they are reduplicated.
1.1 Reduplicated quadriliteral verbs
In reduplicated quadriliteral verbs the first two consonants repeat themselves
(somewhat like English words such as chitchat, zigzag, or mishmash). These verbs
usually refer to repeated motion or sound. When referring to a sound, they are
onomatopoeic; that is, they reflect or mimic the sound itself (e.g., rafraf-a n±nôranQ /
yu-rafrif-u o±pôranôoj ‘to flutter,’ waswas-a n¢Snƒr°Snh / yu-waswis-u o¢Spƒr°Snƒoj ‘to whisper’).
1.2 Complex roots 
Complex roots combine elements from more than one root into a quadriliteral verb
(e.g., basmala)nπnªr°ùnH / yu-basmil-uoπpªr°ùnÑoj ‘to say bi-sm-i llaah-i¬q∏dG º°ùH ‘in the name of God.’
1.3 Borrowed roots
Quadriliteral verb patterns are sometimes used to borrow verbal concepts from
another language (e.g., talfan-a nønØr∏nJ /yu-talfin-u oøpØr∏nàoj ‘to telephone’).
1.4 Forms
Quadriliteral roots occur in four different forms or stem classes, labeled with
roman numerals I-IV, along the same lines as the labeling system for the ten forms
of the triliteral verb. Forms I and II of the quadriliterals are by far the most com-
mon in MSA.
2 Form I: faﬁlal-a nπn∏r©na /yu-faﬁlil-u oπp∏r©nØoj
2.1 Pattern
The consonant-vowel distribution pattern for Form I of the quadriliteral verb mir-
rors Form II of the triliteral: C1aC2C3aC4-/yu-C1aC2C3iC4-. This is possible because
599
33
Quadriliteral verbs

the triliteral Form II is increased by one consonant by virtue of the doubling of its
second radical. The difference between them is that in a quadriliteral verb Form I,
the two middle consonants are different, whereas in a Form II triliteral, they are
the same.
2.2 Transitivity
Form I quadriliterals may be transitive or intransitive.
2.3 Regular quadriliterals
In regular or sound quadriliteral roots, all the consonants are different. Most
quadriliterals of this type contain a “liquid” consonant: /r/, /l/, /n/.1
to obstruct
ﬁarqal-a/yu-ﬁarqil-u
oπpbrôn©oj / nπnbrônY
to translate
tarjam-a/yu-tarjim-u
oºpLrônàoj / nºnLrônJ
to dominate
sayTar-a/yu-sayTir-u
oôp£r«n°ùoj / nôn£r«n°S
to prove
barhan-a/yu-barhin-u
oøpgrônÑoj / nøngrônH
2.4 Reduplicated quadriliterals
In these roots the first two consonants are repeated, either in imitation of a sound
or to refer to a movement, especially a repeated movement.2
to gargle
gharghar-a/yu-gharghir-u
oôpZrôn¨oj / nônZrônZ
to flutter
rafraf-a/yu-rafrif-u
o±pôranôoj / n±nôranQ
to move, to budge
zaHzaH-a/yu-zaHziH-u
oìpõrMnõoj / nìnõrMnR 
to ruin, demolish
DaﬁDaﬁ-a/yu-DaﬁDiﬁ-u
o™p°†r©n°†oj / n™n°†r©n°V

2.5 Complex roots
2.5.1 Acronymic roots
This involves taking the initial letters of a string of words in a traditional, formu-
laic saying, or an often-repeated phrase, and turning them into a lexical root. It is

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
1 Certain quadriliteral verbs appear to be expanded triliterals, with liquid or continuant phonemes
/r/, /n/, /m/, /l/, or /w/ added to the root. They are called mulHaqaat bi-l-rubaaﬁiyy ,»YÉHôdÉH äÉ≤ë∏e,
for example: zaHlaf-a n∞n∏rMnR /yu-zaHlif-uo∞p∏rMnõoj ‘to roll along’  from z-H-f ± - ì-R ‘advance slowly.’
See Roochnik, n.d:, Sterling 1904, 26–27; Wright 1967, I:47–48.
2 For a semantic analysis of reduplicated quadriliteral verbs see Procházka 1993.

somewhat like creating an acronym, but in Arabic this particular usage creates
verbs that denote saying a set phrase.
basmal-a/yu-basiml-u
oπpªr°ùnÑoj / nπnªr°ùnH 
to say: bi-ism-i llaah-i ¬q∏dG º°ùH (‘in the name of God’)
Hawqal-a/yu-Hawqil-u
oπpbrƒnëoj / nπnbrƒnM
to say:
p¬qddÉH q’EG nIqƒob ’nh n∫rƒnM ’
laa Hawl-a wa laa quwwat-a √illaa bi-llaah-i
(‘There is no power and no strength save in God’)
fadhlak-a/yu-fadhlik-u
o∂pdrònØoj / n∂ndròna 
to say Gòncnh Gònc n∂pdòna
fa-dhaalika kadhaa wa-kadhaa . . .
(‘And that is thus and so . . .’)
2.5.2 Compound roots
These verbs combine consonants from two roots. They are mostly of older usage.
to worship the sun
ﬁabsham-a/yu-ﬁabshim-u
oºp°ûrÑn©oj / nºn°ûrÑnY
(from roots: O - Ü - ´ ﬁ-b-d ‘to serve, to worship’ and ¢S - Ω -¢T sh-m-s ‘sun’)
to be petrified
jalmad-a/yu-jalmid-u
oópªr∏néoj / nónªr∏nL
(from roots: O - ∫ ` ê j-l-d ‘freeze’ and O - Ω - ê j-m-d ‘harden’)
2.6 Borrowed quadriliterals
Verbal concepts from foreign languages can sometimes be transferred into Arabic
through use of the quadriliteral verb pattern.
to telephone
talfan-a/yu-talfin-u
oøpØr∏nàoj / nønØr∏nJ
to televise
talfaz-a/yu-talfiz-u
oôpØr∏nàoj / nõnØr∏nJ
to philosophize
falsaf-a/yu-falsif-u
o∞p°ùr∏nØoj / n∞n°ùr∏na
3 Form II quadriliterals: tafaﬁlal-a nπn∏r©nØnJ / ya-tafaﬁlal-u oπn∏r©nØnànj
3.1 Pattern
The consonant-vowel distribution pattern for Form II quadriliterals mirrors Form
V of the triliteral verb: taCaCCaC-a /ya-taCaCCaC-u.
Quadriliteral verbs

3.2 Meaning
In meaning, this form is often the reflexive, resultative, or passive of the Form I
quadriliteral.

3.3 Denominals
Form II quadriliterals may be denominalizations, as in the following verb:
to concentrate, be centered,
tamarkaz-a/ya-tamarkaz-u
oõncrônªnànj / nõncrônªnJ
concentrated 
(from the noun of place, markaz õncrône ‘center’ from the root R - ∑ -Q r-k-z )
3.4 Verbs of comportment
Form II quadriliterals may also have a meaning of acting or behaving in a certain
way, e.g.,
to play the philosopher,
tafalsaf-a/ya-tafalsaf-u
o∞n°ùr∏nØnànj / n∞n°ùr∏nØnJ
act like a philosopher
to act American
ta√amrak-a/ya-ta√amrak-u
o∑nôrenCÉnànj / n∑nôrenCÉnJ 
4 Form III: ifﬁanlal-a nπn∏ræn©rapG / ya-fﬁanlil-u
3 oπp∏ræn©rØnj
This form of the quadriliteral verb is rare in MSA. It has an infixed /-n-/ inserted
between the second and third radicals of the root and corresponds in meaning to
form VII of the triliteral roots. It is normally intransitive. No occurrences of this
form of the verb occurred in the data covered for this book. Examples include:
to bloom, to flourish
ibranshaq-a/ya-branshiq-u
o≥p°ûrfnôrÑnj / n≥n°ûrfnôrHpG
(Wright 1967, I:49)

3 Whereas Wright (1967) as well as Haywood and Nahmad (1962) give this Form as III, other authors,
including the MECAS grammar (1965, 225) and Sterling (1904, 26) give it as Form IV of the
quadriliteral, and Form IV as Form III.

Form IV of the quadriliteral corresponds in meaning to Form IX of the triliteral
verb. The final radical is doubled, giving the pattern iCCaCaCC-a, ya-CCaCiCC-u. It
denotes an intensity of quality or degree and is intransitive.

8 Form I quadriliteral participles
Quadriliteral verb participles are formed on the same basis as participles of
triliteral verb roots. There are active and passive participles, all prefixed with /mu-/
and differentiated by a stem vowel /-i-/ for the active participle and stem vowel /-a-/
for the passive participle. They occur both as nouns and as adjectives.

Quadriliteral verbs
605

606
Mood or “mode” refers to the Arabic verb properties indicative, subjunctive, and
jussive.1 These categories reflect or are caused by contextual modalities that
condition the action of the verb. For example, the indicative mood tends to be
characteristic of straightforward, factual statements or questions, while the sub-
junctive mood reflects an attitude toward the action such as doubt, desire, intent,
wishing, or necessity, and the jussive mood, when used for the imperative, indi-
cates an attitude of command, request, or need for action on the part of the
speaker.
In Arabic, mood marking is only done on the present tense or imperfective
stem; there are no mood variants for the past tense. The Arabic moods are
therefore non-finite; that is, they do not refer to points in time and are not dif-
ferentiated by tense. Tense is inferred from context and other parts of the
clause.2
1 The indicative mood: al-muDaariﬁal-marfuuﬁ´ƒaôŸG´QÉ°†ŸG
The indicative mood is considered the basic mood; it is used in factual statements
or straightforward questions. It is also used in statements about the future, either
with the future markers sa- n`°S or sawfa n±rƒn°S, or in a context that refers to a future
action. A full paradigm of the indicative mood for a regular Form I verb is as
follows:
34
Moods of the verb I: indicative and
subjunctive
1 An additional mood, the “energetic” exists in Classical Arabic but not in MSA. It denotes an
intensified affirmation of action. See Wright 1967, I:61ff. and Fischer 2002, 110 and 118 for more
on the energetic mood.
2 The question of mood marking (on verbs) is a central one in traditional Arabic grammar, along
with case marking (on nouns and adjectives). Moods fall under the topic of morphology because
they are indicated in Arabic word structure, that is, they are usually marked by suffixes or
modifications of suffixes attached to the present tense verb stem. Moods also, however, fall
under the topic of syntax because their use is determined either by particles which govern their
occurrence, or by the narrative context in general, including attitude of the speaker and intended
meaning. They are therefore referred to in some reference works and theoretical discussions as
“morphosyntactic” categories, combining features of morphology and syntax.

Moods of the verb I: indicative and subjunctive
607
It is the suffix on the verb that indicates the mood. The indicative mood shows
the full form of the suffixes, and that is one reason why it is considered the base
form. Particular indicators of the indicative are:
1.
the short vowel Damma (-u-) suffix on five of the persons (I, we, you m.sg., he
and she);3
2.
the /-na/ suffix after the long vowel /-uu- / in the second and third persons
masculine plural and after /-ii-/ in the second person feminine singular;
3.
the /-ni/ suffix after the long vowel /-aa-/ in the dual.

3 It is this Damma suffix that leads to the name of the mood, because the Damma mood marker
resembles the Damma case marker on nouns. Both the indicative mood and the nominative case
are called marfuuﬁin Arabic.

2 The subjunctive mood: al-muDaariﬁal-manSuub Üƒ°üæŸG  ´QÉ°†ŸG
The subjunctive mood is a form of the present tense, or imperfect, that occurs
under specific circumstances in Arabic, taking the form of a distinct subset of
inflectional endings on the imperfect verb stem, in other words, a separate con-
jugation. It has the following features: the short inflectional vowel suffix is fatHa
(instead of the Damma of the indicative). For the longer verb suffixes, such as 

Moods of the verb I: indicative and subjunctive
609
/-uuna/, /-iina/, and /-aani/, the nuun and its short vowel are dropped, so the suffixes
are left as long vowels /-uu/, /-ii/, /-aa/.4
Because of the use of fatHa instead of Damma as the short vowel suffix, the sub-
junctive mood is referred to in Arabic as al-muDaariﬁal-manSuub ´QÉ°†ŸG
Üƒ°üæŸG, using the same term for the subjunctive as for the accusative case on
nouns and adjectives (al-manSuub Üƒ°üæŸG).

In general, the subjunctive mood is determined by an attitude toward the ver-
bal action such as volition, intent, purpose, doubt, attempting, expectation, per-
mission, hope, ability, or necessity. In Arabic, the subjunctive is also syntactically
determined by the presence of particular ‘subjunctivizing’ particles. Those par-
ticles include lan ønd, which negates the future; a series of particles that express
purpose (li- p`d, kay r»nc, li-kay r»nµpd, Hattaa ≈qàM), and the subordinating conjunction
particle √an, which links a subordinate clause to a main clause. The subjunctive
mood may also occur in the passive voice.
2.1 Negative particle: lan rønd ‘will not; shall not’
After the negative particle lan the subjunctive is used. This combination of lan 
subjunctive yields a future negative.

2.2 Particles of purpose
These particles are subordinating conjunctions that denote the sense of ‘in order
to’ or ‘in order that.’ With certain particles a verbal noun may be substituted for
the subjunctive verb.
2.2.1 li- p`d ‘for; to; in order to, in order that’
The purpose particle li- p`d may be followed by a verb in the subjunctive, or by a ver-
bal noun in the genitive case.

2.2.6 Hattaa ≈qàM ‘in order that’
The particle Hattaa has other meanings, as well (‘until’ or ‘even’), but when used
with a verb in the subjunctive it indicates purpose.
πª©dG Gòg áHƒ©°U  n∑Qóf  ≈qàM
Hattaa nu-drik-a Suﬁuubat-a haadhaa l-ﬁamal-i

2.3 Subordinating conjunction: √an r¿nCG  subjunctive
The particle / √an/ ¿CG follows certain types of verbs in order to conjoin a complement
clause to the verb. These verbs (sometimes called “matrix” verbs) usually denote atti-
tudes or feelings toward the action such as liking, disliking, expecting, deciding,
intending, wanting, wishing, requesting, possibility, attempting, needing.5 For
example:
to like, love
√aHabb-a √an
r¿CG qÖMCG
to be possible √amkan-a √an
r¿CG øµeCG
to decide
qarrar-a √an
r¿CG Qqôb

5 Cantarino states: “after verbs that present their objects as something striven for or simply as a
possibility or capability of a future action, only √an will be used” (1975, III:107). See his extensive
section on √an 1975, III: 107–16. Compare these verbs to verbs followed by the particle √anna, which
is used to report factual information in a subordinate clause (see Chapter 19, section 2.3).

612
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
In most cases, the √an r¿CG  subjunctive structure is replaceable with a verbal
noun. Thus it is possible to have sentences such as:
.nCGô≤f  r¿CG tÖëf
nu-Hibb-u √an na-qra√-a.
We like to read (lit. ‘we like that we read’).6
or
.IAGô≤dG tÖëf
nu-Hibb-u l-qiraa√at-a.
We like to read (lit. ‘we like reading’). 
Sentences in English may use the infinitive (e.g., “to read”) as the equivalent of
either structure. For example:
.≈°ùæf  r¿CG  oójôf  ’
laa nu-riid-u √an na-nsaa.
We don’t want to forget (‘that we forget’).
.¬n∏©Øf  r¿CG  o™«£à°ùf
na-staTiiﬁ-u √an na-fﬁal-a-hu.
We are able to do it (‘we are able that we do it’).
.óZ ó©H óYƒŸG n¿ƒµj  r¿CG  âÑ∏W qºK
thumm-a Talab-at √an ya-kuun-a l-mawﬁid-u baﬁd-a ghad-in.
Then it requested that the appointment be [the day] after tomorrow.
2.3.1 qabl-a √an r¿CG πÑb ‘before’ and baﬁd-a √an r¿CG ó©H ‘after’
The particle √an also follows certain semi-prepositions so that they may be fol-
lowed by a verb phrase or entire clause.7
2.3.1.1 qabl-a √an ¿CG  πÑb ‘BEFORE’: The semi-preposition qabl-a πÑb by itself must
be directly followed by a noun or a pronoun suffix. Using √an as a buffer, qabl-a
may be followed by a verb in the subjunctive mood. Tense is inferred from context.

6 For more detailed description of the use of the verbal noun in such structures, see Chapter 5,
section 1.3.
7 Normally, prepositions and semi-prepositions are followed by a noun in the genitive case or by a
pronoun.

He said that before he lightened the penalty.
2.3.1.2 baﬁd-a √an r¿CG ó©H ‘AFTER’: The phrase baﬁd-a √an ¿CG ó©H may be followed
either by a verb in the subjunctive mood or by a past tense verb. It requires a verb
in the subjunctive if the situation is not yet an actual fact, that is, if the situation
is in the future or is still a possibility.
However, if the situation is in the past and has already taken place, baﬁd-a √an
¿CG ó©H is followed by a past tense verb. The latter case is one of the few situations
where the particle √an ¿CG is followed by anything other than a subjunctive.8

.n¢SQóf  r¿CG  ó©H oπcCÉæn°S

2.3.2 Impersonal verbs  subjunctive
Certain impersonal verbal expressions followed by /√an/ r¿CG plus a verb in the sub-
junctive indicate necessity or possibility:
it is necessary that
ya-jib-u √an9
r¿CG Öéj
it ought to be that
ya-nbaghii √an
r¿CG »¨Ñæj
it is possible that
yu-mkin-u √an
r¿CG øµÁ
min-a l-mumkin-i √an
r¿CG øµªŸG øe
8 Al-Warraki and Hassanein (1994, 51) state it clearly: “If baﬁd-a √an is preceded by a perfect
[verb] in the main clause, it is also followed by a perfect; if it is preceded by imperfect or
future in the main clause, it is followed by a subjunctive.” They devote an entire chapter to
baﬁd-a √an and qabl-a √an.
9 The phrase ya-jib-u an may include the use of the preposition ﬁalaa to specify for whom the action
is necessary, e.g., ya-jib-u ﬁalay-naa √an nu-faawiD-a ¢VhÉØf ¿CG Éæ«∏Y Öéj ‘We have to negotiate (it is
necessary/ incumbent upon us that we negotiate’).

The preposition ﬁalaa may indicate necessity or incumbence “upon” someone to
do something. It may be used with a pronoun suffix or with a noun in the geni-
tive, followed by √an and a verb in the subjunctive.

1 The jussive: al-jazm Ωõ÷G
The jussive mood is restricted in occurrence. It does not carry a particular semantic
content; rather, it is a mood of the verb required in written Arabic under specific
circumstances. The distinctive feature of jussive inflection is the absence of a
final short inflectional vowel. Where the indicative mood inflects with Damma
and the subjunctive mood inflects with fatHa, the jussive mood inflects with
sukuun.
Like the subjunctive, the jussive shortens the longer verb suffixes, such as /-uuna/,
/-iina/, and /-aani/, by deleting the nuun and its short vowel, so those suffixes are
left as long vowels /-uu/, /-ii/, /-aa/. Again, as with the subjunctive and indicative,
the /-na/ of the second and third persons feminine plural is retained.

The absence of an inflectional vowel in the first person singular and plural, the
second person masculine singular and the third persons feminine and masculine
singular causes certain pronunciation and spelling changes in geminate, hollow,
and defective verbs.
1.2 Jussive mood paradigm: geminate Form I verb
When the jussive mood is used with geminate verbs, the deletion of the inflec-
tional short vowel in the first person singular and plural, the second person
masculine singular, and the third persons feminine and masculine singular
causes a consonant cluster to occur at the end of the inflected verb, and this
violates the phonological rule against word-final consonant clusters in MSA. To
counteract this, a short vowel /-a/ is added to these persons of the verb in order
to make them pronounceable. However, the addition of the short vowel /-a/
has the effect of making the jussive of geminate verbs look exactly like the
subjunctive.

1.5 Use of the jussive
The jussive is used in essentially five ways: with conditional sentences, with the
negative particle lam rºnd; with the negative imperative particle laa ’, the indirect
imperative particle /li/ p`d, and as a basis for forming the imperative.
Most often, the jussive mood in MSA is used with the negative particle lam to
negate the past tense, and with the imperative.
1.5.1 In conditional sentences
The jussive in conditional sentences occurred rarely in the MSA database covered
for this analysis. This particular function of the jussive is more common in
literary and classical texts.1 For discussion of this use of the jussive see Chapter 39
on conditional and optative expressions.

1.5.2 With lam ⁄
The negative particle lam is used to negate the past tense. However, it is not used
with a past tense verb. Instead, it is used with the jussive form of the verb,
conveying a meaning of past tense. In Arabic grammatical terms if is said to
“transform the [meaning of] the verb following it to the past.”3

2 The imperative: al-√amr ôeC’G
The imperative or command form of the verb in Arabic is based upon the imper-
fect/present tense verb in the jussive mood. It occurs in the second person (all
forms of “you”), for the most part, although it occasionally occurs in the first
person plural (“let’s”) and the third person (“let him/her/them”).
2.1 To form the imperative
The general rule for forming the imperative is to take the second person form of
the jussive verb and remove the subject marker (the ta- or tu- prefix). If the remaining
622
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
2 From Ziadeh and Winder 1957, 160.
3 ﬁAbd al-Latif et al. 1997, 307: “wa-ta-dull-u [lam] ﬁalaa l-nafii, wa-tu-qallib-u l-muDaariﬁ-a baﬁd-a-haa √ilaa
l-maaDii wa-li-dhaalik-a yu-Tliq-u ﬁalay-haa l-muﬁrib-uuna: “Harf-u nafii wa-jazm-in wa-qalb-in.” [The
particle] lam indicates negation, and it transforms the present-tense verb after it into the past
tense and therefore grammarians call it the particle of negation, jussive, and transformation.”

verb stem starts with a consonant-vowel (CV) sequence, then the stem is left as it
is because it is easily pronounceable. If the remaining stem starts with a conso-
nant cluster, then it needs a helping vowel prefix. The nature of the helping vowel
depends on the verb form and (in Form I) the nature of the stem vowel.
For example, the verb katab-a ‘to write’ in the present tense, jussive mood,
second person is:
you (m. sg.) write
ta-ktub
rÖoàrµnJ
you (f. sg.) write
ta-ktub-ii
»ÑoàrµnJ
you two write
ta-ktub-aa
ÉÑoàrµnJ
you (m. pl.) write
ta-ktub-uu
GƒÑoàrµnJ
you (f. pl.) write
ta-ktub-na
nørÑoàrµnJ
To create the imperative, the ta- prefix is dropped, leaving:
*ktub
rÖoàc
*ktub-ii
»Ñoàc
*ktub-aa
ÉÑoàc
*ktub-uu
GƒÑoàc
*ktub-na
nørÑoàc
Because these forms start with consonant clusters, they violate a phonological
rule in Arabic that prohibits word-initial consonant clusters. They therefore need a
helping vowel to be pronounceable. The helping vowel selected in this case is /u/
because the stem vowel of the verb is /u/. However, another rule in Arabic prohibits
words from starting with vowels, so the /u/ vowel is preceded by hamza, and the
hamza plus short vowel sit on an √alif seat. This yields the pronounceable forms:
Write!
u-ktub!
! rÖoàrcoG
u-ktub-ii!
!»ÑoàrcoG
u-ktub-aa!
! ÉÑoàrcoG
u-ktub-uu!
! GƒÑoàrcoG
u-ktub-na!
! nørÑoàrcoG
This helping vowel is used with hamzat al-waSl, that is, elidable hamza, which is
normally not written and drops out if it is preceded by another vowel, as in:
Read and write!
i-qra√wa-ktub!
! rÖoàrcGnh rCGnôrbpG
Moods of the verb II: jussive and imperative
623

Note that although the prefix hamza drops out in pronunciation, the √alif seat
remains in the spelling of the word.
The deletion of the subject-marker prefix (ta- or tu-) does not always leave a stem
that starts with two consonants. For example, in the Form II verb fassar-a nôs°ùna ‘to
explain’:
you (m. sg.) explain
tu-fassir
rôu°ùnØoJ 
you (f. sg.) explain
tu-fassir-ii
…ôu°ùnØoJ 
you two explain
tu-fassir-aa
Gôu°ùnØoJ
you (m. pl.) explain
tu-fassir-uu
Ghôu°ùnØoJ
you (f. pl.) explain
tu-fassir-na
n¿rôu°ùnØoJ
The imperative forms stripped of the subject marker are:
Explain!
fassir!
!rôu°ùna
fassir-ii!
! …ôu°ùna
fassir-aa!
!Gôu°ùna
fassir-uu!
!Ghôu°ùna 
fassir-na!
! n¿rôu°ùna 
These are pronounceable just as they are, so they need no initial helping vowel
and are left as they are in the imperative.
2.1.1 Summary
The word-initial helping vowel is needed in the imperative of Forms I, IV, VII, VIII,
and X of the verb. Forms II, III, V, and VI do not need helping vowels in the imper-
ative. The specifics of the Forms are summarized here.
2.2 Form I imperatives
Form I imperatives usually require initial helping vowels, either /i/ or /u/. The
nature of the helping vowel is determined by the stem vowel of the present tense.
If the stem vowel is fatHa or kasra, the helping vowel is kasra; if the stem vowel
is Damma, the helping vowel is Damma.

2.2.2 Hamzated verbs
Form I verbs with initial hamza tend to drop the hamza entirely in the imperative
in order to avoid less acceptable phonological sequences that involve two hamzas
in sequence such as *√u√kul or *√u√xudh:
.Qõ÷G  πoc
!√òg ròoN
kul-i l-jazar-a.
xudh haadhihi!

2.2.3 Geminate verbs
Form I geminate verbs are mixed as to whether or not they take a helping vowel pre-
fix. They do not take the hamza prefix in the forms that end with a long vowel, but
they may or may not take the hamza in the second person masculine singular. If the
hamza is omitted, the imperative in this person takes a final fatHa in order for it to
be pronounceable. A hamza prefix is used in the second person feminine plural.

2.2.4 Assimilated verbs
Most verbs whose initial root consonant is waaw or yaa√(such as waDaﬁ-a/ ya-Daﬁ-u
‘to put, place’) delete that consonant in all moods of the present tense. Therefore
when the subject prefix is deleted from the jussive mood in order to form the
imperative, it leaves a very short but pronounceable stem. For example:
Put!
Daﬁ !

2.2.5 Hollow verbs
Form I hollow verbs, just as regular verbs, make the imperative based on the
jussive forms without the subject-marker prefix. There are two stem variants in
the jussive of hollow verbs, short-vowel and long-vowel. Both stems are
pronounceable without the need for a helping vowel prefix. For example:

2.2.6 Defective verbs
Defective verbs have either waaw or yaa√as their final root consonant. In the
jussive mood, this consonant undergoes shifts in length and quality. The impera-
tive of defectives is based on the jussive form, with no changes except the deletion
of the subject marker and the addition of the helping vowel prefix. As with
regular verbs, the nature of the short helping vowel prefix depends on the stem
vowel of the verb.
2.2.6.1 Yaa√-DEFECTIVE VERBS: The yaa√-defective verbs are of two types: ones that
end in -aa (√alif maqSuura IQƒ°ü≤e ∞dCG) and ones that end with yaa√in the past
tense. The ones ending in -aa usually inflect the present tense with -ii; the ones
that end with yaa√in the past tense take -aa in the present tense. These verbs take
kasra as their imperative prefix helping vowel.

2.2.7 Doubly defective verbs
Doubly defective verbs have semi-consonants and/or hamza in two places, sometimes
as the first and third consonants, and sometimes as the second and third. Their
imperatives are defective in more ways than one. Two examples are given here,
the verb ra√aa iCGnQ / ya-raa iônj ‘to see’ and the verb waﬁaa ≈Ynh / ya-ﬁii »©nj ‘to heed,
pay attention.’

2.12 Quadriliteral imperatives
Using the identical process of stripping the subject prefix from the second person
jussive verb forms, one gets, for example, in the Form I quadriliteral verb tarjam-a
nºnLrônJ ‘to translate’:
Base form jussive:
you (m. sg.) translate
tu-tarjim
rºpLrônàoJ
you (f. sg.) translate
tu-tarjim-ii
»ªpLrônàoJ
you two translate
tu-tarjim-aa
ÉªpLrônàoJ
you (m. pl.) translate
tu-tarjim-uu
GƒªpLrônàoJ
you (f. pl.) translate
tu-tarjim-na
nørªpLrônàoJ
The imperative forms stripped of the subject marker are:
Translate!
tarjim!
! rºpLrônJ
tarjim-ii!
! »ªpLrônJ
tarjim-aa!
! ÉªpLrônJ 
tarjim-uu!
! GƒªpLrônJ
tarjim-na!
! nørªpLrônJ
These are pronounceable so they need no initial helping vowel and are left as
they are in the imperative. Form I is by far the most frequent in usage, since the
Moods of the verb II: jussive and imperative

quadriliteral Form II (for example, tabalwar-a nQnƒr∏nÑnJ ‘to be crystallized’) is often
reflexive or passive in meaning.

3 The permissive or hortative imperative: laam al-√amr ôeC’G  Ω’
An “indirect” type of imperative may be used to exhort or enjoin someone to do
something. This may occur in the first (I, we) or third (he, she, they) persons. In
this type of imperative structure, the jussive verb is used (no deletion of subject
marker), preceded by the particle /li-/ p`d, implying the idea of permission or encour-
agement to do something:
.áq∏°ùdG ‘  rô¶ææpd
li-na-nZur fii l-sallat-i.
Let’s look in the basket.
Sometimes the / li-/ p`d particle is preceded by the particle /fa-/ n`a, in which case
the vowel is dropped from /li-/ making it just /l-/.
rÖgòær∏na
.r´ô°ùær∏na 
fa-l-na-dhhab.
fa-l-na-sriﬁ.
(So) let’s go. 
Let’s hurry.
4 The negative imperative: laa ’  jussive
The negative imperative is formed by using the negative particle laa plus the
jussive form of the (second person) verb. Note that in the negative imperative, the
jussive verb form preserves its prefix. 
Don’t go back!

Verbs of being, becoming, and remaining have special status in Arabic. Because
these verbs resemble each other in meaning and in syntactic effect, they are
referred to as “sisters” of the verb ‘to be,’ kaan-an¿Éc (√axawaat-u kaan-a¿Éc äGƒNCG). All
of them describe states of existence (e.g., being, inception, duration, continuation)
and each of them requires the accusative marker on the predicate or complement
(xabar kaan-a ¿Éc ÈN), e.g., kaan-a zaﬁiim-an kÉª«YR n¿Éc ‘He was a leader.’ The subject
of kaan-a (ism kaan-a¿Éc º°SG) and her sisters, if mentioned specifically, is in the nom-
inative case (e.g., kaan-a l-rajul-u zaﬁiim-an, kÉª«YR oπLôdG n¿Éc ‘The man was a leader’.1
Another special characteristic of kaan-a and her sisters is that they function as
auxiliary verbs. In particular, kaan-a is used for forming compound tenses such as
past progressive and future perfect. Some examples of this are offered here, but
the topic is presented in detail in Chapter 21.
Verbs of seeming or appearing also mark their complements with the accusa-
tive case, but they are not usually classified among the “sisters” of kaan-a.
1 The verb kaan-a n¿Éc /ya-kuun-u o¿ƒµnj ‘to be’
This verb is unusual in that it is not generally used in the present tense indicative.
It is omitted from the syntax of a simple predication. 
1.1 Omission of kaan-a in simple present tense predication
These verbless sentences are usually termed “equational” sentences in English
descriptions of Arabic syntax; in Arabic they are called “nominal sentences” (jumal
ismiyya áq«ª°SG πªL).2 For more on equational sentences, see Chapter 4, section 2.

1 For more extensive discussion of  kaan-a wa-√axawaat-u-haa in Classical Arabic, see Wright 1967,
II:99–109.
2 Arab grammarians actually term any sentence that starts with a noun a “nominal sentence” even
if it includes a verb.  Following the practice of Cantarino (1974, I:2), I use the terms “nominal
sentence” and “equational sentence” as equivalents.

1.2 Use of kaan-a n¿Éc
The verb kaan-a enters when the predication is anything but present tense indica-
tive. It takes a subject in the nominative and it requires that the complement be
in the accusative case.

1.3 The use of kaan-a as auxiliary verb
An important function of kaan-a is as an auxiliary verb in conjunction with main
verbs to construct compound verb forms that convey different temporal mean-
ings. Compound verbs are discussed at greater length in Chapter 21, section 2.
1.3.1 Past progressive
For habitual or continual action in the past, the past tense of kaan-a is used with
the present tense of the main verb. Both the main verb and the auxiliary are
inflected for person, number, and gender.

637
1.3.2 Pluperfect or past perfect
To express an action in the past that is over with and which serves as a background
action for the present, the past tense of kaan-a is used with a past tense of the main
verb. The particle qad r ónb may be optionally inserted just before the main verb.
.IQÉØ°ùdG íàa IOÉYEG ≈∏Y º¡©e  Gƒ∏pªnY (rónb) GƒfÉc

I had supported putting Egypt on the list.
2 The verb lays-a n¢ùr«nd ‘to not be’
This irregular verb negates the present tense. It is discussed in detail in Chapter
37, section 1. It is noted here because it is a sister of kaan-a and requires a comple-
ment in the accusative case. Although it is inflected as a past tense verb, it conveys
negation of the present tense.

.kÉ«eÉﬁ n¢ùr«nd

3 Verbs of becoming: baat-a näÉH, √aSbaH-a nínÑr°UnCG, Saar-a nQÉ°U
Verbs that indicate a change of state or condition are also sisters of kaan-a.
3.1 baat-a näÉH ‘to become; come to be’
The verb baat-a/ya-biit-u indicates a change of state (or sometimes the continuation
of a state) and is used chiefly in the past tense. It may be used as a main verb or as
an auxiliary verb.
.nÚ©æà≤e  GƒJÉH
.q…Qhô°†dG øe  näÉH

3.3 Saar-a /ya-Siir-u oÒ°ünj / nQÉ°U ‘to become; to come to be’
The verb Saar-a was not found to be very frequent in the material covered for this
work. When used as the main verb it has the same meaning and effect as √aSbaH-a. 
.áq«ŸÉY  á«°ù∏WCG  É¡àaÉ≤K  äQÉ°U
Saar-at thaqaafat-u-haa ﬁaalamiyyat-an.

3.3.1 As an auxiliary verb
When used as an auxiliary verb, Saar-a denotes inception and continuation:
.ÈcCG kGQhO  òNCÉJ  äQÉ°U äÉæ«qà°ùdG òæe
mundhu l-sittiinaat-i Saar-at ta-√xudh-u dawr-an √akbar-a.
Since the sixties it has come to play a greater role.
3.3.2 Saar li-
When used with the preposition li- expressing possession, it conveys the idea of
‘come to have’ or ‘come to possess’:
.kÉq«∏µ°T Úq«fÉªã©∏d A’ƒdG QÉ°U
Saar-a l-wilaa√-u li-l-ﬁuthmaaniyy-iina shakliyy-an.

4 Verbs of remaining: baqiy-a n»p≤nH, Zall-a sπnX, maa zaal-a n∫GR  Ée, maa daam-a nΩGO  Ée
Several verbs and verbal expressions that are sisters of kaan-a denote the concept
of remaining in a particular state or condition. They may be used independently
or as auxiliary verbs. These include:

It remained present under the ashes of good relations.
4.3 maa zaal-a / laa ya-zaal-u o∫Gõnj ’ / n∫GR  Ée ‘to remain; to continue to be; to still be’
This expression consists of a negative particle (maa plus the past tense; lam plus
the jussive; or laa plus the imperfect) plus the verb zaal-a ‘to cease,’ thus it
means literally ‘to not cease to be.’ In terms of tense, both the past tense form
and the present tense usually have present tense meaning. Sometimes in con-
text, however, they may refer to the past, or be equivalent to an English past
tense.

5 Verbs of seeming or appearing
These verbs are not considered sisters of kaan-a but are similar in that they take an
object complement in the accusative case even though they are not transitive.

Arabic uses a variety of means to express negation and exception. This is accom-
plished primarily through the use of negative or exceptive particles, which often
affect the following phrase by requiring a particular case on a noun or noun
phrase, or a particular mood of the verb. There is also a verb, lays-a n¢ùr«nd, which has
a negative meaning ‘to not be.’ Each of these negative or exceptive expressions
could be the topic for extensive grammatical analysis, but here their description
is limited to their basic functions in MSA.
1 The verb lays-a n¢ùr«nd ‘to not be’
This verb is exceptional in two ways:
(1)
it is inflected only as a past tense verb but it negates the present tense of
“be”1;
(2)
it is a sister of kaan-a n¿Éc and therefore requires its complement to be in the
accusative case.
1.1 Chart: conjugation of lays-a n¢ùr«nd ‘to not be’
The verb lays-a n¢ùr«nd has only one type of conjugation. It appears on the surface to
resemble a past tense verb because it is inflected with the past tense suffixes, but
in terms of meaning, it negates the present tense. Like a hollow verb, lays-a n¢ùr«nd
has two stems; a short one, las- -r`°ùnd, used when the suffix starts with a consonant,
and a longer stem, lays- `°ùr«nd, used when the suffix starts with a vowel or is only
a vowel.2

Negation and exception
1 Negation of the perfect or past tense of “be” is not done with lays-a, but with the use of the
negative particle lam plus the jussive form of kaan-a ‘to be.’ Similarly, the future tense of “be” is
negated through the use of the future negative particle lan plus the subjunctive of kaan-a. The verb
lays-a, therefore, is specialized and limited to negating the present tense of “be.”
2 Lecomte (1968, 87) states that lays-a “est une curieuse particule pseudo-verbale dotée d’une
conjugaison d’allure concave.”

1.2 Discussion and examples of lays-a n¢ùr«nd
.kÉNqQDƒe oPÉà°SC’G n¢ùr«nd
lays-a l-√ustaadh-u mu√arrix-an.
The professor is not a historian.
In the above example, the verb lays-a n¢ùr«nd starts the sentence, followed by the
subject noun al-√ustaadh-u oPÉà°SC’G in the nominative case. The predicate or com-
plement of the verb lays-a n¢ùr«nd (mu√arrix-an kÉNqQDƒe) is in the accusative case because
lays-a n¢ùr«nd is a “sister” of the verb kaan-a n¿Éc and thus belongs to a group of verbs
that (although intransitive in the traditional sense of the term) take their
complements in the accusative case.3
If the sentence were not negative, it would be equational and verbless. The
subject would be al-√ustaadh-u oPÉà°SC’G and the predicate mu√arrix-un lñqQDƒe, both in
the nominative case, as is the rule with equational sentences:
.lñqQDƒe oPÉà°SC’G
al-√ustaadh-u mu√arrix-un.
The professor is a historian.

3 See Chapter 36, on verbs of being, becoming, remaining, seeming (kaan-a wa-√axawaat-u-haa n¿Éc
É¡JGƒNCGh).

The verb is inflected for the first person (“I”) and the predicate or complement
consists of just one word, an adjective, in the accusative case: lubnaaniyyat-an
áq«fÉæÑd. It is feminine because the writer is feminine and speaking of herself. If the
sentence were not negative it would be:
.lá«fÉæÑd ÉfnCG
√anaa lubnaaniyyat-un.
I [am] Lebanese (f.).
with a pronoun subject (√anaa ÉfnCG ‘I’), no overt verb, and the adjective as predicate,
in the nominative case. For more extensive discussion of equational sentences, see
Chapter 4, section 2.

1.3.2 Predicate of lays-a n¢ùr«nd is a prepositional phrase
The predicate or complement of lays-a may be a prepositional phrase rather than
a noun, noun phrase, or adjective. In this case, the preposition causes the follow-
ing noun to be in the genitive case.
.u…Qhô°†dG øe  n¢ùr«nd

1.3.3 Predicate of lays-a n¢ùr«nd is an adverb
The predicate of lays-a may also be an invariable adverb that does not take case
inflections. In the following sentence, the adverb hunaaka n∑Éæog is the predicate
and Siraaﬁ-un l´Gôp°U ‘struggle’ is the subject of lays-a n¢ùr«nd.

2 Negative particles and their effects
2.1 laa ’ ‘no; not; there is no’
The negative particle laa has five functions: (1) by itself, it can mean simply ‘no’ in
response to a statement, question, or a request; (2) it negates the present tense of
verbs; (3) it is used for the negative imperative; (4) to indicate categorical negation;
and (5) when repeated, indicates ‘neither . . . nor.’
2.1.1 laa  ‘no’
?w…ôr°üpe nâfCG rπg
.kÉqj ô°üpe  oâr°ùnd  .’
hal √anta miSriyy-un?
laa. las-tu miSriyy-an.

2.1.2 laa ’  not; negation of present tense verb
The negative particle laa is used to negate present tense verbs. The verb remains in
the indicative mood.4
.o∫ ƒ≤nJ GPÉe  oºn¡ranCG ’
.oøuNnOoCG ’
laa √a-fham-u maadhaa ta-quul-u.

2.1.3 laa ’ with the subjunctive
2.1.3.1 √allaa q’nCG  √an r¿nCG  laa ’: The negative particle laa may negate a verb in
the subjunctive if there is a subjunctivizing element present. In the following
644
A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
4 In his 1996 article “Negative polarity and presupposition in Arabic” Elabbas Benmamoun proposes
that “negative laa has three different suppletive forms that correlate with different temporal
interpretations: laa which occurs in the present tense . . . , lam which carries past tense . . . , and
lan which carries future tense” (Benmamoun 1996, 51). While all three particles are negations, and
all start with the letter laam, they have different effects on the following verb and are presented
separately here.

sentences, the subjunctivizing phrase ya-jib-u √an (‘it is necessary that’) is followed
by laa plus a verb in the subjunctive, and the subjunctivizing verb phrase,
qarrar-a √an ‘to decide to’ is also followed by laa plus a verb in the subjunctive. The
particles √an and laa are joined together in a contraction, √allaa:
.¬«a  nπnªrYnCG  q’CG oäQqôb
qarrar-tu √allaa √a-ﬁmal-a fii-hi.
I decided not to work in it.
2.1.3.2 laa ’ AFTER Hattaa ≈qànM: The subjunctivizing particle Hattaa ≈qànM ‘in order
that, so that’ may be followed by laa ’ plus a verb in the subjunctive:
ºp¡pà°SÉ«°S pó«jCÉJ  ‘ s£o°ûnj ’ ≈qànM
Hattaa laa ya-shuTT-a fii ta√yiid-i siyaasat-i-him
so that it does not go too far in supporting their policy
2.1.4 laa ’  verb as modiﬁer
A negative verb phrase is occasionally used to express a negative adjectival or
adverbial concept in Arabic. This phrase usually takes the form of an indefinite
relative clause:
póé°ùŸG nÜôb  oCGór¡nJ ’ ácôM
Harakat-un laa-ta-hda√-u qurb-a l- masjid-i
non-stop motion/movement near the mosque

tu-ﬁTii li-l-siyaaHat-i maﬁnan xaaSS-an laa yu-mkin-u √inkaar-u-hu.
It gives to tourism an undeniably special meaning.
2.1.5 The negative imperative with laa ’
The negative imperative is formed by using laa plus the jussive form of the verb
in the second person (“you”).5
.∂n°ùØf  rèpYrõoJ ’
.nó©°üŸG  Ωpórînàr°ùnJ ’
laa tu-zﬁij nafs-a-ka.
laa ta-staxdim-i l-miSﬁad-a.
Don’t disturb yourself/don’t bother.
Don’t use the elevator.
2.1.6 The laa ’ of categorical or absolute negation: (laa al-naaﬁya li-l-jins ¢ùæé∏d á«aÉædG ’)
This is a special use of laa that negates the existence of something absolutely. The
particle laa precedes a noun which is in the accusative, but with no nunation

2.1.8 laa ’ as component of compound
Because of its ability to negate a noun or adjective directly, laa enters actively into
the formation of compound words that include concepts of negation. They
include both adjectives and nouns. For example,

2.2 Negation of the past
2.2.1 lam rºnd  jussive
The most common way to negate a past tense verb in written Arabic is to use the
negative particle lam followed by the verb in the jussive mood.
.päCÉnf  ⁄
.o¬nàqj ƒg oáWô°ûdG p∞o°ûrµnJ  ⁄

(‘[some]one did not die’)
2.2.2 maa Ée  past tense verb
This way of negating the past is rare in written Arabic, although it is widely used
in spoken Arabic vernaculars. The only instance of it that occurred in the database
was in a negation of a future perfect verb:
.náHÉàµdGh  nIAGô≤dG  o±pôr©nàn°S   rânfÉc  Ée
maa kaan-at sa-ta-ﬁrif-u l-qiraa√at-a wa-l-kitaabat-a.

2.2.3 lan rønd plus subjunctive to negate the future tense
To negate a proposition in the future the particle lan rønd is used followed by the
verb in the subjunctive mood.

2.2.4 Use of ghayr ôr«nZ ‘other than; non-’
The noun ghayr is used in three ways: as a noun plus pronoun suffix, as the first
term of a construct phrase with another noun, and as the first term of a descrip-
tive construct phrase whose second term is an adjective.
It conveys the idea of “otherness” or that something is different from some-
thing else.6
2.2.4.1 USE OF ghayr ôr«nZ PLUS PRONOUN SUFFIX: The pronoun suffix on ghayr ôr«nZ
reflects the number and gender of the noun or pronoun antecedent.

2.2.4.2 USE OF ghayr ôr«nZ AS FIRST TERM OF NOUN CONSTRUCT: Used as the first
term of a construct phrase or √iDaafa áaÉ°VEG, ghayr ôr«nZ carries the meaning of
‘other than.’
.ÉWÉ£ÑdGh  pºëq∏dG  nôr«nZ oπcCÉj ’

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
6 Cantarino 1975 (II:147–53) provides an extensive analysis of ghayr ôr«nZ and its usage in literary
Arabic. See also Wright 1967, II:208–209.

2.2.4.3 ghayr ôr«nZ  ADJECTIVE: ‘NON-; IN-; UN-; OTHER THAN; -LESS’: In this
construction, the noun ghayr ‘non-; un-, in-, other than’ is used as the first term
of a construct phrase or √iDaafa áaÉ°VEG in order to express negative or privative
concepts denoting absence of a quality or attribute. The second term of this kind
of construct phrase is an adjective. As the first term of a construct, ghayr ôr«nZ
carries the same case as the noun it modifies. As a noun which is the first term
of an √iDaafa, it cannot have the definite article.
The second term of the √iDaafa construction is an adjective or participle in the
genitive case which agrees with the noun being modified in gender, number, and
definiteness. Therefore, it is the second term of this descriptive construct that
shows agreement with the modified noun.7 Here are some examples:8

as the first term of a genitive construct to create a compound lexical item equiv-
alent to various kinds of privative or negative expressions. Although the

3 Exceptive expressions
This category of expressions includes connectives and adverbs with meanings
that contrast with previous propositional content. It includes items that have
meanings such as “except for,” “however,” “nevertheless√” and “despite; in spite
of.” Sometimes these items consist of one word, other times they are phrases.
They are also referred to as “adversative” expressions.

3.1 bal rπnH : ‘but; rather; but rather’
This word introduces a subordinate clause that contrasts in meaning with the
main clause.10 The verb in the main clause is normally negative, with bal intro-
ducing a contrary affirmation.

3.2 √illaa q’pEG: ‘except; but; but for’
This is a frequently used exceptive word in modern written Arabic. Its effect on
the following phrase varies depending on whether the main clause is a negative
or positive assertion.
3.2.1 Afﬁrmative clause  √illaa q’pEG
When the main clause is affirmative and √illaa introduces an exception to that
statement, it is followed by a noun in the accusative.

3.2.2 Negative clause + √illaa q’pEG
When the main clause is negative, √illaa q’pEG is followed by a noun that takes what-
ever case its role in the sentence requires. That is, √illaaq’pEG has no grammatical effect
on the noun. In the following sentences, for example, the noun phrase after √illaa q’pEG
fills the logical role of subject of the verb and is therefore in the nominative case.11

11 It is interesting to note that verb-subject gender agreement does not extend across √illaa back to the
verb. Although the logical subject in all these cases is feminine singular, the verb is masculine singular.

either a noun in the accusative case, or else a suffixed pronoun. In the following
sentences, √illaa √anna is the initial element, relating the sentence to one that

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

1 Introduction
The concept of passive meaning contrasted with active meaning is referred to as
voice in Western grammatical terms. That is, a verb is either in the active voice or the
passive voice. In general, when in the active voice, the doer of the action is the sub-
ject of the verb (‘We studied the problem’ daras-naa l-mushkilat-aná∏µ°ûŸG  Éær°SnQnO); when
a verb is in the passive, the entity affected by the action (the direct object of the
verb) becomes the subject (‘The problem was studied’ duris-at-i l-mushkilat-u
oá∏µ°ûŸG  ân°SpQoO). The voice of a verb therefore conveys information on the topical
focus of a sentence.
1.1 Two types of Arabic passive: inﬂectional and derivational
There are two basic ways to convey a passive meaning in Arabic, the first being
an inflectional (or internal) passive, involving a shift of vowel pattern within
the verb: e.g., ﬁuqid-a nóp≤oY‘it was held’ from ﬁaqad-a nón≤nY ‘he held,’ and the second
a derivational passive, where a derivational verb form (typically V, VII, or VIII )
is used to convey a passive, reflexive, or mediopassive sense of the action
involved in the verb (e.g., Form VII inﬁaqad-a nón≤n©rfpG ‘it was held’).1 The type of
action denoted by the derivational passive is referred to in Arabic as muTaawaﬁa
áYhÉ£e ‘obedience, conformity’ because it reflects a resultative state of the
object (fataH-tu l-baab-a fa-nfataH-a nínànØfÉa nÜÉÑdG oârënàna ‘I opened the door and it
opened’).2
657

Passive and passive-type expressions
1 As Wright notes (1967, I:51): “The idea of the passive voice must not be thought to be absolutely
identical with that of the fifth, seventh, and eighth forms. These are, strictly speaking effective
[or resultative-KCR] . . . whilst the other is purely passive” (Italics in original). In English,
however, it is sometimes necessary to render the equivalent meaning of these derived forms in
the passive.
2 Terminology for the passive: The passive voice, especially the inflectional passive ( fuﬁil-anπp©oa), is 
referred to in Arabic as the “unknown” al-majhuul ∫ ƒ¡ÛG, indicating that the agent or doer of
the action is not known. When a passive-like or mediopassive meaning is conveyed by a derived
form of the verb, it is characterized as muTaawiﬁ´hÉ£e or, literally, ‘obedient’ to an action that
has occurred (e.g., infataH-a íàØfG ‘it opened’).

1.2 Use of the inﬂectional passive
Generally speaking, the inflectional passive is used in Arabic only if the agent or
doer of the action is non-designated, unknown, or not to be mentioned for some
reason. This contrasts with English where one may readily mention the agent in a
passive construction through use of the preposition ‘by’ (‘The problem was studied
by us’).3
1.3 Contrast between active and passive voice
When the Arabic passive voice is used the object of the action is the subject of
the verb. The object of the action in the passive is therefore in the nominative
case. Note that an essential requirement for a verb to take a passive form is that it
must be a transitive verb, i.e., one that takes an object.4
If active-verb sentences are rephrased as passive constructions, the object of the
verb becomes the subject of the sentence, and the verb is marked for passive by
virtue of a change in the internal vowels. The doer of the action is normally not
mentioned.

.¬oàrënàna
.nípàoa

In the derivational passive, or resultative, a particular form of the verb is used
to convey passive meaning. Here, it is Form VII:
.oÜÉÑdG nínànØrfG
.nínànØrfG
infataH-a l-baab-u. 
infataH-a.
The door opened.

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic
3 Wright states: “the passive is especially used in four cases; namely (a) when God or some higher
being, is indicated as the author of the act; (b) when the author is unknown, or at least not known
for certain; (c) when the speaker or writer does not wish to name him; (d) when the attention of
the hearer or reader is directed more to the person affected by the act (patiens, the patient), than
to the doer of it (agens, the agent)” 1967, I:50.
4 The term that Arab grammarians use for “transitive verbs” is √afﬁaal mutaﬁaddiya ájqó©àe ∫É©aCG,
derived from the Form V verb taﬁaddaa ‘to go beyond, exceed.’ That is, the action of the verb
extends beyond the agent and all the way to the object. For intransitive verbs, the Arabic term is
either √a fﬁaal ghayr mutaﬁaddiya ájqó©àe ÒZ ∫É©aCG or √afﬁaal laazima áeR’ ∫É©aCG, verbs whose action
does not extend beyond the subject.

Sometimes Arabic inflectional and derivational passives exist side by side;
other times one is preferred. Moreover, they may carry slightly different implica-
tions about how the action was accomplished (see below).
1.4 Syntax: Restriction on mention of agent
When a passive verb is used in Arabic, mention of the identity of the agent or doer
of the action is usually omitted.5 It may be unknown or simply unnecessary. For
this reason, a term used to refer to the passive in Arabic is al-majhuul ∫ ƒ¡ÛG ‘the
unknown.’ In fact, if the agent is to be mentioned, the passive is not normally
used; the active verb is then the preferred option.6
However, instruments or other inanimate causative factors (such as the
weather) may be mentioned by means of prepositional phrases, e.g.,
.ìÉàØŸG  Gò¡pH oÜÉÑdG nípàoa
futiH-a l-baab-u bi-haadhaa l-miftaaH-i.
The door was opened by/with this key.
When the subject of the passive verb is mentioned as a separate noun, it is in
the nominative case (as in the sentence above, al-baab-u oÜÉÑdG ). The technical
Arabic term for the subject of a passive verb is naa√ib al-faaﬁil πYÉØdG ÖFÉf ‘the
deputy doer; the representative of the doer.’7
Note that the passive verb may occur in the present or past tense, and in the
indicative, jussive or subjunctive moods, depending on context.
2 The internal or inﬂectional passive
The internal passive is formed by changing the vowel sequence of the verb in the
following ways:
2.1 Past tense
In the past or perfect tense, the vowel sequence is /-u -i-/. That is, within the stem,
all vowels previous to the stem vowel are /u/ and the stem vowel itself is /i/. This is
true for all verb forms (derivations), and for quadriliteral verbs as well as triliteral
verbs. Aside from the internal vowel change, the past tense verb in the passive
conjugates as usual, with the normal suffixes:
Passive and passive-type expressions
659
5 Another term used to describe the passive verb in Arabic is maa lam yu-samma faaﬁil-u-hu ‘that
whose agent is not named.’ See Wright 1967, I:50–51 for more on terminology and section 2.5 in
this chapter.
6 As Cowan notes (1964, 59): “If the agent is mentioned in the sentence one cannot use the passive”
(emphasis in original). This rule is occasionally, but only rarely, broken in MSA.
7 On the syntax of passive verbs in literary Arabic, see Cantarino 1974, I:52–58.

When a concept is conveyed by a verb-preposition idiom, the verb remains in the
third person masculine singular in the passive. It does not inflect for agreement

masculine singular. In the following illustrations, an active sentence using a verb-
preposition idiom is changed to passive.

2.5 Mention of agent: ﬁalaa yad-i pónj  ≈∏nY, min qibal-i pπnÑpb  røpe
Rarely, an agent or doer of the action may be mentioned in an Arabic passive

would use the term “by.” These are ﬁalaa yad-i pónj  ≈∏Y  noun ‘by the hand of’ or
min qibal-i pπnÑpb  røpe  noun ‘on the part of.’

2.6 Passive with potential meaning
The Arabic passive is sometimes used to indicate possibility, worth, or potential.
The passive participle in particular may have a meaning equivalent to an English
adjective ending in “-able.”

passive-like meaning, and may sometimes be used in this way. However, this is not
always the case. These derivational verbs need to be learned as separate lexical

3.1 The Form V verb: tafaﬁﬁal-a / ya-tafaﬁﬁal-u oπs©Ønànj / πs©nØnJ
Form V verbs may function as the reflexive of the Form II verb. This is sometimes
referred to by grammarians as “mediopassive.”10 Form V may also be resultative of
Form II, showing the result of the Form II action, e.g., kassar-tu-haa fa-takassar-at

3.2 The Form VII verb: infaﬁal-a/ya-nfaﬁil-u oπp©nØrænj / nπn©nØrfpG
The Form VII verb may be analyzed as ergative, that is, the subject of the Form VII
verb is the same as the object of the transitive Form I verb.12 Form VII verbs are
also referred to as reflexive, resultative, passive or mediopassive in meaning. In
Arabic they are described as muTaawiﬁ‘obeying, corresponding with’ – that is,
Form VII verbs show the result of Form I action.13

10 “No grammatical distinction is made in Arabic verbs between “reflexive” acts and spontaneous
developments – what one does to one’s self and what simply happens to one are equally accommo-
dated by the mediopassive” (Cowell 1964, 238).
11 For more on the Form V verb and its meanings, see Chapter 26.
12 Ergative verbs are sometimes referred to as “unaccusative” verbs, especially in relational grammar.
See Crystal 1997, 138–39 and Mahmoud 1991.
13 For more on muTaawiﬁ´hÉ£e see section 1.1 in this chapter and also Chapter 26, note 4.
14 One reason for the existence of mediopassive verbs in Form VIII is the phonological restriction in
Form VII against lexical roots beginning with the consonants hamza, waaw, yaa√, raa√, laam, or
nuun. Form VIII or Form V take over the mediopassive function for those roots.

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

Conditional propositions are ones in which hypothetical conditions are specified
in order for something else to take place. Usually there are two clauses, one that
specifies the condition (typically starting with “if . . .”) and one that specifies the
consequences or result of those conditions (typically starting with “then . . .”). In
traditional English grammar the clause that specifies the conditions (the “if-
clause”) is termed the protasis and the second clause (the “then-clause”) is termed
the apodosis. In Arabic the equivalent terms are sharT •ô°T (for the condition
clause) and jawaab ÜGƒL (for the consequence clause).
Arabic often uses a past tense verb in the conditional clause or protasis (sharT
•ô°T). However, the jussive mood of the present tense verb may also be used in the
protasis. The apodosis or consequence clause (jawaab ÜGƒL) may be in the same
tense as the previous one, or it may be different. If there is a tense switch between
clauses, the particle fa- normally precedes the apodosis; in practice in current
MSA, however, it is often omitted.1
Some conditions are reasonably realizable (“If you wait, I’ll go with you”), but
others are simply expressions of impossible or “contrary to fact” conditions (“If I
were your fairy godmother, I would grant your wish”). Arabic uses different par-
ticles to express possible conditions and impossible conditions.2
1 Possible conditions: idhaa GPEG and √in r¿EG
To express possible conditions, Arabic uses two conditional particles: √idhaa or √in
to start the protasis or sharT conditional clause. In the texts covered for this study,
√idhaa occurred much more frequently than √in.3 The use of √idhaa is considered to
imply probable conditions.4
671

Conditional and optative expressions
1 See Taha 1995, 180–82 on this topic.
2 For a book-length description of conditional structures in Arabic, see Peled 1992, which contains
an extensive bibliography on the topic as well. See also Cantarino 1975, III: 311–69, Blachère and
Gaudefroy-Demombynes 1975, 450–68, and Fischer 2002, 227–36 for discussion of conditional
structures in classical and literary Arabic.
3 Note that √idhaa does not always translate as ‘if.’ Sometimes it is used in the adverbial sense of
‘when.’ See Cantarino 1975, III:297–302.
4 “√in is a straight hypothesis – ‘if, if it is the case that . . ., if it should be that . . .’ while √idhaa ‘if ’
implies some degree of probability and sometimes implies ‘when, whenever.’” Abboud and McCarus
1983, Part 2:176.

1.1 √idhaa GPEG ‘if’  past tense
When √idhaa is used as the conditional particle in the sharT clause, the verb is in
the past tense. In the jawaab, a tense switch may or may not happen. This type of
conditional is the most frequent in MSA.
.πØ°SC’G ¤EG  ´ô¡J ’ ,áqjƒ∏©dG ≥HGƒ£dG ‘  nâæc GPEG

If you want to reserve a ticket, (then) you must pay in advance.
1.1.1 Negative conditional: √idhaa lam r⁄ GPEG
A negative condition may be expressed with lam  jussive verb.
.¬∏gÉéàj ¬qfEÉa...¿ƒfÉ≤dG p≠∏j  ⁄ GPEG
idhaa lam ya-lghi l-qaanuun-a . . . fa-√inna-hu ya-tajaahal-u-hu.
[Even] if he hasn’t abolished the law . . . he ignores it.
1.1.2 Negative conditional wa-√illaa . . . fa- ‘if not; or else’
Another type of negative condition is expressed through the used of wa-√illaa
(a contraction of wa-√in-laa), which introduces a consequence clause. Sometimes
it is accompanied by fa- :
ÉgQhO ‘ â∏°ûa ¿ƒµà°ù`a ,’EG h
wa-√illaa, fa-sa-ta-kuun-u fashal-at fii dawr-i-haa

.∑ƒ°ü°UÉb q’EG h ô°†ÿG πc
kul-i l-xuDar-a wa-√illaa qaaSaS-uu-ka. 
Eat the vegetables or else they [will] punish you.
1.1.3 Reversal of clause order
Most of the time, the sharT clause comes first, before the jawaab or apodosis, but
sometimes the order is reversed. This is referred to as a “postposed condition,”
and the normal rules for the result clause do not apply. The particle fa- is omitted
and the verb in the first clause may vary as to tense.

participate.
1.2 Conditional with √in + perfect or √in + jussive
The conditional particle /√in/ may be followed by either verbs in the perfect or
verbs in the jussive in both the condition and the result clauses. If the jussive
is used in the conditional clause, then the verb in the result clause may also be
jussive.5 For this reason, the particle /√in/ is called in Arabic grammar one of the
“particles that require the jussive on two verbs”: al-√adawaat-u llatii ta-jzim-u
fiﬁl-ayni Ú∏©a ΩõŒ »àdG äGhOC’G. If, however, the verb in the result clause is part
of a nominal clause (i.e., a clause that starts with a noun), then it is in the
imperfect indicative.6 The verb in the result clause may also be in the past
tense.
The use of √in with conditional clauses is less frequent in Modern Standard Ara-
bic than in literary and classical Arabic.

5 See Abboud and McCarus 1983, Part 2:178: “If the verb in the condition clause is jussive, the verb
in the result clause must also be jussive.” See also ﬁAbd al-Latif et al., 1997, 307ff. for more exam-
ples.  But note that in Haywood and Nahmad 1962, 291, they list under possibilities for the condi-
tional sentence: “The Jussive is used in the Protasis, the Perfect in the Apodosis:

The condition clause may also be in the imperative, without a conditional particle, and followed

lowing example (Part 2:178):

2 Conditional expressed with -maa Ée ‘ever’
The adverbial suffix -maa can be suffixed to an adverb or a noun to shift its mean-
ing to ‘-ever,’ such as “whenever” or “wherever.” These expressions are considered
conditionals in Arabic and follow the rules for conditional sentences. Cowell 1964
refers to clauses using these particles as “quasi-conditional” clauses.10

with similar particles.

2.3 kull-a-maa Éªq∏c ‘whenever’
This connective also specifies a condition and therefore requires the use of the
past tense verb in the clause that it introduces.

2.4 √idhaa + maa Ée GPEG ‘if ever’
Occasionally, even √idhaa will be followed by the particle -maa. In this sense, -maa
is not used as a negative particle but implies ‘if ever’ or ‘if and when.’
QGƒ◊G ÜÉH íàoa  Ée GPEG
√idhaa-maa futiH-a baab-u l-Hiwaar-i

2.5 man røne ‘whoever’
The pronoun man, meaning ‘who’ or ‘whoever’ may be followed by a conditional
clause in the jussive. This kind of conditional is often found in proverbs.
.kÉcƒ°T  ó°üëj kÉcƒ°T  ´Qõj   øe
man ya-zraﬁshawk-an ya-HSid shawk-an.11
He who sows thorns [will] reap thorns.
.πà≤oj  πà≤j  øe
man ya-qtul yu-qtal.12
He who kills, shall be killed.
3. Contrary-to-fact conditionals: la- n`d law rƒnd
Some conditional sentences express impossible or unreasonable conditions. The
conditional particle used to introduce contrary-to-fact conditions is law rƒnd, fol-
lowed by either a past tense verb or lam plus the jussive for the negative. The con-
trary-to-fact condition is usually followed by a result clause (jawaab) that is pre-
ceded by the particle la- n`d; there are some exceptions, however. The la- n`d is
omitted when the result clause precedes the condition clause as in:
.äQÉW  ƒdh IõæY
ﬁanzat-un wa-law Taar-at.

4 Optative constructions
Wishes, blessings, and curses are often expressed in the past tense in Arabic, just
as the past tense is used in many hypothetical expressions. There is no need for a
particular particle, just the expression phrased in the past tense.

A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

Using an Arabic dictionary
The organization of Arabic dictionaries is based on word roots and not word
spelling. Word roots are listed alphabetically according to the order of letters in
the Arabic alphabet. For example, the root k-t-f comes after k-t-b because /f / comes
after /b / in the Arabic alphabet. Therefore, in order to find the root, one has to
know the order of the alphabet. This system applies to genuinely Arabic words or
words that have been thoroughly Arabized. 
Loanwords, however, — words borrowed from other languages — are listed in an
Arabic dictionary according to their spelling (e.g., haliikubtar ÎÑµ«∏g ‘helicopter’).
Instead of relying on the exact orthography of a word, therefore, Arabic dic-
tionaries are organized by the root or consonant core of a word, providing under
that initial entry every word derived from that particular root. The root is there-
fore often called a “lexical root” because it is the actual foundation for the
lexicon, or dictionary. The lexical root provides a semantic field within which
actual vocabulary items can be located. In this respect, an Arabic dictionary
might be seen as closer to a thesaurus than a dictionary, locating all possible
variations of meaning in one referential domain or semantic field under one
entry.
Most often, Arabic words can be reduced to three radicals or root consonants
(e.g., H-m-l ‘carry’), but some roots have more or less than three. There are a
number of biliteral (y-d ‘hand’), quadriliteral (t-r-j-m ‘translate’), and quinquiliteral
(b-n-f-s-j ‘violet’) roots in Arabic, and there are even some monoliteral roots (for
function words such as the preposition ka- ‘as, like’).
The verb citation form for dictionary use is the third person masculine singu-
lar past tense. There is no infinitive form of the verb in Arabic. 
For example, all the following words having to do with “studying” are found in
the dictionary under the root d-r-s, even though some begin with ma- or mu-,
because all of them are located within the semantic field of d-r-s.

Because of this major difference in dictionary organization, it is necessary for
Western learners of Arabic to learn rules of Arabic word structure in order to be
able to make sense of an Arabic or Arabic–English dictionary. Learners must be
able to identify the root consonants in a word in order to find the main diction-
ary entry; then they need to know generally how the word pattern fits into the
overall system of derivational morphology in order to locate that particular word
within the abundant and sometimes extensive subcategories provided within the
semantic field of the entry. The root-pattern system is fundamental for Arabic
word creation and accounts for about 80–85 percent of Arabic vocabulary.
Using the Wehr Dictionary
In the most widely used Arabic–English dictionary, the Dictionary of Modern Written
Arabic (DMWA) by Hans Wehr and edited by J. Milton Cowan, fourth edition (1979),
the compilers assume that the users know and understand the system of Arabic
derivational verb morphology based on the roman numerals I–X (or sometimes
even up to XV). Wehr lists verbs first, in the I–X order, marked only by the roman
numeral, not giving the actual verb spelling except for Form I.1
For example, under the root q-b-l, are listed roman numerals II, III, IV, V, VI, VIII,
and X, and after each roman numeral are definitions for each of these forms of
the verb. Thus, if the user is looking up an inflected verb form, such as istaqbal-
at, the user needs to know that this is a Form X verb, that the root is q-b-l, and that
it is inflected for third person feminine singular past tense. In this manner, the
user can locate the verb root, find the roman numeral X and see that the listed
definitions for this form include ‘to face, to meet, to receive.’ By putting together
the lexical meaning from the dictionary information, contextual meaning from
the text being read, and the grammatical meaning from the inflectional suffix,
the user can deduce that the word istaqbal-at means ‘she received.’
Note that the DMWA provides the present tense or imperfective stem vowel for
Form I because it is not predictable. It does not do this for the derived forms,
because they are predictable. It therefore includes, in romanization, after the
Arabic script, under the entry for k-t-b, for example:
kataba
u (katb, kitba, kitaaba)
678
Appendix I
1 Wehr provides a useful summary of the arrangement of entries in his introduction (1979, pp.
vii–xvii).

That is, it gives the voweling for the past tense citation form, the present tense
stem vowel, and, in parentheses, the most common verbal nouns for the Form I
verb, all in romanization. The DMWA does not include short vowels in the Arabic
script spelling of the entries; short vowels are indicated only by the romanization
that directly follows the dictionary entry.
To look up the word istiqbaal ∫ÉÑr≤pàr°SpG, it is helpful to know that it is a verbal
noun of Form X, since the DMWA lists nouns (including nouns of place and nouns
of instrument, for example), adjectives, adverbs, and verbal nouns immediately
after the verb definitions, in the I–X order. After that are listed active participles
I–X and then passive participles, also in the I–X order. Note, however, that the
DMWA does not identify the nouns or participles by number; it assumes that the
user knows the derivational system. 
It is also important for users to be able to recognize noun, adjective, and par-
ticiple plurals because plurals are not listed as separate items in the dictionary,
even though their word structure may differ substantially from the singular
form, especially with broken plurals. Thus, coming across a word such as
mashaakil πcÉ°ûe, the reader needs to know how to determine the root, sh-k-l, but
also needs to recognize that this is a broken plural pattern, and will not be listed
as a separate entry, but as a plural under the entry of mushkila á∏µ°ûe, ‘problem’ (a
Form IV active participle). 
Particular challenges emerge when lexical roots are weak or irregular in some
way, that is, if they are geminate, hamzated, assimilated, hollow, defective, or
doubly defective. In these cases, the nature of a root consonant may shift (from a
long vowel to a hamza, for example as in the word zaa√ir ôFGR ‘visitor’ derived from
the root z-w-r) or a root consonant may simply disappear (for example, the noun
thiqa ‘trust, confidence’ from the root w-th-q). It is therefore crucial for learners to
practice using the dictionary and to gain an understanding of the system of Ara-
bic word structure in order to have quick and efficient access to vocabulary items.
Having a knowledge of the basic derivational systems and the logic and rules
within these systems is key to building vocabulary and to gaining access to the
full range of the abundant Arabic lexicon.
Naturally, it is not possible for learners at the early stages to recognize all pos-
sible root variants, but understanding the logic of dictionary organization will
help right from the beginning. While it is possible to simply scour all the entries
under a particular root without knowing the I–X system or the part-of-speech
information that tells one where to look, it takes a great deal more time, and can
be very frustrating, if not defeating.
This reference grammar includes extensive analysis of the permutations of
regular and irregular lexical roots, in the I–X system. Please consult these
sections for analysis of word structure, paradigms, and examples of words in
context.
How to use an Arabic dictionary
679

Thus, to summarize, the DMWA lists entries for a lexical root in the following
order:
1.
the root (which resembles the third person masculine singular past tense
Form I verb)
2.
verbal nouns of Form I (listed directly after the root in romanization)
3. verbs I–X listed numerically by roman numeral only
4. nouns and other parts of speech derived from Form I
5. nouns derived from other forms of the verb (in II–X sequence)
6. active participles from Forms I–X
7. passive participles from Forms I–X
Using an Arabic–Arabic dictionary
Arabic-Arabic dictionaries are likewise organized by lexical roots and the roots are
listed in alphabetical order. Note, however, that Arabic lexicons do not use the I–X
roman numeral system and make no reference to it. 
For example, a standard reference work in Arabic is al-Munjid fii l-lugha wa-l-
√aﬁlaam, a combination of dictionary and concise encyclopedia. In the dictionary
part, it lists verb derivations in the I–X order by listing them as they are spelled. 
It also introduces verbal nouns, especially of Form I, in context, used in a short
sentence, for example:
.nÜÉàµdG  káHÉàch  kánÑràpch  kÉHÉàch  ÉÑrànc nÖnànc
katab-a katb-an wa-kitaab-an wa-kitbat-an wa-kitaabat-an-i l-kitaab-a.
Literally: ‘He wrote writing and writing and writing and writing the book.’
It is standard practice in Arabic reference works to use the verbal noun/s in a
sentence with the verb in order to illustrate what they are (even though the exam-
ple might not make logical sense). In the above example, there are four different
verbal nouns displayed in boldface type. 
This procedure is used with Form I verbs, but the verbal nouns of the derived
forms II–X are not separately indicated because they are predictable. The al-Munjid
fii l-lugha wa-l-√aﬁlaam has an excellent introductory section summarizing Arabic
derivational and inflectional morphology (pp. haa√to faa√).
Arabic dictionary structure has evolved over time, and some older dictionar-
ies are organized in different ways.2 Note also that some modern Arabic dic-
tionaries are referred to as “√abjadiyy” or ‘alphabetical,’ meaning that their
680

Arabic root dictionaries and alphabetical dictionaries.

entries are organized by word spelling (for example, al-Munjid al-√abjadiyy, 1968).
Although this type of organization eases use somewhat for those who do not
understand the derivational system of Arabic word structure, it is much less use-
ful in helping the learner grasp semantic fields, word structure patterns, and
meaning relationships among lexical items.
