Attributes
1.
Instance (Object) Attributes
●
Unique data for each instance
●
It is created in the constructor (__init__( ) method) or in other instance methods
●
We access it using objectName.attributeName 
2. Class Attributes
●
Data shared by all instances, same value for all objects
●
It’s defined outside the methods, at the class level
●
We access it ClassName.attributeName or objectName.attributeName
●
Can be overwritten by an instance attribute
●
It’s the equivalent of a static variables from other programming languages (in Python 
there are no static variables explicitly defined)
