Writing for LFY 
I have been a regular reader of LINUX For You and love the 
content. I ensure that I do not miss out on any issue, whether it 
is the hard copy of the magazine or the soft version of it. The 
informative articles have strongly inspired me to write for LFY. 
Please let me know the procedure to get my articles published 
in your esteemed magazine. 
—Sahil Chelaramani
sahilc.2200@gmail.com
ED: We are indeed happy to know that you enjoy reading our 
articles. And your earnestness to contribute to LFY makes us 
even happier. Thanks a lot for your valuable feedback. Sahil, 
before  penning down an article for us, you need to send us 
a detailed Table of Contents (ToC) on the topics you wish to 
cover. Our editorial team will review the ToC and once they 
give you a thumbs up, you can go ahead with the article. 
We will forward you the editorial guidelines so that you can 
structure your articles taking a cue from them. Please let us 
know if you have any queries.  
A request to include topics on  
'embedded Linux technology'
I am a LFY subscriber. I have been working on embedded Linux 
and have always looked up to LFY as my lodestar. I have a 
request—could you please include topics on embedded Linux 
development for different platforms. It would be great if you 
share some content on topics like kernel porting, Bootloader, 
Toolchain and more. I am sure this will be a help to a lot of 
embedded Linux developers like me.
—Parthiv Shah
parthiv.shah@promptsoftech.com
ED: It gives us a great feeling to know that you religiouly follow 
LFY and refer to it as your guide. We welcome your suggestions. 
We will definitely try to publish some articles on the topic you’ve 
requested in our future editions. Kindly allow us a little time so 
that we can work on it. Please do feel free to reach out to us if 
you have any other query.
Need to check the binding of the magazine
Over the past few months, the binding of the LFY magazine 
has been coming apart even before the magazine is opened! 
Or else the postman or courier boy are reading the magazine 
before it is delivered, which I suspect is not the case. I am 
a big fan of LFY and this is the third consecutive year that I 
have subscribed to the magazine. I keep the magazine with 
me for a long time. The first issue that I subscribed to is still 
in my cupboard. So, this is a sincere request to you to do the 
needful regarding the quality of the binding.
—Dharmit Shah
shahdharmit@gmail.com 
ED: Thanks for the alert. We will surely check our production 
quality at the press, and try and improve on it. Do let us know 
if you continue to experience the same problem in future. I also 
hope you have accessed the FREE e-zine service available to 
LFY subscribers, by which you can access all issues (over the 
Net) that you have subscribed to. 
It also makes us feel good that you’ve been preserving the 
back issues of LFY. Thanks to the patronage of readers like you, 
we will be able to build an even bigger base of loyal readers.
Lalit Irom: How can I get previous editions  
of LFY?.
LINUX For You: Thanks for the query. 
To read our previous issues, you can 
check the details on http://ezines.
efyindia.com/. Please let us know if 
you have any further queries.
Damanjeet Singh: I have more than 10 years of 
experience in Linux. I would like to share my 
experiences with the open source community 
through your magazine. Please let me know 
how I should go about it.
LINUX For You: It’s great to hear about 
your interest in writing for LFY. You can 
shoot a mail to lfyedit@efyindia.com, 
briefly describing your work profile. We 
can take it further from there.

Tulsi Raj: bashrc is per user based profile for 
all users. For example, user1 creates an alias 
and saves it to bashrc.  Other users cannot use 
this alias. If u create an alias and save it to your 
profile, all users get an alias.
Murali Krishna Reddy: Is it possible to create 
alias for users?
Tulsi Raj: Yes, Goto the user login and put alias 
ls=ls -ltr & put it to the ~/.bashrc file.

Ankur Lathwal:
Hey friends, I need some career-related advice 
from you all. Currently,I am doing my BTech in 
Computer Science from MDU, Rohtak ,Haryana.
The college is not good in terms of placements & 
even the campus life is boring. Nor there is fun and 
neither there is proper education. I have completed 
my 1st year and have applied for migration to a 
college affiliated to GGSIPU,New Delhi in Delhi.
This college has very good placement records. But 
due to lack of vacant seats in Computer Science,I 
might get IT (Information Technology) stream there. 
I joined engineering only to become a programmer 
& with a dream of working in big companies like 
Google,Microsoft,etc. Now I am afraid that with 
IT stream, I might end up getting different type 
of jobs in IT companies. My query is what's the 
difference in CSE & IT & with my current career 
aspirations,should i take up IT or not?
Like . comment
Godfrey J Lawrence: You dont have to worry 
about your UG stream if you want to become a 
programmer.! If programming is your passion, 
you can follow it irrespective of your spe-
cialisation ! In Indian IT MNCs, BTech's from all 
streams are working as programmers.

Jabra, a brand owned by GN Netcom, 
has introduced a highly sophisticated 
Bluetooth headset that can connect 
you to your PC as well as your 
mobile phone and tablet. With Active 
Noise Cancellation technology, Jabra 
Supreme UCTM supports Unified 
Communication (UC) applications 
like Microsoft Lync, CISCO, 
Microsoft Office Communicator, 
Avaya Dev Connect and more. The 
headset supports all mobile, tablet and 
computer operating systems. 
One of the unique features of 
this headset is that it supports voice 
commands. You can connect up to 
eight phones or Bluetooth enabled 
devices like laptops, tablets and 
conduct conference calls. The headset 
will notify the user by speaking out 
the name of the active device, which 
is ringing. You can hold one call and 
accept another call by simply giving 
voice commands. 
The nano Bluetooth USB adapter 
that comes with the headset can be 
plugged to the USB port, which makes 
it possible to connect to PCs and use 
the headset for Internet calls. 
With noise cancellation and audio 
enhancement, the headset lowers 
the level of surrounding sounds and 
amplifies the voice of the user.

to buy the HTC Desire VC smartphone along with a new 
Tata Docomo post-paid connection, will get double talk time on the Diet 199 Plan

data per month for six months, an online report reveals.
The HTC Desire VC runs Android Ice Cream Sandwich with the HTC Sense 
4.0 user interface. The smartphone features a 10.16-cm (4-inch) touchscreen display 
along with a 5 mega-pixel auto focus camera with flash. Other specifications include 
4 GB of internal memory, which can be expanded up to 32 GB, a 1 GHz Cortex-A5

Samsung is Numero Uno in smartphones 
It has been a battle royal for the giant smartphone rivals all this while. Six 
months after losing the top position in the 
smartphone market to Apple, Samsung regained 
leadership in the second quarter this year, as 
its sales rose 5 per cent to 36 million units, up 
from 34 million in the first quarter. Meanwhile, Apple suffered a 26 per cent 
decline in shipments to 26 million units, down from 35 million in the first 
quarter. Samsung's modest increase was propelled by strong growth in high-end 
smartphone shipments. 
Apple's shipments in the second quarter were impacted by a combination of 
factors, including macroeconomic variables, increased competition from new 
smartphone offerings and delayed purchasing among consumers who are waiting for 
the next iPhone model. All this led to a build-up of channel inventory, resulting in 
lower-than-expected iPhone sales.
While the other smartphone companies disclose exact shipment numbers for 
overall cell phone and smartphone sales, Samsung does not provide precise figures, 
instead offering general guidance. Because of this, the Samsung cell phone and 
smartphone shipment numbers indicated here are estimated, and may differ from the 
interpretations of others.
Near field communication: A potential threat to Android!   
 Near field communication (NFC), a new radio communications technology, 
which connects similar smartphones when they are touched or brought close to 
each other, is already in use in several high end smartphones. This could be a 
potential threat to Android and Nokia phones.
Charlie Miller, a security specialist at the Black Hat information security 
conference in Las Vegas, used NFC to transfer malicious code to different 
smartphones without interacting with the smartphone owner.
Miller studied the process of infecting phones via NFC for about nine months, 
and focused on applications that use the radio interface like Google's Beam. The 
demonstration also revealed that a majority of  Android devices are outdated and are 
very vulnerable to this bug, which can infect devices without any user interactions, 
but by using NFC technology.
With the ever expanding horizons of technology, data security remains 
a prime concern that needs to be addressed before deploying a large scale 
technological solution. 
Steam for Linux games ‘unethical’: Stallman
Linux enthusiasts all over the world are happy about the 
games company, Steam, warming up to Linux, but it has 
not impressed the founder of GNU. Richard Stallman 
has expressed his concerns on his blog. Stallman said 
that while the availability of popular non-free programs 
on GNU/Linux can boost adoption of the system, it may 
not bring enough freedom. He writes: “However, our 
goal goes beyond making this system a ‘success’; its purpose is to bring freedom to 
the users. Thus, the question is how this development affects users' freedom.”
Huawei introduces  
USB dongles 
Mobile data cards and USB sticks 
are gaining popularity rapidly 
in India as laptop and tablet 
usage is heading north. One of 
the key difficulties faced by 
consumers while shifting from 
one Internet service provider to 
another is unlocking their USB 
dongles. Huawei Devices-India, 
which makes dongles for telcos 
like Airtel, Reliance, MTS and 
Tata Photon, has addressed this 
problem by introducing the range 
of open market USB dongles, 
which can connect you to the 
Internet, irrespective 
of your service 
provider.
Huawei has 
recently launched the 
E303 Hi-Link USB dongle 
and the E355 Wi-Fi dongle that can 
provide Internet connection to five 
users at a time. The E303 Hi-Link is 
priced at Rs 2,199, while the E355 
Wi-Fi dongle is available at Rs 5,499.
Huawei HiLink claims to be 
the world's most advanced data 
card technology till date with 
multiple Huawei patents. It can 
connect users automatically to 
the Internet within 15 seconds 
after the datacard is inserted 
into the USB port, without 
the need for a tedious dial-in 
process, driver installation or 
manual configuration, boasts the 
company. Users can also store 
data up to 32 GB via a MicroSD 
card in the dongle, as a card slot 
is provided.

He also added that non-free game programs (like other non-free programs) 
are unethical because they deny freedom to their users. (Game art is a different 
issue, because it isn't software.) If you want freedom, one requisite for it is not 
having non-free programs on your computer. That much is clear. However, if 
you're going to use these games, you're better off using them on GNU/Linux 
rather than on Microsoft Windows.
Stallman thinks that Steam's move might do both harm and good. It could 
encourage GNU/Linux users to install these games, and it might encourage 
users of the games to replace Windows with GNU/Linux. While Stallman thinks 
that the direct positive effect will be larger than the direct harm, it will teach bad 
things to little outsourcers.
The Linux guru also added that if hardline open sourcers want to promote 
freedom, they should not talk about the availability of these games on GNU/
Linux as supporting their cause.
Torvalds releases Linux 3.5 Kernel     
For all those Linux lovers, the wait is finally over! The Linux 3.5 Kernel has 
been released by Linus Torvalds. The fully furnished kernel with better support 
for hybrid graphics and new tools for performance monitoring is now available. 
One of the major updates in the RC 7 includes patches for the Leap Second 
bug that caused Linux systems to freeze because of permanent high CPU loads, 
which resulted in increased power consumption.
With a new version of X Server, the new kernel will deliver improved hybrid 
graphics support along with a variety of new and revised drivers, including support 
for ‘FireWire Target Disk Mode’. The main difference for home PC users as well as 
professional systems administrators would be Prime infrastructure and Uprobes.
A new filter mechanism for Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) has been added 
in this kernel, which would enable programs to set up filters. Also, an enhanced 
infrastructure feature improves the security of Linux Containers (LXC).
Lenovo to release Ideapad K1 tablet
While people are eyeing Google’s latest Android Jelly Bean, here comes 
some news from ICS land. Lenovo is finally releasing an Android Ice Cream 
Sandwich update for the Ideapad K1 tablet. The 23.3-cm (10-inch) tablet was 
launched by Lenovo running the Android 
Honeycomb 3.0 operating system last year. 
And the device has been lagging behind in 
getting any sort of updates. 
The Ice Cream Sandwich update was 
expected in the first quarter of the year but the 
company delayed it.
The ICS update is available for the IdeaPad 
K1 via Lenovo forums. Moreover, it is not mandatory for users to upgrade their 
device to Android 4.0. Those not interested can continue with the Honeycomb 
version of Android on their tablet. 
This release is not a regular update. According to an online report, this release 
differs from the factory-installed Honeycomb 3.1 release and subsequent OTA (over 
the air) updates to Honeycomb 3.2, and it does not include Lenovo customisations 
such as the launcher, pre-installed apps, an app store, nor the underlying framework.
Dell brings out laptops with 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
Dell has rolled out two new high-end 
mobile workstations with Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL 6) for desktops.
The company claims that the two 
new systems, called the Dell Precision 
M4700 and M6700, are the world's most 
powerful 38.1-cm (15-inch) and 43.2-cm 
(17-inch) mobile workstations. Both the 
models sport the latest Intel Core i5, i7 and 
Extreme Edition processors with Turbo 
Boost Technology. They also come packed 
with a range of graphics cards including 
NVIDIA's Quadro K-series GPUS and 
AMD FirePro graphics. M6700, which 
is the top of the line, offers AMD FirePro 
M6000 with PCIe x16 Gen 3 for fast 
data throughput. The laptops offer high-
definition 1920x1080-pixel resolution.
The new laptops have three storage 
slots, which allow users to combine a 512 
GB solidstate drive, a 256 GB SSD and a 
750 GB hard drive. It is worth mentioning 
here that standard laptops offer 256 GB 
SSDs, but the new high-performance 
laptops like that of Apple's latest 39.1-cm 
(15.4-inch) MacBook Pro with Retina 
display are offered with 512 GB SSDs.
Jelly Bean for Motorola 
Xomm tablet
Here is a piece of good news for Motorola 
fans. The company is updating its Xoom 
Wi-Fi tablet to Android 4.1.1 a.k.a. Jelly 
Bean over the air. This update is only for 
the Wi-Fi version and Verizon users need 
not apply. Along with a new improved UI, 
Google's Project Butter has enhanced the 
entire Android experience in Jelly Bean. The 
search interface has got a new look and the 
voice search has been also enhanced to allow 
users to search their tablet in a better way.
The Notifications tray has got a 
completely new look and an improved 
keyboard makes text input faster, as it 
can smartly predict the next word.

Google tightens policy to tackle  
malicious Android apps   
 There are reports that almost 
every Android device is infected 
with malicious applications, as 
warned by British Telecom, which 
has come up with some eyebrow-
raising statements about the Android 
operating system. It seems Google 
has taken a note of this, and has changed the rules for applications on its 
Android mobile operating system in a bid to cut down on malicious apps.
The new policy changes for apps submitted to the Google Play 
application store include new rules on app naming, a ban on apps that 
disclose personal information without permission and more details on 
the payment policy.
It seems that Google is in no mood to destroy Android’s popularity and 
has sent strict instructions to app developers. Stricter controls on app names 
and icons have been introduced to eliminate copycat apps that attempt 
to trick users. According to a Tech Radar report, Google's new terms tell 
developers: "Don’t pretend to be someone else, and don’t represent that 
your application is authorised by or produced by another company or 
organisation, if that is not the case.” Also, developers are warned that apps 
that introduce security vulnerabilities or ‘harm user devices’ will not be 
permitted.
Google is also getting strict about spamming. It has set down new rules 
against apps that 'spam' users by delivering repetitive content or the ones 
that try to achieve better positions in the Google Play store by artificially 
boosting ratings. In a letter to app developers, the Android team wrote: “We 
are constantly striving to make Google Play a great community for developers 
and consumers. This requires us to update our policies when we launch new 
features, like subscription billing, and also when we see unhealthy behaviour, 
like deceptive app names and spammy notifications.”
Introducing Honeywell’s  
Android enterprise digital assistant   
Now, Honeywell has added Android to 
the enterprise digital assistant. The first 
to do so, it has introduced the Dolphin 
7800 Android handheld computer 
for sales representatives whose work 
involves multiple customer stops.
Honeywell Scanning & Mobility 
and Microsoft Corp also signed a 
patent agreement that provides broad coverage under Microsoft's patent 
portfolio for Honeywell's products running on the Android or Chrome OS 
platforms. The Dolphin 7800 Android offers better features to businesses that 
issue the device to their employees—it even has the ability to remotely secure 
a lost device. With Honeywell's Remote MasterMind 3.0 device management 
Android ICS in Raspberry Pi   
 The Raspberry Pi website has revealed an 
exciting update – the arrival of Android 
4.0. This is great news for Linux fans with 
a sweet tooth! According to the website, 
hardware-accelerated graphics and videos 
have been up and running smoothly for 
some time; AudioFlinger support is the 
only major missing piece at the moment.
Ice Cream Sandwich is definitely 
the flavour of this summer. The website 
further reads, “This implementation uses 
a different kernel and VideoCore binary 
image from the one available on GitHub, 
which is why we’ve been keeping quiet 
about it so far. We’re investigating the 
feasibility of converging the two code lines 
to produce a single common platform as 
soon as we can, at which point we hope to 
release the sources for you to play with.”
The Raspberry Pi is an ARM GNU 
Linux box or a mini computer built on 
a single board. Powered by an ARM 
processor on a Broadcom BCM2835 SoC, 
it has a 700 MHz processor, 256 MB of 
RAM and Video 4 GPU that allows the 
device to handle full HD video playback 
and even 40 MBps Blu-ray streams 
with ease. One of the two models has an 
Ethernet port and two USB ports, which 
allows users to connect external drives.
The Raspberry Pi is the most pocket 
friendly power packed device. About 4,000 
Raspberry Pis are being made every day, 
and one can buy it from RS Components, 
element14 or Premier Farnell.

software, businesses can also enrol and configure devices, track company assets 
and enforce strong password protection.
Honeywell has also launched a Developer Program for Android OS compatible 
devices, giving independent software vendors (ISVs) and end-users a voice in 
the development of Honeywell products that will use the Android OS. Program 
participants had the opportunity to develop and test Android-specific applications 
on Honeywell's newest mobile device, prior to launch.
More than 60 per cent of  
Android devices run Gingerbread!   
Despite the latest version of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean being 
launched by Google, more than 60 per cent of Android 
devices still continue to run the old but popular Android 
2.3 Gingerbread. The version 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich 
only has 16 per cent of the Android market share, while 
the latest flavour, Jelly Bean, accounts for only 0.8 per 
cent of all devices.
It's pretty interesting to see that Android 2.2 Froyo now accounts for 15.5 
per cent of all devices, compared to 17.3 per cent in June 2012 and the version 
2.1 Eclair is down to 4.2 per cent. Devices running 1.5 (Cupcake), 1.6 (Donut), 
and Android 3.x Honeycomb tablets come in at 0.2 per cent, 0.5 per cent and 
2.3 per cent, respectively.
Ice Cream Sandwich is slowly gaining popularity. Almost all smartphone and 
tablet manufacturers are bringing in this update to their devices, so this market is 
expected to rise steadily. In June 2012, ICS had a share of just 10.7 per cent.
Android Jelly Bean is currently only available on the Wi-Fi version of 
Motorola's Xoom tablet and on some of Google's Nexus devices (Galaxy Nexus, 
Nexus S and the new Nexus 7 tablet). Manufacturers are looking forward to 
bringing this update to existing compatible devices soon.
After Jelly Bean, it's the Android Key Lime Pie!   
Google released its latest Android flavour, Jelly Bean, at the annual I/O event 
held recently and for those who are thinking that the 
search giant will sit quiet for sometime, here is some 
news—the next Android version, which might be 4.2 
or 5.0 has been codenamed Key Lime Pie. Reports are 
rife that it will arrive in the first half of 2013.
Android Jelly Bean is currently only available on 
the Wi-Fi version of Motorola's Xoom tablet and on 
some of Google's Nexus devices (Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S and the new Nexus 
7 tablet). Since Jelly Bean only accounts for 0.8 per cent of the total Android 
market, what can we expect of the next version of Android - Key Lime Pie?
Well, you can expect to see a Metro UI in the upcoming Android version 
with pages of coloured panes, each housing a link to an app widget more like 
the Windows Phone 8 user interface with added flexibility.
Key Lime Pie may come with real time multi-tasking in smartphones and 
tablets as the experience of switching between apps cannot really be called 
multi-tasking. It's more like 'carrying on from where you left off.'
Users can also expect Key Lime Pie to bring in more multimedia codec 
Adobe releases open Source 
Sans Pro font
In an open source environment, there’s 
always one area where open source 
aesthetics falls short compared to 
the Windows and Mac ecosystems: 
professionally produced fonts.
Source Sans Pro, a new open 
source font from Adobe, can be used in 
a copyleft fashion, and is ready for use. 
Its licence, the SIL Open Font License, 
is considered free by the Free Software 
Foundation — there’s no better ‘free’ 
endorsement than that.
The font family comes in six 
weights, in upright and italic styles, 
and offers support for the Latin 
script, including Western and Eastern 
European languages, Vietnamese, 
Pinyin Romanisation of Chinese, 
and Navajo. A mono-space variant is 
currently under development. Source 
Sans Pro is the first font from Adobe 
to support both the Indian rupee and 
Turkish lira currency symbols.
“In making these fonts open 
source, it is important to us to make 
all the source files we used in their 
production, available, so that they can 
be referenced by others as a resource 
on how to build OpenType fonts 
with an AFDKO workflow. The full 
package of source files can be obtained 
from the Source Sans download page 
on SourceForge,” wrote Source Sans 
Pro’s creator Paul D Hunt.

improved with Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean but more is expected 
from the next version. 
GNOME to develop its own OS  
In a bid to catch up with the 
rest, the GNOME Desktop 
Project team is now working 
to develop its own operating 
system. The announcement 
about the GNOME OS was 
made by Allan Day, a user 
interface developer with Red Hat. The GNOME OS is supposed to be an 
option for tablets and mobile phones. It is worth mentioning here that 
Mozilla is also working to bring out its open source mobile OS.
It's good to see GNOME finally taking a call regarding the growing 
mobile and tablet markets but it would be interesting to see how long 
the project takes to become a reality. GNOME has been on the back foot 
ever since it was dropped by Canonical in April 2011, to be replaced by 
Unity in Ubuntu 11.04.
According to Day, the GNOME OS aims at “…providing a better 
experience for application developers, automated testing, sandboxed 
applications, and broad hardware compatibility” and the team hopes to 
improve the GNOME desktop that will ultimately be made available for use 
by other distros.
The world's first NFC keyboard for Android smartphones   
Japanese electronics company, Elecom, has come up with an NFC-enabled 
portable keyboard which 
is designed for Android 
smartphones. It uses the 
radio frequency of the 13.56 
MHz band and can be used 
by Android phone users at a 
distance of about 10 mm.
Once the initial software installation and configuration is completed, users 
just need to place their NFC-enabled Android device onto the space in the 
middle of the keyboard and start typing.
The device includes a built-in battery that is neither rechargeable nor 
replaceable. According to the company, it will last for 18 months if used for 
eight hours per day. So users will have no choice but to go for a replacement 
keyboard after that.
The 34 cm, 45-key keyboard is made of silicon. It can be folded away into 
a compact carrying case. At 144g, the keyboard comes with a retail price of 
approximately $240. It has been designed in collaboration with Norwegian 
firm, One2Touch.
The company has not disclosed any plans on when or whether the keyboard 
will be launched outside Japan.
Gertboard expansion board 
for Raspberry Pi
If you want to make your Raspberry 
Pi a powerful device, way beyond 
just a PC, you 
now can with 
Gertboard, which 
enables you to 
use Raspberry Pi 
as the brain of 
a robot, digital 
signage system 
or for many other 
such tasks.
The credit-card sized PC is 
powered by a 700 MHz ARM111 
processor and comes with 256 MB 
of memory and an SD card slot for 
storage. It can run a desktop Linux-
based operating system and users 
can connect it to a keyboard, mouse, 
Ethernet cable and monitor to make it 
a full-fledged PC.
But Gertboard can also add 
sensors, and input and output 
options to the computer. At the time 
of introducing Raspberry Pi, the 
developers also revealed Gertboard, 
which is an expansion board to add 
support for sensors, LEDs, motors 
and other peripherals.
Gertboard gets its name from 
its developer, Gert van Loo. The 
Raspberry Pi team has showcased 
the new version of the Gertboard on 
the company’s blog, with a number 
of updates and improvements. 
An official announcement, about 
Gertboard being ready to go on sale 
and at what cost, is expected soon.
Gertboard will help transform 
the Raspberry Pi from a low-cost 
computer to something similar to 
an Arduino board used for building 
robots, musical instruments, 
thermostats, security alarms or other 
devices.

Aakash 2 to have faster processor, better software
After many delays in the delivery of the Aakash tablet, the government is now 
giving the upgraded version, Aakash 2, a much-needed face-lift. The world’s 
cheapest tablet made for educational purposes will now get a better processor 
and the upgraded version of Google’s Android OS.
IIT-Bombay, the government’s designated nodal agency for the 
Aakash project, has asked device supplier Datawind for 1,000 tablets 
with the Android 4.0 version operating system. The tablet will run on a 1 
GHz microprocessor, which is expected to be 25 per cent faster than the 
previous version.
The tablet is likely to go into production in November this year, after 
which around 100,000 devices will be distributed among university students 
early next year.
It is worth mentioning here that Datawind had earlier agreed to supply 
Aakash tablets with Android 2.2 and an 800 MHz microprocessor for Rs 
2,276 per piece. However, the company did not comment on the price of the 
upgraded version.
Update your Android apps ‘smartly’
Updating apps from Google Play will now get smarter. Google has introduced 
what it calls ‘Smart App Updates’, which is easy on your phone’s battery life 
as well as the amount of data you download.
The concept of updating apps smartly was first announced at the 
Google I/O developer conference. ‘Smart App Updates’ allows the user to 
download only the updated part, which typically is only 30 per cent of the full 
application. This feature helps in case of big apps or games, which tend to use 
up a lot of the battery’s charge and your data download balance.
Smart App Updates is not dependent on the version of Google Play. It 
is ruled from the server-side. The feature will also be helpful to telecom 
operators, since it will take a load off their already congested networks.
The feature will ensure that people can easily access the latest version of an app.
Galaxy Note users can attend calls with the stylus!
Ever thought of talking with a stylus? Well, Samsung has made that possible 
for you. The Korean smartphone maker has showcased an all-new stylus with 
Galaxy Note 10.1. It’s called the BT S Pen (HM5100).
 The stylus appears to be the normal S pen that comes with Galaxy 
Note, but it has different capabilities. This little device includes Bluetooth, 
a microphone and a speaker. So, you can even attend calls with this 
‘special’ stylus.
The stylus comes with a vibration mechanism. It alerts users of 
incoming calls. You can then attend the call with the ‘call button’ placed 
near the earpiece. Some online reports vouch that the call quality is also 
good. The BT S Pen provides a talk time of 3 hours, and 130 hours of 
standby. It can be charged with the AC adapter by plugging in the micro-
USB port.
The BT S Pen weighs 21 grams and is Bluetooth 3.0 compatible. So it can 
be used with other devices as well. The company has not revealed the price and 
availability of this device so far.
Adobe Reader bug can 
affect Linux users
Adobe has ignored Linux users while 
fixing critical memory-related bugs 
in its Reader. Adobe resolved the 
issue for Windows and Mac OS X 
users, leaving Linux users to their 
own devices in a situation where 
researchers say that “potential 
attackers could find enough clues to 
build an exploit by comparing the 
current Windows version of Reader 
with the previous one.” One of the 
major concerns is that Linux users 
are running the patched versions of 
Adobe Reader, which contain 16 
open security holes.
The warning was issued by 
Internet search giant, Google, whose 
employees Mateusz Jurczyk and 
Gynvael Coldwind initially examined 
the PDF engine of the Chrome browser 
and discovered numerous holes. They 
then tested Adobe Reader and found 
about 60 issues that triggered crashes, 
40 of which are potential attack vectors, 
according to the H Open report.
There is very little that Linux 
users can do other than deleting the 
annots.api and PPKLite.api plug-ins 
from the /path/to/Adobe/Reader9/
Reader/intellinux/plug_ins directory. 
But this will address only two open 
security holes out of 16.

Overview
Y
es, you read that right. No matter what the 
warlords at Apple may tell you, you can run open 
source apps even if you are using Mac OS, which 
itself is closed source. 
Wondering why you ought to choose open source? 
Well, for a start, owning a Mac is an expensive proposition, 
so opting for open source applications on the Mac is one 
decision your wallet will appreciate. Second, it is common 
knowledge that open source applications are updated more 
frequently, are community-driven, and easily customisable. 
What more can one ask for?
The Internet
Mozilla Firefox: Seriously, who doesn’t know Firefox? 
It is one of the leading open source Web browsers (and 
it eats Safari for lunch). Definitely one of the most loved 
applications, irrespective of your platform!
Link: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
Chromium: If you are using Mac OS, chances are that 
you’ve opted for Google Chrome, instead of its open source 
sibling, Chromium. However, just for your information, if 
you need a true open source browser for the Mac, you can 
take a look at Chromium.
Link: www.chromium.org
Adium: This is an open source messenger that lets you 
connect to multiple IM platforms, such as AOL and GTalk 
(via Jabber). If you are a social networking addict and like to 
chat with your friends online, Adium can come in handy.
Link: http://adiumx.com/
Mozilla Thunderbird: Here’s an email suite-cum-calendar-
and-planner. It comes loaded with features such as powerful spam 
filters, easier email management, task planning, and more.
Link: http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/
RSSOwl: This is a cross-platform RSS client that lets you 
easily manage and read your RSS subscriptions.
Link: http://www.rssowl.org/download
Vienna: Here’s yet another RSS client, modelled along the 
lines of RSSOwl.
Link: http://www.vienna-rss.org/vienna2.php
Juice: Do you happen to be a creative artist? If you use the 
Internet to showcase your work using podcasts, you won’t find 
a better podcasting tool for Mac than Juice. It is totally free and 
open source, so give it a spin!
Link: http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php
Colloquy: This is a free and open source IRC client for the Mac.
Link: http://colloquy.info/downloads.html
Office suites and productivity
Bean: If you need a word processor for general use (creating 
and editing documents, dealing with multiple file formats like 
DOC, ODT and RTF, and so on), but do not wish to opt for 
super-expensive suites like MS Office, Bean should be worth 
a try. It is an open source word processor for Mac users, and 
comes loaded with great features.
Link: http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html
AbiWord: Here’s yet another open source and totally free 
word processor.
Link: http://www.abisource.com/download/
LibreOffice: If a mere word processor won’t do for you, instead of 
burning money on proprietary office suites, take a look at LibreOffice. 
Open Source Apps for Mac Users

D
r Sastri, an associate professor, wanted his students 
to do simulation of various topics in physics—but 
was taken aback by the licence fees for MATLAB, 
which ran into several lakhs of rupees for just a few licences. 
He did a search on the Internet, and found a completely free 
software called Scilab, which could be used for simulations. 
Scilab is just one example of many such FOSS tools that you 
should investigate before shelling out large sums of money 
for commercial software licences. Here is my list—headed, of 
course, by Scilab.
Scilab: This has been designed for scientific and 
numerical computations on an open computing platform. 
It has a command-line facility, and also allows the user to 
write programs in its own powerful programming language. 
It has hundreds of mathematical functions, and users can add 
programs written in other languages, including C and C++, to 
their program. Scilab has advanced data structures and also 
allows users to add data types of their own. One of its most 
important and common applications is simulation.
FreeMat: FreeMat is available for Windows and Linux, 
and can be used for rapid scientific prototyping and data 
processing; it is similar to MATLAB.
Maxima: As per Wikipedia, Maxima is a full-featured 
computer algebra system that specialises in symbolic 
operations and also offers numerical capabilities. It includes 
a complete programming language, and is available on both 
Windows and Linux.
Grace: This is a WYSIWYG 2D graph-plotting tool 
available on both Windows and Linux. It creates very high 
quality output, and can be used for both linear and non-linear 
curve fitting. It can also do Fast Fourier Transforms, integration 
and differentiation, splines, interpolation and smoothing.
KTechlab: This is an IDE (Integrated Development 
Environment) for electronic circuit design and simulation.
Latex: This is used to produce scientific documents, 
especially where mathematics symbols are involved. Latex 
can now be used to produce any type of document. It is 
currently available on most platforms.
Celestia: You can use this 3D astronomy program to view 
the universe at any point of time and from any place. You can 
even travel through any part of the universe at the speed of your 
choice! Celestia displays the orbital path of any object, allows 
users to orbit around the planets, and track various objects in 
space. It is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
Stellarium: This simulates a planetarium. It shows a 
realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the naked 
eye, binoculars or a telescope, once you enter your positional 
coordinates. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
Chemical Equation Expert: Chemistry professionals and 
students can use this tool to balance chemical equations and 
related calculations.
Kalzium: This is a digital replacement for the periodic table.
ACD/ChemSketch: Here is a package that helps you 
in drawing chemical structures, calculating molecular 
properties, 2D and 3D structure cleaning and viewing, and 
in the prediction of logP. It also has a function for naming 
structures containing less than 50 atoms and 3 rings. It is an 
excellent tool for chemistry students.
Avogadro: An easy-to-use software for both students and 
researchers, it features an advanced molecule editor and visualiser 
designed for use in computational chemistry, molecular modelling, 
bioinformatics, materials science and related areas. It offers 
flexible high-quality rendering and a powerful plug-in architecture.
The above list is just a sample of what is available on the 
Internet. Readers can visit http://www.bestfreewaredownload.
com/ for a comprehensive list of free software along with 
brief descriptions on each of them.  
There are many FOSS tools available in the field of science education. Schools and 
undergraduate colleges no longer need to buy software for many subjects. Here is a 
list of free software, almost all of which are available for both the Windows and Linux 
platforms for college students and staff.

    Linux was 
chosen for 
Raspberry Pi 
with a purpose
Eben Upton, executive director, Raspberry Pi
A credit-card sized computer with good capabilities at $25 is definitely 
amazing. Raspberry Pi is a trend-setting device. You may or may not like 
it, but you certainly cannot ignore it. Many small-sized computers have 
come into the market in the past, but none have made such an impact. 
The makers of Raspberry Pi chose Linux as the operating system for a 
reason. Apart from keeping the cost down, the very purpose of making 
such a device—to encourage programming amongst students—could be 
achieved only with Linux.
Diksha P Gupta from LINUX For You caught up with Eben Upton, 
executive director, Raspberry Pi Foundation, to discuss the concept, price, 
market and every thing else related to the computer. Read on...

For U & Me
Interview
Q
What made you think of a device like Raspberry Pi? 
I was working for the University of Cambridge back in 
2005-06. One of my jobs was to find high school students to 
come and study computer science at the university. A few of 
us noticed that the number of students opting for computer 
science was declining year after year, and their knowledge 
level was also declining simultaneously.
The students were bright but had less experience. So 
we had to spend more time to give them that experience 
after they joined the university. The challenge was to make 
them ready for the job or to do a Ph.D., which requires a 
lot of experience. This generation is not familiar with the 
programming bit. The root cause is the rise of home PCs 
and gaming consoles that have replaced the programming 
machines we used in the 1980s. We used machines like BBC 
Micros, Amigas and Spectrum ZX, with which we learnt 
how to program. I used to program on my own because those 
machines tempted me into programming. I do not see much 
of that happening now. This is where we felt the need for a 
machine that was similar to what we used and which would 
prompt students to program on their own. We wanted to 
bring out a cost-friendly yet powerful device. That’s how we 
came up with Raspberry Pi. 
Q
But why such a small device and why Linux?
Frankly, we were very driven by cost. Given that, we 
couldn’t add too much onto the device and that allowed us to 
make it small. Also, making a small device reduces the cost 
because the PCB is smaller and cheaper. If the PCB is smaller, 
the manufacturing capacity also increases. So, if you could 
manufacture one large computer at a given time in a panel, 
you can now make 10 pieces of the Raspberry Pi in a panel. 
This reduces the manufacturing cost in a big way. 
We wanted to make a product and driver with an emphasis 
on low-cost. Linux was chosen for the same reason. Linux 
was the most cost-friendly option. If I was to design a $400 
PC, I could have justified a Windows licence costing $50. 
But we were making a PC worth just $25; we could have not 
justified that. More importantly, Linux addresses the issue of 
making a machine better. An operating system is to make the 
user understand how the machine works. With the availability 
of the source code, Linux serves the purpose better. Linux 
is free—both from cost and source code perspectives. This 
freedom is really important from the education stand point. 
Q
Did you decide the cost of the device before you started 
designing Raspberry Pi?
Yes. We chose the price point before we started designing the 
machine. We had some early prototypes ready but they didn’t 
really meet our requirements. The feeling was that $25 could 
be the price of a text book. If you ask a student to purchase a 
special machine, those from the developed world may be able 
to afford a $100 PC especially to learn programming. But it is 
certainly difficult for students from other parts of the world. So 
for those students, a $25 device is absolutely apt and affordable.
Q
Did you conduct any survey before you made Raspberry 
Pi?
No, we did not conduct a survey for this one. It may sound 
crazy but we did not do any market research. We just thought of 
making a few computers that  people may be interested in buying. 
Q
How did you get the name Raspberry Pi?
The name actually is an interesting mix. If you recall the old 
days of microcomputers, there was a fruit-naming tradition like 
Acron, Tangerine Computer Systems or Apricot Computers. 
Raspberry is a reference to that tradition. Pi was used because 
originally we wanted to produce a computer that could only 
run Python. So Pi is derived from Python. We began making 
Raspberry Pi but we ended up making the device much more 
capable than what we had originally thought of. 
Q
There are several alternatives to Raspberry Pi available 
in the market right now. What is your take on them?
First of all, all the devices termed as alternatives to 
Raspberry Pi tend to be more expensive. No one has made 
a device at the same price point as ours. To the best of my 
knowledge, they are also less powerful when compared 
to the Raspberry Pi. We have a lot of competitors who are 
more expensive and less efficient than us. All are based on 
Chinese APIs, so they tend to be low-performance devices. 
Having said that, we don’t really mind people making low-
cost devices because we are not for profit and none of us 
are going to get rich. But as of now, we do not see anyone 
measuring up to what Raspberry Pi has achieved in terms 
of performance and cost.
Q
So you are not insecure about these devices?
I think we are doing okay. We are doing a lot of volumes. I 
think the device we offer is more powerful from a multimedia

For U & Me
standpoint as compared to the others. We are starting to build 
a community now and we hope to see a good future. 
Q
Which of the available devices is your closest 
competition?
The one I would find interesting would be with a 
high performance. So, I can think of three classes of 
competitors. First, the devices that are priced around $60-
70 are generally based on Chinese APIs. I don’t find them 
better because they are more expensive than ours. Then 
there are devices which are much more expensive than 
ours and better in performance, like the Beagleboard. It 
is three to four times more expensive than the Raspberry 
Pi. The one that I really find interesting is Odroid, which 
is priced at around $130. It is powered by an Exynos4412 
Cortex-A9 Quad Core processor. It is an interesting device 
because it does things we can’t do, unlike the other devices 
we are competing with. 
Q
How many pieces of Rasberry Pi do you aim to ship?
I think shipping 50,000 pieces of the device monthly would 
be fine but we aspire to reach the level of 100,000 pieces. 
Q
But if we look at the current demand for Raspberry Pi, 
you are not able to meet it. Why have shipments got 
delayed?
I think we are very close to meeting the demand and 
completing the orders. One of our two distributors made the 
Raspberry Pi delivery in August. So I think we are able to 
catch up with the demand. Very soon, we will be able to not 
only meet the demand but also create a back-up of the stock.
Q
What features do you think are missing in Raspberry Pi 
just because it is a low-cost device?
The one feature that I think could have increased the 
adoption and popularity of Raspberry Pi is Wi-Fi. 
Regarding the rest of it, I think Raspberry Pi is a good 
package as compared to the others. We have good 
interfacing capabilities. It can have good accelerated 
multimedia capabilities, which many of these devices offer. 
Another thing that I really find missing in Raspberry Pi is 
a camera. If I ever go for a new interface, I would add a 
camera to it, for sure. 
Q
What is the Raspberry Pi summer code contest that you 
have announced?
This contest is for students. I think students should be 
taught coding not only to get into a job but to program 
their own machines. They should be given some 
incentives to get into programming. It is a high-frequency 
competition. The idea is to provide an opportunity where 
children are motivated to program. We want students from 
all parts of the world to participate in this and we are 
hopeful that we will see some very good apps coming out. 
The contest is just for students. 
Q
Can you provide the software details of Raspberry Pi?
Currently we run Debian Linux. Actually, we run 
a version of Debian Linux called Raspbian, which is 
customised for the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian introduces more 
comprehensive support for floating point operations. This is 
the result of an enormous amount of hard work by the team 
over the past couple of months and replaces the existing 
Debian squeeze image. 
Q
Small-sized computers and low-cost tablets have 
become a rage. What is the minimum investment 
required to develop a proper computing device?
It is hard to develop a good computing device for less than 
$20. The money goes into a processor, which costs around $5; 
it goes into memory which costs around $4-5; into the PCB 
and a bunch of connectors which may cost around $5 and 
putting them together may cost another $5. So a computing 
machine cannot be made in less than $20. 
Q
How do you see India as a market for Raspberry Pi?
India is a really important market for a device like 
Raspberry Pi. Indians have recently shown a lot of interest in 
low-cost computing devices and Raspberry Pi can be a great 
alternative for those who want to have a good computing 
device. Not only in India, but in all the developing nations 
where computing amongst students is still to be made 
popular. We have kept such a low price-point only to make 
the device popular amongst the students and to encourage 
programming amongst them. I am sure Indian students will 
like the product.
Q
Do you plan to join hands with the Indian government to 
take the product to schools?
We have not gone ahead to discuss this so far. But the 
Raspberry Pi Foundation would not mind if the government 
in India finds our device exciting enough to give it to their 
students. We are open to work on such lines. 
This generation is not familiar with 
the programming bit. The root cause 
is the rise of home PCs and gaming 
consoles that have replaced the 
programming machines we used in 
the 1980s. We used machines like 
BBC Micros, Amigas and Spectrum 
ZX, with which we learnt how to 
program. I used to program on 
my own because those machines 
tempted me into programming.

f you are new to Linux, your curiosity will far outweigh 
your familiarity with this open source platform. This 
article will give you a gentle introduction to the world 
of world of robotics software in Linux.
In Ubuntu 12.04, if you do a quick search for ‘robot’ 
in the Ubuntu Software Centre, the top two results you get 
will be GvRng and Robocode. Let's take a look at these. 
One would also probably find Robots, which however, is a 
game and not related to robotics.
GvRng
GvRng or Guido Van Robot—the name is a play on Guido 
Van Rossum, the creator of the Python programming language. 
Though it is not a robot programming platform, one can get to 
learn basic robot navigation, pick and drop operations, etc. The 
GUI is devised using Python. The avid programmer will find 
GvRng similar to the Logo and Karel programming languages.
Another similar GUI-based interface is RUR-PLE, 
available at http://code.google.com/p/rur-ple/, and it is not 
in Ubuntu’s software repository. The developers promote it 
as “…an environment designed to help you learn computer 
programming using the language Python.” Coding in GvRng 
and RUR-PLE is very similar.
Robocode
Robocode is designed so that it appeals as a battle of tanks. 
However, a good lot of robot programming can be learnt 
from it. There is built-in code for line following and obstacle 
avoidance. Coded in Java, there is a Windows version of the 
same software.
Graduating a little, we proceed to....
Simbad, the robot simulator
It is only natural to wish for platforms that allow 3D 
visualisation. Probably midway between ROS and Robocode 
is Simbad, a Java-based 3D robot simulator with support for 
programming the robot in Java or Jython. It provides support 
for sensors, bumpers and camera. For advanced users, Simbad 
provides a facility to incorporate evolutionary and neural 
network-based algorithms into their code. However, the 
This is the concluding part of the series on open source robotics. The previous three 
parts introduced the Linux enthusiast to the Robot Operating System (ROS), the 
Player/Stage platform and other interesting aspects of robotics. This article is for the 
Linux newbie.

downside is that this project is 
no more being developed; the 
latest version, Simbad 1.4, was 
released in July 2007.
Player Project
Though Simbad will have good 
interfacing of sonars, lasers, etc, 
you are bound to find restrictions 
on geometrical shapes, and the 
lack of a modular structure to 
incorporate any type of robot. 
Voilà! Enter Player Project, http://
playerstage.sourceforge.net/. Elements of Player Project have 
been discussed in Part 1 and Part 2 of this series. Player Project 
started off as a union of three software: Player (the server for 
controlling robots), Stage (2.5D simulations) and Gazebo (3D 
simulations). Later, both Stage and Gazebo were developed as 
standalones, and also incorporated into Robot Operating System 
(ROS). The great advantage that Player Project allows for is that 
the code used in simulation can also be used in real robots to 
provide for similar behaviour. Thus, Player Project assimilates 
the two interfaces of control and simulation, and nearly all 
current-day robotics platforms attempt to do so.
Other mentions, away from the open source realm, are 
Microsoft Robotics Developers Studio, http://www.microsoft.com/
robotics/ and Webots, http://www.cyberbotics.com/overview. Both 
are wonderful software, though not in the spirit of open source.
The truth is out there!
With the development of Robot Operating System, there was a 
surge in such platforms. One hurdle of Player Project was the 
issues with installation and stability. ROS structured various 
such robot software into an OS-like organisation. At the time 
of writing, ROS Fuerte (version 1.8.X) had been released,

ndroid smartphones have today outflanked 
rivals and turned into kings in the mobile space. 
According to research firm IDC, Android-powered 
smartphones outpaced iPhone sales 4:1 during the second 
quarter of 2012. Latest statistics by Gartner also reveal 
that while the Android OS reigned supreme in the global 
smartphone terrain in Q2 with a 64.1 per cent market share, 
Apple’s iOS stood second at 18.8 per cent, with Nokia's 
Symbian at 5.9, and RIM's Blackberry at 5.2 per cent. As 
Android registers a robust growth, smartphone vendors, too, 
are clamouring to ride the Android bandwagon and cater to 
the changing consumer trends.  
Android: What’s next? 
Industry pundits are gung-ho about the fact that Google’s 
Android OS will not just be confined to the key domains 
of smartphones, tablets and television, but will become 
more personalised in future and make its way into home 
appliances. According to them, the day is not far when 
consumers will be able to control their household gadgets 
using their Android-based devices.  S N Rai, co-founder and 
director of Lava Mobile, a homegrown mobile phone brand 
that recently launched its Intel-based Android smartphone 
Xolo X900, explains, “In future, the need for complete 
customisation would grow and Android will become smarter, 
and understand user requirements; it will converge these into 
all household devices and personal gadgets. Google has taken 
up an interesting initiative to make this vision feasible by 
launching what is called the Android @Home project. This 
aims to formulate a service in which the Android OS will act 
as a remote control to all your home devices. Soon, you will 
have the power to manage the security, geysers, lights, DVD 
players, etc, at your home with your Android smartphone.”
With all the customisation options available in the 
Android ecosystem, Android could soon dominate the world 
economy, feels Shashin Devsare, executive director, Karbonn 
Mobiles, a brand that has recently made a foray into the tablet 
market and launched the Jelly Bean-powered Smart Tab 1. 
“In the earlier stages of the computing boom, Microsoft took 
the world by storm. Android is all set to repeat that feat. 
Sectors like banking, sports and human communication will 
be taken over by the Android ecosystem in the days to come. 
The patronage of Google will take Android to the next level 
of human communication and will touch us in every way 
possible,” says Devsare. 
Safeguarding the future
Even though Android smartphones are currently basking 
in the glory of an enormous market share, experts feel the 
survival of the Android OS lies in its security system.  The 
latest figures by Kaspersky Lab state that there has been a 
conspicuous increase in Android malware, and the number 
With the Android OS making its presence felt in smartphones, tablets and the tube, 
the question of, “What next?” seems inevitable. The LFY team got in touch with leading 
Android smartphone vendors to learn more about how secure the Android OS is, the key 
brand differentiators in terms of apps, and more.

of smartphones infected tripled in the second quarter of 
2012. Quite some time back, Android smartphone users 
became casualities to fake versions of the photo-sharing 
app Instagram, which imposters used to run up huge mobile 
phone bills. And downloading a fake app can be hazardous, 
warns Kelvin Lim, director - ASEAN and India, Sophos, an 
IT security firm.  “If a user downloads a fake app, a backdoor 
will be created to let cyber offenders make their way to 
sensitive data stored on the device. It also facilitates future 
downloads of malware onto the device, which may lead to 
data theft through the installation of key loggers,” says Lim. 
Offering a piece of advice for Android smartphone users, he 
adds, “Always download apps only from the vendor's official 
app store. Read the terms and conditions before downloading 
them, and do not just click ‘Next’ blindly. A verification code 
in most cases requires acknowledgment. The absence of this 
should make the user suspicious about the 
legality of the download.”  
With security turning out to be a 
major concern for Android smartphone 
users, do handset vendors provide any 
additional layer of security? Victor 
Shanxin, president, Huawei Device India, 
a brand that offers cloud services to its 
smartphone users, elucidates, “Huawei is 
committed to work with partners to ensure 
mobile device security, and build a secure 
and reliable platform for mobile devices 
to take full advantage of the Android 
security framework. Our device security is divided into four 
levels—the safety of the equipment, data security, network 
security and application security. This four-level architecture 
guides the formulation of the security policy. We provide 
data security, storage and access, support for data backup 
(cloud and local backup), remote device back functions 
(remote location, remote control, mobile phone alarm, call 
forwarding, the remote device lock, remote data wipe, etc) – 
all of which ensure data security in the smartphones.” 
Android Apps: On the march
As Android works on the open source system, it gives users 
innumerable choices to devise customised apps according 
to their needs. Those at Samsung, the numero uno brand 
in smartphones, believe that consumers today are looking 
at buying mobile devices that will empower them with

more exciting applications while on the 
move. “Samsung users have plenty of 
choices when it comes to apps and that's 
a major differentiator for our brand.  The 
gaming experience in Galaxy SIII is 
enhanced through ‘Game Hub’, providing 
access to numerous social games. Users 
in India can download Indian-oriented 
applications like My Movies, My Music 
and MyReader, which allow them to enjoy 
and personalise their smartphones. The 
MyStation app allows users to watch live 
concerts, performances and videos of their 
favourite stars. Another useful app, 'Handy', allows users 
to search, book and pay for flights, movie tickets, look 
for a restaurant and reserve a table.  We make sure that 
our devices are a delight for our customers to use,” says 
Ranjit Yadav, country head, Mobile and IT, Samsung. 
Advantage Android: An open environment 
When it comes to developing applications on smartphones, 
developers choose the Android OS over Apple's iOS, 
feels Sanjay Maheshwary, marketing head, LG Mobile 
Communications, a brand that has recently launched a series 
of smartphones. “Though both have their own advantages, the 
Android OS provides an open environment for application 
developers and lets them play around with varied features 
as compared to the iOs platform. Provided with better 
customising options, the Android OS is definitely a cut 
above,” says Maheshwary.

Overview
O
nline help and User manuals are given lesser 
priority when localising software. This is usually 
due to  complexity of the help/documentation and 
also inadequate understanding of dealing with the relevant 
files. Most help documentation consists of multiple  pages 
written in some form of markup language with each page 
consisting of paragraphs and links to other pages. XML 
based mark-up languages have traditionally been used  for 
help documentation. There are helpful utilities to generate 
documentation in HTML, PDF and other online formats.
In this article, I present the structure of the help files, 
explore Mallard project for online help and illustrate the 
sequence of steps for localising with Gedit as an example.
The structure of help files 
On a typical UNIX system, help files are stored as follows:
/usr/share/help
  |--/gedit : Application
     |----/C :Reference help in English-US
     |----/te : Langauge help inTelugu
     |----/hi : Language help in Hindi
Under each help directory, there is a set of mark-up files 
and a directory for figures. Each mark-up file can be converted 
into a ‘.po’ file, which can be translated in a localisation 
environment and converted back to XML. XML utilities are 
used for these steps. As there can be several XML files, there 
are also tools available to convert all of them into a single ‘.po’ 
file, which can be converted back to XML files after translation.
After translation, the XML files and figures are copied 
into the designated location, so that the system’s help engine 
can pick them up as per the locale of the user. For error 
checking, the translated files can be viewed in the help 
browser, or can be processed to yield HTML or PDF files.
Mallard
Mallard is gaining momentum as a mark-up language better 
suited for the purposes of online help. Its chief advantage is 
reference inversion, i.e., each page specifies the names of other 
pages that are to be linked to it. The Mallard compiler ensures 
that help pages are updated with proper links from the source 
pages. This makes the documentation evolve with the software, 
with changes required to fewer files. A lot of disadvantages of the 
older Docbook format have also been overcome with Mallard.
Process for gedit localisation
Let’s look at how to localise the Gedit help into Telugu. Gedit 
is a popular and powerful editor in GNOME environment. It 
supports internationalized text (UTF-8) and features configurable 
syntax highlighting for various languages along with  print 
preview, configurable fonts. Figure 1 shows the Telugu version 
of Gedit (localised) and Figure 2 shows its  help page (in 
English). Install itstool (on Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install itstool). 
If any of the commands in the following steps don’t work, install 
the corresponding packages and repeat the steps.
Step1: Locate the reference Gedit documentation on your 
system as per the details given earlier, or clone the repository 
with git clone http://git.gnome.org/browse/gedit.
Step 2: Build te.po from the reference help files. The 
following commands are for the local version of the Gedit 
documentation repository, if the Telugu PO file is not already 
part of the package: "at /usr/share/help/te".
 Note: I picked the Gedit application as an example 
for this, as it is the default text editor of GNOME. I have 
tried out everything mentioned in this article on Ubuntu 
12.04 and configured it for Telugu. You may need to adapt 
the steps for your OS and locale.
$ cd gedit/help/C
$ itstool -l te *.page -o ../te/te.po
Step 3: Translate the PO file. Use Poedit or any PO file 
editor or the Gedit text editor itself to translate. Make use of 
the translation memories and glossaries available for your 
language to enhance productivity and consistency. Keep 
Gedit open in the desired locale, and take care to use the 
localised UI in the help documentation. One easy way to 
ensure this is to generate  translation memory and glossary 
from the localised UI po file, and to use localisation tool 
such as poedit to provide translation tips. As the strings may

be large in number, it is a good practice to search for the 
strings in the displayed root page of the help documentation 
and translate them first, before  going on to other pages as 
per the links from the root page.
Step 4: Generate the MO file from the PO file (msgfmt -v 
te.po -o te.mo)
Step 5: Generate XML files with the translated MO file as 
input using (itstool -l te -m te.mo -o testte/ *.page). If itstool 
throws up errors, please check the PO file for syntactical 
correctness, and use the msgmerge utility to merge the 
translated PO file with the original PO file to improve the 
syntax of the localised PO file
Step 6: Copy the generated mark-up files to the 
location used by the help system for the application (cp 
-r testte /usr/share/help/te/gedit). Update the figures with 
those corresponding to the target locale.
Step 7: View the help in the GNOME Help browser (yelp 
/usr/share/help/te/gedit), or launch the application and verify 
the quality of the translation.
Step 7: If required, repeat Steps 3-7.
Step 8: Submit the updated PO file  as a comment to 
the Web-based Gnome documentation page for Gedit (eg: 
http://l10n.gnome.org/vertimus/gedit/gnome-3-4/help/te)

ccording to a leading IT job site, www.dice.com, 
job openings for Android developers soared by 
50 per cent in early 2012. In the wake of the 
increasing rush for proficient developers, a plethora of IT 
training institutes across the country are launching special 
curriculum and conducting classes for Android application 
development. So if you wish to take this unexplored yet 
promising career option, you can hone your creative skills 
in a good institute.
Android development: A big career boost!
Neeraj Kumar, director, Tech Mentro, Noida, says, “The 
Android OS is literally flexing its muscles in the mobile 
domain and it won’t be wrong to say that jobs for Android 
application development may even surpass the Apple 
market. The Android applications platform promises vast 
job potential in the current IT field. This is not just confined 
to the mobile application development, but also has scope 
in hardware solutions like Android customisation or 
optimisation, device drivers, etc.” 
Echoing similar views, Vikram C, founder of 
InfoWinder Training Academy, Jaipur, says, “Android 
development as a career segment is the next big thing in 
the job industry. The job market for Android programming 
is gaining momentum at an amazing pace. Moreover, 
there is a dearth of talent in this much-talked about field 
and, soon, major companies will make a beeline for good 
Android development professionals. So, for those who are 
planning to make a career in this uncharted arena, getting 
enrolled in a good training institute will serve the purpose 
and help them gather the requisite skills.”
 Why are training institutes important? 
At a time when online tutorials are the order of the day, 
why would anyone opt to enroll in a training institute for 
Android programming? Ramesh Kumar, director, Linux 
Learning Centre Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, quips, “Training 
institutes help you have a wider view of the whole process.

training makes it a holistic experience for all those who 
want to acquire the know-how about the subject.”  
The skills in demand
While most Android applications are written in Java, an 
adept Android professional should have the basic knowledge 
of Java, HTML and other general technical skills, says 
Madeeswer Gandhi V, managing director, IgniteMindz, 
Chennai. “Developers who know the principles of object-
oriented programming and understand user interface will 
have an advantage over others. But getting trained in a good 
institute will definitely help them cope with the requirements 
of the job market. A proficient programmer should be able 
to juggle between languages effortlessly, since Android 
apps development essentially needs learning a new syntax. 
Innovative thinking to work on the differing needs of the 
consumers will spell success for an Android programmer and 
this is possible once you get good training,” says Gandhi. 
The moolah factor
So, what is the average remuneration that an Android 
developer can expect? “The average salary starts from Rs 
15,000-Rs 18,000 per month, depending on the expertise, 
experience and the position of the individual. The rapid 
growth of the Android market will soon see companies 
fighting it big to hire more talented developers and this will, in 
turn, give way to higher remuneration,” says Tarun Acharya, 
managing director, Linux Lab, Pune. And what are the basic 
fees to get enrolled in a training institute? “For beginners, 
it ranges between Rs 12,000 to Rs 14,000, and the course 
duration is generally four weeks,” adds Acharya.
Handy tips
While building a career as an Android apps developer 
seems to be the next big thing, what are the tips experts can 
give to beginners in this industry? “When you develop a 
personalised app, publish it on the cloud-based Google Play 
(earlier known as Android Market). Keep a provision so that 
even others can use and benefit from it. You can also quote 
a price for it. Once your apps become popular, money will 
automatically flow,” says Ballabrao Vasu, chief technical 
officer, EasyARM, Bengaluru.

Tribute
Kenneth Gonsalves... People active in the 
Indian open source space will be familiar with 
this name. He was a strong personality and a 
man who never minced his words. We lost him 
on August 3, 2012. 
A Tribute to  
Kenneth Gonsalves  
The Man Who Truly Lived 
Open Source Technology
K
enneth Gonsalves was an inspiration to many. He 
was a philosopher and guide to new entrants to 
the open source world, a constant reference point 
for the current users, and a guard against those who tried 
to mess with the technology.
Gonsalves was active on a majority of Linux User 
Groups in India. A lawyer by profession and fondly called 
Lawgon, his love for open source technology made him 
an eminent protagonist in the Free Software Movement. 
Ramadass, a.k.a. Amachu, who had been in close contact 
with Gonsalves, remembers him as someone who was a 
“user, developer and mentor of open source technology.” 
Ramadass said, “Kenneth contributed to open source 
technology in every possible way. He lived open source 
technology and showed this way of life to others as well.”
Kenneth: The techie
Gonsalves was known for his amazing Python 
programming skills. He also had a good grasp of 
Django Web application development. He was one 
of the key persons involved in the setting up of the 
Python Software Society, India. He also made major 
contributions to Tamil computing and Open Streetmap.
Jaganadh G, an open source enthusiast and a close 
friend of Gonsalves said, “KG was a great mentor to many 
successful FOSS professionals. His thoughts, vision and 
software development practices were unique. He was 
very selective about the operating system flavours, tools 
and RDBMS... He was a person who practised what he 
preached. His personality, mode of FOSS development 
and community management strategies should be an 
example for others too.”
Some of his FOSS projects are unique, like Djangogolf 
(a golf management system), avasp and avaspdjango 
(a financial accounting system). Gonsalves always 
remembered to carry a GPS device around with him to 
map the places that he visited.  
Yogesh Girikumar, an admirer of Gonsalves and an 
open source enthusiast, said, “Kenneth contributed to open 
source by the way of code as well as advocacy. He has helped 
numerous 'newbies' technically and was a vocal advocate 
of open source software. He had strong opinions on several 
people involved in FOSS regarding their ideologies and 
practices. He was also involved in NRC-FOSS. He was an 
educator, evangelist and an all-out programmer.”
Kenneth on mailing lists
Many FOSS lovers know Gonsalves because of their 
interactions with him on mailing lists. He was very active 
on the Django mailing list, the Bangalore Python Users 
Group mailing list, the ILUG-CBE mailing list and many 
others. He always wanted to ensure that the interactions 
happening were smooth and as per the guidelines of the 
FOSS mailing list.

In any forum that talks about programming, a 
frequent topic is, “What is the best IDE for the 
language/framework under discussion?” This 
often leads to lengthy flame wars, because programmers are 
passionate about the tools they choose to work with. And there 
are a very large number of tools available—right from simple 
text editors like KWrite to behemoths like Emacs. What do 
people mean when they talk about an IDE? They usually mean 
one tool that helps automate the development and deployment 
of an application. Let us look at what it takes to develop and 
deploy a Web application...
There are a plethora of free/open source 
databases around—from the good old Berkeley 
DB, PostgreSQL, to the newer NoSQL DBs like 
MongoDB, to mention a few. Most of these have easy-
to-use GUI interfaces too. As a result, the threshold to 
becoming a “database administrator” has become very low, 
and the quality of the average database is abysmal. People 
who do not know the A or B of database design are happily 
doing mission-critical stuff. SQL injection was discovered 
in the last century, and the prevention is well known— 
but guess which is still one of the most popular ways of 
cracking websites?...

Amachu remembers, “He never took much credit on 
mailing lists but he expressed himself in a way that others 
could learn from his successes as well as failures. The lists to 
which he belonged will definitely miss him.”
Kenneth: The believer
Kenneth Gonsalves was a man of strong beliefs. He lived his life 
with conviction regarding open source technology and he passed on 
his beliefs to his family as well. Amita Gonsalves, the elder daughter 
of the Gonsalves couple, said, “Dad introduced all of us to open 
source technology to the extent that we did not know there actually 
was a Windows world that existed. I remember the first time I was 
exposed to Windows in my school; I was rather confused as to why 
it was so different from what I did at home. He made my mom, my 
sister and I work only on open source technology.”
Kenneth was ‘unapproachable’ via the normal means of 
communication. You had to email him to get a quick reply! Amita 
FOSS IS
remembers, “For all the issues that I had to discuss with Dad, 
ranging from technology to anything in life, email was the 
easiest way. I remember I wanted to ask him something and we 
were at the same place. I tried calling him but he didn't respond. 
I then mailed him to check if he is around and immediately got 
my reply. That was the technology side of my Dad.”
Amita recalls the day Gonsalves left this world. She says, 
“I called up Dad in the morning before going for work and 
he complained about some uneasiness. He had to deliver a 
talk at one of the colleges that day, which he had postponed. 
I told him to take some rest and said that I would call him 
later. That ‘later’ never came. I got the news of his leaving us 
at around 1.30 pm on August 3.”  
The open source world highly values the 
sanctity of copyright, and frowns on plagiarism 
and “piracy” of all kinds. At the same time, the 
idea of open source does not mean throwing the source 
code into the public domain for all and sundry to use in 
any manner that they want. So there are two contradictory 
targets here. The authors of the code want to ensure that 
the largest number of people are able to benefit from their 
code in the fullest manner possible. Yet, at the same time, 
they are not happy with people misusing their code to 
make unfair profits from it...
Unfortunately, a lot of people and companies 
are attempting to cash in on the popularity 
of open source by subverting open source 
licenses and offering bogus open source products. In the 
long run, these bogus products wind up causing great 
harm to the open source movement by raising false 
expectations and not fulfilling them. The most common 
example is to have two versions of the software—a free 
“community” edition and a proprietary paid version. The 
free version has limited features and functionality. The 
paid-for version has all the bells and whistles. But all the 
advertising and hype is about the paid version...
Kenneth Gonsalves was a regular contributor to LINUX For You magazine. The magazine 
cherishes his contribution for spreading the word of open source through the platform. Here 
are a few extracts of his writing under the section 'FOSS IS FUN'.

‘Workbench’ helps to define who should do what to 
manage content on a site.
Managing Content 
Security in Drupal 7
I
n any organisation, there is the inevitable issue of 
who should manage content on the website. There are 
concerns about the authenticity of the information, 
and accountability for the content displayed on the site. In 
many cases, organisations do not mind delaying making 
information available since they are very averse to 
inappropriate content showing up on their site.
By default, you can control access by defining roles. 
Those in a particular role may have access rights to a 
content type. This is generally too restrictive an option. The 
same content type may be used across the organisation, but 
rights may depend on the actual content. As expected, there 
are a number of modules available for Drupal 7 that address 
certain aspects of this concern. The module that you may 
find very useful is Workbench (http://drupal.org/project/
workbench). It consists of four additional modules. We 
will discuss the access and moderation modules, which are 
especially useful and relevant in most instances.
Access
Typically, the first area of concern is to allow only certain 
people to manage sub-sections in a site. For example, the 
marketing department should be responsible for any sales-and 
marketing-related content. Content related to each product 
can be managed by the corresponding product manager—that 
is, a hierarchical control is desirable for the management of 
the website.
The Workbench Access module provides two 
mechanisms for controlling access. The first way is by 
using a menu. Menus are hierarchical. So, access rights 
can be given to people for each node of a menu. A person 
with rights to the Products node will have rights to the 
individual products under that node.
This set-up is very simple to understand, and seems easy 
to implement. However, it requires the menu to be modelled 
on the ownership hierarchy of the content. In some instances, 
content managed by the marketing department may need 
to be a part of the Corporate (or some other) node. This 
complicates the management of access rights. It is better 
to identify particular content with a label, and manage the 
content accordingly, regardless of where it may be displayed 
on the site. To meet this need, the alternative taxonomy-
based mechanism offered by Workbench Access is a far 
better option. You define a hierarchical taxonomy, very much 
like a menu, using the Structure => Taxonomy option in 
the administrative menu. You need to worry only about the 
parent-child relationship in the definition of the taxonomy, 
and not about the type of content each node represents.
Once the taxonomy is created, you can enable the 
Workbench Access module and associate the newly created 
taxonomy with it. Each term in the taxonomy becomes a 
Section to be managed by Workbench Access. You need to 
make sure the content types you want to be managed by 
access control are enabled.
The next step is to associate editors with each section—
that is, you add those users for each section, who are 
permitted access to the corresponding section. Now, when 
users try to add content, they can only do so in a section for 
which they have rights and nothing more.
Moderation
It is better to try one module at a time, for better 
understanding of the flow. Hence, disable the Workbench 
Access module and uninstall it. Now, enable the 
Workbench Moderation module, then enable the content 
types that need to be moderated, by selecting Structure => 
Content Types in the administration menu. Then check the 
Create New Revision and Enable Moderation of Revisions 
options. This is done in the Publishing options for each 
content type that needs moderation.
Often, one is required to review and edit content before 
it is published. So, you need to keep track of the state of 
a document beyond merely whether it is published or not. 
When authors enter content, it will be in the draft state. 
The authors may complete the entry over several sessions. 
Once they are satisfied, they should change the state of 
the content to Needs Review. The reviewer may approve 
the content as-is, or after editing it, and push it to the 
Published state. In case the reviewers are not satisfied, 
they may put it back in the draft state.
These are the default states in the Workbench 
Moderation module. You may wish to add a Reviewed

state in case publishing is done by someone other than the 
reviewer. The module is pretty versatile. The permissions 
are controlled by Drupal roles. Workbench Moderation adds 
some more entries in the already large set of permission 
options (People => Permissions in the administration 
menu). The configuration options for the Workbench 
Moderation module include an option to check permissions. 
It does not set any permissions but helps you ensure that the 
permissions for a role have been set appropriately.
Moderation and access control
As you might expect, if both the Workbench Access and 
Moderation modules are installed, you can control the 
activity that a specific user or users can perform on content 
identified by a taxonomy. Each module is configured 
independently, and the rights for a user are based on a 
combination of both the modules. Users will be allowed 
access to a piece of content as per the Access module, 
but what they can do to that content will be as per the 
rights for the role to which they belong. It is a bit tricky to 
separate the two concerns in the beginning; however, once 
you experiment a bit with each module separately, and 
understand their configuration options, it is not too difficult.
Finally, how do users know what items are pending 
for them? This is where the Workbench module, which is 
included in the administration menu, comes into the picture. 
Since you may not want the administration menu bar to 
be available to all users, add a link with the path admin/
workbench to the user menu.
Getting security and access rights properly defined is 
never easy. Getting it right takes time and effort. It is far 
better to spend time up front and experiment with various 
options, than to ignore it. The cost of ignoring security is 
usually very high in case anything goes wrong. Perhaps the 
biggest personal cost is the embarrassment of having to own 
up to being sloppy and careless.

T
he need for, and the means of, communication 
between individuals of similar interests has existed 
since time immemorial. Discussion forums like 
Google Groups have scaled interaction to higher levels. 
Everyone benefits from an interaction. The people who 
contribute at some time are on the receiving side the rest of 
the time. This development of knowledge is what enables 
progress in science and technology.
Vanilla Forums (VF) is a discussion forum based on the 
LAMP stack, which can improve the levels of interaction and 
collaboration within your organisation.
Why another forum software?
There are many discussion forums on the Internet that 
employees already participate in. They could be officially 
representing the company in some, and sharing their personal 
views in others. Having a forum within the organisation (on 
the intranet) helps the company in many ways. Companies 
need a barrier to prevent confidential information from 
flowing outside. Also, the overexposure of employees on 
public forums or social networking sites could result in the 
company’s image taking a beating. Further,  a discussion 
forum on the company intranet can complement real-time 
interactions. Most individuals are hard pressed for time at 
work and may lack opportunities to meet for discussions. 
Forum conversations can enable more people to join the 
discussion at a convenient time.
The greatest benefit of intranet discussion forums will 
be greater productivity. They help ‘break the ice’ and get 
like-minded people to form groups. Such collaboration, 
given the right direction, could lead to better ideas, a 
better workplace atmosphere, and also can act as effective 
bottom-to-top communication.
Hosting an intranet discussion group
While there are many discussion forum products 
available, Vanilla is ideal for informal interactions on 
the intranet. Its set-up and configuration are very simple. 
It has an easy registration process, and a good number 
of plug-ins that add features. The look-and-feel of the 
product is just right for people to ‘hang out’. The default 
theme is simple and attractive enough to get started with 
conversations. Whether it involves pictures of the recent 
team outing, or speaking out against a petrol price hike,

Figure 1: Discussion forum
Figure 2: Getting started
Figure 3: Customised logo in banner 
the forums allow different categories of discussion, and 
also enable tagging them.
Vanilla features
Vanilla is available as downloadable software and also as 
a service. If you prefer Vanilla as a service, you need to 
choose a monthly subscription fee based on the size of the 
organisation. Though we focus on the downloadable version, 
you can grasp Vanilla's features and flexibility on the 
subscription option.
Easy to get started: The most important feature of 
any discussion forum is to allow new users to get started 
without much learning. While other software could have 
more features, Vanilla beats them because of its easy-to-use 
interface.
Popularity-based sorting: The discussions are sorted 
based on popularity and likes. This makes it easy for users 
to find hot topics.
Highly portable: Vanilla is implemented in PHP, making 
it highly portable on various platforms.
Customisable: This software was created to be 
customisable—regarding not just its look-and-feel, but its 
functionality too. The architectural premise was to keep the 
core light and fast, and allow extension in the form of plug-
ins and applications.
Easy integration: This software has the option to 
integrate with social networking sites such as Facebook 
and Twitter.
Mobile client support: Vanilla comes with a mobile 
theme suited for smaller screens, which is a delight for users 
on mobile devices.
Setting up Vanilla
You need to have the LAMP stack pre-installed; minimum 
versions include PHP 5.2.0 and MySQL 5. Download the 
software from http://vanillaforums.org/. Unzip the zip file 
into the Web server's htdocs directory. Create a database 
named vanilla via the MySQL prompt or phpMyAdmin 
GUI. Visit http://localhost/vanilla in the browser, assuming 
the directory name under htdocs is vanilla. Fill the form 
with the username (admin role), the password and enter the 
database name as vanilla. Submitting the form will take you 
to the Vanilla administration page.
Customisation
Homepage layout: Vanilla has options to select the 
homepage of every user, to suit their interaction mode. The 
choice is between discussions view, categories view and 
activity view. Discussions view shows all discussions in 
reverse chronological order, in any category. The categories 
view groups discussions based on category, and only shows 
the discussion and comments count. The activity view shows 
new posts and new users added to the forum.
Banner customisation: The forum banner can be 
customised to suit the kind of forum being hosted—including 
changing the title and logo. Figure 3 shows a changed logo.
Look and feel selections: Vanilla has options to change 
themes and layouts based on user devices. The default theme 
is for desktops, but there are also embed-friendly and mobile 
viewing versions.
Messages to the community: As administrator, you can set 
information-based (e.g., new categories created) and warning 
messages (reminders of forum rules and company policies) on 
any of the pages on the forum. You can choose not only the 
messages, but also which page to display them on, where to 
display them, and whether or not the user can close the message. 
You can also enable or disable the appearance of a message.
User addition: User addition can be done by the 
administrator or through the self-registration option, which 
is best for a community that's growing large. Administrators,

however, can assign new account permissions based on the 
role the user will perform.
Roles and permissions: The roles define the amount of 
control a user has on moderation of discussions and over 
other users. At the very minimum, the users will be able to 
view their own profiles. At the other end of the spectrum is 
the administrator, who has full control over users, themes, 
moderation, categories management and spam control.
Registration: Many modes of registration are supported. 
The basic method lets the users choose a username and 
password, and requires them to enter CAPTCHA words 
for sign-up. The CAPTCHA security check should be 
configured by using the Google service. Another interesting 
registration process is 'registration through invitation'—the 
same way GMail became popular, through invitation emails 
for new users to join.
Moderation: The forum gives you many options to 
control spam and posts as well as create ban lists.
Discussion categories: Categories, like directories on a 
file system, separate topics of discussion, and let users focus 
on discussions they prefer.
Flood control: This feature moderates the rate of posts to 
avoid some users hogging the discussion (or, in Internet use, 
automated posts).
Archive discussions: Based on the volume of posts, 
administrators can choose to archive older posts by date. This 
helps to reduce the clutter on the home page.
Tagging: The author of a discussion can create tags 
for easy search. Tagging is a non-hierarchical way of 
grouping discussions. More than one tag can be assigned to 
a discussion. For example, a post on the ‘SRK controversy 
at Mumbai stadium’ can have the tags of ‘cricket’, ‘ipl’, 
‘bollywood’ and ‘mumbai’.
Plug-ins
Version 2.0.18.4 of Vanilla comes with 16 plug-ins as part 
of the software bundle. The plug-ins include integration 
with Internet communities like Facebook, Google, OpenID 
and Twitter; and have value-add features like a WYSIWYG 
editor, statistics, etc. In addition, the administrator can 
select plug-ins from a repository of hundreds of them at 
vanillaforums.org.
Promoting adoption
Setting up the forum is the easiest part; the real challenge is 
to get people to use it. Web 2.0 collaboration sites like blogs, 
wikis and discussion forums thrive on the ‘network effect’; 
the more people that join, the higher is the value to all. So 
here are some tips to promote the forum, which will be useful 
in the early days after the launch.
1. Analyse the purpose of forming the 
discussion group
Identify the main purpose of the discussion group. Is it to 
discuss ideas on innovation or for discussing anything under 
the sun? Though the group could later change the scope of the 
discussion forum, provide a clear objective.
2. Identify popular categories
Create high-level categories that are of interest to the group 
the forum caters to. At least have a few initial threads of 
discussion that allow new users to participate.
3. Identify the influencers
It takes a few highly motivated influencers to get started 
with such endeavours. Identify them, and ask them to share 
their valuable thoughts through this means. Paradoxically, 
most talented people may not be the best writers, and the 
best writers may not be the most talented! The challenge is 
to identify the right mix for your discussion forum.
4. Focus on content first, then the number of 
users
Never make the mistake of advertising the discussion forum 
to all as soon as it's launched. New users visit the place, 
see the empty forum, and may never return. First focus on 
having engaging discussion threads. Then, preferably, use the 
option of ‘registration by invitation’, so that news about the 
discussion forum spreads by word of mouth.
5. Have patience
It could takes weeks or months for people to visit and 
evaluate the discussions. The Vanilla statistics feature will 
give you an indication of the level of activity, so that you can 
measure the traction. When you feel that interaction levels 
have come down, introduce a new plug-in, and advertise it on 
the main page using the ‘Message’ option.
6. Remember to back up periodically
The biggest lesson I have learnt from hard experience is to 
have periodic (daily or weekly) back-ups of the discussion 
database.
Setting up and promoting a discussion forum using 
Vanilla is fun, and worth the time spent. It could become the 
most happening thing in your organisation.

A 
couple of questions: What is IPC? And do normal users 
require it often?
IPC occurs when processes exchange data through some 
communication channel. For a general-purpose OS, processes 
do not access the memory of other processes due to protection 
mechanisms. So IPC is essential for when a process needs 
data from another process.
Implicitly, we may use IPC every day. Browsing the 
WWW is an example. Here, the processes involved are the 
local browser and the remote Web server. The communication 
channel is the Internet, and the protocol is HTTP. Another 
example is if we run the ‘command pipeline’ who | wc –l to 
print the number of users logged in on the system. This also 
is an IPC technique. Thus, we often use IPC techniques when 
we work.
Broadly, we can classify common or widely available IPC 
techniques in three groups: pipes and FIFO; message queues, 
shared memory and semaphores; and sockets. The first group 
has process-persistent IPC techniques—these IPC objects are 
available while the processes that use them are running. The 
second group of IPC objects is kernel-persistent; they are 
available till the system reboots, or they are explicitly deleted. 
The third group of IPC objects can help us communicate over 
a network. Groups 1 and 2 are generally used to communicate 
between processes on a single computer.
In the subsequent sections, we will look at algorithms 
and C code to use some of these IPC objects to implement a 
generic sender and receiver. I have provided the algorithms 
as pseudo code, which you can use for reference, to improve 
the code. I mainly focus on the core concepts and avoid 
explaining too many syntactic details, which you can learn 
from the Linux manual pages.
 Note: Source code is omitted for brevity; please 
download it from http://www.linuxforu.com/article_source_
code/sept12/inter_process_communication.zip.
Pipes and FIFO
In the previous section's example, the who|wc –l command 
used a communication channel called a pipe. A pipe has two 
ends ( represented by descriptors)—read and the write end.

Overview
In this article, we explore the basic inter-process communication (IPC) techniques 
that are available.
The Need for Various Types of IPC Objects
Inter-process Communication

Now, open the FIFO to get the file descriptor, 
which can be used for subsequent reading or writing to 
or from it. If you try to open a FIFO for reading, but 
no process has opened it for writing (or vice-versa), 
the program blocks in the call to open the FIFO. To 
avoid this, I have used the O_RDWR flag to specify 
opening in read or write mode. Other functions like 
read/write, which are used for files and even sockets, 
are known to you from our discussion of file systems. 
When the user enters exit, the sender breaks the loop, 
deletes the FIFO and exits.
Differences between FIFO and pipes
At the beginning of the section, I mentioned pipes, 
but we've just looked at an example of a FIFO. Is 
there any difference? Yes! Here, the communicating 
processes are not ‘related’, but when using a pipe, you 
can only communicate between related processes—
those with common ancestors or the result of a fork 
call. This is because a FIFO has a name (and so is 
sometimes called a named pipe) whereas a pipe does 
not have any name. You can try rewriting this code 
using a pipe. A hint: please read the man pages for the 
pipe and dup functions. You could also try writing the 
who | wc –l, or could try to enhance the simple shell, 
from the process part of this article, to support pipes.
System V and POSIX IPC objects
The IPC objects in Group 2 are called System V 
IPC objects, because they originate from System 
V UNIX. Most systems nowadays have POSIX 
implementations of these—and the functions used to 
create and use them in each implementation (System 
V and POSIX) differ. We will extend the earlier 
simple FIFO IPC example to use a System V message 
queue, and also to use System V shared memory 
along with a POSIX semaphore.
The question now is how to uniquely identify 
an IPC object that several processes use to 
communicate between each other? These processes 
may be unrelated and may run at different times. 
Here, System V takes a key-based approach (that 
is a number), while POSIX takes a name-based 
approach. This means that all processes that need to 
communicate through a System V IPC object must 
know a number that's used to index the particular IPC 
object. On the other hand, processes communicating 
via POSIX IPC objects need to know the object's 
name, which is like a filename (though the IPC object 
is not an ordinary file) to uniquely identify an IPC 
object they can use for communication.
The POSIX interface also allows for memory-
based IPC objects (stored in memory). These name-
based IPC objects can be used by threads, since 
A process can read data from the read end and the data 
can be written on the write end. In our example, the who 
command writes to the pipe, and the command wc –l 
reads from the pipe. This can be implemented by a C 
program, but I leave this for you to try, with some hints at 
the end of this section.
Here's the algorithm for a sender and receiver using a 
FIFO object.
Sender
Create a FIFO. (If already created then proceed).
Open the FIFO for Reading/Writing.
While (1) {
      Read from Key board.
      Write data read from user to FIFO.
      If User enters “exit”
 then break the loop.
}
Delete FIFO and exit program.
Receiver
Create a FIFO. (If already created then proceed)
Open the FIFO for Reading/Writing
While (1) {
      Read data from FIFO
      Print the read data on the screen
      If received data is “exit” then break the loop.
}
Program terminates.
The C programs for the two blocks of pseudo-code 
above are in the downloaded archive as fifo_sender.c 
and fifo_receiver.c. Compile each, preferably naming the 
output as sender and receiver, run them in two different 
terminal windows and test them out.
Please note the function to create a FIFO is mkfifo. 
The name for the FIFO is accepted as a command-line 
argument to the program; the S_IRWXU flag is for 
specifying access permissions to the FIFO. You can 
check the man page (run man 2 open in a terminal) 
for the open system call, which will show you the 
detailed list of symbolic constants available for file 
access permissions. If you run an ls, you should see 
the created FIFO in the list.

threads share a common address space. They can also be 
used by processes, but then the memory in which they 
are stored needs to be shared between processes, like 
say, Shared Memory. We will not go into the details of 
POSIX memory-based implementations at this stage.
Example: Sys V IPC object:  
message queue
Now, let's implement the sender-receiver code using a 
System V message queue. Here's the algorithm.
Sender
Generate key (say K) using ftok library function
Create/Get Access to the Message Queue (The key K is needed 
here)
While (1) {
      Read from keyboard.
      Create a message.
      Send the message to the message queue
      If user has entered “exit” break the loop.
}
Delete message queue and exit program.
Receiver
Generate key (say K1)
Create/Get Access to the Message Queue (The key K1 is needed 
here)
While (1) {
      Read data from the Message Queue.
      Print data on the screen
      If received message is “exit” then break loop.
}
Program terminates.
The C programs (msg_sender.c and msg_receiver.c) 
can be downloded from the e-download archive. Compile 
them as before and run in two terminal windows. You can 
use the ipcs command to list System V IPC objects on the 
system and check that the message queue has been created.
Now, let’s understand the code. We used the ftok 
function to generate a key (a number), which should be 
unique and available to all programs that want to refer 
to a particular message queue. The choice of arguments 
(the filename ‘msg_receiver.c’ and ‘B’) is completely 
arbitrary, but you should use the same parameter in all 
programs using the queue. Also, the first argument should 
be an existing file. (You might use a file name like ‘test’ 
before running the code, and then create the file by running 
the command touch test in the directory where you're 
executing the program.)
Creating or accessing an existing message queue is 
done by the msgget function, which takes the key value 
and some additional information. In this example, use the 
permission bits with the predefined constant IPC_CREAT, 
joining them with the or operator. The IPC_CREAT 
constant creates the queue if it does not exist. The return 
value is the message queue descriptor, which then can be 
used as an argument to functions operating on the queue 
(reading from it, writing to it or deleting it).
Note the formation of a message. It is a C language 
structure:
struct msbuf {
        long mtype;
        char mstore [80];
}
The first element must be of the long type, and it can 
have any type of subsequent elements. In my example, the 
second element is an 80-character array.
An important feature of Sys V message queues is that 
the receiver can selectively retrieve messages based on the 
first element of the message structure. This feature is not 
available in pipes or FIFO, where readers can only read 
data in first-in-first-out order.
The functions msgsnd, msgrcv and msgctl send and 
receive messages, and delete the queue respectively. I 
have explained the msgsnd arguments in code comments. 
They are similar to those of the msgrcv function, which 
waits for the arrival of a message in the queue; whenever 
it receives a message, it returns from its blocked state. 
Note that the original message is removed from the queue 
when the msgrcv function returns. 
If multiple messages are available in the queue, which 
will be retrieved? Based on the fourth argument to msgrcv, 
the type fields of messages in the queue are compared, 
to decide which message to retrieve. In our example, the 
value is 1, so the first message with a type value of 1 will 
be retrieved. There can be other retrieval schemes based 
on the fourth argument, for which you can consult the 
man page.
Finally, we have used the msgctl function with the 
constant IPC_RMID to delete the message queue.
(Please note: Just like the ipcs command displays IPC 
objects, the ipcrm command can be used to delete System 
V IPC objects from the shell prompt.)
The other functions are System V message-queue-
related functions (browse the manual pages to learn more 
about them).
Shared memory and semaphores
Processes normally do not share memory. The memory of 
a process image (like stack, global data and heap) belongs 
to that process, and cannot be shared, as we saw when 
discussing fork in the processes article. But you can create 
memory that can be shared between multiple processes.

Acknowledgements
This is a faster mechanism of communication, since after 
creating and attaching shared memory to a process, you do 
not need any special function calls to access it. It simply 
behaves like normal data storage (a variable or array). But 
if multiple processes simultaneously read or write shared 
memory, race conditions can occur. Avoid that by using a 
synchronisation object like a semaphore. (Please refer to any 
standard OS textbook or the Internet for more details on race 
conditions and semaphores, if needed.)
Let us now implement the program using shared memory 
(using System V functions) and a semaphore (using POSIX 
functions). Algorithms follow:
Sender
Generate key (say K1).
Create/Get Access to the Shared Memory (The key K1 is needed 
here).
Attach the Shared Memory to the process address space.
Create a Semaphore (named put)
Create a Semaphore (named get)
Initialise get to 0.
Initialise put to 1.
While (1) {
      Read from Key board.
      Wait for semaphore put   to become 1
      Write User Input to Shared memory.
      Update semaphore get to 1
      If user input was “exit”then break;
}
Delete shared memory.
Delete semaphores get and put.
Program terminates.
Receiver
Generate key (say K1).
Create/Get Access to the Shared Memory (The key K1 is needed 
here).
Attach the Shared Memory to the process address space.
Get Access to the Semaphore get.
Get Access to the Semaphore put.
While (1) {
         Wait for semaphore get to become 1
         Read data from Shared Memory
         Update semaphore put to 1
         If read data is “exit” then break the loop.
}
Program terminates.
The C code implementations are shm_sender.c and shm_
receiver.c. Compile (please use the linker flag –lrt here) and 
run as before (run the sender first, since the semaphores are 
created in the sender).
Now let's look at the code. The same key is generated by 
both programs, so they can refer to the same shared memory 
segment (just like in the message queue example). Before 
you can use the shared memory, it needs to be attached to the 
process address space using the shmat function, which returns 
a pointer that can be used to read or write the shared memory. 
To avoid race conditions on simultaneous read/writes to 
the shared memory, two semaphores are used. Here, the sender 
creates both the semaphores and initialises them. The function 
for creating or accessing the POSIX named semaphore is sem_
open. The semaphore is identified by a name; I have used get 
and put. You may use any other name, but use the / character, 
so that all processes refer to the same semaphore. Here, if the 
reader runs first, it will be able to immediately write to the 
shared memory, since the initial value of the put semaphore 
is 1. After writing data, it updates the get semaphore to 1, so 
that the receiver, which was waiting on the get semaphore, can 
now read data. Similarly, now the sender waits, till the receiver 
successfully reads the shared memory. The semaphores ensure 
that no race conditions occur. After the user enters ‘exit’, the 
semaphores and the shared memory are deleted using the sem_
unlink and semctl function by the sender.
Observations
Message queues offer more flexibility in terms of message 
storage and retrieval. Shared memories are fast; after creating 
and attaching shm, you don't need to call special functions to 
read or write data. However, you need to be cautious about 
possible race conditions, and use semaphores to prevent them.
I hope you enjoyed reading this introductory article and 
start using what I’ve featured in applications.

A 
widely known secret among programmers, who are under 
pressure to be ‘productive’ and churn out hundreds and 
thousands of lines of code every day, is to make extensive 
use of two commands: Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V !
So just how much code is duplicated in real world software? 
We don’t know about closed source software, but for open source 
software, a study showed that 8.7 per cent of GCC, 19 per cent 
of X Windows, 22.7 per cent of Linux and 29 per cent of JDK 
consisted of duplicate code! For any seasoned programmer, these 
numbers are not at all a surprise. So, instead of talking about why 
code duplication occurs, let’s discuss the impact or consequences 
of copy-paste programming. Before that, let us briefly go over the 
kind of code duplicates (a.k.a. code clones) that abound.
Type 1 clones: An exact copy without modifications, 
except for white spaces, new lines and comments.
Type 2 clones: Syntactically identical copy, with only 
variable, type or function names changed.
Type 3 clones: A copy with modifications, such as 
statements changed, added or removed.
Apart from these three types of clones, we also have a fourth 
kind: code segments that semantically do the same thing, but 
are syntactically different. These clones cannot be detected 
automatically by clone analysers, but need to be found manually.
A common mistake while copying code is that 
programmers copy code, but forget to make the relevant 
changes necessary for the copied code to be used in the context 
into which it has been copied. For this reason, Type 1 and Type 
2 clones can result in bugs.
All types of code clones are undesirable, but Type 3 
clones (copy with modifications), also known as ‘inconsistent 
clones’, are especially prone to bugs. This is because in Type 
3 clones, a code block is copied, and changes are made that 
are inconsistent to the original intent of the code segment. In 
this case, the code is syntactically correct, but semantically 
incorrect, resulting in bugs. For example, in Eclipse 3.2.2, 
the file FeatureExportWizard.java had code identical to code 
in PluginExportWizard.java, indicating copied code. Further, 
there was a statement target.appendChild(export); that 
was missing in FeatureExportWizard.java, which led to an 
incorrectly formed XML ﬁle; this problem was also filed as a 
bug (ID 155070).
There is another problem with code clones. If the original 
code segment has a bug, and if the code is copied, the bug 
propagates! For example, a defect in Mozilla (Bug ID 217604) is 
a code block containing a bug that was copied in 12 places! So if 
the same piece of code is copied in 10 different places, obviously 
it’s difficult to make changes to all the duplicated code segments 
when fixing the problem. So, most programmers fix only the 
code clone piece on which a bug was raised—in all other unfixed 
clones, the bug lurks, only to be discovered much later. Hence, 
code clones can affect the reliability of applications as well, 
which most programmers don’t understand or appreciate.
If the code is duplicated in many different places, it becomes 
more difficult to understand or comprehend the code. Why? The 
human mind can hold only a limited number of chunks or items in 
working memory (known as the ‘Seven plus or minus two rule’), 
so the amount of information we can process at a time is severely 
limited. Because code duplication tends to ‘bloat’ code, it increases 
the complexity of the software code base. Hence, the main impact of 
code clones is on the maintainability of the application.
How do we know which code clones are serious, and which 
ones to address first? A practical way is to prioritise each set of 
code clones, based on the following formula:
Clone severity = the number of code duplicates * the 
number of lines of code duplication * the nature of 
code duplication (Types 1, 2, 3 or 4—the higher it is 
in this sequence, the more severe it is) * distribution 
of clones (intra-file, intra-module, inter-module—the 
higher, the more severe it is).
Now, how does one detect code clones? These days, real-
world (open as well as closed source) software applications easily 
cross a million lines of code. Manually finding duplicate code 
segments is impossible in such large code bases, and the only 
practical option is to use automated clone detection tools. Given 
the importance of detecting code clones, it is not surprising to 
see a proliferation of automated tools—both commercial and 
open source—to detect duplicate code. For example, Simian 
is a commercial tool (see www.harukizaemon.com/simian) and 
PMD’s CPD (Copy Paste Detector) (see pmd.sourceforge.net/
cpd.html) is an open source tool. However, remember that clone

When programmers are in a hurry to get work done, they 
sometimes practice ‘copy-paste programming’. In this column, 
we take a closer look at the consequences of this practice.

detectors can detect only syntactically similar code blocks, 
and not semantically similar ones (which we discussed a bit 
earlier). Even with this disadvantage, it is tempting to use 
clone detectors because most of them are:
1) 	 Programming-language-agnostic, or handle multiple 
programming languages;
2) 	 Quite fast—they often process millions of lines of code 
in a few hours;
3) 	 Fairly precise in finding code clones, with only a small 
percentage of ‘false alarms’;
4) 	 Command-line tools and can be integrated as part of 
regular builds (for regular monitoring);
5) 	 Free or quite affordable (unlike costly static and dynamic 
code analysers for detecting bugs).
There are specific kinds of code clone detectors that are 
extraordinarily costly! Can you guess why?
Given a tight deadline, programmers working in 
software companies sometimes copy code segments they 
get through search engines, and use these in the code 
they develop. Of course, this is a dangerous practice; 
the consequences of copying from open source software 
to an enterprise software code base can be serious. So,

software companies want to make sure that they are safe, 
and their code base is free of any code segments from 
open source—for which they purchase specialised clone 
detector tools, which can be quite expensive! 
How do these tools work? They maintain a database of 
open source software, and apply sophisticated clone detection 
techniques to check if there are any copies of open source 
code segments in the given code base. Real world enterprise 
software code bases often exceed a million lines of code. 
Because the database of open source software is so vast, and 
the tool has to check for small code segments from the large 
enterprise code base, it takes many days (or even weeks) to 
complete running such tools! Because of their specialised 
nature, these clone detector tools are extremely costly and 
there is a micro-industry of companies selling these tools!
So, do you now agree that using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to 
meet that all-too-important deadline is dangerous?

M
ost people are familiar with centralised version control 
systems such as Subversion, in which every action 
requires connectivity to the (Subversion) server. If the 
central server fails, all collaborators that depend on the server 
will be affected, and any data access using the central repository 
will stop. Distributed version control systems (DVCS) do not 
rely on a central repository server; rather, each user has a full 
copy of the repository. Whenever the main server fails, you can 
recover the server from the individual repository copies.
Git combines the best of the earlier DVCS used to 
maintain the Linux kernel. It is designed on the principles 
of speed, simplicity, scalability, integrity of data, non-
linear development and being fully distributed. Before 
learning Git, please forget everything you know about 
version control systems—because Git breaks all the 
traditional practices and workflows about version control 
systems that you may be familiar with. Git is modelled like 
a UNIX filesystem rather than a version control system. 
Integrity of data is implied by its design. If some files are 
modified or corrupted, Git itself can identify it by default. 
Since understanding Git's workflow and internals helps a 
lot, this article walks you through basic Git terminology 
and the initialisation steps, then moves to a hands-on 
workflow, which illustrates how to use it while coding.
Installation
You can install Git from source code, or from your distro's 
package management system. To install from the latest 
source, use the following commands:
$ wget http://git-core.googlecode.com/files/git-1.7.9.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvvf git-1.7.9.tar.gz
$ cd git-1.7.9
$ make install
On Ubuntu, a simple sudo apt-get install git-core will do 
the needful.
Basic terminology and concepts
Blobs, trees and commit
These are the three main data structures used in the Git 
version control system. A blob is used to hold a single file. 
A tree is an object used to model a directory that contains 
files, as well as other sub-directories (a tree holds blobs and 
sub-trees). A commit holds the current state of the repository. 
It points to a tree.
Let's get more details on the concepts. A blob is a binary 
file with the file named as the SHA1 hash of that file. A tree 
is a binary file that stores references to blobs and trees, also 
named as the SHA1 hash of the tree object. A commit is again 
named by the SHA1 hash. These hashes are used for naming, 
in order to ensure the integrity of data. In Git, files are not 
addressed by name. Everything is content-addressed. Every 
commit object has a pointer to the parent commit object. From 
a given commit, you can reverse-traverse by looking at the 
parent pointers (like a linked list) to check out the history of the 
commits. If a commit has multiple parent commits, that means 
the particular commit is created by merging two branches.

Insight
Version control systems help programmers keep track of the code they write, and also 
help them code in collaboration with others. They are very helpful in organising code 
based on different purposes, versions, in merging different pieces of code, and have 
many other interesting uses. Git is a new-generation distributed version control system 
written by Linux Torvalds. This article is a starter guide to Git, and walks through its usage 
patterns, essential features, internals and how to collaborate with multiple developers 
using its  collaboration tools such as GitHub.
Git Version Control Explained!
WorldMags.net
WorldMags.net

When a Git repository is created, the root directory of 
the repository contains a special directory named .git, which 
contains all the data required for Git's functioning. All the 
binary objects (commits, blobs and trees) are stored in the .git/
objects sub-directory. When you add files into the repository, 
corresponding blobs are created. When you commit your 
change with a description, a commit object is created, and 
it references the current files in the working directory. 
When you modify a file, Git creates another copy of the file 
internally, and renames it as the SHA1 hash for that newly 
created file. Thus, Git handles content-addressable data. When 
some file is modified manually, Git will see the mismatch 
between the SHA1 of the file content and its name, and this 
makes it easier to preserve the integrity of the data.
The local repository
In Git, you have a full copy of the repository locally. 
Whatever changes you make are to the local repository. You 
can work offline without any connectivity to a master server 
and make commits to the local repository. To sync changes 
to the master server, you can add the remote repository and 
push changes into it, or sync your local repository with new 
changes in the remote repository.
The working directory and staging area
The working directory is the repository directory where files 
are checked out. Whenever you want to do a commit after 
making some modifications, unlike other version control 
systems, Git will not track the modifications made to all the 
files in the working directory. When you do a Git commit, it 
will look at the files added to the staging area. Only files in 
the staging area are considered for a commit. Basically, the 
staging area is a method by which you can selectively add 
files in the current working directory for a specific commit. 
Let’s suppose there are 10 files in the directory. You made 
modifications to four files, but changes to two files belong to a 
particular feature addition, and other modifications belong to 
some other feature. You don't want to commit changes related 
to two features in a single commit, but changes related to one 
feature in one commit, and other changes in another commit. 
The staging area helps you to do that, as follows:
 
git add file1 file2 file3 
…can be used to add files to the staging area, and then 
run git commit  to add those changes in the staging area to a 
new commit. After the first commit, add the other files, and do 
the next commit. The git add command basically moves the 
added files to the staging area; only added files are considered 
for a commit.
Every object in Git can be referenced by the SHA1 
hash (41 characters). Usually, you do not need to type 41 
characters—for any reference, only the first five characters of 
the hash are required.
Branches and tags
By default, Git uses the branch named master, which is 
just like trunk in Subversion—but the concept of branches 
is different in Git. A branch can be a short-lived branch 
or long-term, according to Git concepts. Usually we use 
short-lived branches (called topic-branches) to develop 
new features; once the feature development is complete, 
you can merge it back to the main branch (master) and 
delete the topic-branch. Creating and deleting branches is 
never expensive in Git. It is part of the Git workflow to 
create and delete branches.
Every branch is referenced by a branch head (HEAD)—a 
pointer to the latest commit in that branch. When you make 
commits to a branch, the head is updated with the latest commit. 
The heads of branches are listed in the directory .git/refs/heads/ :
$ cat .git/refs/heads/master
46bf1f4592a7f121438a16a9d5e20e16db239814
The contents of the master branch head file refer to the 
commit ID of the latest commit in the master branch.
Tags are very similar to branches—but the difference is 
that tags are immutable. Once you create a tag for a particular 
commit, even when you create a new commit, it will not be 
updated. Suppose you want to tag some particular commit as 
a version release, you create a tag and keep it.
You can refer to the latest commit in the current working 
branch using the shorthand ‘HEAD’. You can also reference 
parent commits from the latest current commits using 
HEAD~N  to reference the nth older commit from a particular 
moment. You can run git show HEAD to display information 
about the latest commit.
Fast-forward and conflicting merges
Merging is a common task when working with version-
control systems. Many people may work on the same source 
code, each developing different portions of it. At some point, 
you will need to merge all the code into the main branch. Git 
has its own interesting ways of merging code. There are two 
terms associated with merging code: fast-forward merge and 
conflicting merge. Let us represent our Git repository as a 
series of commits, each having a parent commit, except for 
the first commit:
A-B-C-D
Here, A is the first commit and B, C and D are next commits. 
D is the HEAD commit (the latest). One of the developers (Dev-
1) clones the repo to his local machine, and adds a few more 
commits. Let us represent his local repo as follows:
A-B-C-D-E-F
Dev-1 now needs to merge his changes back to the

main repository. He can easily do so  because no other 
change has been committed to the main repository by 
other developers. The difference between his local repo 
and the main repo is two commits (E and F); D is still 
the head commit in the main repo, so by applying E and 
F, he can make the main repo exactly the same as his 
local repo. This type of merging, without any conflicts, 
applying newly added commits to the parent repo, is 
known as fast-forward merge. 
Now, let’s look at a conflicting merge version of the 
above scenario: by the time Dev-1 made changes, some other 
developer (Dev-2) added some other changes to the main 
repo. The main repo now looks like what follows:
A-B-C-D-G
Now, when Dev-1 tries to merge, Git responds that a 
fast-forward merge cannot be done. Then Dev-1 has to 
rebase his code on top of the main repo, and resubmit to 
apply the patches, i.e., the developer has to fetch the code 
from the main branch, and apply his local commits on top 
of the commit G. This is fairly simple. Git provides easy 
methods to resolve conflicts. When Dev-1 tries to merge, 
it will say that the merge failed and ask him to manually 
resolve conflicts to continue—and will list the files in 
which conflicts exist. The developer can open the files and 
see that Git has inserted markers like '<<<', which separate 
code from the local branch and code from the other repo. 
You should then choose the correct lines of code that 
you need, make the necessary modifications to resolve 
the issues, delete the '<<<' markers and then continue 
the merge operation. The operation will succeed and the 
developer can sync the code to the main repo. Merges and 
merge conflicts can occur between different repositories as 
well as branches.
Basic usage
Let us learn the basic usage commands and flows for Git.
Setting up the identity
Initially, after installing Git, you need to set up the identity 
for the committer. You can either set a global identity for 
user-wide configuration, or create a repository-specific 
identity. For example, to set a global user identity, use the 
following commands:
$ git config --global user.name “Sarath Lakshman”
$ git config --global user.email “sarathlakshman@slynux.org”
If you want to set a repository-specific private 
configuration, change the working directory to a Git 
repository and invoke the above commands without the 
—global option.
You can list all the Git configurations with (repository) git 
config list, or (global) git config —global list. You can check 
the current user name and email with git config user.name and 
git config user.email.
Creating an empty repository
To create a repository in the current directory, use git init.
Adding files to the staging area
Every time you make a change to a file in the repository, 
you have to add that file to the staging area before making 
a commit. Use git add file1 file2 to add the file(s). It is also 
possible to select code chunks to be added from a file using 
the -p (prompt) option with add: git add -p filename. You 
can select the code chunk using the y/n prompt.
Committing changes from the staging area
When you run git commit, it asks for a commit message. A 
nice commit message has a one-line subject with a length of 
65 characters, and a multi-line description of 70 characters, 
separated by a blank line. The Git commit command takes the 
following options:

git commit -m “Message”

git commit -a (all modified files in the current directory 
are moved to the staging area and added to the commit)

git commit file1 file2 (If you want to move file1 and file2 
to the staging area and create the commit in one shot, files 
can be specified with git commit.)
If you created a commit, and think that the message was 
not right, or some more code should be added to the commit, 
you can modify the commit using –amend. To interactively 
modify the commit, step by step, use git commit –amend -i.
Looking at the Git log
Commit logs are very important for version control systems. 
To view the commit logs, use the following commands:
$ git log
$ git log -2 (show last two commits)
$ git log -p
The -p option stands for pretty. It also displays the 
differences between the last commits.
$ git log --since 'May 22 2012'
$ git log --before “2 days”
$ git log --after “3 days”
It is also possible to list the log related to a commit by 
giving the commit ID (hash) as the parameter to the Git log 
command (git log commit_id).
Status of the repository
The git status command is very important. It is used to display 
the current status of the repository, and will show the contents

of the working directory, the unmodified files, modified files 
and staged files.
Displaying differences
We can view the differences between different commits, 
or between the last commit and the modified files in the 
current directory, or staged files. To see the difference 
between the last commit and the changes made in the repo, 
use git diff. To see the difference between the last commit 
and the staging area (files added using git add, but not 
committed), use git diff --staged.
It is also possible to see the difference between a given 
commit ID and the current modified files with git diff 
commit_id. To see the difference between current files against 
a different branch, use git diff branchname. It is possible to 
see how many lines got added or removed using git diff --stat. 
To display the difference between the current repo and an nth 
old commit, use git diff HEAD~N.
Resetting or reverting changes
After making a change, you may later decide to remove it. 
The Git reset command is used to reset some changes. There 
are three different types of resetting—soft, hard and mixed. 
Let us look at each of them.
When you add some changes to the staging area using 
git add, and those changes haven't been committed, you 
can use git reset to remove those files/changes from the 
staging area. The actual changes made to the working 
copy of the file are unaffected. The default Git reset is 
equivalent to git reset –mixed.
If you want to reset the HEAD of the current branch to 
some commit, git reset –soft COMMIT_ID can be used. It will 
not destroy anything, but it will just reset the HEAD.
The hard option will do three things; it will clear 
the staging area, reset the HEAD to a recent HEAD 
or specified COMMIT_ID and delete the local file 
modifications.
Checking out
If you want to get files from a specified commit or branch, 
you can use git checkout branchname. You can also check 
out only a single file from a branch with git checkout 
master filename.
Cloning a remote repository
Any public Git repository can be cloned to a local repository 
using the git clone command, as git clone repo_path. Here, 
repo_path can be an HTTP URL, local UNIX-style path or 
SSH location.
Pushing local commits to a remote repository
You make changes to your local repository and also need 
to push the changes to the main repository frequently. You 
can push changes with git push remote_repo branchname. 
If you created your local repo by cloning the main repo, the 
remote_repo name will be origin. You can push the changes 
to the master branch with git push origin master. If it is a fast-
forward merge, it will succeed. If there are conflicts, you have 
to rebase your code and push it again.
Branches
In Git’s workflow, branches are very important. You can 
check which branch you have currently checked out using 
the git branch command, which lists different branches and 
shows a * mark on the currently checked out branch. 
You can create a new branch using git branch new-topic-
branch. You can switch between branches using git checkout 
branchname. There is a shortcut to create and switch to the 
new branch: 
git checkout -b newbranch.
A branch can be deleted using the -D option, such as git 
branch -D new-topic-branch.
Managing a remote repository
Often, you work on a local repository on your machine, but 
may need to sync with multiple remote branches. GitHub is a 
social code-hosting website that enables you to create remote 
repositories. Create a github.com account to play around and 
share your code.
You can list the different remote repositories that are 
linked to your local repository with git remote; add the –v 
switch for more verbose output. A remote repository can be 
linked to the current local Git repository with git remote add 
repo_name repo_path. For example:
$ git remote add my_test_repo git@github.com:slynux/coderepo.git
$ git remote #List remote repos for this repository
my_test_repo
All branches, including remote repo branches, can be 
listed with git branch -a. You can delete a branch from a 
remote repository with git push repo_name :branch_name. If 
the current repo is cloned from the remote repo, use git push 
origin :branch_name.
In this article, we have covered the essential concepts 
related to Git and the basic commands to work with it. My next 
article will cover more advanced features, including merges, 
rebasing, tagging, cherry-picking and an example workflow by 
integrating with GitHub. Happy hacking!

n last month’s column, we had looked at 
a few examples of closures. The official 
Wikipedia entry defines a closure as “…a 
function together with a referencing environment 
for the non-local variables of that function.” 
Well, while this definition does in fact cover 
closures, it fails to distinguish how closures 
are different from, say, function pointers in C/
C++. After all, a function has a referencing 
environment for globals in C/C++, and can be 
passed around through a function pointer—so 
does that constitute a closure? No, not really. Let 
us consider the example below:
var count = 20;
function incrementCount(int incr) {
         return count + incr;
}
assert( incrementCount(5) == 25);
Here, the function call to incrementCount() 
references the variable count, and hence 
the returned value is 25. Consider a slight 
modification of the above code:
var count = 20;
function incrementCount(int incr) {
         return count + incr;
}
count = 30;
assert( incrementCount(5) == 25);
Now the assert actually fails, and the return 
value from ‘incrementCount ’ is actually 35, not 
25. That is because the reference to the global 
variable ‘count ’ returns the current value of 
the variable ‘count ’, and not its value from 
the lexical scope reference of ‘count ’ in the 
function ‘incrementCount ’. Hence, the above 
two examples are not really closures. Therefore, 
a slightly improved definition would be that 
a closure is a function that has the following 
properties:

It can be passed around like an object.

It ‘remembers’ all variables that were in scope 
when it was created, so that these can be 
referenced by the called closure even though 
the parent function where the variables were 
defined is no longer in scope. 
The second property is the most difficult 
thing for a C/C++ programmer to understand. 
The question that crops up is: How can the 
closure function access the variables of the 
enclosing function when the latter has already 
returned, and its local variables have gone out of 
scope? Well, the answer to that is that JavaScript 
supports closures as first-class citizens, hence 
as long as there is a reference to the enclosing 
function’s locals by a closure function, the 
JavaScript runtime will not free up the local 
variables of the enclosing function. Hence, 
these variables remain accessible to the closure 
function, even though the execution of the 
enclosing function has completed.
Closures need to be supported as a feature of 
the language. Languages such as LISP, Scheme 
In this month’s column, the discussion on the features of JavaScript 
continues. For the last couple of months, what has been covered is 
dynamic languages such as JavaScript, and how they differ from 
traditional statically compiled languages like C/C++. In this month’s 
column, the focus is on an important feature of JavaScript—closures.

and JavaScript support closures, whereas C/C++ does not 
support them. Closures allow one way of encapsulating 
data with functions. In a language like C++, this is achieved 
by providing data members in a class, and having the 
class methods access these data members. The scopes of 
definition and of invocation remain the same. On the other 
hand, in JavaScript, closures are defined in one scope—say 
as inner functions enclosed by an outer function, and they 
can be invoked outside the enclosing function by being 
passed as a callback or return value. Let us consider the 
following example to clarify this:
function outer() {
  // Local variable that becomes part of the closure
  var count = 1000;
  var inner = function() { console.log(count); }
  return inner;
}
var myExample = outer();
myExample();
In the above example, there is the function ‘inner ’, 
which is enclosed by the function ‘outer ’. The function 
‘inner ’ references the local variable ‘count ’ of its enclosing 
function ‘outer ’. The function ‘outer ’ returns the ‘inner 
’ function as its return value, and this is assigned to the 
variable ‘myExample ’. Now when we invoke the function 
‘myExample ’ in the last line, what is the output of the above 
code snippet? You will notice that the output is 1000. In the 
above case, though the function ‘outer ’ has finished executing 
and returned, its local variable ‘count ’ still remains defined 
since it is part of the closure of the ‘inner ’ function. Hence 
the JavaScript runtime will not garbage-collect this as 
long as it is referenced by any closure. Let us consider a 
slight modification of the above example:
function outer() {
  // Local variable that becomes part of the closure
  var count = 1000;
  var inner = function() { console.log(count); }
  count++;
  return inner;
}
var myExample = outer();
myExample();
Now, what is the value returned by the above code 
snippet? Is it 1000 or 1001? Well, the answer is 1001. This 
essentially means that the closure variables are kept as 
reference and not as copy by value. Therefore, any update 
to these variables in their lexical scope is reflected in the 
closure, when the latter is invoked later. It may be useful to 
think of this as the JavaScript runtime retaining the enclosing 
function’s stack frame, as-is, without de-allocating it as long 
as there is a reference to it through a closure. Let us consider 
another example:
function myExample() {
  // Local variable that is  part of the closure
  var count = 1000;
  // Store some references to functions as global variables
  gOutput = function() { console.log(count); }
  gSetCount = function(my_val) { count = my_val; }
}
myExample();
gOutput();
gSetCount(2000);
gOutput();
In the above example, we have two global variables 
gOutput and gSetCount, which are assigned inner functions 
defined inside the function ‘myExample ’. These inner 
functions access the local variable ‘count ’ of the enclosing 
function ‘myExample ’. Hence, a closure is created for 
the enclosing function, and as a result both gOutput and 
gSetCount reference the same closure. Therefore when we 
invoke ‘gOutput ’ after invoking ‘gSetCount ’, we see that 
the output from ‘gOutput ’ is 2000. Also note that each 
individual invocation of the enclosing function instantiates a 
new closure. Consider the example code given below:
function myExample() {
  // Local variable that is  part of the closure
  var count = 1000;
  // Store some references to functions as global variables
  gOutput = function() { console.log(count); }
  gSetCount = function(my_val) { count = my_val; }
}
myExample();
gOutput();
gSetCount(2000);
gOutput();
myExample();
gOutput();
Now what is the last value outputted from the above 
code snippet? Is it 2000 or 1000? Well, it is 1000. This is 
because the second invocation of ‘myExample ’ instantiates 
a new closure, so that when gOutput is called in the last 
line of the above snippet, it outputs 1000. It is important to 
understand these internal semantics of closures—else it is 
easy to get tripped up by them. Let us next consider how 
closures and loops behave.
function constructList(list) {
  var my_list = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    var item = 'obj' + list[i];
    my_list.push( function() {console.log(item)} );
  }
  return my_list;

  var result_list = constructList([1,2,3]);
  for (var j = 0; j < result_list.length; j++) {
    result_list[j]();
  }
}
testMyList();
Can you guess what the output would be? The 
output is “obj3 ” repeated thrice. Can you explain why 
this is so? This is because all the three inner functions 
stored in ‘result_list ’ share the same closure. At the 
end of executing ‘ConstructList ’, the value of ‘i’ is 3 
in the closure created, and hence list[i] is 3. Therefore 
testMyList outputs ‘obj3 ’ thrice. We will explore loops 
and closures further in next month’s column.
My ‘must-read book’ for this month
This month’s ‘must-read’ book suggestion comes 
from our reader Praveen Kumar. He suggests the book 
‘JavaScript, the Definitive Guide’ by David Flanagan. 
According to Praveen, “This is a good book for any 
beginner who wants to get a deep understanding of 
JavaScript. Though it is verbose, it highlights all major 
language features, including browser DOM interaction, 
etc. Use this in conjunction with Doug Crockford’s book 
‘JavaScript—the Good Parts’.” Thank you, Praveen, for 
your recommendation.
If you have a favourite programming book or article 
that you think is a must-read for every programmer, 
please do send me a note with the book’s name, and a 
short write-up on why you think it is useful, so I can 
mention it in the column. This would help many readers 
who want to improve their coding skills.
If you have any favourite programming puzzles that 
you would like to discuss on this forum, please send 
them to me, along with your solutions and feedback, at 
sandyasm_AT_yahoo_DOT_com. Till we meet again next 
month, happy programming and here’s wishing you the 
very best!

main gate, you just gave your name; it could have been some 
criminal impersonating you. So, only after verifying that 
you are known to him does your friend let you in. That’s the 
second step of verification.
Google’s two-step verification
Two-step verification online works in a similar manner. 
Recently, Google introduced this feature as a part of its 
authentication process. Not many people might know about 
this, because it wasn’t explicitly advertised. I myself came 
to know of it when I saw a friend of mine using this. A basic 
Google search will show you how this can be enabled for 
Google account(s). How it works is really simple. First, you 
enter your username and password. If the details provided 
are correct, you are taken to the second step of verification, 
where you are required to enter a randomly generated code 
delivered by Google Phone Verification System (PVS) to your 
registered cell phone number either through IVR or SMS. 
Upon entering this code, you are successfully authorised and 
taken to your account page. In case you do not have your 
phone with you, Google provides some backup codes, which 
can be downloaded from the Account Settings page.
However, remember one thing -- with two-step 
verification enabled, users cannot use third-party 
applications like mail clients, push mail, etc, linked to their 
Google account with the direct password. They have to 
generate a one-time password for each application from the 
Accounts Security page. Again, a quick Google search will 
show you the exact process.
Personally, I recommend that readers enable this feature, 
as it enhances the security of your account and makes it 
almost impossible to hack.
Pre-requisites for this tutorial
Now let’s see how you can implement two-step verification 
in your Java applications. In order to cook this recipe, you 
will need the following ingredients: an SMS gateway account, 
Java SDK 6 or above, NetBeans 7.0 or above and the Java 
Mail API. I will cover some of these in brief below.
According to Wikipedia, an SMS gateway is “…a 
telecommunications network service that is used for sending 
or receiving Short Message Service (SMS) messages to or 
from a telecommunications network that supports SMS.” 
Read more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_gateway. 
For this exercise, I’ll be using a Direct-to-SMSC (email to 
SMS) gateway, which means that you can send an SMS via 
email. To understand this more clearly, let’s work through a 
simple exercise.
Browse to www.way2sms.com, which allows you to 
send free SMS, and create an account. Once it’s done, log 
in and click on Mail Alerts and click Activate (if it’s not 
activated). It’ll create an ID for your account (something 
like 12345678@way2sms.com) to which you can forward 
mails, and you’ll be notified of their arrival via SMS on 
Figure 1: The new Java application window 
Figure 2: The Projects panel and Workspace after adding the form
Figure 3: Basic layout for the Authentication Form
your registered mobile 
number. You can also 
send an email to this 
ID, and the subject 
of that email will be 
displayed in the SMS 
you receive. You will 
be using this Way2SMS 
ID later, so note it down 
somewhere.
There are innumerable for-pay gateway services, but 
what other free gateway options have we got? Did you 
know that many mobile operators provide a free Direct-
to-SMSC gateway? Just visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_SMS_gateways and find out your operator’s email-
to-SMS-alert address. 
Though free gateways will do for college projects or small 
applications, those developing a commercial application must 
opt for a paid service since there are ‘no free lunches’! Free 
SMS gateways have certain limitations like: the SMS cannot 
be sent to DND subscribers, the SMS might be delivered late 
or not at all, a limitation to the number of SMSs that can be 
sent per day, and so on.
Java and NetBeans

install the Java SDK if 
you don’t have it—get 
the latest from http://
goo.gl/zXjC. Instead 
of downloading 
these separately, you 
can also choose to 
download JDK7u5 + 
NetBeans from the 
above mentioned page. 
Since this article assumes 
that readers know core Java and have a working knowledge 
of NetBeans, its installation and certain other details (yet to 
come) are left to them.
Implementing two-step verification
Here’s a procedure to create a sample authentication form 
in NetBeans and modify it to implement the two-step 
verification functionality:
1.	 Launch NetBeans, select Files > New Project or press 
Ctrl+Shift+N.
2.	 In the New Project window, select Java under Categories, 
Java Application under Projects and click Next.
3.	 In the subsequent window, enter the Project Name as Two 
Step Ver to the Project Location, add TSV at the end (this 
will be the project folder created at the selected location), 
uncheck the Create Main Class check-box and click Finish. 
See Figure 1 for reference. The new project is shown in the 
Projects panel at the left of the main window.
4.	 Next, create a blank GUI form for authentication. Select 
Files > New File or press Ctrl+N. In the New File 
window, select Swing GUI Forms under Categories and 
JFrame Forms under File Types and click Next.
5.	 In the New JFrame Form window, enter the Class Name as 
AuthenticationForm, the Package as tsv, and click Finish. 
Observe that File AuthenticationForm.java is added to the 
project under the tsv package seen in the Projects panel. 
Also, a blank canvas now appears in the Workspace (Figure 
2). We’ll be using this to place the form elements.
6.	 On your canvas, add different form elements—four of 
them (3 JLabels, 1 JTextField, 1 JPasswordField and 1 
Jbutton) from Swing Controls in the palette on the right 
hand side of the main window. Create a basic layout for 
the Authentication Form as shown in Figure 3. Don’t 
worry about the text; you can format it in the next stage. 
However, you may change the size of the components to 
make the form look elegant.
7.	 To format the form, you need to set the text property 
of each component. Click a component, and in the 
Properties window (at the right of the main window) set 
the text property. See Figure 4 for an example. Similarly, 
set the text properties of the remaining components. 
Leave the text property blank for the JTextField and 
JPasswordField. See Figure 5 for reference. 
8.	 Your form is now ready to use, but it’s still ‘deaf’. 
In order to make it listen, you need to add an event 
listener for the Submit button. When a user clicks it, the 
listener will first validate the form for empty fields, then 
extract the text from the JTextField and JPasswordField 
and verify it against stored values (for this tutorial, 
hard-coded in the code itself). If successful, it sends a 
randomly generated 3-5 digit code to the users’ mobile 
phone and asks them to enter the same code. If the code 
entered matches the randomly generated code, the users 
have passed the two-step verification. To add an event, 
right-click the Submit button and select Events > Action 
> actionPerformed. This listener will listen to events 
triggered via the mouse as well as the keyboard for 
clicking the Submit button. It will create a method for the 
event listener, where you’ll place your event-handling 
code. It will also switch to Source view; to go back to the 
Design view, click Design.
9.	 In the event method, add the following lines of code. This 
code handles validation, the first step of verification, and 
it generates a random five-digit code that’ll be sent via 
email-to-SMS to the registered mobile phone number.
	
/*Declaring the container variables*/
	
String usrName, usrPassword;
/*Extract Username and Password from fields*/
usrName = jTextField1.getText();
usrPassword = jPasswordField1.getText();
	
/*Validating against empty fields*/
if(usrName.equals(“”))javax.swing.JOptionPane.
showMessageDialog(null, “Please fill the Username Field”);
else if(usrPassword.equals(“”))javax.swing.JOptionPane.
showMessageDialog(null, “Please fill the Password Field”);
	
/*Implementing first step of verification*/
else {
if(usrName.equalsIgnoreCase(“Sample User”) && usrPassword.
equals(“5amp73”)) {
javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,”Verified at Step 
1”);
/*Implementing second step of verification*/
/*Generating random code of 5 digits*/

The JavaMail API
You’ve now reached a point where you have to take a short 
detour. For your next step, you need something through which 
you could send an email to the Way2SMS ID using Java. Yes, 
the JavaMail API, the fourth and last ingredient. Using this 
API, you can write programs to send, receive and manage 
emails very efficiently in Java. The developers of this API 
have designed it so beautifully that application developers 
only have to write a few lines of code to get it running. It’s 
absolutely free to download from http://goo.gl/C38nv and is 
under active development. Download version 1.4.5, which 
is the latest at the time of writing this article. Follow these 
simple steps to integrate it with your Two Step Ver project:
1.	 Extract the zip file to the project folder (TSV in this case).
2.	 Switch to the NetBeans window and right-click Two Step 
Ver in the Projects panel and choose the Properties option.
3.	 In the Project Properties window, select Libraries under 
Categories and click Add JAR/Folder
4.	 In the Add JAR/Folder window, navigate to the JavaMail 
API folder, select mail.jar and click Open.
5.	 Click OK in the Project Properties window, and that’s 
it—you’re done.
Returning to the code—you need to add code to send 
the randomly generated code to the registered cell phone 
number through SMS. First add these lines at the beginning, 
as shown below:
package tsv;
import javax.mail.*;
import javax.mail.internet.*;
Now, replace /*<<To be continued….>>*/ with the 
following code:
/*Setting the mail server properties*/
            java.util.Properties props = new java.util.
Properties();
            props.put(“mail.smtp.host”,”smtp.gmail.com”);
            props.put(“mail.smtp.socketFactory.port”, “465”);
            props.put(“mail.smtp.socketFactory.class”,”javax.net.
ssl.SSLSocketFactory”);
            props.put(“mail.smtp.auth”,”true”);
            props.put(“mail.sptm.port”, “465”);
/*Creating a session and sending the code*/
            Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props,
            new javax.mail.Authenticator(){
            protected PasswordAuthentication 
getPasswordAuthentication() {
                return new PasswordAuthentication(“<Gmail 
Username>”,”<Password>”);}});
                try {
                    Message message = new MimeMessage(session);
                    message.setFrom(new InternetAddress(“<Gmail 
ID>”));
                    message.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.
TO, InternetAddress.parse(“<Way2SMS ID>”));
                    message.setSubject(String.valueOf(cd));
                    message.setText(“User Logged in “);
                    Transport.send(message);
                    } catch(MessagingException e){
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
/*Verifying the entered code*/
String rCode = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,”Please enter the 
verification code sent to your registered number?”);
if(rCode.equals(code))JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, “Second 
step of user verification complete”);
            else
               JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, “Wrong code 
entered.”);
The above code uses Gmail as the email-sending 
service, because it is the most commonly used. However, 
you can customise it as per your requirements; all you have 
to do is change the server properties in the above code. 
Please note, before compiling this code replace value tags 
(like <Gmail Username>) with actual values—else, of 
course, the code won’t work.
Finally, to compile and run this code, right-click 
AuthenticationForm.java in the Projects panel, and select 
Run File, or click the Play icon, or press Shift+F6. I have 
intentionally not shown the output, just to whet your curiosity 
and get you to try this for yourself.
Readers who wish to use this functionality in their 
applications are free to use the code shown here. It might need 
some customising based on your requirements, but otherwise, 
it’s ready to use. If you face any issues regarding this tutorial, 
contact me at the email ID below; in your mail, do include 
details of the errors you encountered.

How To

I 
was a very avid graphics programmer, using Turbo 
C (actually, using graphics.c, a library usually taught 
to engineering students during labs). Trying to push 
graphics.c to its limits, I got stuck with its very limited 
graphics functionality and maximum resolution. When I 
discussed this with a teacher, he introduced me to OpenGL. 
I tried a few programs, and got fascinated with the rich 
graphics experience and platform independence. I thought 
of sharing my experiences with graphics programming using 
OpenGL, and contacted the LFY editorial team members, who 
were ready to provide me a platform.
OpenGL basics
OpenGL (Open-source Graphics Library) has three 
major library header files: gl.h, glu.h and glut.h. The gl.h 
(‘graphics library’) is a low-level header file, with which 
you can draw lines, polygons, colour the background or the 
line, etc. The glu.h (‘graphics library utility’) is a medium-
level header. It uses the lower-level OpenGL functions, 
such as matrices for specific viewing orientation, rendering 
surfaces, etc. The glut.h (‘graphics library utility tool-
kit’) is a high-level library file and a window system-
independent tool-kit to hide the complexity of different 
window system APIs.
Installation
Now, we need a Linux-based OS (I use Kubuntu 11.10); a 
compiler (GCC); an editor (Kate, Gedit, Kwrite, etc); the 
OpenGL header files... and some basic knowledge of C 
programming.
Make sure your PC has an Internet connection. Open 
a terminal and run ‘sudo apt-get install gcc’, entering the 
password when prompted, to install GCC. Next, for the editor, 
run ‘sudo apt-get install kate’ (or gedit, kwrite or whatever 
This article covers some basics of graphics programming in C.

you prefer, instead of kate). For the OpenGL headers, run 
‘sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev’.
The ‘Hello World’ first step
Now for the classic first-time program. Open the editor, and 
enter the following code:
#include<GL/glut.h>
void main(int argc, char**argv) {
    glutInit(&argc, argv);
    glutInitWindowPosition(100,100);
    glutInitWindowSize(500,500);
    glutCreateWindow(“Hello World”);
    glutMainLoop();
}
Save the file as ‘basic.c’, and to compile it, run ‘gcc 
basic.c -l glut’ at the terminal. Run the compiled binary with 
‘./a.out’. Here, we have imported glut.h (in the GL folder). To 
locate it, run ‘whereis GL’ and it will give you the installed 
location, like GL: /usr/include/GL. There are just five basic 
functions used to create a window for drawing. The first, 
glutInit(), initialises the display. Then glutInitWindowPosition 
(int x, int y) specifies the screen location (upper-left corner) 
of the window. Next, glutInitWindowSize(int x, int y) 
specifies the size of the window; glutCreateWindow(char 
*string) names the window for identification, and creates it; 
andGlutMainLoop() is used to display the window and begin 
event processing. Figure 1 shows you how it appears.
The compilation command specified -l glut, which means, a 
link with the glut library file. By default, GCC names the output 
compiled binary ‘a.out’; to change it, specify the -o (output file 
name) switch—for example, ‘gcc begin.c -l glut -o hello’.
Change the background colour of a window
The OpenGL function glutDisplayFunc (void function_name) 
is used to specify a user function that will handle the display 
of a window. Let’s use this to change the colour of a window:
#include<GL/glut.h>
#include<GL/gl.h>
void display() {
	
glClearColor(1,0,0,0);
	
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
	
glFlush();
}
void main(int argc, char**argv) {
    glutInit(&argc, argv);
    glutInitWindowPosition(100,100);
    glutInitWindowSize(500,500);
    glutCreateWindow(“Hello World”);
    glutDisplayFunc(display);
    glutMainLoop();
}
Save it as ‘basic2.c’, compile and run it as in the earlier 
example. The result is shown in Figure 2.
The three GL functions we used to colour the window 
background are:

glClearColor(R, G, B, alpha): This is used to set the colour 
for a window. The numbers you can use for each colour are 
between 0 and 1; you can use float numbers like 0.1, 0.11, etc.

glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT): This clears the 
screen to the desired colour set by glClearColor.

glFlush() executes the commands to the screen rather than 
storing it in a buffer.
In the next part of the series, I plan to explore how to draw 
lines and triangles, and use keyboard inputs.

Contest
Here’s the latest CodeChef.com Challenge, your monthly dose of coding puzzles from 
India’s biggest coding contest!
About CodeChef: CodeChef.com is India’s first, non-commercial, online programming competition, featuring monthly contests in more than 35 different 
programming languages. Log on to CodeChef.com for the September Challenge that takes place from the 1st to the 11th, to win cash prizes up to Rs 20,000. So 
keep visiting CodeChef to participate in the multiple programming contests that take place on the website throughout the month!
S
olve  this month’s puzzle, and you could be one of the three 
lucky people to win a cash prize of Rs 1,000 each!
 
The August edition’s puzzle:
There is a village situated on a hill. It doesn’t have any 
resources of its own and hence everything has to be brought 
up from the city market. Every month the government sends a 
cart down to the market to buy what is needed by the people. 
While returning to the village, the cart gets overloaded every 
time. The cart is pulled by one horse at a time. One horse 
pulls the cart for 10 km and can be used only once in a day. 
There were three horses initially and after using them, the 
cart has to stop so that the horses get ready for the next 
day. But due to the load and inefficient braking system, the 
cart slides back 10 km. During the last day of the journey, 
one more horse joins the trio to help pull the cart. How 
many days will it take the cart to reach the village if the 
distance between the market and the village is 400 km?
The Solution:
According to the problem, three horses are used 
initially, so the total distance covered by them will be 
= 3 x 10 = 30 km
But due to the slope and inefficient braking system, 
the cart slides back 10 km. So, for each day with the 
3 horses, the cart can travel 30-10 km = 20 km ... 
Eqn (1)
Considering the last day’s scenario, there were 4 
horses so the cart got pulled 4 x 10 km that day. 
So the distance travelled on the last day = 40 km 
... Eqn (2)
Distance left  = total distance – distance travelled 
on the last day
	
= 400 – 40
	
= 360 km
The days required to cover the initial 360 km = 360/20 = 18 
days (using Eqn 1)
And on the last day, the distance covered = 40 km (using Eqn 2)
Hence, the total number of days taken = 19 .
And the winners this month are:
• Satyabrata Satpathy
• Syed Mohammed Khawar
• Ashish Monhe
Here’s your CodeChef Puzzle of the Month: 
There is a 50 cm long line of ants moving ahead. The last 
ant in the line had an urgent message to give to the queen 
ant, which is moving at the first position. So while the line 
is moving, it runs ahead, reaches the first ant and conveys 
the message and without stopping, it runs and comes back 
to its original position. (Consider that no time is lost in 
giving the message.) Meanwhile the whole line has moved 
ahead by 50 cm.
The question is how much distance did the ant with the 
message cover in that time—assuming that it ran the whole 
distance at a uniform speed.

C
tags, a tool used for code browsing, generates an index 
file containing entries for each language object in the 
source code. This index helps search for objects in the 
source code. A ‘tag’ is a language object for which there is an 
entry in the index file.
Ctags supports multiple programming languages—C, 
C++, C#, COBOL, Flex, Fortran, HTML, Java, JavaScript, 
Lisp, MATLAB, etc. For a complete list, see http://ctags.
sourceforge.net/languages.html. It also provides support for 
user-defined languages with regular expressions. 
It generates tags for C/C++ code objects including class 
names, macro definitions, enumeration names and enumerators, 
function definitions and prototypes/declarations, classes, 
interfaces, structs, union data members, structure names, 
typedefs, union names and variables (definitions and external 
declarations). It can also print a list of selected objects found in 
source files. It compiles on UNIX, MSDOS, Windows 95/98/
NT, OS/2, QNX, Amiga, QDOS, VMS, Macintosh and Cray.
Installing Ctags
To install, compile from the source. Get the latest version 
from http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ and follow the steps below.
 Note: The steps to build and configure Ctags on 
Linux and Cygwin are the same. I built and installed Ctags 
under Cygwin on Windows.
Go to the Downloads folder and extract the source with 
tar –xvf ctags-5.8.tar.gz. Make a separate directory, build_
ctags, with mkdir build_ctags. Change into the build_ctags 
directory, and then configure the source by running the 
configure utility in the extracted source. For example: /
cygdrive/c/Users/root/Downloads/ctags-5.8/configure
To build Ctags, next run ‘make’, followed by (as the root 
user) make install to install it. Check if the ctags command is 
available (on Windows+Cygwin, look for ctags.exe in the folder 
‘/c/cygwin/usr/local/bin’ ). If yes, the build was successful.
Using Ctags
The use of Ctags is illustrated by browsing through the source 
code of GCC. First, you need to generate a tag file. Change to 
the directory containing the source files you want to index. In 
the case of our example, go to the GCC source code with cd /
cygdrive/d/source_gcc/gcc-4.7.0/gcc/
Next, generate the tag file with the command ctags –R *, 
which will generate the tag file (named tags).
To use the vi editor with Ctags, start it up, and then, to find a 
specific tag, use the :ta <tag> command. For example, in Figure 
1, the tag ‘find_mode’ has been specified. This command should 
take you to the definition of the tag, as you can see in Figure 2.
To find all occurrences of the particular tag in the index, use 
the :ts command; the result, listing all the occurrences of the 
tag you searched for with :ta, is shown in Figure 3. To go to the 
location of a result, just type the option number and hit Enter.
Ctagging your way through source code
Use Ctags to navigate your way through source code:

If you want to jump to the definition of any other tag used 
in a particular function definition, use CTRL+].

Ctrl+T is used to step back to the location from where 
you started your search in the particular directory.
I hope this is enough to start using Ctags for browsing 
your source code. In the next article, we will discuss another 
tool, Cscope, which is used for the same purpose, and

W
ith the formatting of the pen drive, the file system 
is all set on the hardware. Now, it is time to 
decode that, using a corresponding file system 
module in kernel-space, and accordingly provide the user-
space file-system interface for it to be browsed like any other 
file system.
The five sets of system calls
Unlike character or block drivers, file system drivers involve 
not just one but five structures of function pointers, for the 
various interfaces provided by a file system. These are:

struct file_system_type: Contains functions to operate on 
the super block

struct super_operations: Contains functions to operate on 
the inodes

struct inode_operations: Has functions to operate on 
directory entries

struct file_operations: Contains functions to operate on 
the file data (through page cache)

struct address_space_operations: Has page cache 
operations for the file data
Along with these, came many new terms for Pugs. 
He found the following glossary handy when it came to 
understanding various terms used in file system module 
development:

Page cache or buffer cache: A pool of RAM buffers, 
each of page size (typically 4096 bytes). These buffers 
are used as the cache for the file data read from the 
underlying hardware, thus increasing the performance of 
file operations.

Inode: A structure containing the meta-data or the 
information of a file, like permissions, the owner, etc. 
Though the file name is part of the file's meta-data, to 
conserve space, in typical Linux file systems it is not 
stored in the inode but in a directory entry. A collection 
of inodes is called an inode table.

Directory entry: A structure containing the name and inode 
number of a file or directory. In typical Linux file systems, 
a collection of directory entries for the files and immediate 
sub-directories of, Directory D, for instance, is stored in the 
data blocks of the Directory D.

Superblock: A structure containing information about 
the various data structures of the file system, like the 
inode tables, etc. Basically, it's meta-meta-data (meta-
data for the meta-data).

Virtual File System (VFS): A conceptual file system layer 
that interfaces kernel-space to user-space in an abstract 
manner, showing ‘everything’ as a file, and which 
translates their operations from the user to the appropriate 
entity in the kernel space.
Each of the above five structures contains a list of 
function pointers, which need to be populated depending 
on what features are to be supported in the file system 
(module). For example, struct file_system_type may contain 
system calls for mounting and unmounting a file system—
basically operating on its super block; super_operations 
may contain inode read/write system calls; inode_
operations may contain a function to look up directory 
entries; and file_operations may generically operate on 
the page-cached file data, which may in turn invoke page

cache operations, defined in address_space_operations. For 
these various operations, most of these functions will then 
interface with the corresponding underlying block device 
driver to ultimately operate with the formatted file system on 
the hardware.
To start with, Pugs laid out the complete framework 
of his real SFS module, but with minimal functionality; 
good enough to compile, load and not crash the kernel. He 
populated only the first of these five structures—struct file_
system_type, and left all the others empty. Here's the exact 
code of the structure definitions:
#include <linux/fs.h> /* For system calls, structures, ... */
#include <linux/version.h> /* For LINUX_VERSION_CODE & KERNEL_
VERSION */
static struct file_system_type sfs;
static struct super_operations sfs_sops;
static struct inode_operations sfs_iops;
static struct file_operations sfs_fops;
static struct address_space_operations sfs_aops;
static struct file_system_type sfs =
{
    name: "sfs", /* Name of our file system */
#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,38))
    get_sb: sfs_get_sb,
#else
    mount: sfs_mount,
#endif
    kill_sb: kill_block_super,
    owner: THIS_MODULE
};
 Note that before Linux kernel version 2.6.38, the 
mount function pointer was referred to as get_sb, and it also 
used to have slightly different parameters—hence the above 
#if for it to be compatible at least across 2.6.3x and possibly 
with 3.x kernel versions (no guarantee for other versions). 
Accordingly, the corresponding functions sfs_get_sb and 
sfs_mount are also #if'd, as follows:
#include <linux/kernel.h> /* For printk, ... */
if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,38))
static int sfs_get_sb(struct file_system_type *fs_type, int flags, 
const char *devname, void *data, struct vfsmount *vm)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "sfs: devname = %s\n", devname);
     /* sfs_fill_super this will be called to fill the super block 
*/
    return get_sb_bdev(fs_type, flags, devname, data, &sfs_fill_
super, vm);
}
#else
static struct dentry *sfs_mount(struct file_system_type *fs_type, 
int flags, const char *devname, void *data)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "sfs: devname = %s\n", devname);
     /* sfs_fill_super this will be called to fill the super block 
*/
    return mount_bdev(fs_type, flags, devname, data, &sfs_fill_
super);
}
#endif
The only difference in the above two functions is 
that, in the latter, the VFS mount-point-related structure 
has been removed. The printk in there would display the 
underlying partition's device file, which the user is going 
to mount (the pen drive's SFS-formatted partition). The 
get_sb_bdev() and mount_bdev() functions are generic 
block-device mount functions for the respective kernel 
versions, defined in fs/super.c and prototyped in <linux/
fs.h>. Pugs also used them, as most other file system 
writers do. If you are  wondering if all file systems mount 
a block device the same way—well, most of them do; 
except the part where the mount operation needs to fill in 
the VFS' superblock structure (struct super_block) as per 
the superblock of the underlying file system—that, most 
probably, would be different. But then how do file systems 
do that? If you observe the above functions carefully, apart 
from passing all the parameters as-is, there is an additional 
parameter sfs_fill_super, and that is Pugs' custom function 
to fill the VFS' superblock as per the SFS file system.
Unlike the mount function pointer, the unmount function 
pointer has been the same (kill_sb) for quite some kernel 
versions; and in unmounting, there is not even the minimal 
distinction required across different file systems. So, the 
generic block-device unmount function kill_block_super() has 
been used directly as the function pointer.
In sfs_fill_super(), Pugs is ideally supposed to read the 
superblock from the underlying hardware-space SFS, and 
accordingly translate and fill that into VFS' superblock to enable

VFS to provide the user-space file-system interface. However, 
he is yet to figure out how to read from the underlying block 
device in kernel space. Information on which block device to 
use is already embedded into the super_block structure itself, 
obtained from the user issuing the mount command. But, since 
Pugs decided to get a bare-bones real SFS up first, he went 
ahead and wrote his sfs_super_fill() function also as a hard-
coded fill function. And with that, he registered the Simula file 
system with the VFS. As for any other Linux driver, here's the 
file system driver's constructor and destructor:
#include <linux/module.h> /* For module related macros, ... */
static int __init sfs_init(void) {
    int err;
    err = register_filesystem(&sfs);
    return err;
}
static void __exit sfs_exit(void) {
    unregister_filesystem(&sfs);
}
module_init(sfs_init);
module_exit(sfs_exit);
Both register_filesystem() and unregister_filesystem() 
take a pointer to the struct file_system_type sfs (filled 
above) as their parameter, to respectively register and 
unregister the file system described by it.
Hard-coded SFS superblock and root inode
And yes, here's the hard-coded sfs_fill_super() function:
#include "real_sfs_ds.h" /* For SFS related defines, data 
structures, ... */
static int sfs_fill_super(struct super_block *sb, void *data, int 
silent) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "sfs: sfs_fill_super\n");
    sb->s_blocksize = SIMULA_FS_BLOCK_SIZE;
    sb->s_blocksize_bits = SIMULA_FS_BLOCK_SIZE_BITS;
    sb->s_magic = SIMULA_FS_TYPE;
    sb->s_type = &sfs; // file_system_type
    sb->s_op = &sfs_sops; // super block operations
    sfs_root_inode = iget_locked(sb, 1); // obtain an inode from 
VFS
    if (!sfs_root_inode) {
        return -EACCES;
    }
    if (sfs_root_inode->i_state & I_NEW) // allocated fresh now
    {
        printk(KERN_INFO "sfs: Got new root inode, let's fill 
in\n");
        sfs_root_inode->i_op = &sfs_iops; // inode operations
        sfs_root_inode->i_mode = S_IFDIR | S_IRWXU |
            S_IRGRP | S_IXGRP | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH;
        sfs_root_inode->i_fop = &sfs_fops; // file operations
        sfs_root_inode->i_mapping->a_ops = &sfs_aops; // address 
operations
        unlock_new_inode(sfs_root_inode);
    }
    else {
        printk(KERN_INFO "sfs: Got root inode from inode 
cache\n");
    }
#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(3,4,0))
    sb->s_root = d_alloc_root(sfs_root_inode);
#else
    sb->s_root = d_make_root(sfs_root_inode);
#endif
    if (!sb->s_root) {
        iget_failed(sfs_root_inode);
        return -ENOMEM;
    }
    return 0;
}
As mentioned earlier, this function is basically supposed 
to read the underlying SFS superblock and, accordingly, 
translate and fill the passed struct super_block ( as pointed 
by the first parameter, sb). So understanding it is equal to 
understanding the minimal fields of the super_block struct, 
which are filled. The first three are: the block size, its 
logarithm Base 2, and the type/magic code of the Simula file 
system. As Pugs codes further, we will see that once he gets 
the superblock from the hardware, he would instead get these 
values from the superblock and, more importantly, verify 
them, to ensure that the correct partition is being mounted. 
After that, the various structure pointers are pointed 
at the corresponding structures of function pointers. Last, 
but not least, the root_inode pointer s_root is pointed to 
the struct inode structure, obtained from VFS' inode cache, 
based on the inode number of root—which right now has 
been hard-coded to 1; it may possibly change. If the inode 
structure is obtained fresh, i.e., for the first time, it is filled 
as per the underlying content of SFS' root inode. Also, the 
mode field is being hard-coded to “drwxr-xr-x”. Apart from 
that, the usual structure pointers are being initialised by the 
corresponding structure addresses. And finally, the root's 
inode is being attached to the superblock using d_alloc_
root() or d_make_root, as per the kernel version.
All the above code pieces have been put in together as

the bare-bones real_sfs_bb.c, along with the real_sfs_ds.h 
(based on the same file created earlier); these, and a 
supporting Makefile, are available from http://linuxforu.com/
article_source_code/sept12/rsfsbb_code.tbz2.
Bare-bones SFS module in action
Once compiled using make, getting the real_sfs_bb.ko 
driver, Pugs did his usual unusual experiments (see Figure 
1). He checked the kernel window /proc/filesystems for 
kernel-supported file systems, then loaded the real_sfs_
bb.ko driver and re-checked /proc/filesystems to find it 
showed sfs in the list. He mounted the pen drive partition /
dev/sdb1 onto /mnt using the sfs file system, checking the 
dmesg logs in the adjacent window. (Remember that right 
now, sfs_fill_super is not really reading the partition, and 
not doing any checks, so it really doesn't matter how /dev/
sdb1 is formatted.) But yes, the mount output shows that it 
is mounted using the sfs file system.
Oops! The df output, however, shows ‘Function not 
implemented’, and cd gives ‘Not a directory’. Aha! Pugs 
hasn't yet implemented any functions in the other four 
function-pointer structures. That's still left to be done.
 Note: The above experiments use sudo, but one could 
just get into a root shell and do them without a sudo.
Okay, so no kernel crashes, and a bare-bones file system 
in action—Yippee! 
Yes! Pugs knows that df, cd, … are not yet functional. 
For that, he needs to start adding the various system calls in 
the other four function-pointer structures so that, like other 
file systems, people can use the various commands. And yes, 
Pugs is already onto his task—after all, he needs to have a 
geeky demo for his final semester project.

L
ately, there has been a lot of talk about Crunchbang 
Linux in the FOSS community regarding its 
robustness, stability, and how productive it enables 
people to be. Some emphasise its Debian roots; though until 
version 9 it was based on Ubuntu. From version 10 a.k.a. 
Slatter, and the testing releases of version 11 Waldorf, the 
distribution’s base  switched to Debian 6 (Squeeze) and the 
testing version of Debian 7 (Wheezy), respectively.
Let’s give it a test run. The project’s website http://www.
crunchbang.org/ provides ISO images for the stable (ver 10) and 
testing (11) releases, both for direct downloads or via BitTorrent. I 
went for version 11 (Waldorf). I wanted to make a bootable USB 
flash drive, but UNetBootin failed to create a working image, so I 
used the method recommended by the official installation guide—
use the ‘dd’ utility found in almost all modern Linux distros. A 
single Google search led to a thread in the forums (which are very 
helpful). It described the process, with the exact commands to use. 
Note that this completely erases and overwrites your flash drive; 
so back up any data you want from the drive before you do this. 
Replace the path /home/aditya/downloads/crunchbang11.iso with 
the path to the ISO on your system, and ‘sdb’ with your system’s 
device node for your USB drive. Note that the image is not to be 
written to a partition of the flash drive (e.g., ‘sdb1’) but to the drive 
itself (e.g., ‘sdb’ ). Here’s the command I ran:
 Note: Although I have tried these steps and installed 
all software I recommend, and have found that it has in no 
way damaged anything on my Mac, I take no responsibility 
for any data or material loss, although there is absolutely no 
risk if the instructions are carried out properly.
sudo dd if=/home/aditya/downloads/crunchbang11.iso of=/dev/sdb 
bs=4M;sync
Installation was pretty straight-forward; i.e., graphical, like 
many mainstream distros. Partitioning the hard disk was simple 
with GParted. The installation took almost eight minutes, which 
is reasonable for a standard 5400 rpm hard drive.
The default desktop (Figure 1) is a hybrid of Openbox and 
XFCE with Conky and Tint2 panels, and effectively conveys 
the distro’s nature—functional minimalism. The default open 
source X.Org drivers supported my AMD-ATI and NVIDIA 
GeForce video cards well enough to play 3D games like 
Armagetron. All hardware on my Macbook Pro 7, ThinkPad 
x120e and ThinkPad x220 are supported out-of-the-box. 
Right after the first boot, you are presented with a script 
(Figure 2) to install LibreOffice, printer support, Java and 
LAMP tools, with other Debian development packages. The 
script also offers the following commands:
sudo apt get update
... and 
sudo apt get dist update.
 The script is quite a nice feature.
Moving on to default applications, VLC is the media 
player—no codecs problems so almost all media formats 
work. We have Thunar for file management and Terminator 
for the terminal emulator. 
Chromium is the default browser, Abiword the word 
processor and GNumeric is for spreadsheets. GCC and the 
basic GNU tool-chain are included, which is appreciated by 
all programmers. Plus we have Python 2.7, and Geany for the 
text editor or the IDE—just right for minimalists. There’s the 
(non-free but very precise) ANSI art software, Figlet, with the 
usual geek amusement trio: Fortune, Cowsay and Cowthink.
The system is as stable as any OS could be—although it’s 
labelled ‘testing’, it is quite stable compared to Ubuntu. In my own

How To
For resource-conscious Linux users, Crunchbang Linux is the right flavour. It is a 
Debian-based GNU/Linux distro that uses the nimble Openbox window manager, 
with pre-installed apps chosen for minimum load on system resources. Yet, it 
provides vast functionality, right out-of-the-box. This review comes along with a 
short ‘how-to’ for installing  it on Apple hardware.
Minimalist and Mac-Friendly
Crunchbang Linux

experience, I never had a single crash on any of my laptops. After 
using Crunchbang, my feeling about it tends towards evangelism; 
it is addictive because of its minimalism and simplicity.
Verdict
The pros:
•	
Great set of default applications.
•	
Great hardware compatibility out-of-the-box.
•	
Very light on system resources.
The cons: 
•	
No eye-candy.
•	
No icons on the desktop (GNOME users will find this 
annoying).
•	
No email client by default (although IceDove, the 
unbranded version of Mozilla Thunderbird can 
be quickly installed from Debian repos using the 
Synaptic package manager).
Crunchbang is a distro for people who want something in 
between the Xubuntu and a Debian install with an Openbox 
environment. If you are a minimalist who is addicted to 
Debian, then this is the distro of choice for you.
 Note: Crunchbang may take about 10 minutes for the first 
two to three boots, but after that, it is under two minutes always.
Installation on the Intel Apple Mac  
(dual-boot with OS X)
Here are the steps:
1.	 Click the diskutility.app icon in the utilities folder in 
Applications and resize your OS X partition according 
to your needs. Warning: just resize the partition—do not 
create a new partition, else you will lose all data on your 
OS X partition. Leave the hard disk space other than your 
OS X partition as ‘free space’.
2.	 Download and install ‘refit.dmg’ from www.refit.
sourceforge.net on your internal hard drive.
3.	 Reboot thrice. This is required as the MBR table of the 
apple EFI interface is stored in the R.O.M chips and it 
takes three attempts  to successfully rewrite data to the 
P.R.O.M. 
 Note: Don’t panic if, when you select your 
Linux partition, you see a white screen with Tux 
sitting in the centre—this is supposed to happen. This 
screen may seem to be ‘stuck’, but it is a front-end 
for the Linux kernel’s pre-bootstrapping processes, so 
don’t worry; let it take its time.
4.	 Install Crunchbang; when the disk partitioning options 
come up, click the Use Largest Free Space Available 
and then install the system. Ensure you select the GRUB 
(bootloader) destination as the /boot partition, and NOT 
the MBR, else your Mac will be unbootable, and will 
require a rescue boot with the Mac OS X Install DVD.
5.	 While rebooting, you will see the ‘Refit’ boot sequence 
screen. From it, select the partition utility, which is the 
second icon from the left in the second row of small icons. It 
will suggest synchronising the boot sequence list or the gpt 
partition table; press ‘y’ and then <Return> and if all goes 
well, you will be redirected to the refit screen. You will now 
be able to boot into your new Crunchbang install on your 
Mac—just select the Linux partitions icon.

here are a couple of ways to actually install a Linux 
distribution on a Mac. One way is to set up a virtual 
machine (VM) and install Linux into that. Another 
is to install natively (on the ‘bare metal’). We will be doing 
both here.
The Mac I used to write this article is an iMac 27 with 
a quad-core Intel Core i7, 8 GB of RAM, and 1 TB of hard 
drive space. A Mac with a more modest configuration will 
also fly with Linux. Loads of RAM and HDD space help the 
VM approach—after all, it would be cool to run both OSs 
simultaneously and at decent speeds, right?
Installing Linux in a VM
I chose to use the Ubuntu distro, and the virtualisation 
software is Oracle VirtualBox. The links are at the end of the 
article so visit the site and download a copy of VirtualBox. 
This would be a DMG file, which you need to mount, and run 
the MPKG file within it. Simple, right? Fire up VirtualBox 
after it's installed, and follow the steps below.
Click the New button in the main toolbar to bring up 
the Create a New Virtual Machine wizard. Press Continue 
to proceed from the introduction page. The VM Name and 
OS Type page tries guessing the guest OS from the name 
(clever, isn’t it?). If you were to name it something unique, 
select the Operating System as Linux and Version as Ubuntu. 
Click Continue to proceed. On the Memory page, leave the 
default of 512. Hit Continue. Again, leave the Virtual Hard 
Disk page as-is. The default 8 GB is more than sufficient, 
just as the dialogue box says. 
The next page asks about the virtual hard disk file format 
you want. Stick to the suggested VDI (VirtualBox Disk 
Image). Click Continue, and select Dynamically allocated 
in the details page. This way, it won’t chomp up 8 GB in 
one go. Next, enter a filename for the virtual disk; you can 
move the slider or enter a new value if you wish to modify 
the size. Hit Create on the summary screen; this completes

The Penguin in the Apple camp? As incredible as that sounds, there are many reasons to 
install Linux on the Apple Macintosh—an urge to take ol’ Tux for a spin, or maybe  migrate 
to freedom-land to avoid the increasing malware. Whatever the reasons, few geeks can 
pass up a chance to, as Mark Twain said, “Do the right thing; it will gratify some people and 
astonish the rest.” This article takes readers through the installation process.

install Ubuntu  (safe, since it's limited to the VDI virtual 
hard disk). On the next screen, simply click Install Now, 
and wait patiently as it copies files, installs, and configures 
hardware and the bootloader. In parallel, you will be asked 
for your time zone, keyboard layout and user credentials, 
which you need to provide.
Once the installer has completed, and prompted you 
to restart, do so. This brings you to your new Ubuntu 
installation running in the VM (Figure 2). This wraps up 
installation into a VM. After gaining confidence playing 
around with the VM, let’s up the ante and go native. 
Adventure makes life exciting, after all. Read on.
Installing Linux on the Mac natively
Native (‘bare metal’) installation of Ubuntu on the Mac is 
similar to how it was done in the VM. The preparatory steps 
are what you need to be careful about. I will show you how to 
prepare your Mac to install Ubuntu (and will omit most of the 
installation process, since it's the same as above).

summary—for the VM—hit Create here as well. That 
completes the VM creation. Now set the VM to boot from 
the Ubuntu ISO file to start installation.
In the VirtualBox main screen, select the just-created VM 
and click Settings on the main toolbar. Click the Storage tab 
and select the optical disk icon under IDE Controller (see 
Figure 1). On the right-hand side, click the CD icon beside 
CD/DVD Drive: IDE Secondary and click Choose a virtual 
CD/DVD disk file...; select the downloaded Ubuntu ISO file 
and click OK in the Settings box.
With the preparation done, let’s start installation. 
With the new VM selected, hit Start in the main toolbar. 
VirtualBox fires up the VM and boots the ISO file. The 
Ubuntu splash comes up; wait till it loads the installer 
screen. On the installer Welcome screen, choose Install 
Ubuntu. On the checklist screen, click Continue after 
checking Install this third-party software for MP3 codecs.

The author is a new media designer, with an affinity for physical 
computing, computer software and code, as well as country music.
First, resize your existing Mac OS partition. Open up Disk 
Utility (Spotlight > “Disk Utility”). Select the hard disk and 
hit the Partition tab. Notice the drag handle in the bottom-right 
of the Mac partition? Use it to click-drag-resize the partition, 
or select the partition and edit the value in the text-box. Either 
way, create about 8-10 GB of free space, and click Apply. Disk 
Utility will do its work and resize the Mac system partition.
Enter rEFIt. A little background information is due here. 
Unlike PCs, recent-generation Macs have something called 
EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface), instead of the familiar 
BIOS. Put simply, it’s a cooler successor to the BIOS. In fact, 
Windows 8, coming out in October this year, implements 
this natively. Coming back to your experiment—since you 
can’t boot EFI systems like BIOS ones, you need a little piece 
of software that sits on top of the EFI system in your Mac. 
This tool is called rEFIt, an open source EFI bootloader and 
maintenance toolkit. Download the DMG from the link (given 
at the end of the article) and install it by the usual Mount > 
MPKG Install process. Ideally, the boot menu should appear 
on restart, but in many cases it takes two reboots for the menu 
(Figure 4) to show. 
Once rEFIt is in place, proceed to prepare the boot media. 
There are two options here—burn a CD, or prep a USB flash 
drive. The former is super easy, and works without a hitch. 
The latter, on the other hand, is quite a process— it may not 
work smoothly. I had to retry a few times before I succeeded. 
Nonetheless, I will outline the procedure below.
Plug in your USB flash drive and open up the Terminal 
(Spotlight > “Terminal”). Run the following command, 
replacing the path to the downloaded Ubuntu ISO file:
hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ubuntu-mac-boot Downloads/
ubuntu*.iso
The above command will convert the ISO into a DMG file. 
This is required so that you can then write this Mac-compatible 
image directly to the USB flash drive’s partition. Before you write 
it, unmount (NOT eject) the flash drive. Run diskutil list; this will 
list all disks and partitions. Note down the partition number (in the 
format ‘diskX’) of the USB drive. With that number, run:
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX
Now, it's time to write the image you created onto the 
flash drive:
sudo dd if=ubuntu-mac-boot.dmg of=/dev/diskX bs=1m
Once the process completes, eject the drive as follows:
diskutil eject /dev/diskX
Now, restart the Mac and choose the USB drive from the 
rEFIt menu. This starts the installer. In case you have burnt 
the CD, pop it in, reboot the Mac and hold down ‘C’ to boot 
from it; this too, will start the installer.
Once the installer starts up, a couple of things need to be 
done differently from the previous (VM) install process:
(a)	  Select Something Else on the Installation Type screen; 
then select the free (UNPARTITIONED) space you created 
using Disk Utility (I used the 10 GB free space I created 
for this experiment) and create the following partitions: 

/ for root (about 8 GB)

/boot (about 500 MB) 

swap (1500 MB) 
(b) 	On the partition screen, select the GRUB (bootloader) 
destination as the /boot partition, and NOT the MBR. 
This is important, else your Mac would be rendered 
unbootable, and you would have to do a rescue from your 
Mac OS X Install DVD.
The rest of the steps would be the same as the VM install 
described earlier. That should do it!
So enjoy your time with the Penguin on the Apple (I like 
that phrase!) and so long, until next time!

X
code was first seen in 2003; the latest stable release is 
v4.4, which is available free for Mac OS X Lion and 
OS X Mountain Lion in the Mac App Store. Xcode 
includes a modified version of the GNU Compiler Collection. 
Apple recently introduced the Command-Line Tools (CLT) as 
open source; these include the Apple LLVM compiler, linker 
and Make. The CLT can be used with or without Xcode. Along 
with these, Xcode also supports dozens of other programming 
languages, which include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, 
AppleScript, Java, Python, Ruby, Ada, Cocoa and Carbon. 
Apple claims to be the first major computer company to make 
open source a key part of its software strategy, and so has 
continued to use and release open source software.
Command line tools
Let’s take a look at the major CLT utilities.
LLVM compiler
LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) is a huge collection 
of tools and libraries that make it easy to build new 
compilers, and compile-time, link-time, run-time and ‘idle-
time’ optimisers; Just-In-Time compilers (similar to Java); 
and a large, powerful and distinctive variety of compiler 
category programs. Some key features of the LLVM 
compiler include an extremely simple design, source-
language independence, automated compiler debugging 
support, extensibility, stability and reliability. Apart from 
this, LLVM is also capable of generating relocatable 
machine code at any time of the program’s life cycle. 
Initially written to replace the existing code generator 
in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) stack, it now 
supports various programming languages, including Ada, 
C, C++, Fortran, the use of many front-ends—and has had 
many GCC front-ends modified to work with it.
Linkers
A linker combines libraries and compiler-generated objects 
into an executable program. On UNIX-like systems, we 
use the term loader in place of linker. The linker is capable 
of including only the required objects from the library 
collection, when the library has diverse purposes. Hence, the 
linker plays a vital role in the CLT.
Mac users may know of Xcode, the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) by Apple, 
which is used to develop software for OS X and iOS. One of its main components is 
Command-Line Tools, which this article covers.

Make
Make is a build automation tool. It builds executable 
programs and libraries from source code by following 
instructions in Makefiles to derive the target program. As 
IDEs and language-specific compilers find prominent use 
on Windows and other platforms, make is widely used 
on UNIX (-like) systems. Make also decides whether the 
target needs to be regenerated or not, by comparing file 
modification times and thus avoiding rebuilding files that 
are already up-to-date.
Git
Initially designed by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel 
source, Git is a distributed revision control and source-code 
management system with an emphasis on speed. Each Git 
working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete 
revision-tracking capabilities, which does not need network 
access or a central server for history and other functions. 
Git’s main features include distributed development, 
compatibility with existing systems and protocols, efficient 
handling of large products, a tool-kit based design, and 
periodic explicit object packing.
Installation
Now let’s move on to installation.
Xcode on Lion and Mountain Lion
Visit https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ and go to ‘View in 
Mac App Store’. This will automatically redirect you to the 
Xcode page of the App Store on your Mac. Just click Free, 
then Install App. 
Xcode on Snow Leopard
On Leopard, it’s preferable to install Xcode 4.2. Go to http://
developer.apple.com/downloads/ and sign in with your Apple 
ID. If you’re not registered yet, do it now. Search for Xcode 
4.2, click ‘Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard’ and then click on the 
.dmg link to download it. Once the download is finished, it 
will automatically launch a window in your Finder, as shown 
in Figure 1. Double-click the Xcode package installer to 
launch it. See that all checkboxes are selected. Wait till the 
installation completes.
Installing CLT
Once the Xcode installation is complete, you can install any 
further components from Xcode. Launching Xcode from 
the Applications folder and from the menu bar go to Xcode 
> Preferences. Click the Install button for ‘Command Line 
Tools’ to install it (see Figure 2).
Installing Git
Installing Git is simple; visit http://git-scm.com/downloads/; 
click ‘Mac OS X’, and your .dmg is downloaded. From your 
Finder, launch it to install Git on your system. After you’ve 
installed Git, configure it! Launch the Git Bash shell and run 
the following commands:
$ git config --global user.name “your name”
$ git config --global user.email “youremail@email.com”
These commands set the name and email address for Git 
to use when you commit. Git commit is a utility which helps 
record a snapshot of staging content.
Usage
The CLT can be used from Xcode, and also independently 
from the terminal. For usage and parameters, please do 
check the documentation for these tools, which is available 
online. Happy developing!

characteristics relative to some traditional aspects of 
enterprise IT. But at the same time, most organisations 
are still apprehensive about moving all their applications 
onto public cloud providers. Whatever the reasons for that 
may be, there is nevertheless also considerable interest 
in the idea of building hybrid clouds spanning both on-
premise and off-premise resources to deliver the best of 
both worlds: public cloud economics and agility optimised 
for enterprise needs such as audit, risk management, and 
strong policy management.
Careful evaluation needs to be part of the decision-
making process when adopting a private, hybrid, or 
publicly hosted cloud model. Large enterprises and 
government IT departments have long utilised costly, 
proprietary systems as their core IT systems. Often, an 
important step on the journey to cloud computing will 
be to standardise legacy systems, as appropriate, onto 
modern, standards-based hardware and software. Without 
taking an inventory of and developing a plan for their 
existing IT infrastructure and applications, organisations 
put themselves at a disadvantage of not being able to 
fully realise the financial and technical benefits of cloud 
computing. For example, adopting an open architected and 
standards-based operating system such as Linux, which is 
built on the principles of community-powered innovation, 
provides many benefits. These enterprise-class open 
source offerings can provide a solid foundation for next-
generation IT infrastructure and offer world-class support 
so organisations can achieve better business performance 
and greater cost efficiencies. 
An open, hybrid cloud management approach allows 
organisations to evolve to pursue this sort of standardisation 
at their own pace. It offers an alternative to replacing all 
their existing applications and infrastructure, and starting 
anew—a tempting approach to simplification but one that’s 
not practical for most. It also offers a better way than simply 
extending an existing set of proprietary technologies and 
products, such as a virtualisation platform, onto the cloud. 
Doing so can simply transfer an organisation from one form 
of vendor lock-in to another, trading proprietary virtualisation 
for the proprietary cloud.
By: Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen
The author is vice president and general manager, Asia Pacific 
and Japan, Red Hat.
Openness provides a path in this evolutionary approach 
that puts organisations in control of their technology 
roadmap and the future of their IT resources. We see open 
source as part of the equation. 
         Open source vendors contribute source code to 
projects and let all users contribute to make it better. 
The widespread support of KVM (Kernel-based Virtual 
Machine) and the Open Virtualization Alliance (OVA) 
by organisations that typically compete, including IBM, 
HP, Dell, AMD, Intel and Fujitsu, is a testament to their 
interest in an open approach for hypervisors. The oVirt 
project adds open source virtualisation management
Hybrid cloud management, which allows 
organisations to build a cloud out of multiple 
virtualisation platforms as well as public clouds, can 
fundamentally benefit from open source and other aspects 
of openness such as open standards and open application 
programming interfaces (APIs). A good example is the 
Deltacloud project, which is governed by the Apache 
Software Foundation. It offers a transparent, ‘no lock-in’ 
approach to cloud-building by providing a set of APIs 
that can talk to a heterogeneous set of ‘cloud providers’, 
including virtualisation stacks and public clouds. Any 
decision to move to the cloud needs to take into account 
the ease of management in a cloud and across different 
clouds, as well as the ability to change cloud providers if 
and when an organisation chooses to do so.
Cloud computing has certainly reached a level of 
market maturity and we are well on our way to a stage 
where it will become the accepted norm. In the meantime, 
for many, the cloud is still a thrilling new technology 
alternative that holds immense promise but should be 
approached with the same deliberation and thought as with 
any other strategic IT product. And make no mistake about 
it—cloud computing is, or should be, strategic for your 
organisation.

Y
ou probably have encountered one of the following 
situations:

You want to troubleshoot problems on, or install an 
application or the LAMP stack on a friend's computer, but 
can't visit his place.

You want to run an application on your friend's computer 
and view it on your own computer. For example, suppose 
LibreOffice is not installed on your computer, but is on 
your friend's; so can you use the copy on your friend's 
computer from your own system?

You want to copy a file from your friend's computer to 
your own system, or vice versa.
Linux users will be happy to know you can do these, and 
a lot more, for free. Let’s discuss a very useful remote access 
tool, SSH (Secure Shell).
The word ‘secure’ is important here; there are many 
tools, like telnet, for remote access—but not all are secure. 
The data transmitted on the network could be intercepted 
by other users on the same network (called data sniffing). 
SSH, though, is reliable, convenient, efficient, user-
friendly, and most importantly, secured. The SSH client 
connects to, and facilitates logging in to the remote host 
(computer). You provide credentials to the remote machine 
as specified in the server's sshd_config file in its /etc/ssh 
directory. When that's verified and accepted by the server, 
it will execute the command you sent, or log you into a 
normal command shell on the remote machine. So, the 
preconditions for using SSH are:

Both computers must have SSH installed (the server on 
one and the client on the other). Generally, the SSH client 
is already installed on Linux computers.

Both computers must be connected through a network.

You must have an account (a user ID and password) on 
the remote host, to log in with.
Basic use
Let us consider a scenario of (only) two computers on a 
LAN or local network. One, which acts as the server, at the 
IP address 192.168.1.100, runs CentOS 5.5; the other, my 
‘local’ client computer, is a laptop running Fedora 14, at 
IP address 192.168.1.101. I have a user account ‘binay’ on 
the remote computer. To log in to the remote server, I run 
ssh binay@192.168.1.100. Here, the user name ‘binay’ is 
followed by @ and the IP address (or the host-name or fully 
qualified domain name) of the remote host. The remote server 
asks for the password; supply the right one, and you are 
logged in. You could run a simple command like ls to list the 
files in binay' s  home directory on the remote host.
Now let's move on to copying files between the remote 
server and the local computer, and vice-versa. Suppose I want 
to copy the file riya.odt from the remote host to my local 
machine, I just run the following command:
scp 192.168.1.100:/home/binay/riya.odt /home/local/
To copy a file from the local computer to the remote 
host, you switch the IP address (of the remote server) to the 
destination and adjust the target path. For more information, 
see http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/xfer/scp.html and http://
www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php.
You can also execute commands on the remote computer. 
For example, let’s suppose you want to check the remote

system's messages file. To access it, you must log in as the 
root, so the command to use is as shown below:
ssh root@192.168.1.100 “tail -f /var/log/messages”
Now what’ been done so far is text-UI-based; can we use 
the GUI over SSH? Yes, by using a technique called X11 
session forwarding.
X11 session forwarding
This is designed to transmit window and bitmap information 
over the network, and lets you log in to a remote machine 
and run an XWindow application (like GIMP, OpenOffice, 
games, etc). While the application runs on the remote 
computer, the GUI will be displayed on your local computer. 
The -X -f switches to SSH enable this; you run something like 
ssh -X -f username@host application_name to accomplish 
this. XClock is a good application to test this; run ssh -X 
-f binay@192.168.1.100 xclock and enter the password. 
You should then see the clock window on your screen, as 
seen in the Figure. If this does not work, please check in /
etc/ssh/sshd whether X11 forwarding has been set to ‘Yes’. 
After verifying that X11 forwarding works, you can run any 
GUI application remotely—for example, the Nautilus file 
manager, or even a game like Mahjong. You can even run 
a whole desktop environment (DE) on the remote machine, 
viewed on your local machine, with a command like ssh -X 
-f binay@192.168.1.100 gnome-session. You should see the 
GNOME panel appear on your local display.
Finally, you can end your SSH session by pressing Ctrl-D.
This is just a brief introduction to SSH. It is not 
limited to LAN use only; you can use SSH to connect 
to computers across the globe. There is more interesting 
information on SSH tunnelling and port forwarding, 
which I will cover in an upcoming issue.

verything seems fine when your Linux machine 
works just the way you want it to. But that feeling 
changes dramatically when your machine starts 
creating problems that you find really difficult to sort out. 
Not everyone can troubleshoot a Linux machine efficiently… 
but you can, if you are ready to stay with us for the next 
few minutes. Let’s look at what to do when some of your 
important system files are deleted or corrupted under Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux 5. The action begins now!
Scene 1: /etc/passwd is deleted 
This is an important file in Linux as it contains information 
about user accounts and passwords. If it’s missing in your 
system and you try to log in to a user account, you get an 
error message stating ‘Log-in incorrect’ and after restarting 
the system, you will see the screen shot shown in Figure 1.
Now that you have seen the problem and its consequences, 
it’s time to solve it. Boot into single user mode. At the start of 
booting, press any key to enter into the GRUB menu. Here you 
will see a list of the operating systems installed. Just select the 
one you are working with and press ‘e’.
It’s time to have some fun with kernel parameters. So 
highlight the kernel and again press ‘e’ to edit its parameters.
Next, instruct the kernel to boot into single user mode, 
which is also known as maintenance mode. Just type ‘1’ after 
a space and press the Enter key. Now press ‘b’ to continue the 
booting process.
Now that you have booted into single user mode, you are 
probably asking yourself, “What is next?”. The tricky portion 
of this exercise is now over and it takes just one command to 
have your passwd file in its place. Actually, there is a file /etc/
passwd-, which is nothing but the backup file for /etc/passwd. 
So all you need to do is to issue the following command:
cp /etc/passwd- /etc/passwd 
…and you are done. Now you can issue the init 5 
command to switch to the graphical mode. Everything is fine 
now. You can also find the backup of /etc/shadow and /etc/
gshadow as /etc/shadow- and /etc/gshadow- respectively.
Scene 2: /etc/pam.d/login is deleted
If your /etc/pam.d/login file is deleted and you try to log in, 
it won’t ask you to enter your password after entering your 
username. Instead, it will continuously show the localhost 
login prompt. Here again, there is a single command that will 
solve the problem for you:
 cp /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/login
 
Just boot into the single user mode as done earlier, type 
this command and you’ll be able to log in normally. There is 
also a second solution to this problem, which we’ll look at 
after a while.

Here are some valuable tips to help you find important system files in RHEL 5, 
which get deleted by accident.

Troubleshooting

Figure 1: Error message after passwd file is deleted
Figure 2: GRUB menu
Figure 3: Edit kernel parameters
Figure 4: Enter into single user mode
Scene 3: /etc/inittab is deleted
We know that in Linux, init is the first process to be started 
and it starts all the other processes. The /etc/inittab file 
contains instructions for the init process and if it’s missing, 
then no further process can be launched. On starting a system 
with no inittab file, it will show the following message:
‘INIT:No inittab file found’
…and will ask you to enter a runlevel. When you do that, 
it again shows the message that no more processes are left in 
this runlevel.
Fixing this problem is not easy because being in the 
single user mode doesn’t help in this case. Here, you need 
the Linux rescue environment to fix this problem. So set 
your first boot device to CD and boot with the RHEL5 
CD. At the boot prompt, type ‘Linux rescue’ to enter the 
rescue environment.
Once you have entered into the rescue environment, your 
system will be mounted under /mnt/sysimage. Here, reinstall 
the package that provides the /etc/inittab file. The overall 
process is given below:
chroot /mnt/sysimage
rpm -q --whatprovides /etc/inittab
mkdir /a
mount /dev/hdc /a
Here /dev/hdc is the path of the CD. It may vary on your 
system, though.
rpm –Uvh --force /a/Server/initscripts-8.45.25-1.el5.i386.rpm 
You can also hit the Tab key after init to auto complete 
the name.
Now you’ll get your /etc/inittab file back. The same 
procedure can be applied to recover the /etc/pam.d/login 
file. In this case, you’ll have to install the util-linux 
package. Once you are done with it, type Exit to leave the 
rescue environment, set your first boot device to hard disk 
and boot normally.
Scene 4: /boot/grub/grub.conf is deleted
This file is the configuration file of the GRUB boot 
loader. If it is deleted and you start your machine, you 
will see a GRUB prompt that indicates that grub.conf is 
missing and there is no further instruction for GRUB to 
carry on its operation.

wordpress.com, where he regularly writes about various topics 
related to Linux, security and the Internet. To know about his poetic 
side, take a look at http://www.maishayartonhi.wordpress.com, 
which is another blog of his.
But don’t worry, as we’ll solve this problem, too, in 
the next few minutes. You don’t even need to enter single 
user mode or the Linux rescue environment for this. At 
the GRUB prompt, you can enter some command that can 
make your system boot. So here we go: Type root (and hit 
Tab to find out the hard disks attached to the system. In 
my case, I got hd0 and fd0—the hard disk and floppy disk, 
respectively). Now we know that GRUB is stored in the 
first sector of a hard disk, which is hd0,0. So the complete 
command would be root (hd0,0). Enter this command and 
press the Enter key to carry on.
You now need to find out the kernel image file. So enter 
kernel /v and hit Tab to auto complete it. In my system, it’s 
vmlinuz-2.6.18-128.el5. Please note it down as we’ll require 
this information further, and then press Enter.
Figure 5: inittab file is deleted
Figure 6: Linux rescue mode
Figure 7: Install the initscripts package
Figure 8: The GRUB prompt
Figure 9: Booting through the GRUB prompt
Next, let’s figure out the initrd image file. So enter 
initrd /i and press Tab to auto complete it. For me, it’s 
initrd-2.6.18-128.el5.img. Again note it down and press Enter.
Type boot and press Enter, and the system will boot 
normally. 
Now it’s time to create a grub.conf file manually. So 
create the /boot/grub/grub.conf file and enter the following 
data in it:
splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
default=0
timeout=5
title Red Hat
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-128.el5
initrd /initrd-26.18-128.el5.img
Save the file and quit it. You have created a grub.conf 
file manually to resolve the problem. Don’t forget that the 
kernel and the initrd image file name may vary on your 
system. That’s why I asked you to note them down earlier. 
You can also find them in the /boot folder once you are 
logged in—it’s not a big issue.
So we have looked at solutions to four different 
problems. I hope this information  assists you in learning 
Linux troubleshooting. Carry on this work and acquire 
more troubleshooting skills because that’s what makes you 
a true Linux geek.

efore we talk about wireless security and vulnerability 
attacks, we must understand the basic radio 
transmissions, and the IEEE 802.11 protocol, also 
commonly known as the WLAN protocol. This protocol 
links two or more devices over a short distance, using spread 
spectrum signals. Spread spectrum, at its core, is based on radio 
communication frequencies to establish point-to-point wireless 
communication between a transmitter and a receiver, while 
achieving resistance to signal jamming and signal fading. As 
shown in Figure 1, to establish a wireless network, you need a 
wireless access point (AP) and also a wireless adaptor for each 
node to be connected. The AP is also called a hot-spot; it hosts 
a radio transceiver similar to a walkie-talkie. It also contains 
hardware to convert digital data into radio signals and vice-versa.
The AP has a unique feature called a beacon transmission, 
whereby it keeps transmitting a digitised signal, typically, 
a few times every second. This signal contains the network 
identification data, the service set identifier (SSID) and some 
trivial error-correction information. Nodes such as laptops or 
other wireless devices detect this signal in order to show it in 
the list of available wireless networks. It also detects whether 
or not the AP is using any security, the level of the security 
protocol, etc. 
The AP contains a TCP/IP stack, which responds to ARP 
requests when a node tries to connect to it. Since wireless 
Wireless networks are everywhere, 
from the home to corporate data 
centres. They make our lives easier 
by avoiding bulky cables and related 
problems. But with these benefits 
comes a threat: wireless networks 
are prone to attacks. This article 
discusses techniques to protect 
FOSS networks, which systems 
administrators can implement to 
achieve adequate security.
Cyber Attacks Explained
Wireless Attacks
networks can allow multiple nodes, it is essential to have an 
authentication layer prior to letting data transfer take place. It 
is the AP’s responsibility to ensure this security, as well as to 
monitor packet transmission and data integrity.
Wi-Fi security
Since wireless networks don’t have built-in security 
mechanisms, a secure layer on top of the wireless protocol 
stack is achieved by encryption and authentication techniques 
such as WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) or WPA (Wi-Fi 
Protected Access). This is especially important because, 
unlike a wired network, wireless signals can be easily 
intercepted using a signal-trapping device. Let’s discuss how 
these encryption techniques work, in detail. 
To establish a secure channel, the client first sends an 
authentication request to the AP, and receives a challenge 
from it in text form. The client encrypts this text using the 
preconfigured key and sends it back. The AP decrypts it, 
and when it succeeds, replies to the client. If the keys don’t 
match, the request is dropped, and the client cannot connect 
to the AP. This method is called pre-shared authentication. 
In an improved version, the shared key is combined with the 
SSID of the wireless AP, to further toughen the encryption 
key logic. WEP encryption uses the RC4 algorithm on 
all packets that travel between the AP and the node.

information. By extending this technique, the attacker can 
now plant a denial of service attack on a particular node in 
order to disrupt its services. Typically, a SYN flood method 
is used, because it is sufficient to generate a packet storm 
on the given wireless connection bandwidth.
MITM attacks: We did explore man in the middle 
(MITM) attacks in one of the previous articles and most of 
that applies to wireless networks as well. The only technical 
difference here is that the attacker gains information of 
an actively used SSID of an AP, instead of an on-the-wire 
session. As shown in Figure 2, a dummy AP with exactly the 
same name is created by the attacker, and the signal power 
is raised to such an extent that the nodes are fooled into 
believing that it is the AP they should connect to. This creates 
an MITM situation. These dummy APs, also called rogue 
points, are usually set up close to the nodes to be hacked.
Signal-jamming attacks: Unlike the above techniques, 
this method uses wireless radio transmission techniques to 
create an attack. In this type, the attacker uses a powerful 
antenna and a signal generator, and creates frequency patterns 
in the same range as wireless signals. The frequency patterns 
are modulated with powerful radio frequency ripples, to create 
a wireless signal storm. This results in the jamming of the APs 
as well as the nodes, thus disabling their connectivity. While 
such an attack was just a theory previously, with a growing 
number of wireless networks these attacks have now occurred 
more often than earlier.
Besides these, there are a few other types of attacks, 
some of which make use of one or more of the attacks 
mentioned above.
802.11 injection attacks: Modern attackers tend to go 
deep into the protocol stack in order to plant an attack. For 
wireless networks, an attacker can first perform a passive 
attack to understand the protocol frame structure, and then 
create 802.11 protocol datagram frames and insert those 
into the network. This is usually done either to create a false 
packet stream as a hindrance for a wireless network, or to sniff 
the network further in an active mode. The response 802.11 
frames are then captured again, interpreted and modified to 
perform an MITM attack. Since this attack happens at Layer 
2, it is very tough to detect.
Wireless packet injection: Here, passive attacks are used 
to capture traffic, which is then analysed. However, there 
can be situations in which there won’t be enough traffic to 
generate sufficient data, which can lead to time-consuming 
or futile hacking efforts. Hence, attackers use wireless packet 
injection techniques whereby, besides the 802.11 frames, 
IP datagrams are sent to the target AP. Though the AP will 
drop such packets as unauthorised, this gives the attacker 
the necessary amount of traffic, which is captured and fed 
into key-cracking utilities. Since the attacker controls the 
packet-generator utility, specific data patterns are intentionally 
created to map the AP’s behaviour in terms of response 
packets, which further helps in reducing the cracking time.
Unfortunately, these security mechanisms are either flawed 
by design, or are not adequate for IT infrastructures where 
data carried on wireless channels is sensitive. 
With this basic understanding of Wi-Fi security, let us 
now discuss a few security attacks. In general, there are four 
categories of possible attacks.
Passive attacks: In this type, the attacker listens or 
eavesdrops on an open wireless channel by using a wireless 
modem rigged to work in a promiscuous mode. All traffic 
packets that contain important information, such as MAC 
addresses, packet sequences, etc, are stored. Passive attacks 
may not necessarily be malicious in nature, but help provide 
information for active attacks. Since passive attacks take 
place silently, they are almost impossible to detect and stop. 
Attackers using passive methods usually capture and store 
data, and use a packet-deciphering tool to decrypt it and 
steal information. This is especially true in case of the WEP 
protocol, due to its inherent lack of security. Passive attacks 
are also called wireless war-driving.
Active attacks: Once an attacker gets sufficient 
information by passive attacks, an active attack can be 
tried. Common examples are denial of service, IP spoofing, 
etc. In case of spoofing, the attacker gains access to 
an unauthorised wireless station, and performs packet 
crafting to impersonate a valid and authorised station. 
Wireless nodes are incapable of detecting this, and end 
up connecting to the attacker’s station and revealing

PSK guessing: As we learnt earlier, a pre-shared 
key is used between the wireless AP and node to encrypt 
communication. Typically, administrators setting up Wi-Fi 
networks tend to leave the vendor-provided default key 
in place. Smart attackers usually first try to detect the 
manufacturer of wireless APs, and if that information is not 
available, they try to guess it and attempt to break the key.
Key cracking: Usually a pre-shared key should be 
enough to establish security. However, in case of WEP-
based Wi-Fi networks, attackers can use passive methods to 
sniff and capture a lot of data, and subject it to key-cracking 
algorithms. As we saw earlier, WEP is a simple RC4 XOR 
type of encryption, and it only takes some amount of time 
to break into it. It had been demonstrated by attackers that a 
packet capture of more than 40000 can be sufficient data to 
crack a WEP key in minutes. With the introduction of WPA 
security features in a wireless AP, it became tough to break 
the key. However other brute-force attacks, such as statistical 
key guessing, dictionary attacks, etc, can be used to crack it.
Wireless attack detection
Before we talk about protecting the infrastructure, it is 
imperative to understand a few detection techniques. 
Unlike wired networks, a wireless network signal can be 
compromised easily, which makes detection difficult but 
certainly not impossible.
AP monitoring: As we learnt, securing the SSID 
of an AP or wireless router is very important. In a large 
organisation, keeping track of SSIDs can be a challenge; 
hence, this information should be programmatically stored in 
a secure database. Other crucial details, such as the MAC ID, 
IP restrictions, the wireless channel used, the beacon settings, 
wireless signal strength and bandwidth type are stored for 
each corresponding SSID. A wireless monitoring device, 
or a mobile device running monitoring software, is used to 
detect all stations and APs periodically, and the results are 
compared with the baseline database created earlier. Such 
routine audits ensure the integrity of router settings and thus 
the overall wireless network security.
Wi-Fi node monitoring: Along with the APs, each node 
needs to be monitored too. The technique is a bit different, 
though. For the nodes, a MAC-based security on the APs 
can be configured, whereby a particular AP would support 
only a set of MAC addresses. This ensures that the wireless 
client node cannot roam around beyond the configured zone, 
and if such a need arises the request can be fulfilled via an 
authorisation and approval process. For large organisations, 
this can result in systems administration overhead, in 
which case the nodes can be allowed to connect to all APs; 
however, each connection and disconnection can be logged 
and parsed for anomalous behaviour.
Traffic monitoring: Besides the above techniques, 
network administrators can periodically take samples of 
data from each AP, and check for denial of service and SYN 
flood attacks. Multiple connections and disconnections on 
a particular AP from one or more client nodes should also 
trigger a warning. As for Layer 2 attacks, a signal spectrum 
detection tool can be incorporated too, to detect signal-
jamming situations.
Protecting FOSS systems
Along with the monitoring techniques, additional security 
measures are essential. For small networks, changing the 
default password and SSID of the AP is a must. Modern 
routers are equipped with a feature to disable the broadcasting 
of SSID, which should be turned on to ensure that passive 
sniffing attacks are thwarted to some extent. Periodically 
changing SSIDs is highly recommended, though it can be 
a tough task for a large number of wireless APs. To protect 
a Linux server farm hosted in a data-centre, the wireless 
signal strength of APs should be adjusted in such a way that 
it should be adequate for client nodes to connect and transfer 
data seamlessly, but at the same time it should not cross 
physical building boundaries, whereby it can be detected by a 
‘drive-by’ attacker.
Using WPA2 security instead of WEP is recommended. 
Besides, the shared key of WPA security should be long and 
complex enough to stop directory brute-force attacks. For 
large corporations, the Layer-7 wireless security software 
should be installed on client nodes as well as APs, to further 
strengthen the encryption process. For FOSS systems, 
using an X.509 certificate on either end of the wireless 
communication can help achieve cheaper yet effective 
security. Most famous flavours, such as Debian and Ubuntu, 
support WPA2 security with trimmings such as AES, TKIP 
and LEAP. Configuring those, along with MAC address 
filtering, and enabling firewall features can protect a serious 
server farm, yet let it enjoy the benefits of wireless networks.
Wireless attacks are, unfortunately, easy to carry out and 
difficult to detect. Modern data centres allow the presence of 
wireless networks connected to the product server farms, thus 
requiring the implementation of security measures. While 
there is no single solution to protect wireless networks, an 
appropriate combination of the techniques mentioned above 
can achieve adequate security. Wireless monitoring audits 
are an important activity that needs to be done by network 
administrators at regular intervals.

For U & Me
Interview
“Open source professionals are at an advantage when it comes to hiring, simply because the demand
for such skills is much higher than the supply,” says Karthi Swaminathan, vice president, Site
Operations and Engineering, CollabNet, in an exclusive conversation with Diksha P Gupta from LFY.
I
f you are a professional with exposure to open source 
technologies, you are at an advantage. Sounds incredible? 
Well, you have to believe it because 
companies like CollabNet are constantly looking 
for people with experience in open source 
technology. Explaining the advantage of open 
source skill sets, Karthi Swaminathan, vice 
president, Site Operations and Engineering, 
CollabNet, said, “I think people with exposure in 
open source technology have better engineering 
expertise. Being a part of an open source project 
adds value to their resume. They surely stand a 
better chance in getting selected over the others 
in a company like ours where open source 
technology is a major part of our business.”
CollabNet is one of the early adopters of open 
source technology. The company has sponsored the Subversion 
project, which is a very popular version control system used by 
millions of developers across the globe. Swaminathan said, “As 
consumers, we use a lot of open source technologies, be it Red 
Hat, JBoss or MySQL for our own product development, and 
they are part of what we build for customers as solutions.
Good open source professionals are hard to find
CollabNet is one of the many companies that hires professionals 
with experience in open source technology, year after year, 
but has found it a difficult task. Swaminathan said, “Few years 
back there was a severe dearth of open source professionals 
in India. I would say it was just one in every ten candidates 
we interviewed that we could hire. The number of people 
contributing to the open source community was very low. There 
were a lot of people who had tried or experienced open source as 
consumers but very few who actually contributed to open source 
technologies.” This was one of the major hurdle for companies 
that wanted to try projects using open source technologies.
At CollabNet, open source professionals are preferred 
over the others. Swaminathan adds, “If we have to hire for 
the engineering teams, we look for open source exposure in 
every hire. We are always glad to hire such professionals. I 
cannot quote the exact figures but I can confidently say that 
professionals with experience in open source technology are 
preferred over the others. If there are some very talented people 
without experience in open source technology, we  encourage 
them to get friendly with the technology when they come on 
board. We ensure that they get opportunities so that they can 
grow in this direction.” But the market remains the 
driver in this case as well. Enterprises are adopting 
open source technology in a big way and hence 
there is a demand for open source professionals 
as well. “Some of the open source solutions fit the 
bill pretty well for many companies. Open source, 
by its very nature, attracts some of the best talent 
across the industry to contribute. So, basically, a 
mature open source product is a good option in 
terms of the issues it addresses and its technical 
soundness,” adds Swaminathan. 
The scene is changing...
 The consumers of open source technology are 
increasing but the number of developers is not growing at 
the same rate. Swaminathan explains, “The situation is much 
better than what it used to be five to six years back. If we look 
at the situation then, the talent available to contribute to open 
source was minimal and we were one of the pioneers in that 
space. But of late, things have changed.   We are starting to 
see people contributing to  various open source projects – and 
whether they do it as a part of their jobs or due to their own 
interest is immaterial.
There are people who have completely adopted open source 
as their career option, irrespective of their remuneration. They 
just want to contribute to open source society. People now 
know that by working on open source, they are working with 
the best minds across the industry. It gets them a lot of visibility 
and marketability.” Open source technology is becoming 
increasingly mainstream. A lot of great products have come out 
of the open source world and that clearly has attracted a lot of 
great talent. That, too, is contributing to the improving trend. 
Open source is contagious 
If you have an interest in open source technology, CollabNet 
provides you a perfect atmosphere to grow and live your passion. 
Swaminathan says, “We have renowned open source contributors 
working within the company.  We also provide platform and 
programs for those engineers who are interested in learning and 
contributing to open source technologies, and a good number of open 
source committers have emerged that way, already. ” 
“There was a severe dearth of  
open source professionals in India… 
but things are changing now''

B
efore we jump to the main part of the article, let’s 
take a quick look at filters. In computing, filters 
are nothing but simple programs, which take the 
input image, operate on it and give an output image. The 
image is convolved with another signal. For images, we 
use 2D convolution to apply the filters. The concept of 2D 
convolution is explained below.
To the computer, an image is a simple two-dimensional 
matrix. For example, a 640x480 gray scale image is a 2D 
matrix with 640 rows and 480 columns. The filter to be 
applied is also a small two-dimensional filter. The small 
matrix is ‘run’ over the input image. This means that the 
small matrix is centred at every pixel in the image, and the 
corresponding elements are multiplied and summed up to give 
the new pixel value.
Edge-detection algorithms
Implementation of edge detection is done using filters. To put 
it simply, edge detection is applying a high-pass filter to the 
image. A few edge-detection algorithms are listed below.
Laplace: Differentiation, as we know, is a high-pass filter. 
The laplace operator gives the second-order two-dimensional 
differentiation of the image. The drawback is that the output 
edge map is not single-pixel thick. The convolution matrix for 
the laplace operator is:
0
-1
0
-1
4
-1
0

0
Prewitt: This edge detection is a composition of two 
edge maps. One is the original image differentiated along the 
horizontal axis, and the other differentiated along the vertical 
axis. Adding these two as two perpendicular vectors will give 
the final edge map. The two differentiation matrices are:

Overview
Edges characterise boundaries and are therefore a problem of fundamental 
importance in image processing. Edge detection helps suppress data, while at the 
same time maintaining the structure of the image. It is also helpful in image-processing 
routines like pattern recognition, pattern matches, etc. This article briefly discusses 
canny edge detection and its implementation in Python using SciPy.

Sobel: This is similar to Prewitt, but the differentiation 
matrices are different.
Canny: Canny edge detection is an optimal edge-detection 
algorithm. It uses multiple steps to achieve high precision.
Canny edge detection
Canny edge detection is a four-step process.
1.   Initially, a Gaussian blur is applied to clear any speckles 
and free the image of noise. This step is optional. 
However, if the image has too much noise, or if you want 
Figure 1:Raw image
Figure 2: First image
Figure 3: Angle map
to detect fewer edges, a Gaussian blur is mandatory.
2.   A Sobel or Prewitt operator is applied to get two edge 
maps—the horizontal edge map gradx and the vertical 
edge map grady. The edge map is a combination of these 
two edge maps. Also, the direction of the gradient at 
each point, i.e., the angle, is calculated as follows:
theta = arctan ( grady / gradx )
To detect only the major edges, all edges below a certain 
threshold will be removed. For example, all pixels whose 
value is less than 10 will be made zero, indicating that it is 
not a pixel on any edge.
3.   A non-maximum suppression algorithm is 
now applied. For a given pixel, there are eight 
neighbouring pixels. Hence, there are four possible 
directions: 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees and 
135 degrees. The angles are quantised into these four 
angles. Now consider a pixel in the image. Let us 
assume that the angle of gradient at that point is 0 
degrees. This implies that the direction of the edge 
should be perpendicular to it, i.e., running along the 
90 degrees line. Hence, let’s check for the left and 
right neighbouring gradient values. If the gradient 
at the present pixel is greater than its left and right 
neighbours, then it is considered an edge; else, it is 
discarded. This process gives single-pixel-thick edges.
4.   Now a hysteresis-based edge scanning is done. It 
is known that major important edges will be along 
curves, not as isolated points. A two-threshold 
scanning is done. The high threshold, Th, will decide 
the starting of the edge, and the Tl will decide the 
ending of the edge. Once this process is done, you get 
a binary map of the edges.
Implementation in Python
Let us see how this is implemented in Python using SciPy.

Overview

Having quantised the angles, the previously discussed 
non-maximum suppression algorithm is run to get single-
pixel-thick edges of the image.
4.   The final step is hysteresis edge detection. For our test 
image, a Th of 50 and Tl of 5 is used. This implies that an 
edge is started if the pixel grayscale value is greater than 
50, and is terminated when the grayscale value is less 
than 5. The edges are given a white colour, and the non-
edges are left black. Figure 6 is the final image obtained.
The source code of the article, which can be downloaded 
from http://www.linuxforu.com/article_source_code/sept12/
canny_edge.zip, is the implementation of the canny edge 
detection algorithm in Python. The module has a class 
called Canny, which takes in the path to the image, the 
sigma value for Gaussian blur, and the lower and upper 
thresholds. The class will finally give a binary image—0 for 
no edges and 255 for edges.  
The steps are numbered in the same order as above.
1.   First, the image (Figure 1) is loaded as a grayscale 
image array. The ndimage package from SciPy has 
routines for reading images. The imread function 
takes the filename string as input, and returns a 3D/2D 
array of pixel values. A Gaussian kernel with a chosen 
standard deviation and kernel size is applied to the 
image to remove any noise.
2.   A Prewitt operator is applied to create two images, 
horizontally differentiated and vertically differentiated. 
Let us call them gradx and grady respectively. The 
gradient map is given by issuing the following command:
grad = squareroot(gradx^2+grady^2)
The angle of the gradient at each point is arctan( grady / 
gradx ).
3.   Now, let’s quantise the angles to help the non-maximum 
suppression. The division is as follows:
a. 0-22.5 or 157.5-202.5 or 337.5-360 => 0
b. 22.5-67.5 or 202.5-247.5		
  => 45 degrees
c. 67.5-112.5 or 247.5 to 292.5	  => 90 degrees
d. 112.5-157.5 or 292.5-337.5	
  => 135 degrees.

FOSS Events
E
very year, since 2009, enthusiasts of Python, the free 
and open source programming language created by 
Guido van Rossum, and used in everything from 
embedded systems to Web frameworks and space shuttles, 
have been congregating for an annual conference on the 
language in and around Bengaluru.
The conference was flagged off in 2009, as a result of 
discussions in ‘BangPypers’, a community that began in the 
city way back in early 2005 in order to bring together Python 
programming enthusiasts. The first conference was held at the 
Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru.
Noufal Ibrahim, a Python programmer who works as 
a consultant for the Internet Archive in the city, played the 
key role in getting the first PyCon India on the ground. He 
reminisces about his experiences: “I was always interested in 
Python and the larger community but had never done anything 
significant for it. I attended a meeting of the BangPypers 
and there was some talk of conducting a PyCon in India. It 
seemed like a project that was a mix of the impossible and 
the attainable, which made it irresistible. I jumped at the 
opportunity and that led to the first PyCon in 2009.”
Passionate people like Noufal and Anand Chitipothu, who 
has been the Web master of the PyCon India websites, have been 
instrumental in the successful run of the conferences since then.
In 2010, PyCon India was organised in Bengaluru; it 
moved to Pune in 2011. The organisers of this conference 
have formed a society aptly called the Indian Python Software 
Society (IPSS). The late programmer and free software thinker, 
Kenneth Gonsalves, had played a key role in registering the 
society and served as its president for the first year.
This year the conference will be held at Dharmaram 
Vidyakshetram at the Christ University Campus in Bengaluru 
from September 28 to 30. The conference highlights are 
keynotes by Django co-founder Jacob Kaplan-Moss, and 
PSF director and author Dr David Mertz. There will also be a 
number of other interesting talks and tutorials on a variety of 
topics related to Python.
IPSS works closely with its parent organisation, the 
Python Software Foundation (PSF), which holds the 
intellectual property rights to the Python programming 
language. PSF is sponsoring  PyCon India this year.
The other supporters of the conference are Red Hat and 
Enthought, the scientific Python company. Enthought is the 
platinum sponsor and Red Hat the gold sponsor of the event.
The organisers of PyCon India have seen support for 
the language and the conference grow steadily since the 
days of BangPypers and the first PyCon India. Last year, 
in Pune, the conference attracted over 700 delegates, with 
large numbers coming from the academic community. This 
year, the organisers expect a similar or even bigger audience, 
considering the increased popularity of the language and its 
adoption within the software profession.
Python is a versatile language. Being free and open, it 
is ideally suited for start-ups and small companies that can 
work freely on their ideas without worrying about intellectual 
property or licensing encumbrances. That is not to say that it 
isn’t suitable for large companies. Python finds a fit in almost 
any conceivable software project—whether it is that hobby 
application you work on during your weekends at home, or 
that mission-critical software framework that holds together 
the businesses of Fortune 500 companies.
You can learn more about PyCon India 2012 by visiting 
the conference website at http://in.pycon.org.
We raise a toast to Python and wish PyCon India all 
success!  
Being the hub of software development and 
off-shoring, Bengaluru plays host to a number 
of conferences, many of them related to FOSS. 
PyCon India is one such show that has been 
increasing in popularity over the past few years.

VI execution 
 While writing shell scripts in vi, have you ever 
considered the time wasted by going in and out of vi to 
test your commands by executing them on the command line?
To increase your productivity, it would be a lot 
quicker if you could execute these commands from 
within the editor and view their output before writing 
them to your script.
This is possible and quite straightforward to do.  Enter 
the following command within vi:
:!testscript
(i.e., the colon and exclamation mark followed by the 
command that you want to run.)
Then enter your command as you would at the $ or # 
prompt.  The command executes, the result is displayed, 
and you are prompted to press Return to continue. Press 
Enter and start using vi as you were doing earlier.

Copy files securely! 
 Sometimes you may be using ftp or any other 
GUI-based tool, which may or may not be the 
most secure option. So try the scp command, which 
copies files securely. scp, or the secure copy command, 
makes use of SSH and a session key for authentication 
when transferring files from a remote system to your 
local system. It can copy files from remote systems to 
local systems, multiple files from remote systems to 
local systems, files between two remote systems, files 
from local systems to remote systems, etc.
The example below will make this clearer. 
Copy file amit.txt from xyz.edu server to your local dir /
mydir by user Ram.
$scp ram@xyz.edu:amit.txt /mydir
$scp amit.txt ram@xyz.edu:/my/remote/dir 
It can also be used to copy the directory name test as 
shown below:
$scp -r test ram@xyz.edu:/my/remote/dir/ 
When you run the above command, you will be 
prompted for your password. Provide it and the file gets 
copied to your /mydir.
Browse manual pages for more syntax and copy files 
without a worry.

Get to know the size of the RAM
 Here is a simple one-line command that will display 
the available RAM in MB.
$cat /proc/meminfo | awk ‘match($1,”MemTotal”) == 1 {print 
$2/1024}’

Merging video files 
 Often, we have multiple small clips of video that we 
need to join to make one big file. Here is a command 
that can be used to add multiple files.
Suppose you have video .avi.001, video .avi.002, etc, 
which need to be joined, run the following command and 
watch the entire video by playing the output file (video.avi):
#cat video.avi.* > video.avi
The command may take time to complete depending on 
the size of the video files.

Auto-insert text as a header in VIM
If you want to have headers or some text like ‘#!/bin/
bash’ or  ‘#include’ embedded when you open a file for 
C programming or bash, append the following lines in the 
.vimrc file:
autocmd BufNewFile *.py 0read ~/.vim/skeletons/skel_py
autocmd BufNewFile *.c 0read ~/.vim/skeletons/skel_c
skel_py and skel_c will hold all that you want to add 
when it is a new file with the extension ‘.py’ or ‘.c’.
You can use this tip to customise further, as per your 
requirements.
