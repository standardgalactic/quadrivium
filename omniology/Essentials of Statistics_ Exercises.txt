Solutions
Solution of Problem 1
As stated in section 2.5 of the Compendium, this number can be computed as a binomial coefﬁ-
cient:
N =
52
5

= 2598960
Solution of Problem 2
We know the number of possible poker hands N from Problem 1. Of these, only four hands are
royal ﬂush. Therefore, the probability becomes
P = 4
N =
4
2598960 =
1
649740 ≈0.00015%
Solution of Problem 3
We know the number of possible poker hands N from Problem 1. We have to calculate the number
n of hands with straight ﬂush. There are four possibilities for the suit. There are ten possibilities
for the value of the highest card (from 5 to ace). This gives
4 · 10 = 40
possibilities. However, we have to subtract the number of hands with royal ﬂush (Problem 2) from
this number. In total we get
n = 40 −4 = 36
hands with straight ﬂush. The probability of a straight ﬂush thus becomes
P = n
N =
36
2598960 ≈
1
72193 ≈0.0014%
Solution of Problem 4
We know the number of possible poker hands N from Problem 1. We have to calculate the number
n of hands with four of a kind. There are 13 possible values (ace, king, queen, etc.) of the four
cards, and moreover 48 possibilities for the ﬁfth card. In total this is
n = 13 · 48 = 624
hands with four of a kind. The probability of four of a kind thus becomes
P = n
N =
624
2598960 =
1
4165 ≈0.024%
Solution of Problem 5
We know the number of possible poker hands N from Problem 1. We have to calculate the number
n of hands with “full house”. There are 13 possibilities for the value of the group of three cards.

Solution of Problem 7
We determine the number n of hands with a straight. For the value of the highest card, there are
ten possibilities (from 5 to ace). For each of the ﬁve cards, there are four possibilities for the suit
(spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs). This gives
10 · 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 = 10240
possibilities. However, we have to subtract the number of hands with a straight ﬂush (Problem 3)
and the number of hands with a royal ﬂush (Problem 2) from this number. In total we get
n = 10240 −36 −4 = 10200

If we know, say, that X takes the value 12, then we can conclude that Y takes the value 0 (since
both dice in that case show 6). Consequently, X and Y are not independent.

Solution of Problem 18
We know the point probabilities from Problem 16. Since the point probabilities are symmetrical
around 7, we get at once
E(X) = 7
Let us compute the variance using the formula var(X) = E(X2) −E(X)2 from section 4.5. We
get
E(X2) =

P(X = k) · k2 = 1974

= 54.8
and thus
var(X) = E(X2) −E(X)2 = 54.8 −72 = 5.8

Solution of Problem 19
Let us ﬁnd the covariance using the formula
Cov(X, Y ) = E(X · Y ) −E(X) · E(Y )
from section 4.6. From the point probabilities it appears that
E(X) = 7 and E(Y ) = 0
It is somewhat tedious to calculate E(X · Y ). There is a total of 36 possible sample points (r, s)
when the red and the black die are thrown. For any given sample point (r, s), we know that X
takes the value r + s, whereas Y takes the value r −s. The product X · Y thus takes the value
(r + s)(r −s) = r2 −s2. The expected value of X · Y is the mean of these 36 values, i.e.
E(X · Y ) = 1

Solutions
We therefore ﬁnd the covariance
Cov(X, Y ) = E(X · Y ) −E(X) · E(Y ) = 0 −7 · 0 = 0
The covariance of independent random variables is always 0 (section 4.6). We have shown in
16 that X and Y are not independent. This problem therefore shows that we cannot conclude
conversely that the variables are independent when the covariance is 0.
Solution of Problem 20
Chebyshev’s Inequality says
P(|X −µ| ≥nσ) ≤1
n2
In words this means that the probability that X takes values more than n standard deviations away
from its expected value is small when n is large. Of course this is only interesting for n > 1 since
every probability a priori is at most 1.
Solution of Problem 21
The number k is obviously binomially distributed with parameters n and p = 1/2. It is seen that
k/n lies in the interval [0.45 ; 0.55] if and only if k lies in the interval [0.45n ; 0.55n]. Vi may
therefore calculate Pn using the formula for the point probabilities of the binomial distribution.
The results are seen here:

Since k has expected value np = n/2 and standard deviation √npq =

n/4 = √n/2, it
follows that k/n will have expected value µ = 1/2 and standard deviation σ = 1/2√n. Note that
the the standard deviation converges to 0 as n goes to inﬁnity.
Chebyshev’s Inequality gives

By comparison with the ﬁrst table, it is seen that Chebyshev’s Inequality really is satisﬁed.
The Law of Large Numbers says that Pn converges to 100% as n goes to inﬁnity. We note that
this is a direct consequence of Chebyshev’s Inequality and also appears very clearly from both of
the above tables.
The Central Limit Theorem tells that the distribution of k/n approaches a normal distribution
when n goes to inﬁnity. Thus Pn can be approximated by

Solution of Problem 29
If the coin is fair, then k originates from a Bin(10, 1

variable X has the following point probabilities:
k

10
P(X = k)
· · ·
24.6%
20.5%
11.7%
4.4%
1.0%
0.1%
The test’s signiﬁcance probability P is the probability of having k or more “heads” when tossing
a fair coin ten times, i.e.
P = P(X ≥k)
For k = 8 we get P = 5.5% and H0 must be accepted. For k = 9 we get P = 1.1%. A test at
signiﬁcance level 5% should therefore reject H0 if k ≥9, and accept H0 if k ≤8. The risk of
committing an error of type I is thus 1.1%.
If the true value of p is 0.75, then the strength of the test is
P(Y ≥9) = 24.4%
and the risk of an error of type II is
P(Y ≤8) = 75.6%
Here Y is a Bin(10; 0.75) distributed random variable.
Solution of Problem 30
The number X of heads is obviously Bin(10, 1
2) distributed. In order to calculate P1 we simply
use the point probabilities since this is doable in this case, and moreover we are at the borderline
with respect to when the normal approximation may be used. We get
P1
=
P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)

Since there are six categories and we have estimated one parameter from the data, the statistic
must be compared with the χ2 distribution with df = 6 −1 −1 = 4 degrees of freedom. Table
C.3 gives a signiﬁcance probability of more than 50%.
Conclusion: It is reasonable to claim that the number of goals per game is Poisson distributed.
Solution of Problem 36
The expected wait until success is the reciprocal probability of success:
E(V ) =

1/6 = 6
The number of failures before success, W = V −1, is Geo(1/6) distributed. W and V have the
same variance:
var(V ) = var(W) = q/p2 = 30
Solution of Problem 37
We get
P(W < n) = 1 −P(W ≥n) = 1 −qn
where as always q = 1 −p.

These expected values are almost identical with those from Problem 35. Since the Poisson distri-
bution is a more natural choice and also requires one parameter less, there is no reason to explain
the observations using a negative binomial distribution.
Solution of Problem 44
A’s lifespan is the wait until an event (death) that occurs spontaneously with intensity λA = 1/5.
Similarly, B’s lifespan is the wait until an event that occurs spontaneously with intensity λB =
1/10. The lifespan of the device is thus the wait until an event that occurs spontaneously with
intensity λ = λA + λB = 3/10. The expected lifespan of the device thus becomes λ−1 ≈3.3
years.
Solution of Problem 45
The expected wait until the ﬁrst component dies is seen to be 2.5 years as in the previous problem.
After this, the expected wait until the second component dies is seen to be ﬁve years. The expected
lifespan of the device thus becomes 7.5 years.

The information Φ(u) = P(X ≤0) = 0.10 implies u = −1.28 (Table C.2). This yields 0 =
5 −1.28 · σ and thereby σ = 5/1.28 = 3.91. The variance thus becomes σ2 = 15.3.

The signiﬁcance probability thus becomes

where FStudent is the distribution function for Student’s t distribution with df = 4−1 = 3 degrees
of freedom. It is seen in Table C.4 that FStudent(3.30) is a bit above 0.975. Since the signiﬁcance

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

the empirical variance 18 is markedly greater than 10; the explanation lies in the very small size
of the sample.
Solution of Problem 58
If the variances σ2
1 and σ2
2 are different, then the problem is unsolvable (this is the so-called Fisher-
Behrens problem mentioned in the Compendium). Therefore, we ﬁrst have to test the auxiliary
hypothesis
H∗
0 : σ1 = σ2
against the alternative
H∗
1 : σ1 ̸= σ2
Only if H∗
0 is accepted, the original problem can be solved.
The ﬁrst sample has mean ¯x = 7 and empirical variance s2
1 = 18. The second sample has
mean ¯y = 13 and empirical variance s2
2 = 15.3. We calculate the statistic (section 17.7 and 17.9)
v = s2

s2

as well as

The signiﬁcance probability is
P = 2 · (1 −FFisher(v∗))
where FFisher is the distribution function of Fisher’s F distribution with 4 −1 = 3 degrees of
freedom in both numerator and denominator. Table C.5 gives FFisher(5.39) = 90% which implies
FFisher(1.17) < 90%. We thus get
P > 2 · (1 −90%) = 20%
With a signiﬁcance probability as large as that, we accept the auxiliary hypothesis H∗
0.
Now we are ready to test H0 against H1. The procedure is described in section 17.8. The
“pooled” variance is computed as
s2
pool = 3s2

The signiﬁcance probability is now seen to be
P = 1 −FStudent(−t) = 1 −FStudent(2.08) < 5%
where we have looked up FStudent(2.08) in Table C.4 under df = 4 + 4 −2 = 6. Since P is less
than 5%, we reject H0.

The signiﬁcance probability is

where FFisher is the distribution function of Fisher’s F distribution with k −1 = 2 degrees of
freedom in the numerator and n −k = 9 degrees of freedom in the denominator. Table C.5 shows
FFisher(1.81) < 90% and thus P > 10%. Consequently, we accept H0.

and thereby we reject H0 in favour of H1.

We now calculate the two statistics:
t+ = 9 + 2 + 7.5 + 10 + 3 + 6 = 37.5 and t−= 5 + 7.5 + 1 + 4 = 17.5
At this point we can check that t+ + t−= 55 = 10 · (10 + 1)/2, which shows that we have
computed correctly.
If the pesticide has had an effect, the di’s should be mainly positive. So we have to investigate
whether t−is “extremely” small. Table C.8 shows that the signiﬁcance probability is considerably
more than 5%. Therefore, we cannot prove any signiﬁcant effect of the pesticide.

Solutions
The statistic tx is the sum of the n ranks corresponding to Line 1:
tx = 18 + 23 + 3 + 15 + 9 + 2 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 19 + 6 + 14 + 5 + 12 = 157
Since we are not testing against any particular alternative hypothesis, we have to consider the
minimum
t := min{tx, n(n + m + 1) −tx} = min{157, 207} = 157
We look up in Table C.9 under n = 14 and m = 11 and ﬁnd the number 151. Since t is not less
than the table value, we cannot prove any signiﬁcant difference between the number of defects at
signiﬁcance level α = 10%.
Solution of Problem 69
We may use the normal approximation to Wilcoxon’s test for two sets of observations. We know
that tx is normally distributed with expected value
µ = n(n + m + 1)
2
= 7550
and standard deviation
σ =

nm(n + m + 1)
12
=
√
62917 = 251
So we have to look at the standard normally distributed statistic
z = tx −µ
σ
= −2.18
This gives a signiﬁcance probability of
Φ(−2.18) = 1.5%
We see that there were signiﬁcantly fewer defects in Line 1.
