Way N.1: PayPal
what you need:
IBAN/ANON Card – you can buy one cheap from: Tobacco2012
1:Set up a real PP account using your real anon. It is easy to do but if you don't know how you can 
ask Tobacco2012 to sell you a guide within his real anon CC.
2: Wait for validation
3: Get an anonymous SIM card
4: Register yourself to liqpay
5: From PP account create a donation button
6: Using stolen CC's deposit some money using the donation button. (my advice is not much from 
each card, around £20/30 per card is good)
7: Now buy bitcoins using the PP card by liqpay
8: Transfer your money to your BTC address ;)
9: Send me a coffee ;) 1HQSVEMquzg5oWCoU14bi8XCU4FPXwm5o
This way is tested and 100% working.
Way N.2: Sim Card
what you need:
A bunch of SIM cards
1: Check if your SIM card is refillable online. If so then go on.
2: Now fill your SIM cards using CC's. Its better to do different refills of low amounts.
3: Now subscribe a wallet on blockchain.info (use tor!!)
4: Now make an instant deposit by telephone:
1: select country.
2: select big amount.
3: select payphone way.
4: call and wait.
Good! You now have your BTC in your wallet, you can easily transfer to your address and spend 
them. I tried this using a Polish SIM card. This way has high fees but has highest success rate.
Way N.3: Poker
To do this you need an initial investment of 2BTC.
1: Go to https://www.switchpoker.com/en and register an a REAL account for you.
2: Refill that account using 2 BTC.
3: When asked use REAL information of yourself.
4: Now register a second FAKE account using CC information (use tor!)
5: Refill fake account with CC information.
6: Now, using tor and you normal browser, play the 2 accounts against each other and win on real 
account.
7: Do some real play to avoid suspicion on real account.
8: After couple of days withdraw your winnings.
9: You have 50% chance of being asked for ID when you withdraw, send it without problem as you 
won this money legally ;)
