About the Authors
Robert A. Wood, MD, is Professor of Pediatrics and International Health and
Chief of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. After receiving his medical degree
from the University of Rochester School of Medicine, he completed his resi-
dency in pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University, where he also completed
an allergy and immunology fellowship. Dr. Wood is an internationally recog-
nized expert in food allergy and childhood asthma and has published over
100 manuscripts in scientific journals, including the New England Journal 
of Medicine, JAMA, Pediatrics, and the Journal of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology, as well as two books and numerous book chapters. He is Deputy
Editor of the journal Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, was Associate Editor
of the Annals of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and has served on the edi-
torial board of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. He is on the
Board of Directors of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology. He 
personally cares for over 4,000 patients with food allergy and has a special
interest in this topic as someone with a severe, lifelong peanut allergy.
Joe Kraynak is a freelance author who has written and co-authored dozens of
books on topics ranging from slam poetry to computer basics. Joe teamed up
with Dr. Candida Fink to write his first book in the For Dummies series, Bipolar
Disorder For Dummies, where he showcased his talent for translating the par-
lance of psychiatry into plain-spoken practical advice. He then tackled Flipping
Houses For Dummies with legendary real estate pro Ralph Roberts to produce
the ultimate guide for real estate rehabbers. In Food Allergies For Dummies, Joe
returns to the doctor’s office with world-renowned allergist, Robert Wood, MD,
to pen the definitive guide to living well with food allergies.


Dedication
From Robert Wood: To my wife, Renee Melly Wood, DVM, for her unbeliev-
able patience and support, to my parents, Dr. Bob and Carol Wood, for their
consistent support and lifelong example of hard work, integrity, and compas-
sion to all, and to my brother David, for all he taught me about life before his
tragic death.
From Joe: In memory of my brother Mitch, a brilliant physician and an out-
standing human being who passed away well before his time.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Although we wrote the book, dozens of other talented individuals con-
tributed to its conception, development, and perfection. Special thanks go to
acquisitions editor Lindsay Lefevere, who chose us as the authors and guided
us through the tough part of getting started. Jennifer Connolly, our project
editor, deserves a round of applause for acting as a very patient collaborator
and choreographer — shuffling chapters back and forth, shepherding the 
text and photos through production, and asking a whole lot of questions to
ensure that you would have all your questions answered. We also tip our hats
to the production crew for doing such an outstanding job of transforming a
loose collection of text and illustrations into such an attractive bound book.
We owe special thanks to the folks at FAAN (Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis
Network), especially FAAN founder Anne Munoz-Furlong, for gathering the
recipes for the delectable dishes served up in the appendix and for writing
the foreword for our book.
We owe a huge debt of gratitude to a few people who have played a special
role in moving the field of food allergy forward. From a scientific standpoint,
Drs. Hugh Sampson and Scott Sicherer at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine and 
Dr. Wesley Burks at Duke University School of Medicine led the way in moving
the study of food allergy to the 21st century. From a personal standpoint, we
would once again like to acknowledge Anne Munoz-Furlong for what she and
FAAN have done to provide the leadership and resources that we all rely on
to educate everyone — from patients to schools to doctors — about what it
means to live with food allergy.
We owe special thanks to our technical editor, accomplished allergist John M.
James, MD, for ferreting out technical errors in the manuscript, helping guide
its content, and offering his own advice, guidance, and tips.

Foreword
A
s the incidence of food allergy continues to increase in the U.S., particu-
larly in children, the need for an easy-to-read book also has increased.
With Food Allergies For Dummies, Dr. Wood has provided all of us with a
handy reference tool.
As someone who has a peanut allergy, he is in a unique position to write this
book. Dr. Wood understands this topic personally and professionally. His
easy-to-read writing style and calm demeanor make him a favorite among
patients throughout the country and around the world.
The articles he writes for parents are reprinted by organizations around the
world. At FAAN’s annual meetings, Dr. Wood is a favorite speaker. Families
travel thousands of miles to visit his clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore, Maryland. For those with young children, he helps unravel the
mystery and brings a diagnosis and treatment plan that helps the children
and their families. Teens, the highest risk group for severe or fatal reactions,
visit his office to hear from someone who really does understand the oppos-
ing forces of striving for independence while having to be cautious and
always ready for the unexpected reaction.
His writing style leaves you feeling like you know him. Most importantly, he
touches on all the key topics — including why peanuts cause so many reac-
tions, why food allergy is increasing, and where you are likely to find aller-
gens. Dr. Wood shares his personal experiences with peanut allergy reactions,
reminding us all that even one of the world’s leading experts sometimes has
reactions. He helps us learn from his mistakes and how to assess risks to min-
imize stress or worry.
If you are looking for a book that you can sit and read quietly, this is it. If you
need a book you can use as a reference tool, this one fits that bill too. You
won’t be disappointed with Food Allergies For Dummies. You’ll find yourself
recommending it to everyone you know, just like the patients who travel long
distances just to speak to Dr. Wood.

Food Allergies For Dummies 

Introduction
W
hen I was about nine months old, my mother gave me a bit of peanut
butter on her finger. My face immediately doubled in size. Fortunately,
I grew up in a small town and the hospital was only a few minutes away. My
mother, who is a pediatric nurse, took me straight to my pediatrician, who
also happened to be my father. They quickly treated me and made the diag-
nosis based on the reaction alone.
When I turned two years old, I had my second reaction. The standard practice at
the time was that when you turned two, you would retry any food you had been
allergic to as an infant. Bad idea, but at least I got to visit my father at work again.
After that second incident, I led a charmed life. We avoided peanuts and my
parents established strict rules around the house. My seven sisters and
brothers followed the rules, and I managed to stay safe at home. Away from
home, I avoided obvious peanut products but ate everything else — baked
goods, desserts, ice cream, candy, you name it. Back then, we had little
knowledge of food allergy and certainly no precautionary labels on foods. In
retrospect I believe I was just lucky. I was especially lucky because prescrib-
ing and carrying epinephrine were not standard practices in those days. I had
no real strategy to avoid peanuts, no action plan, no medications. And this
was not because proper medical care was unavailable. In fact, I received the
best of care and was actually a patient of the world’s most renowned pedi-
atric allergist of the 1950s and ’60s — Dr. Jerome Glaser.
My charmed existence was rudely interrupted by a tainted brownie in ninth
grade. The cafeteria had changed the recipe after receiving a large supply of
surplus peanut butter. It really was an awakening for my parents and me. I
started paying more attention to what I was eating — as did the cafeteria
workers in my school — and was given a vial of epinephrine and a syringe to
carry around with me.
A few years later, I experienced another severe reaction when I ate a sugar
cookie from a bakery that must have been contaminated. I have since had
three more reactions — one to spaghetti when I was in college, one to a piece
of coconut cream pie, and a third to another contaminated cookie. 
Undoubtedly, my personal experience of living with a severe peanut allergy
coupled with the fact that I was raised by medical professionals led me down
the path to becoming an allergist specializing in food allergy. Currently, I per-
sonally care for over 4,000 patients with food allergies, and I have treated
thousands more over the course of my career. I’m also actively and passion-
ately involved in performing cutting-edge research to track down the root

cause of food allergies, discover superior preventions and treatment options,
and hopefully discover a cure.
In Food Allergies For Dummies, I pass along the knowledge and insights I’ve
gathered over my nearly 50 years of living with, studying, researching, and
treating food allergies. I present strategies and tips for avoiding exposure and
preventing reactions. I reveal medications and treatment options that can
quell symptoms ranging from minor to severe. I point out unproven, untested
options that simply waste your time and money. I show you exactly what to
do in the event of an emergency. And, I offer guidance on how to live well
with food allergies at home, school, and work; while dining out; and as you’re
traveling for business or pleasure. 
My capable co-author and I thoroughly enjoyed collaborating on this project
to create what we believe is the best food allergy management guide on the
planet. We hope that you and your family, friends, teachers, and childcare
and healthcare providers enjoy reading this book as much as we enjoyed
writing it. We also hope that the information contained in this book protects
you from harm and improves your quality of life for years to come.
About This Book
On a daily basis, I see patients who have been undiagnosed, misdiagnosed,
and over-diagnosed. Often, they have no idea which foods trigger their symp-
toms, because they haven’t been properly tested and evaluated. In some
cases, their doctors subject them to too many tests, misinterpret the test
results, and saddle their patients with an overly restrictive diet that not only
compromises the patient’s quality of life but can actually lead to malnutri-
tion. I’ve seen young children whose diets are unnecessarily restricted to less
than ten foods! 
I don’t want you or your loved ones to suffer unnecessarily from a bad or
nonexistent diagnosis. In Food Allergies For Dummies, I arm you with the infor-
mation and insight you need to assess the care you’re receiving and team up
with your doctor to identify the foods that ail you, without mistakenly elimi-
nating from your diet foods that are perfectly safe. An accurate diagnosis is
key to successful treatment and a fuller culinary and nutritional life.
Food Allergies For Dummies can’t and doesn’t even attempt to act as a surro-
gate for skilled and knowledgeable medical care. Your family doctor and aller-
gist play the leading roles in your diagnosis and treatment. This book plays a
supporting role, expediting your diagnosis and treatment and enhancing your
life by:
 Assisting you in determining if and when you need to seek professional
medical advice for diagnosis and treatment based on your symptoms.
2
Food Allergies For Dummies 

 Guiding you in selecting the medical professionals who are best quali-
fied to diagnose and treat food allergies (and are covered on your health
insurance policy). 
 Providing you with the information you need to more effectively team up
with your healthcare providers to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and
obtain the most effective medical treatments, without overly restricting
your diet.
 Empowering you to take control of your allergies by presenting practi-
cal, plain-English advice, tips, and strategies for living well with food
allergies at home, work, and school, while dining out, and on vacation or
business trips.
 Saving your life by showing you how to construct your own food allergy
emergency kit and follow life-saving procedures if you or a loved one
experiences a severe allergic reaction.
Although Food Allergies For Dummies is packed from cover to cover with
valuable information, advice, and tips, you don’t have to read it from cover to
cover. We broke the information down into easily digestible parts, chapters,
sections, subsections, and even sub-subsections, so you can dip in at any
point in the book and find just the information you need. Of course, I don’t
want to discourage you from reading the entire book — if you skip around
too much, you’re likely to skip right over some golden nuggets.
Conventions Used in This Book
I don’t like to think of my book as conventional, but I do have some standard
ways of presenting material. For example, whenever I introduce a new, some-
what technical term, such as anaphylaxis, I italicize it. A commonly used term
that’s not necessarily a technical term, I enclose “in quotes,” but for the life of
me, I can’t really remember a chapter in which I actually quoted something.
Web site addresses appear in monofont and never hyphenated, even if they
run longer than a line of text; simply type the address into your Web browser
exactly as it appears.
In almost every chapter, I include intriguing research on food allergy or sto-
ries about people who’ve walked into my clinic with a suspected food allergy
and emerged after successful diagnosis and treatment feeling a whole lot
better. These stories aren’t necessarily about real people — to protect their
privacy, I composed composites of real case studies I’ve diagnosed and
treated over my many years in practice.
In a few chapters I include fill-in-the-blank forms you can scribble on.
Although you can fill out these forms in the book, you may want to make
copies to write on, especially if you borrowed the book from your library or
3
Introduction

plan on re-selling it on eBay when you’re done with it. These forms are
incredibly valuable at empowering you to take a more pro-active role in your
diagnosis and treatment.
Even though you see two author names on the cover of this book — Robert
Wood and Joe Kraynak — you see “I” throughout the book when I, Robert
(you can call me Dr. Wood or Dr. Bob), am offering expert advice, presenting
research data, and describing patients. Joe’s the word maestro who fiddled
with the language to make it sound just right. Although Joe knows much
more about food allergies after having worked with me, he’s careful not to
hand out medical advice.
What You’re Not to Read
The best way to ingest and digest the information in this book is to read
every word of it from cover to cover. Joe and I toiled tirelessly to provide you
with everything you need to know and do to live well with your food allergy,
and I’d hate for you to fast forward through the juicy parts.
You can, however, safely skip anything you see in a gray shaded box. I stuck
case studies and technical information you really don’t need to know in these
boxes, to clue you into the fact that this is optional reading material. I doubt
that you’ll want to skip the case studies, because they provide real world exam-
ples of people who struggle with the same food allergy issues that you and
your family now face, and they offer hope for a full, symptom-free life ahead.
Foolish Assumptions
In some books that cover advanced topics, authors must assume that their
readers already understand some basic topics or have acquired beginning-
level skills. For example, if this were a book about biochemistry, you’d have
to know a little about chemistry, first. To read, understand, and apply the
information in this book to your life requires no prerequisites. This book,
along with expert medical care and a moderate amount of cooperation from
those around you, are all you need to start feeling better.
I do, however, make a few foolish assumptions about who you are. I figure
your situation matches one or more of the following scenarios:
 You experience unexplained symptoms that seem to arise or worsen
after eating.
 Your doctor has diagnosed you as having a food allergy, but you’re still
experiencing symptoms.
4
Food Allergies For Dummies 

 Your doctor has diagnosed you as having a food allergy and placed you
on a severely restricted diet, and you’re determined to find ways to
introduce more variety into your diet and live a fuller life.
 You’re a parent or caregiver of someone who has food allergies, and you
want to know what you could and should be doing to help.
 You’re a medical professional who needs or wants to learn more about
food allergies in order to diagnose and treat your patients more effectively.
 You’re a teacher or school administrator who wants some definitive
answers about food allergies, so you can more effectively discern real
risks from overblown claims and put an effective and reasonable food
allergy policy into place.
 Your friend has a food allergy, and you want to know what you can do 
to help.
 You’re just plain curious.
How This Book Is Organized
I wrote this book so you could approach it in either of two ways. You can
read the book from cover-to-cover or pick up the book and flip to any chapter
for a quick, stand-alone mini-course on a specific food allergy topic. To help
you navigate, I divvied up the 19 chapters that make up the book into five
parts. Here, I provide a quick overview of what I cover in each part.
Part I: Feasting on Food 
Allergy Fundamentals
This part begins with a primer that touches on almost every topic covered in
the book, so you can accelerate from 0 to 60 in about 18 pages. I proceed to
present you with an explanation of the food-allergy connection, lead you on
an exploration of common causes and symptoms, point out the top allergens
and their favorite hiding places, and finish up with some practical advice on
effectively dealing with the very common, often scary peanut allergy.
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope:
Diagnosis and Treatment
The key to whipping food allergies is to arrive at an accurate diagnosis, elimi-
nate the problem foods, and treat any lingering symptoms or unexpected
5
Introduction

reactions with allergy medications. In this part, I show you how to work with
your doctor to streamline the diagnostic process, identify the specific foods
that are triggering your reactions, and develop an effective treatment plan to
keep reactions at bay.
Here you develop skills for deciphering food labels, so you can more effec-
tively avoid the foods that ail you. I reveal the most effective medications for
providing symptomatic relief, and I warn you of unproven, often costly, alter-
native tests and treatments. Finally, I present cutting edge research that may
lay the path to an eventual cure.
Part III: Living Well with 
Your Food Allergies
After you step out of your doctor’s office with diagnosis and perhaps pre-
scriptions in hand, you return to your daily life and need to know how to
manage your food allergy in your day-to-day activities. The chapters in this
part show you how to apply the information your doctor provided to your
workaday and play-a-day world, so you can more safely and fully enjoy your
life. Here you gain the knowledge and skills required to cope with your food
allergies at home, on the road, in daycare, in preschool, and from kinder-
garten to your senior year in high school.
In this part, I also offer tips that show teens and tweens how to play a more
active role in managing their food allergies in the face of sometimes daunting
peer pressure. I show you how likely it is (or isn’t) that you will eventually
outgrow your food allergy, and offer some tips that may assist you in increas-
ing your chances.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without a Part of Tens. Turn to this part
for a list of ten key food allergy lessons to pass along to your children, ten
tips to enlighten your child’s caregiver at daycare or preschool, ten common
dietary substitutions to help out in the kitchen, and the top ten food allergy
Web sites where you can gather even more advice and support.
Appendixes: Allergy-Friendly 
Recipes and Other Treats
Food allergies may reduce your recipe box to a meager collection of index
cards for only the blandest of dishes. In this part, you begin to restock your
6
Food Allergies For Dummies 

box with several time-tested, patient-recommended recipes that treat the
palate, satisfy your appetite, and nourish your body all at the same time. 
FAAN (Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network) generously provided me
access to its vast collection of recipes, and I selected the recipes that my
patients most often recommend. 
In this part, I also include a collection of food-allergy-related terms and their
definitions, making it easy for you to look up a definition as you’re reading
the book or doing your own extra research.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I’ve sprinkled icons in the margins to cue you in on dif-
ferent types of information that call out for your attention. Here are the icons
you’ll see and a brief description of each.
If you remember nothing else in a particular chapter, remember anything
that’s marked with one of these icons.
Tips provide insider insight from behind the scenes. When you’re looking for
a better, faster way to do something, check out these tips.
“Whoa!” This icon appears when you need to remain extra vigilant or seek
professional medical guidance before moving forward.
When I drift off and start using more doctor jargon than usual, I warn you by
marking the text with this “Technical Stuff” icon. I do, however, try my best to
present the more technical material in plain English.
Where to Go from Here
Think of this book as an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can grab a plate, start at
the beginning and read one chapter right after another, or you can dip in any
chapter and pile your plate high with the information it contains.
If you’re looking for a quick overview of food allergies along with their diag-
nosis and treatment, check out Chapter 1. Chapters 5 and 6 are key, so if
you’re skipping around, don’t miss these essential chapters. They contain
everything you need to know to obtain effective medical care and avoid the
foods that cause discomfort.
7
Introduction

If you’re already under the care of a doctor, and you’re satisfied with the
results, you can safely skip to any of the chapters in Part III to gather tips and
strategies for dealing with food allergies in different places and situations.
When you need some quick tips to pass along to your kids or their care-
givers, Part IV is the place to go. Here you can also find a list of dietary sub-
stitutions and food allergy Web sites.
If you get hungry, head to the appendix at the back of the book, where you
can find recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert.
Finally for some quick tips, tricks, and tools, check out the Cheat Sheet pro-
vided at the very beginning of this book, just past the front cover. Better yet,
tear it out (preferably not in the bookstore or from a library copy), and carry
the Cheat Sheet with you for quick reference.
Of course, after reading the book, you’re welcome to dip back into it at any
time to pick up something you missed or take a brief refresher course.
Exposures and reactions are not always preventable, so always carry your
medications just in case and be prepared for unexpected reactions.

W
hen your immune system wages war against the
very foods that nourish you, your body becomes
the battlefield. As your immune system mounts its attack
against the invading forces, your body bears the brunt and
responds with some form of dis-ease and discomfort —
hives, eczema, abdominal cramps, sneezing, wheezing,
fainting, or a host of other symptoms . . . perhaps even a
potentially deadly case of anaphylaxis.
You don’t have to be a casualty of the food allergy war.
Armed with the medical intelligence provided in this part,
you can gain a deeper understanding of the food–immune
system connection and can begin to identify the foods
that most commonly confuse the immune system. But
first, I provide a quick primer on food allergies to get you
up to speed in a hurry and expedite the process of remov-
ing offending foods from your diet, pacifying your immune
system, and enhancing your postdiagnosis life.

 Preventing and treating allergic reactions . . . today and in the future
W
hen you begin to suspect that you or one of your family members has
a food allergy, all sorts of questions pop up:
 How did I become allergic?
 What can I do to stop feeling so miserable?
 What should I do if I begin to have a reaction?
 Can my doctor cure me?
In this chapter, I get you up to speed in a hurry about food allergies. After
pointing out what is an allergy and what’s not, I show you how to spot the
common signs and symptoms, obtain an accurate diagnosis, avoid the foods
that ail you, and relieve your misery with symptomatic treatments. I also
reveal what researchers currently believe causes food allergies and some of
the possible future cures you have to look forward to.
Pinning Down Food Allergy: What’s an
Allergy, and What’s Not?
Due to a lack of accurate information and an overabundance of misinforma-
tion about food allergies, many people have developed misconceptions about
what a food allergy really is. Some people think that if you get sick after eating
a particular food, you’re allergic to that food. Others think that if a food makes
you tired, you’re allergic to it, or that a craving for a particular food is a sign

of allergy, or if your pulse rate rises after eating, you’re allergic. The general
public often lumps every adverse symptom they have after eating a food as
an allergic reaction when this, in fact, is not the case.
In the following sections, I define food allergy and then reveal some common
conditions that produce similar symptoms to those produced by food aller-
gies but are actually something quite different.
Defining food allergy
Food allergies are sort of like overprotective parents. Trying too hard to do
the best for their children, they often cause more harm. In the case of food
allergies, an overprotective immune system, attempting to defend you from
harmful viruses and bacteria, misidentifies harmless substances in foods as
harmful to your health and wages all-out warfare to purge them from your
system. This overreaction by the immune system may be enough to kill you. 
So what exactly is a food allergy? A food allergy is an immune system response
that creates antibodies to attack substances in a food that your immune system
identifies as harmful to you. In the process, the reaction releases huge stores
of chemical substances, including histamines, which cause symptoms ranging
from a mild case of hives to a potentially life-threatening system shutdown.
For a description of exactly what happens during an allergic reaction, refer to
Chapter 2.
Identifying imposters
Foods can make you feel sick for a variety of reasons, most of which have
nothing to do with food allergies. This leaves the door open to quackologists
selling all sorts of ineffective cures and treatments for a host of ailments that
they falsely attribute to food allergies. To avoid getting sucked in by misinfor-
mation, be aware that the following ailments are rarely, if ever, related to food
allergies:
 Food intolerances: The inability to digest a particular food, such as milk
or wheat, is typically related to a missing enzyme in the digestive system
that prevents a person from fully digesting the food.
 Food poisoning: Some foods may have toxins or bacteria that make you
sick. Just because a food makes you sick one time does not mean you’re
allergic to it, although you should have your doctor check it out.
 Histamine poisoning: When you have an allergic reaction, your body
releases histamine into your system, which causes most of the symp-
toms you experience. Some foods, including strawberries, chocolate,
wine, and beer, may contain enough histamine to produce similar reac-
tions, but these are not bona fide allergic reactions.
12
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

 Reactions to food additives: MSG (monosodium glutamate) and sulfites
often cause reactions, but in these cases, the body has a chemical reac-
tion, not an allergic reaction, to the additive, not to the food itself.
 Other common ailments: Food allergy is blamed for everything from
migraine headaches to irritable bowel syndrome, but most of these ail-
ments are caused by something other than a food allergy. Don’t waste
your time chasing the food allergy ghost. Work with your doctor to iden-
tify the real cause and obtain more effective treatments.
For additional information on reactions that are often mistaken for food
allergy reactions, check out Chapter 2.
Meeting the Many Faces of Food
Allergies: Signs and Symptoms
When your immune system flips out and starts dumping histamine into your
system, all sorts of nasty stuff can happen. The histamine can attack just
about every organ in your body, including your skin, lungs, and gastrointesti-
nal (GI) tract, triggering these common symptoms:
 Hives, swelling, or an itchy rash
 Itching or swelling of the lips, tongue, or mouth
 Tightening of the chest, hoarseness, or coughing
 Abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, or nausea
 Fainting or passing out, paleness, blueness, irregular heartbeat
 Coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing
 Fear of impending doom, panic, chills, sudden weakness
 Death, if effective emergency treatment is not immediately administered
Symptoms can appear within minutes after eating and completely disappear
in an hour or two after you eat the problem food, making diagnosis a snap. In
many cases, however, symptoms slowly creep up on you over the course of
several hours. If you’re allergic to a common food, such as wheat or milk, or
to several foods, and symptoms arise slowly and take a long time to go away,
you may not even suspect food allergy as the cause, and diagnosis can be
much more challenging.
An accurate diagnosis is the first step toward obtaining effective treatment.
See Chapter 2 for details about symptoms. In Chapter 5, I show you how to
team up with your doctor to obtain an accurate diagnosis and identify the
food or foods that are causing problems.
13
Chapter 1: Breaking Out with Food Allergies

Investigating the Conspiracy: Allergens
and Other Contributing Factors
When you experience an allergic reaction, your immediate concern is proba-
bly not what caused it but how to make it stop. After receiving some relief,
however, your curiosity is likely to get the better of you, and you may begin
to wonder why you have this condition in the first place.
The following sections explore the two factors that lead to the onset of food
allergies and the possible reason why some foods are more likely to trigger
allergy onset than others.
Digging up the root cause of food allergy
Research shows that the onset of food allergies is primarily due to a one-two
punch of nature and nurture — genetics and environment: 
1. You’re born genetically susceptible to some sort of allergic condition.
2. Exposure to even a small amount of the food sensitizes your immune
system to the food. Your immune system produces antibodies to attack
the food next time it enters your system. Upon your first exposure, you
may not experience symptoms; your immune system is just gearing up
for next time.
3. You consume the problem food again, and your immune system, now
sensitized to the allergen, leaps into action to purge the allergen from
your system. 
Food allergies typically show themselves in the first few months or years of
life, and food allergy sufferers often outgrow their allergies by the time
they’re teenagers. Some food allergies, however, such as allergies to fish and
shellfish appear later in life and rarely disappear over time. See Chapter 15
for details about your chances of outgrowing an allergy and for information
on the possibility of preventing the onset of food allergies.
Playing the blame game
When people get sick, they naturally try to blame someone or something for
their illness. They want to point fingers at the person who “gave me this
cold” or blame their chronic headaches on “work-related stress.” In the case
of food allergies, there’s plenty of blame to go around, as I point out in the fol-
lowing sections.

Blaming your parents: Genetic factors
Allergies run in families, but not as you may think. If one family member is
allergic to milk, another may be allergic to peanut or develop asthma. If one
or both parents have hay fever or asthma, their children may have hay fever,
asthma, a food allergy, a combination of the three, or no allergy at all. In
short, if any allergic condition is present in a family member, other family
members are more susceptible to developing an allergic condition, not neces-
sarily a food allergy.
For details on how genetics and environment co-contribute to the onset of
food allergies and to determine the probability that any new addition to your
family will develop food allergies, check out Chapter 2. Chapter 15 reveals
strategies for possibly preventing the onset of food allergies and the likeli-
hood of outgrowing particular food allergies.
Blaming your foods: Allergens 
When you’re allergic to a particular food, you may be tempted to blame the
food — “I like peanuts, but peanuts don’t like me.” But the food itself is only
partially to blame. 
Foods that commonly spark allergic reactions, such as peanuts, eggs, milk,
fish, and wheat, have uniquely structured protein molecules in them that
make them a more identifiable target for your immune system. How your
immune system responds to those proteins determines whether or not you
experience an allergic reaction.
Currently, the most effective treatments for food allergies are to avoid the
problem foods (to prevent reactions) and then relieve symptoms when reac-
tions do occur. Researchers are looking for ways to train the immune system
not to overreact. See Chapter 9 for details about the most promising research.
Labeling Your Maladies with a 
Doctor’s Diagnosis 
The first step in avoiding food allergy reactions and preventing future reac-
tions requires a trip to your doctor, who can record your history, initiate
allergy testing, rule out other potential causes, refer you to a qualified aller-
gist, and provide advice and medications to keep you healthy until you can
get in to see your allergist.
15
Chapter 1: Breaking Out with Food Allergies

Then, the real work begins, as your allergist performs a complete food allergy
workup to:
 Pin down food allergy as the cause of your symptoms.
 Identify the food or foods that trigger symptoms.
 Rule out foods that are suspected of triggering symptoms but really don’t.
In the following sections, I provide a brief overview of the diagnostic process
that leads from symptoms to cause. For additional guidance on obtaining the
most accurate diagnosis possible, skip to Chapter 5.
Finding a food-allergy savvy allergist 
Your family doctor is likely to refer you to an allergist she’s worked with in
the past. Many allergists, however, are more accustomed to working with hay
fever and other environmental allergies and less with food allergies. 
Knowing the benefits of a food-allergy savvy allergist
Choosing an allergist who’s experienced with food allergies benefits you in
three ways:
 The diagnosis may be quicker and less costly, because the allergist is
likely to perform tests that focus on food allergies rather than on a host
of other allergies. 
 The allergist may be more aware of the risks of false positive results —
test results that show you’re allergic to something you’re not really aller-
gic to. False positives often lead to overly restricted diets that lower
your quality of life and may even lead to malnutrition. 
 Because skin tests can cause serious reactions in people with severe
food allergies, the allergist is likely to have the necessary emergency
medications on hand to properly treat you. (Severe reactions to skin
tests are very rare.)
 The allergist won’t order controversial tests that have been used by
charlatans or quacks in the past. These tests can be very expensive and
have no real bearing on the ultimate diagnosis of food allergy.
Choosing an allergist with the right stuff
If you have input on selecting the allergist, look for a combination of the fol-
lowing qualities:
 Experience in diagnosing and treating food allergies.
 Excellent interpersonal skills, so the allergist can effectively work with
you to address all your concerns.
16
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

 Covered by your insurance, so you don’t have high out-of-pocket
expenses.
 Availability, so you can see the allergist as soon as possible and are
likely to have little trouble scheduling follow-up appointments.
For details on selecting a top-notch allergist with the knowledge and experience
required to diagnose and treat food allergies effectively, refer to Chapter 5.
Navigating the diagnostic process
A thorough food allergy workup consists of your medical history, a physical
exam, and one or more tests to determine if you are, in fact, allergic to certain
foods and to identify the problem foods. Your allergist is likely to perform
one or more of the following tests:
 Skin tests: Skin tests consist of applying a tiny amount of the suspected
allergen below the upper layer of the skin, usually by scratching or
pricking the skin. A skilled allergist tests only the foods he suspects may
cause reactions, based on the results of your history and physical exam,
so no more than a few pokes with a needle are ever required.
 Blood tests: Your allergist may draw a vial of blood and test it for the pres-
ence of antibodies that indicate the probability of an allergy to a specific
food. These blood tests are commonly referred to as RASTs (short for
radioallergosorbent tests) but more accurately called immunoassay for
specific IgE. IgE (or Immunoglobulin E ) is a type of antibody that your
immune system produces to attack a particular allergen. For each aller-
gen, your body produces a different IgE, so if you’re allergic to milk, your
blood has IgE to attack allergenic substances in milk.
 Food challenges: To confirm a positive test result or gather more diag-
nostic data, your doctor may perform a controlled food challenge, in
which you consume increasing amounts of a suspect food under your
doctor’s close supervision. 
Don’t try a food challenge at home. Food challenges carry a risk of serious
reactions. Only trained personnel with emergency treatment immediately
available should perform the test.
Considering food intolerances
Your body may react to certain foods in ways that can trick you into thinking
you have an allergy when you don’t. Instead of a food allergy, your body may
lack the necessary chemicals to digest a particular food, which is considered
an intolerance, not an allergy. Lactose intolerance is one such example, in
17
Chapter 1: Breaking Out with Food Allergies

which the body doesn’t have the enzyme (lactase) it needs to break down
milk sugars. 
A lactose intolerant person is likely to experience stomach cramps, nausea,
and vomiting — the same symptoms that may afflict someone who has a milk
allergy — but the diagnosis and treatments are very different. With lactose
intolerance, you can avoid milk or take a lactase supplement to enable you to
digest the milk sugars. With a milk allergy, avoiding milk products and treating
symptoms in the event of a severe reaction are the primary treatment options.
Battling Back with Medications,
Modifications, and Other Therapies
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but no matter how skilled your allergist
is, she can’t cure your food allergy at the present time. The best we allergists
can do at this point is identify the problem foods, instruct you on how best to
avoid them, and treat reactions when avoidance maneuvers fail, as they often
do. In some cases, you simply outgrow the allergy, as explained in Chapter 15.
In the following sections, I discuss the three options you have at your 
disposal — avoidance, symptomatic treatment, and one alternative therapy
that shows some promise.
Modifying your diet
The primary defense against future reactions is to stop eating what makes
you sick. Yeah, you just shelled out good money for a book that tells you
what you already knew. Avoidance, however, is more complicated and chal-
lenging than anyone can summarize in a bit of homespun wisdom. Effective
avoidance requires vigilance and a coordinated effort to prevent any amount
of the allergenic food from entering your system through measures, such as:
 Meticulously reading labels for hidden ingredients: I provide several
food allergy field guides in Chapter 6 to assist you with this task.
 Refusing foods from unknown or un-trusted sources: Even a well-
meaning friend can offer you what he considers an allergen-free batch
of cookies that has enough of the allergen in it (perhaps from a tainted
spoon or spatula) to trigger a reaction. If you’re ever unsure about the
specific ingredients or cannot confirm the absence of a particular ingre-
dient, don’t take chances with the food.
 Preparing foods properly to avoid cross-contamination: For example,
cross-contamination may occur if you’re allergic to milk and the same
knife is used to cut a piece of cheese and then slice the meat for your
18
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

sandwich. Chapter 10 provides guidelines for allergen-free food prepara-
tion and cooking.
 Cleaning eating surfaces thoroughly before sitting down to eat: In a
school cafeteria, for example, tables should be thoroughly scrubbed
down with a household cleaning solution to remove all remnants of an
allergen before an allergic student sits at the table to eat.
 Avoiding situations in which the allergen becomes airborne in high
enough concentrations to trigger a reaction: You may find yourself in this
situation if you’re allergic to peanuts and dine out at a restaurant where
other patrons are cracking open shelled peanuts or you’re allergic to fish
and are seated at a table close to the kitchen where fish is being fried.
When your immune system is genetically wired to overreact to a food aller-
gen, any amount of the allergen can trigger a reaction and potentially
increase the risk of more severe reactions in the future.
In Chapter 6, I provide most of the guidance and information you need to suc-
cessfully avoid problem foods by carefully reading food labels. Throughout
the book, I offer additional tips and strategies to prevent accidental exposure
to problem foods.
Muffling your symptoms with meds 
You can’t pop a pill or take a shot to cure your food allergies, but several
medications can help relieve symptoms when avoidance is not 100 percent
effective. Consult your allergist and stock your medicine cabinet and your
travel bag with medications that can provide symptomatic relief.
Chapter 7 offers detailed information on the most effective food allergy med-
ications and includes a Food Allergy Emergency Action Plan that helps you
plan in advance for even the most severe reaction. Here, I provide a brief
overview of medications that can assist in relieving your symptoms:
 Epinephrine: Giving someone who’s experiencing a severe allergic reac-
tion a shot of epinephrine (adrenaline) is like throwing a drowning
person a life preserver. If your doctor believes that you’re at risk for a
severe reaction, he can prescribe epinephrine autoinjectors that enable
you or someone you’re with to give you an immediate injection.
 Antihistamines: Benedryl (Diphendydramine) and other antihistamines
in the category of H1 blockers, given by mouth or by injection, can help
symptoms subside. Liquid forms or fast-dissolve pills may offer faster
relief, because your system can absorb them more readily.
 H2 blockers: Zantac (Ranitidine) and Tagamet (cimetidine), which are
commonly used to treat ulcers and acid indigestion are often effective,
especially when combined with antihistamines in the H1 class.
19
Chapter 1: Breaking Out with Food Allergies

 Inhalant medications: Albuterol and other asthma medications can help
if you have difficulty breathing, chest tightness, or coughing.
 Corticosteroids: Prednisone and other corticosteroids can help prevent
a recurrence in the hours following a severe reaction and prevent late
reactions, but they don’t work rapidly enough for emergency treatment. 
Confronting the alternative 
(therapy) crowd
Although some alternative therapies may assist by complementing well-
established medical treatments, most alternative therapies are useless at
best and counterproductive at worst. In addition, they’re often costly, your
insurance probably won’t pay for them, and they siphon off the time, energy,
and resources you would be better off investing in a proven medical diagno-
sis and treatments.
In the following sections, I provide a brief overview of the most useless alter-
native tests and treatments. In Chapter 8, I do a more thorough job of
debunking them and pointing out some therapies that may improve your
overall health and well being but have no proven track record of relieving
symptoms or curing allergy.
My mind is not completely sealed off to the possibility that more effective
treatments and perhaps a cure can come from somewhere other than the
established medical community. In fact, in Chapter 9, I shine the spotlight on
a Chinese herbal formula that actually holds out some promise for food
allergy sufferers. When I pick apart quack tests and treatments, I do it only to
show that proponents of these tests and treatments have little, if any, scien-
tific evidence to back up their claims, and I don’t want you spending your
time and money chasing after a treatment that’s certain to be ineffective.
Exposing the most dubious tests
If I were to tell you that I could diagnose your food allergy by watching you
swing a rubber chicken over your head, you’d probably question my cre-
dentials. Yet, people continue to subject themselves to tests that have no 
scientifically proven data to back them up. Here are some of the more ques-
tionable tests:
 Cytotoxic testing douses your skin cells (under a microscope) in a solu-
tion that contains the allergen to see if your cells break down or change
shape in response to the allergen.
 ELISA/ACT (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) testing consists of
watching how your white blood cells (lymphocytes) react to particular
allergens. Proponents claim that the test can reveal the root cause of 60
percent of all human illnesses.
20
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

 NAET (Nambudripad’s Allergy Elimination Technique) requires you to
hold a food while stretching your arms out akimbo and having the exam-
iner pull down on your arms to test your muscle strength. Supposedly,
you’re allergic to a food if the food weakens you, because the food is
interfering with your energy pathways. Tests results almost always show
the need for acupuncture or acupressure treatments.
 Immune-complex and IgG tests assess common immune reactions not
necessarily related to allergy. IgG tests often identify perfectly harmless
foods as allergens, which can lead to poor diet and malnutrition.
 The pulse test calls for taking your pulse before and after eating a cer-
tain food. If your pulse rate increases significantly, supposedly you’re
either allergic to the food or have an intolerance to it.
21
Chapter 1: Breaking Out with Food Allergies
What qualifies as scientific proof?
Most of the proof that supports the effective-
ness of alternative tests and therapies is in the
form of theories or anecdotal evidence rather
than scientific evidence. “Theory” is simply
another term for “wishful thinking.” Anyone can
concoct a theory that a certain test, for example,
reveals hidden allergens, but if the theory doesn’t
pan out in clinical practice or a controlled test,
it’s bunk. With anecdotal evidence, patients
simply describe how they felt before and after
treatment. This evidence is very open to being
influenced by the placebo effect — the patient’s
belief in the treatment is sufficient in making the
patient think and report that he feels better.
Scientific proof is gathered only through care-
fully controlled studies on people who have
been accurately diagnosed as having a true
food allergy — people who get sick when they
eat a particular food and remain symptom-free
when they avoid that food. A controlled study is
one in which a control group — people or other
animals who do not receive treatment — is
used for comparison purposes.
The accuracy of a study’s results vary depend-
ing on how the researchers run the study. They
may choose from any of the following three test-
ing methods:
 Open: Researchers and patients all know
who’s receiving the treatment and who’s
not. Because everyone is aware of what’s
going on, results may be influenced by the
placebo effect.
 Single-blind: Researchers know who’s
receiving treatment and who’s not, but the
patients don’t. Because the researcher may
unknowingly communicate, through body
language, who’s getting treatment and
who’s not, blind testing may also be influ-
enced by the placebo effect.
 Double-blind: Neither the researchers nor
the patients know who’s receiving treat-
ment and who’s not until after the study is
completed. Results of double-blind testing
are the most reliable.
After a particular treatment is proven effective,
typically in non-human animals, responsible
researchers perform further testing to deter-
mine the treatment’s effectiveness in humans
and its safety. This ensures that mainstream
treatments are safe and effective in humans,
which you can’t always rely on with alternative
treatments.

Pulling the plug on unproven treatments
Many alternative medical practitioners want you to believe that your food
allergies stem from nothing more than your body having too much or too
little of something it needs. They often promise to cure your food allergy and
every other illness you have by bringing your system into “proper balance.”
Following are some of the half-baked schools of thought that drive the devel-
opment of these unproven treatments:
 Homeopathy: A tiny amount of what ails you can supposedly cure you
for good.
 Supplementarians: Peddling their pet concoctions of vitamins, minerals,
and herbs, these folks want you to believe that if your body just had the
right chemical balance, you’d never be sick another day in your life.
 Chelationists: The theory here is that you’ve been poisoned by some-
thing in the environment, typically a heavy metal like lead or mercury.
Leaching the poisons out of your system, through chelation, supposedly
will do the trick.
 Full-body cleansers: These folks attribute almost every disease to a
gummed up colon, liver, kidneys, or gallbladder — nothing a thorough
internal scrubbing can’t cure! 
 Leaky gutters: The leaky gutters do have a point. Sometimes your GI
tract can let some undigested food particles through its walls (a leaky
gut), which may eventually cause a condition called eosinophilic gas-
trointestinal, which I discuss in Chapter 7. Leaky gut, however, plays no
role in food allergies or intolerances.
 Masseuses, chiropractors, and other body manipulators: Although a
good massage, a chiropractic adjustment, or yoga may make you feel
better all around, none of these treatments or practices can cure food
allergies.
The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NC CAM)
Web site at nccam.nih.gov provides some excellent information on alterna-
tive tests and therapies. It’s not comprehensive (for example, when I searched
the site, I found nothing on NAET or ELISA/ACT), but the site does provide
some reliable details about specific herbs, supplements, and other alterna-
tive and complementary treatments. I recommend that you visit the site
before trying any potentially dangerous or utterly useless treatment.
Getting the Lowdown on Potential
Futuristic Cures
Although the medical community has no cure for food allergy, researchers are
working on it. As I reveal in Chapter 9, we’re advancing quickly, and research
22
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

is accelerating at breakneck speed. I predict that within 20 years, we’ll see a
cure for food allergy. The following list introduces some of the most promis-
ing results of current research:
 Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy attempts to desensitize the immune
system to a particular allergen over time by subjecting it to increasing
doses of the allergen.
 Ancient Chinese herbal remedy: An ancient Chinese herbal formula
(FAHF-1) has proven effective in virtually curing peanut allergy in mice.
Another variant of this herbal brew, fondly referred to as FAHF-2 has
proven equally effective in treating mice. For more about FAHF-2, refer to
the following sidebar and skip to Chapter 9.
 Anti-IgE antibody therapy: Because IgE antibodies are the instigators of
most food allergy reactions, scientists are looking for ways to incapaci-
tate these antibodies. Anti-IgE antibody therapy consists of stimulating
the body’s production of IgG antibodies that bind with the IgE antibod-
ies. IgG renders the IgE powerless and unable to trigger the massive
release of histamines, which cause most symptoms.
 Genetically engineered immunization shots: Scientists are working on
ways to re-train the immune system to function properly by ramping up
its response to disease-causing organisms and cranking down its
response to harmless substances. Genetically engineered amino acids
can often tweak the operation of the immune system to mute its reaction
to food allergens.
 Probiotics: Beneficial bacteria, such as those found in yogurt, may opti-
mize the functioning of the immune system, improving its ability to
defend the body against harmful bacteria and viruses while decreasing
its tendency to overreact to food allergens.
23
Chapter 1: Breaking Out with Food Allergies
Improving the ancient Chinese herbal remedy
The results of an NC CAM–sponsored study
sought to test the effectiveness of an ancient
Chinese herbal formula known as FAHF-1 in
reducing allergic reactions to peanut in mice
and possibly preventing the occurrence of life-
threatening reactions. The study proved that the
formula was effective, but it had some signifi-
cant drawbacks. FAHF-1 was:
 A complex formula
 Difficult to produce in mass quantities
 Contained two ingredients that were poten-
tially dangerous
The research team removed the two poten-
tially dangerous ingredients, developing a new,
improved, and simpler formula called FAHF-2.
Test results prove that FAHF-2 is just as effec-
tive in treating peanut allergy in mice, and the
beneficial effects lasted for up to five weeks
after discontinuing treatment.
You can read more about FAHF-2 in Chapter 9.

Living Large with Your Food Allergies
Food allergies limit more than your menu selections. They can place some
restaurants off limits, isolate your allergic child in the cafeteria, make you
more reluctant to visit family and friends for dinner, and complicate your life
with a host of precautionary measures and sometimes paralyzing fear.
Throughout this book, especially in Part III, I attempt to allay any fears and
equip you to deal more effectively with food allergies at home (Chapter 10),
during your evenings out on the town and wherever you happen to travel
(Chapter 11), and at school (Chapters 12 and 13). I reveal common-sense pre-
cautions that, once they become habit, enable you to live a full, enjoyable life
without becoming paralyzed by undo fears. I equip you with everything you
need to decipher labels (Chapter 6), discover tasty alternatives for the foods
you love (Chapter 18), and even whip up a few delicious allergen-free meals
and desserts in your own kitchen (Appendix).
Avoiding the foods you’re allergic to, however, is rarely 100 percent effective
in preventing reactions. The trick to dealing with the possibility of a reaction
is to be prepared 100 percent of the time. By having the medications you
need to immediately respond in the event of an emergency, you can decrease
the fear factor by a factor of ten and establish a more relaxed form of vigi-
lance. (For more about medications and preparing from emergencies, check
out Chapter 7.)
An allergic reaction can be a terrifying experience, but by mastering a few
allergen-avoidance techniques and remaining well-prepared to respond imme-
diately in the event of a reaction, you can limit the risk and ease your mind.
Unmasking Common Food Allergy Myths 
Before you move on to the next chapter or skip ahead to a chapter you find
more fascinating, I’d like to take the opportunity to dispel some of the most
common myths about food allergies. By clearing any cloud of misinformation
from your brain, I can free up some space for the more accurate and useful
information I present later in this book. The following list reveals the most
common and tenacious myths:
 It’s nothing more than a stomachache. Maybe you’re right. Maybe you
have nothing more than a stomachache, but you should still have it
checked out, especially if your stomach aches soon after you eat a 
specific food. Without an accurate diagnosis, you’re at a higher risk of
24
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

experiencing a more severe reaction later and being unprepared to deal
with it, if, in fact, it turns out to be allergy related. 
 A little taste can’t hurt. To your immune system, even a tiny amount of
a problem food is enough to trigger an all-out attack. People with severe
allergies can have life-threatening reactions when the same spatula used
to serve a cookie containing the allergen is used to serve up their sup-
posedly allergen-free cookie. 
 A tiny bit may actually help. Although some food allergy treatments call
for exposing the immune system to increasing amounts of a known aller-
gen to desensitize the immune system, trying to do this on your own is
very dangerous. 
 Food allergies make me hyper. Food allergies are often blamed for psy-
chiatric disorders, such as ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder). Although food may play a role in the severity of the symp-
toms, food allergies are not the root cause or even a strong contributor.
You’re better off seeing a psychiatrist and therapist to receive a proper
diagnosis and treatment.
 Epinephrine is a dangerous drug. Some doctors refuse to prescribe epi-
nephrine, particularly for children, because they think it’s a dangerous
drug. The fact is that epinephrine is a very safe drug, and for a huge
majority of food allergy sufferers, the benefits far outweigh the risks. See
Chapter 7 for details.
 You’re allergic to any food that causes problems. Foods can cause
problems for all sorts of reasons, including other ingredients in the food,
toxins, high concentrations of histamine, bacteria, and viruses. Don’t
assume that just because a particular food gives you the collywobbles
that you’re allergic to that food.
 The peanut allergy is the most common. Peanut may very well be the
most common allergy in some populations, but the prevalence of a par-
ticular food allergy varies according to age and culture. Kids are more
likely to be allergic to peanuts, milk, and eggs, for example, while adults
are more prone to seafood allergies. People of Jewish decent have a
higher prevalence of allergy to sesame. In Japan and other countries in
which fish is a staple, fish allergy is more common.
 If you weren’t allergic to it before, you can’t be allergic to it now. As
explained earlier in this chapter, in the section “Investigating the
Conspiracy: Allergens and Other Contributing Factors,” the onset of a
food allergy is brought on by a genetic susceptibility and exposure to
the problem food. The more exposure to the problem food, the higher
the risk of developing an allergy to it if you’re susceptible. However,
some food allergies, including milk and egg allergies, tend to develop
earlier in life, whereas seafood allergies tend to appear later in life.
25
Chapter 1: Breaking Out with Food Allergies

 Bona fide food allergies are rare. Approximately 7.5 percent of the pop-
ulation of the United States has a bona fide food allergy, and the inci-
dents of food allergies seems to be on the rise.
 I’m allergic to food additives. Food additives can trigger reactions, even
severe reactions, but these are not allergic in nature. Reactions to food
additives are chemical reactions that produce symptoms very similar
and perhaps even identical to those of allergic reactions.

Turning Allergies Inside Out:
Probable Causes and 
Common Symptoms
In This Chapter
 Exploring the food-body connection
 Examining your immune system’s response to allergens
 Investigating the rising prevalence of food allergies
 Assessing the risk of your child acquiring a food allergy
 Spotting the signs and symptoms of typical and atypical reactions
W
hen you experience an allergic reaction to your food, you may
begin to feel as though your food allergy has turned you inside
out. You eat a peanut or sample some mayonnaise, and you break out
in hives or eczema. What kind of sense does that make? If something
you ate made you sick, you’d expect to get queasy or nauseous and
feel your stomach doing somersaults, and that’s often what occurs,
but breaking out in hives? How does that happen?
In this chapter, I get back at food allergies by turning them inside out. I illus-
trate the main culprits in allergenic foods that trigger allergies and show you
how your immune system overreacts when you eat something that you’re
allergic to. I lead you through some population studies to reveal why you may
have developed a food allergy in the first place. Finally, I reveal the symptoms
that are commonly attributed to food allergies and symptoms often falsely
blamed on food allergies. With this information in hand, you can distinguish
fact from fiction when ill-informed practitioners attempt to chalk up all your
ills to the foods you eat.

Finding Out What’s Wrong 
with Your Food
When something you eat makes you sick, your natural impulse is to blame
the food and never eat it again. With food allergies, however, you can’t blame
everything on the food. After all, most people can enjoy the same foods that
make you sick without experiencing even the slightest reaction.
Food allergy is not solely a problem with a particular food. The problem is
your body’s response to that food. Some foods clearly are much more prone
to inducing allergies than others, but the real problem is with the body’s reac-
tion to these foods. 
In the following sections, I reveal the stuff (allergens) in foods that trigger
reactions and investigate other substances in our food supply that are often
mistakenly suspected of triggering reactions or making humans more suscep-
tible to acquiring a food allergy.
Pinpointing problematic proteins
The stuff in some foods that trigger reactions in some people are proteins —
molecules constructed out of building blocks called amino acids. As you
know, proteins are essential in building muscle and repairing cells; they also
play an important role as hormones, enzymes, and antibodies. 
28
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 
The Brazil nut soybean debacle
In the early days of genetically engineered
foods, scientists were looking for a way to make
a soy plant more resistant to disease. In doing
so, they inserted genetic material from Brazil
nuts into these super-duper soy plants. Turns
out that the component of Brazil nut that they
inserted contained the nut allergen that triggers
reactions in people with tree nut allergy. The
resulting soybean plant could have resulted in
producing several species of soybeans that
could be deadly to people with tree nut 
allergies.
This plant was quickly removed from develop-
ment, and the government took steps to screen
all future genetically engineered foods for their
allergic potential. Although these safety mea-
sures are not foolproof, they have provided a
substantial element of safety. 

Every protein has a unique, genetically mapped structure. You probably
couldn’t discern one protein from another in a police lineup, but your
immune system has an eagle eye for identifying proteins. Within seconds
after a specific protein enters your system, your immune system identifies it
as friend or foe. When your immune system mistakenly identifies a food pro-
tein as an enemy invader, it jumps into attack mode and causes all the symp-
toms that make you miserable — hives, rash, nausea, breathing difficulties,
and so on.
What is it about a particular protein that makes it problematic? Researchers
continue to study that question, but most suspect that problematic proteins
are high-profile molecules that the immune system can easily spot. Problematic
proteins commonly exhibit the following traits:
 Unique shape or folding pattern: Peanut proteins, for example, are
folded with the protein pieces that are responsible for stimulating the
immune system exposed rather than concealed inside the molecule.
 Size: Protein molecules that trigger allergic reactions tend to be rather
large . . . comparatively speaking, of course.
 Stability: Allergenic proteins may be more stable, requiring additional
time for your system to break them down into innocuous amino acids.
Separating logic from lore
Nature abhors a vacuum, and so does the human mind. When people are
unaware of the protein-immune-system connection, they concoct all sorts of
theories about what actually causes food allergies. Some of these theories are
valid to certain point, others rarely apply, and a few are just plain bunk. In the
following sections, I separate logic from lore to paint a clearer picture of what
really causes food allergies and reactions and what doesn’t.
Fooling Mother Nature (and your immune system) 
with genetically engineered foods
Can genetically engineered foods trigger allergies? They sure can, although
the occurrences are rare. To genetically engineer a food, scientists introduce
genetic material from one food into another. If they mistakenly introduce an
allergenic protein from one food into another, the receiving food also con-
tains the allergenic protein, which can also trigger a reaction, (see the side-
bar, “the Brazil nut–soybean debacle,” to find out about a case in which this
actually happened).

Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms

Putting the heat on histamines 
During an allergic reaction, your immune system produces histamines that 
trigger symptoms, so it stands to reason that consuming histamines would trig-
ger similar symptoms, and consuming histamines sometimes does just that.
Several foods contain histamine or histamine-like substances of their own:
 Scombroid fish: The Scombridae family of fish, including tunas and
mackerels and their close cousins, bluefish and mahi-mahi, contain a
toxic histamine generated by bacterial degradation of substances in the
muscle protein. This natural spoilage process is thought to release addi-
tional by-products that intensify the toxic effect and can cause scom-
broid poisoning.
 Strawberries: People who have “allergic reactions” to strawberries are
often simply more sensitive to the histamines they contain.
 Tomatoes: When tomatoes produce symptoms similar to those of an
allergic reaction, histamines may be to blame.
 Chocolate: A food allergy to chocolate is rare, but chocolate may con-
tain higher levels of histamines that can trigger allergic-like symptoms.
 Wine and beer: Some wines and beers contain elevated levels of hista-
mines. Wine producers have picked up on this and some now offer 
histamine-low or histamine-free wine. Red wines typically contain more
histamines than white wines.
The levels of histamine present in these foods are usually not capable of
causing reactions but they can and occasionally do cause allergic-like reac-
tions. Scombroid poisoning can cause severe reactions, but reactions to
other foods that contain elevated histamine levels are typically mild, if they
even occur.
Accusing food additives 
Most processed foods contain additives including dyes, preservatives, and a
variety of other chemicals to make foods more stable, prettier, or tastier. If
you experience reactions consuming foods that contain a particular additive,
the food itself is not at fault, and you’re not really experiencing a true food
allergy. You’re allergic to the stuff in or on the food. Here are the two most
common culprits:
 Sulfites: Sulfites can cause severe reactions in people who are sensitive
to them. Asthma sufferers generally face a higher risk. Food manufactur-
ers often add sulfite to wines, some baked goods, and even on fruits and
vegetables to keep them fresh. Strict labeling laws are in place for sul-
fites, because even low levels can cause severe reactions in some
people.
30
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

 MSG (monosodium glutamate): MSG is another food additive that occa-
sionally causes adverse reactions. Because Chinese foods commonly
contain high levels of MSG, reactions it causes are often referred to as
“the Chinese restaurant syndrome.” Headache and flushing are the most
common symptoms, but sweating, increased heart rate, and anxiety can
also occur.
Reactions to other food additives are relatively uncommon. They do occur,
especially to food dyes, but a history of such a reaction is usually not borne
out by a full evaluation. Many people believe that they have reacted to a dye
or preservative, but on closer inspection allergists find that the patient is
actually eating the same substance in high concentrations in many other
foods without experiencing any reaction. Allergists have no allergy tests for
most of these dyes and preservatives. Health history and challenge testing
are the best diagnostic tools currently available.

Joe’s Alleve and pink champagne story
In 1994, my wife attended the inaugural
Brickyard 400 auto race at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway with her sister and brother-in-
law. My wife was driving a separate car, and
they all planned on meeting at the track. Not a
big race fan myself, I volunteered to stay home
with the kids. When the race was over, I was
pretty worn out and had a terrible headache
from a full day with my 8- and 5-year-olds, so I
popped an Alleve and washed it down with a
couple gulps of pink champagne.
Minutes later, my entire body started to itch, and
I had no idea what was happening. My sister-
in-law called to say that she and her husband
were going to drop by on their way home.
Feeling terrible, I told her to just go on — I had
had a long day. She said they were coming over
anyway.
When they arrived, I was a wreck. My body was
covered with hives, my ears had swelled up to
the size of oven mitts, and my lips were swollen
into a curved smile that made me look like the
Joker on Batman. My sister-in-law called my
neighbor, a nurse who lived in the house behind
ours. She instructed me to take some Benedryl
and sit in a cold bath until she arrived. My poor
brother-in-law was assigned the task of keep-
ing my naked body covered with cold, wet
towels.
As soon as my neighbor saw my face, she
instructed us to head to the hospital. My wife
arrived, and then she, my sister-in-law, and my
neighbor drove me to the emergency room
where the nurse on staff gave me a shot of epi-
nephrine and hooked me up to an IV. I felt imme-
diate relief. 
The doctor came in to talk with me a little later.
When he saw me with three women and heard
my story about the Alleve and the pink cham-
pagne, he smirked and asked, “So which one of
you is his wife?” After the laughter died down,
he followed up with, “And what exactly were
you celebrating?”

Investigating other manufactured-chemical troublemakers
Chemical engineers have designed a wide variety of products to improve our
lives — everything from pain relievers to zero-calorie artificial sweeteners.
But some bodies haven’t evolved to assimilate this stuff. 
Any of hundreds of manufactured chemicals can trigger allergic-like reac-
tions, but one of the most common classes that cause problems are NSAIDs
(Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs). Pain relievers including aspirin,
Motrin, Advil, and Alleve are known as NSAIDs. These pain relievers are great
for treating headaches and pain in most people, but they can cause severe
reactions in some. My co-author, Joe, experienced a severe reaction to Alleve
that he accounts in the following sidebar.
Manufactured chemicals can’t be considered foods, so reactions to them are
not considered the result of food allergies. The medical community attributes
reactions to these substances to chemical sensitivities.
Mistaking food intolerances for food allergies
When a food makes you sick, you may be inclined to blame it on a food
allergy, but foods can make you ill for other reasons — the most common of
which is that you have an intolerance of the food. With a food intolerance,
symptoms occur because your body has trouble digesting or breaking down
the problem food. 
The classic example of a food intolerance is lactose intolerance, in which
people experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea because
they’re unable to break down the milk sugar called lactose. Lactose intoler-
ance is completely different from milk allergy in which the immune system
has developed a sensitivity to milk protein. 
Examining nature’s poisons and their purpose
If you try to eat a lion, the lion fights back. Although inanimate edibles can’t
claw your eyes out, they often contain toxins that protect them from preda-
tors or simply exist as part of the plant’s chemistry. Almonds, for example,
contain cyanide. Fruits commonly have a laxative effect on animals, to enable
any seeds that an animal swallows to quickly move through their digestive
track, so the seeds are not damaged. Other foods contain chemicals to ward
off bacteria and fungus infection.
Some toxins in foods can be quite deadly. Mushroom hunters, for example,
have to be able to tell a poisonous mushroom from one that’s harmless,
because some mushrooms can be deadly. Several varieties of fish also pro-
duce their own toxins. One of the most well known is the puffer fish, which
can contain a potent toxin.
Natural toxins in foods can make you ill, but your illness from those toxins
has nothing to do with food allergies.

Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Finding Out What’s Wrong with You
A food allergy is not just difficulty digesting a food but rather the immune
system’s overreaction to a specific food that sparks a reaction. The actual
reaction that produces symptoms involves a complex sequence of events
that I describe in the following sections.
Although food allergies can arise at any stage in life, the vast majority have
their onset in childhood, particularly in the first one to two years.
Going wild: Immune systems gone wild
A virgin immune system has no reason to launch an all-out attack on a harm-
less food. It has to be properly sensitized to the food first (through an initial
exposure). Sensitization is the process by which the immune system starts
producing antibodies to a food that causes the immune system to overreact
the next time it’s exposed to that food.
The mechanics of exactly what happens to trigger the first reaction can be
somewhat complicated. In the following sections, I provide a brief overview
of how sensitization leads to future reactions and how the resulting antibod-
ies react when a problem food is reintroduced.
From sensitization to all-out mayhem
A food allergy is an immune system response to a food that the body mistak-
enly believes is harmful. Here’s a blow-by-blow description of what occurs
during a typical reaction:
33
Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms
Paying the price for eating high on the food chain
Some toxins, such as mercury in fish, become
more of a problem the higher up you eat on the
food chain. Eating lower on the food chain is
thought by some to reduce the risk. Eating
smaller fish, for example, such as sardines and
anchovies (if you can stomach them), rather
than larger fish, such as tuna and swordfish,
may help you limit your consumption of specific
toxins.
But not all toxins move up the food chain, and if
you’re eating a relatively balanced and varied
diet, the amount of toxins you’re ingesting is typ-
ically not much of a problem, and they’re cer-
tainly not related to food allergies.

1. Once the immune system decides that a particular food is harmful, it
creates specific IgE (Immunoglobulin E) antibodies to it. The following
section introduces you to IgE.
2. The next time the individual eats that food, the immune system releases
massive amounts of chemicals, including histamine, as shown in 
Figure 2-1. 
3. These chemicals trigger a cascade of allergic symptoms that can affect
the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, or cardiovascular
system.

Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Although most food allergies are caused by these IgE antibodies, some do not
involve IgE but rather other parts of the immune system. These are particu-
larly common with some of the food allergies that affect the gastrointestinal
tract and are referred to as non-IgE-mediated food allergies. 
IgE antibodies and the foods they hate
Your immune system produces four main classes of antibodies produced —
IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE. The first three types serve to fight infection and are
critical to our health. The purpose of IgE is to fight infection, specifically par-
asitic infections. These IgE antibodies, however, also cause allergic reactions.
As parasitic infections have become less common in the developed world, 
IgE can devote more and more of its energy toward allergy. Here’s a quick
overview of how IgE comes into play: 
1. Once IgE is produced, it sits on the surface of the main allergy cells of
the body called the mast cells and basophils. 
2. The IgE that your body produces is specific for one allergen or another,
and when that specific allergen reenters the body, it finds the IgE sitting
on the surface of the cells. 
3. Once the allergen finds the IgE, the immune system triggers the release
of histamine and other chemicals that cause allergic symptoms. 
The same process occurs with environmental allergens that cause hay fever
and other conditions. 
Debating the nature or nurture question 
What causes you to develop an allergy in the first place? Is it your genetic
makeup? Something in our food supply? Something you ate too much of as a
kid? A great deal of research has been devoted to answering these questions,
and the best answer that researchers have developed so far is that food aller-
gies are caused by a combination of nature (your genes) and nurture (what
you eat). The best evidence available for a genetic connection comes from
studies of peanut allergy in twins (see the sidebar “Discovering the genetic
connection through peanut studies on twins”).
The medical community knows that allergies run in families, so the genetic
link is well established, but we also know that children in the same families —
even twins — do not always share the same allergies. This has led
researchers to suspect that genes account only for a susceptibility to food
allergies. If parents have hay fever or asthma, for example, their children are
more prone to developing an allergic disease, including hay fever, asthma,
eczema, or food allergy. One child may develop food allergy, another may
develop hay fever, and a third may be allergy-free. Why this happens is still
largely a mystery. 
35
Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms

Triggering allergies through exposure
A genetic predisposition to a food allergy is like a genetic predisposition to
bruising. Even if you bruise easily, you won’t get a bruise unless you get
whacked with something. With food allergy, you’re highly unlikely to develop
an allergy unless you’re predisposed to react to a particular allergen and then
exposed to that allergen. This sensitizes your immune system to the allergen,
making you susceptible to future reactions. 
The formula that causes the onset of a food allergy is well known: 
Genetic Predisposition + Exposure = Sensitization
After your immune system is sensitized to a particular allergen, exposure to
that allergen potentially leads to symptoms, as shown in Figure 2-2. 
The exposure piece of the equation gets pretty complicated. For those who
are predisposed to developing a food allergy, the type of exposure may influ-
ence the likelihood that the exposure triggers onset, as the following general
tendencies reveal: 
 Repeated low-dose exposure to an allergen early in life is most likely
to sensitize you to a specific allergen. In other words, you’re more
likely to develop a food allergy to an allergen that repeatedly enters your
system in small amounts, such as in breast feeding, trace amounts in
foods, or even incidental contact. 
36
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 
Discovering the genetic connection 
through peanut studies on twins
Studies of peanut allergy in twins have provided
the strongest proof that genes play a role in
developing food allergy but are not exclusively
responsible. An important study shows that an
identical twin has a 64 percent chance of shar-
ing a peanut allergy with the twin sibling who is
allergic to peanut. With nonidentical twins the
risk drops to a mere 7 percent. 
The study clearly demonstrates a strong genetic
link to peanut allergy but also proves that food
allergy is not purely a genetic disease. What
leads one of the identical twins to develop the
allergy and spares the second is unknown.
Allergy specialists believe that exposure plays
a role in developing a food allergy, but deter-
mining exactly what each twin is exposed to in
the uncontrolled testing environment of daily
living is nearly impossible.

 Large-dose exposures early in life may make you less likely to develop
a food allergy. Odd, but true — increased exposure to an allergen may
actually make you less sensitive to that food. Hold on. Don’t start feeing
your baby peanut-based formula or advising nursing mothers to gobble
up more peanuts. At this point, doctors have no reliable way to imple-
ment this observation in a preventive treatment plan. Based on the best
information currently available, the recommendation is still to avoid
peanut and other common allergens early in life.
 Avoidance diets may or may not help ward off the development of a
food allergy. Although my colleagues and I recommend that parents
limit exposure to common food allergens early in their children’s lives,
research results waffle on the conclusion. While some studies show that
avoidance diets early in life ward off the onset of food allergies, others
have failed to uphold these results. We commonly see children who are
born into allergic families where exposure has been virtually or com-
pletely eliminated develop the allergy. The mother may never have eaten
peanut during pregnancy or breast feeding, all peanut has been banned
from the premises, and incidental contact is highly unlikely, but the
child still develops a peanut allergy. My belief is that these children are
so genetically prone to developing the allergy that even inhaling a few
errant molecules of peanut protein in the grocery store or shopping mall
may be enough to trigger the sensitization process.

Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms

Exploring the Sudden Rise 
in Food Allergies
If you grew up in the ’60s or ’70s, you may never have heard the term “food
allergy.” Your classmates and playmates probably were able to eat whatever
they wanted free from the fear of a reaction. Perhaps your entire school had
only one or two kids with food allergies if your school even had a kid with
food allergies.
Over the last 20 years, however, the prevalence of food allergy appears 
to have risen sharply. Researchers can’t pin an absolute number on the
increase, because no reliable comparative data over the 20-year period is
available — studies being performed today follow different procedures from
those performed 20 years ago, so you can’t really compare the numbers.
Allergists do, however, have plenty of evidence that points to a dramatic
increase in food allergy:
 Evidence gathered over the last 10 years using the same methods show
that the prevalence of peanut allergy has doubled in the last 5–10 years.
 Anecdotal and clinical evidence shows a significant increase in food
allergy. Pediatricians tell me that they see far more food allergy than
ever before. School nurses report that while a decade ago they had one
or two children in the school with epinephrine prescriptions, they now
have 20 or 30. Some of this could be due to what we refer to as a detec-
tion bias; that is, increasing awareness about a problem leads to its
being diagnosed more efficiently. However, most experts believe that 
the increase is real and not simply the result of increased awareness.
 Reliable asthma studies show at least a 100 percent increase in the preva-
lence of asthma (an allergy-related disease) over the last 30 years. The
rise in asthma appears to have preceded the rise in food allergy (which is
a source of confusion) although experts believe that similar mechanisms
likely underlie the dramatic increases in all allergic diseases. 
The jump in all allergic diseases across the board suggests that a collection
of contributing factors not present 20 or 30 years ago is responsible.
Researchers have presented many theories to explain the increase, but the
only clear conclusion is that no one, single cause can explain it.
Examining the hygiene hypothesis
When you’re growing up, adults, whom you assume know what’s good for 
you tell you to practice proper hygiene. By the time you’re six years old, the
phrases “Wash your hands,” “Brush your teeth,” “Don’t let the dog lick your
face,” and “Stay out of the mud,” play like Zen mantras in your head.
38
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Perhaps our obsession with cleanliness is at the root of the increase in aller-
gies. This theory, referred to as the hygiene hypothesis, is the most popular
explanation for the rise in allergies. Simply stated, the hygiene hypothesis
proposes that the less the immune system is exposed to germs and bacterial
by-products the more energy it has to unleash on allergens. If this sounds
kooky to you, examine the evidence before dismissing this theory:
 Allergies are much more common in developed countries, and the preva-
lence in allergies rises pretty much in direct proportion to the rise in
development.
 Allergies are less common in children who grow up on farms, who attend
daycare in early life, and who have multiple older siblings. 
 Allergies may be less common in families that have pets, perhaps
because pets increase exposure to bacteria and bacterial by-products.
Before you move out to the country, surround your family with livestock, and
start rolling around in the pig pen, realize that the hygiene hypothesis has
some holes in it, suggesting that other factors may play a role. The inner-city
environment, for example, defies the hygiene hypothesis. Children growing up
in the inner-city should reap all the benefits of poor hygiene in warding off the
onset of allergies, but inner-city kids have some of the highest rates of asthma
and allergy anywhere. This suggests that other factors, such as air pollution or
environmental allergen exposure, may trump the hygiene hypothesis. 
Investigating other possible suspects 
When you consider all the new developments in foods, medications, and
other substances introduced into our lives over the past 30 years, you can
easily become suspicious of numerous items that may have influenced the
rise in food allergies. In the following list, I name several of the top suspects
and provide my professional opinion on just how likely they contribute to the
upward trend:
 Vitamins: One study suggests that vitamin supplements may promote
allergy. Another study suggests that vitamin deficiency, especially vita-
min D, may promote allergy. Conclusion? We just don’t know yet.
 Antacids: Some evidence shows that antacids or other medicines
designed to suppress stomach acids may promote allergy. This makes
sense, because these products may reduce the breakdown of allergenic
proteins in the stomach. The jury’s still out on this one.
 Immunizations or antibiotics: No evidence at this time provides reliable
evidence that immunizations or antibiotics promote allergy development.
39
Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms

 Tobacco smoke: Of all the studies ever done, the only factor that con-
sistently has been associated with increases in allergy is exposure to
tobacco smoke. The first studies in this regard looked at childhood
asthma, and nobody was surprised to learn that exposure to tobacco
smoke may lead to an increased susceptibility to asthma. This was pre-
sumed to be due to tobacco smoke’s irritating effects on the airways.
Research has now shown that exposure to tobacco smoke actually stim-
ulates the immune system to promote the development of allergy. Other
air pollutants may also play a role, although most studies have shown
that exposure to air pollution has relatively little effect on the develop-
ment of allergy. 
Gauging Your Child’s Risk for Developing
a Food Allergy 
Families frequently ask my colleagues and me to estimate the risk that their
next child will develop food allergy. These are typically families who already
have at least one child with food allergy, so the odds may already be tipped
against them. Although we’re reasonably good at predicting the chance of
developing some form of allergic disease, our track record for specifically
predicting food allergy is less impressive. 
In the following sections I present data that can assist you in guesstimating
the odds that your next child will develop some sort of allergic disease —
based on family history and gender. I then investigate the role that age plays
in the onset of an allergy-related condition.
Following the guidelines
You can use the following guidelines and the graph shown in Figure 2-3 to for-
mulate your own prediction:
 If both you and your mate have an allergic disease, your children have a
40–60 percent chance of developing some form of allergic disease, not
necessarily food allergy.
 If only you or your mate has an allergic disease, the likelihood drops to
30–40 percent.
 I would estimate that in the most allergic families that already have one
or two children with a food allergy, the odds are less than 20–25 percent
40
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

that the next child will also have food allergy. The next child is almost
guaranteed to have some form of allergic disease but not necessarily
food allergy. 
 All allergies, including food allergies are about twice as common in boys
as girls. This evens out later in childhood, and then, by adulthood,
asthma and allergies are more common in women. 
See Chapter 1 for details on preventing the onset of food allergies.
In a family with several members who have food allergy, the likelihood of the
next child being allergic is highly probable, but whether the allergy takes the
form of food allergy is impossible to predict.  
Weighing the age factor 
The age factor carries a lot of weight in determining the onset of allergies.
The vast majority of allergies develop early in life. Food allergy hits its peak
prevalence at one year of age, and at least 80 percent of childhood food aller-
gies are likely to develop by the age of one. 
Why are young children so much more susceptible to developing a food
allergy? Because the intestinal tract of the infant provides a less complete

Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms

barrier against allergenic proteins, so as proteins escape the intestinal tract,
they become high-profile targets for the body’s immune system. This barrier
slowly closes by about six months of age. The only problem with this theory
is that allergies very commonly worsen over the first two to three years of
life, even if a child is destined to outgrow them later. A one-year-old who’s
allergic to milk or egg, for example, is likely to develop a more severe allergy
by the time they are two to three, even if they eventually outgrow the allergy. 
A few allergies defy this rule and tend to crop up more frequently in later
years. 
 Shellfish and fish: Allergies to shellfish and sometimes fish most often
develop later in life. 
 Fruits and vegetables: Allergies to fruits and vegetables may arise later
in life as a secondary allergy related to a pollen allergy that you acquired
earlier in your life. Allergies to fruits and vegetables often don’t get into
full swing until your pollen allergies have become sufficiently strong to
spill over and cause a food allergy. Reactions to fruits and vegetables
typically result in oral allergy syndrome covered in detail in Chapter 7. 
Exploring Common Signs and Symptoms
Food allergy may present with a wide array of signs and symptoms. (The term
present is doctor lingo for how a condition shows up in your body.) Food
reactions typically involve the following three major organ systems in your
body along with a fourth system that plays a role in severe reactions:
 Skin, such as hives or eczema
 Gastrointestinal tract, including nausea, stomach upset, and diarrhea
 Respiratory tract, including rhinitis (sneezing, runny nose) and difficulty
breathing (or asthma)
 Cardiovascular system, sometimes involved in severe reactions (see the
section “Uncovering anaphylaxis: The shocking story,” later in this chap-
ter for more information)
Some reactions are isolated to a single system, such as hives on the skin,
while others may involve multiple systems, as sometimes occurs in an ana-
phylactic reaction. This myriad of presentations is one of the many reasons
why some food allergies are so difficult to diagnose. In the following sections,
I bring you up to speed on the most common symptoms, introduce some rare
symptoms, and deliver several tips on how to rule out symptoms unrelated
to (but often mistaken for) food allergy.
42
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Getting under your skin
A food allergy can literally get under your skin. Skin reactions are the most
common manifestations of food allergy. Symptoms, such as hives, may occur
very acutely or as a much more chronic, low-grade condition. In the following
sections I give you the skinny on the most common cutaneous (a fancy doctor
term for skin) manifestations of food allergy. 
Itching with eczema (atopic dermatitis)
Eczema (or atopic dermatitis) is a chronic skin condition characterized by
extreme dryness and itchiness. It typically begins early in life and hits its
peak prevalence at about one year of age. At that point, 15 to 20 percent of 
all one-year-olds have some degree of eczema, ranging from extremely mild 
to involving only tiny areas of skin to extremely severe cases involving the
entire body. 
Tracing eczema back to a food allergy requires some savvy detective work for
various reasons.
 Eczema may not involve food allergy. Your doctor may not even suspect
food allergy as the cause. Other factors that can contribute to eczema’s
onset and severity include
• Genetic susceptibility
• Heat
• Humidity
• Certain types of clothing
• Soaps or detergents
 Food reactions that trigger eczema are typically low-grade and difficult
to identify. 
 Reactions may be delayed by several hours.
 Symptoms can wax and wane over time, due to temperature, humidity,
and environmental irritants.
 Foods that typically trigger eczema are common foods eaten on a very
regular basis. If you drink milk or eat wheat several times a day, detect-
ing any clear connection between a specific food and your eczema symp-
toms can be nearly impossible. 
Based on a large number of studies, we know that food allergy is at the root
of about 40 percent of all cases of children with moderate to severe eczema.
This means that at least 50 percent of children with eczema, including some
43
Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms

with severe eczema, do not have food allergy. For the remainder, however,
identifying the underlying food allergy and restricting the allergenic foods
often leads to a marked improvement in symptoms. And given that eczema is
an extraordinarily uncomfortable condition due to the severe itching that it
creates, anything that makes you more comfortable is of extreme value. 
When food allergy is involved in eczema, the five most common food aller-
gens are the prime suspects — egg, milk, peanut, soy, and wheat. Other foods
can certainly be involved, but these top five are the most important to
remember. In fact, if a child with eczema tests negative to these five foods by
either skin testing or blood testing, the likelihood of any food allergy is
extremely low. 
Once you and your doctor have accomplished the daunting task of tracing
your eczema to a food allergy, you can find symptomatic relief in Chapter 7.
Scratching the surface with hives
Hives (also known as urticaria) are itchy, raised splotches on the surface of
your skin. About 20 times itchier than a mosquito bite, hives make you want
to tear off your clothes and then your skin. When most folks have their first
encounter with hives, they assume the condition is caused by something
they ate. In most cases, however, hives are the result of other conditions:
 Viral illness: In many cases, a viral illness can trigger an outbreak of hives.
 Anxiety: When some people get real nervous, they get hives. This condi-
tion is called cholinergic urticaria.
 Heat or Cold: Cholinergic urticaria can also result from an increase in a
person’s core body temperature or other temperature extremes. Some
people can’t even perform their normal exercise routine without break-
ing out in hives.
 Vibration: Any vibration against the surface of the skin, even from 
clothing rubbing against it, can trigger a bout of hives in those prone to
cholinergic urticaria. This is rare, indeed. In fact, I’ve never seen a case
of vibratory urticaria.
 Chemical reaction: A reaction to penicillin or other medications can
cause hives.
If you haven’t eaten anything remotely suspicious in the few hours before
experiencing hives, you can safely assume that your hives have nothing to do
with a food allergy. Determining the cause of a random outbreak is usually
impossible. 
If, however, hives occur shortly after eating a new food, food allergy could cer-
tainly be the cause, especially if you just ate one of the more highly allergenic
foods. A typical scenario is a baby who develops hives after his first taste of
yogurt or scrambled eggs or peanut butter. When hives are due to food allergy
44
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

they typically occur almost immediately (within 30 minutes) after eating the
food and rarely beyond four hours after eating a suspicious food. If you ate
shrimp on Saturday and got hives on Monday, it’s not the shrimp.
A case of hives is not, in itself, serious, but it may be a sign of something more
serious now or in the future. Keep the following important points in mind:
 Hives accompanied by other symptoms including vomiting or restricted
breathing may be a sign of the onset of a severe allergic reaction. The
more different parts of your body that are involved in a food reaction,
the more dangerous it may be. 
 A mild outbreak of hives can indicate the possibility of more severe
allergic reactions in the future. This doesn’t guarantee that your next
reaction will be worse, but you should certainly be prepared for that
possibility. When I teach doctors about food allergy, I always tell them
that just because that first reaction caused only hives, you have no guar-
antee that a future reaction will not be more severe.
If you’re experiencing repeated bouts of hives and are unsure of the reason,
try keeping a food diary for a week or two to see if you can trace your recur-
ring hives to a specific food. While you’re logging your encounters with hives,
consult your doctor and draw up an emergency plan just in case your next
reaction is more severe.
Digging deeper with angioedema
Angioedema means swelling. Although it may occur alone, it most often
accompanies hives. In fact, many doctors think of angioedema as hives to 
the nth degree, although hives tend to be more localized. During a reaction,
angioedema can produce a wide range of symptoms:
 Welts, particularly on the face and around the eyes.
 Swollen lips.
 Intestinal swelling, often resulting in painful stomachache.
 Restricted or obstructed breathing, due to swelling of the airway. This is
the most serious manifestation of angioedema, because the swelling can
completely block the airway. Keep in mind that your windpipe is less
than an inch in diameter and considerably narrower in children — a little
swelling can easily pinch it shut. Angioedema’s ability to obstruct breath-
ing is the most common cause of life-threatening and fatal food reactions. 
Patients often wonder if having angioedema externally, such as a swollen eye,
indicates some internal swelling that they can’t observe. External swelling
can occur without internal swelling, but even so, when you observe signifi-
cant external swelling, you need to be concerned about the possibility of
swelling in the airway.
45
Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms

Taking a breather: Respiratory reactions
Food reactions can involve the airway anywhere from the tip of the nose to
the bottom of the lungs, resulting in any or all the following symptoms:
 Nasal congestion or runny nose.
 Swelling of the throat or airway, as described in the previous section.
 Swelling of the bronchial tubes and even smaller airways in the lungs.
When this occurs, the asthma-like symptoms occur as a result of a com-
bination of airway swelling, muscle constriction, and mucus production.
Asthmatic patients are much more likely to have these lower respiratory
difficulties as part of a food reaction. In fact, patients with asthma are at
far greater risk of having life-threatening or fatal allergic reactions
because of this lower airway component. 
When the lower airway — the throat and lungs — is involved in an allergic
reaction, immediate administration of epinephrine is critical. Antihistamines
have virtually no effect on these reactions. Asthma medications may be effec-
tive or completely useless, so don’t rely on them. Epinephrine is king. See
Chapter 7 to find out more about medications and emergency procedures.
Although acute food reactions often involve the respiratory tract, chronic
congestion and other chronic respiratory conditions, such as asthma, are
rarely the work of a food allergy. So, if you have chronic nasal congestion or
asthma, without other food allergy symptoms, such as hives, eczema, or
intestinal problems, your doctor is unlikely to suspect or test for food allergy
as a cause. Environmental allergies become the prime suspect in these cases.
Check out Asthma For Dummies (Wiley) for more information on asthma.
Having a gut reaction . . . literally
The most obvious victim of a food reaction is your gastrointestinal (GI) track —
your digestive system, which starts in your mouth and ends in the waste canal.
Because this system processes everything you eat and drink, you’d suspect it
to suffer during a food allergy reaction, and it often suffers plenty. 
Like skin reactions, GI reactions may range from very acute to very chronic,
as the following sections describe. For details on treating specific gastroin-
testinal disorders, check out Chapter 7.
Observing acute gastrointestinal symptoms
Acute food reactions that attack the GI tract typically occur within moments
after eating the offending food, and often produce the following symptoms:
46
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

 Itching in the mouth
 Swelling of the tongue
 Nausea
 Vomiting
 Abdominal pain
 Diarrhea (sometimes) 
Although these symptoms can occur alone, they’re often accompanied by
other symptoms, such as hives and angioedema. 
Taking note of more chronic gastrointestinal symptoms
Chronic gastrointestinal symptoms behave much more like eczema — these
symptoms indicate a more delayed and lower-grade reaction than in acute
cases. Symptoms include the following:
 Gastroesophageal reflux. In infants with reflux, food allergy plays a role
in up to one-third of cases and may be the sole cause of the reflux. In
infants who can’t seem to hold down their food, doctors should at least
consider the possibility of food allergy. Food allergy is less likely in older
children, adolescents, or adults with reflux, although it certainly occurs
occasionally and should not be overlooked.
 Persistent abdominal pain. A chronic stomachache can be the sign of a
food allergy. Of course, it can also be a sign of eating too much junk food.
Have it checked out.
 Weight-loss and poor growth in children. These are usually related con-
ditions that arise as a result of chronic gastrointestinal reactions, because
patients may be eating less and be unable to fully absorb nutrients due to
chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. 
 Constipation. Although food allergy can cause constipation, it’s not
common. If you have a difficult case of constipation that doesn’t respond
to other treatments or your constipation is accompanied by other food
allergy symptoms, such as hives or eczema, you may want to be tested
for food allergy. Otherwise, the cause is probably something else.
Uncovering anaphylaxis: 
The shocking story
Anaphylaxis (often called anaphylactic shock, but I’ll get to that later) is an
allergic reaction that involves multiple organ systems. If you experience symp-
toms in any two or more of the following organ systems, you’re experiencing
anaphylaxis:
47
Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms

 Skin: The most common symptoms of anaphylaxis are urticaria (hives)
and angioedema (swelling of the tissues under the skin), but these symp-
toms are absent in up to 20 percent of anaphylactic reactions. 
 Respiratory tract: Respiratory symptoms occur in about 50 percent of
people who have anaphylaxis and are especially common in people who
also have asthma. Low blood pressure can cause lightheadedness, dizzi-
ness, tunnel vision, and loss of consciousness (passing out).
 Gastrointestinal tract: Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 30 percent of
people. 
 Cardiovascular system: Anaphylactic shock (extremely low blood pres-
sure) occurs less commonly but may be increasingly common with age,
occurring in up to 30 percent of adults who have a reaction. (See “Taking
the pulse of cardiovascular symptoms,” later in this chapter for details
on cardiovascular symptoms.)
Anaphylaxis isn’t always anaphylactic shock. In medical circles, shock refers to
a drop in blood pressure to a dangerously low level. You can experience ana-
phylaxis with or without the shock (the dangerous drop in blood pressure).
In the following sections, I reveal the various ways that anaphylaxis attacks,
explore the potentially dangerous cardiovascular symptoms that may be pre-
sent, and describe the factors that increase a person’s odds of experiencing
anaphylaxis. 
Exploring how anaphylaxis attacks
Anaphylaxis typically unfolds according to one of the following three scenarios: 
 Uniphasic: A single wave of symptoms. 
 Biphasic: In about a third of the cases, the reaction appears to resolve
but recurs one to eight hours later. 
 Protracted: Rarely, a pattern referred to as protracted anaphylaxis occurs,
with signs and symptoms persisting for up to 48 hours despite treatment.
Thankfully, not all anaphylaxis is severe and life-threatening. Some reactions
even resolve on their own without treatment, but that’s impossible to predict,
so you must treat all anaphylactic reactions promptly with epinephrine. See
Chapter 7 for a comprehensive approach for treating anaphylaxis. 
Taking the pulse of cardiovascular symptoms
Whenever the core of your being — your heart and all the pipelines through
which it pumps your blood — is involved in a reaction, all sorts of really bad
stuff can happen, and it can happen in a hurry: 
48
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

 Hypotension: Hypotension (a drop in blood pressure) is the most
common symptom. When your blood pressure drops, you often get
dizzy, feel lightheaded, and sometimes pass out. An extreme drop in
blood pressure results in anaphylactic shock.
 Heart arrhythmia: A heart arrhythmia is a variation in the beating of
your heart — beating too fast, too slow, or irregularly.
 Heart attack: A severe food allergy reaction can give you a heart attack.
In children and young adults, anaphylactic shock is relatively uncommon
even with the most severe reactions, because their cardiovascular system is
so resilient. This does not mean, however, that younger people are immune
to severe anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis in younger people typically results in
breathing difficulty — a constricted or blocked airway that causes the fatal
and near fatal reaction. In a fatal reaction, the heart stops only because the
body eventually runs out of oxygen.
Exploring the risk factors
Anyone who has food allergies should remain on the lookout for the signs
and symptoms that presage a severe reaction, but some people may need to
remain more vigilant than others. The following factors contribute to increas-
ing your risk for experiencing a severe or fatal anaphylactic reaction.
 Naming the high-risk foods: While any food allergen can cause anaphy-
laxis, a few are particularly skilled at doing so. The most sinister of the
bunch are peanuts, tree nuts, sesame, and shellfish. Peanuts and tree
nuts alone are responsible for 80–90 percent of all fatal reactions. Other
foods, including milk, egg, and wheat can cause severe reactions, as
well. In fact, I see many patients with reactions to these foods that are
just as severe as the worst peanut reactions. The reality though is that
while most people with peanut and tree nut allergy are at risk for severe
reactions, a far lesser proportion of people allergic to most other foods
share the same risk.
 Increasing the severity with asthma: People with asthma are more
likely to experience anaphylaxis and to have more severe respiratory
problems during anaphylaxis. The combination of food allergy (espe-
cially to peanuts and tree nuts) and asthma seems to put people at risk
for dangerous attacks.
 Repeating bouts of anaphylaxis: People who’ve had an anaphylactic
reaction in the past are at increased risk of future anaphylactic reac-
tions. However, everyone with anaphylaxis has had their first reaction
once, so just because a food allergy has not previously caused anaphy-
laxis does not place you in the low-risk category.

Chapter 2: Turning Allergies Inside Out: Probable Causes and Common Symptoms

Taking the focus off of food allergy
No doubt about it — food allergies can cause a wide variety of symptoms rang-
ing from a mild tummy ache to a major system shutdown, but food allergy can’t
be blamed for every medical condition known to humankind. Unfortunately,
people commonly suspect food allergy as the root cause of a host of maladies.
In the following sections, I encourage you and your doctor to consider more
obvious causes and cures before pointing the finger at a food allergy.
The risk involved in mistakenly suspecting food allergy as the cause of other
medical and behavioral issues is that the time, energy, and resources you
spend in pursuing an unlikely cause is wasted. You’re better off seeking help
from specialists who treat these conditions. 
Meeting the rare breed of symptoms
Medical wisdom advises doctors that “When you hear hoof beats think of a
horse rather than a zebra.” In other words, suspect the most common causes
first before testing for causes that are less likely.
Food allergies, for example, can cause other conditions — arthritis, inflamma-
tory bowel disease, migraine headaches, or recurrent ear infections, but when
these conditions arise, you need to investigate their more common causes first
before suspecting food allergies. Only after ruling out more likely causes (or if
these conditions are accompanied by other symptoms that can be more read-
ily attributed to food allergy) should you suspect food allergy as the cause.
Keeping food allergies out of the psychiatrist’s office
Some people want to blame everything on a food allergy, including psychi-
atric and behavioral disorders, such as attention deficit disorder, hyperactiv-
ity, and depression. As I write these words, a quick search on the Internet
revealed over four million Web pages dealing with the relationship of atten-
tion deficit disorder and hyperactivity with food allergy. These conditions,
however, are rarely, if ever, due to a true food allergy.
In caring for patients with food allergy, I’ve learned to never say “never,” so
I’m not claiming that behavioral disorders and other conditions can’t possi-
bly be related to food allergy, but the likelihood is extremely low.
I see many families who are hoping to find an easy and quick fix to significant
behavioral issues by first exploring the possibility of a food allergy. In doing
so, their children might be missing out on some wonderful therapies that are
available elsewhere.

I
gnorance may be bliss when knowledge causes undue anxiety, but with
food allergies, ignorance can be deadly and may amplify your anxiety. Not
knowing which foods trigger your reactions, how much of a particular food is
problematic, and the various ways the allergen can and cannot enter your
system, is like jumping into the boxing ring wearing a blindfold. You don’t
know when your opponent is going to hit you, where you’re going to get hit,
how much it will hurt, or what you can possibly do to fend off the blows. You
don’t even know if your opponent is in the ring!
This chapter strips away the blindfold and empowers you with the knowledge
you need to identify the most common allergenic foods and orient yourself to
the three ways that the allergens in these foods can enter your system — by
ingestion, contact, or inhalation. I attempt to assuage your fears of incidental
contact allergies by revealing the real level of risk. And I place inhalation aller-
gies in their proper perspective, so you won’t freak out at the sight of a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich. 
By the end of this chapter, you’ll be well prepared to identify the most common
allergenic foods and establish a healthy vigilance without becoming unduly
anxious.
In this chapter, I also answer the two questions that most of my patients ask: 
 How much of an allergen does it take to trigger a reaction? 
 How serious will my next reaction be?

Naming the Common Culprits
When you begin to explore the wide variety of foods that people consume all
around the globe, you’re likely to be surprised at the number of foods that
don’t cause allergic reactions in most people. Only a handful of edibles are
predominantly responsible for causing the most problems. In fact, I can count
the number of common suspects on my fingers and still have one finger left.
In the United States, the following foods cause the most problems:
 Cow’s milk
 Hen’s eggs
 Peanuts
 Soy beans
 Wheat
 Tree nuts
 Fish
 Shellfish
 Sesame seed, sunflower seed, and other seeds
Because allergies are caused by a genetic disposition combined with exposure,
common allergic foods vary by geographical location and culture. Populations
that consume more fish, for example, have a higher incidence of fish allergies.
In the following sections, I introduce you to the nine foods that are responsi-
ble for the lion’s share of food allergies and present a character sketch of
each suspect.
Condemning cow’s milk
Milk is often touted as “the perfect food.” One distraught lactose-intolerant
patient amended that claim by stating, “Milk is the perfect food . . . for cows.”
Around the world, cow’s milk is the most common cause of food allergy, espe-
cially in children, because they drink the most milk at an age when allergies
are most likely to develop. 
The amount of milk protein that triggers a reaction and the severity of the
reaction vary tremendously from one person to another. An extremely sensi-
tive person can have a severe reaction to a small amount of milk protein
hiding in a candy bar, while another person who’s allergic to milk may be able
to drink a half glass of milk and have little or no reaction to it. If you have
milk allergy, consult your allergist to determine just how sensitive you are.
52
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Don’t confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance:
 Milk allergy is an allergic reaction to one or more of the major milk pro-
teins, the most important of which are casein, whey, and lactoglobulin.
When you’re allergic to milk, your doctor is likely to recommend that
you avoid all forms of milk protein. 
 Lactose intolerance has nothing to do with milk proteins, but with the
sugar in milk. People who are lactose intolerant don’t have the enzyme
required to break down the sugar in milk.
Avoiding all forms of milk sounds bad enough. No milk? No cheese? No
butter? No ice cream?! But the reality is even worse. Milk is an ingredient in 
a multitude of foods, from baby foods to breads to baked goods and milk
chocolate, as well as all kinds of processed foods, so avoiding milk typically
involves scratching about half of the most common foods off your grocery
list. The good news is that the food industry offers plenty of milk, cheese,
butter, ice cream, and yogurt substitutes, as described in Chapter 18.
Children often outgrow a milk allergy later in childhood. In Chapter 15, I explain
the likelihood of growing out of various food allergies and show you how to
safely introduce foods later in life with your doctor’s supervision.
Cracking open the mystery of hen’s eggs
Eggs are a great source of protein for some and an equally great source of dis-
tress for people who are allergic to them. As with milk, several egg proteins
can cause allergic reactions, the most common of which is called ovalbumin.
Although you can’t miss the eggs in your grocery store’s dairy section, you
really have to look hard to spot them out in the real world. Here are some
tips to guide you in finding hidden eggs and avoiding them:
 Read labels carefully, because eggs hide in many food products. Chapter 6
offers an egg identification key that can assist you in deciphering labels.
 Most egg substitutes contain eggs or egg proteins, but in Chapter 18, I
name one egg substitute that’s completely safe.
 While the egg white is much more allergenic than egg yolk, most people
with egg allergy need to avoid all forms of egg. Why? Two reasons. First,
because the egg yolk contains allergenic proteins. Second, because no
one can separate an egg any better than you can — all egg yolks also
contain egg white allergens. 
 Some vaccines, especially the common flu shot, contain egg protein.
53
Chapter 3: Spotting the Usual Suspects: Wherefore Art Thou, Allergen?

Pointing the finger at peanuts
Peanut allergy ranks about third on most top-food-allergy lists, but this rank-
ing is misleading. Peanut allergy occurs in less than 1 percent of young chil-
dren, but then becomes more common than milk and egg allergy as people
outgrow those allergies. (You’re less likely to outgrow peanut allergy than you
are to outgrow milk or egg allergy.) The medical community doesn’t have the
statistics to know for sure, but more Americans may be allergic to peanut
than to any other food.
Peanut allergy also earns a top spot on the common-food-allergy charts, due
to the potential severity of its reactions. While milk and egg allergies can and
do cause very serious reactions in some people, most people with peanut
allergy are at risk of severe reactions. 
Peanuts commonly cause reactions with very small exposures, so even a conta-
minated product, such as a sugar cookie that shared a spatula with a peanut
cookie, is capable of causing a severe reaction. 
Researches have thoroughly characterized the specific peanut proteins that
commonly cause allergic reactions, and have observed unique aspects to the
way these proteins are constructed that make them such potent allergens.
Skip to Chapter 4 to find out more about what makes peanut proteins so sin-
isterly special and gather tips on how to survive and thrive with a peanut
allergy.
Censoring soy
Soy, short for soybean, is a member of the legume family, and as such, it’s in
the same family as the peanut. Of course, the peanut is the black sheep of the
legume family due to its notoriety for causing the most severe allergic reac-
tions, but soy has its own nefarious reputation because soy is everywhere.
And since exposure is a key component to the acquisition of a food allergy,
soy’s widespread use makes soy a very common problem food. In fact, one of
the first major uses of soy was as a substitute for milk protein in infant formu-
las, where it was introduced largely because the medical community in the
1950s and ’60s thought it to be much less allergenic than milk.
Because of the widespread use of soy, avoiding soy is a monumental chal-
lenge. Food manufacturers commonly use soy flour in breads and other
bakery items, and soy makes its way into a number of food substitutes, espe-
cially substitutes designed for those with peanut, milk, and egg allergies.
Because soy is high in protein, it helps boost the protein content of many
foodstuffs. Skip to Chapter 6 for guidance on how to spot soy on ingredient
labels and identify common foods that contain soy.

Blaming the bakery: Wheat
Western diets are chock full of wheat. It’s the main ingredient in most breads,
cereals, pastas, and almost all baked goods. It also finds its way into numer-
ous crackers and a host of popular snacks and finger foods. When you realize
just how ingrained wheat is in the Western diet, when you look out over the
aisles at your local grocery store, you may begin to envision amber waves of
grain.
As with the other entries on our list of common allergenic foods, wheat’s pro-
teins instigate the trouble, and separating the protein from the grain is nearly
impossible. If you have wheat allergy, read food labels carefully and remain
aware of the foods that most commonly contain wheat, as explained in
Chapter 15. For assistance in finding wheat substitutes, including replace-
ments for bread and cereal, check out Chapter 22.
Wheat commonly sneaks its way into soups and sauces as a thickening agent,
so don’t let your guard down by thinking that you’re safe ordering the soup
without the French bread. Find out what’s in the soup, too.
Shaking the tree for tree nut allergies
Most people don’t know or care where their nuts come from, but people 
who have tree nut allergies sure need to know. While peanuts, which aren’t
really nuts, grow below the soil, almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts,
macadamias, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts hang out in trees. Like peanuts,
however, these tree nuts have a nasty habit of causing severe reactions
through even the smallest exposure.
Technically, tree nuts have no family ties with peanuts, but their allergens
share structural characteristics, which may explain why they are so potent
and why 30 to 40 percent of the people who have peanut allergy also have
tree nut allergies. If you’re allergic to one tree nut, chances are pretty good
that you’re allergic to at least one or two other members of the tree nut
family, so you’re best bet is to avoid the entire family.
For a tree-nut allergen identification chart and instructions on how to pick
the tree nuts out of a food label, refer to Chapter 6. Finding a suitable substi-
tute for tree nuts can be quite a challenge. If you’re not allergic to seeds, sun-
flower seeds may be nutty enough to satisfy your cravings.
Fishing for allergens in fish
For those with a genetic predisposition to allergies, the more fish they eat,
the more likely they are to develop a fish allergy. Consequently, if you troll
55
Chapter 3: Spotting the Usual Suspects: Wherefore Art Thou, Allergen?

the globe and compare the prevalence of fish allergies in various countries,
you find that countries that consume a lot of fish have a higher incidence of
fish allergies than countries that consume less fish. Fish allergy is far more
common, for example, in Japan and Scandinavian countries than it is in the
United States. 
As with the tree nut family, when you’re allergic to one fish you’re usually
allergic to others, and your doctor is likely to recommend that you shun
every member of the fish family.
Prying into shellfish allergies
Although shellfish allergy ranks eighth on our list of common food allergies,
it’s the number one most common food allergy in adults. Consider it a late
bloomer, developing later in a person’s life, commonly in young adults. A
recent study shows that more than 2 percent of adults have shellfish allergy.
When you’re dealing with a shellfish allergy, you may be tempted to lump all
shellfish together, but they’re actually divided into two major groups:
 Crustacea, including shrimp, crab, and lobster 
 Mollusks, including clams, scallops, oysters, and mussels
Complete shellfish avoidance is usually the rule once a shellfish allergy devel-
ops, although many people with a crustacea allergy may be able to tolerate
mollusks, and vice versa. Discuss this with your allergist before indulging.
Suspecting sesame, sunflower, 
and other seedy culprits
Batting clean-up on the food allergy roster is sesame seed and other seed
allergies, but in at least one country, Israel, sesame allergy is number one. If
you hung with me through the previous sections, you can probably guess
why that is — the Israeli diet includes a lot of sesame seeds and oil. 
In the United States, the medical community has witnessed a surge in sesame
allergy over the past 10 to 20 years, and some allergists estimate that sesame
may well now be in the top five bracket. One reason for this dramatic increase
may be due at least in part to the introduction of more sesame in our diets.
With restaurants offering sesame seed buns and bread sticks and the increased
use of sesame oil in dressings and other food products, exposure is on the rise.
56
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Other seed allergies, such as allergies to sunflower seeds, poppy seeds, and
pumpkin seeds, do occur but are much less common, and most people with
one seed allergy do not need to avoid all seeds. 
Ingesting Allergens with Your Food
One of the main characteristics that distinguishes food allergens from other
allergens, such as pollen, is that you generally eat food allergens. As I explain
later in this chapter, allergens can also enter your system through physical
contact and via the air you breath, in the case of airborne allergens, but most
food reactions occur as the result of eating an allergen.
The fact that eating an allergen triggers most reactions inspires two of the
most common questions I field on a daily basis:
 How much of an allergen does it take to cause a reaction?
 How severe will my next reaction be?
Unfortunately, the answers to those two questions vary from one individual
to another and can even vary for one individual over time. In the following
two sections, I reveal why the answers to those questions are so tentative
and provide guidance on how to work with your doctor to discover answers
that more specifically address your food sensitivity.
Gauging how much it takes 
to trigger a reaction
When someone asks me the amount of food required to trigger an allergy, I
ask them to rephrase that question. A better question is “How much of a par-
ticular food is required to trigger my allergy?” The point here is that every-
one’s different. Each person who has a food allergy has a specific threshold —
a specific dose of the food that sets the allergic reaction in motion. For some
people that dose is incredibly small, for example 1/1000 of a peanut, but
below that amount no reaction may occur. For others the threshold dose is
quite large, for example five or six whole peanuts. 
Several factors further complicate the process of coming up with a concrete
answer that covers all cases:
 The dose that causes a reaction may change over time. In other words,
you may be more or less sensitive to a food a couple months or years
down the road. If you’re lucky, your sensitivity tapers off completely and
you outgrow your allergy, as explained in Chapter 15. If you’re not so
lucky, your sensitivity can increase over time (unfortunately a common
57
Chapter 3: Spotting the Usual Suspects: Wherefore Art Thou, Allergen?

occurrence with some allergies), and then you may react to lower and
lower doses and your reactions may increase in severity.
 You may be more sensitive when your immune system is revved up. A
recent food reaction or a bad pollen season, for example, can lower your
threshold.
 Your tolerance level can fluctuate. You may be able to tolerate a given
amount of food very intermittently, but as you expose yourself to it
more regularly, you begin to react to it.
 Some evidence suggests that in some people, exposure to even a small
amount of food, even though the exposure doesn’t cause an obvious
reaction, makes it harder to outgrow the allergy. The idea here is that
these small exposures rev up the immune system and prolong the allergy,
sometimes even making the allergy stronger and more dangerous.
Patients who can tolerate small amounts of a known allergen on an occa-
sional basis may benefit from a rotation diet, as discussed in Chapter 6. For
example, if you have milk allergy and the bread you enjoy contains tiny
amounts of milk, you may be okay eating that bread once a week. Don’t try
this on your own; consult your doctor first. Exposing yourself to even a small
amount of the offending food could result in a severe reaction, and even if it
doesn’t, the exposure could compromise your chances of outgrowing your
allergy.
Predicting the severity of 
an ingestion reaction
Once you’ve experienced an allergic reaction, the first question is often “How
bad will the next one be?” 
The rule of thumb for predicting the severity of your next reaction is that the
higher your sensitivity and the more allergen you ingest above and beyond
your threshold the worse the reaction. In other words, if you eat an oatmeal
cookie that shared a spatula with a peanut butter cookie and you have a mild
reaction, you can very likely expect a much more severe reaction if you
gobble up a cookie with five peanuts in it.
Like most rules of thumb, this one begins to break down upon closer exami-
nation. Allergies tend to defy rules and common logic and toss in variables
that call predictions into question:
58
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

 Your threshold can change. Say you eat 25/1000 of a peanut on a day
when your threshold is 1/1000 of a peanut. On another day, you eat
40/1000 of a peanut when your threshold is 35/1000 of a peanut. You can
expect a more severe reaction in the first case, even though you con-
sume much more peanut in the second case.
 Your reactivity can change. If you’ve had a recent reaction or you’re in
the midst of a bad pollen season, you may react more strongly than
normal.
 Having asthma can increase the severity of reactions, especially reac-
tions that cause breathing problems. In general, the worse the asthma,
the more severe the reaction. In other words, you can expect less severe
reactions on days when your asthma is under control. (Asthma and food
allergies commonly occur in the same people.)
People (including many doctors) often say that severity increases with each
subsequent reaction. However, while this may occur, allergies follow no pre-
dictable pattern. You really can’t predict the severity of your next reaction.
The best approach is to play it safe and team up with your doctor to track
your allergy’s ups and downs. Most importantly, always assume that a worse
reaction may occur and be prepared to treat it, as I point out in Chapter 7. 
Calming the Fears of Contact Reactions
When AIDS first captured the headlines, mobs of the irrational and uninformed
gave their fears free reign. They imagined the worst possible scenarios — their
children catching AIDS by sharing a desk with a fellow student who had AIDS,
the possibility of passing AIDS through a handshake or a hug, mosquitoes car-
rying the AIDS virus over the neighbor’s fence. None of that happened, but the
fears whipped many people and even entire communities into a frenzy.
Although everybody knows that you can’t catch an allergy from someone
else, uninformed food allergy sufferers and uninformed parents of children
who have food allergies occasionally develop similar overblown fears, often
quite justifiably. They may read an article written by an ill-informed writer,
hear a rumor, or let their imaginations run wild because they know first hand
how serious a reaction can be.
In any event, most of the fears and concerns over contact reactions are
overblown. In the following sections, I attempt to calm any lingering fears you
may have.

Chapter 3: Spotting the Usual Suspects: Wherefore Art Thou, Allergen?

Contact reactions occur when a problem food touches the skin. Common
examples of this include having milk spilled on you, being touched by some-
one who has peanut butter on his hands, or being kissed by someone who
has just eaten eggs (something that’s not all that pleasant even if you don’t
have an egg allergy).
Predicting the severity 
of a contact reaction
Although contact reactions are very common, they’re generally much less
severe than reactions you experience when you eat an offending food.
Contact reactions are also typically localized to the site of the contact; that
is, the allergen doesn’t get into your system and trigger a full-body response.
Contact reactions, however, can be more serious, depending on the amount
of contact and on the location of contact — the body part that comes in con-
tact with the allergen. Following are descriptions of three scenarios in which
the contact reaction may be more severe:
 Significant exposure: Having a few drops of milk splashed on you typi-
cally results in mild reaction, if any. If you (or some clumsy ox) spills a
glass of milk on you, that may cause a more severe reaction.
 Contact with the eyes: Your eyes are more than a gateway to your soul.
They can be a gateway to allergens, as well. Your eyes are one of your
most sensitive body parts, and even a little allergen can cause major
swelling. Your eyes can even absorb allergens, which is almost like
eating the food, because the allergen can travel systemically (throughout
your entire body).
 Hand contact to mouth ingestion: If your hands come in contact with an
allergen and then you put your hands to your mouth or touch some non-
allergenic food you’re eating, the contact reaction can turn into an inges-
tion reaction. This scenario causes additional concern in relation to
young children who may be less aware of their surroundings and more
prone to putting their hands in their mouths.
 Mouth to mouth ingestion: Kissing someone who has recently eaten a
food you’re allergic to can cause a reaction, sometimes severe. By fol-
lowing a few simple precautions, you can virtually eliminate this risk. In
Chapter 14, I provide some safe-kissing tips for teenagers.
Thankfully, although these three scenarios engender tons of worry, none of
them are at all common.

Revealing the low risk of hidden dangers:
From library books to monkey bars
If we let our imaginations run wild, we can think of innumerable ways in
which contact reactions might occur. Just think of a day at school and imag-
ine that a few children walk into school with peanut butter all over their
hands. As the pass through the school, they might leave a deadly trail of
peanut on door knobs, drinking fountains, library books, art supplies, com-
puter keyboards, basketballs . . . even the monkey bars! 
What, though, is the real risk? The answer is that the likelihood of these inci-
dental contact exposures actually leading to a reaction is extremely small. I
care for thousands of patients with food allergy and have dealt with tens of
thousands of reactions. Of all the reactions I’ve witnessed, I can count on one
hand the number that we could trace back to this sort of hidden, unsuspected
exposure.
61
Chapter 3: Spotting the Usual Suspects: Wherefore Art Thou, Allergen?
Washing peanut worries away
Concerned patients and caregivers and the
always curious press call into our office daily to
ask about the risk of contact reactions. To more
accurately answer these questions, we did a
study published in 1994 called the “Distribution
of Peanut Protein in the Environment.” The pur-
pose of this study was to look for peanut aller-
gen under various conditions and examine the
effectiveness of cleaning agents for allergen
removal. We went into schools and looked for
peanut contamination on cafeteria tables and
other surfaces and measured the presence of
residual peanut protein after using various
cleaning products on hands and tabletops. 
We found that after hand washing with liquid
soap, bar soap, or commercial wipes, peanut
protein was undetectable. Plain water and
antibacterial hand sanitizer left detectable
peanut on 3 of 12 and 6 of 12 hands, respec-
tively. Common household cleaning agents
removed peanut allergen from tabletops, except
dishwashing liquid, which left the protein on 4
of 12 tables. We evaluated 6 preschools and
schools and found peanut protein on 1 of 13
water fountains, 0 of 22 desks, and 0 of 36 cafe-
teria tables. We concluded from these investi-
gations that peanut allergen is relatively easy to
clean from hands and tabletops with common
cleaning agents and does not appear to be
widely distributed in preschools and schools.
Antibacterial gels, however, were very ineffec-
tive in removing the allergen, and we don’t rec-
ommend them for this purpose.

Refusing to let your allergies 
control your life
I’ve cared for many families who ultimately decided to home school their
children specifically over fear of potential contact reactions. I have seen chil-
dren become so paranoid that they won’t hold hands with another child or
even touch a door knob. While sensible precautions are warranted, remain
rational and keep your imagination in check, for your own good as well as the
good of those under your care. Follow these sensible precautions to allay
your concerns:
 Remain aware of your environment and of any potential hazards with-
out becoming obsessed over them.
 Pay attention to major exposures, and let the little stuff go.
 Keep your hands clean and out of your mouth.
 Be careful kissing. A peck on the cheek is fine, but kissing on the lips is
riskier. See Chapter 14 for safe-kissing tips.
 Wipe down tables before meals. My colleagues and I have shown in our
research that peanut protein can be cleaned from hands and tables with
soap and water, as well as most types of wipes. (See the sidebar, “Washing
peanut worries away,” to find out about a study that shows just how easy
it is to remove peanut remnants from hands and eating surfaces.)
Don’t let the myriad of possible contact exposures run (and ruin) your life or
foster irrational fears in a child. 
Clearing the Air About the Risks of
Airborne Allergens
Can peanut dust make you sick? If someone’s eating a peanut butter sand-
wich next to you in the cafeteria, can that make you sick? What about air-
borne particles from other foods . . . do they pose a danger? 
The short answer to these questions is yes, airborne allergens can affect
people who are sensitive to those allergens. In some, relatively rare cases, air-
borne allergens can induce severe reactions. The level of risk, however,
requires a somewhat longer answer, as I serve up in the following sections. 
62
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Recognizing the risk: When 
allergens take to the air
Whenever someone cracks open a peanut, tears open a package of powered
milk, kneads bread dough, or fries a fish, allergens can take to the air and travel
across a room where unsuspecting food allergy sufferers can inhale them.
Although these situations commonly occur, serious reactions from airborne
exposure are not terribly common, though they can and do happen. The trick
to dealing with such situations is to acquire the skills for differentiating
between situations that pose a real risk and those that pose little or no risk.
The risk of experiencing an airborne reaction varies greatly depending on the
concentration of food protein in the air. And this hinges on how the food is
handled, how close you are to the food being handled, and how confined a
space you’re in. With peanuts, for example, you face four levels of risk, as
explained in the following sections.
Assessing level-one risks
Level-one risks arise when someone is eating a food next to you that contains
the allergen as part of its ingredient; for example, a peanut butter or grilled
cheese sandwich. In this instance, the risk that food protein becomes air-
borne and causes a reaction, especially a severe reaction, is extremely low.
Even though you can smell the peanut or cheese, the scent arises from aro-
matic oils and has nothing to do with the protein that triggers a reaction. Not

Dr. Bob weighs in on airborne peanut risks
I have a severe peanut allergy. A number of
years ago I hired a new nurse to work in my
food allergy clinic. We worked in different
offices in the morning and afternoon and we
would often share a ride between offices. For
the first week she ate a peanut butter sandwich
in my car every day for lunch. The smell was so
offensive that I could barely eat my lunch, but I
had no allergic reactions. 
My nurse soon learned from one of our patients
that I had a severe peanut allergy and she was
absolutely mortified. I told her it was the best
example I could ever give her of just how low
the risk is to be around peanut butter. In spite of
the smell, no peanut protein was shooting out of
her sandwich, and I was really at no risk. 
A few months later, we went to a meeting where
for some inconceivable reason they were serv-
ing peanuts in the meeting room. Peanut shells
carpeted the floor, and we were in very
cramped quarters. I promptly excused myself
because this situation really did put me at risk.
The sponsor of the meeting, who had selected
the peanuts as entertainment before the lec-
ture, was less than pleased since they lost their
speaker for the evening!

enough peanut or milk protein emanates from that sandwich to put you at
any real risk, and reactions with this type of exposure are rare, even if you
are in close proximity to the sandwich eater. (For a first-hand look at the com-
parative dangers of inhalation risks from peanut, check out the sidebar, “Dr.
Bob weighs in on airborne peanut risks, earlier in this chapter.”)
Assessing level-two risks
One step up from level one are level-two risks; for example, you’re on an air-
plane where your fellow passengers are tearing into their tiny bags of peanuts.
In this case, small amounts of peanut dust, which does contain the protein,
may become airborne, especially since the bags of peanuts are being opened
in the negative-pressure environment of the airplane cabin. The risk may fur-
ther increase because you’re in close proximity to the peanuts, you’re in very
confined space, and the air’s re-circulating, potentially making matters worse.
Severe reactions have occurred on airplanes that appeared to be due to this
airborne exposure, but you have to put the risk in perspective:
 Tens of millions of people with peanut allergy have flown with peanuts
being served on board, yet only a very small number of people have
reported reactions.
 If the risk were high and planes were routinely making emergency land-
ings due to allergic reactions, they would have stopped serving peanuts
a long time ago. 
 As someone with a serious peanut allergy, I have flown thousands of
times with no reactions.
Several major airlines have stopped serving peanuts to address the concerns
of their passengers who have peanut allergy. The decision to go peanut-free is
more for public relations reasons than to reduce the true allergy risk.
I tell my patients to arrange for peanut-free flights, at least for their peace of
mind, but personally, I don’t spend a lot of time looking for peanut-free flights
when I travel. Skip to Chapter 11 for more travel tips.
Assessing level-three and -four risks
Risk levels three and four occur when people are shelling peanuts around
you. This clearly causes more disturbance and a greater likelihood that
peanut protein can become airborne, especially when the peanut shells cover
the floor around you and people are walking on them, kicking up more dust.
The key features that differentiate risk levels three and four are the proximity
to the peanuts and, more importantly, how confined the space is, as demon-
strated in the following two examples:
64
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

 Level-three risk: In an outdoor environment — for example, a baseball
game — reactions are very uncommon because the allergen is swept
away very readily by the open air. 
 Level-four risk: In an indoor space, especially a small space like the
waiting area of a restaurant, the risk of reactions rises dramatically. 
Assessing the risks of airborne allergens in cooking
When you’re cooking at home, you have control over what you cook and how
you cook it. By following the precautions in Chapter 10, you’re safe in your
own home. When you go out to eat or drop in at your local coffee shop, how-
ever, the risks of experiencing an airborne reaction increase. Food allergists
commonly see reactions triggered by the cooking of eggs, fish, and shellfish,
especially on an open stove. 
To reduce the risk, take the following precautions:
 Steer clear of the cooking area. If you’re eating dinner at someone’s
house, stay in another room while your host prepares the meal. If you’re
in a restaurant with an open kitchen, sit at the table farthest from the
open area. 
 Run an efficient ventilation fan. Of course, you don’t have any control
over this at a restaurant, but if you’re at someone else’s house, you can
ask them to turn on the exhaust fan.
 Tell people about your food allergies. When eating at someone else’s
house, let them know what you’re allergic to. Most friends and family
members are willing to adjust the menu if they know what to do.
Remain vigilant of possible exposures from cooking and food preparation. In
one week alone, I saw two patients who experienced airborne reactions at
restaurants. One patient reacted in a restaurant with an open kitchen (the
server unfortunately seated the family right next to the kitchen). Another
patient, a curious two-year-old with milk allergy was allowed to sit on the
counter at a coffee house and watch them froth the milk for his mother’s
latte. A few minutes later, hives erupted on his face, presumably appearing
where microscopic droplets of milk landed on his skin.
Predicting the severity of 
an inhalant reaction
As with contact reactions, inhalant reactions typically are not severe. They
most often begin with a rash or hives on the face, itchy eyes, or a runny 
nose — places where the airborne food comes in contact with the body. In
65
Chapter 3: Spotting the Usual Suspects: Wherefore Art Thou, Allergen?

most instances, you can quickly recognize the early symptoms and flee the
scene (or at least move away from the cooking area) to halt the progression
of symptoms. 
The severity of a reaction is usually in direct proportion to the level of expo-
sure. Severe airborne reactions primarily occur in the following situations: 
 You get a huge dose all at once. For example, if you have a severe wheat
allergy and walk into a bakery where hundreds of loaves of bread are
being made, this huge single dose of allergen may trigger a severe reac-
tion even if you immediately exit.
 You can’t leave. If you’re on an airplane, you can’t just get up and walk
off the plane.
 You won’t leave. Sometimes people are too stubborn or embarrassed 
to leave. I’ve seen a patient with a fish allergy take a new job as a dish-
washer in a seafood restaurant. I’ve also seen a number of teenagers
who knew they were beginning to react but didn’t leave the party where
their friends were eating mass quantities of peanuts.
Be sensible about the risks, remain aware of your surroundings, and be pre-
pared to take action when you observe serious risks, but don’t let your food
allergy run (and ruin) your life.

Potentially Deadly Foe
In This Chapter

P
eanuts are the bad boys of allergenic foods. They’re tasty, tempting, and
pervasive, showing up in all sorts of foods where you’d never expect to
see them. They can cause extreme, life-threatening allergic reactions, even
airborne reactions. That’s why I devote an entire chapter to the curse of the
peanut.
In this chapter, I reveal the sometimes sinister nature of peanuts, uncover
many of their favorite hangouts, separate fact from fiction concerning air-
borne peanut allergens, and show you how to avoid peanuts in the real world
without being overly concerned.
Investigating the Allergic 
Nature of Peanuts
Although “peanut allergy” isn’t exactly synonymous with “food allergy,” peanut
allergy exemplifies the food allergy phenomenon in a nutshell. It functions as a
key to understanding just how common food allergy is, how the prevalence of
food allergy has risen, and just how deadly a food allergy can be.
Because peanut allergy typifies food allergy, researchers have focused a great
deal of research on it over the past 20 years, seeking answers to these most
fundamental questions:

 Why are peanut reactions so serious?
 Why do you get peanut allergy?
 Why is peanut allergy becoming more common?
 What can be done to prevent peanut allergy?
 Can doctors treat peanut allergy?
The whole purpose of this book is to address these questions for any food
allergy you have and express the answers in a way that assists you in living
well with your food allergies on a daily basis. With peanuts, however, the
third question, “Why are peanut reactions so serious?” earns additional atten-
tion, provided in the following sections.
Probing the peanut protein connection
As I explain in Chapter 2, a handful of proteins are primarily responsible for
triggering allergic reactions, because your immune system sees them as the
bad guys. Peanut proteins — specifically the three proteins fondly referred to
as Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 3 — look more like the bad guys than most
other food allergens. (A protein is made up of a long string of building blocks
called amino acids, which are folded into all sorts of shapes and sizes. No two
proteins look exactly alike.)
Without becoming too technical, what makes peanut proteins so capable of
stimulating an allergic reaction is the way in which they’re folded. (Molecular
size and stability may also be contributing factors.) Peanut proteins are
folded in such a way that the protein pieces responsible for stimulating the
immune system are very much exposed, rather than concealed inside the
molecule. This gives the molecule a high profile that’s easy for your immune
system to recognize.
Although peanut proteins are easy for your immune system to recognize,
researchers still do not know why some people’s immune systems react to
them so strongly. Do they look like something more sinister? Hopefully, future
research can provide the answer.
Most people with peanut allergy have IgE antibodies against all three high-
profile peanut proteins — Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 3, so when you eat a
peanut, you’re often getting a triple dose of allergen.
Acknowledging the deadly risk
Not all people with peanut allergy have life-threatening reactions to it, but
this lowly legume, more than any other food allergen, is capable of causing
severe and sometimes fatal reactions. Moreover, peanut can trigger these
68
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

reactions with exquisitely small exposures. In studies of fatal food reactions,
peanut and tree nuts are responsible for the vast majority of all such reactions. 
If you have peanut allergy, remain on the lookout for even trace amounts of
peanut, which unfortunately shows up in a wide variety of foods. In the fol-
lowing sections I guide you on your quest to stay peanut free.
Playing Find-the-Peanut on Your Plate
Because of this risk of severe reactions with even minute peanut exposures,
people with peanut allergy must play a never-ending game of hide and seek
with the elusive peanut. Peanuts veil their presence in a surprising number of
foods and travel incognito under a host of food label pseudonyms, so you
can’t assume that just because a particular dish or food sounds safe, it really
is safe.
In the following sections, I point out the foods that pose the highest risk and
show you specifically how to avoid peanut when dining out.
Uncovering peanut’s favorite hideouts 
The brilliant inventor George Washington Carver discovered 300 uses for the
peanut. Food manufacturers and cooks have discovered infinitely more uses
for peanut, many of which make the peanut nearly impossible to detect.
Fortunately, food labeling is conservative, typically warning consumers even
if the food “may contain peanuts.” Unlabeled and prepared foods are respon-
sible for a high majority of reactions. These foods generally fit in one of the
two following categories:
 Foods in which you would least expect peanut, such as in sauces and
salad dressings, that contain peanut as an ingredient. 
 Foods that do not contain peanut as an ingredient but have been conta-
minated by peanut during production or preparation.
In the following sections, I point out the most suspect foods.
The greatest risk for peanut contaminated foods occurs when other products
that do contain peanut are processed or prepared in close proximity to or
using the same equipment as the food that you assume is peanut free. This
risk is amplified in smaller facilities where the risk of significant cross conta-
mination may be greatest, such as a bakery, restaurant, candy shop, or ice
cream parlor. 
69
Chapter 4: Picking On Peanuts: A Potentially Deadly Foe

Deconstructing cookies
Of all foods, cookies may well be responsible for the greatest number of acci-
dental peanut exposures. Peanuts pop up in cookies you’d never suspect
would contain peanuts, and cookies that are supposedly peanut free often are
the victims of cross contamination. Following are some common scenarios
that should make you think twice about eating a cookie you haven’t baked
yourself:
 A baker decides that a few ground peanuts, a little peanut butter, or
even peanut flour would make this batch really special. Because the
peanut is pulverized and is used in such small quantities, it’s completely
disguised, making detection by sight, smell, or even taste nearly impos-
sible. Pulverized peanuts also find their way into some pie crusts.
 A restaurant serves typically peanut-free chocolate chip cookies. A
new cook is hired who always sticks ground up peanuts in the dough to
make the cookies a little crunchy. The server assures you that the
restaurant’s cookies are peanut free, not knowing that the change of
cooks resulted in a change in the recipe.
 The server assures you that a particular brownie doesn’t have peanut
in it, but when she dishes up your dessert, she uses the same spatula
she used to serve up a dessert that contains peanuts. You may think
that the amount of peanut residue would be miniscule, and it is, but it’s
enough to cause a severe reaction in some people. Cross contamination
may occur when the baker or server uses the same mixing bowl, cookie
sheet, spatula, or tongs.
Digging into other baked goods
While cookies and similar products carry the greatest risk, all baked goods
are suspect. Cakes and cupcakes that seem perfectly safe commonly cause
peanut reactions. How can this happen? Cross contamination and hidden
ingredients are often the root causes:
 A dirty spatula or other serving utensil: A serving utensil used to serve
an unsafe food can sometimes transfer enough of that food to a safe
food to trigger a reaction.
 A contaminated knife: A knife used to spread peanut butter icing on one
cake and then spread peanut-free icing on your cake or cut your cake
can spoil your dessert.
 A flavoring that seems safe: You wouldn’t suspect that something called
“Almond Extract” would trigger a peanut reaction unless you’re also
allergic to almonds, but I recently saw a girl who had a severe reaction
after eating a supposedly safe cupcake a neighbor gave her. It turned out
that the particular artificial almond extract the neighbor used was actu-
ally made of peanut.

Uncovering peanuts in candies
If you’re looking for a tough challenge, mosey down the candy aisle at your
local grocery store or pharmacy and try to find candies (especially choco-
lates) that don’t contain peanuts. Even candy bars that contain no discern-
able peanuts may have labels that warn people with peanut allergies to avoid
them with messages like “May contain peanuts,” “Traces of peanuts,” and
“Produced in a facility that uses peanuts.” 
Candies produced by major manufacturers are almost always a safe choice,
as long as the label does not list peanut as one of its ingredients. By being a
diligent, vigilant label reader, you can consume these candies with a very low
risk of reaction. For more about reading labels, see Chapter 6.
The most suspect candies fall into one of the following categories:
 Candy from smaller manufacturers: Watch out for smaller manufactur-
ers who don’t follow strict labeling guidelines or don’t label their candy.
 Unlabeled candies and other goodies: For example, you’d have a tough
time finding a safe candy in a fudge or candy shop... or in a gift box from
a fudge or candy shop.
71
Chapter 4: Picking On Peanuts: A Potentially Deadly Foe
Assuming my way to severe reactions
When I was growing up, my school system
baked the best brownies. Even better for me
was that they were peanut free. For nine years,
I had eaten the brownies without experiencing
a single reaction or even a tinge of suspicion.
All that changed in my sophomore year of high
school. That’s when the high school cafeteria
modified its age-old brownie recipe to take
advantage of a peanut butter surplus. I never
thought to ask if the brownie was safe, because
I had eaten the “same” brownies for so many
years. As soon as I ate that peanut-butter-laced
brownie, I started to feel its ill effects, which
ultimately led to a severe reaction. From that
day forward, I made it a rule to never eat a
baked good that I didn’t personally prepare
myself or that my mom hadn’t baked for me. (I’ve
never had a single reaction at home since the
time I was diagnosed with a peanut allergy.)
I made an exception to the rule just once, about
15 years ago . . . after I had become an allergist
and had learned a great deal about peanut
allergy. We were celebrating the holidays with
a number of my co-workers and a colleague of
mine — a world-renowned authority in food
allergy. My colleague presented me with a gift
of beautifully decorated cookies. As he handed
them to me, without me even asking, he reas-
sured me — in fact, he promised me — that
these cookies were peanut free. Unfortunately,
however, he didn’t know that his wife had also
made peanut butter cookies that morning and
that she had used the same spatula between
those cookies and mine. The level of contami-
nation was enough to cause a very severe reac-
tion. In fact, this was probably my most severe
reaction ever. Over the course of that evening I
needed five shots of epinephrine. The doctor,
his wife, and I are still very close friends, but I
have not broken my “no cookie rule” ever since.
And thankfully, I’ve had no reactions since that
time.

 Cross contaminated candies and other goodies, especially from candy
or fudge shops: Even if a small candy or fudge shop does not mention
peanut on a label, most of these shops have far too much peanut around
to successfully prevent cross contamination. I would be very nervous,
for example, eating a box of chocolate fudge or chocolate covered cher-
ries, even if the ingredient list contains no hint of peanut. 
Stick with candies from major manufacturers, and eat those only after care-
fully studying the label each time you get them. Another alternative is to pur-
chase candy from one of the guaranteed nut-free candy and baked good
manufacturers that have popped up in the last few years. Check out: 
 Vermont Nut Free Chocolates (www.vermontnutfree.com)
 Kellie’s Candies Nut-Free Confections (nutfreecandy.com)
 Rebecca’s Nut Free (rebeccasnutfree.com)
 Nothin’ Nutty (nothinnutty.com)
Finding peanuts in ice creams and tasty toppings
The rules I described for cookies and candies in the previous sections apply
to ice cream, too: 
 Stick with ice cream from major manufacturers and carefully read the
labels. Although ice cream produced in North America is rarely manu-
factured on dedicated peanut-free lines, I believe that ice cream from
major manufacturers is generally safe. However, be careful of the small
manufacturers — one study a few years ago of small ice cream manufac-
turers found that peanut contamination was quite common. Allergic
reactions to peanut are rarely traced back to cross-contaminated ice
cream from the major companies. You can call a company to learn more
about how they handle and clean their equipment.
 Make your own ice cream. Some patients decide that the only truly safe
ice cream comes from their own ice cream maker in their own kitchen.
 Avoid scooped ice cream from parlors. The ice cream reactions that
allergists witness on a regular basis occur with scooped ice cream from
ice cream parlors. As with candies and cookies, ice cream from parlors
may contain undeclared peanut as an ingredient or, more often, become
contaminated from shared ice cream scoops or nearby peanut toppings,
At an ice cream shop, the server typically uses the same scoop for all
the flavors, merely rinsing (not washing) it between orders. Once the
server opens a container of ice cream and dips into it, you’re likely to be
served a scoop of contaminated ice cream.
 Avoid the soft serve parlor, too. Soft serve ice cream resolves the prob-
lem of the contaminated scoop, but it’s not a foolproof solution. Most
soft serve shops regularly offer a peanut flavor as the flavor of the day.
You may arrive at the shop elated to see that strawberry is today’s
72
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

flavor of the day, but the shop may be dispensing today’s strawberry ice
cream from yesterday’s peanut machine. Soft serve dispensers are
extremely difficult to sanitize, and today’s ice cream is almost certainly
contaminated by yesterday’s batch.
 Skip the toppings. Almost every ice cream parlor on the planet has a
can of chopped peanuts on hand. Watch the servers rush through a
couple orders, and you quickly notice that the peanut sprinkles often fly
into the chocolate syrup, hot fudge, and other toppings. Sometimes, the
servers use the same spoon to sprinkle on different toppings. Topping
dispensers that haven’t been property cleaned and sanitized between
flavor changes can also cause problems.
Some resourceful patients bring their own scoop to the ice cream parlor to
reduce the risk of cross contamination. However, unless the person behind
the counter opens a new tub of ice cream for you to use with your nice clean
scoop, this really is not a safe practice. I do have a few patients with peanut
allergy who found local soft serve ice cream parlors where they were com-
fortable. They know that the chocolate or vanilla machine never handles any
other flavor, watch the ice cream come out of the machine and into their cup,
and simply avoid toppings altogether.
Discovering peanuts in your chili bowl and other unsuspecting places
Just looking at a bowl of chili, you may never guess that any cook worth his
wire whisk would consider sticking peanuts in her chili. Flip through a few
gourmet cookbooks, however, and you quickly discover that peanut or
peanut butter is a pretty standard ingredient. Cooks may add it to thicken the
chili, spice it up with an interesting flavor, or add a little protein in a vegetar-

The risk of chili became quite well known a number of years ago when a col-
lege student at Brown University died after eating chili in a local restaurant.
Hidden peanut can, however, show up in a host of other apparently safe
foods, including these: 
 Spaghetti sauce: I had never imagined someone sticking peanut butter in
spaghetti sauce until I dined on some spaghetti laced with peanut. To
find out what happened, check out the sidebar “Who slipped these
peanuts into my spaghetti sauce?!”
 Chicken dishes: For some cooks, the marriage of chicken and peanuts is
a match made in heaven. For those with peanut allergy, any fancy chicken
recipe is suspect. I’ve even seen fried chicken recipes that call for ground
peanuts.
 Vegetarian dishes: Without meat, vegetarians have to hunt for their pro-
tein elsewhere, and many of them find it in legumes, including peanuts.
Be careful around any vegetarian dishes.

Chapter 4: Picking On Peanuts: A Potentially Deadly Foe

The risk of hidden peanut in chili and other dishes is very real and can be
life-threatening, but you can protect yourself by following these tips:
 Check with the chef, not only the server. Ask the chef very direct ques-
tions and answer any questions the chef has to ensure that your food is
safe. See Chapter 11 for additional tips on working with the restaurant
staff to create a safe eating experience.
 Always be prepared to deal with a reaction at any time. Immediate
treatment is key to your survival and success. No matter how careful
you are, you will get burned at some time. Some creative cook will find 
a new way to use peanuts where you least expect it. 
Deciphering the mysteries of peanut oils 
On its surface, my recommendation for peanut oil may sound paradoxically
paranoid — most peanut oil is safe, but avoid all peanut oil. Let me clarify
that recommendation:
 Highly purified peanut oil is safe. A heat-processed peanut oil is typi-
cally completely or nearly completely free of the peanut proteins that
trigger reactions. Studies show that these highly purified oils do not
cause reactions even in people with severe peanut allergy.
 Cold-pressed peanut oil is dangerous. Because the oil is not heated
during processing, it’s raw oil that always contains large amounts of
peanut protein.

Who slipped these peanuts 
into my spaghetti sauce?! 
Rarely is spaghetti sauce named as a suspect
in a peanut allergy incident, but it can (and did)
happen, and it demonstrates the need to always
consult the cook before placing your order and
to always be prepared for a reaction. I learned
my lesson the hard way. 
When I was in medical school, my future wife
and I went out to eat at a health food restaurant.
We ordered the spaghetti. After one bite I knew
I was in trouble when I developed intense itch-
ing in my mouth. We asked the server who said
she was sure our food was peanut free. We
went straight into the kitchen and asked the
chef, who said “Yes.” She had tried a new
spaghetti sauce recipe that day that included
peanut butter as an added source of protein.
My reaction quickly went from bad to worse,
but fortunately, I had an epinephrine autoinjec-
tor in my pocket. Otherwise, I may well have not
been around to tell this story. 
The take-home message here is to always be
prepared. When you least expect it, a food that
appears completely harmless, a change of
cooks, or a change of recipes can expose you
to a dangerous amount of allergen. Being prop-
erly prepared at all times can literally save your
life, as it did mine.

 Almost all peanut oil is suspect, even peanut oil that’s advertised as
peanut-free. In your daily life, you can rarely be sure of the purity of a
peanut oil used in preparing your food. To be safe, strictly avoid all
forms of peanut oil.
If the world were perfect, discerning which peanut oil is safe and which one is
not would be a simple matter of reading the label or talking to the cook. The
reality though is that when you look at your bag of potato chips, you’re likely
to see peanut oil listed, void of any useful details concerning the purity of
that oil. 
A few years ago, I ran into a series of peanut oil induced reactions, when a local
restaurant chain started serving potato chips fried in cold-pressed peanut oil.
Many of the people who reported reactions knew about the peanut oil but had
been reassured by the fact that most peanut oils are indeed safe. They ate the
chips thinking that the chips would be okay . . . they weren’t. In my patients I
see peanut oil related reactions, including scenarios such as this one, at least
once a month. 
The relative purity of peanut oil makes my rule about avoiding it absolute —
avoid all peanut oil. Follow these tips to remain peanut oil free:
 Carefully read labels and avoid any food that contains peanut oil. Not
all peanut oils are created equal.
 Assume that all peanut oil, no matter how it’s processed, contains
peanut protein. You just can’t tell how peanut-protein-free any peanut
oil is.
 Ask the restaurant manager and cook if peanut oil is used. In most
cases, the restaurant manager or cook replies that the restaurant uses
“only vegetable oil.” Peanut is a vegetable, so find out the specific ingre-
dients in that vegetable oil.
Don’t panic unnecessarily if your waiter comes out after you have eaten your
French fries and says she made a terrible mistake — your fries were really
cooked in peanut oil. The risk of any given peanut oil exposure is truly very
low. Discuss with your allergist on what to do if such an incident occurs.
Dining out without peanuts
When you’re eating in, you can avoid peanuts by following the precautions I
present in Chapters 6 and 10. When dining out, however, you must remain
even more careful and vigilant to avoid peanuts by following these four steps:
1. Choose a restaurant that is less likely to use peanut in their dishes. 
2. Cross off any menu items that are likely to contain peanut. 
75
Chapter 4: Picking On Peanuts: A Potentially Deadly Foe

3. Study the menu carefully to find foods that are more likely to be
peanut-free. 
4. Confirm that the food you are interested in ordering is indeed safe. 
In the following sections, I step you through this four-step process.
Follow these same steps if you have a tree nut allergy, keeping in mind that
peanuts are more common than tree nuts in American cuisine. More and
more restaurants, however, are sprinkling tree nuts over salads and adding
them to other menu items.
Choosing a peanut-lite restaurant
Vegetarians avoid the local beef house and gravitate toward vegetarian
restaurants to take advantage of the expanded selection of vegetarian dishes.
Likewise, if you have peanut allergy, you can expand your menu selections by
dining at restaurants that offer a wider variety of peanut-free dishes. Focus
on the following types of restaurants:
 Fast food chains: A doctor’s telling you to eat fast food? Well, not
exactly, but most large fast-food chains are relatively safe places to eat
for people with peanut allergy. The most common risk with fast foods
involves the use of peanut oil, especially in the deep fryer. A number of
French fry chains, as well as one national fried chicken chain I can think
of, uses peanut oil. Even if you’re eating at a relatively safe fast-food
joint, don’t get lulled into a false sense of security. For example, one of
the major chains serves a milkshake made with peanut butter candies. 
 Steak houses: Your local steak or beef house may be one of the best
places to avoid peanuts altogether. These meat-and-potato restaurants
commonly serve up pure beef along with potatoes and salads. You still
need to be careful about the chef’s secret sauce or barbecue rub and the
salad dressings and other items, but a brief conversation with the cook
can help you work around these minor complications. 
 American cuisine: In the United States, we prefer our peanuts in baked
goods and desserts, not in the main course, so restaurants that serve
the standard American fare are pretty safe.
 Italian (et tu Pizza): While Italian cuisine may pose an issue for people
with tree nut allergy, Italian dishes and pizza are usually safe for those
with peanut allergy, although my co-author informs me that he knows of
a gourmet pizza joint that serves peanut-butter pizza. As mentioned ear-
lier, make sure the spaghetti sauce is peanut free.
 Seafood restaurants: As long as you don’t have a seafood allergy in addi-
tion to your peanut allergy, seafood restaurants are about as safe as
steak houses.
76
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Just because I list a type of restaurant as a safer choice doesn’t mean that it’s
100 percent safe. You still have to perform your due diligence and talk with
the server, cook, or restaurant manager each and every time you dine out.
Some types of restaurants, particularly those that serve up more exotic cui-
sine, may be places to avoid:
 Thai: Thai foods probably pose the greatest risk, because so many of
the main courses contain peanut. 
 Chinese: Chinese foods almost always have at least a few dishes with
peanut. Although they’re generally safer than Thai restaurants, Chinese
restaurants fall into the same high-risk category. 
 Japanese and Korean: Japanese and Korean dishes typically do not call
for peanuts, but the cooks often use imported sauces that may contain
peanuts or be contaminated with peanuts. Imported products are not
held to the same manufacturing and labeling standards as those pro-
duced in the United States. I have some patients who have found
Japanese or Korean restaurants where they are completely comfortable
eating. However, I personally feel that avoiding these restaurants is the
safest option. 
 Indian, Pakistani, Afghani, and Napalese: Indian foods often contain
peanut and pose a huge risk, although some dishes do not commonly
use peanuts and therefore may be safe (except for the possibility of
cross contamination). Again, I would avoid all Asian restaurants. 
 African, especially Sub-Saharan: African restaurants often serve up
peanut soups and a variety of peanut sauces.
 Mexican: While Americanized Mexican food rarely contains peanuts, 
the same cannot be said for authentic Mexican dishes. Beware of mole
sauces, some of which may contain peanut or tree nuts. I do not recom-
mend that you absolutely refrain from Mexican cuisine, but you must
certainly approach it with caution.
 Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries: If you’re doing the
Mediterranean Diet or eating out at a Middle Eastern restaurant, you’re
generally safe concerning peanuts, but if you’re allergic to tree nuts, too,
tread carefully in these foreign eateries. Pine nuts are a common ingredi-
ent, and these cultures have found a million and one ways to use pis-
tachios and other tree nuts.
 Health food restaurants: Health food restaurants may serve up cuisine
that’s healthier for the general populace, but for those with peanut aller-
gies, these restaurants can pose some hidden risks, especially in vege-
tarian restaurants, where peanuts are sometimes used to replace meat
proteins.
77
Chapter 4: Picking On Peanuts: A Potentially Deadly Foe

Asian foods are a common source of accidental peanut exposures both
because peanut is easily disguised in these dishes and because peanut is
used in enough other foods to lead to cross contamination. If the customer
before you ordered the Kung Pao chicken, all sorts of peanut remnants can
show up in your supposedly peanut-free dish. This is not just a theoretical
concern but rather a very common cause of reactions.
I used to eat Asian foods and thought that if I spoke to the chef and ordered
carefully I was safe. Luckily, I never had a reaction related to these Asian foods,
but the more I get into this field, the more I realize that I was playing a game of
Asian roulette. 
Crossing off dishes that are likely to contain peanuts 
Some types of prepared dishes have “peanut” written all over them. The fol-
lowing list can help you hone your skills for identifying the riskiest selections:
 Foods with sauces or gravies
 The entire dessert menu, including the ice cream
Highlighting dishes that are less likely to contain peanuts
Whether you’re dining out at a peanut-safe or a peanut-risky restaurant,
examine the menu carefully to separate the low-risk from the high-risk items.
Highlight the following types of menu items as less risky:
 Simple, straightforward dishes that you would never dream could 
contain peanuts
 Grilled foods, including chicken, beef, and fish, served with no fancy
sauces or gravies
 Pizza and most Italian foods
 Greek foods
 Fried foods, as long as you know the type of oil being used
Low-risk doesn’t mean no-risk. Even if a menu item looks like it can’t possibly
contain peanut, you can’t be sure, and you don’t know until you talk with the
cook how the item was prepared, as I explain in the following section.
Confirming that a menu item is peanut-free
When the server arrives to take your order, make sure that the server talks to
the cook directly, or ask to speak with the cook yourself to ensure that your
meal not only does not contain peanut as an ingredient but also that the cook
prepares it following a peanut-free protocol. In Chapter 11, I offer guidance on
how to communicate with restaurant personnel no matter what food you’re
allergic to. Chapter 11 also includes a restaurant card that can provide the
cook with additional details without having to step out of the kitchen during
the dinner rush.
78
Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Before placing your order, explain that you have a severe peanut allergy and
that even a trace amount could kill you. Then place your order, as in the fol-
lowing examples:
 “I would like the house salad and the grilled chicken with a baked
potato. I need to confirm with the chef that these dishes do not contain
any peanut or tree nuts and that contamination with any form of nut
cannot occur.”
 “I would like to order a cheeseburger and French fries. I need to know
exactly what type of oil is used in your deep fryers.” If the server or
cook answers, “We use pure vegetable oil.” Respond with, “I need to
know what type of vegetable oil you’re using today.”
Ask the server to be sure to wash his hands before serving your food, just in
case he handles another plate between orders that contains peanut residue.
However, don’t rely only on the server’s word alone for details about what a
particular dish contains. Be sure that the server speaks to the cook about
your order and if you have any doubt, speak directly to the cook. 
Inhaling Peanut Dust: 
Airborne Reactions 
More fear than actual peanut dust swirls through the air concerning airborne
peanut reactions. As I explain in Chapter 3, many people think that just sit-
ting in a chair next to a peanut butter sandwich can cause a severe reaction.
Although airborne peanut reactions are possible, the risk is actually lower
than you may think. In the following sections, I separate fact from fiction to
calm fears and point out the real dangers.
Ruling out airborne reactions in 
peanut butter and candy bars
Concern over peanut exposure is justified, because peanut is so pervasive,
but only by establishing a realistic risk assessment can you identify the true
risks and let down your guard in low-risk situations. The truth is that an air-
borne peanut reaction from peanut butter, candy bars, and even peanut
butter crackers is very unlikely. Here’s why:
 Peanut butter and candy bars tend to bind the peanut dust with other
stuff like chocolate or caramel, so rarely does a sufficient amount of
peanut protein escape into the surrounding air to cause a reaction.
79
Chapter 4: Picking On Peanuts: A Potentially Deadly Foe

 Even though you can smell the peanut from these foods, evidence shows
that the odor emanating from peanut butter or candy bars does not con-
tain the protein that could cause a reaction when someone handles or
eats these foods.
You could experience an airborne peanut reaction if the peanut eater was in
your face, talking and laughing, and essentially spraying small droplets of
peanut at you. Aside from this kind of situation, however, the risk is nearly
negligible and identifying cases of peanut reactions from this kind of expo-
sure is very difficult. 
Designating peanut-free zones
Is your child’s lunchroom permeated with peanut? Does your child need to
sit at a peanut-free table? Should the entire school ban peanuts of any kind
from the premises? These are all valid questions, but you can safely say that
we have no universally correct answers to these questions. Parents, stu-
dents, and school administrators often hold opposing views. Even different
doctors can be in total disagreement.
I’m quite certain that prior to 1990, the peanut-free table was unheard of.
Considering peanut-free tables since then has often been thought to be bor-
derline un-American. Now peanut-free tables are the norm in most schools,
and some schools ban peanut products altogether. So who’s right? Following
is the approach I recommend:
 Designate peanut-free zones up to the third or fourth grade.
Preschool-age children are much more likely to be tempted to share
food, to have lots of peanut on their hands, and have difficulty keeping
their hands to themselves. As children grow older, these risks lessen. 
 Phase out peanut-free zones in higher grades. I am not convinced that
peanut-free zones provide any additional safety for older students. In
fact, I now write many more letters to get kids out of peanut-free tables
than I do to get kids seated at peanut-free tables. This typically occurs in
older children who have become fed up with being isolated at a peanut-
free table and whose parents accept that the risk of eating at regular
table is incredibly small. 
My recommendations may seem too safe for some and too risky for others.
You, your child, and your school must work together to establish an accept-
able level of safety that keeps kids safe without emotionally isolating them or
preventing them from fully experiencing their school years. Chapters 12 and
13 offer additional guidelines on developing allergen-free policies.

Part I: Feasting on Food Allergy Fundamentals 

Spotting peanuts at bars and restaurants
Among the places where airborne reactions do occur are bars and restau-
rants where peanuts are being served as a snack. In these settings, peanuts
are usually served in the shell, and the process of cracking shells leads to
small amounts of protein becoming airborne, sometimes in high enough con-
centrations to trigger a reaction. This may be a further exacerbated when the
peanut shells accumulate on the floor and patrons and servers kick up the
dust, especially in an enclosed area. 
When you’re allergic to peanuts, you’re best bet is to avoid restaurants and
bars that serve peanuts in their shells, even if that means leaving your
friends behind at the local pub. The worst reactions I’ve seen in these situa-
tions occur when the airborne peanut protein is combined with large doses
of alcohol and denial, so that the reaction gets out of hand before the person
experiencing the reaction has a chance (or inclination) to leave. Otherwise,
simply leaving the area usually leads to a rapid cessation of symptoms, espe-
cially when combined with medication. 
Mixing peanuts with baseball
What would a baseball game be without shelled peanuts? For someone who
suffers from peanut allergy, the game would be a heck of a lot more enjoy-
able. By the third or fourth inning, the stadium floor is carpeted in peanut
shells, and people with peanut allergies often begin to spend more time look-
ing at the exit signs than at the scoreboard.
In the open-air venue of a baseball field, however, the risk of an airborne
peanut reaction is relatively low. In fact, most people with peanut allergy
experience no symptoms in an outdoor stadium, even when surrounded by a
crowd of peanut shelling fans.
So, can you safely take Junior to see his favorite baseball team in action?
Well, that depends on whether Junior is old enough to sit in his seat and
enjoy the game. Taking young children who are prone to picking up things off
the ground, including every peanut shell in sight, is just not worth it.
Steering Clear of the Other Nuts
Unlike peanuts, which are really legumes (in the bean family), tree nuts are
really nuts. Tree nuts include almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazel nuts, hick-
ory nuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios, and walnuts. As
opposed to peanuts, which grow in the ground, tree nuts, as their name
implies, grow on trees. 
81
Chapter 4: Picking On Peanuts: A Potentially Deadly Foe

In food allergy circles, most people lump together peanuts and tree nuts.
Botanically speaking, associating peanuts with tree nuts is absurd. Allergically
speaking, however, the association makes a lot of sense. Following is a list of
similarities:
 Like peanuts, tree nuts can cause severe allergic reactions. 
 Tree nuts are capable of causing severe reactions with minute exposures. 
 Peanuts and tree nuts tend to travel in the same circles — baked goods,
ethnic foods, candies, and ice creams are the most common causes of
accidental tree nut exposures.
 Tree nut oils and extracts all contain the allergenic proteins, so you
must avoid the oils and extracts, too.
In studies of fatal food allergic reactions, tree nuts rank second only to peanuts.
Even though tree nuts and peanuts are botanically unrelated, people with
tree nut allergy often have peanut allergy, and vice versa. Several studies
show that 30 to 40 percent of people with peanut allergy also develop tree
nut allergy. We allergists used to struggle to explain the link between peanut
and tree allergy, and we thought it was most likely due to the fact that
peanuts and tree nuts are both just very potent allergens. New research, how-
ever, has uncovered actual structural similarities between peanut protein and
many of the tree nut proteins.
At this point, you’re probably wondering, “If I have a peanut allergy, should I
avoid tree nuts?” The short answer is “Yes.” For a longer answer, discuss with
your doctor the pros and cons of avoiding tree nuts. In my clinic, we recom-
mend that patients with peanut allergy avoid tree nuts for the following three
reasons: 
 Peanuts and tree nuts are all too often processed together or at least
near enough to one another to pose sufficient risk. 
 Manufacturers often use peanuts as a substitute for tree nuts, because
peanuts are cheaper.
 In young children with peanut allergy, staying away from tree nuts may
help prevent the child from developing a tree nut allergy.
For those with a tree nut allergy, many forms of peanut can be safe, especially
major brand peanut butter and some candies. Be careful though; dry roasted
peanuts are often tree-nut contaminated, and a gourmet peanut butter may
have shared equipment with almond or cashew butter. In my clinic, we
encourage patients with tree nut allergy to avoid peanuts, as well, generally
for the same reasons we tell our peanut-allergic patients to avoid tree nuts.

W
hen you can’t eat without breaking out in hives, having your ears puff
up like muffins, or getting the collywobbles, obtaining an accurate
diagnosis can calm your anxieties. I’m not saying that being diagnosed with 
a food allergy is cause to celebrate, but diagnosis is the first step to relief.
In this chapter, you take the first step on your diagnostic journey by complet-
ing a self-screening test. Although this test isn’t intended to be a self-diagnosis,
it can assist you in deciding whether you need to visit your family physician or
an allergist for a more thorough workup. The self-screening test also guides
you through the process of logging information that can be very useful in your
diagnosis.
With your self-screening test in hand, you and your doctor can then embark
on your search for the offending food(s). To assist you, I provide plenty of
guidance and tips on how to team up with your family physician (or pediatri-
cian) and allergist to more effectively determine if you do, in fact, have a food
allergy, and (if you do) expedite the process of identifying the food(s) that ail

you without overly restricting your diet. I also show you the sorts of allergy
tests and other diagnostic routines you can expect, so you won’t be taken off
guard by any of your doctor’s recommendations. 
In this chapter, I refer to many of the common symptoms of food allergy. For a
more complete discussion of symptoms and possible causes, check out
Chapter 2.
Taking a Flyover View of 
the Diagnostic Journey
The path from the point at which you feel ill to the point at which you receive
a diagnosis and treatment plan can be a long and winding road. To assist you
in navigating that path, check out this eye-in-the-sky overview of the diagnos-
tic process:
1. Your general practitioner (GP) performs a physical exam and jots
down your medical history. The history is critical in ruling out other
possibilities, identifying the likely problem foods, determining which
tests are most appropriate, and guiding the interpretation of test results.
See “Taking a Trip to Your General Practitioner.”
2. Your GP refers you to an allergist. An allergist, particularly one with
experience in diagnosing and treating food allergies, can perform addi-
tional tests and is usually more qualified to interpret the test results. See
“Seeking an Allergist’s Advice.”
3. Your allergist performs a complete food allergy workup. Like your GP,
your allergist is likely to perform a physical exam and take additional
notes about your medical history. Your allergist is likely to perform sev-
eral tests to identify the problem food(s) and rule out suspects that are
not involved:
• Skin tests: Skin testing is used only in the diagnosis of IgE-medi-
ated food allergies — allergies in which your immune system pro-
duces IgE antibodies to a specific food. An allergy specialist (rather
than your GP) should perform the tests, because of both the risk of
anaphylaxis and the skill required to properly interpret the results.
A positive skin test to a particular food indicates only the possibil-
ity that you’re allergic to that food. Your allergist may need to per-
form additional tests to confirm that eating the food causes you to
react. In contrast, a negative skin is about 90 percent accurate in
86
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

determining that you’re not allergic to the tested food. See “Poking
around with skin tests,” for details.
• RASTs: Short for radioallergosorbent tests, RASTs look for the pres-
ence of food-specific IgE in the blood. These tests are widely avail-
able and are unaffected by the presence of medications. In at least
one study, RASTs have proven very effective in diagnosing several
of the major food allergies in children. RAST results show the con-
centration of IgE in the blood, and we have established RAST levels
that can predict with about 95 percent accuracy whether a child is
allergic to egg, milk, peanut, tree nut, or fish. A child with a test
result exceeding the established value, in combination with a posi-
tive skin test, does not require food challenge for definitive diagno-
sis. See “Hunting for IgE with RASTs,” later in this chapter.
• Food diary: Your allergist may ask you to keep a food diary listing
the foods you eat and drink and recording any reactions to those
foods. A food diary can be useful in identifying overlooked foods,
hidden ingredients, and patterns of reactions. See “Preparing to
have your history taken,” later in this chapter.
• Diagnostic elimination diet: Your allergist may order you to stop
eating one or more foods to see if symptoms disappear, which
would identify the problem foods. The allergist needs to pay care-
ful attention to nutrition whenever removing an essential food
from the diet of a growing child. See “Discovering your allergens 
by avoiding them,” later in this chapter.
• Food challenges: A food challenge consists of eating the problem
food under your allergist’s supervision. Results of a food challenge
provide the most definitive data for diagnosing a food allergy. Your
allergist will select foods for testing based on the history and the
results of skin and/or RASTs. Only a qualified allergist who’s famil-
iar with food-allergy reactions and is equipped with the necessary
emergency medications should perform a food challenge. See
“Daring a food to make you react: Food challenges,” later in this
chapter.
4. Your GP and allergist may order additional tests if symptoms persist.
You may have a non-IgE mediated food allergy, as discussed in “Pursuing
the causes of non-IgE mediated allergies,” later in this chapter, or you
may have a food intolerance (see “Ruling out food intolerances,” later in
this chapter).
The journey from problem to solution often requires time, patience, and 
persistence. Don’t try to take a shortcut by reaching for untested, unproven
alternative tests and treatments. See “Avoiding the untested and unproven,”
later in this chapter, for details.

Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis

Self-Screening for Food Allergies 
Funny thing about people in general (specifically men) — they don’t like
going to the doctor. They often prefer to tough it out, hope it goes away, or
convince themselves that the doctor “can’t do anything” rather than seek
immediate medical care. With food allergies, however, avoiding the doctor
can be dangerous, because the longer you tough it out without an accurate
diagnosis, the more likely your reactions are going to increase both in fre-
quency and severity. 
Allergic reactions begin and intensify with increased exposure to allergenic
foods. Early diagnosis and an effective treatment plan can not only make you
feel better now but also prevent you from feeling much worse down the road.
If you or a loved one is experiencing mysterious symptoms, particularly a
couple minutes to a couple hours after consuming food or beverages, you
may have a food allergy. Complete the self-screening test, shown in Figure 5.1.
This self-screening test serves three very important purposes:
 Assists you in deciding whether you need to see your doctor or allergist.
(If you have any doubt after completing the test, see your doctor anyway.)
 Provides you with a log of symptoms and other concrete details that you
can present to your doctor or allergist, which may be key to an accurate
and early diagnosis.
 Hones your observation and record-keeping skills, which are two of the
most valuable skills for any person who has a food allergy or is caring
for someone with a food allergy.
This self-screening test is not a self-diagnosis. Identifying specific allergens is
tricky, even for a well-trained and experienced allergist, and you may be aller-
gic to multiple foods. In addition, other conditions can produce symptoms
similar to those of allergic reactions. Use the self-screening test only as a tool
to facilitate a professional medical diagnosis and treatment.

Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis

Taking a Trip to Your General
Practitioner
When you first suspect that you have any health problem, the first doctor
you typically go to see is a general practitioner (GP for short) — your family
physician, pediatrician, or internist. In the following sections, I reveal how a
GP can and cannot help you with food allergies, when and how to request a
referral to a food allergist, and how to avoid quacks who promise everything,
deliver little or nothing, and often discourage you from seeking effective
treatment.
Why see your GP?
In the case of food allergy, seeing your GP first is a good idea for several 
reasons:
 Your GP possesses a breadth of knowledge and training that’s often
useful in identifying not only food allergies, but also other conditions
that may produce similar symptoms.
 The GP can coordinate the oversight and management of all your health-
care needs, not only your concerns about allergies.
 Your GP often has access to your entire health history and may be able
to spot patterns in your family history that make certain conditions
more likely than others.
 Your health insurance may require you to see your “primary care physi-
cian” (your GP) before approving your visit to a specialist.
 Your GP can refer you to a qualified food allergist, often one that’s in the
same insurance network and perhaps in the same office complex.
Knowing what to expect from your GP
Some GPs know quite a bit about food allergies. Pediatricians may even know
a bit more, because food allergy is most common in young children. So what’s
your GP supposed to do? In the following sections, I describe the standard
care you can expect from your GP. If you’re not receiving a standard level of
care, express your expectations to your GP. If you’re still not satisfied, you
may need to look for another doctor.
90
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

Most patients love their GP’s and are satisfied with the general care they pro-
vide, but the number one complaint I hear from patients is this: “How could
my doctor (pediatricians included) have been so ignorant about food allergy?”
Many patients report symptoms of food allergy to their GP’s for years before
their GP’s take the reports seriously. (GP’s generally take reports of severe
reactions seriously and refer patients to an allergist immediately, but they 
frequently miss the signs of more subtle reactions.)
Recording your history and equipping you for potential emergencies
The least your GP should do is ask you a lot of questions, record a detailed
history of symptoms and what makes them better or worse, and determine
the likelihood that you’re at risk for severe or life-threatening reactions —
that is, whether you may have an IgE-mediated allergy, as described in
Chapter 2. If your doctor suspects that you have an IgE-mediated allergy, she
will likely take the following steps:
 Identify suspected food(s) to avoid until you can get in to see the allergist.
 Refer you to an allergist.
 Hand you a prescription for autoinjector, such as an EpiPen or Twinject,
as a precaution in the event that you experience a future anaphylactic
reaction. (See Chapter 10 for details on getting your emergency kit
together.)
To err on the side of safety, assume that the next reaction is going to be more
severe than the previous reaction and equip yourself to deal with it. Just
because a child developed hives only on her face during her first reaction to
milk or egg, you can’t assume that the next reaction is going to be of a com-
parable intensity. 
Initiating allergy testing
Your GP may or may not decide to initiate allergy testing. Very few GP’s have
the training or materials to perform skin tests, but any doctor can perform
blood testing for allergies (see “Hunting for IgE with RASTs,” later in this
Chapter). RAST (radioallergosorbent test) results can be very helpful in prov-
ing that the suspect food really triggered your reaction. However, searching for
culprit foods with extensive panels of tests — that is, by ordering tests for hun-
dreds of foods — is usually a huge waste of time and money and risks returning
a number of false positive tests which only complicates the diagnosis.
Tracking down other potential causes
If your doctor doesn’t suspect an IgE-mediated allergy, then she should
attempt to determine whether the reaction represented some other type of
food allergy or a nonallergic food reaction (a food intolerance, as explained in
91
Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis

“Ruling out food intolerances,” later in this chapter). The diagnosis and man-
agement of non-IgE-mediated food allergy often requires the assistance of a
gastroenterologist as well as an allergist. In some cases, the history may be
insufficient for discerning the cause of a particular reaction. This is most
often the case with patients who have isolated gastrointestinal symptoms. In
such instances, your GP should arrange for further evaluation and proceed as
if the reaction were IgE-mediated, including equipping you with epinephrine if
suspicion is sufficiently high.
Advising you until further notice
Based on your history and any test results, your GP should tell you which
foods to avoid until further evaluation. Your doctor should carefully interpret
the RASTs, since you can often test positive for safe foods, and you don’t
want to be saddled with an overly restrictive diet. In some cases, a GP orders
RASTs but is not fully competent in interpreting the results. Have your RAST
results forwarded to the allergist you decide to see.
When you’re on an extremely restrictive diet, meeting your nutritional needs
can be tough, especially for infants and children. If your doctor prescribes
extreme restrictions, he’s likely to refer you to a nutritionist, as well. If he
doesn’t refer you, request a referral, as explained in the section, “Navigating
the referral process,” below.
Navigating the referral process 
You visited your GP, she took a detailed history, told you that you probably
were suffering from a food allergy, and referred you to an allergist. Good for
you. You’re now on your way to a more thorough workup and can skip ahead
to the section, “Teaming up with your allergist for optimum results.” If, on the
other hand, your GP offers no reasonable alternative diagnosis or effective
treatment and is reluctant to refer you to an allergist, you may have to crank
your efforts up a notch:
 Ask your GP if she thinks the symptoms could be symptoms of food
allergy. Sometimes, this is enough to lead a GP on the right path.
 State the reasons why you suspect food allergy. Use your powers of
persuasion to convince your GP that food allergy is a possibility and that
a specialist can help confirm your suspicions or rule them out.
 Request a referral. If your insurance plan requires a written referral
from your GP in order to cover your visit to a specialist, your goal is to
walk out of your doctor’s office with a referral. (See the following side-
bar, “Referrals past and present,” for details.) Don’t be shy, and don’t
take no for an answer.
92
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

 Call your insurance company. Look on the back of your insurance card
for a toll-free number. Following are some guidelines and talking points: 
• Always write down the name of the insurance company’s represen-
tative you talked with, the date and time, and specifically what the
person told you.
• Ask if your policy requires referrals (some don’t). You may be able
to see an allergist without your GP’s referral. If your plan doesn’t
require a referral, the cost of seeing an allergist is typically the
same as it would be if you had a referral; you’d have to make a 
co-pay out of pocket.
• Ask what happens if you see an allergist without a referral or one
who’s not in the insurance company’s network. Your policy may
not cover out-of-network doctors or cover a lower percentage of
the cost than if you were to see an in-network specialist with a
referral from your GP.
 See a food allergist without your doctor’s referral or your insurance
company’s approval. This is usually the most costly option, because
your insurance company may not pay any of the cost. 
If you have to pay out of pocket for tests and treatments, mention this to
your doctor. Doctors are human beings who are well aware of the high-cost of
medical care. They may offer you a discount or be willing to set up a reason-
able payment plan and will often be willing to charge you what they would
normally get back from the insurance company (an average of a 36 percent
discount).
93
Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis
Referrals past and present
In the not-so-good-old days, health insurance
companies often set strict limitations on refer-
rals. Sometimes they penalized GPs for sending
too many patients to specialists or offered
rewards to GPs who issued fewer referrals. (In
the real old days, prior to 1990, GP’s didn’t need
to worry about this nonsense.) Fortunately, most
insurance companies have ended their
Draconian policies and now give their doctors
carte blanche to make as many referrals as
necessary. Some companies don’t even require
referrals, so patients are free to see whichever
doctor they deem most helpful.
If your GP seems reluctant to refer you to an
allergist, don’t be quick to blame your insurance
company. In most cases, your GP’s reluctance
is based more on the fact that your GP really
does not believe that you have a food allergy. If
your doctor is unwilling to assist you in obtain-
ing a referral to an allergist, become more
proactive. Contact an allergist yourself, and see
if your allergist can obtain the insurance
approval you need.

GPs often have the mistaken notion that allergists can’t perform allergy tests
on children until they’re two or three years old. This is clearly wrong. The
consensus of food allergists is that the GP should make the referral as soon
as possible after concerns of food allergy arise, even in a two- or three-
month-old. The medical community has plenty of evidence that early diagno-
sis and treatment greatly benefit children and their families.
Avoiding quackologists
Alternative therapies for food allergies abound. Chiropractors, nutritionists,
acupuncturists, and a variety of other alternative practitioners claim the abil-
ity to diagnose and treat food allergies. Some of these healthcare providers
may even be quite knowledgeable about food allergies and beneficial in your
care. Other practitioners who are more on the fringe or way out there, tout
their snake-oils, magic potions, crystals, and other treatments that range
from entertaining diversions to dangerous delusions.
Don’t fall for pumped-up promises of miracle cures. Seek well-trained, quali-
fied medical practitioners to diagnose and manage your food allergies. If you
do decide to pursue alternative routes — a chiropractor with an interest in
food allergy, for example — I always advise that you see a traditional allergist
as well. For details about the most common quack tests and treatments, skip
to Chapter 8.
Seeking an Allergist’s Advice
Your doctor decided to call in an allergist, or you decided on your own to
pursue this option. Now you’re in the market for a top-notch allergist. But
what exactly qualifies an allergist as top-notch? Here are the qualities to look
for in an allergist:
 Training and experience with diagnosing and treating food allergies:
This may seem like a “well, yeah, duh” recommendation, but many aller-
gists are better trained to deal with general allergies, such as allergies to
pollen or pets. Not all allergists are up to speed on food allergies, partic-
ularly in complicated cases.
 Well-honed interpersonal skills: Some allergists are extremely bright
and well-informed but have the interpersonal skills of a manikin or a per-
sonality that clashes with yours. They may take your concerns lightly,
rush you through your visit without answering your questions, or have
some other issues that make for a less than ideal fit.
94
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

In the following sections, I show you how to track down an ideal (or at least
close-to-ideal) allergist and team up with your allergist to obtain the most
accurate diagnosis and most effective treatment plan.
Tracking down a qualified food allergist
Tracking down a local allergist who’s best qualified to diagnose and treat
food allergies is a four-step process:
1. Gather recommendations from your doctor, friends, and family.
2. Ensure that your insurance policy covers the allergists on your list.
3. Verify the allergist’s credentials.
4. Check the allergist’s availability and make an appointment.
The following sections explain each step in greater detail.
Gathering recommendations
Your first recommendation typically comes from your GP. Your GP should be
familiar with the allergists in your area, hopefully knows which allergists have
expertise in food allergy, and may even know who would be the best fit from
a style and personality standpoint. 
If your GP doesn’t recommend a suitable allergist or you want additional
input, ask everyone you know and trust, especially friends and family mem-
bers who’ve already seen an allergist. Ask other doctors if you happen to
know any. These people are often even more capable than your GP in helping
you find the perfect doctor.
If you’re in a food-allergy support group, which isn’t likely at this point because
you’re just getting started, recommendations from fellow members are pure
gold. People often change allergists later based on recommendations from
other members of the group.
Checking insurance coverage
Now that you have a long list of candidates, you can start paring down your
list by crossing off any allergists not covered on your insurance policy. To see
if a particular doctor participates in your insurance network, do one of the
following:
95
Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis

 Call the doctor’s office, provide them with your insurance company’s
name and the network you’re in (almost always printed on the health
insurance card), and ask if the doctor is in your network. Most aller-
gists participate with all the larger insurance companies, so your selec-
tion shouldn’t be overly limited.
 Check the approved provider list supplied by your insurance com-
pany. Many insurance companies offer members a book of approved
healthcare providers, typically grouping providers by location and spe-
cialty. If you don’t have such a book, request one. Your insurance com-
pany may also have a Web site where you can look up the names and
contact information for allergists and other doctors and specialists in
the company’s approved network. 
 As a last resort, try calling the company for additional information,
especially if you lost or misplaced your approved provider list or it’s a
couple years old. A newer list may contain the name of the allergist you
want to see.
Verifying the allergists’ credentials
When your GP refers you to an allergist, ask about the allergist’s credentials
and bedside manner to learn as much as possible about his training and expe-
rience. If your GP is less than forthcoming or you obtained a recommendation
from someone who has little solid information, the following organizations can
help you gather information and can even provide you with additional names
if you’ve come up short after talking to your GP, friends, and family:
 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology
(www.aaaai.org) 
 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (www.acaai.org)
 American Academy of Pediatrics (www.aap.org)
 American Board of Medical Specialties (www.abms.org) 
Other local medical societies may be able to provide additional 
recommendations.
Getting in to see your allergist
Rank the allergists on your list from first choice to last choice based on quali-
fications, reputation, and location, and then start calling around to make an
appointment. Unfortunately, many allergists have a long waiting list, often
several months. If you feel that you can’t wait that long, you may need to go
with your second or third choice.
96
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

Still having trouble getting in to see the allergist? Here are some tips and
tricks from seasoned patients:
 Set up appointments with two or more allergists. When you finally get in
to see one allergist, you can cancel the appointment(s) with the other(s).
Don’t cancel unless you’re happy with the first allergist you see.
 Ask your GP to call the allergist directly to see if she can fit you in
sooner. Your doctors may agree that waiting until the next available
appointment could be dangerous.
 Ask to be placed on the allergist’s cancellation list. If a patient with 
a scheduled appointment calls to cancel, the allergist can give the
appointment to you. My co-author, Joe, who works at home (that lucky
dog), has had great success using this strategy to get his kids in to see
their specialists.
After you see your allergist for the first time and assuming you’re happy with
the allergist, don’t leave the office without setting up at least one appoint-
ment in advance. This can trim your wait time in the future. If you don’t need
the appointment, cancel it a week or so in advance as a courtesy to other
needy patients.
Teaming up with your allergist 
for optimum results
No matter what kind of healthcare issue you have, you get the best results
when you team up with your doctor. To effectively team up with your aller-
gist, here’s what you do:
 Be open and honest. If you smoke or drink alcoholic beverages, for
example, let your allergist know. If you have other health conditions,
even if you think they’re unrelated, inform your allergist. This is no time
to be hiding important details.
 Write down any medications you’re currently taking. Although med-
ications don’t typically trigger allergic reactions, they assist your aller-
gist in painting a more accurate portrait of your condition, and your
allergist needs to know of those medications in order to safely prescribe
other medications.
 Ask questions, even if they seem dumb to you, and express your con-
cerns. Keep those lines of communication open.
 Listen carefully to what your allergist says and follow her advice.
97
Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis

 Keep in touch between appointments either over the phone or via
e-mail, so your allergist is privy to any problems or questions that
arise.
 Work with your allergist to develop an emergency back-up plan, in
writing, in the event that you experience a severe reaction. (Chapter
10 provides additional information on planning and equipping yourself
for emergencies. Check out Chapter 7 for a form you can fill out to get
your emergency action plan in writing.)
Getting the Skinny on Allergy Workups
Diagnosing a food allergy is about as challenging as finding an allergist who
can see you the next day. Your allergist is likely to take a detailed history, per-
form a physical examination, and proceed with a battery of diagnostic tests
to figure out what’s going on and which foods are the prime suspects.
The diagnostic process is more complicated if your food allergy is not IgE-
mediated, since the most common allergy tests — skin tests and RASTs —
both rely on the presence of IgE antibodies. These tests are useless in diag-
nosing non-IgE mediated food allergies. 
In the following sections, I lead you through the diagnostic process step-by-
step, so you know what to expect along the way.
Making the most of your medical history 
Your medical history is of tremendous value in diagnosing food allergy, so
don’t forget to bring the self-screening test you completed in the section
“Self-Screening for Food Allergies,” to your first appointment. In addition to
what you’ve already recorded, your allergist is likely to ask you a series of
probing questions to determine whether true food allergy is likely, and
whether the allergy is likely to be IgE mediated. 
Preparing to have your history taken
You can prepare for the doctor to review your medical history by jotting
down your answers to the following questions: 
 What foods do you suspect you are allergic to?
 At what age did the suspected food allergy begin?
98
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

 What were your specific symptoms?
 What was the timing of the suspected reaction(s)? 
 Did your reaction occur soon after eating the suspect food? 
 Does a reaction always occur when you eat that food?
 Had you previously tolerated that food? How often have you eaten it?
 How much did you eat before you had a reaction? 
 Did anyone else who ate the same food get sick? 
 How was the food prepared? How likely is it that the food had hidden
ingredients?
 Were any medications used to treat the reaction? If medications were
used, which meds were used and were they effective?
 What were you doing prior to or during the time you had the reaction?
Just eating? Exercising? Taking a bath?
 Have similar reactions occurred on prior occasions?
Using your answers to these questions, your allergist formulates your med-
ical history — one of the most important and useful diagnostic tools. Your
allergist may also ask you to keep a food diary to find out even more about
your diet and symptoms in an attempt to identify any consistent pattern to
your reactions.
Investigating your history for clues
Although your history is the most important diagnostic tool, its usefulness
varies depending on the results. Typically, the history leads to one of the fol-
lowing two common scenarios:
 Bingo! The history is precise and virtually diagnoses your specific food
allergy all on its own. If you break out in hives the first time you eat an
egg, for example, it’s pretty obvious that you’re allergic to eggs. In this
case, further testing usually confirms the suspicion.
 I dunno. With more subtle symptoms, especially eczema and some of
the non-IgE mediated gastrointestinal food allergies, reactions may be
quite delayed. You may have had three or four meals and several snacks
before you started feeling ill, making any clear link between cause and
effect very difficult. 
Several studies show that further testing confirms a history of suspected
food allergy only about 30 to 40 percent of the time. Your allergist must inter-
pret your history, including food diaries, with great caution.
99
Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis

Getting physical with a physical exam
You could place a pretty safe bet that by the time you get in to see the aller-
gist, your symptoms will have magically disappeared. Your allergist asks to
see the hives, and your skin is perfectly clear. Your tummy, which was as
bloated as a beach ball two days ago, is as flat as an ironing board today.
Even your sinuses are clear.
Even so, your allergist is going to perform a physical exam to look for signs 
of a possible food allergy, such as eczema and other rashes and symptoms of
other allergic reactions, such as hay fever. What does hay fever have to do
with food allergies? Well, food allergy is more likely to occur in those who
have other types of allergy, and this can be an important clue.
The physical exam, in and of itself, is not always conclusive. Your exam may
reveal no abnormalities, even if you have severe reactions to multiple foods.
After all, the only good thing about food allergy is that you usually look and
feel fine as long as you’re abstaining from the problem foods. One important
bit of information a normal exam provides is that it reassures you and your
allergist that you’re probably okay with your current diet. 
Poking around with skin tests
Once your allergist commences testing, you may begin to wonder if you mis-
takenly stepped into the acupuncturist’s office. Allergists commonly perform
skin-prick tests in which they poke or scratch the skin with an extract of the
suspect food and observe any reactions on the surface of the skin. Your aller-
gist may use any of the following three methods:
 The allergist places a tiny drop of food extract on the skin and pricks the
skin through the drop with a small needle or plastic probe.
 Using a pricking device soaked in the food extract, the allergist pricks
the skin.
 The allergist inserts a small amount of the food extract into the skin
using a small needle. This method, called intradermal skin test, is rarely,
if ever, indicated for food allergy diagnosis. 
A positive skin test results in a mosquito bite-like reaction at the site of the
test within minutes, indicating the presence of histamine, which causes the
skin to swell. After 10–15 minutes, your allergist takes a reading and com-
pares all tests to a control prick (to test your reaction to salt water, which
100
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

shouldn’t cause a reaction). A larger reaction — a larger bump on your skin —
typically shows an increased likelihood that you’re allergic to the tested food.
Guesstimating the number of pin pricks
How many times can you expect to get poked? If you’re presenting symptoms
of a nonfood allergy, such as hay fever or asthma, your allergist performs a
fairly standard set of tests consisting of 20 to 40 skin pricks. 
With food allergy the number of tests is typically based on patient history, so
you can’t expect a set number. An allergist usually performs skin prick tests
for only suspect foods. If you’ve had only one reaction to milk, for example,
your allergist is likely to test only for milk to confirm suspicions. If the his-
tory identifies no particular problem food — you have eczema, for instance,
but no specific food reactions — then, your allergist is likely to test for only
the five or six most common food allergens, including milk, egg, soy, wheat,
and peanut.
Be cautious of any allergist who recommends dozens of tests for food aller-
gies. A few allergists out there routinely test every patient who walks into
their office for 120 different foods, even if they have no reason to suspect a
food allergy. Studies show that in children with eczema, if the skin prick tests
or RASTs results are negative for the most common food allergens, the chil-
dren are highly unlikely to be allergic to less common allergens.
Acknowledging the challenges of interpreting skin tests
Interpreting a skin test seems like a snap. Either it’s positive or negative.
What’s so tricky about that? Actually, it’s tougher than it sounds.
The easiest result to interpret is when the test is completely negative. When
you test negative for a particular food, the likelihood that you have an IgE-
mediated reaction to that food is next to nothing. The main exceptions occur
in babies in the first six to nine months of life, during which time occasional
false negatives occur. 
Skin tests are positive only if you have IgE antibodies to the food being tested.
Skin tests do not detect non-IgE mediated allergies.
Interpreting positive food skin test results is more problematic. Positive tests
indicate that IgE is present but do not, without confirmation from other
sources, prove that a reaction will occur when you eat the food. In other
words, the test can show a positive result or a false positive (a skin reaction
even though you don’t react to the food when you eat it). False positives
occur in the following scenarios:
101
Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis

 You have a small amount of IgE antibody to a food but are not be truly
allergic to that food. You can eat the food and experience absolutely no
reaction to it. 
 Some proteins in foods are cross-reactive with similar proteins in other
foods or even environmental allergens like pollens. This cross reactivity
can lead, for example, to a falsely positive skin test for soy in a person
with peanut allergy, or a positive test to wheat in a person with grass
pollen allergy. See the next section, “Accounting for cross reactivity,” for
details.
Take the results of skin tests with a dose of salt. Overall, up to 60 percent of
all positive food skin tests turn out to be incorrect (falsely positive) upon fur-
ther evaluation. Some studies show that the larger the skin test (the bigger
the bump on your skin at the site of the test), the more likely a true allergy is
at work, although this has not proven true in other studies. Skin test results
are only one component of the diagnostic picture, allergists should evaluate
them carefully and in the context of the big, clinical picture, as demonstrated
in the following sidebar.
Accounting for cross reactivity
Cross-reactivity can occur when your immune system confuses one protein
for another one. This typically happens with members of the same food
family, but can occur between two allergens you may not imagine are related.
A person who’s allergic to tree pollen, for example, may not be able to eat
apples or cherries. Someone who’s allergic to ragweed may be sensitive to
cantaloupe or banana. 
Allergists remain vigilant of cross reactivity for two reasons:
 Cross-reactivity can often provide clues to other foods you may be aller-
gic to or may become allergic to in the future.
 Cross-reactivity can thoroughly confuse test results. 
When evaluating skin tests, your doctor needs to be aware of the possibility
of cross reactivity, because the test may return a false positive result for a
food you can safely eat.
Weighing the minor risks of skin tests
Allergy skin testing is generally a very safe procedure. However, because it
exposes you to a food that you may be highly allergic to, caution is always in
order. An occasional patient may in fact be considered too allergic for admin-
istering a safe skin test. Incidence of systemic (whole body) reactions, how-
ever, are very low — estimates run at about 30 reactions per 100,000 tests.
102
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

Only allergists trained in the treatment of severe allergic reactions should
perform skin tests, just in case you experience a severe reaction. Your aller-
gist must have emergency equipment and drugs on hand for the treatment 
of anaphylaxis whenever performing a skin test. Chapter 2 provides more
detailed information on anaphylaxis.
Hunting for IgE with RASTs 
Another test that requires a needle is the RAST, a test that measures the
amount of allergen-specific IgE in your blood. This test doesn’t require an
allergist; your GP can perform the test, but an allergist may be more qualified
to interpret the results and is usually the doctor who performs the test. RAST
consists of drawing a small amount of blood and then having the blood
tested — by sending it out to a lab. Doctors can perform RASTs for almost
any food or airborne allergen. 
103
Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis
Confirming the results with other clues
Skin tests alone rarely prove much of anything.
In a single week, I saw three patients, all of
whom were diagnosed with egg allergy and
came to me for a second opinion. Each had
tested positively and had reactions of similar
size to egg. Their cases illustrate the complexi-
ties of interpreting skin tests:
 Patient 1: The first patient had experienced
two severe allergic reactions after eating
scrambled eggs. In this case, the skin test
confirmed the history and the diagnosis of
egg allergy was virtually certain. This
patient must avoid eating eggs.
 Patient 2: The second patient (a child) had
severe eczema and was eating eggs regu-
larly. He had never experienced an appar-
ent reaction to egg and no evidence linked
the eczema to a particular food in his diet.
Since about 40 percent of children with
severe eczema have underlying food
allergy, and since egg allergy is the most
common food allergy in children with
eczema, this patient requires additional
tests, as explained later in this chapter, to
determine whether he is truly allergic to egg
or not. 
 Patient 3: The third patient was being eval-
uated for seasonal hay fever, and his aller-
gist performed food tests for no particular
reason. He eats eggs regularly and has
never had any difficulty. Yet, his allergist told
him to strictly avoid eggs, solely because he
tested positive to egg. In this patient the his-
tory won. My colleagues and I felt safe
assuming that the skin test produced a false
positive result and that the patient could
safely resume eating eggs. 

The most important point about RASTs is that they’re not all the same. Some
types of RASTs are more accurate than others, and the results of one type 
of RAST are not interchangeable with the results of another type. For diag-
nosing food allergies, the type of RAST that has the best track record is the
Pharmacia CAP fluorescent enzyme immunoassay. Wrap your mouth around
that one! To simplify the nomenclature, doctors refer to this type of RAST as
CAP-FEIA or CAP-RAST.
As with skin testing, negative RAST results are quite accurate in ruling out an
IgE-mediated food allergy, but positive RAST results do not necessarily mean
you have a true food allergy. False positive results occur with RASTs for the
very same reasons they occur with skin testing. However, because the RAST
is more of a true measure of the amount of IgE in your system, differentiating
a true positive test from a false positive test is generally easier than it is in
the case of skin tests. 
When your doctor gets the results, she looks at your RAST score and inter-
prets the results based on the following criteria:
 The higher the RAST score, the more likely that the results represent a
true food allergy. 
 More importantly, for some of the most common food allergens, the
doctor may compare your RAST levels to predetermined cut-offs, above
which a true food allergy is almost certain. For example, using the CAP-
RAST, which gives results on a scale from 0 (zero) to 100, an IgE level of
more than 7 to egg, over 15 to milk, 14 to peanut, and 20 to codfish is
highly predictive (greater than a 95 percent chance) that you’re allergic
to that food. 
Your doctor can often use RAST results to track your levels of specific IgE
antibodies over time. RAST levels that decrease over time are an excellent
indication that you’re outgrowing your allergy to a particular food. My col-
leagues and I typically decide when to try to re-introduce a food into a
patient’s diet based on the RAST result. (See Chapter 15 for details about 
outgrowing food allergies.)

RAST terminology defined
RAST (short for radioallergosorbent test) is a
term that actually refers to an older test method,
one that allergists rarely use any more. The term
stuck, however, and doctors still commonly the
term to describe all the test methods that 
measure specific IgE antibodies in the blood. A
more accurate term would be immunoassay for
specific IgE but I use RAST throughout the book,
because it’s more common and a heck of a lot
easier to type.

Weighing the pros and cons 
of RASTs and skin tests
As you probably realized by now, neither skin tests nor RASTs are the perfect
tests. Results can range from highly successful at best, to inconclusive, to
misleading at worse. When discussing with your doctor which test would be
most useful in your case, weigh the pros and cons of each.
Skin tests have a couple advantages over RASTs:
 A skin test is cheap.
 Skin test results are available almost immediately.
 Skin tests generally produce fewer false negatives. However, in food
allergy testing, false negatives are uncommon with either test method,
so this is not a huge issue.
RASTs have several advantages over skin testing: 
 Certain medications, such as antihistamines, can interfere with skin test-
ing, so you have to stop the medication beforehand. If you have trouble
stopping your antihistamines, a RAST is an attractive alternative.
 Widespread skin conditions, especially hives or severe eczema, may pre-
clude accurate skin testing.
 RASTs are less risky for patients who are susceptible to severe 
anaphylaxis.
 RASTs may be better at discerning a true positive from a false positive
test.
 RASTs provide more information on the progress of an allergy over time.
Neither skin-test nor RAST results are very good at predicting the type or
severity of an allergic reaction. Although higher RAST levels generally indi-
cate more severe reactions, numerous exceptions prevent RAST results from
functioning as accurate predictors of a future reaction. This is due in part to
the dose effect described in Chapter 3, but even with the same dose (amount
of a problem food) three people with the same skin-test or RAST result may
have hugely different reactions with exposure to the food. One person may
eat peanuts regularly without symptoms, the second may experience minor
hives, and the third may experience severe anaphylaxis.

Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis

Looking for Clues with Additional
Diagnostic Tools
You’ve been interviewed, examined, and poked, and your allergist can pro-
vide you with no definitive diagnosis. It happens, especially when you’re
experiencing delayed reactions. Hope, however, remains. Your doctor has
some additional tricks up his sleeve, including both eating the food (a food
challenge) and not eating the food (an elimination diet). The following sec-
tions present additional diagnostic tools that can dig below the skin to
unearth more mysterious causes.
Daring a food to make you react: 
Food challenges
When your allergies prove too elusive for skin tests and RASTs, your doctor
may try to dare the allergies out of hiding by challenging them to react to 
suspect foods. This test, commonly called an oral food challenge, consists 
of feeding you increasing amounts of the suspect food under your doctor’s
supervision, while observing you for symptoms. Food challenges are consid-
ered the only foolproof test for most food allergies. In addition to identifying
elusive allergies, food challenges serve three useful purposes:
 Verify the accuracy of a positive skin test or RAST.
 Determine if a patient has outgrown an allergy. 
 Diagnose cases of non-IgE-mediated reactions. An oral challenge may
be the only definitive way to diagnose a non-IgE mediated food allergy.
Don’t try this at home. Food challenges carry a risk of serious reactions. Only
trained personnel with emergency treatment immediately available should
perform these tests.  
Your doctor can choose to perform a food challenge using either of the fol-
lowing three methods:
 Instruct you to eat the suspect food in increasing doses while observ-
ing you for signs of a reaction. (With this method, unlike the following
two methods, you know what you’re eating.) This is the most common
way to do a food challenge.
 Have you to eat something that contains the suspect food without your
knowing that you’re eating the suspect food. Your doctor mixes sam-
ples of the offending food with another food or adds it as an ingredient
to another food, so you can’t recognize it by sight, smell, or taste. 
106
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

 Have you swallow a capsule containing the allergen. In some cases,
the doctor uses placebo tablets, as well, to keep you in the dark about
whether you’re eating the suspect food or some inert substance. 
The ideal way to perform a food challenge test is to do a “double-blind,
placebo-controlled challenge.” With this method, neither the allergist nor the
patient is aware of which capsule or food contains the suspected allergen. In
order for the test to be effective, you must also take capsules or eat food that
does not contain the allergen (placebos). This ensures that any observed reac-
tion is due to the allergen and not some other factor, such as stress or anxiety.
Discovering your allergens 
by avoiding them
When you eat something and it makes you sick, the logical thing to do is stop
eating it. This is essentially what you do with an elimination diet. When you
have a food allergy, your doctor often places you on an elimination diet per-
manently, or until you’ve outgrown the allergy (if you do outgrow the allergy),
but doctors often use elimination diets on a temporary basis to diagnose
allergies.
107
Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis
Challenging a food when the time is right
My colleagues and I often struggle to determine
the right time to do a food challenge, especially
to see ifa patient has outgrown an allergy. If a
patient has not experienced any recent reac-
tions (recent reactions would guarantee that
the patient is still allergic), we base most food
challenge decisions on the CAP-RAST IgE level.
If the CAP-RAST IgE level is low enough, we
decide to move forward with a food challenge
to verify that the patient has really outgrown the
allergy.
A few years ago we published our experience
with this method and were able to more clearly
define the IgE levels at which a challenge may
be reasonable. After all, we do not want to take
the risk of a challenge if the odds of success are
too small, but yet don’t want to restrict the diet
more than necessary. In our study, we reported
on 604 food challenges in 391 children to the five
most common food allergens. Our goal was to
establish the IgE level at which we could expect
a 50 percent pass rate, and we determined a
cutoff level of 2 kUA/L (kili-units per liter) for
milk, egg, and peanut. Data were less clear for
wheat and soy where determining a definitive
cut-off was more difficult. We concluded that
IgE concentrations to milk, egg, and peanut and,
to a lesser extent, wheat and soy, serve as
useful predictors of challenge outcome and
should be routinely used when advising patients
about oral challenges to these foods. See
Chapter 15 for additional details on working with
your allergist to determine when conditions are
relatively safe to proceed with a food challenge
to determine if you have outgrown an allergy.

You may have already performed this test on your own by avoiding a particu-
lar food and then re-introducing it to your diet and finding that your symp-
toms returned. If you’ve already done this, your doctor should have included
this piece of information in your history. If you haven’t performed the test
yet, your doctor may recommend it to confirm skin test or RAST results or
simply as a logical next step — “we can’t figure this out so let’s avoid certain
foods and see what happens.”
108
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 
Cracking a tough case
Some patients have extremely challenging food
allergies that defy the detection efforts of even
the most determined and well-trained allergist.
To demonstrate just how challenging the diag-
nostic process can be, I offer a case that typi-
fies the usual patient that I see in my food
allergy clinic on a daily basis:
Kyle is a two-and-a-half-year-old old boy who
had severe eczema in the first weeks of life. His
mother was breast-feeding him at that time, and
he seemed to react to whatever his mother was
eating. He underwent his first allergy testing at
six months of age, and the results showed pos-
itive to milk, egg, and peanut. He was weaned
to a soy formula, which he appeared to tolerate.
By the time he saw me for the first time, he had
been skin tested three more times, each test
picking up more positive results. A detailed diet
history revealed that his only obvious allergic
reactions occurred with exposure to egg and
milk. He had never ingested peanut or tree nuts
and had seemed to tolerate wheat and soy. 
Kyle’s previous doctors told his parents that he
was truly allergic to all the foods to which he
tested positive. By the time I saw him, his diet
was limited to seven foods — rice, apple, pear,
chicken, squash, sweet potato, and carrots.
Although his eczema was now well under con-
trol, he was losing weight and was miserable.
The elimination diet had worked to improve his
eczema and had been helpful, diagnostically
speaking, by showing that his eczema was due
to food allergy, but it had truly put him at risk of
malnutrition. Given the likelihood that many of
his skin test results were falsely positive, I was
hopeful that we could expand his diet.
I began by performing RASTs to a large panel of
foods. With these results we could put the foods
he was avoiding into three categories — almost
definitely allergic, possibly allergic, and almost
certainly not allergic. I felt that the foods in the
last category — almost certainly not allergic —
could be safely introduced at home. We were
able to quickly expand his diet to include sev-
eral major foods, including wheat, soy, and
corn, as well as many new fruits and vegeta-
bles, with no worsening of his eczema. For the
foods in the middle category — possibly 
allergic — I recommended that food challenges
be done to further define his true allergies. This
allowed us to introduce pork, oat, and potato
into his diet. Food challenges to milk and beef
were unsuccessful. For the foods in the first 
category — almost definitely allergic — includ-
ing egg, peanut, tree nuts, sesame, peas, and
fish, I recommended continued strict avoidance. 
At this point, while his diet is still very restricted,
his life and nutrition are both vastly improved.
He will now be retested annually and his diet
hopefully will expand further with time.

An elimination diet typically spans the course of several weeks but consists
of only two steps (plus a step that’s sometimes recommended):
1. Eliminate specific foods and ingredients from your diet, typically over
a period of two to three weeks. During this time, you carefully read
food labels and find out about food preparation methods when you’re
dining out. See Chapter 6 for details about reading labels. Over the
course of the elimination period, your doctor monitors symptoms, all of
which should disappear in three weeks if you’re following the right diet.
2. With your doctor’s okay, you begin to gradually reintroduce the foods
that were eliminated, one at a time, while carefully recording any
symptoms that arise when you partake of each food. If your symptoms
return, your doctor can usually confirm the diagnosis.
3. In some cases, your doctor may direct you to once again eliminate the
remaining suspect foods from your diet to reinforce the diagnosis.
Maybe you’re thinking that elimination diet is just a fancy term for food chal-
lenge, and it sort of is. You eliminate the food and then challenge it. 
The elimination diet is not foolproof, and it can be risky. Psychological and
physical factors can affect the diet’s results. For example, if you think you’re
sensitive to a food, a response could occur that may not be a true allergic
one. And if you’ve experienced severe reactions to certain foods, your doctor
should consider reintroducing the food only in the controlled setting of a
food challenge.
Pursuing the causes of non-IgE 
mediated allergies 
As described in Chapter 1 and elsewhere, some types of allergy involve other
parts of the immune system and are undetectable with the most common
allergy tests — skin tests and RASTs. These are mostly gastrointestinal reac-
tions, although occasionally eczema and other rashes may occur due to non-
IgE mediated food allergies.
In such cases, allergists typically have to fall back on your history, which may
range from tremendously helpful to completely misleading, especially if you
experience delayed reactions or you and your doctor can’t pin down a spe-
cific food. If the history reveals little useful information, your doctor may rec-
ommend one of the following next steps:
109
Chapter 5: Labeling Your Ailments with an Accurate Diagnosis

 The first next step is usually an elimination diet followed by either an
oral food challenge or a gradual re-introduction of the food(s) at home.
 The second diagnostic approach is to perform a biopsy of the esopha-
gus, stomach, or intestine (obtained through a scope by a gastroenterol-
ogist). To obtain the most definitive results, your allergist (with the
assistance of your gastroenterologist) may repeat the scope and biop-
sies after an elimination diet or after you’ve re-introduced the food into
your diet.
Another type of skin testing called patch testing has shown some promise in
the diagnosis of non-IgE mediated food allergy. When used for food reactions,
small amounts of a pure food are placed in tiny cups, which your doctor
tapes to your back. The foods are chosen based on diet, knowledge of
common allergens, and previous reactions. Your doctor removes the patches
after 48 hours and reads them at 72 hours. During the writing of this book, no
standardized reagents, application methods, or guidelines for interpretation
are available, and patch testing is still finding its place in the diagnosis of
food allergy.
Avoiding the untested and unproven
Admittedly, skin tests and RASTs, are less than perfect, but some allergy
tests, often purported to be superior, are untested at best, proven to be
worthless at their worst, and are usually pretty costly (and not covered by
insurance). I commonly see patients who have spent thousands of dollars of
these tests and who have been placed on broad avoidance diets based on
totally inaccurate test results. Remember those quackologists I talked about
earlier in this chapter. They’re typically the misinformed, misguided souls
who mislead their patients with these phony tests. Here’s a list of the most
common dubious tests to watch out for:
 IgG and IgG4 tests
 Sublingual or intradermal provocation tests
 Lymphocyte activation tests
 Kinesiology
 Cytotoxic tests 
 Electrodermal testing
For details about unproven tests and treatments you need to watch out for,
skip to Chapter 8.

Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

Ruling out food intolerances
Certain foods can make you miserable even though you’re not allergic to
them. If your doctor examines your body, your history, and your test results
and rules out food allergy, he may begin to suspect a food intolerance — an
adverse food-induced reaction that does not involve the immune system. 
Lactose intolerance is one example of a food intolerance. If you have a lactose
intolerance, you lack an enzyme (lactase) that’s essential for digesting milk
sugar. In this case, the milk sugar is the culprit. In the case of a milk allergy, a
milk protein is the perpetrator. When a person with lactose intolerance con-
sumes milk products, symptoms such as gas, bloating, and abdominal pain
may occur. Your doctor can perform a specific test for lactose intolerance
called a breath hydrogen test, but for most other food intolerances no specific
diagnostic test is available. 
To diagnose an intolerance to other foods, such as wheat, your doctor is
likely to re-examine the data he’s already collected:
 History: A history that shows a predominance of gastrointestinal symp-
toms and a tolerance of small doses of the food commonly points to
food intolerance. With food intolerance, symptoms typically occur when
you eat larger quantities of the suspect food. While this can occur with
food allergy, allergic reactions tend to occur at much smaller doses than
food intolerances.
 Test results: If your skin tests and RASTs show no signs of food allergy, a
food intolerance may be triggering your symptoms.
Treatment for a food intolerance is very similar to food allergy treatment.
Your doctor is likely to instruct you to avoid the offending foods or at least
limit your consumption. The same food substitutes can often help you vary
your diet without missing the foods you love. In the case of lactose intoler-
ance, your doctor may prescribe lactase supplements to help you digest the
milk sugar.

Concocting Your Own 
Avoidance Diet
In This Chapter
 Setting realistic goals
 Avoiding the foods that ail you
 Deciphering cryptic food labels
 Adjusting your diet to meet your nutritional needs
 Reducing exposure through a rotation diet
A
fter visiting your food allergist, you may feel as though you just stepped
out of an old Henny Youngman joke: Patient tells his doctor, “It hurts
when I do this . . . .” Doctor replies, “Stop doing that.”
Much of the medical advice your allergist offers boils down to just that —
avoid the foods that ail you. If you react to peanuts, stop eating them. If you
break out in hives whenever you eat fish, order the roast beef, instead. If you
get an itchy rash after gulping a glass of milk, stop drinking the stuff.
Ahhhh, if only it were that easy. Unfortunately, it’s not, because people don’t
eat that way, chefs don’t cook that way, and food manufacturers don’t think
that way. People mix and match foods and spices to create an infinite variety
of flavorful foodstuffs. Almost every recipe for a tasty dish calls for several
ingredients. Almost every processed food you find on the shelves contains a
complex combination of constituents.
To further complicate matters, foods commonly go by several pseudonyms
to cloak their true identities. Eggs hide behind labels like “albumin” and “sim-
plesse.” Milk sneaks around as “casein.” Peanuts and soy slip past the guards
under the alias of “hydrolyzed vegetable protein.”

In this chapter, I take you beyond the recommendation to stop eating the
stuff that ails you. I uncover the aliases of common allergens, show you how
to decipher food labels, offer tips on meeting your nutritional needs while
avoiding nutritional foods, show you how to design and manage your own
avoidance diet, and reveal the pros and cons of rotation diets. 
The Cheat Sheet that tears out in the front of this book gives you the Food
Label Crib Sheet. Take it with you while grocery shopping. It helps you deci-
pher those food labels so you can avoid the foods that ail you.
Setting Sensible Goals 
You’ve just learned that you’re allergic to one or more foods and that the
foods can be hiding in the most unsuspected places. At this point, you proba-
bly feel a mix of shock, fear, anxiety, and depression. Your first impulse may
be to resign yourself to a lifetime regimen of rice and water and whatever you
can manage to grow in your vegetable garden. 
I recommend a less radical approach, one that enables you to enjoy a bounti-
ful buffet of foods safely. The first step is to set sensible goals:
 Avoid the foods that ail you without avoiding anything you’re not
truly allergic to. See “Drawing Up Your Avoidance Diet,” below.
 Read and understand food labels. See “Decrypting Food Labels:
Allergen-Savvy Grocery Shopping,” later in this chapter.
 Design a diet that contains a wide variety of foods you love, excludes
your allergens, and enables you to maintain proper nutrition while
retaining your sanity. See “Feeding Your Nutritional Needs,” later in this
chapter.
Don’t overdo it. Anxiety may drive you to avoid more foods than necessary.
An accurate diagnosis can tell you which foods you’re allergic to, giving you a
wider selection of foods you can safely enjoy.
Drawing Up Your Avoidance Diet 
Describing an allergen-free diet as an “avoidance diet” sounds more gloomy
than it really is. Sure, you want to avoid the foods that make you sick, but in
the process, you often discover a cornucopia of cuisine that pleases your
palate and more than satisfies your appetite. Consider creating an avoidance
diet as a quest to discover more exotic foods, to become self-sufficient by
114
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

cooking your own meals, and to wrest control from an illness that has, up to
this point, burdened you with restrictions. Consider it liberating.
Maximizing your choices 
At this point, you should have an accurate diagnosis in hand. If you haven’t
yet obtained a diagnosis, check out Chapter 5. The diagnosis is key, because
it provides you with a list of foods you can’t add to your grocery list. With
your list of forbidden fruits (or nuts, milk, fish, or whatever you’re allergic to)
and the guidance and information provided later in this chapter (on how to
read labels and address your nutritional needs), you’re well equipped to set
out on your quest. 
Your avoidance diet is unique to you and as varied as you choose to make it.
Your goal is to develop a diet with a variety of tasty foods, so that you don’t
miss the foods you love . . . at least not much. With that in mind, here are
some important suggestions to keep you on track and maximize your food
choices:
 Design a diet that’s right for you. Create a list of everything you eat or
would like to eat that contains the food you’re allergic to, and then care-
fully seek substitutes based on age, nutritional needs, and tastes. If you
love cheese, for example, but are allergic to milk, I’m not about to recom-
mend soy cheese, because most soy cheese contains milk protein, and
you may not even find it appetizing. Explore alternatives that you find
appealing. Chapter 18 offers a list of tasty substitutes for some common
allergenic foods.
 Bolster your buffet. When allergies are limiting your choices, fight back
by trying different foods. Just make sure you read the labels carefully
before testing the waters.
 Be resourceful. Your neighborhood grocery store may not be the best
place to explore the multitude of available options. Visit health food
stores, online specialty food stores, and stores like Whole Foods and
Trader Joe’s.
 Hunt for bargains. Healthy foods are typically more pricey than the
highly processed foods that crowd the shelves of most grocery stores,
so if you’re on a tight budget, you may have to adjust your diet accord-
ingly, clip coupons, and hunt for bargains.
 Start cooking. Learning to cook, if you’re not an expert already, can
increase your options tenfold while providing you with a new, rewarding
hobby. By preparing your own meals from scratch, you can eliminate a
host of processed foods from your diet.
115
Chapter 6: Concocting Your Own Avoidance Diet

Determining how strict you need to be
When I recommend an avoidance diet to my patients, one of the first ques-
tions they ask is “How strict do I need to be?” The short, safe answer is that
you need to adhere to the strictest guidelines that you and your doctor
establish. I recommend strict avoidance for two reasons: 
 Strict avoidance limits the risk of reactions. Highly allergic people can
experience allergic reactions, even severe and fatal reactions, when
exposed to minute amounts of the offending allergen. 
 Strict avoidance, especially in young children, may improve your
chances of outgrowing the allergy. (See Chapter 15.)
I recommend strict avoidance of any foods that contain or are at a risk of con-
taining a food that triggers an allergic reaction. However, I realize that all
people are different. Work with your doctor to formulate a plan that ensures
your desired quality of life while minimizing the risks.
Decrypting Food Labels: Allergen-Savvy
Grocery Shopping
When you’re allergic to a food, every trip to the grocery store is like a clan-
destine mission to identify and avoid the enemy. Before you step behind
enemy lines and walk into your local grocery or convenience store, brief
yourself on the following precautionary protocol:
 Know all the ways that manufacturers can label the food you’re avoid-
ing, as revealed in the following sections.
 Read the ingredients on every package, the warnings, and the fine
print.
 Re-read the label every time you buy the product. Ingredients can
change at any time, and the label does not have to announce “new and
improved.”
 Master the oddities of food labeling. For example, “dairy free” has noth-
ing to do with being milk free. “Dairy free” refers to the presence of milk
fat but not milk protein.
 Avoid bulk foods, because they have a higher risk of contamination.
 Beware of the deli counter, especially if you have a milk allergy. The
worker at the meat counter may use the same slicer for meat and cheese. 
116

Going on an egg hunt
When you’re allergic to eggs, a trip to the grocery store can be more challeng-
ing than your typical Easter egg hunt. Food labels hide eggs behind a host of
names, and can show up as glaze on unlabeled bakery items, as clarifying
agents in soups, or as a fat substitute. 
What do you do when you have a recipe that calls for eggs? Provide a substi-
tute. Chapter 18 suggests tasty substitutes for the ten most common foods
that trigger allergic reactions.
Identifying the many faces of milk
Milk morphs into several food products that look nothing like milk, including
cheese, butter, sour cream, yogurt, and pudding. It can also show up in a host
of foods under an assortment of names. 
A peanut by any other name . . .
In the world of food allergies, peanuts are in a class of their own. They’re
extremely allergenic and can cause severe reactions with minimal exposure,
so if you’re allergic to peanuts, you need to avoid foods that have even trace
elements of the offending food. 
117
Chapter 6: Concocting Your Own Avoidance Diet
Making sense of FALCPA
One of the great challenges in avoiding foods
you are allergic to comes from the complexity
of food labels. Unfortunately, foods may show
up on a label under a variety of names.
Fortunately, reading labels is becoming easier
as a result of the Food Allergen Labeling and
Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA), which went
into effect on January 1, 2006. 
FALCPA requires that manufacturers label the
eight most common food allergens — milk, 
egg, peanut, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shell-
fish — in simple, unambiguous terms. Before the
law, manufacturers could label milk as a “natural
flavor” and label wheat as “starch.” Now, man-
ufacturers must call any form of milk “milk” and
any form of wheat “wheat,” usually in bold 
letters. 
This new labeling law has been a major break-
through, but reading labels is still a challenge,
especially for the foods not in the top eight.
“Starch,” for example, may still mean “corn,”
and manufacturers can still call sesame a “nat-
ural flavor.” To obtain reliable details about the
more ambiguous terms, you still may need to
call the manufacturer, or just avoid that product.

Spotting soy and soy products 
Over the years, soybean products have become somewhat of a staple in our
diets and the bane of anyone who has an allergy to it. It can hide in every-
thing from the ubiquitous hydrolyzed vegetable protein to tofu and tamari. 
Studies show that most individuals who have a soy allergy can safely eat soy
lecithin and soy oil, but check with your doctor before you decide to indulge.
Shaking the tree nuts out of a label
Like peanuts, tree nuts can cause severe reactions with minimal exposure. If
you have a tree nut allergy, you’re likely to be allergic to several but not all
tree nuts, but avoidance is most effective if you avoid all tree nuts. 
118
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 
Whipping the milk allergy
The parents of a two-year-old boy with a previ-
ously diagnosed milk allergy came to see me.
They were frustrated beyond belief. When their
son was first diagnosed, they were over-
whelmed by the thought of removing milk form
his diet. After all, he seemed to live on milk,
cheese, and other dairy products. They ven-
tured to the grocery store and were relieved to
find a wide variety of milk substitutes. Within the
first few minutes, they had filled their cart with
lactose-free and dairy-free desserts and soy-
based yogurt and cheese. 
Over the following weeks, they became dis-
mayed that their son continued to have frequent
allergic reactions. They were convinced that he
must be allergic to other foods, so they came to
see me for further advice. After they described
the milk-free products they had purchased, I
immediately knew what was going on. All the
milk substitutes they were feeding their son
contained milk. 
In reality, “lactose-free” indicates that only the
milk sugar (lactose) has been removed; it doesn’t
refer to the milk protein that was triggering their
son’s reactions. Similarly, “dairy-free” refers to
the source of fat in the product and has nothing
to do with milk protein. To make matters worse,
most soy cheeses contain casein, a very potent
form of milk protein, and the soy yogurt had no
milk ingredients but had a big “D” on the front
of the package, indicated a likely milk contami-
nation. Needless to say, the parents were a little
shocked.
I provided the parents with the information they
needed to accurately identify milk on food
labels, which made their trips to the grocery
store considerably more difficult. With a little
practice, however, they became master label
decoders and were overwhelmed with pride
when they conquered the task and their son
miraculously stopped having allergic reactions. 

Recognizing wheat’s many aliases
For most people in the West, wheat is the bread of life. For those who have
wheat allergies, however, wheat and the many food products that contain it
are pesky troublemakers that are tough to spot 
Smelling the fish on a label
When you’ve been diagnosed as having an allergy to fish, your first question
is likely to be: “Which fish? Cod? Salmon? Sturgeon? Freshwater? Saltwater?”
Although all fish are not created equal, most people who have a fish allergy
are allergic to several types of fish, so I generally recommend that if you’re
allergic to one type, avoid them all — both freshwater and saltwater vari-
eties, canned, fresh, sushi, you name it. 
Allergic reactions to fish and shellfish can be severe and are often a cause of
anaphylaxis, so if you’re allergic to fish, be prepared to identify and avoid
them. 
Although canned fish tend to be less of a problem, avoid canned fish, as well,
unless your doctor instructs you that a specific fish is okay for you to eat.
Cracking open mysterious shellfish labels
Shellfish are notorious for triggering severe allergic reactions and even ana-
phylaxis. If you’re allergic to shellfish, you already know to avoid shellfish at
home, but you should also remain aware of any risks from eating out and any
hidden sources of shellfish. 
Sifting out hidden sesame
Sesame is becoming increasingly popular in Western diet and increasingly a
problem for those who are allergic to it. Sesame seeds contain extremely
potent allergens and can cause severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.
Although the sesame allergy gets less press than peanut and shellfish aller-
gies, allergic reactions to sesame can be just as severe. Because sesame is
such a versatile food, it can show up in a host of unsuspected places. 
Sesame can show up in non-sesame products, especially bread, due to cross-
contamination from other bakery items that use sesame.

Approaching Warning 
Labels with Caution
More and more food manufacturers are sticking precautionary labels on their
packaging. You pick up a granola bar, and it says, “May contain peanuts.”
You’d think that the people making the granola bar would know if they put
peanuts in it, but apparently they forgot. More of these precautions are show-
ing up since FALCPA was passed, and I can speculate on only three reasons
for this increase:
 Changes in manufacturing processes have introduced more opportuni-
ties for cross-contamination. (Machines used to produce a food that con-
tains common allergens is used to produce food that doesn’t.)
 Companies are becoming more allergy aware and conscientious in their
labeling.
 Manufacturers are covering their posteriors to adhere to the new laws,
even though FALCPA doesn’t require it, contrary to popular belief.
The problem with these umbrella precautions is that they often and unneces-
sarily increase the anxiety of those who suffer from food allergies, and they
slap additional restrictions on diets. They end up warning consumers of food
items that are perfectly safe and add confusion and uncertainty to a labeling
system that’s sufficiently confusing.
In the following sections, I translate these precautions into plain English,
identify the ones that suggest the greatest risk, and caution you to avoid the
common mistake of assuming that just because you haven’t reacted to a par-
ticular item in the past you won’t react to it this time.
Deciphering the “This package 
may contain . . .” warning
Manufacturers often label products with cryptic precautions, such as “This
product may contain . . .” or “Produced on shared equipment” or “Product
may contain traces of . . . .” These phrases can signal anything from a non-
existent to a serious risk, so you have no choice but to take them seriously.
Such precautions usually indicate that the manufacturer produces more than
one product on a single machine, as described in the following scenarios:
120
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

 Scenario 1: A peanut product and a non-peanut product are produced
on separate equipment, but the company says that if the peanut butter
cookie line breaks down, they could start to make those cookies on the
vanilla cream cookie equipment. This may never happen but the label
appears anyway because of that theoretical possibility. 
 Scenario 2: A peanut and a non-peanut product are produced on the same
equipment but the equipment is thoroughly cleaned before switching
from one product to the other. Some products may be more amenable to
cleaning than others. A liquid food (ice cream is a great example) is quite
easy to clean as long as sufficient care is taken. Dry products (cereals,
crackers, cookies) may be harder to completely remove from machinery. 
 Scenario 3: A peanut and a non-peanut candy are produced on shared
equipment and no cleaning is done between runs. This could be deadly! 
In the end, you can’t truly know what these precautionary words mean, so
you have to avoid any products that contain these vague warnings.
Virtually no ice cream is made on dedicated, peanut-free equipment, but
most ice cream from large manufacturers is likely to be safe, whereas ice
cream from small companies is commonly contaminated, often with no warn-
ing on the label. 
Decoding the “Produced in 
a facility . . .” warning
Slightly less vague than “This package may contain . . .” is any precautionary
label indicating that the product was made in a facility that produces another
product that contains a common allergen. In some cases, the facility may man-
ufacture the two products a quarter mile away from each other. The products
may not even cross paths until they reach the distribution center, in packages,
which is really no different from how they meet at the grocery store.
That doesn’t mean you should ignore the precaution. It’s not worth the risk,
so the best recourse is to simply pass on such products and avoid them all. If
you have a serious craving for the food and can’t track down a safer alterna-
tive, then give the manufacturer a call and ask for details. 
Always err on the safe side when it comes to precautionary labels. Risks 
of cross-contamination are certainly less with large companies than with
smaller ones, but you should always check with the manufacturer to be sure.
121
Chapter 6: Concocting Your Own Avoidance Diet

Taking warning labels seriously 
For lifelong label readers like me, the recent flood of precautionary labels has
become an enormous source of frustration. Prior to the late 1990s these pre-
cautions were as rare as a bag of peanuts at a food allergy seminar. Now they’re
cropping up on the labels of the most innocuous foods. And the worst part of it
is that they’re starting to show up on lots of stuff I used to love to eat!
So, what’s a food allergy sufferer to do? You have no choice — once the pre-
caution appears, the product is off limits. As soon as the manufacturer
splashes this warning on a product, the company is perfectly free to stop
cleaning its equipment. A product that was previously safe may now pose a
deadly risk.
Remaining cautious of foods you 
haven’t reacted to . . . yet 
Say you ate a couple candy bars before noticing the new precautionary warn-
ing, and they didn’t make you sick. Can you safely assume that the warning is
bogus and you’re free to continue consuming the product without a care in
the world? 
Nope.
Even if you haven’t reacted to the product, yet, continuing to consume it
places you at risk. Why? Here are two good reasons:
 First, the company may have changed the way it cleans its equipment,
especially now that it has a warning on the label that protects it.
 Second (and more importantly), the nature of contaminated food is
entirely inconsistent. For example, if the plant produces a non-peanut
candy after producing a peanut candy on the same equipment, the first
100 bags of non-peanut product may be loaded with peanut, while the
next 100 have less, and the last 10,000 have none. Eating this candy is
like playing Russian roulette — you may get away with it the first 49
times and then get burned by bag 50.
Feeding Your Nutritional Needs
Avoidance diets are like being caught between a rock and a hard place, espe-
cially with some of the major food allergens like milk, egg, and wheat, that
comprise such a large part of our diets. You may not be able to eat one or
122
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

more of these foods because they make you sick, but if you don’t eat them
you risk becoming malnourished.
To remain healthy, work with your doctor to devise a strategy that meets
your nutritional needs while ensuring that you avoid the foods that trigger
reactions. This is especially true for infants and young children and for cer-
tain specific nutritional requirements, including calcium. Improper nutrition,
especially during the early years of development, can lead to serious health
problems, including weight loss, poor growth, and weak bones. It may even
affect brain development in young children.
The following sections reveal strategies for meeting nutritional needs while
avoiding problem foods for specific stages of development. Because milk and
milk-based formulas are the most serious concerns during the early stages of
development, the examples we provide in the following sections focus pri-
marily on nutritional issues that arise when infants and children must avoid
milk.
Attending to your infant’s needs
From birth up to approximately two years of age, infants require a diet rich in
fat and protein, so a milk-free diet can be particularly risky for infants. Failing
to meet the minimum requirements for fat, protein, calcium, vitamins, and
other nutrients can have serious long-term consequences, even the loss of IQ
points, so finding a suitable replacement is essential. The following list offers
a few options along with important points to keep in mind when searching for
a solution: 
 Breast feeding is best, although in some instances the mother must
avoid foods in her diet that the baby is allergic to. 
 If breast feeding is not an option, use an infant formula that doesn’t con-
tain cow’s milk. Alternatives to cow’s milk formulas, including soy and
extensively hydrolyzed formulas, may be appropriate alternatives to
breast milk.
 Breast feeding or a suitable infant formula may be needed up to 18 to 
24 months of age to ensure adequate intake of fat, protein, calcium, and
vitamins. 
 Soy is often a good substitute, but many infants who are allergic to milk
are allergic to soy.
 Rice milk is not an adequate substitute.
If you have questions or concerns, consult a nutritionist, no matter what the
age of the child.
123
Chapter 6: Concocting Your Own Avoidance Diet

Keeping your toddler on the right track
After age two or three, meeting a child’s nutritional needs gets a little easier,
at least theoretically. As a toddler, the child is more capable of ingesting and
digesting a wider variety of foods. That’s the easy part. The tough part is that
toddlers are more capable of resisting your efforts to keep they away from
the foods that make them sick, and they’re generally pickier about the foods
they choose to eat.
Toddlers still require lots of protein, but their fat needs become easier to
meet. (Most pediatricians normally switch a child without food allergies from
whole milk to a milk with a lower fat content at age two.) The approach for
meeting the vitamin needs of a toddler with food allergies is much the same
as meeting the needs of a toddler without food allergies — the child should
eat a variety and a sufficient amount of fruits and vegetables.
For toddlers with milk allergy, getting enough calcium is especially challeng-
ing. Try the following options until you find something that your child likes or
at least doesn’t fuss about too much:
 Milk substitutes, such as soy milk or rice milk (rice milk is okay for older
kids, because they can get their protein from other sources)
 Calcium-fortified juices, such as orange juice with calcium
 Calcium supplements
How much calcium does a toddler need? About 600 mg of calcium per day.
Fortified juices typically have 200 to 300 mg per cup, but don’t count on the
label to tell you that. Labels typically express the amount of calcium in per-
centages, not milligrams, where 100 percent equals an outdated adult recom-
mended daily dose of 1,000 mg (the current recommendation is 1300 mg for
adults).
Some people think they can eat enough green vegetables to meet calcium
needs but you would literally need to eat a head of broccoli daily to accom-
plish this. 
Getting a sufficient amount of calcium is critical for development and health,
so keep trying different sources of calcium until you hit on something that
your child can live with.
Maintaining a healthy diet with 
children and adolescents 
Follow the average kid around for a day and watch what he eats, and you get
a pretty clear idea of the challenges you can expect when trying to meet the
124
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

nutritional needs of a child or adolescent, even one who doesn’t have a food
allergy.
At this stage, you either have an ally who’s ready to take on more responsibil-
ity for taking care of herself and meeting her own nutritional needs or a child
who prefers a more liberal lifestyle with lousy eating habits and a penchant
for increased risk taking — cheating on the diet. Guess which one is more
common. In Chapter 14, “Empowering Your Adolescent or Teenager,” I dis-
cuss the challenges in greater detail and provide tips on how to effectively
overcome them . . . with the assistance of your child, of course.
Focusing on calcium intake for adults
As an adult, you’re capable of attending to your own nutritional needs, so I
won’t lecture you on the benefits of a varied diet, including plenty of fruits
and vegetables that you’re not allergic to. I will, however, stress the impor-
tance of getting your RDA of calcium. 
By weight, calcium is one of the most plentiful minerals in the human body,
accounting for 1.5 percent to 2 percent of body weight. And, as the milk com-
mercials claim, it builds strong teeth and bones. The average adult requires
about 1,300 milligrams of calcium, and people who don’t have a milk allergy
have little problem meeting this goal through a variety of milk products,
including milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream. When you’re on a milk-free
diet, however, you need to explore other sources:
 Milk substitutes, such as soy milk or rice milk
 Calcium-fortified juices, such as orange juice with calcium
 Calcium supplements.
 Green leafy vegetables, including broccoli, collards, kale, mustard
greens, turnip greens, and bok choy or Chinese cabbage
 Canned salmon or sardines, shellfish, almonds, Brazil nuts, and dried
beans, assuming you’re not allergic to those foods
Taking Turns with a Rotation Diet 
Unlike an avoidance diet, which calls for the elimination of offending foods
from your diet, a rotation diet allows you to eat some of the food some of the
time. In other words, you limit the amount of the food that causes problems,
but you don’t completely eliminate it. For example, you may consume a toler-
able amount of milk products, once or twice a week.
125
Chapter 6: Concocting Your Own Avoidance Diet

Sounds good, huh? 
Well, it is good for some people — mostly for people with food intolerances
rather than true food allergies. Food intolerances tend to be much more
dose-related than food allergies, which can often be triggered by exposure to
a very small amount of the problem food. Only by consulting with your
doctor can you decide whether a rotation diet may be right for you.
Consult your doctor and get permission before attempting any sort of rota-
tion diet, and check in regularly with your doctor. Your doctor may need to
adjust your diet over time, as the food allergies may fluctuate in either 
direction.
Knowing when a rotation 
diet can benefit you
If you have a severe food allergy, I have one word of advice about trying a
rotation diet: forget-about-it. Nobody with a serious food allergy or a risk of
anaphylaxis should attempt it. It’s just too risky. Consider it only if you meet
all four of the following conditions:
 Your food allergy is mild.
 Your doctor tells you that you’re at absolutely no risk of experiencing
anaphylaxis.
 Your doctor gives you permission.
 Your doctor creates and monitors your diet, and you check in regularly
for any necessary modifications.
Charting your game plan
An effective rotation diet is like a good golf swing. It requires a careful back-
swing, a smooth forward stroke, and an effective follow-through:
 Backswing: Plan in advance so you know exactly how much of each food
you can eat on which days. Keep a calendar or food diary.
 Forward stroke: Follow your calendar, and don’t try to fudge on the
amounts of food you eat or the days on which you eat them.
 Follow-through: Log the foods you eat and note how you feel after
eating them (on your calendar or food diary), and check with your
doctor regularly to make necessary adjustments. In some cases, your
doctor may need to do follow-up allergy tests to ensure that increased
exposure to certain foods is not worsening your allergies.

A
t the core of every food allergy treatment plan are evasive maneuvers to
steer you clear of the foods that commonly trigger reactions. In a world
with so many foods and where certain ingredients pop up in the most unsus-
pecting places, avoidance can be nearly impossible 100 percent of the time.
Even my most careful and vigilant patients occasionally experience reactions,
sometimes severe.
For immediate relief and when avoidance is not 100 percent effective, the
best available option is to treat the symptoms. In this Chapter, I cover the
most common symptoms triggered by food allergies and help you stock your
arsenal of medications to fight back when all attempts to avoid the foods that
ail you aren’t enough.
Pro-Acting and Reacting to Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is a sudden, severe, and potentially life-threatening allergic reac-
tion. You can minimize the severity of anaphylactic reactions by reacting to
them in the following ways: 
 Recognize the symptoms early.
 Self-treat immediately with the proper medications.
 Seek emergency medical care promptly. 

Effectively preventing future anaphylactic reactions hinges on avoiding the
triggers. Whenever you experience a severe reaction, try to identify the spe-
cific trigger.
The following sections present preventive measures and emergency treat-
ment instructions to avoid severe reactions and cut them short when preven-
tive measures fail. See Chapter 2 for a more complete discussion of
anaphylaxis — its symptoms and risk factors.
Defending yourself against 
anaphylactic episodes
Anaphylaxis is a frightening experience for the person who suffers the reac-
tion, as well as for anyone in the near vicinity. Dreading future reactions is
normal, but you can take a few simple measures to reduce the risk and calm
your fears, as I explain in the following sections. 
Obtaining an allergy workup
If you’ve experienced an anaphylactic reaction, visit an allergist for a workup.
Your allergist can perform skin or blood tests to help identify your specific
allergies, offer guidance on the treatment of future reactions, and provide you
with a treatment plan in writing. (See Chapter 5 for details.) 
Avoiding triggers
Avoidance is key to preventing future severe reactions. If you’ve experienced
an anaphylactic reaction in the past, try to identify the food or foods that
triggered the reaction, and strictly avoid those foods. See Chapter 6 for
details about avoidance diets and for food allergy sheets that can assist you
in identifying allergens in processed foods. The Chapters in Part III provide
avoidance maneuvers that you can take at home and away from home.
Wearing an allergy alert bracelet or necklace
If you have a severe or even potentially severe food allergies or have experi-
enced an anaphylactic reaction, wear an allergy alert bracelet, necklace, or
similar alert tag at all times. If you experience another reaction and are too ill
to explain your condition, your tag can help responders provide proper treat-
ment as quickly as possible. This measure is especially important in children.
The alert tag should include a list of known allergies, as well as the name and
phone number of an emergency contact. One device, Medic Alert, provides a
toll-free number that emergency medical workers can call to obtain your
medical history, list of medications, family emergency contact numbers, and
healthcare provider names and numbers.
128
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

Drawing up an anaphylactic treatment
plan well in advance 
Once you’ve experienced an allergic reaction, particularly a severe reaction,
the last thing you want to think about is a future reaction that may be even
worse, but that’s exactly what you need to do to save your life.
In the following sections, I cover the essential components of an effective
emergency plan. Team up with your doctor to iron out the details and formu-
late your own plan using the form shown in Figure 7-1. This form can function
as a great tool to include in your home emergency station, described in
Chapter 10 and to keep on file with the school nurse.
Because anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, you must treat it as you would
treat any absolute medical emergency, including heart attack, stroke, or a
severe diabetic reaction.
An effective plan can save your life, minimize the severity of an anaphylactic
reaction, and get you feeling a whole lot better a whole lot sooner.
Stocking up on epinephrine . . . and knowing how to use it
Patients with a history of anaphylaxis or who are at risk of future anaphylac-
tic reactions should always carry two epinephrine autoinjectors (EpiPen or
Twinject). Epinephrine is the most effective drug. It treats all the symptoms
of anaphylaxis, including the most threatening symptoms — low blood pres-
sure, chest tightness or wheezing, and throat closure.
Your doctor can provide you with a prescription for epinephrine autoinjec-
tors, but you also need to know some critical facts about autoinjectors to
maximize their potential benefit:
❏Fill your epinephrine autoinjector prescription immediately. 
❏Read the instructions provided with your autoinjector and review them
with each refill just in case the instructions have changed.
❏Make sure you’re getting the right dose. Autoinjectors come in 2 doses —
a junior for young children and a regular strength for everyone else.
Officially, the full strength devices are approved for use for anyone over
66 pounds. The junior strength is a perfect dose for someone who weighs
33 pounds, but for every pound above that it underdoses more and more.
For this reason most experts, including me, recommend switching from
junior to regular strength somewhere between 45 and 55 pounds.
❏Store epinephrine at normal room temperature away from cold and heat
sources. 
129
Chapter 7: Making It Stop: Finding Symptomatic Relief

❏Examine the epinephrine cartridge window periodically to ensure that
the solution is colorless and contains no floating particles. Replace solu-
tions that are discolored or contain particles.
❏Check the expiration date on your autoinjectors regularly. (An expired
autoinjector is better than no injector, so if all you can find during an
emergency is an expired one, use it.)
❏Keep at least two epinephrine autoinjectors with you at all times. Having
an additional autoinjector at work, school, and home is a great idea. 
❏Store the home injector in a convenient location, and let family members
and friends know where it is. Sticking it in the “junk drawer” or a clut-
tered medicine cabinet is a bad idea.
❏Get up to speed on how to use your injector, as explained later in this
chapter.
❏Train family members, close friends, teachers, and co-workers on proper
use in preparation for a possible emergency. In the midst of a reaction,
you may panic and be unable to assist with your own injection.
❏Act quickly when you first notice symptoms. A quick response is essen-
tial in preventing serious complications. Few, if any, known fatal reactions
have been due to food-induced anaphylaxis when epinephrine was given
promptly. 
❏A second dose may be needed if symptoms are worsening or not improv-
ing within 10–15 minutes or if symptoms return before emergency per-
sonnel and equipment are available.
Both the EpiPen and the Twinject offer trainer devices for practice and to
demonstrate proper use to others. Anyone who may need to use it must prac-
tice with the trainer first. Most people end up with lots of expired injectors
and I find it helpful to shoot an orange or grapefruit with one of these to see
what a real one feels like. This is also a great practice tool for adolescents
who are getting ready to take over responsibility for their medicines. 
If you have a history of severe reactions, grab you autoinjector and give your-
self a shot as soon as you notice the telltale signs of a reaction. As a general
rule, administer epinephrine immediately if you:
 Have any two systems involved in a reaction, such as hives and stomach
pains, or any other combination of two or more symptoms that affect
different parts of your body
 Are having trouble breathing
 Feel tightness in your throat
 Feel faint . . . as though you may pass out

Some people refuse to use epinephrine for fear of the needle. Others, in-
cluding some doctors, won’t prescribe it because they fear the side effects.
Epinephrine is a very safe medicine. For a huge majority of allergy sufferers,
the benefit far outweighs the risks. Discuss any concerns you have immedi-
ately with your doctor, and if your doctor is reluctant to prescribe epineph-
rine, you may need to do a little convincing or switch doctors.
Reviewing additional treatments for anaphylaxis
Although epinephrine is the first and best response to the onset of an ana-
phylactic reaction, other treatments are often used in addition to epinephrine
to provide added relief:
 Antihistamines: Diphendydramine (Benedryl) and other antihistamines,
given by mouth or by injection, can help symptoms subside during 
anaphylaxis.
 H2 blockers: Another class of antihistamines, called H2 blockers, may
also be effective when added to the usual antihistamines — the H1
blockers. H2 blockers include medications like ranitidine (Zantac) and

Tragic delay
James, a 19-year-old patient of mine with
peanut allergy and asthma, ate a chocolate chip
cookie at his girlfriend’s home that was sup-
posed to be safe. He immediately felt itching in
his mouth and throat and told his girlfriend that
he must be having a reaction. He had never had
a severe reaction before and was sure that a
dose of antihistamine would work. They found
some Benadryl in the medicine cabinet, and
James took some, but a few minutes later he felt
an asthma attack coming on, so he took several
puffs of his inhaler. He looked scared, and his
girlfriend knew something terribly bad was hap-
pening. She asked whether she should call 911
but James told her that they should wait a few
minutes. 
Where was his epinephrine? Unfortunately,
since he had never had a severe reaction,
James and his girlfriend had stopped filling the
prescriptions I had been giving them each year.
All my advice about this deadly combination of
asthma and peanut allergy had gone unheard.
Over the next 10 minutes, James began to swell,
had increasing trouble breathing, turned blue,
and passed out. By the time the paramedics
arrived, his heart had stopped and no amount of
epinephrine could save him at that point.
I met with his parents at the emergency room
that evening and then again a few days later.
They wanted to know whether this could have
been prevented. Of course it could have been
prevented if James had not trusted that the
cookie was safe. That point is very important,
but it’s not the take home message. The real
message here is that severe reactions can
happen, even if you follow the strictest avoid-
ance measures, so you must be prepared at all
times. If James had had his epinephrine with
him and had taken it promptly, he would still be
with us and may well be married to the young
woman who instead had to watch him die
before her eyes.

cimetidine (Tagamet), which are commonly used to treat ulcers and acid
indigestion.
 Inhalant medications: Albuterol and other asthma medications can help
if you have difficulty breathing, chest tightness, or coughing.
 Corticosteroids: Prednisone and other corticosteroids can help prevent
a recurrence in the hours following an anaphylactic reaction and prevent
late reactions, but they don’t work rapidly enough for emergency 
treatment. 
Other treatment in the emergency room should address any life-threatening
respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. ER personnel may need to give
you additional doses of epinephrine and possibly oxygen or a breathing tube
(to keep your airway open) for severe breathing problems. Treatment may
also include medications to treat low blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmias
(irregular heart beat). Even if symptoms are completely under control, your
doctor should keep you under observation for a minimum of four hours due
to the possibility of biphasic reactions.
Dealing with Itchy Stuff: Eczema
Eczema is a condition that may or may not involve food allergy. As I discuss
in Chapter 2, food allergy is responsible for about 40 percent of the cases,
and even when food allergy is the prime suspect, it is almost never the sole
suspect. I always tell my patients that some part of eczema is literally the
skin you were born to have. Even in the perfect environment and on the per-
fect diet, some people’s skin is just too dry, too itchy, or too sensitive. 
When food allergy is involved in eczema, the five most common food aller-
gens are the most likely culprits: egg, milk, peanut, soy, and wheat. Other
foods can certainly be involved but these top five are the most important to
remember.
When food-allergy-induced eczema is itching to drive you crazy, avoiding the
foods that trigger reactions is the first and most effective course of action,
but symptoms can linger long after you stop consuming the food. If dryness
and itchiness persist, treat the symptoms:
 Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize. Use a cream rather than a lotion,
and apply it at least once a day, particularly immediately following a
bath or shower. Most people with eczema discover that taking a long
bath in warm or tepid water provides much needed relief, but if you
don’t follow up with moisturizer, that comforting bath can lead to drier
133
Chapter 7: Making It Stop: Finding Symptomatic Relief

and itchier skin later. If your eczema is severe, apply moisturizing cream
multiple times per day. 
 Apply medicated creams. Medicated creams or ointments — usually
steroid preparations such as hydrocortisone — can control skin inflam-
mation. While some steroid creams are very potent and may be unsafe
to use on a regular basis, especially in children, low-potency creams are
very safe and can be used on regular basis, if needed. Two nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory creams/ointments for treating eczema are presently
on the market. Their safety, however, has recently come under scrutiny,
and the FDA requires a black box warning on these products until fur-
ther research ensures their safety. 
 Soothe the itch with oral antihistamines. Oral antihistamines can be
valuable in relieving eczema’s severe itching. The older style antihista-
mines, including Benedryl, are particularly beneficial at bedtime, since
their sedative side effect can help you sleep through the itch. For day-
time itching, opt for a non-sedating antihistamine, such as Zyrtec,
Clarinex, or Allegra. 
Identify and avoid anything that further irritates your skin, including any
clothing, soap, detergents, or lotions that exacerbate your eczema.
Dealing with More Itchy Stuff: Hives
People who have hives know all too well what they are. If you itch inside and
out, are covered with red splotches, and haven’t been camping in a cloud of
mosquitoes, you probably have hives. What caused them? I discuss that
topic and describe the telltale signs of a hives outbreak in Chapter 2, but if
you have hives you probably don’t care where they came from. All you want
to know is how to shake them.
The good thing about hives is that they typically go away much faster than a
mosquito bite. They can be severe, but in most cases, a single dose of anti-
histamine leads to quick, long-lasting relief. If someone comes to me com-
plaining of a week or two struggle with hives, I rarely suspect that food
allergy is playing a major role.
To send your hives packing, I recommend the following medications, depend-
ing on the severity of the outbreak and the likelihood that the outbreak sig-
nals the beginning of a more severe reaction:
 Old-style, fast-acting antihistamines like diphendydramine (Benedryl)
are tried and true treatment for hives, although other antihistamines
might be equally effective. 
134
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

 Liquid forms of antihistamines are great for treating food reactions,
because your body tends to absorb them more quickly, but chewable or
fast-melt tablets may be equally effective. 
 Epinephrine is the drug of choice if you believe that your hives are a
sign of a potentially dangerous reaction. Consult your doctor.
Other conditions, including anxiety, can cause hives, so if your hives appear
to be unrelated to the foods you eat, consult your doctor about other possi-
ble causes and their treatment. Chapter 2 discusses the most common other
causes.
Alleviating Gut-Retching Food Allergies
Your gastrointestinal (GI) tract is like a pipeline, starting at your mouth and
ending at your... well... you know. Gastrointestinal food reactions can occur
anywhere along this pipeline, and symptoms vary depending on where the
reaction hits. As I explain in Chapter 2, reactions can be acute (occurring
soon after exposure) or chronic, sometimes low-level reactions. 
The GI tract is frequently involved in anaphylactic reactions. While a single
episode of vomiting may not be cause for extreme concern, other GI symp-
toms, such as repeated vomiting or abdominal pain, are often a sign of a more
severe reaction, so keep your epinephrine handy.
In the following sections, I introduce the most common GI tract conditions
often attributed to food allergy, starting with the mouth and traveling down
the pipeline.
Treating oral allergy syndrome
By definition, oral allergy syndrome is a reaction restricted to the lips and
mouth and is characterized by itching (sometimes severe) and swelling (usu-
ally mild). Because the reaction is localized to the lips and mouth, it’s not
dangerous in and of itself, but sometimes, oral allergy syndrome can foretell
the onset of a more severe reaction, in which the term “oral allergy syn-
drome” no longer applies.
Another name for the oral allergy syndrome is the pollen related allergy 
syndrome. This name refers to the fact that the allergies that cause the 
syndrome — usually triggered by fresh fruits and vegetables — occur
because of cross-reactivity with certain pollens. People with allergy to tree
pollens, for example, may experience oral symptoms after eating apples,
cherries, or peaches, while those with ragweed allergy may react to melons
or carrots.
135
Chapter 7: Making It Stop: Finding Symptomatic Relief

The allergies commonly associated with oral allergy syndrome are unique in
the following ways:
 These allergies begin to show up in later childhood, only after the pollen
allergies are strong enough to trigger cross-reactivity to the related foods.
 As opposed to most food allergens (peanut allergen becomes stronger
with roasting), the allergens in these foods are largely destroyed by
cooking. So someone with a reaction to fresh apples can usually eat
apple pie or drink apple juice without experiencing a reaction. (Apple
cider is another story.)
 Symptoms may vary with the season. Some people know that their apple
allergy will become more intense in the spring (tree pollen season) and
then begin to wane by the summer or fall.
 Allergy shots for the pollens associated with the allergenic food may
make the related food allergy go away.
 The skin of some fruits contains more allergen than the meat of the fruit.
Preventions and treatments for oral allergy syndrome vary, depending on the
approach you decide to take:
 Do nothing. Most people don’t even tell their doctors about the allergy
and decide to live with it. If you enjoy the fruit or vegetable more than
you dread having an itchy mouth and lips, then you may decide to par-
take of it. 
 Avoidance. If having an itchy mouth and lips isn’t worth the enjoyment,
then you may choose to forego the food.
 Strict avoidance. If eating these fruits or vegetables causes more severe
reactions beyond those considered to be oral allergy syndrome, stricter
avoidance is obviously needed. 
 Medicate. Most reactions, however, resolve on their own within 20 or 30
minutes with no treatment. 
Easing the effects of eosinophilic 
gastroenteritis
An eosinophil is a type of blood cell commonly found at the crime scene —
the site of any allergic reaction. These cells are responsible for much of the
inflammation that occurs in most chronic allergic conditions, including those
that affect the skin (eczema), the nose (allergic rhinitis), the lungs (asthma),
and the GI tract.
136
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

When eosinophils set course for your GI tract, they can cause a condition
called allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis — a chronic inflammation in the GI
tract, sometimes localized and sometimes involving the entire GI tract. When
the upper GI tract is involved, such as with eosinophilic esophagitis (swelling
in the esophagus), symptoms include pain, reflux, poor appetite, and diffi-
culty swallowing. Swelling of the lower GI often results in pain, diarrhea, or
weight loss. Food allergy causes most cases of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. 
In many cases, eosinophilic gastroenteritis is not an IgE-mediated allergy,
meaning that the usual blood and skin tests may turn up negative for food
allergy. Even so, your doctor may recommend a standard food allergy 
treatment:
 Avoidance diet: Many of those who suffer from eosinophilic gastroen-
teritis have multiple food allergies, so a complicated avoidance diet may
be needed. See Chapter 6 for details on avoidance diets.
 Change in formula (for infants): In babies, sometimes a simple change
of formulas may be sufficient for stemming future reactions.
When food avoidance is ineffective, steroids are the only medicines that
clearly work. You may respond to a type of asthma medication called mon-
telukast (Singulair) or other newer medications. Antihistamines are of little
use. Other immunosuppressive agents may offer some relief, but they all
carry risks and need to be monitored carefully, usually with the combined
efforts of your allergist and gastroenterologist.
Muting the symptoms of eosinophilic
esophagitis (EE)
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a form of eosinophilic gastroenteritis that’s
localized to the esophagus — your food chute. This condition is usually trig-
gered by a food allergy, although environmental allergies can also contribute.
In some cases, food allergy doesn’t even play a role.
When food allergy is the cause, avoidance is the key to feeling better. When
the cause is something more than food allergy, I’ve had excellent success
using steroid-based asthma inhalers. Instead of having patients inhale the
medicine, however, I instruct my patients to spray it in the mouth and swal-
low it.
137
Chapter 7: Making It Stop: Finding Symptomatic Relief

Checking out remedies 
for allergic proctitis
Allergic proctitis (or allergic colitis) is a pain in the . . . well . . . end of the
intestinal tract. The condition is especially common in young babies with
symptoms of blood and mucous in the stools. Milk or soy allergy is typically
the cause, although other foods may be involved in breast-fed babies. 
Because allergic proctitis is not IgE mediated, it generally responds well to
one of the following treatment trials:
 Formula fed: If the baby takes formula, then a milk-free or soy-free trial
may clear up the condition.
 Breast fed: If the baby is breast feeding, the mother may need to avoid
soy, milk, and possibly other suspect foods on a trial basis to identify
the problem food.
Allergic proctitis is a rather benign condition in which the babies tend to feel
and grow well. Half the babies who have it are fine by the time they reach
their first year, and most others can eat all foods by the age of two or three.
Caring for enterocolitis syndrome
In young babies, a food allergy can cause a condition called enterocolitis syn-
drome, characterized by severe, repetitive vomiting that may lead to dehy-
dration. Skin and blood tests are of no help in identifying food allergy,
because the allergy is not IgE-mediated, but cause and effect usually provide
a clear link to the food that’s triggering the reaction. 
Milk and soy allergies are most common but these reactions also occur with a
large number of other foods. Food avoidance is the only treatment, and most
children outgrow the allergy by two to three years of age. During these latter
years, your doctor may recommend re-introducing the problem foods, but
you should proceed with extreme caution, because reactions can be severe.
Alleviating the symptoms of celiac disease
Celiac disease, also known as gluten sensitive enteropathy, is a form of food
sensitivity in which people can’t tolerate any form of gluten — a protein
found in wheat, rye, and barley. Symptoms typically include abdominal pain,
vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss (or poor growth in young children). 
138
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

Symptoms can be quite severe and appear very early in life or remain low-
grade, flying well below your doctor’s radar until adulthood. Although celiac
disease is not IgE-mediated, your doctor can perform other blood tests to make
an accurate diagnosis. In all cases strict avoidance of all gluten is essential and
typically requires you to abstain from these foods for the rest of your life.
For details on how to create and manage your own tasty and varied gluten-
free diet, check out Living Gluten-Free For Dummies, by Danna Korn.
Catching Your Breath . . . Asthma
Symptoms and Treatments
Short of breath? Coughing? Wheezing? If you are, you may have asthma, a
chronic condition, and underlying allergies may be triggering the symptoms,
but a food allergy isn’t the most likely cause. When you have an allergy-induced
form of asthma, environmental allergens are the most likely suspects.
When you consult your family physician and describe your symptoms, she’s
likely to offer a diagnosis based solely on your reported symptoms, or she
may subject you to a series of breathing tests, assuming you’re at least five or
six years old. Your allergist may perform a series of allergy tests, but these
typically don’t include tests for food allergy, unless you report additional
symptoms typical of food allergy.
Although food allergy typically plays only a minor role, if any, in asthma, if you
have asthma and a food allergy, you’re at risk for experiencing more severe
allergic reactions when you ingest a food that triggers a reaction, especially a
reaction in which the throat and lungs are involved. Antihistamines have no
effect on these reactions. In such cases, the reaction qualifies as an emer-
gency. (See “Pro-Acting and Reacting to Anaphylaxis.”)
For details on the diagnosis and treatment of asthma and tips for living well
with asthma, check out Asthma For Dummies, by William E. MD, MBA Berger
and Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
Treating a Chronic “Cold”: 
Allergic Rhinitis
Most people attribute runny nose and sneezing to the common cold or hay
fever. Something in your nose — a virus or irritant — must be causing the
problem, right? Well, that’s usually true, but food allergies can also trigger
139
Chapter 7: Making It Stop: Finding Symptomatic Relief

symptoms in your snout, including a runny nose, sneezing, congestion, and
itchy, watery eyes. 
If an allergen is the cause, your sniffles and sneezes are probably due to a
condition called allergic rhinitis. Rhinitis means nose — think rhinoceros.
Whether your allergic rhinitis is triggered by environmental allergens or by a
particular food, the symptom relievers are pretty much the same:
 Antihistamines, including loratadine (Claritin) and diphendydramine
(Benedryl).
 Nasal sprays that often contain the same steroid medications used for
asthma. 
 Leukotriene blockers, such as Singulair, can also be helpful in controlling
nasal allergies.
 A combination of nasal sprays and antihistamines (for the most stub-
born cases).

Debunking Alternative 
Tests and Therapies
In This Chapter
 Getting the straight dope on alternative allergy tests
 Steering clear of time- and money-wasting homeopathy
 Avoiding the overblown claims of vitamin and herb peddlers
 Poking holes in the leaky gut theory
 Dismissing meditation and massage as cure-alls
S
pend about a half hour on the Internet, and you can find hundreds of
Web sites where quackologists spew forth untested theories about aller-
gies, alternative allergy testing, and cures. Many of the worst sites claim that
just about every health condition imaginable from cancer to psychiatric and
behavioral disorders can be traced back to something you’re eating or not
eating. These sites may even attempt to convince you that the medical com-
munity is somehow conspiring to keep you ill.
I would love to tell you and the thousands of allergy patients I see that a mira-
cle cure for food allergy is available, and I wouldn’t care who discovered it. If
I could cure my own peanut allergy by popping fistful of vitamins, sitting for
an hour a day in the lotus position, or drinking some magic herbal potion, I’d
do it myself. The facts, however, prove that such therapies offer very little
promise and even less scientific evidence of success. Some may even be 
dangerous.
I can save you a lot of time, money, frustration, and unnecessary risk through
a few simple words of advice: Get to a food allergist, get tested, and stick with
the best care currently available — proven medical tests and treatments.
Follow that advice, and you don’t even have to read this chapter.

I write this chapter only because I know that you’re likely to research food
allergies on the Internet. Research is great, and I encourage you to investigate
the latest medical breakthroughs, but I know that your research is going to
lead you down some dark alleys. To keep you from getting swindled by the
people and ideas lurking in those dark alleys, in this chapter, I separate med-
ical fact from quack, so you can spend your time, energy, and money pursu-
ing tests and treatments that actually work.
Exposing Meaningless Tests 
and Other Mumbo Jumbo
One of the biggest crocks of quackery is the claim that allergy tests are simply
not thorough enough to accurately detect food allergies and sensitivities. Most
of the practitioners who denounce standard allergy tests promote their own
supposedly superior tests to uncover hidden allergies and sensitivities that 
can cause everything from acne and fatigue to obesity and even cancer.
These dubious tests are risky at best and dangerous at their worst for several
reasons:
 These tests and treatments have not been validated by sound medical
research data and are not supported by the medical community.
 They’re often expensive, and your insurance won’t cover them.
 They’re unreliable.
 Test results typically call for convoluted and costly treatment regimens
that don’t work.
 Testing and treatments may discourage you from seeking effective med-
ical treatment, leading to the potential danger of a severe reaction.
In the following sections, I expose the most common and questionable alter-
native tests for allergies.
Polling your cellular reactions: 
Cytotoxic testing
Back in the early 1980s, alternative practitioners, nutrition consultants, and
chiropractors got all excited about cytotoxic testing — also called Bryan’s test,
the Metabolic Intolerance Test, or “sensitivity testing.” “Cyto” means “cell” 
142
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

and you know what “toxic” means, so the idea behind this type of testing is to
discover substances that poison your white blood cells — the blood cells that
primarily fight infection.
To perform the tests and recommend treatment, the practitioner does the 
following:
1. Draws a sample of your blood and then separates out the white blood
cells. 
2. Applies samples of the white blood cells to a large number of micro-
scope slides, each of which is coated with a dried food extract, such as
those used for skin testing. 
3. Examines the slides under a microscope at various intervals to see
whether the white blood cells changed shape or disintegrated — 
supposedly signs of allergy or sensitivity to the particular food.
4. Diagnoses your symptoms and recommends a personalized diet pro-
gram that includes vitamins and minerals, most of which are con-
veniently for sale at the clinic.
143
Chapter 8: Debunking Alternative Tests and Therapies
Cytotoxic hype
One of the most blatantly over-hyped promo-
tions for cytotoxic testing was put forth by a lab-
oratory in California that charged $350 to test for
186 common foods and additives. One of its ads,
posted with the headlined “DISASTER LINKED
TO THE FOOD YOU EAT!,” claimed that “if you
currently suffer from any health difficulties, this
test is worth taking.” 
A brochure from the company suggested that
cytotoxic testing could help solve the problems
of obesity, headaches, stomach and intestinal
problems, depression, stress, confusion, sinus
problems, asthma, arthritis, and hypoglycemia.
They put on quite a road show to appeal to
patients who were ready to listen to anyone
who held out the promise of a cure for any and
all their unexplained maladies. 
After the company’s glitzy slide show presenta-
tion, a young man who claimed that he had
undergone two years of special nutrition train-
ing gave a lecture. Among other things, he
advised the assembled group that inhalant sen-
sitivities are not important, so people allergic to
cats would no longer have cat allergy if they
simply stopped eating the foods that made them
allergic to cats. 
A well know allergist and his wife happened to
be in attendance. The doctor and his wife actu-
ally had no allergies, but her test report, which
arrived three weeks later, said that she was
allergic to 25 foods, including wheat, cane
sugar, corn, potato, beef, and milk, and she
should abstain from eating all of them.
Not only were the test results blatantly wrong,
but the recommendation to avoid all these foods
would have led to a significant reduction in
quality of life and perhaps even to malnutrition. 

Advocates of cytotoxic testing claim that food sensitivities can cause acne,
anxiety, arthritis, asthma, back pain, baldness, bedwetting, conjunctivitis,
constipation, depression, diarrhea, eczema, excessive sweating, fatigue,
headaches, hearing loss, hoarseness, hypertension, hyperactivity, insomnia,
learning disorders, nosebleeds, obesity, rashes, sinus trouble, stomach disor-
ders, susceptibility to cancer, and just about any other physical ailment you
(or they) can imagine.
The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI), the
nation’s largest group of allergists, has concluded that cytotoxic testing is
ineffective for diagnosing food or inhalant allergies. Its position paper noted
the following:
 One study found that white blood cells from allergic patients reacted 
no differently when exposed to substances known to produce symptoms
than when exposed to substances to which the patients were not 
sensitive. 
 Another study found that cytotoxic test results did not correlate with
allergic reactions or other negative reactions to foods and that the
results were inconsistent when repeated in the same patient. 
 In a double-blind controlled study, positive cytotoxic tests were fre-
quently obtained to foods that produced no clinical symptoms, and
foods that tested negative in cytotoxic tests did produce symptoms. 
 Another double-blind study found the test results varied from day to day. 
Looking at your lymphocytes 
with ELISA/ACT testing
The ELISA/ACT test is another medically unproven test that its advocates
claim can uncover hidden allergies. According to a brochure promoting this
test, scientific estimates show that hidden allergies are responsible for as
much as 60 percent of all human illness. The brochure states that any of the
following conditions may indicate the presence of hidden allergies: chronic
headaches, migraines, difficulty sleeping, dizziness, runny or stuffy nose,
postnasal drip, ringing in the ears, earaches, blurred vision, irregular or rapid
heartbeat, asthma, nausea and vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, irritable
bowel syndrome, hives, skin rashes (psoriasis, eczema), muscle aches, joint
pain, arthritis, nervous tension, fatigue, depression, mental dullness, and dif-
ficulty in getting your work done.
To perform ELISA/ACT testing, a clinician draws your blood; cultures the
white blood cells (lymphocytes); and observes how they react to up to 300
foods, minerals, preservatives, and environmental substances. Upon receiv-
ing the test results, the practitioner (typically a chiropractor) recommends
dietary modification and supplements. Sound familiar?
144
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

Valid scientific studies have shown the ELISA/ACT test to have no value in the
diagnosis of allergy. Moreover, many of the symptoms listed in SPL’s brochure
are unrelated to allergy and require proper medical care rather than supple-
ments for effective treatment. (SPL is short for Serammune Physicians Lab,
the people who developed ELISA/ACT.)
Unclogging your energy fields with NAET
Nambudripad’s Allergy Elimination Technique (NAET) is one of the more
interesting and useless tests and treatments for food allergies and sensitivi-
ties. The idea behind NAET testing is that some foods can block your energy
fields, thus weakening your body — sort of like the effect that kryptonite has
on Superman. NAET essentially combines kinesiology (described in the next
section) with acupuncture (discussed later in this chapter in the section
“Solving Allergies Through Acupuncture or Acupressure”).
To test for food sensitivities, the practitioner instructs you to hold a food or
other suspect substance in your hand or brings the food or substance in close
proximity to your body — supposedly in the path of your energy flow. You
hold your arms akimbo, and the examiner pulls down on your arms. If your
arms show little resistance, then the tested food or substance is deemed to be
a problem. (Some practitioners use other ways to test the effects of foods and
other substances on muscle strength, but you get the idea.)
Positive test results reportedly diagnose a weaknesses in your energy field that
can then be remedied through acupuncture or acupressure. Unfortunately, as
your arms get more and more tired during the procedure, the tests often return
more and more positive results. A positive result may indicate only that you
need to spend a little more time in the gym.
Because NAET is such a kooky idea, any scientist worth her science degree
won’t even test it, so little reliable data is available to support or refute
NAET’s claims.
You can read more about NAET at www.naet.com, but after you read the hype,
I encourage you to visit www.chirobase.org/06DD/naet.html to learn
some interesting facts about NAET and its developer, Devi S. Nambudripad. 
Discrediting the claims 
of other dubious tests
Cytotoxic testing, ELISA/ACT, and NAET are a small sampling of the tests and
procedures that are routinely marketed as food allergy tests and treatments.
Although not all these treatment approaches have undergone rigorous study,
145
Chapter 8: Debunking Alternative Tests and Therapies

none has been shown to be of any diagnostic value. Following are some of the
more common and dubious tests and treatments:
 Pulse testing recommends that you take your pulse soon after eating to
determine if you’re sensitive to the food you just ate. If your pulse rate
increases, then you supposedly are sensitive to a particular food.
Although your pulse rate may increase after eating something, an
increased pulse rate can be due to other causes and certainly does not
provide a reliable indication of food allergy or intolerance.
 ALCAT testing is very similar to cytotoxic and ELISA/ACT testing. It tests
the changes in white blood cell count and shape when the blood is
exposed to certain known allergens and other problem substances. 
 NuTron testing supposedly measures the reactivity of white blood cells
to food and other substances. Practitioners use the results of the test to
design a diet that eliminates foods that cause white cell activation, what-
ever that is. Proponents claim that the diet can help overweight people
lose weight and cure many other conditions “caused by the release of
inflammatory chemicals from the activated white cells.” 
 The LEAP Program uses the Mediator Release Test (MRT) to identify
“delayed food allergies.” Treatment involves dietary changes and some-
times the addition of supplements or herbs. 
 Provocative testing consists of injecting increasing doses of a potential
allergen under your skin until you report symptoms. These tests are no
more accurate and could be more dangerous than standard skin tests,
although, the small doses typically administered during the tests are
usually not all that dangerous.
 Sublingual testing consists of placing suspected foods under your
tongue to see what happens. Again, sublingual testing is no more accu-
rate and is more dangerous than standard skin tests.
 Neutralization progressively administers smaller doses of substances
until you no longer react. This is similar to desensitization protocols,
which I discuss as potentially useful in Chapter 9. Neutralization, how-
ever, is typically performed with ultra-low doses (such as those given
with homeopathic remedies, discussed in the following section), and 
the treatments are typically used to cure conditions such as ADHD or
chronic headaches. Neutralization is not effective in preventing future
food allergy reactions.
 Immune-complex and IgG tests assess immune reactions that are com-
mon but not necessarily related to allergy. These include food-specific IgG
and IgG4 tests, which typically yield multiple positive results (many false
positives) and may indicate a normal immune response to food. They do
not predict true food sensitivity and can lead to recommendations that
result in malnutrition. 
146
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

 Electrodermal skin testing uses a computerized galvanometer to detect
supposed energy imbalances when you come in contact with a food or
substance. Think of it as a hi-tech variation on the theme of applied kine-
siology, described next.
 Applied kinesiology (used in NAET testing as discussed in the section
on NAET) tests your muscle strength after foods and other substances
are placed in the your mouth or hand or held in close proximity to your
body.
 Iridology practitioners claim that they can spot the cause of a wide
range of health conditions simply by peering into your eyes. Although
medical doctors can diagnose several medical conditions, including
Wilson’s disease, by peeking in your peepers, your eyes hold no hidden
clues that you have a particular food allergy.
 Hair analysis studies the mineral content in your hair to supposedly
determine whether you have mineral deficiencies or heavy metal poising
that’s causing your food allergy. Studies prove that no reliable connec-
tion exists between the mineral content of hair or the existence of heavy
metals in your system and the presence or absence of food allergy.
The list of bogus tests I provide here is certainly not all inclusive. New bogus
tests and theories are always popping up, so remain vigilant and skeptical.
When you see a new test or treatment that sounds promising, run it past your
doctor before trusting your health and wallet to unproven theories, tests, and
treatments.
Demystifying Homeopathy: A Little 
Hair of the Dog That Bit You
Homeopathy, founded by Hahnemann in the early 1800s, relies on the princi-
ple that the same substances that cause disease can cure it. Homeopathic
remedies consist of ultra-diluted forms of the substance that’s causing 
symptoms — so diluted in some cases, that the solution in which the sub-
stance is suspended contains only a “memory” of the substance.
Homeopathy is a holistic approach to medicine, with particular emphasis on
the homeopath-patient relationship. The scientific interest in homeopathy for
treating asthma, food allergies, and other chronic illness is considerable, as
attested to by a large number of published studies, but clinical trials show no
clear benefit of such treatments. 
147
Chapter 8: Debunking Alternative Tests and Therapies

A recent review compared more than 100 clinical trials of homeopathy and
conventional medicine in treatment of the same diseases and assessed the
outcomes of the two types of treatment. After a detailed analysis, this review
concluded that according to the results of the clinical trials, conventional
treatments are much more effective than homeopathic remedies for the same
diseases.
Deflating the Hype Surrounding
Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbs 
By eating a well balanced diet and perhaps supplementing it with a good
multi-vitamin once a day, you provide for all your body’s nutritional needs.
Packing your body with mega-doses of vitamins and minerals doesn’t make
you any healthier, although it does help you lose weight as your wallet
becomes lighter.
148

Flushing those allergies out of your system 
Maybe you really don’t have food allergy.
Perhaps your digestive system is just so
gummed up with toxic waste and parasites that
it can’t fully digest your food and effectively
purge undigested foodstuffs, and that’s what’s
causing your reactions. 
That sounds plausible. Certain foods make you
sick. Your gastrointestinal system is responsible
for processing food. So maybe your digestive
system just needs a thorough flushing to make
it fully operational. That’s the theory behind
cleansing regimens that their advocates claim
can cure a wide range of ailments, including
“constipation, IBS, severe gas and bloating,
weight gain, chronic fatigue, irritability, acid
reflux, parasites, stomach pain, diverticulitis,
skin and hair problems, and food allergies.”
Proponents of the theory are convinced that you
can flush these toxins right out of your system
along with your food allergies and a host of other
ailments. The following two body-cleansing
treatments are the most popular:
 Colon cleansing: Practitioners often rec-
ommend a step-by-step cleansing regimen
designed to flush your system with various
herbal laxatives and other purgatives and
then reestablish healthy functioning by
replenishing your body’s supply of friendly
bacteria.
 Chelation: Chelation is a process of leach-
ing the heavy metals — typically calcium,
lead, and mercury — out of your body. A
few practitioners claim that chelation can
cure everything from arthritis to food 
allergies.
No clinical tests prove the effectiveness of
these cleansing regimens in treating food
allergy, and in some cases, they can deplete
your system of essential vitamins, minerals, and
nutrients.

Herbal remedies may be effective in treating some diseases, even food aller-
gies. In Chapter 9, I reveal a Chinese herbal formula that shows great promise. 
The effectiveness of some medicinal herbs in treating some conditions is no
surprise. Many common and effective drugs are derived from plants and
herbs that often contain several active pharmacologic ingredients. Some
medical systems (traditional Chinese medicine, Japanese, Kampo, and
Ayurvedic) largely use herbs, often in fixed mixtures (for example, ma huang
and saiboku-to) to treat diseases, including asthma and rhinitis.
The problems with herbal concoctions are that most of them are no more
effective, no less prone to producing negative side effects, and often less safe
than approved drugs that your doctor recommends:
 Contrary to what many people who choose herbal remedies over phar-
maceuticals often think, herbal remedies can cause serious side effects
and drug interactions. “All natural” does not mean “safe.” Cyanide is a
naturally occurring poison, and it’s certainly not safe.
 Herbal remedies may not be as potent as manufactured medicines, so
they’re often not as effective.
 Herbal formulas don’t have to meet the strict manufacturing standards
of bona-fide medications, so they’re more likely to be tainted by incor-
rect collection of plants, mistakes in preparation or manufacturing, vari-
ations in dosage, and contamination.
Addressing the Leaky-Gut Hypothesis
Another theory that attempts to focus food allergy on the digestive system
rather than on the immune system is the hypothesis that people who have
food or chemical sensitivities actually suffer from an over-permeable stom-
ach lining that allows chemicals and allergens to pass through the stomach
directly into the bloodstream and surrounding tissues. This condition,
referred to as leaky gut syndrome has received a lot of press and generated far
more attention on the Internet and in various articles and books than it
deserves.
Some patients with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, which I discuss in
Chapter 7, may truly get a leaky gut when their disease is out of control. This
is pretty extreme though, and the notion that most of our maladies are due to
leaky gut is primarily a fictitious diagnosis made on the Internet and in other
publications by alternative practitioners. Don’t fall for the hype that leaky gut
syndrome is responsible for causing your food allergy or intolerance.

Healing Yourself through Mind, 
Body, and Soul Manipulations
Attending to your physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual needs is
useful in preserving your overall health and improving your quality of life.
Through proper nutrition and exercise, you preserve your physical well-
being. Meditation and relaxation techniques can reduce stress — a common
trigger for many maladies. Developing productive interpersonal relationships
can further reduce stress and improve your emotional well being. And
addressing your spiritual needs can provide you with a sense of interconnect-
edness and community interactions that can be very rewarding.
As a health professional, I encourage you to establish a healthy lifestyle and
avoid unhealthy habits. Whatever improves your overall health can be a
useful complementary therapy to proven medical treatments. As an allergist,
however, I recommend that you avoid falling into the common trap of think-
ing that any combination of mind, body, and spiritual development can cure
your food allergy. After reading the following facts, you should come to the
same conclusion:
 Chiropractic manipulation of the spine may help you feel better overall,
but any claims that chiropractic care can cure allergies is unproven. Done
wrong, a spinal manipulation can even harm your body.
 Breathing exercises, including those practiced in Kundalini yoga can
make you feel more relaxed and help with fatigue. Practitioners often
recommend breathing exercises to help with asthma and food allergies,
but no clinical test results prove that they’re effective. At best, patients
see some marginal improvement.
 Yoga and other relaxation techniques can have a positive effect on self-
perceived well-being, providing an additional benefit, but they do not
make food allergy go away.
 Hypnosis and biofeedback techniques have been tried to help asthma
sufferers, but have not proven effective.
 Reflexology and other massage techniques attempt to physically
manipulate your body in such a way to relax muscles, improve blood
flow, restore the body’s immune system to optimum functioning, and
even rub out allergies. No clinical test results prove that any type of
massage effectively reduces the incidence or severity of allergic reac-
tions, including food reactions, but hey, if it feels good, don’t let me get
in the way.
150
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

 Other treatments and procedures, including aromatherapy, chromo-
therapy, Bach’s flowers, anthroposophy, Hopi candles, hydro-colon,
urine therapy, and clinical ecology have no reliable data to support
their effectiveness in treating allergy or asthma, although they may help
you forget that you have it for awhile.
Solving Allergies through Acupuncture 
or Acupressure 
Acupuncture is part of traditional Chinese medicine and is widely used for
the treatment of chronic illnesses, including asthma. The theory behind the
use of acupuncture is to restore the balance of “vital flows” by inserting nee-
dles at exact points of the body surface, where the “meridians” of these flows
lie. If your acupuncturist is highly skilled, you don’t even feel the needles
going in . . . or so I’m told.
If you can’t stomach the thought of being poked with needles, variations of
acupuncture are available, including acupressure techniques, such as Shiatsu,
and laser treatments.
We can study acupuncture in a rigorous manner by using sham acupuncture
as a control procedure. Several randomized controlled trials have assessed
the efficacy of acupuncture in asthma, and no convincing evidence proves
that acupuncture of any form is effective in treating asthma, rhinitis, or food
allergy. Stick with proven diagnostic methods described in Chapter 5 and
proven treatments presented in Chapters 6 and 7.

 Curbing the immune system with anti-IgE antibody therapy
 Peering into the promising search for future cures
A
fter many years of research in mice and other animal models of food
allergy, we (food allergy specialists including Bob) are now finally
embarking on human studies investigating ways to truly treat food allergy
and prevent its onset. This is very exciting since all we’ve had to offer until
now is avoidance and symptom relief. I think I can safely say on behalf of
food allergy sufferers the world over, “We want a cure . . . or at least some
more effective treatments for preventing reactions.” 
Discovery of a treatment that can prevent food allergy or shut it down
promises to be a long, slow process, but in the end, I am confident that even-
tually we will be able to treat food allergy such that the risk of anaphylactic
reactions will be dramatically reduced or even eliminated. 
In the long, long run — maybe 15 or 20 years down the road — I’m confident
that we will be talking about curing food allergy, not just reducing reactions or
their severity. Along with being the best doctor I can be to my patients, the
quest for this cure will remain my focus until my eventual retirement.
In this chapter, I guide you on an exploration of medical treatment options
and ongoing research that hold out some future promise for you or a loved
one with food allergy.

Muting Allergen Sensitivities 
through Immunotherapy 
When your immune system freaks out and starts attacking the food you eat,
something is terribly wrong. Somehow, your immune system has been tricked
into making some really bad decisions on what’s good and what’s bad for
you. Your immune system is simply out of whack.
One approach to bringing the immune system back in balance is to retrain it,
through immunotherapy, so it no longer identifies harmless foods as enemy
invaders. In the following sections, I explain the concept of immunotherapy
and describe several immunotherapies currently in development that show
some promise.
Grasping the concept of immunotherapy
Immunotherapy attempts to correct your immune system’s poor judgment 
(in some cases) and strengthen it to fight disease (in other cases). In other
words, immunotherapy is any treatment that works to activate or deactivate
the immune system:
 Activate the immune system: When the immune system lets down its
guard, you become more susceptible to disease. Immunotherapy can
kick your immune system in the pants, so it does a better job protecting
you. For example, cancer treatments (sometimes referred to as cancer
vaccines) are now available for stimulating the immune system to fight
specific cancer cells.
 Deactivate the immune system: An over-reactive immune system can lit-
erally kill you when it’s acting like some out-of-control overachiever. In
allergy, immunotherapy has traditionally referred to treatments that
involve intentionally exposing people to what they’re allergic to —
essentially desensitizing them to specific allergens over time. Medical
professionals refer to this as “the development of immune tolerance” —
making the immune system more tolerant of allergens.
Taking a little hair of the dog that bit you may seem, at first, to be some
quack homeopathic treatment for allergies, but medical doctors have suc-
cessfully employed such treatments for almost a century.

Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

Getting your allergy shots . . . but not 
necessarily for food allergies
Allergy tests reveal what you’re allergic to: pollens, molds, or other allergens.
Once your allergist identifies the allergens that ail you, she can prepare and
administer allergy shots designed to make your immune system less sensitive
to those allergens. Allergy shots have been available for years but are primar-
ily used to treat environmental allergies, such as hay fever. Do they work on
food allergies? I get to that question later in the section “Treating food aller-
gies with allergy shots.”
You or someone you know probably has had allergy shots to treat everything
from hay fever to asthma. Following is a rundown of how a doctor typically
determines which shots you need and administers the shots:
1. Your doctor performs a series of allergy tests on you (see Chapter 5)
to determine what you’re allergic to.
2. Your doctor prepares the shots based on your allergy test results. In
other words, not all allergy patients receive the same shots.
3. After a build-up period that normally takes 6 to 12 months, your
doctor keeps you on a maintenance dose for the next 3 to 5 years.
Overall more than 80 percent of people with environmental allergies experi-
ence improvement with allergy shots. Allergy shots also have proven very
effective for people with allergies to bees and other stinging insects. 
Allergy shots rarely work for eczema and often worsen the condition.
Recognizing the downside
The major downside of allergy shots is that they can cause allergic reactions,
sometimes even dangerous anaphylaxis. This should not be surprising since
you’re actually being injected with the stuff you’re allergic to. In addition to the
risk of severe reactions, allergy shots often result in significant inconvenience:
 You have to get your shots at your doctor’s office. 
 You have to wait around for 20 to 30 minutes after each and every shot
to make sure you have no reaction.
 The doctor’s office must be equipped to deal with severe allergic 
reactions. 
155
Chapter 9: Exploring Cures from Mice to Man: Current Research

Some people cannot receive shots because their reactions are so severe, but
most allergy patients tolerate the shots just fine.
Treating food allergies with allergy shots
When you see such the high success rate for allergy shots in treating environ-
mental allergies (an 80 percent success rate), you may be tempted to jump to
the conclusion that drug companies would be able to develop similar vac-
cines for food allergy. 
Unfortunately, up to this point, the effectiveness of food allergy shots has
proven less promising, (see the sidebar above, “Food allergy immunother-
apy’s varied success”).
In the following sections, I describe the most promising new immunotherapy
approaches, realizing that the medical community still has a lot to learn and
that other methods may well be underway by the time you read these words.
What’s most promising is that food allergy research is accelerating at a very
rapid pace.
156
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 
Food allergy immunotherapy’s varied success
Doctors have used immunotherapy, in the form
of allergy shots, to treat food allergy success-
fully on a few occasions, including one report
published in 1930 of a child who was success-
fully desensitized to fish. In other studies, how-
ever, this form of treatment has proven too risky.
In the best study conducted to date — about ten
years ago at the National Jewish Hospital in
Denver — researchers tested immunotherapy
for the treatment of peanut allergy. The shots
were successful in that patients in the treat-
ment group were indeed able to tolerate
increased amounts of peanut in food challenges
after treatment. Unfortunately though, the
patients also experienced a high rate of allergic
reactions to the shots, and one patient who was
supposed to be in the placebo group acciden-
tally received a full dose of the peanut extract
and died. 
These results made it clear that standard
allergy shots for food allergy would not be a
practical option and that researchers needed to
break new ground. Extensive research has now
been conducted on the best ways to accom-
plish this, and we are now entering a new fron-
tier, putting different methods that have thus far
been tested only in animals to the test on
people. 

Going under the tongue with 
sublingual treatments
The membranes in your mouth can sometimes absorb trace amounts of a
substance without hitting you with a full dose. Researchers surmised that
perhaps by placing a small amount of an allergen under the tongue, the
patient could absorb just enough of it to help desensitize the immune system
without a significant risk of serious reaction. In some cases, this ten-year-old-
or-so theory has played out in practice through sublingual treatments.
Sublingual treatment consists of placing a tiny amount of allergen extract —
in the form of allergen drops — under the tongue, where the patient typically
holds it there for a minute or two and then either spits it out or swallows it. 
Researchers have performed over 200 studies to explore the effectiveness of
sublingual immunotherapy on environmental allergies, such as allergies to
pollens and dust mites, with very encouraging results. 
The great advantage of sublingual immunotherapy has been its safety record.
Although an itchy mouth is common, systemic reactions (reactions that travel
to other areas of the body) are so rare that patients can take these allergy
drops safely at home. The allergy community has shown great interest in
applying this form of immunotherapy to food allergy. The following sidebar
describes one study performed on hazelnut allergy.
157
Chapter 9: Exploring Cures from Mice to Man: Current Research
Finding hope in hazelnuts
A small but very important study published in
2005 focuses on the effectiveness of sublingual
immunotherapy in patients with allergy to hazel-
nuts. Twenty-three patients enrolled in the study
and were assigned to receive either hazelnut
immunotherapy or placebo. Researchers
assessed the effects of treatment by perform-
ing a controlled food challenge after 8–12
weeks of treatment. 
Twenty-two patients reached the planned max-
imum dose at 4 days. Researchers observed
systemic reactions in only 0.2 percent of the
total doses administered. In challenge testing,
the average amount of hazelnut it took to trigger
a reaction in the group that received sublingual
immunotherapy increased from 2.3 grams
before treatment to 11.6 grams after treatment.
Patients in the placebo group experienced no
improvement, as you’d probably expect.
Moreover, almost 50 percent of patients who
underwent active treatment reached the high-
est dose — a whopping 20 grams of hazelnut —
compared to only 9 percent in the placebo
group. 
This study, as well as several other small stud-
ies, have generated a great deal of excitement
about this type of treatment. Many more stud-
ies are in the works in the U.S. and abroad, and
we will be learning much more about this
promising treatment in the next few years.

Chewing on oral immunotherapy
Oral immunotherapy is similar to the sublingual method — you take gradu-
ally increasing doses of an allergen to desensitize your immune system to it.
Two key differences, however, set oral immunotherapy apart from the sublin-
gual variety. With oral immunotherapy
 You actually eat the allergen rather than tucking it under your tongue.
 You eat the food (or at least some concentrated form of the food pro-
tein) rather than an extract of the food. 
The basic procedure for administering oral and sublingual immunotherapy is
basically the same, except that in the case of oral immunotherapy, you actu-
ally consume the allergenic substance. Here’s how a typical oral immunother-
apy treatment is done:
1. Your doctor starts you on a miniscule amount of the food you’re aller-
gic to.
2. Over a period of weeks or months, your doctor gradually increases
the dose.
3. Assuming you can tolerate the dose you consume at the clinic, you
take that same dose daily at home for a period of days or weeks.
4. Assuming your symptoms don’t recur at home over that time, you go
back to the clinic for your next dose increase.
5. Once you’ve achieved the desired dose plateau, your doctor places
you on a dose that you continue to consume daily at home for a
period of months to years. Hopefully, you eventually achieve complete
and long-term tolerance.
A few preliminary studies on oral immunotherapy have provided very
encouraging results for milk, egg, and peanut allergy. We are currently con-
ducting oral immunotherapy studies for both milk and egg allergy with high
hopes that this method will prove to be both safe and effective. 
So, where do you go for oral immunotherapy? Unfortunately, neither oral nor
sublingual immunotherapy is likely to be approved for routine use in your
allergist’s office for at least five years, but I believe that someday one or both
forms of treatment will be approved. We need at least 5 years though to work
out the details, including how quickly to ramp up doses, how much of a food
to recommend as a maintenance dose, how long to continue treatment before
attempting a full-fledged food challenge, how to minimize the risks, and so on. 
158

Battling back with modified 
protein vaccines
While allergy shots and sublingual and oral immunotherapy expose you to
the complete proteins that cause your immune system to overreact, modified
protein vaccines expose you only to pieces of the proteins to reduce the risks
of severe reactions. A similar theory drives the development of other vac-
cines; for example, many anti-bacterial vaccines contain weakened or dead
bacteria that can trigger your immune system to develop the required anti-
bodies for fighting the disease without exposing you to the live, virulent 
bacteria.
Allergens are proteins comprised of long chains of amino acids. What your
immune system recognizes in a protein are small segments called epitopes
rather than the entire protein. The epitopes, which bind to IgE (and therefore
may be responsible for severe allergic reactions) are different from the epi-
topes that your T cells recognize. For a more technical discussion about the
role that T cells play and how modified protein vaccines affect them, check
out the following sidebar.
One food allergy treatment that uses a modified protein vaccine is called pep-
tide immunotherapy, which uses small protein fragments (peptides) that bind
to T cells. If appropriately designed, these peptide fragments would be
unable to bind to the IgE (binding would cause allergic reactions), but the
peptide fragments would still be able to stimulate suppressor T cells to
render helper T cells unresponsive to subsequent allergen exposure. 
Researchers have studied peptide immunotherapy in people with cat allergy
and discovered encouraging results. So far, however, researchers have tested
peptide immunotherapy for food allergy only in animals. In one such study,
two doses of a peanut peptide mixture were administered to peanut-sensi-
tized mice prior to performing a peanut challenge, and the mixture effectively
reduced the risk of anaphylactic reactions. More extensive desensitization
protocols are being investigated in mice, and the first human trials will hope-
fully begin in the next few years.
Mutating proteins to use in immunotherapy
Molecular biology and chemical engineering have made great strides in the
last few years. Humans can now modify genes, clone sheep, and engineer
smart drugs. We can even modify proteins to create mutant food proteins
unable to bind to IgE but quite capable of interacting with T cells.
159
Chapter 9: Exploring Cures from Mice to Man: Current Research

Understandably, some people may be a little hesitant to be injected with a
dose of mutant proteins, but the research shows some promise. 
Here’s how the genetic engineers managed to mutate peanut proteins to treat
people with peanut allergy:
 The three major peanut allergens — Ara h1, Ara h2, and Ara h3 — were
isolated and purified.
 IgE-binding and T-cell epitopes were mapped, and the DNA encoding
these proteins was isolated, sequenced, and cloned.
 Engineered proteins were then created that differed by a single amino
acid within each of IgE-binding epitopes. To IgE, this single amino acid
tweak makes these engineered proteins like the surface of a non-stick
pan, so very few of the proteins bind with the IgE antibody, but the pro-
teins stick to T cells like Velcro, so they’re still able to promote the
immune system’s suppressor T-cell responses, just like a bona-fide
peanut proteins. 
These engineered proteins have been tested on mice to determine their effec-
tiveness in preventing peanut anaphylaxis. Researchers sensitize the mice 
to whole peanut and then desensitize them using the engineered proteins.
Delivery by injection and both intranasal and rectal applications have now
been studied with dramatic results, taking mice with severe peanut allergy
and literally making the allergy go away. In fact, the rectal delivery appeared
most effective in mice, and these proteins are now being produced in a sup-
pository form to be tested in people, hopefully starting in 2007 or 2008. 
160
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 
Grasping the T-cell connection
T cells are white blood cells that fight infection.
Think of them as the brains of the immune
system. Anti-viral and antibiotic immunotherapy
seek to stimulate the immune system’s produc-
tion of T cells to fight invading viruses and bac-
teria by improving your immune system’s ability
to recognize a specific bacteria or virus as an
enemy invader. Allergy immunotherapy, on the
other hand, seeks to make the immune system
more tolerant of specific allergens in foods and
discourage it from springing into attack mode.
When you develop an allergy, one group of T
cells called helper T-cells instructs B cells to
produce IgE. Another group of T cells called
suppressor T cells turns off the immune
response. The theory behind allergy immuno-
therapy, whether using complete allergenic pro-
teins or modified proteins, works by stimulating
the suppressor T cells to mute the immune
system’s response to specific food proteins.

Designing protein molecules that minimize IgE binding while preserving their
ability to stimulate suppressor T-cells, should result in the availability of a
well tolerated and effective food allergy treatment. While most of these pio-
neering studies focus on peanut allergy, we could apply the same techniques
to other foods once the technology has been perfected. On the other hand, 
if treatments with intact proteins in sublingual or oral forms prove to be
equally effective, then we may not need to invest the time, effort, and cost 
to create these bio-engineered proteins. Only time will tell.
Treating like with like: Homologous protein immunotherapy
Homologous is a fancy word for “similar.” Researchers have known for a long
time that peanuts and soybeans are similar — they share family ties, because
they’re both members of the legume family. This kinship is also reflected at the
molecular level — their respective proteins share significant characteristics. 
These molecular similarities led some clever researchers to wonder if they
could create an immunotherapy treatment for peanut allergy out of soybean.
After all, soybean proteins can be viewed as natural mutants of peanut aller-
gens and therefore may function as effective desensitizing agents in allergen-
specific immunotherapy. 
To test this innovative theory, researches did what researches usually do: They
rounded up some mice — in this case, mice that had peanut allergy. They 
then administered soybean immunotherapy to some of the mice, peanut
immunotherapy to others, and a placebo to the third unfortunate group. What
did they discover? Eureka! 
 The placebo group still had the peanut allergy, which is no surprise. 
 The mice that received peanut immunotherapy (using peanut rather
than soy protein) experienced less severe reactions. Again, this is no
surprise.
 The mice that received soybean immunotherapy were as equally well-
protected as the mice that received peanut immunotherapy, and their
clinical symptoms were significantly reduced compared with the
placebo-treated mice.
If soybean immunotherapy can be used in patients allergic to peanuts and is
effective, the treatment would provide an immediate and better tolerated
therapeutic option for patients with peanut hypersensitivity. In addition, the
same strategy may be useful for treating other food allergies; for example,
chicken proteins may be effective in treating someone with egg allergy. 
161
Chapter 9: Exploring Cures from Mice to Man: Current Research

Going sub-cellular with DNA vaccines
Another novel approach to the treatment of food allergy currently under
investigation is called DNA immunization. DNA is the genetic material that
makes everything in nature unique. DNA immunization triggers the body to
produce the very proteins that it’s allergic to, leaving most people sarcasti-
cally responding, “Yeah, that’ll work.” 
The idea behind DNA immunization is that when the body produces the aller-
gen from within, the immune system no longer views the allergen as a foreign
invader, and hence has no reason to attack it. 
Here’s how it works:
1. Bio-engineers build DNA that codes for a specific allergenic protein,
such as peanut.
2. This DNA is injected into the allergy sufferer — at this point a mouse,
because we’re not sure yet how risky it is for humans.
3. The immune system receives the DNA, and the body begins producing
the allergenic protein.
This strategy has prevented the development of peanut allergy in mice, and
some evidence suggests that it may be able to muffle existing peanut allergy
in mice, as well. For food allergy, however, this therapy is far from ready for
human experimentation, but similar strategies are being used to treat other
diseases in people, including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease, so this
may not be as far fetched as it sounds.
Treating Your Allergies to an Ancient
Chinese Herbal Remedy
If you read through Chapter 8, you may think that I wouldn’t even give the time
of day to someone claiming that an ancient Chinese herbal remedy can cure
food allergy. Actually, I’m pretty open minded until research fails to uphold the
claims of snake-oil salesmen. In the case of a particular Chinese herbal remedy,
research has upheld the claims of Chinese medical practitioners.
Herbal remedies have been used in Asia for centuries for the treatment of
allergic diseases as well as for a huge number of other conditions. Several
recent studies have tested whether these formulas — the most recent of
which is called FAHF-2 (a combination of nine Chinese herbs) — are effective
162
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 

in treating peanut allergy in mice and to determine whether protection per-
sists after therapy is discontinued. The following items summarize the results
of various tests using FAHF-2:
 After challenges, all placebo-treated mice developed severe anaphylactic
symptoms.
 In five separate experiments, no sign of any allergic reaction was
observed in FAHF-2-treated mice. 
 IgE levels were significantly reduced in FAHF-2-treated mice and
remained significantly lower as long as five weeks after therapy. 
How do FAHF-2 and other herbal remedies do their thing? At this point, we
think that these herbal formulas contain some potent immunosuppressive
properties. The actual mechanism of how they work is still being studied.
Herbal therapies are now close to human trials. Needless to say, both doctors
and patients are showing a lot of interest in the results. Herbal preparations
for allergies are now undergoing detailed analysis required by the FDA to
ensure they do not contain any dangerous ingredients, but so far the safety
profile looks reassuring. How well will this work in people? How much would
an allergy sufferer need to take and for how long? These are all open ques-
tions at this point, but as we move closer to finding out the results of these
studies, we have a lot of room for enthusiasm.
Fighting Back with Anti-IgE 
Antibody Therapy
The problem with most approaches to allergen immunotherapy is that
they’re allergen-specific — they treat only one allergen, making treatment
complex and expensive for the many patients with multiple allergies. 
Wouldn’t a single therapy, one that would be effective for multiple inhalant
allergies as well as food allergies, be grand? Well, researchers are working 
on it. One such therapy, already in clinical trials, involves the use of anti-IgE
antibodies — bio-engineered IgG antibodies that bind freely to IgE, rendering it
powerless. Once the anti-IgE antibodies bind with IgE, IgE is unable to bind to
mast cells and basophils, so the massive release of histamine never happens. 
Several clinical trials involving patients with allergic rhinitis and allergic
asthma have been completed and one form of this treatment (omalizumab,
sold as Xolair) has now been approved since 2003 for treating allergic asthma
in adolescents and adults. 
163
Chapter 9: Exploring Cures from Mice to Man: Current Research

Results of studies on anti-IgE antibodies for food allergies show that the treat-
ment is promising but not yet completely effective, as described in the follow-
ing sidebar. 
Would Xolair (the drug that’s already available for asthma) work for food
allergies? We don’t quite know yet. Studies of Xolair for peanut allergy are in
the works but will not be completed for several years, so no anti-IgE product
will be approved for use for food allergy until these studies are completed.
Although theoretically Xolair and other anti-IgE therapies hold out some
hope, they have a few things working against them:
 Anti-IgE is not a vaccine or cure, merely a means of suppressing 
reactions.
 Anti-IgE needs to be given by injection at regular intervals — every
two to four weeks — to be effective, and once it’s stopped, the protec-
tion quickly disappears.
 Injections would be very expensive — about $1,000 dollars per dose
with no guarantee insurance will cover them. 
164
Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 
The TNX-901 study
A study of 84 patients with peanut allergy
treated with an anti-IgE product called TNX-901
was published in 2003. Patients received 150,
300, or 450 mg of anti-IgE or placebo by injec-
tion monthly for four months. All participants
had a peanut challenge before and after treat-
ment. In this study: 
 Participants receiving the highest dose of
anti-IgE experienced a significant decrease
in their symptoms. Those receiving a base-
line dose tolerated an average of about half
a peanut, while those receiving the highest
treatment dose were able to tolerate almost
nine peanuts. 
 About 25 percent of the participants, even
in the high-dose group, had no change in
peanut tolerance after treatment.
On the positive side, this study shows that anti-
IgE would clearly provide protection to most
patients with peanut allergy receiving the top
dose. The other potential benefit of this medi-
cine is that it is not specific for peanut allergy
— it should work for other food allergies in the
same manner and could also treat asthma and
allergic rhinitis at the same time.
On the negative side, TNX-901 appears to be
ineffective for about 25 percent of those with
peanut allergy. Moreover, due to some complex
legal issues, TNX-901 will never hit the market. 

 If the total IgE level (all IgE to all allergens circulating in your blood-
stream) is too high, anti-IgE therapy is ineffective. For asthma, Xolair 
is not approved for use if the total IgE level is over 800. Unfortunately,
many patients, including most patients with eczema and multiple food
allergies, have levels far higher than that. 
 Possible side effects require further investigation. Anti-IgE therapy has
not been studied in young children or in those with more severe forms
of peanut allergy. 
I feel strongly that anti-IgE therapy should be studied further and that it may
be of great value to some patients. In the long run, however, one or more of
the other forms of therapy described in this chapter are likely to have a
greater ability to truly treat food allergy and do so without a lifetime of ongo-
ing treatment. 
Investigating Other Futuristic Treatments
Immunotherapy, especially the bio-engineered varieties, is hi-tech stuff, but
other promising treatments are also being considered. In this section, I
describe some of the hopeful treatments currently in research and develop-
ment that you can expect to start hearing more about in the future.
Immunizing with immunostimulatory
sequences
Another take on the DNA immunization technique under investigation is immu-
nization with DNA that’s conjugated (linked) to small strings of amino acids,
forming what researchers fondly refer to as immunostimulatory sequences (ISS).
These ISS contain repeated sequences of two specific amino acids called cyto-
sine and guanine. In animal models, ISS stimulate the immune system toward
fighting infection while reducing its tendency to develop allergy. In addition,
they clearly have the ability to turn down, and possibly even turn off, existing
allergies. 
No studies on the effectiveness of ISS therapy on food allergy in people have
been done, but results from studies of ragweed allergy look very promising.
Studies with ISS conjugation to peanut and other allergens are likely to begin
in the next few years.

Chapter 9: Exploring Cures from Mice to Man: Current Research

Making the most of probiotics
Bacteria have a bad reputation. Commercials and news headlines constantly
disparage them for the role that a few black sheep in the bacteria community
play in causing infection. You rarely hear about the many good bacteria work-
ing to make the world a better place. But good bacteria do exist, and they
offer some hope in preventing the onset of allergies.
In scientific circles, these beneficial bacteria are often referred to as 
probiotics — live bacteria or their components that are reported to have ben-
eficial effects on health by improving the balance of bacteria in the intestine.
The major sources of probiotics are dairy products, including yogurt, that
contain Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. 
Although the concept of probiotic foods was introduced more than a century
ago, only recently have researchers evaluated probiotics in controlled clinical
trials in the treatment of food allergy. The following sidebar presents the
results of a couple of the more promising studies.
Most current interest in probiotics focuses on their potential to prevent food
allergy rather than turning off existing food allergy. Even their effectiveness
as a preventive is yet to be proven, but the theory makes sense and deserves
further study. The likelihood that these products can actually turn off the
immune system once the allergy has developed is small, especially compared
to some of the truly exciting therapies discussed in this chapter.

Part II: Progressing from Hives to Hope: Diagnosis and Treatment 
Going proactive with probiotics
Probiotics have proven more effective in pre-
venting the onset of food allergy than in suc-
cessfully treating existing food allergy. Two
studies reveal their beneficial effects:
 In infants and young children with milk
allergy, two-month treatment with probiotics,
along with a milk elimination diet, decreased
the severity of their eczema. 
 In another study, expectant mothers were
given either probiotics or placebo in preg-
nancy and during breastfeeding, as were
their infants for 6 months, starting on the
first day of life. At 2 yearsof age, 23 percent
of children were reported to have atopic
dermatitis (dermatitis caused by food
allergy) in the probiotic-treated group com-
pared with 46 percent in the placebogroup,
indicating that the probiotic had some effect
on theprevention of early atopic disease in
infants at high risk.

In This Chapter
 Ridding your house of allergenic foods
 Restocking the shelves with safer alternatives
 Brushing up on allergen-free cooking techniques
 Building your own information/emergency station
A
good part of the time you spend at home, family members are munch-
ing on something. Whether they’re grabbing a snack or sitting down for
a seven course meal, family members must work together to prevent aller-
genic foods from finding their way into the family member who has the food
allergy.
In this chapter, you discover ways to convert your home into a safe haven for
you or your loved one who has a food allergy. Here I discuss the pros and
cons of eliminating problem foods from your home. If you choose to keep the
problem foods around, I suggest ways of shelving and labeling them to avoid
accidental exposure and cross contamination. I show you how to stock up on
non-allergenic foods and ingredients, equip your medicine cabinet with effec-
tive allergy treatments, and build an information/emergency station that has
everything you need to prevent reactions and quickly respond in the event of
any reaction.
Dumping the Bad Stuff . . . or Not
When a family member has a severe food allergy, the natural impulse may be
to purge the household of all foods that can possibly trigger a reaction. While
that is certainly an option, other options are available, and only you and your
family can decide which option is best. 

Some families choose to evict all problem foods from the premises. Others
prefer eliminating only the riskiest foods. And some families opt for preven-
tion and education rather than an outright ban. All these options are valid. As
a family, you need to weigh the risks and benefits and decide for yourself,
taking the following considerations into account:
 The severity of the allergy.
 The practical difficulty of eliminating one food versus another.
 The overall quality of life for all members of the family.
 The presence of other children in the home. 
 The overall effects that a food ban may have on a child’s ability to deal
with food allergy in the real world.
In the following sections, I explore these deciding factors in greater depth.
Weighing the pros and cons 
of banning allergenic foods
When someone has a severe food allergy, and a miniscule amount of the aller-
gen can trigger a dangerous reaction, you may decide to completely ban the
food from your house. Most families with peanut allergy, for example, choose
to remove all peanut from the premises, primarily for two reasons:
170
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 
My personal preference
Most people develop beliefs based on their
experience and how they were raised. The
same is true for me. My views on how to
manage a food allergy in the home are strongly
influenced by the way my parents raised a child
with a severe peanut allergy — me.
My peanut allergy was first diagnosed when I
was still a baby. I grew up with seven brothers
and sisters, most of whom ate peanut butter
regularly. My father was, and still is, quite a fan
of roasted peanuts. With all that peanut in the
house, you may think I would be having reac-
tions all the time.
Actually, despite the fact that peanut was a
long-term resident in my house, I never had a
single reaction at home. With eight children
running around, my home was far from being a
calm, organized environment, but a series of
simple rules along with seven cooperative sib-
lings kept me safe.

 Peanut allergy often engenders a greater level of fear, especially a fear
that tiny exposures may lead to severe reactions.
 Most families find that they can give up peanut products without suffer-
ing any great hardship.
The situation for milk or eggs is often quite different. Although severe reac-
tions certainly occur with these foods, they are somewhat less common than
with peanut. More importantly, removing these foods from the home can
cause significant hardship for nonallergic family members. Hence, few fami-
lies living with milk or egg allergy choose to completely eliminate these foods
from their homes.
I never recommend that a family completely eliminate a food from the home. I
understand why families choose to do this, but it is rarely, if ever, necessary. I
believe that implementing reasonable precautions can create a safe environ-
ment even if the problem food remains in the home. I reveal the most effec-
tive precautions later in this chapter. 
Reducing the fear factor 
Keeping all problem foods in the home may even offer the additional benefit
of alleviating irrational fears. When allergic children are accustomed to living
around the foods that they’re allergic to, they naturally develop a more ratio-
nal respect for the possible danger. It’s like having a gas stove or candles in
your house. Children realize that the flame can harm them. They know not to
touch the flame or play with fire, but when someone lights a match, they
don’t go running and screaming out of the house.
I see children every week who are completely paralyzed by the fear of an
allergic reaction. They may panic when someone opens a candy bar across
the room, truly fearing that this will cause a reaction or even kill them. If the
same children had lived around the foods that they are allergic to, they
almost certainly would not have this irrational fear.
171
Chapter 10: Living at Home with Your Allergies
Justified fear
In spite of my general advice to keep allergenic
foods around the house, I understand why some
families decide to eliminate a food from their
home. Some families who’ve taken adequate
precautions and still have witnessed severe
reactions simply decide that the risk isn’t 
worth it.
I recently saw a patient with severe milk allergy.
The family had decided to keep milk in the
home. The patient’s brother, who is not allergic
to milk, drank a glass of milk when he probably
had some sort of stomach virus and proceeded
to vomit all over the place, including all over his
allergic brother. The milk-allergic brother turned
into a massive hive. 
No more milk in that home, and I really can’t
judge the parents for making that decision.

Other families have made the decision to ban certain foods because they
always think the worst. They imagine that a babysitter will find the jar of
peanut butter on the top shelf, where it is labeled with a skull and cross
bones with Jimmy’s picture on it, and decide to give it to Jimmy for a snack.
As unlikely as this might be, I cannot promise them that such an event would
never happen. This is exactly why the decision of whether to completely
eliminate a problem food from the home is a choice that every family needs
to make for itself.
Boosting the education factor
When families choose to keep a problem food in their home, they provide a
valuable learning experience for the person with the food allergy and for
other family members. The presence of the problem food creates a real-world
environment in which family members must:
 Read and decipher food labels.
 Wash their hands before and after eating.
 Scrub down counters and tables.
 Practice proper food preparation.
In addition, the person with the food allergy is required to develop some level
of self control to avoid problem foods that are readily available.
If you choose to eliminate problem foods from your home, and you have a
young child with food allergy, provide other educational opportunities. Teach
proper cooking techniques, practice reading food labels when you go grocery
shopping, and stress the need for washing hands and scrubbing down coun-
ters and tables before and after eating.
Quarantining suspect substances
If you decide to let allergenic foods hang out at your house, you may decide
to employ other strategies to protect the safety of the person who has the
allergy. The following safe practices are not hard and fast rules, merely some
ideas to consider implementing in your home:
 Segregate safe and unsafe foods: Designate a specific shelf in your cup-
board or pantry for safe foods and be sure that everyone understands
your system. You can similarly rearrange the items in your refrigerator.
 Label the problem foods: Special labels or stickers may provide an added
measure of safety. You can purchase food allergy labels or use your com-
puter or label maker to create custom labels that work best for you. 
172
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Labeling safe foods is often easier and more effective for a common food
allergy, like milk. Labeling unsafe foods is often more efficient when unsafe
foods are few as in the case of a peanut, tree nut, or sesame allergy.
 Designate allergen-free zones: Set rules that indicate where foods can
and cannot be eaten. For example, if one child is allergic to milk, you may
consider restricting the consumption of milk and other milk-containing
foods to the dining room or kitchen table. Otherwise, family members are
likely to spread milk all over the house.
 Designate places at the table: Consider establishing fixed seating
arrangements at the table, especially if young children are involved. An
allergy-free zone can reduce the chances that a child will share food or
pick items off another family member’s plate and lessens the chance of
exposure to scattered crumbs, spills, and splatters.
 Limit opportunities for cross-contamination: If allergic foods are kept in
the home, cross contamination is always a risk. All family members need
to be especially careful with utensils. Grabbing the same spatula to
serve a cookie that contains the allergen and using it to serve a cookie
that’s allergen free is a simple mistake that can lead to a severe reaction.
Likewise, family members must learn to never dip the knife they used to
spread their peanut butter into the jelly jar and to thoroughly clean the
cutting board after preparing any allergenic food. 
For additional tips and techniques to reduce the risks of cross contamination
and other risks inherent in preparing and serving food, see “Cooking and
Dining Safely in the Midst of Allergies,” later in this chapter.
Stocking Up on the Essentials
Maintaining an allergen-free diet takes care, planning, and diligence. Not only
do you need to make sure that your allergic family member has safe foods
and beverages on hand, but you also must consider the nutritional value of
the substitutes, especially for young children.
In Chapter 18, I suggest some nutritional substitutes for the most common
allergenic foods, and in the Appendix at the back of this book, I include a
selection of some of the most popular recipes from the Food Allergy and
Anaphylaxis network. For guidance on basic nutrition, check out Nutrition For
Dummies by Carol Ann Rinzler. 
Running out to the corner store for a quart of milk when your child relies on
soy, rice, or potato milk may not be an option. Stock up on any special substi-
tutes for problem foods, especially when substitutes are available only in cer-
tain stores.
173
Chapter 10: Living at Home with Your Allergies

Once you get in the swing of things, living with food allergies does get easier.
Ask and shop around for the stores that best serve you needs. A trip to a spe-
cialty store that has foods that you cannot find at your usual grocery store
once or twice a month may be a great help in keeping your shelves stocked
with nutritional goodies.
Before you head out to the grocery store, be sure to review Chapter 6, and
consider copying and packing the field guide for each food that you or your
family member is allergic to, so you are well-prepared to decipher the more
cryptic food labels.
Cooking and Dining Safely 
in the Midst of Allergies
For families who rid their homes of allergenic foods, food storage, prepara-
tion, cooking, serving, and eating is of very little concern. The risk of acciden-
tal exposure is virtually eliminated along with the problem foods. 
For those who choose to make the problem food part of their family, how-
ever, mealtime can be a real challenge. Not only do you have to sift through
the grocery store shelves to find suitable substitutes and flip through food
allergy cookbooks to discover recipes for palatable dishes, but you also have
to master some techniques for preventing cross-contamination — an aller-
genic food tainting a nonallergenic food — and other opportunities for acci-
dental exposure.
Preventive measures for cross contamination and accidental exposure apply
to five areas (see the section, “Reducing the risks of cross-contamination” for
more information on these preventatives):
 Storage
 Preparation
 Cooking
 Serving
 Eating
In the following sections, I briefly discuss the challenges of planning allergen-
free meals and then reveal ways to lessen the risks of cross-contamination,
airborne allergens, and other sources of accidental exposure.
174
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Planning your meals
In some families, everyone’s on a special diet. The doctor places dad on a
low-cholesterol diet. Mom decides to try the Mediterranean diet to shed a
few pounds. And teenage brother opts for the Atkins diet. The cupboards and
fridge are packed with an assortment of special foods, and mealtimes take on
the air of a food court, with everyone preparing their own special meal.
The same situation arises in many families living with food allergy. Many
processed foods are eliminated from the diet, and certain ingredients that are
staples for some family members become taboo for others.
Obviously, the most efficient solution is to round up the troops and convince
the entire family to get on the same menu page. With all the available substi-
tutes on the market and the allergen-free recipes provided at the back of this
book and elsewhere, you may be surprised to find that the rest of the family
actually prefers eating allergen-free. And, because allergen-free meals often
rely less on processed foods, they’re generally healthier than the meals you
may be used to serving. 
The process of planning and preparing allergen-free meals is especially both-
ersome for those who don’t like to cook. For those who enjoy cooking, how-
ever, perfecting an allergen-free recipe can really be fun. Try to make meal
preparation a family affair, getting everyone involved in picking recipes
they’d like to try, and then team up to perfect the recipes. 
Boning up on substitutions 
One of the tricks to allergy free cooking is finding suitable substitutes for
what you need to avoid. Over the past few years this market has grown
tremendously, so that for the most common problem foods, you can usually
find one or more excellent substitutes. Check out Chapter 18 for some of the
more common food and ingredient substitutes.
Because food companies are constantly developing new substitutes, don’t
settle for only the substitutes listed in Chapter 18. Scour the grocery store
and specialty store shelves for additional options. You may be pleasantly sur-
prised at the wide selection.
Reducing the risks of cross-contamination
Families that eliminate allergenic foods have little concern over cross-
contamination. Unless a neighbor, friend, or family member smuggles 
in a tainted dish, snack, or dessert, cross-contamination is a non-issue.
175
Chapter 10: Living at Home with Your Allergies

If your family has decided to establish a peaceful coexistence with the aller-
genic food, however, cross contamination becomes a significant concern. By
setting a few rules and implementing proper preventive measures, however,
you can establish a safe eating environment for your allergic family member.
One of the best ways to prevent cross-contamination is to focus on the areas
where it’s most likely to occur:
 Storage: Store all food in sealed containers. As long as the egg noodles
and the egg-free noodles are in separate, sealed containers, they’re
highly unlikely to contaminate one another. Be careful of leaky packages
or spills. A leaky milk jug stored on the top shelf can splash milk all over
the place, especially if you have leftovers wrapped in cellophane or alu-
minum foil or stored in unsealed containers.
 Preparation: Food preparation is a common source of cross-
contamination. Kitchen counters, cutting boards, knives, meat or cheese
slicers, spoons, measuring cups, mixing bowls, spatulas, and a host of
other food prep equipment can carry remnants of a problem food. To
reduce the risk, thoroughly clean cutting boards between foods. Likewise,
thoroughly clean all measuring spoons, mixing bowls, and other equip-
ment and utensils between preparing the safe and unsafe foods.
A cutting board made of plastic or another hard surface may be easier to
clean than a wooden cutting board. Some families use two cutting boards. 
 Cooking: The biggest risk with cooking involves shared utensils, so
clean utensils thoroughly between cooking safe and unsafe foods. As
you’re cooking, be particularly careful not to use the same spoon or
spatula on a safe food that you used on an unsafe food. Contamination
from spills or spatters is a lesser risk, as long as you keep the safe foods
you’re cooking a reasonable distance from the unsafe foods . . . and
don’t get too flip-happy with your spatula.
 Serving: With severe food allergies, even a trace of allergen on a spatula
can trigger a reaction. Clean serving utensils thoroughly, and never use a
utensil used to serve an unsafe food to serve a safe food. Remain extra
vigilant when you serve safe and unsafe foods at the same dinner table
to make sure the serving utensils remain with their respective serving
dishes.
Grounding airborne allergens
When allergens take flight, they can cause inhalation reactions, as I explain in
Chapter 3. Peanut dust, for example, can trigger even a severe allergic reac-
tion particularly if a person is eating shelled peanuts in close proximity to
someone with severe peanut allergy.
176
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

In the kitchen, airborne allergens pose a risk, because heat, spatters, splat-
ters, and steam can launch allergens into the surrounding air. When cooking
unsafe foods, the following conditions pose the greatest risk:
 High heat on an open stove: The greatest risk of a food allergen becom-
ing airborne occurs when you cook the food at high heat on an open
stove. The vapors and spatter that occurs can contain large amounts of
food protein that can cause reactions if you are in close proximity to the
cooking. Common examples of this would be frying an egg or hamburger
or stir-frying fish or shellfish.
 Steaming foods: The process of steaming foods may also release large
amounts of allergen. Steaming shrimp or crabs or boiling or roasting
peanuts can pose a huge risk.
 Prepping foods: Some foods become airborne during the preparation
process. Large amounts or wheat, for example, can cloud the air when
you’re baking a cake, kneading bread or pizza dough, or grinding up
peanuts or tree nuts. Professional bakers sometimes fall victim to a condi-
tion called baker’s asthma, triggered by a heavy exposure to wheat dust.
Airborne exposures are much less common when foods are baked or cooked
at lower temperatures. So while reactions related to frying eggs are common,
I have never heard of an airborne reaction from baking a cake.
To reduce the risks of airborne allergens, take the following precautions: 
 The person with allergies should keep a safe distance from the prepa-
ration or cooking area when unsafe foods are being handled. Staying
in the next room is almost always safe, and we rarely see reactions when
the person with the food allergy is more than five or six feet away.
 Install and use a well functioning exhaust fan on or above the stove.
This can make a huge difference.
 Allow at least 30 minutes for the air to clear after a problem food has
been prepared or cooked before the person with the food allergy re-
enters the room.
Cleaning the galley
Most household cleaners combined with a little elbow grease are sufficient
for removing food allergens from countertops, tables, and chairs. Following
are some tips for cleaning specific items, as well as a few potential problem
areas:
177
Chapter 10: Living at Home with Your Allergies

 Counters and table tops: You can effectively clean these rigid surfaces
with most household cleaners and elbow grease. Timing and diligence
are most important — clean immediately after all food preparation and
eating, and don’t skimp on the elbow grease.
 Sponges: Patients often ask whether the kitchen needs to be equipped
with two sponges, so an allergen-free sponge is always available. As a
general rule, I do not feel that this is necessary. Using a sponge to wash
dishes, even if the sponge is slightly contaminated does not pose a huge
risk, as long as you thoroughly rinse the dishes after washing them. With
counters and table tops, where rinsing is less of an option, thoroughly
rinse the sponge after cleaning up potential allergens.
 Dishes: Thoroughly washing dishes either in the sink or dishwasher is
usually sufficient for removing all allergens. When washing dishes by
hand, diligence, elbow grease, and a thorough rinsing are the key ingre-
dients to success. When using a dishwasher, carefully inspect all dishes
as you empty the dishwasher to be safe — stubborn allergens clinging to
dishes or a less powerful dishwasher can leave allergen residue on the
dishes.
 Cookware: Practice the same techniques for cleaning pots, pans, and
other cookware as you do for dishes. Some families choose to keep a
separate set of allergen-free pots and pans, but this isn’t really neces-
sary. As for loading your cookware into the dishwasher, however, I’m
less willing to trust the dishwasher unless you’ve done a pretty good job
of pre-cleaning your cookware. Stoneware or other pieces that are more
porous than the standard pot or pan may pose an additional risk,
although this has never been proven.
 Utensils: In general, follow the same precautions as those for cleaning
dishes and cookware, paying special attention to cooked-on foods and
the nooks and crannies characteristic of most utensils. Be especially
careful cleaning beaters and whisks, which are more likely to trap food
remnants.
 Dish rags, towels, and other fabrics: Though easy to clean — one run
through an average washing machine can loosen the grip of even the
most clingy allergen — kitchen rags, towels, and other fabrics pose a sig-
nificant potential risk. A dish towel used to dry a clean plate is certainly
nothing to worry about, but if someone used the towel to wipe up a spill
and then snuck it back on the hook, the towel could be very contami-
nated and transfer the allergen to that previously clean plate you’re
drying. 
 Tablecloths: Vinyl or plastic tablecloths are best, because the surface
doesn’t absorb the gunk. If you use a cloth cover, it can pose a risk,
especially in the case of liquid allergen spills, such as milk or egg. Again,
the best way to clean a cloth tablecloth is to run it through the washing
machine.
178
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

 Grills: For families who enjoy grilling out (or in), the grill is a potential
hazard. Grilling a safe food along with an unsafe food — for example, a
plain chicken breast alongside a breast marinated in soy sauce — could
result in cross-contamination from spatter. As for any allergen residue
remaining on the grill after cooking, I believe you can remove almost all
food residue by heating the grill back up to burn off the remnants and
then thoroughly scrubbing it with a wire brush. 
Heating and wire-brushing the grill, however, is not 100 percent safe. I’ve
seen a fair number of reactions traced back to a contaminated grill.
Following are some safer alternatives:
• Safe: Place a double-thick layer of aluminum foil over the area on
the grill where the allergic person’s food is being cooked. 
• Safer: For the more compulsive chef, a second, allergen-free grill
grate offers added protection.
• Safest: For the ultimate in compulsive grilling, a two-grill system is
the safest option. For all you grill cooks out there who want a new
grill, tell your significant other that the doctor said you really need
a separate grill for optimum safety.
Organizing an Information Station
Every family living with food allergy should have a minimum of one food
allergy emergency kit, complete with instructions, stored in a convenient cen-
tral location that everyone knows about. In addition, you may want to create
an allergy information center where you store additional information, recipes,
your doctor’s phone number, insurance information, and this book for quick
reference. 
In a family in which the parents are often not present, educating family mem-
bers and sitters and even perhaps neighbors is essential. Whoever’s in charge
needs to know the rules, emergency procedures, and where the medications
are stored.
In the following sections, I lead you through the process of gathering the
essential resources and medications, and making sure everyone knows where
to find them.
Assembling an emergency kit
Once you and your doctor have decided which medicines you should have
on hand in the event of a reaction, assemble an emergency kit with the fol-
lowing items:
179
Chapter 10: Living at Home with Your Allergies

 Medications, including an antihistamine and epinephrine autoinjectors if
your doctor prescribed them.
 Your Food Allergy Emergency Action Plan from Chapter 7, providing
clear, detailed instructions of what to do in the event of an allergic reac-
tion. (Review the plan regularly to make sure all information is current,
especially contact names and phone numbers.)
Store the emergency kit in a safe, convenient place, and make sure everyone
in the house knows where it is.
Most families decide to keep two emergency kits — one that sits at home and
one that travels with them. The travel kit may need to be a bit more compact
but should still contain all medications and instructions. A similar kit may
also make sense if your child spends lots of time elsewhere, such as at the
grandparents’ house. 
Bringing your sitter up to speed
Leaving your child with a baby sitter is always a bit nerve wracking but this
is multiplied by a thousand when your child has severe food allergies. Here
are some guidelines for making parents’ night out as safe and stress-free as
possible for all involved:
 Find a babysitter who may be more mature than the usual fare. Sitting
for a child with a severe food allergy is not an ideal entry-level position
for a 13-year-old. If you’re really lucky, you can find a college student or
other young adult. If you’re lottery-lucky, you may find someone who
has a food allergy, a sibling with a food allergy, or best yet, a nursing
degree.
 Tell the sitter exactly what your child is allowed to eat. Take-out
orders, special snacks, and treats are strictly off limits. Set the accept-
able food out as clearly as possible.
 Describe the foods that your child is allergic to, and make sure the
sitter understands the house rules on what she can and cannot eat
around your child. If you have two or more children, explain what
they’re to eat and not eat, point out the designated eating areas, and
review clean-up policies.
 Train the sitter on the treatment plan for a reaction. Show her where
the emergency kit is stored, and review the plan in detail, including how
to spot symptoms. Show her the epinephrine injector and demonstrate
its use with a trainer. Then ask her to repeat it all back to you and
demonstrate the injector, until you’re sure she “gets it.”
180
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

 Provide explicit details on how and when to contact you, as well as
phone numbers for other people who may be able to help in the event
of a reaction. This often includes a trusted friend or neighbor as well as
your doctor.
 Stress the importance of calling 911 in the event of an emergency. If
your child has a severe food allergy, make sure the sitter knows to call
911. If the epinephrine autoinjector is used, a call to 911 is mandatory. 
Put everything in writing, just in case your sitter needs a brief refresher
course on what to do and what not to do. If your child is older, he or she can
provide guidance. For younger children, consider using the form supplied in
Chapter 12 as is or slightly modifying it for the sitter.
When you first hire a sitter, consider having the sitter come over to spend
some time with your family and get a feel for the routine and the do’s and
don’ts. You may ask them to spend an afternoon as a “mother’s helper” so
they don’t feel like they’re being watched or interviewed the whole time. This
gives the sitter a real feel for your kids and hands-on experience with safety
routines. The visit is likely to make your kids feel more comfortable being left
with the sitter, as well. Many parents find this useful, and it may even be
more useful for parents with children who have food allergies. It can certainly
put you more at ease.

Eating Out and Traveling 
with Food Allergies
In This Chapter
 Remaining prepared when you’re away from home
 Dining out without breaking out
 Planning a vacation or other trip around your allergies
 Picking your eateries wisely
H
ome may be your safe haven when it comes to food allergies, but life
outside the confines of your abode is just too tempting to pass up. You
gotta get out and enjoy yourself, let your hair down, relax. When you have
food allergies, however, wandering far from the safety of home may bring
more anxiety than relaxation, and that’s perfectly understandable.
In this chapter, I try to relieve some of your anxiety by assisting you in prepar-
ing and packing for your excursion — whether you’re walking down to the local
diner to grab a bite to eat or flying across an ocean for business or pleasure.
Here I show you how to pack your medications, find out about medical facili-
ties available at your destination, become more aware of the challenges you’ll
face on the road, and read a menu and talk with the server before placing your
order at a restaurant. 
Preparing for Your Outing
A safe, anxiety-free outing requires some advanced preparation, especially if
you’re venturing out to an area where you’re not so sure the natives have an
abundant supply of foods and beverages you can safely consume.

In the following sections, I show you how to prepare for your excursion
across town, country, or seas. I remind you to pack your emergency kit,
advise you to stock up on staples (both food and beverages), and show you
how to properly identify yourself as someone who has a food allergy (just in
case you experience a severe reaction).
Toting your allergy emergency 
kit along with you
When you properly equip your home and educate family members about
food allergies, as explained in Chapter 10, your food allergy becomes a less
intrusive part of your life at home. You know that everyone knows the drill
and that your emergency kit is readily available at a moment’s notice.
Although you may not be able to establish the same comfort level for times
when you leave the house, you can establish a good level of safety by plan-
ning and packing for emergencies. Make it a habit:
 Pack a travel bag with your emergency medications. See Chapter 10
for a list of items to pack.
 Before you leave the house, grab your bag just as habitually as you
put on your shoes.
You can toss your emergency medical kit in your car, but make sure you don’t
expose the medicines to extreme heat or cold, which could make them less
effective. Also make sure that if you park your car and then wander some dis-
tance from it, that you take the medical kit with you. 
Any time you leave the house, even if you’re not planning to eat out, always
bring your emergency medicines with you. In the old days, people ate three
meals a day, generally at scheduled times. Nowadays, food is readily available
at any time of day or night . . . even in the wee hours of the morning. Eating —
and a possible reaction — can happen anytime. Of course, you don’t even
have to be eating for a reaction to occur — airborne or contact exposure can
trigger a reaction, so always be prepared. Travel and eating out, however,
clearly add risk to the equation so it is even more important that you prepare
for the worst in these situations. Many of the reported food-induced anaphy-
lactic events and even fatalities have occurred in individuals with food
allergy who did not have their emergency medications with them at the time
of the allergic reaction or the medication treatment plan was not followed
appropriately.

Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Packing a safe food stash
When wandering off to uncharted territory, you never know what the natives
of that region eat . . . or which fast food restaurants are readily available, so
pack some safe provisions just in case. 
Safe foods to pack depend primarily on the food allergies you have and where
you’re going. If you have multiple food allergies, especially to common foods
such as milk or egg, eating out can be a huge challenge and you may need to
pack lots of food. For more isolated food allergies — even severe allergies like
peanut or tree nuts — you can usually find plenty of safe foods no matter
where you go, so you can pack light.
Wearing a medical ID bracelet or necklace
Venturing out on your own always increases the risk that you won’t receive
proper emergency treatment if needed. When traveling with others, always
let your travel companions know about your food allergies and what to do in
the event of a reaction. When traveling solo, wear a medical ID bracelet or
necklace. If you have a severe reaction and can’t tell others what’s happen-
ing, they can quickly tell from the bracelet or necklace what’s happening. The
best feature of the bracelet is that it contains a toll-free (800) number that’s
accessible from just about anywhere.
I recommend that you wear your medical ID bracelet or necklace at all times,
so you don’t forget to put it on before stepping out. If you prefer to wear it
only in situations in which you may be taking on some added risk, eating out
and traveling are at the top of the list. You can order food allergy ID bracelets
on FAAN’s Web site at www.foodallergy.org. ID bracelets and necklaces
are available in a variety of styles and designs to satisfy the requirements of
the most style-conscious patients. If you just can’t bear the thought of wear-
ing an ID bracelet or necklace, carry an emergency ID card in your purse or
wallet.
Taking Your Allergies Out to Dinner 
Eating out is a little risky whether or not you have a food allergy. In most
restaurants, all the food preparation occurs in the back room. You never
really know what the cooks and other staff are doing back there. You don’t
know where the food came from, how it was stored, or how it was handled.
185
Chapter 11: Eating Out and Traveling with Food Allergies

All you know is that when the server sets the plate in front of you or hands
you your to-go bag, the food looks and smells yummy.
When you have a food allergy, you place even more trust in the restaurant.
Cooks and other kitchen staff must be particularly careful to avoid any ingre-
dients that contain the allergenic food and to prevent cross-contamination
via unclean cooking surfaces or utensils. Even a splatter or airborne particles
of an allergenic food can land in your dinner dish if the cooks and servers
aren’t careful.
In the following sections, I guide you through the process of weighing the
pros and cons of eating out and provide some guidelines to ensure a safer
experience when you do decide to eat out. 
To eat out or not to eat out . . . 
that is the question
The risks of eating out vary with your food allergy. If you have a severe milk
allergy, even the most allergy-friendly restaurant may not be safe enough —
it’s just too easy during the hustle and bustle of a lunch or dinner rush for
someone back in the kitchen to slip up. If, however, you can find a restaurant
where the personnel take special care — down to using separate pans and
utensils — you may be relatively safe.
I know of a few restaurants that have mastered allergy-free cooking, so I know
that running such an establishment is possible. It just takes more time and
work than most restaurants are willing to commit. 
Even when you’re eating out at a restaurant where you are completely confi-
dent that the chef is following all necessary precautions, keep your emer-
gency medications close at hand.
If you own or work in a restaurant or the owner of your favorite eatery wants
to learn more about allergy-free cooking, the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis
Network, the Food Allergy Initiative, and the National Restaurant Association
have worked together to develop an excellent education program called Food
Allergy Training Guide for Restaurants and Food Services. You can order it
online at www.foodallergy.org or call the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis
Network at 800-929-4040. I believe that the rising prevalence of food allergies
along with programs such as these and the growing willingness of restaurants
to cooperate will lead to restaurants with increased allergy awareness where
those with food allergies can dine more safely.
186
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Locating allergy-friendly restaurants
Locating an allergy-friendly restaurant is often mainly a process of elimina-
tion. Allergic to fish or shellfish? Cross seafood restaurants off your list. 
Even if you’re ordering off the Turf side of the menu, the chances of cross-
contamination from the Surf foods is just too great. Allergic to peanuts or 
tree nuts? Avoid Asian restaurants. Nuts are all too common in Asian dishes.
Don’t let temptation overrule your natural avoidance instincts.
Because peanut allergies tend to cause more severe reactions, I provide a
special restaurant guide for peanut avoidance in Chapter 4 along with other
tips and tricks to avoid accidental exposure.
Taking the restaurant’s attitude pulse
When it comes to food allergies, restaurant personnel have attitudes, either
good or bad. Ideally, when you inquire about allergen-free foods, the server,
cook, and manager are receptive, knowledgeable, caring, and sensitive. Many
of the restaurants that fit this description are run by managers who have
food allergies or have a close family member with food allergies.
Unfortunately, you may not be so lucky to find such a restaurant. Many
restaurants would prefer that you never showed up. The servers and cooks
may even act ignorant, rude, and otherwise uncooperative. When you find
yourself in such a situation, the best response is usually to go elsewhere. You
may be able to whip the restaurant into shape but, in the meantime, you may
be taking unnecessary risks.
Avoiding the riskier eateries
Some restaurants and other eateries are simply not conducive to allergen-
free dining. Following are several types of establishments that may pose a
higher risk:
 Buffets: Observe a buffet for about two minutes, and you immediately
know why buffets are high-risk areas for patrons with food allergies. The
foods in the buffet line rub elbows. People can’t find the spoon for the
potatoes, so they serve up their spuds with a spoon that was sitting in
the egg noodles. Messy patrons fling the food around as though they
were having a food fight.
 Bakeries: In addition to the risk of airborne allergens, particularly for
people with wheat allergy, bakeries are notorious for cross-contamination.
Baked goods often sit next to or on top of each other in large display
cases. Tongs and other serving utensils are often shared and reused. In
such an enclosed environment, allergens easily spread from one food to
another. 
187
Chapter 11: Eating Out and Traveling with Food Allergies

 Restaurants that serve pre-made foods: Restaurants that cook meals
from scratch are best. You tell the chef which ingredients to use and
which ingredients not to use, and that’s what you get. Some restaurants
get pre-made entrees that they slap together to create your meal. Call
ahead and ask if the chef cooks the meals from scratch or uses pre-
packaged meals.
Giving fast-food restaurants a thumbs up
Fast-food and franchise restaurants have gotten somewhat of a bad reputa-
tion lately, but they offer some advantages for those with food allergies:
 Standardized food preparation and cooking procedures ensure that
meals are likely to be the same at all locations.
 Most larger restaurants have Web sites where you can study the ingre-
dients in detail before you go.
 Larger restaurants often share less equipment. While most restaurants
use the same deep fryer for multiple foods, many fast food joints use
dedicated oils, at least for their French fries. So while another restaurant
might be frying shrimp or mozzarella sticks in the same oil as the fries,
at a fast-food or chain restaurant, your fries are more likely to be fried in
fries-only oil, but ask to make sure.
Avoiding the risks of airborne exposures
With all the activity and the variety of foods at most restaurants, airborne
allergens also pose a possible risk, particularly if you’re sensitive to airborne
allergens. To limit the risk, take the following precautions:
 Be on the lookout as soon as you walk through the door. The waiting
area may have allergy-unfriendly snacks, such as peanuts in their shells.
 Ask to be seated at a table far from the kitchen, especially if the
kitchen is open to the dining room. Sitting close to the kitchen exposes
you to a higher concentration of airborne allergens, including milk, egg,
peanut, wheat flour, fish, shellfish, and meats. Cooking launches most
airborne allergens, but food preparation accounts for its fair share —
chopping nuts, beating flour in a mixing bowl, kneading bread, or rolling
pie crusts. 
 For those with milk allergies, steer clear of the cappuccino maker.
Patients can have airborne reactions in areas where milk is being frothed. 
Chatting it up with the staff
Allergen-free dinners out start not with the food but with the restaurant’s
staff. When you book a table at a restaurant, tell the person who’s reserving
the table about your food allergy. Ask the person to ask the chef whether she
188
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

can provide you with a meal that doesn’t contain the food you’re allergic to. If
the person is not sure, consider eating at a more accommodating restaurant. 
When you arrive at a restaurant, make sure the waiter or waitress knows
about your allergy and how serious it is. If you are not confident that they
understand how important it is for you to avoid a particular food, then look
for another restaurant.
Despite careful planning, not all the pertinent information you provide may
be accurately relayed to the chef. One way to ensure that the chef is made
aware of your food allergy is to prepare a chef card. A chef card is a personal-
ized card on which you list the foods you’re allergic to and related ingredi-
ents, as well as ways to avoid cross-contamination from utensils, surfaces,
and other dishes in the kitchen. 
Use the sample chef card shown in Figure 11-1 as your guide. Make copies
and keep the chef cards in your wallet or purse. You can personalize your
chef cards by using bright colored paper, designing your own cards, or lami-
nating the chef cards. When you go to a restaurant, give a chef card to your
server and ask him or her to share it with the chef.
Even a tiny amount of these foods can cause a reaction. Please clean any utensils,
pans, counters, cooking surfaces, and other equipment thoroughly before preparing
my meal, and do not prepare my food near any of these foods items.
Thank you for helping to keep me alive.
In the event of a reaction, take the following actions:
I carry an EpiPen. Grab tube in your fist with the gray activation cap
near thumb. Remove gray activation cap. Jab tip firmly into my outer
thigh (through my pants), hold there for several seconds, and then
gently massage shot area. Call 911.

Chapter 11: Eating Out and Traveling with Food Allergies

Your chef card doesn’t take the place of asking questions or careful planning
when you’re ordering at a restaurant. Chef cards can’t guarantee an allergen-
free dining experience, but they can help make your meal safer.
A few Web sites have chef cards already made up. The Food Allergy Initiative
offers several food allergy cards in several languages for eating out at more
exotic restaurants. Most of these pre-fab cards are useful, but they often con-
tain a list of the top allergenic foods — you place a check mark next to the
foods you’re allergic to. With so many foods listed on the card, this can be a
little confusing. I prefer creating a custom card that shows only the foods
you’re allergic to. However, if you’d like to check out these other cards, visit
the following sites:

 www.foodallergyinitiative.org (click the Downloads link)
 www.achooallergy.com/foodallergycards.asp
Studying the menu for safe dishes
A menu is not a cookbook. A menu usually tells you the name of the dish, a
brief list of the main ingredients, and the price. Rarely can you tell from the
brief menu description what the chef’s secret ingredients really are. To safely
order, be as selective when choosing an entrée as you are when choosing a
restaurant, ask plenty of questions, and watch out for hidden ingredients:
190
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 
Ask before you eat
“Ask Before You Eat” is the advice that New
Jersey’s Department of Health and Senior
Services (NJDHSS) and researchers at Rutgers
University’s Food Policy Institute and Department
of Nutritional Sciences offer to people with food
allergies.
That simple bit of advice is your best protection
against accidental exposures and cross-
contamination. Unless the restaurant staff is
fully aware of your food allergies and is well
informed on how to properly prepare food to
prevent cross contamination, you can’t really
expect them to serve you a safe meal. 
For more about the Ask Before You Eat program,
check out www.foodallergy.rutgers.
edu.

 Read the menu carefully. If the food you’re allergic to appears in the
name of the dish, cross it off your list. Remember that the food might
not be mentioned in the dish’s name or description, so always check
with the waiter or waitress. 
 Ask what’s in it. Tell your server what you’re allergic to and then ask
which items on the menu do not contain the problem food. Ask about
the specific ingredients used to prepare a particular dish. If your server
doesn’t sound sure, ask to speak to a manager or chef. Ideally, let the
restaurant know about your food allergy before you arrive. 
 Ask how the food is prepared. The way the food is prepared often influ-
ences how safe it is to eat. Make sure the server and the chef know not
to share cooking equipment, including deep fryers, or utensils between
your food and other foods being prepared or cooked. Let them know the
dangers of cross-contamination from spills or splatters. 
 Keep it simple. Ordering pure, basic foods is best. A flame-broiled steak
without sauce and some plain green beans are unlikely to cause a reac-
tion. A casserole or anything else that contains a mix of ingredients is
more likely to contain something you don’t want.
 Pass on the sauce . . . or get it on the side. Sauces are great hiding
places for allergens. A sauce is likely to contain peanuts, fish, milk,
wheat, or any number of hidden ingredients. Order your sauce on the
side. Better yet, forego the sauce altogether.
 Ask about the dressing. Most dressings contain oils, and many salads
contain nuts or seeds, even if you can’t see them. Ask which oils have
been used in the dressings. If you have milk or egg allergy, ask if the
dressings contain mayonnaise. Ask if the salad contains nuts or seeds.
Even if you’re ordering the fruit salad or chicken salad, you still need to
ask these questions.
Be particularly careful around anything that contains a mix of ingredients,
including sauces, crackers, and breads. These foods often contain hidden
ingredients, such as:
 Almonds (in your marzipan; a sweet paste often used as cake filling or
topping)
 Fish sauce (in Thai dishes)
 Milk (in some crisps)
 Oyster sauce (in Chinese food)
 Peanuts (in Satay sauce; an Indonesian sauce in which you typically dip
your meat)
191
Chapter 11: Eating Out and Traveling with Food Allergies

 Sesame seeds (in hummus)
 Tree nuts or peanuts (often used in sauces and in dessert toppings or
fillings)
 Wheat flour (in soups or sauces)
Explain to the server the seriousness of your food allergy. The server may
not completely understand the potential danger until you stress it. Also, let
the server know that allergens often exist in foods as hidden ingredients.
Continue to talk with the server until you’re confident that the person under-
stands and is qualified to serve you safe food. If your server doesn’t seem to
“get it,” and you’re not confident that you’re getting through to him, speak
with the manager or chef to assure that the meal you are ordering will be safe
to eat. 
Stepping gingerly across the dessert menu
You made it through dinner without the slightest hint of a reaction. Now, you
can kick back, relax, and reward your successful vigilance with a sinful dessert.
Whoa! Not so fast. That dessert menu may tempt you with some of the riskiest
foods in the building, whether you are allergic to milk, egg, wheat, peanut, tree
nuts, or even seeds. They are risky for three big reasons:
 Desserts frequently contain one or more key allergens, often as a
hidden ingredient. Very common examples would include finely ground
peanuts or tree nuts in a pie crust, a cake the contains a nut extract, or a
pastry that has been “washed” with egg whites. These could all produce
deadly exposures. 
 Desserts are at high risk for cross-contamination, all the way from the
mixing bowl to your plate. Pastry chefs, particularly in small bakeries
or restaurants, commonly bake like most people do at home — they use
the same mixing bowl, cookie sheet, spatula, and serving utensils for all
their desserts, without washing them thoroughly in between. Even if the
dessert comes from a larger manufacturer, we see lots of reactions
related to the serving utensil or ice cream scoop used at the restaurant.
 Many restaurants do not actually make their own desserts and there-
fore often have no knowledge as to what they are really serving.
Restaurants often buy their desserts from pastry shops and others who
specialize in desserts.
I always save dessert for home, where we can make something that we know
will be safe. To some, this may seem unnecessarily cautious, but as a group,
desserts count for far more reactions than foods from any other menu cate-
gory. Why risk ruining a lovely, safe dinner by topping it off with a risky
dessert? 
192

Traveling with Your Allergies
Travel poses a challenge for everyone. You have to plan ahead, reserve
accommodations at your destination, pack all the stuff you need, and, if
you’re flying, make sure you get to the airport in plenty of time to check in
and weave your way through security.
For those with food allergy, travel is far more challenging, and the more
severe and complicated the allergy, the more challenging it becomes. In the
following sections, I act as your food allergy travel guide, to assist you in
planning a safe and enjoyable journey. 
Whenever you travel, consider carrying a signed medical release giving
people permission to administer emergency medications, including epineph-
rine. Some people are so afraid of being sued if something goes wrong, that
they refuse to intervene, even when someone is at risk of dying. You can pick
up a sample release at www.foodallergyinitiative.org (the Food
Allergy Initiative provides medical releases in several languages). 
Plotting your course and itinerary
Your food allergy doesn’t monopolize your travel plans, but it may influence
them. In the following sections, I provide some general guidance on traveling
that covers both domestic and foreign travel. Later in this chapter, I offer
some tips on traveling with your food allergies to foreign lands.
Picking your mode of travel — by air or by land?
When you’re traveling on a tight schedule to a distant destination, flying may
be the only mode of travel that makes sense. When driving is an option, con-
sider the benefits — you can pack more of your own food, choose your
restaurants more carefully, and you don’t have to risk sitting elbow-to-elbow
with someone who decides to snack on a food that you’re sensitive to in the
middle of the trip.
Getting on the plane with your meds
If you decide to fly, be prepared for airline regulations that govern medica-
tions and foods you need to carry with you. Prior to your flight, ask your
doctor to write a letter explaining why you need the items you’ve packed.
Some baggage inspectors are sticklers, and they may require an official letter.
With my own epinephrine, in all the flights I’ve taken (and I’m a frequent
flyer), I’ve only been questioned five or six times. Only once would I have
193
Chapter 11: Eating Out and Traveling with Food Allergies

been unable to carry the medicine on board without a letter. Still, you should
always carry a letter to the airport, just in case. I’ve had to fax or email let-
ters to patients all around the world to get them past security.
Make sure your medications are in their original packaging. Be particularly
careful that prescription medications are in their prescription bottles.
Staying with family or at a hotel?
When you’re traveling to see relatives, family accommodations are usually
best . . . assuming, of course, that the family you’re visiting understands food
allergies and is supportive. With family, you have kitchen privileges for
preparing your own meals and plenty of storage space for special foods.
On the other hand, some families just don’t get it when it comes to food
allergy. If you’re family just doesn’t get it, when every trip to their home is
like navigating a mine field, you may be better off staying elsewhere (while
you, of course, try to gently instruct them about food allergy).
Following the crowds or roughing it in remote destinations?
When you’re going on vacation, you may have several destinations from
which to choose. Some people enjoy the hustle and bustle of big cities, major
attractions, and locations that attract tourists — places where emergency
medical treatment is readily available. Others prefer the solitude of remote
areas — some so remote that you’d need to aerial-drop emergency medica-
tions to the site. 
Which do I recommend? It’s pretty much a toss-up. You may think that popu-
lous areas are safer because of their better access to emergency medical
care, but remote locations offer some benefits. Every year, I have a number of
teenagers in my practice who want to go on camping or canoeing or outward
bound trips. While this often causes outright panic for their parents, I remind
them that if all their teenagers can eat is what their parents put in their back-
pack, they are much less likely to have a reaction than eating out at local
restaurants.
You may be dealing with other allergic conditions along with food allergy, such
as asthma or eczema. If you have found that one climate or environment is par-
ticularly good or bad for your health, be mindful of this as you draw up your
plans. I have several patients who travel to the same, family-favorite vacation
spot year after year and call me every year to report a severe asthma attack. I
wonder how this destination manages to remain a family favorite when they
visit the local emergency room almost as often as they see me.
194
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Planning your meals
When you’re on vacation, one of your primary goals is to leave drab daily
routines behind. With food allergies, however, your daily routines are often
your best protection. 
Although I don’t want to ruin your trip by suggesting that you click back into
your daily eating routine, some careful planning can enable you to vary your
diet while remaining reaction free. Staying safe requires a combination of
packing safe foods, reading labels when you go shopping, and carefully
reviewing and choosing restaurants.
Scoping out allergy friendly grocery stores
When traveling to an unknown place that isn’t exactly a thriving metropolis,
you may have trouble finding a grocery store that carries the allergen-free
foods to which you’ve become accustomed. 
Consider scoping out such areas prior to departure. If you have a computer
with Internet access, search Google for “grocery store” followed by the desti-
nation city and state or zip code to view a list of grocery stores in the area.
You can also search online phone books, such as YellowPages.com at www.
yellowpages.com.
If you’re traveling to a remote destination that has limited access to grocery
stores, you may have to stock up on your own food supplies before depart-
ing. See “Packing a safe food stash” earlier in this chapter.
Lining up a motel with a kitchenette
Most families with food allergy, especially if milk, egg, wheat, or soy are
involved, prefer to prepare most, if not all, of their own meals. If you cannot
stay with friends or family, this is going to be much easier to accomplish if you
can stay in a hotel or motel with a kitchenette. Thankfully, these have become
more and more common in recent years and generally a whole lot nicer.
When you arrive, take a close look at the facilities and inspect for cleanliness.
Food residue may be present on pots and pans, dishes, cutting boards, and
so on. If the kitchen or the cooking equipment appears suspect, ask the hotel
or motel personnel to clean it up prior to the time you plan on cooking your
first meal.
Checking out the local restaurants
Researching a few safer local restaurants before departing on your journey is
a good idea. Using a combination of guide books and the Internet, you can
draw up a list of restaurants that sound good to you and then start calling the
restaurants to get a feel for which ones would be most accommodating. 
195
Chapter 11: Eating Out and Traveling with Food Allergies

Follow the same guidelines for choosing restaurants at your destination that I
provide earlier for selecting local eateries (see “Taking Your Allergies Out to
Dinner”). When you arrive, take the usual steps described previously. By
preparing in advance, you’re much more likely to start your trip right, rather
than having a total meltdown before you’ve even had your first meal.
Scoping out available healthcare providers
I have one family that travels everywhere they go with a map noting every
emergency room on the route they are taking. While this is a bit extreme, and
more than is necessary, having some knowledge of available healthcare facili-
ties is not a bad idea. 
Thankfully, in the United States, most hospitals are very capable of dealing
with an allergic reaction. The biggest issue is having some idea of how far
away from help you are so that you and your doctor can plan accordingly. 
For example, if you’re far from medical attention, you may need to have addi-
tional doses of medicine available so that you can deal with a reaction as you
wait for help to arrive.
Flying to foreign lands: 
international travel
When traveling in your own country, you’re well-schooled in what you have
to deal with and how to deal with it. Food labels, although they may be a little
cryptic, are fairly standard. You’re familiar with the protocol of communicat-
ing your needs to restaurant servers and chefs. You know who to call and
how to call in the event of an emergency.
When you travel to a foreign land, however, you’re journeying to unfamiliar
territory. You’re unfamiliar with the way they do things, and they’re unfamil-
iar with you. Even more challenging is the fact that the food they eat may be
entirely different from what you’re accustomed to.
Confronting problems in foreign lands
The following items can make you more aware of the issues you face when trav-
eling to foreign lands and bring you up to speed on some possible solutions:
 The problem food is in everything! In Asian countries, you’re going to
be dealing with a lot of peanut. In Israel, sesame permeates the menu. In
Japan, fish is the staple. You may not need to cross a destination off the
list, but you may need to pack a lot of your own food. Just make sure
you can get through the customs check with the food you bring.
196
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

 You don’t speak the language. Eating out safely requires an ability to
communicate your allergy and your needs to the server and chef. If you
don’t speak their language, you may not be safe eating out at the local
establishments. Sometimes, a chef’s card in the local language can help —
check out the cards at www.foodallergyinitiative.org. To further
complicate matters, the locals may speak different languages or dialects.
 You don’t read the language. Ever try grocery shopping in China, Japan,
Germany, France, Russia? Those people have the gall to label their foods
in something other than English! Well, that’s obviously a problem, but
even English-speaking countries can pose a problem with their food label-
ing. Food labeling in Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand
is typically excellent and in some instances better than in the U.S.
Elsewhere, labeling may be limited at best. Stick with basic fresh foods.
 Emergency medical care may not be very accessible. Before you
depart, meet with your doctor, tell her where you’re going, and discuss
your concerns. Stock up on special medications, if needed, and obtain 
a letter from your doctor stating that you need to carry these specific
medications. Makes sure all medications are labeled appropriately.
Tweaking your emergency action plan
Chapter 7 provides an emergency action plan. That plan is designed for
home, work, school, and local travel. If you’re traveling outside the country
or to a remote location in your country of residence, adjust your plan to treat
reactions more aggressively:
 Pack lots of epinephrine. You should have at least three doses and
maybe more depending on the length of your stay and your ability to
obtain more. Prior to leaving on your trip, ask your doctor under what
conditions you should administer a second or third dose.
 Pack lots of antihistamines. Benedryl is usually the antihistamine of
choice, as discussed in Chapter 7.
 Pack a steroid, such as prednisone. In most cases, you don’t get the
steroid until you’re in the emergency room. When traveling to a place
where the emergency room is inaccessible, you should have your own
supply ready to go. Consult your doctor about the use of the steroid —
when to take it and how much to take.
 Respond immediately to reactions. Don’t even think of taking the wait-
and-see approach. Administer epinephrine immediately.
Surviving the long flight
A two- or three-hour flight can be a little uncomfortable, but when you’re 
airborne in close quarters for 12 hours a more, the discomfort seems to rise
exponentially. When you have a food allergy, the risk of reaction also tends to
increase. When you’re going to be on a long flight, take a few extra precautions: 
197
Chapter 11: Eating Out and Traveling with Food Allergies

 Pack food. I’m not about to bash airline food, but when you have food
allergies, you can’t trust it, particularly on international flights. 
 Carry on your medications. Don’t check the bags that contain your
medications. Carry them on with you, so you have them on the flight,
and, if your bags are lost in transit, you have the medications when you
reach your destination. 
 Inform the flight crew. The flight attendants should know that you have
a food allergy, and they should be aware of what to do if you experience a
reaction in flight. Often, the flight crew will ask if a doctor or other type 
of medical professional is on board the flight who would be willing to
respond to your needs. This is another situation in which you should be
prepared with extra doses of medicine and an appropriate action plan.
Flying with peanuts: avoiding 
peanuts on your next flight
Peanuts used to be as common on airplanes as they are at baseball games,
making flying especially nerve wracking for people with peanut allergy. When
passengers are packed tighter than sardines on a flight for several hours, and
the attendant starts handing out bags of peanuts, you may start eying that
emergency door and hoping you had a parachute handy. 
In most cases, peanut on flights does not pose a significant risk. I fly often,
frequently on international flights, and I’ve never had an in-flight reaction.
Others have, however. Most of these reactions are caused by eating some-
thing that contains peanut on the flight. Far fewer reactions are caused by
contact, and inhalation reactions are rare. Check out Chapter 4, where I dis-
cuss the risk of peanut dust in greater detail.
I’ve personally flown hundreds of times without any difficulty, and I have a
very severe peanut allergy. To remain safe, however, always have emergency
medication available. Although policies are forever changing, most airlines
are willing to make some accommodations for those with peanut allergy,
either by offering peanut-free flights or peanut-free buffer zones. Visit the
FAAN Web site (www.foodallergy.org) for up-to-date information on spe-
cific airline policies. Even though I personally do not take these precautions, 
I think that peanut-free accommodations are a reasonable request for most
families. If, however, you cannot find such a flight, or you find out at the last
minute that the promised flight is unavailable, the reality is that airborne
reactions on airlines are very rare in the spectrum of things and do not
expose a major risk to most patients.

Cruising for a reaction
The cruise is becoming a more and more popular vacation choice, but if
you’ve ever been on a cruise, you realize that the middle of the ocean is not
the best place to experience a severe food reaction. Like most vacation
options, however, cruises have their pros and cons:
 Cons: Most cruises have a doctor on board but the quality of the doctor,
and the depth of the doctor’s experience in treating food allergies,
cannot be guaranteed. Have a detailed emergency action plan in place,
as discussed in Chapter 7, and share it with the doctor and other per-
sonnel on board. Make sure they know where your emergency medica-
tions are stored and that they can get to them in a hurry. You should
also tweak your emergency plan, (see “Tweaking your emergency action
plan,” earlier in this chapter), to treat reactions more aggressively. Also,
make sure that you can contact your doctors, no matter where in the
middle of the ocean you are. Fortunately, the development of satellite
phones has made this much easier.
 Pros: Some cruises have a well-trained staff that’s very willing and able
to prepare special food just for you and is quite capable of responding
effectively in the event of an emergency. Eating on a cruise ship with
experienced chefs may certainly be much safer than dealing with a
dozen new restaurants in a less controlled environment.
I have a large number of patients who have had great luck with cruises. It
makes me a bit nervous, but if you do your homework and can identify a safe
cruise line, your trip may be as safe as it is enjoyable. Plan ahead and talk
with the right people. Ask other people you know with food allergy if they’ve
taken a cruise, and see what they recommend.

Witnessing the miracle of Disney: A case study
Many restaurants and vacation spots have
taken on food allergy as a serious issue and
have proven that they can make it work. I do not
want to lead anyone to believe that the Disney
resorts are the only place that have made this
work, but they do set the gold standard of how
to do food allergies right. 
Of all my patients and their families who’ve
stayed at a Disney Resort, I have never heard a
bad report, and most families are brought to
tears by the thought that their child can go out
to eat safely. The chefs go the extra mile and
offer tours of the kitchen and anything else you
need to make you comfortable, even if you
prefer to read every label on every box yourself.

Conquering the Challenges of
Daycare and Preschool
In This Chapter
 Deciding whether to send junior to daycare or preschool
 Selecting an allergy-friendly facility
 Joining forces with your child’s caregivers to maintain safety
 Implementing a speedy, effective emergency action plan
 Keeping snack time and parties fun and safe
You can establish a virtual blockade around your home to prevent
unfriendly foods from being smuggled across the border, but when you
ship your toddlers off to daycare or your little tikes off to preschool, they
enter a world where allergenic foods are often readily available, temptations
are strong, and ignorance is rampant. 
To safeguard your children when they leave your protective fortress, you
often need to re-create the safe environment of your home wherever you
choose to send your child — daycare, preschool, summer camp, or even at
the home of a relative or one of your child’s friends.
In this chapter, I provide the information and insight you need to make a well-
informed decision whether to send your preschool children outside the safe
haven of your home. I then provide guidance on how to work with your day-
care provider, preschool personnel, and other caregivers to create a safer
environment where your child can mingle with other children with less risk of
exposure to potentially dangerous food allergens.

Making the Big Decision: 
To Send or Not to Send 
Parents always face a few difficult decisions in which they seek to do what’s
best for their family and healthiest for their children. The decision of whether
to send a child to daycare or preschool, especially a child who requires spe-
cial care, can be even more taxing.
Some families have limited options. In single-parent homes or in homes
where both parents must work to make ends meet, the option of one parent
staying home is immediately off the table. Parents may consider asking a
family member to provide child care, but if family members don’t live nearby
or don’t exactly qualify for the job or want it, this option is off the table, as
well. With no suitable choices, the decision to send junior to daycare or
preschool has already been made.
In families that have multiple workable solutions, the decision-making process
may be a bit more thorny, especially if your child is severely allergic to multi-
ple foods. As with most decisions regarding food allergy, the bottom line is
whether the potential benefits justify the risk. 
Weighing the risks of daycare 
and preschool
You can significantly minimize the risks by following all the precautions I rec-
ommend in this chapter, but you can never completely eliminate the risk of
accidental exposure, even in your own home. To accurately weigh the risks of
sending your child to daycare or preschool, consider the following factors:
 Age: As children pass through their preschool years, they become more
and more capable of assisting with their own care and managing their
food allergy. Two-year-olds have virtually no self control or awareness of
their allergy or their surroundings and require much more vigilance from
the childcare providers. Three-year-olds typically have some under-
standing of their food allergy and may even have enough self-control to
resist the offer of some tempting food. By the age of four or five, children
with food allergy who are properly educated about avoidance at home
have considerable understanding of their food allergy and can truly play
some role in protecting themselves. 
 Place and providers: If you’ve been fortunate enough to locate a day-
care provider or preschool that seems to be very knowledgeable about
food allergy, this may make your decision easier. On the other hand, if
202
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

you’re not really comfortable with any of the preschools available, then
foregoing preschool or at least waiting another year may make more
sense. See “Finding the Right Daycare Center or Preschool,” later in this
chapter, for guidance on selecting a suitable childcare facility.
 Allergy types and severities: Finding a safe environment may be easier
if your child has a single peanut allergy than if your child has multiple,
severe food allergies. Although peanut allergy can certainly be deadly,
preschools are often much more aware of peanut allergy, and you may
even be able to find a peanut-free preschool. If your child is severely
allergic to milk, egg, or wheat, accidental exposures certainly pose a
greater risk, and you have almost no chance of finding a preschool that
completely eliminates these common foods. 
Considering the benefits 
of daycare or preschool
Daycare and preschool offer some valuable benefits in terms of social skills,
but very little academic benefit. Personally, I think the academic benefits are
minimal and blown way out of proportion. Daycare and preschool can, how-
ever, accelerate a child’s development of social skills and, in some cases,
lighten the load on the parents and enable them to pursue their own personal
and professional goals. This, in turn, may improve the overall emotional well
being of some families.
Only you can decide what’s best for your family, but don’t think you have to
send your children off to preschool out of fear that your they’ll fall behind in
school if you don’t. Preschool offers little to nothing in the way of academic
development that your child can’t get at home.
Social skills are important, however, so if you decide to keep your child home
during the preschool years, seek out other opportunities for your child to
interact with other children.
Finding the Right Daycare 
Center or Preschool 
Generally speaking, the younger the child, the more care the child requires.
By the time your child heads off to kindergarten, she can pretty much take
care of the basics on her own. At this stage, most schools are pretty well
equipped to deal with food allergies, especially now that food allergies are so
prevalent.
203
Chapter 12: Conquering the Challenges of Daycare and Preschool

Unfortunately, at the age when an allergic child requires the most care and
vigilance — during the daycare and preschool years — providers are often ill-
equipped to deal effectively with food allergies. Most daycare providers and
preschools don’t even have a food allergy policy or procedures in place to
guide them.
During these early years, toddlers and preschool age children are at particu-
larly high risk when it comes to food allergy because:
 They move fast. 
 They put almost anything in their mouths and share food without 
concern.
 They’re often messy eaters.
 Many can’t keep their hands to themselves. 
 Children under the age of three have little understanding of their food
allergy and may even be more tempted to share food because they’ve
been deprived of certain items at home. 
Three- and four-year-olds usually start to gain an understanding of their food
allergy and begin to protect themselves to some degree, but they still need
lots of supervision. These factors make it especially important that you
choose a daycare or preschool carefully and then work with the facility to
establish all necessary policies and procedures to keep your child safe. In the
following sections, I highlight the most important food allergy factors to con-
sider when selecting a preschool or daycare center for your child.
Shopping for allergen-free 
schools . . . or not
When shopping for a daycare center or preschool, should you insist on an
allergen-free environment? For children over the age of six, I’m generally not
a big proponent of prohibiting peanuts or other common allergenic foods.
When you’re in the market for a daycare center or preschool, however, par-
ticularly if your child has a peanut or tree nut allergy, an environment void of
all problem foods is, of course, ideal.
The question is, how accessible are allergen-free facilities? The answer
depends on which foods your child is allergic to. In the past, allergen-free
preschools and daycare centers were unheard of, but now I would estimate
that about half of all preschools are peanut-free zones. As for other allergenic
foods, including milk, egg, and wheat, you’re unlikely to find any school that
bans these foods or is even open to considering implementing restrictions.
204
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

When choosing a daycare center or preschool, all other factors being equal, 
a school that restricts or prohibits the food that your child is allergic to is a
better choice than one that allows it. However, finding such a facility can pre-
sent a huge challenge, particularly if your child is allergic to something other
than peanut.
Never get lulled into a false sense of security that allergen-free really means
allergen-free. Peanut-free, for example, merely means other children are less
likely to pack peanut butter sandwiches for lunch or snack on peanut butter
crackers. It means your child has much less of a chance of being accidentally
exposed to peanut, because a lot less of it will be spread around the class-
room and cafeteria. Peanut-free, however, does not mean that  all the other
parents read every label as carefully as you do and that everything other kids
bring in is completely peanut-free. 
Assessing a facility’s knowledge and 
experience with food allergies
As you go about investigating daycare centers and preschools, you may be
shocked at the differences you find from one place to another. The knowledge
and experience at childcare facilities generally falls into one of the following
three categories:
 Uninformed and inexperienced: The facility has had few or no children
with severe food allergy and has very little knowledge of food avoidance
and emergency treatment. An uninformed, inexperienced staff is not
reason alone to scratch the facility off your list. A facility that’s excellent
in other areas of childcare and willing to learn and implement effective
food allergy policies and procedures may still be an excellent choice.
205
Chapter 12: Conquering the Challenges of Daycare and Preschool
Are allergen-free facilities really best?
One of the major arguments against allergen-
free schools is that they may foster a false
sense of security. Teachers, parents, and chil-
dren sometimes get lulled into thinking that that
jotting down a few rules and regulations pro-
hibiting certain foods is 100 percent effective in
keeping them off the premises. In practice,
avoidance is rarely 100 percent effective, even
for those who are very careful.
The ideal environment for preschool age chil-
dren is one in which the most common and dan-
gerous allergenic foods are banned from the
premises, but teachers and caregivers remain
vigilant, carefully read food labels, monitor the
foods that children bring for lunch and snacks,
and carefully supervise all eating activities to
ensure a safe environment for everyone.

 Misinformed: The center has been thoroughly misinformed about food
allergy and has a policy in place that’s not even close to meeting your
child’s needs. A common example would be a policy and procedures
inspired by a family who says, “my child only has a mild peanut allergy,
so you don’t need to worry too much. It’s fine for him to eat cookies and
candies as long as peanut is not a main ingredient. And since he has only
broken out in hives before, my doctor says he does not need an epineph-
rine prescription.” This school may approach your child with the same
bias, which could create a very dangerous situation.
 Well-informed and sufficiently experienced: You luck out and find a
center that has been whipped into shape by other families who’ve
approached food allergy with the same vigor and vigilance as you. 
Inexperience with food allergy is much less common today than it was just
ten years ago. With the rising prevalence of food allergy, most centers that
care for young children have had to deal with food allergy and develop at
least a few standard procedures for dealing with it.
Even if the childcare facility you choose is well-informed and has had experi-
ence dealing with food allergies in the past, don’t assume that the staff knows
how to properly treat your child. In “Teaming Up with Your Child’s Daycare
Center or Preschool,” later in this chapter, I guide you through the process of
bringing the school up to speed on your child’s food allergy.
206
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 
Avoiding uncooperative facilities
If you have no option of whether to send your
child to daycare or preschool or you decide that
the social benefits outweigh any drawbacks, be
sure to choose a cooperative facility. The prob-
lem with daycare centers and preschools is that
no laws govern how they treat children with
food allergies. When your child is older, if you
choose to send him to public school, federal
laws mandate that the school provides a safe
environment for your child and address any
special dietary needs. 
Most daycare centers and preschools are not
bound by these regulations and have the ability
to say “No” if they don’t agree with your
requests or recommendations. The exceptions
to this are centers that receive federal funding,
such as Head Start programs, where they are
bound by laws similar to those in the public
school system. 
You may think that logic and compassion would
rule the day and that you can persuade the
facility’s administration to enact effective food
allergy policies and procedures, but some facil-
ities are simply unwilling to cooperate. 
Don’t choose a facility that strikes you as unco-
operative. You may end up fighting a battle for
“the principle of the thing,” in which your child
is almost certainly destined to become the loser.
Trust your instincts. Don’t even consider leaving
your child at a facility that seems unwilling to
provide a safe environment.

Gauging the size factor
The size of a childcare facility is less important than the ratio of children to
caregivers. For example, a preschool with a child-to-teacher ratio of 6-to-1 is
typically safer than a preschool with a ratio of 12-to-1, even if the preschool
with the 6-to-1 ratio is much larger overall.
During mealtimes, snack times, parties, and other activities when eating is
involved, an adequate number of caregivers is particularly important to
supervise the children and ensure that all food remnants have been cleaned
from the tables and from the children immediately before and after eating.
A cafeteria or other designated area for eating can help reduce exposure and
food contamination by keeping food out of the classrooms where children
spend the bulk of their time. Larger preschools and daycare centers are more
likely to have designated eating facilities.
Consulting the school nurse 
(or whoever’s in charge)
If you’re lucky, you may stumble upon a daycare center or preschool that has
its own nurse. This is only likely to happen in a larger facility, so if you opt for
something smaller, a nurse may not come with the package. The following
sections help you evaluate whether a nurse is a must-have at your facility as
well as how to best evaluate the nurse or person in charge at your facility.
Knowing whether you need a nurse
Is the absence of a nurse sufficient grounds for crossing a facility off your
list? Not really, as long as the facility has the following in place:
 A cooperative staff committed to maintaining a safe environment for all
children.
 Information and training required to limit your child’s exposure to aller-
genic foods. (You may need to become the trainer and resource person.)
 Instructions, training, and medicines to respond to allergic reactions
quickly and effectively. (Again, you may be the main source for instruc-
tions and training.)
 A competent surrogate for the nurse — typically the school 
administrator — responsible for implementing and maintaining all 
the policies and procedures needed to keep your child safe. 
207
Chapter 12: Conquering the Challenges of Daycare and Preschool

Evaluating the nurse or whoever’s in charge
When researching the best options for your child, speak to the nurse or who-
ever’s in charge of attending to health-related issues. This conversation can
give you a much better idea as to whether this facility is the right place for
your child. Engage the nurse or surrogate nurse in a discussion about your
child’s food allergy and try to get a sense of the following:
 Does this person really get it?
 Does this person understand food allergy and how dangerous it can be?
 How much experience does this person have caring for children with
severe food allergy? 
 Does the person fully grasp that even tiny food exposures can be deadly
and that they need to be prepared to treat allergic reactions immediately?
Once you’ve selected a daycare or preschool, engage in a more detailed dis-
cussion with the nurse or administrator. The section, “Teaming Up with Your
Child’s Daycare Center or Preschool,” guides you through the essential meet-
ings and training sessions and provides additional tips on how to team up
with your child’s daycare center or preschool for optimum safety. 
Teaming Up with Your Child’s 
Daycare Center or Preschool
After you select a daycare center or preschool for your child, your real work
as child advocate begins. Now, you must make sure that your child’s care-
givers are knowledgeable and skilled in caring for your child and that they
understand specifically which foods your child needs to avoid and what sort
of care to provide in the event of a reaction.
In the following sections, I provide guidance on how to educate your child’s
caregivers; select, train, and equip staff members to provide quick, effective
emergency care; assist the facility in developing clear, comprehensive proce-
dures for preventing accidental exposure to problem foods; and work with
the facility and other parents to establish it as a peanut-free zone.
Food allergy organizations have developed a variety of educational materials
specifically for schools and preschools. These can be very helpful, especially if
you’re dealing with a facility that has limited experience caring for allergic chil-
dren. The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis network has an excellent training pro-
gram complete with a video and written materials. Visit www.foodallergy.
org for details.
208
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Educating your child’s caregivers
Anyone you place in charge of caring for your child — daycare providers,
teachers, school nurses, camp counselors, even grandma and grandpa —
must be fully informed of your child’s food allergy. 
When sending your child off to preschool or daycare, provide a fact/instruc-
tion sheet with the following information, and make sure that everyone in the
setting who will have contact with and responsibility for your child reads and
understands the information:
 Your child’s name and photo: Caregivers must know your child’s name
and face.
 Type of food allergy: Everyone should know that your child has a food
allergy and be able to identify the foods and ingredients that your child
must avoid. The food allergy sheets in Chapter 6 can assist you in pro-
viding detailed information.
 The need for your seal of approval on any food items: Specify that only
the foods you approve are to be given to your child. In addition, encour-
age the school’s staff to carefully read food labels prior to giving your
child a particular food. They should know that manufacturers sometimes
change the ingredients they use, so they must read the label every time.
 The dangers of cross-contamination: Cafeteria workers need to be aware
of the potential dangers of cross-contamination, so they follow proper
food preparation techniques. All cooking utensils and surfaces must be
cleaned thoroughly before preparing and serving your child’s food.
Chapters 10 and 11 can help you lay out food preparation guidelines.
 The necessity for cleanliness: Cafeteria workers, dining room supervi-
sors, your child’s caregiver, and others must be aware that your child
needs to eat off of a clean table with clean utensils. In addition, students
should wash their hands with soap and water after eating. Refer to the
following section, “Establishing some basic lunchroom policies,” for
details on lunchroom policies.
Set up a face-to-face meeting with your school’s nurse, administrator, and all
other parties involved in your child’s care, distribute your fact/information
sheet at the meeting, and encourage staff members to ask questions. Follow
up with regular reminders over the course of the school year and any
updates from your child’s doctor.  
Figure 12-1 provides a form you can fill out and distribute to your child’s care-
givers. This form can assist caregivers in preventing your child from acciden-
tal exposure, but the form is no substitute for a treatment plan. See “Planning
for possible emergencies,” later in this chapter for details on preparing and
training for possible reactions. Chapter 7 includes a form you can fill out to
create a custom emergency treatment plan.

Establishing some basic 
lunchroom policies
The lunchroom, whether it’s a separate cafeteria, a designated eating area
outside the classroom, or the same room in which your child spends most of
his day, is the main battle ground for fighting accidental exposure to food
allergens.
Fortunately, a good dose of vigilance, proper cleaning procedures, some
common household cleaning agents, hand soap, and a little elbow grease can
help your child’s daycare center or preschool win the battle and provide
your child with a safer place to eat. The following sections describe three
simple policies and procedures for creating an allergy-friendly eating area.
Whenever requesting special arrangements for your child, attend to both
physical and emotional needs. Even very young children are sensitive to
being singled out, particularly if it isolates them from their classmates and
makes them a target for teasing. When asking for special treatment for your
child, make it clear that the accommodations are to be accommodating, cre-
ating a situation as close to “normal” as possible.
Scrubbing down the tables
After every meal or snack, a kitchen worker or staff member should thoroughly
clean the tables, especially if children are eating in the room in which they
spend most of their day. Following are some guidelines on proper cleaning:
 Use common household cleaning agents. As I explain in Chapter 3,
these cleaning agents have been proven effective in removing even the
most stubborn remnants of peanut butter and other allergens.
 Clean carefully and thoroughly. Rub hard, don’t simply swipe a rag
over the tables and chairs. Scrub any globs of food off the surface.
 In a cafeteria, before eating, wipe down the table where the child
with food allergies will sit. This is especially important if the child is
eating during a second or third lunch shift.
Washing hands . . . it’s not an option
I recommend that all children wash their hands before and after eating. The
pre-wash is primarily for sanitary purposes and to prevent your child from
ingesting any food allergens she may have picked up from toys or other
objects. The post-wash is more important for preventing allergic reactions —
to reduce the likelihood that another child who ate a food that would make
your child sick will spread it around the classroom or inadvertently rub it on
your child. Remember, kids at this age can’t keep their hands to themselves.
211
Chapter 12: Conquering the Challenges of Daycare and Preschool

Caregivers must supervise the hand-washing ritual and make sure that the
children wash their hands properly. Keep these tips in mind:
 A thorough scrubbing with a moistened wipe does the trick. A super-
ficial swipe with a wipe is inadequate.
 A good, thorough hand washing with soap and water followed by a
thorough drying of hands with paper towel also works.
 Antibacterial gels are not effective in removing food allergens.
If the childcare facility has one of those cloth towel rollers for drying hands,
it could pose a risk of accidental exposure. If your child dries her hands on
the same portion of a towel that another child wiped her hands on, any aller-
gens on that towel could wipe off onto your child’s hands. Paper towels or a
hot-air hand dryers are best.
Arranging for safer lunchroom seating
Distancing your child from other children who are eating the foods that can
trigger reactions is an important measure for preventing accidental exposure,
especially in daycare and preschool. The trick is to provide safe seating with-
out unnecessarily isolating your child. Here are three effective options:
 Designate a peanut-free table, as explained in Chapter 13. If your child
is allergic to peanut, chances are she won’t have to eat alone. In some
cases, the peanut-free table may be used for children with other food
allergies, as well, because these tables are typically cleaned more thor-
oughly and supervised more closely.
 Draw up a seating arrangement so children with the same food aller-
gies are less likely to be accidentally exposed to the problem foods.
 Arrange the seating to provide a little buffer around your child. Your
child may need to be seated next to children who are not eating a prob-
lem food or be seated between two empty places to create a buffer zone.
Caregivers should also enforce a no-food-sharing policy during all eating
activities. Preschool kids love to swap foods and try the exotic foods that
they’ve never seen in their own homes, particular when they’re young, but
food sharing is a big no-no, and anyone supervising eating activities must
strictly enforce the no-sharing policy.
Kids move fast and can shoot across a table or across a room faster than a
paper wad. The lunchroom may also have a fair share of sloppy eaters and
kids who talk with their mouths full. Close adult supervision is key to pre-
venting accidental exposure.
212
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Making your childcare facility peanut-free
Because peanut is notorious for triggering potentially severe reactions, many
daycare centers and preschools have formal peanut restrictions in place. If
your child is allergic to peanut, and the facility does not ban or restrict
peanuts, you can advocate for various restrictions:
 Formal peanut-free facility, in which the administration officially pro-
hibits children from bringing in anything with peanut as an ingredient.
 Voluntary peanut-free facility in which parents are encouraged to pack
peanut-free lunches and snacks for their children.
 Peanut-free tables, where your child can eat lunch and snacks. For more
about peanut-free tables, skip to Chapter 13.
A peanut-free school can be achieved several different ways. If the adminis-
tration agrees that peanut prohibition should be a universal policy, then they
mandate this policy and communicate it to all the parents. In some instances,
the school may be reluctant to enact a formal policy but will let it happen on
a more voluntary basis. The administration may be willing to provide you a
list of names and addresses of the other parents, so you can communicate
with them directly. 
Figure 12-2 shows a sample letter that I offer to parents who want to ask
other parents for their cooperation in keeping a facility peanut free. You may
need to modify the letter to better suit your needs, but the general tone of
the letter has proven very successful in persuading parents to cooperate in
creating a safer environment.
Planning for possible emergencies
One of the rules I stress throughout this book is that reactions happen, no
matter how many theoretically-effective avoidance maneuvers you have in
place. So even after taking all the steps to prevent reactions, you must pro-
vide the childcare facility with the training and medications it needs to treat
your child effectively in the event of a reaction.
Storing medicines in a safe, convenient location
Every daycare center and preschool has some sort of policy or procedures in
place for storing and administering medications. Find out where the medica-
tions are stored and who’s in charge of administering the medications to your
child. 
213
Chapter 12: Conquering the Challenges of Daycare and Preschool

Because allergic reactions can become very serious very quickly, medica-
tions must be readily accessible at all times. In some cases, childcare facili-
ties store all medications in a central area, such as the nurse’s station or the
administrator’s office. In other cases, your child’s teacher or primary care-
giver is entrusted with the medications. Which option is best? That depends
on several factors:
 How far away from the central location is your child during most of the
day, and especially during and after lunch, snack time, and parties? If
your child’s primary caregiver has to run through long halls or to
another building to get to the medicines, she may need her own supply.
 Is the central location accessible at all times? If the central location is off
limits or locked at certain times, then the facility may need to store a set
of spare medications in another room.
 Who’s responsible for giving the medication? If responsibility belongs to
both the nurse and the teacher or other caregiver, then the teacher or
Dear Fellow Parents:
As you may have heard, our child, Jane, has a severe allergy to peanuts. If she eats or 
even touches peanuts, peanut butter, or any food which may have been in contact with 
peanuts, she could develop a life threatening anaphylactic reaction. Because of this 
risk, we would be most grateful if you would refrain from sending peanut or nut snacks, 
or even any foods which are labeled as containing or possibly containing peanuts or 
other nuts, to school. In addition, please avoid sending in any home baked goods which 
may have come in contact with peanuts. Finally, if your child has eaten peanut products 
in the morning, please wash their hands and face so that they will be less likely to pass 
on traces of peanut when they come to school. Even a trace of peanut butter left on a 
toy might trigger an anaphylactic reaction.
We understand that these measures are burdensome and may be a tremendous 
imposition, particularly when so many children enjoy peanut butter. Unfortunately 
peanut allergies are becoming increasingly common these days, and although Jane is 
aware of her allergy, she is till too young to understand the consequences of eating 
peanuts and doesn't have the maturity to resist temptation. I think you would all agree 
that we must do whatever is necessary to keep our children safe, and by cooperating 
with these few requests, you will be contributing greatly to the welfare of our daughter. 
We thank you for your understanding and wish you and your children all the best during 
the school year.
I have also attached a list of safe snacks that may make your shopping a bit easier. If 
you have any questions, please feel free to call or email us at any time.
Sincerely,
Jane and John Doe

other caregiver should have ready access to their own set of medicines.
If, on the other hand, the teacher does not even know how to administer
the medications, having access to them makes little sense.
Clearly label and organize all medications and store your child’s emergency
action plan, as discussed in Chapter 7, with the medications to avoid any
confusion in the event of an emergency. I prefer that medications not be
under lock and key, simply because locks throw another obstacle in the way
of a speedy, effective response. If medications must be under lock and key,
make sure two or three people have a key immediately available at all times. 
Appointing and training emergency responders 
Almost every daycare center and preschool places someone in charge of
storing and dispensing medications — typically the school nurse or the facil-
ity’s administrator. To ensure that a competent individual is always on-call,
establish a failsafe system with fully-trained staff members in place:
 Appoint a minimum of two (preferably three) staff members to act as
emergency responders in the event of a reaction. Having only one fully
trained individual on call is an accident waiting to happen. A single sick
day or other staff member emergency would put your child at risk.
 Provide each designated emergency responder with a copy of your
child’s Food Allergy Emergency Action Plan, as discussed in Chapter 7,
and review the plan with your emergency responders in person. 
 Train each emergency responder to administer medications. They
need to know how to spot signs of a reaction, how to assess the severity
of a reaction, when to administer each medication, how much medicine
to give, and how to give it. If you’re sending in epinephrine autoinjec-
tors, all emergency responders should be trained on how to administer
the shots. Use a trainer device to demonstrate autoinjector use, and
then have the people in charge of giving the shots demonstrate its use
back to you to make sure they follow the proper technique.
 Let all your child’s caregivers know who the emergency responders
are and how to contact them. They should also need to know how to
spot the early warning signs of a reaction and be aware of the impor-
tance of quick, decisive action.
 Identify the nearest emergency medical facility, make sure their
EMT’s (Emergency Medical Technicians) carry epinephrine, and
supply a phone number to call immediately in the event of a severe
reaction. Onsite emergency treatment coupled with immediate profes-
sional medical care is required for severe reactions. Sometimes one or
two shots of epinephrine are not enough.
 Meet with the emergency responders before the school year and inter-
mittently during the school year. Provide detailed information and
instructions during the initial meeting. Subsequent meetings can be
informal and brief but are still important. 
215
Chapter 12: Conquering the Challenges of Daycare and Preschool

Consider staging a drill in which your child’s caregivers respond to a mock
emergency situation, so they know just what to do, whom to contact, where
the medications are stored, and how to administer them.
Chewing on Some Snack-Time Issues 
For better or worse, snack time is often the highlight of the day in preschool.
It boggles my mind why some people think that a child needs to eat every two
or three hours, but apparently the majority of parents and preschools think
that children will somehow pass out from hunger if they don’t have something
to eat every couple hours. Perhaps how snack time is handled should be one
of the main considerations in your daycare or preschool selection. 
In any event, the following list describes the most common snack-time 
scenarios:
 No snack time: Children simply don’t bring snacks, which cuts down on
opportunities for accidental exposure.
 Fruits or vegetables: Some “progressive” schools allow children to bring
only fruits or vegetables, or the school serves fruits or vegetables for
snacks.
216
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 
And the medications are where?
A mother recently called me for a new pre-
scription for her child’s epinephrine. According
to our records, she had already filled the pre-
scriptions we provided for the epinephrine
autoinjectors, so unless she already used those,
she should have had a sufficient number of
autoinjectors for both school and home.
The trouble was the school couldn’t find the two
autoinjectors she had brought in. When she vis-
ited the school at the end of the semester to
pick up her child’s medication, the staff mem-
bers in charge of storing and administering the
medications were unable to find the autoinjec-
tors. Needless to say, the mother was shocked
and dismayed to find out that her child had been
at risk in the preschool that she had come to
trust. 
The moral of this story is that follow-up meet-
ings with the people in charge of storing and
dispensing medications is essential. This unfor-
tunate situation could almost certainly have
been avoided with an occasional refresher
course and perhaps a mini-drill to make sure all
the pieces were in place for an effective emer-
gency response. 

 Parent-approved snacks: The school provides all snacks, but consults
parents for input. If you can get on the snack selection committee, work
with the school to choose snacks that are safe for your child. This could
even work if your child is allergic to something other than peanut, such
as milk, egg, or wheat. 
 Parent-provided snacks: Parents send in the snacks with or without
parental guidance. This isn’t always the best-case scenario for a child
with food allergies. Even if other parents know about the allergy, they
may not be as careful as you are about making sure the snacks they buy
or prepare are truly allergen-free. In this case, you may volunteer to be
the go-to parent for snacks or to work with a team of other parents in
the class to provide safe snacks.
 Counterproductive snack suggestions: Some facilities may actually rec-
ommend that parents send in snacks that contain the very allergenic
food your child is allergic to. The facility may, for example, insist that
peanut butter be a regular snack item. Here’s where you need to step in
and make your voice heard.
The key to safe snack- and meal time for your child lies in your ability to pro-
vide  all your child’s food or at least guarantee that the food being provided
by the school and other parents is safe. 
Keeping Parties Fun while 
Making Them Safe
Traditionally, parties provide an opportunity to let down your hair, break
rules and routines, indulge your desires, and throw caution to the wind.
Unfortunately, just about everything that many parents think makes a party
fun increases the risks for people who have a food allergy:
 Any activity that breaks the routine, including parties and field trips,
increases the likelihood of accidental food exposure.
 Party foods — cookies, candy, cake, and other finger foods — are
often too tempting for a child to resist.
 Well-meaning parents often send in risky foods that they fully believe
are safe. They often don’t realize that the innocent sugar cookies they
bought were contaminated by peanut at the bakery or that a benign
looking candy, such as jellybeans or candy corn, might actually contain
peanut or egg. 
217
Chapter 12: Conquering the Challenges of Daycare and Preschool

 Lots of party foods contain peanuts or tree nuts. This is especially true
around the holidays. We always see clusters of reactions around the
major holidays, especially Halloween and Christmas. 
So how can you keep parties safe? Follow three rules:
 No foods without the prior approval of the allergic child’s parents.
This is the granddaddy of all party rules.
 No exceptions to the first rule. No matter how safe or innocent the food
may appear, never break, bend, or otherwise misinterpret the meaning
or importance of rule number one. 
 Send in a safe party food. To make sure that your child is not pooped
out of the party, caregivers must inform parents in advance of an upcom-
ing party, so you can send in a safe party food — an allergen-free cookie,
cupcake, or other suitable alternative. 
If the school is planning a field trip or other outing off school grounds, work
with your child’s caregiver to ensure a safe trip and make sure the emergency
medications travel with your child. For additional tips on ensuring a safe field
trip, check out Chapter 13.
For the unplanned parties and activities, go with plan B. Ask the caregiver to
keep an approved party food on hand in the event of an unplanned party or 
if you forget to send something in. This could be a cupcake stored in the
freezer or box of favorite cookies with your child’s name on it stored in the
cupboard.

lmost all parents experience a little fear and trepidation, in addition to
some relief, when they send their children off to school. Your child may
become the victim of cruel bullies, be exposed to infectious diseases, get in
with the wrong crowd, or get hurt on the playground.
Parents of children who have severe food allergies have one more thing to
worry about — their allergic children experiencing a severe allergic reaction.
As I explain in this chapter, one option is to home school your allergic child,
but for many parents, home schooling is out of the question. For other par-
ents, home schooling just doesn’t fit into their plans for Junior; they want
their child to attend the local school system, so he can be “like other kids.”
What’s the alternative? To find a good school where the administrators,
teachers, and other staff are fully aware of the dangers surrounding food
allergies and then work with the school to make it even safer for your child.

In this chapter, I provide you with all the advice, tools, and tips you need to
create a safer educational environment for your child, from the time she
steps on the bus in the morning until the time she bursts through the back
door in the afternoon.
Selecting an Allergy-Safe 
Educational Environment
Parents want the best education for their children. What’s best, however,
varies greatly from one parent to another. Some parents simply don’t trust
the educational system to properly educate their children and keep them
safe, so they choose to home school. Some parents believe that private
schools offer superior educational opportunities. Others find that the com-
bined value of academics and social-skills learning provided by their local
public school systems are the perfect solution.
I can’t tell you what’s best for your children, whether or not they have food
allergies, but in the following sections, I lay out your options and provide
some guidelines, so you can make a well-educated decision in respect to your
allergic child’s safety. 
Public schools are required by law to make accommodations, even for the
most allergic child. If you have trouble convincing your school to cooperate,
which is hopefully not the case, refer to “Going Behind the Scenes with 504
Plans,” later in this chapter, to find out more about your rights.
220
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 
Calming your fears with the age factor
In Chapter 12, I discuss the pros and cons of
sending younger children to preschool, and I
point out that age plays a big factor in allergy
safety. Younger children are much more prone
to accidental exposure to food allergens. As
your child moves on from one grade to the next,
however, accidental exposure becomes less
and less of a risk for the following reasons.
 Many children outgrow their food allergies
when they reach school age, or at least the
allergies may be less severe.
 School age children have a greater aware-
ness of their food allergy and their 
surroundings, enabling them to play a more
proactive role in their own safety.
 Classmates are more mature — better able
to keep their hands to themselves and
follow proper etiquette in the lunchroom.
In addition, once your child is school-aged, if
you send your child to a public school, the law
is more clearly on your side — public schools
are required by law to provide a safe environ-
ment for your child.

Home schooling: The ultimate 
in allergy safety?
For parents who are already considering home schooling their children,
having a child with a severe food allergy may tip the scales in favor of home
schooling. The decision is perfectly understandable. The parents, leaning
toward home schooling their child anyway, factor in food allergy and choose
home schooling as the best option.
Few parents who have children with food allergy, however, decide to home
school based solely on the fact that the child has a food allergy, no matter
how severe it happens to be. Even in cases when the parents do base their
decision to home school solely on the food allergy, they often could have
made arrangements with the school to provide an acceptable level of safety.
Assessing public versus private schools
If you’re thinking about sending your child to a private school, you probably
already have a lot on your mind, including the big question — “Can we afford
it?” You’re probably weighing the costs and benefits right now and consider-
ing various factors, including academics, athletics, religious beliefs, family
tradition, and social benefits. When deciding whether to send a child with a
severe food allergy to a private or public school, other considerations may
influence your choice:
 Legally protected rights: Although most private schools are just as con-
cerned about the safety of their students as public schools, laws and
other regulations that govern medical conditions and disabilities, includ-
ing food allergy, do not apply to most private schools. Establishing the
right accommodations in a private school is a more voluntary process.
 Cooperation: Some private schools are unbelievably accommodating
when it comes to food allergy, while others are abysmal. By speaking to
other families and to school administrators, you can usually gauge the
school’s willingness to cooperate. Private schools typically fall into one
of the following three categories:
• Experienced and proven: The school has had many students with
food allergies and has established an excellent track record in
keeping them safe.
• Unproven but willing: The school has little experience dealing
with food allergy but is very willing to work with you to make their
school the best possible place for your child.
221
Chapter 13: Sending Food Allergies Off to School: K-12

• Inexperienced and unwilling: The school has little or no experi-
ence in dealing with food allergy and is unmotivated to change
course. Administrators may see it as too bothersome or too much
of a legal risk. 
 Size: School size matters, but not in the way that many parents may
think. Some parents think that smaller is better, especially if the school
has a higher student-to-teacher ratio, because the school provides more
supervision. A smaller school, however, is less likely to have a cafeteria,
meaning that students probably eat in the classrooms. While the cafete-
ria may sound like a nightmarish place for someone with food allergy, it
can actually be made quite safe, and I almost always prefer to get the
food out of the classrooms as much as possible. 
 Nurse availability: Having a nurse on staff is a big plus, but it shouldn’t
make or break your decision. Again, larger schools are more likely to
have a full-time nurse, but some small schools have a nurse, and some
large schools don’t. I’m used to working with schools without nurses, and
most schools can establish a safe environment even without a nurse.
 Location: Occasionally, the location of the school, especially the proxim-
ity to your home, is an important factor. Being closer to home can mean
shorter bus rides, or no bus ride at all, and a shorter distance for you to
travel in the event of a reaction.
In the final analysis, food allergy is not likely to be the deciding factor between
public and private schools but these are all important issues to consider.
Although public schools are required by law to accommodate special needs,
not all public schools are equally eager to conform to the legal requirements.
In other words, certain public schools can be as uncooperative as a private
school. With public schools, however, you have more legal leverage to force
them into providing the necessary accommodations.
Making a Safe School 
Safer for Your Child
Even if you pick the safest school in your neighborhood, accidental exposure
to a food allergen is always a possibility. To limit the risk of accidental expo-
sure, you can work with your school to implement some proactive preventive
measures.
222
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

In the following sections, I show you how to review and assist in modifying
your school’s food allergy policy, coordinate safety and emergency efforts
with the school’s nurse and other staff, and make school buses and lunch-
rooms safer.
Reviewing food allergy policies
No matter which school you choose, the school should have some sort of
food allergy policy in place. As I discuss in Chapter 12, many schools have
existing food allergy policies influenced or even established by parents of
allergic children who’ve attended the school. These policies often range from
dangerously deficient to very thorough and useful, so carefully review the
school’s existing food allergy policy in the light of the guidelines I lay out in
the following sections.
A school’s food allergy policy merely sets out procedural guidelines. A policy
is no replacement for specific information you provide to the school about
your child’s food allergy and detailed instructions on what to do in the event
of a reaction. Refer to Chapter 7 to create a food allergy emergency action
plan for your child, and keep it on file at the school. Chapter 12 includes a
useful form you can fill out to provide basic information about your child’s
food allergy to teachers, coaches, and other school staff who have regular
contact with your child.
General procedures
A school’s food allergy policy must include general procedures to ensure
medication is stored in a safe, convenient location and that staff members are
properly informed. Review your school’s food allergy policy to make sure it
answers to the following questions:
 Where are medications stored? The school should store the medications
in a convenient location accessible to all staff members at a moment’s
notice, and all staff members should be aware of the location.
 Where is each student’s emergency health care form filed? In the
event of an emergency, staff members should be able to pull up the form
for immediate reference. Consider storing the form with the school
nurse or administrator and having a copy available for your child’s
teachers. Storing a copy of the emergency form along with the medica-
tions is also a good practice.
 Who should know about the food allergy and how will they be trained?
All teachers, coaches, cafeteria workers, office personnel, playground
supervisors, bus drivers, and other staff members who have regular con-
tact with your child should be informed of what your child is allergic to,
223
Chapter 13: Sending Food Allergies Off to School: K-12

how to prevent accidental exposure to a food allergen, and what to do in
the event of an emergency. If your doctor prescribed epinephrine autoin-
jectors, two or more staff members should be properly trained on admin-
istering shots.
 Who will train substitute teachers (if applicable)? The food allergy
policy should specify how substitute teachers are to be trained when
your child’s teacher misses a day of school.
Food handling and eating
During the day, most students have some sort of break for lunch and perhaps
even a snack time. Every school’s food allergy policy must answer the follow-
ing questions:
 Where do students eat their lunch and snacks? A policy that keeps
food out of the classrooms is best, but if your school does not have a
central eating facility, this may not be an option.
 Who provides the snacks? School-only provided snacks are best. All
snacks must have clear, understandable labeling of all ingredients. If the
school has a policy in which students can bring their own snacks, then
you may need to deal with this issue with your child’s teacher. See
“Protecting Yourself without Becoming a Party Pooper,” later in this
chapter.
 Can the classroom be allergen free (for example, peanut free)?
Although your school’s food allergy policy may not ban a particular
food, it should include a statement that a particular classroom can be
made allergen free at the parent’s request.
 What are the specific cafeteria procedures?
• Peanut free tables and other seating arrangements should be
spelled out. See “Designating peanut-free tables and other seating
arrangements,” later in this chapter for details.
• If the school prepares and serves its own food, preparation and
serving procedures should be in place to clearly identify foods that
may contain ingredients that your child is allergic to and to pre-
vent cross-contamination. Chapter 10 details proper food prepara-
tion techniques.
• The policy should describe who’s in charge of cleaning the tables,
when tables need to be cleaned (before the first lunch room shift
and after each shift), how tables are to be cleaned (scrubbed thor-
oughly), and what cleaning solution to use.
 How and when are students to wash their hands? The school should
require that all students wash their hands before and after eating.
224
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Food allergy reaction emergency procedures
Prevention is not always 100 percent effective, so your school’s food allergy
policy must have a plan B in place that details the following:
 Where should the student go for help? If your child begins to experi-
ence a reaction, she needs to know ahead of time where to go for help —
the teacher, the main office, nurse’s office, or somewhere else. 
 Who should accompany the child? When experiencing a reaction, even
if it appears mild at first, your child should never be left alone. A teacher
or fellow student who knows what to do if the reaction intensifies should
accompany the child to seek help.
 Who is to stay with the other students? Most schools do not allow stu-
dents to remain unsupervised, so a plan should be in place for another
teacher or staff member to remain with the other students should the
teacher need to leave the room immediately.
 What should be done if the student is in the lunch room, classroom,
or gym? The food allergy policy must specify a separate plan for any
scenario in which your child may find himself in at school, including the
gym or lunch room. Who’s the go-to person in each scenario?
 Who’s responsible for calling the nurse? If your school has a nurse,
who’s in charge of contacting her — the teacher, administrator, or some-
one else? What does this person need to do to contact the nurse in an
emergency?
 If the nurse is not present, who’s next in line for action? A backup
emergency person should always be in place in case the nurse is out for
the day or cannot be contacted.
 When should the person in charge call 911? Instructions should 
spell out the conditions under which the person handling the situation
should call 911. Whenever epinephrine is administered, a call to 911 is
mandatory.
Schools have drills for fires, tornadoes, and even, unfortunately, school
ground intruders. Very few schools have drills for treating medical emergen-
cies. Consider staging a drill for a severe allergic reaction. A brief rehearsal or
two can ensure that everyone knows the role they play, that the medications
are accessible, and that the people administering the medications are able to
do it properly.
Field trips
A field trip transports your child out of the relative safety of the school
grounds and places him in a challenging, less-controlled environment. Your
school’s food allergy policy should address this challenge: 
225
Chapter 13: Sending Food Allergies Off to School: K-12

 Who’s responsible for carrying and administering the medications?
When your child is away from school, her regular emergency treatment
person may not be readily available. In such a case, who’s going to play
that role on the field trip? The teacher or the parent in charge of chaper-
oning your child’s group may need additional training.
 Are you able to attend? If you’re able to go on the field trip with your
child, this may be the best option. You can ensure proper prevention,
carry the medications yourself, and you know what to do in the event of
a reaction.
 What steps can be taken to minimize risks? As with other activities, the
key issues revolve around eating. Make sure you know what snacks or
meals may be needed and what food exposures may inadvertently occur
during a specific trip. Packing your child a lunch for the field trip may
reduce much of the risk.
For additional details on handling field trips, see “Taking Your Allergies on a
Field Trip,” later in this chapter.
After-school activities
After school, your child may be involved with extra-curricular activities, such
as the school newspaper, yearbook, sports, or student government. Another
teacher or a parent may be supervising this activity. Your school’s food
allergy policy should address how food allergies are handled during after-
school activities:
 Who’s in charge if a reaction occurs after school? The most important
step in ensuring safety after school is to inform the person in charge of
the after-school activity about your child’s food allergy and what to do
in case your child experiences a reaction. The food allergy policy should
specify that the coach or other activity supervisor is to be properly
trained. In addition, whoever may substitute for the coach or activity
supervisor also requires proper training.
 Where are medications stored? If medications are normally stored in
the nurse’s office, which may be locked after school, the policy must
specify a convenient, readily accessible location for the medications
after school, or the activities supervisor should be required to carry a
separate, fully stocked emergency kit.
 Who should the activity supervisor report a reaction to? When other
emergency personnel leave the school at the end of the day, who should
the activity supervisor contact in the event of a reaction? 
 What steps should be taken during a reaction? The policy should lay
out the specific steps the activity supervisor needs to take if your child
experiences a reaction. Use the emergency action form in Chapter 7 as
your guide.

Pow-wowing with the nurse, administrators,
and other staff
The best food allergy policy, if not properly implemented, is useless. As a
parent of a child with food allergy, your role is to ensure that everyone in 
the loop remains well-informed. In the following sections, I show you how to
meet with key school personnel and pass along the necessary information 
to them.
Preparing for your food allergy meeting
Before the school year is scheduled to kick off or preferably near the end of
the previous school year, prepare for a meeting with teachers, administrators,
and other school personnel. In preparation, gather the following materials:
 Food allergy policy: Make a copy of the school’s food allergy policy for
each person who’s planning to be at the meeting. Staff members may not
even be aware that the school has a food allergy policy. On your copy,
highlight and annotate the areas you want to focus on.
 School-required forms: Most schools have their own forms you must
complete and keep on file with the school. Obtain these forms early, so if
they require your doctor’s signature, you can have the forms completed
before your meeting.
 Your child’s food allergy sheet: Every staff member at the meeting
should know your child’s face, what she’s allergic to, and the basic rules
to follow to prevent exposure to the problem foods. See Chapter 12 for a
sample food allergy sheet. Complete it and make a copy for each person
planning to attend the meeting.
 Food allergy emergency action plan: Whoever’s in charge of adminis-
tering medications and treatment should have a food allergy emergency
action plan customized for your child. Chapter 7 provides the form you
need, unless your school requires that you file a different form.
 Medications: Have all the medications you plan on storing at the school
with you at the time of the meeting, especially if your doctor prescribed
epinephrine autoinjectors. Bring a copy of the instructions for the
autoinjector and one or two trainers to demonstrate their use.
 Food preparation and serving instructions: Cafeteria workers must get
up to speed on proper food preparation and serving procedures to pre-
vent accidental cross-contamination. See Chapter 10 for tips.

members, visit the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network Web site at www.

Scheduling your food allergy meeting
In the spring near the end of the school year is typically the best time to meet
with school administrators and staff. Gathering all required personnel during
the summer is nearly impossible. If you miss the spring and summer vaca-
tion, try to set up something just prior to your school’s opening day. Meet
with the principal or other school administrator and request a meeting with
all staff responsible for keeping your child safe:
 The school administer responsible for developing and implementing the
school’s food allergy policy.
 The school nurse or nurse’s aide and anyone else responsible for dis-
pensing medications and providing emergency treatment.
 Your child’s teacher(s).
 Food service personnel if the school prepares its own lunches. (If your
child is going to brown bag it, include food service personnel in the
meeting to discuss the need to thoroughly clean the table your child will
be sitting at. See “Packing for Lunchtime: Cafeteria or Brown Bag?” later
in this chapter for details.)
Delivering your food allergy presentation
With food allergy information and medications in hand, you’re well prepared
for your food allergy presentation. You can handle the meeting however you
think is best, but many parents have found the following agenda useful:
 Discuss food allergies in general.
 Discuss your child’s particular food allergy, highlighting preventive mea-
sures and what staff members can do to help ensure your child’s safety.
 Review your child’s food allergy emergency action plan, emphasizing the
role that each person plays in providing immediate, effective treatment. 
 Review the school’s food allergy policy, highlighting meal times, allergen-
free tables, hand washing, and how you expect snacks to be handled.
 Open the floor to questions and keep notes in case staff members request
additional information or instructions that you don’t have with you.
Feel free to make special requests of administrators or staff members for any
additional safety measures not already in place. In most cases, you can
simply negotiate a solution that works for everyone. In other cases, you may
need to supply a letter from your doctor or resort to more formal, legal
action, if the school is unwilling to cooperate, which is rare.
Don’t make your food allergy meeting a one-time event. Do an encore perfor-
mance at least once a year, even if all the personnel are the same as last year
and everything worked to perfection. Review policies and procedures; provide
updated forms, if needed; and check on the medications. When problems
228
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

arise, a follow-up meeting is a must, but even when everything is running
smoothly, schedule a meeting to provide reassurance, say thanks, answer any
questions, and, perhaps, even treat the staff to a batch of cookies — allergen-
free, of course — for a job well done.
Not all staff members may be willing or able to attend your presentation, so
be prepared to contact staff members individually to set up meetings. With
unwilling staff members, a non-confrontation approach is best. By explaining
the seriousness of your child’s food allergy and mentioning that the staff
member may need the information to keep your child safe and alive, you can
usually gain the person’s full cooperation. People are usually uncooperative
simply because they don’t fully understand how important this is. If the staff
member is still unwilling to cooperate, contact the principal — one of the
principal’s main jobs is to attend to parent concerns, and they’re usually well
aware of their legal obligations to do so.
Dealing with medications 
on school grounds
Every school stores and dispenses medications for students who require them
during the day. In most cases, the school requires that you send medications
in their original package, clearly labeled, and often with your doctor’s instruc-
tions or a permission slip signed by the doctor.
With most medications, a missed dose doesn’t pose any risk to the student’s
life. In the case of food allergies, however, if sufficient quantities of the med-
ication are not readily accessible, and the staff member in charge of adminis-
tering the medication is unavailable, the situation can pose a significant risk
to your child.
In the following sections, I recommend procedures to minimize the risks.
Ensuring the medications are accessible
Prior to the beginning of the school year and a couple times during the year,
check to make sure that your child’s medication supplies are fresh and fully
stocked. If the school keeps medications under lock and key, which I recom-
mend against doing, find out who has the key, and make sure your child’s
teacher knows who’s holding the key. 
Don’t just call into the school. Ask to see where the medications are stored. By
asking to see the medications yourself, you can get a pretty good idea of how
accessible they are. If the office has to hunt around for the key to the medicine
cabinet for ten minutes, you’ve just observed a problem that the school needs
to address. In addition, you may discover that the school has misplaced your
child’s medications. Inspect in person with your own two eyes.
229
Chapter 13: Sending Food Allergies Off to School: K-12

Naming the keepers of the medications
Storing your child’s medications in an easily accessible, central location may
be adequate, but if your child is stuck out in a satellite classroom at some
point during the day, then you may need to supply a second or even a third
set of medications to provide easy access at any point during the day.
In some cases, having your child carry his own medicines may be best, but
it’s not always the optimum solution. See “Working toward independence:
Carrying your medications,” later in this chapter for details.
Establishing a strategy for dispensing medications
Work with your doctor to fine-tune the Food Allergy Emergency Plan provided
in Chapter 7 or to complete whatever emergency treatment form your child’s
school requires. Some forms are better than others, and some doctors take
more care than others to complete these forms.
If the school’s generic forms are inadequate or your doctor provides only
sketchy instructions, don’t be shy to ask for something more detailed.
Working toward independence: Carrying your medications
Some schools allow older students to carry their own medications, as long as
the school has this in writing signed by your doctor. In fact, many states have
laws that give students the right to carry their own medications, assuming
the situation requires it.
Carrying medicines obviously has the advantage of guaranteeing that the
medicines are immediately available. This approach, however, is not ideal in
all situations. Consider the following:
 Can you trust your child? Some kids lose everything and others can’t
resist the temptation to show other kids what they have in their bag. I’ve
seen several inadvertent injections of epinephrine with this sort of show
and tell.
 Can your child administer her own medications? Pre-teens may not be
able to give themselves their own medication, particularly an epineph-
rine autoinjection. In such cases, the medicine does no good unless a
responsible adult is immediately available.
 Is your child willing to carry the extra baggage? Toting around fanny
pack or some other bag with medications may cramp your child’s style.
As long as the medicine is readily available in a matter of minutes, which
usually is the case at most schools, then burdening your child with this
responsibility may not make sense.

Riding the school bus with food allergies
The school bus has become an icon of Americana — a relatively safe mode of
transportation that carts the kiddies off to school every morning and drops
them back at home in the early evening. For students with food allergies,
however, even a relatively safe bus ride can be a source of anxiety. 
If your child is a responsible teenager and the school allows its students to
carry medications, your child can carry his own medications and take most
of the worry off your plate. If not, then you may face a tricky predicament due
to the following complications:
 Few school systems require their bus drivers to carry or be responsible
for administering medications.
 If the bus driver agrees to take care of the medications, you still have the
hassle of handing the driver the medications in the morning and having
the driver pass the medications to the school, pick them up after school,
and return them to you.
 Storing epinephrine on the bus is not a good idea, because it would be
exposed to hot or cold weather.
 A substitute bus driver may show up who’s heard nothing about the
food allergy or the medicine.
That being said, here are your options:
 Drive your child to school yourself to avoid the whole situation.
 Pick up and move to one of those rare school systems that have trained
all their bus drivers to treat an allergic reaction.
 Lobby your school system to train their bus drivers and organize a
system to store and transfer medicines.
 Make the bus safer by putting the following precautions in place:
• Be certain your child knows about her allergy and can be trusted
to never, ever share food with other children.
• Inform the bus driver of your child’s allergies.
• Have your child routinely sit in the front seat where the bus driver
can keep a better eye on her.
• Make sure the bus driver has cell phone access at all times to call
for help if needed.
Even if you have no other option than to send your child on a bus without
medications and without a bus driver who’s fully equipped to deal with a
severe reaction, I believe it is an acceptable risk, especially if the bus ride is
relatively short. Over time this situation will hopefully improve in more and
more school systems.

Designating peanut-free tables and other
seating arrangements
Peanut-free tables are now an option at many schools, and most schools are
willing to provide one if requested. Should your child’s school have designated
peanut-free tables or special allergen-free seating arrangements? This is for you,
your child, and the school to decide, based on the following considerations:
 Do peanut-free tables help? Yes, especially for children younger than
nine years old. By the time a child is nine or ten years old, I believe that
these allergen-free tables no longer provide much benefit.
 What does your child want? Peanut-free tables and other seating
arrangements may add to the stigma of having a food allergy. Ten years
ago, I wrote letters requesting that schools provide peanut-free tables.
Now I write a lot more letters to liberate kids from their peanut-free iso-
lation wards.
 Does the school mandate peanut-free tables for students with food
allergies? To protect the school from lawsuits and ensure safety, some
schools require students with food allergies to sit at peanut-free tables.
In other schools, the choice is up to the student and parents.
The specific arrangements for peanut-free tables vary widely from school to
school. The more isolating the arrangement, the more distasteful it is for the
child. In fact, this is the main reason that families ask to remove their child
from peanut-free purgatory. Following are a couple examples of allergen-free
table arrangements that schools have implemented:
 Students are allowed to invite one or more friends to sit with them as
long as they eat a peanut-free lunch. This makes the situation much
more tolerable.
 All students with any sort of food allergy sit at the same table — typi-
cally a table that’s more frequently and thoroughly cleaned and better
supervised. This provides students with a greater likelihood of sitting at
a table with a classmate.
 Only students with peanut allergy sit at the table. This may be fine, but
more often it results in some fourth or fifth grader getting stuck at a
table with a first or second grader. This sure takes the fun out of lunch,
and remember, for young kids, the favorite part of their day may just be
lunch or recess.
Dealing with non-peanut allergens at lunch time
Peanut allergy is definitely the scariest allergy in the cafeteria, due to
peanut’s notorious reputation for triggering life-threatening reactions, but if
your child is allergic to milk, egg, or some other food, you’re no less con-
cerned about protecting her safety.
232
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Although some schools are willing to arrange for a milk-, egg-, or wheat-free
table, such arrangements are more difficult to implement and increase the
odds that your child will be sitting at a cozy table for one. The solution? The
peanut-free table may still be the best option, simply because it’s typically
cleaned more thoroughly and is better supervised.
In the most extreme situations, you may be able to get an aide to supervise
your child’s lunch. This would usually occur only with a 504 plan, as dis-
cussed in the section later in this chapter, “Going Behind the Scenes with 
504 Plans.”
Being careful what you ask for
Public schools are required by law to provide a safe environment for your
child, so administrators may overreact to your requests out of fear. If you
request special accommodations, without specifying exactly what you want,
you may be unpleasantly surprised at what you get. 
If, for example, you request that your child not be exposed to a particular aller-
gen in the cafeteria, the school may decide that your child needs to eat in the
nurse’s office or library. Your child may find that a quiet lunch in solitude is
perfectly acceptable, or he may look at it as punishment for having an allergy.
Unless you’re careful about what you ask for, you may find that you’ve backed
yourself into a corner you can’t get out of. Be careful what you ask for.
Taking a few sensible precautions
For most children, a few simple precautions are sufficient for ensuring safety
in the lunchroom. Consider the following precautions, and remain flexible, so
you can modify the precautions based on the school’s facilities, your child’s
age, and the nature of the food allergy:
 Make sure your child has a clean place to sit. This is especially a con-
cern if your child is scheduled to eat during a later lunch shift. Your
child should have a designated safe seat, where she sits every time she
eats lunch. A properly trained adult should be in charge of cleaning the
seat and table before your child’s lunch shift. Having a fellow student
clean the table is usually inadequate.
 Create a buffer around your child. Seating your child at the end of the
table next to a classmate who’s eating only safe foods is typically the
best option.
 Have your child pack a placemat. Eating off of a placemat or plate can
prevent your child’s food from picking up any allergenic remnants off the
table.
By high school, your child can safely leave most of these precautions back in
junior high. Your child should still avoid sitting at a dirty table with messy
eaters, but special seating arrangements generally are unnecessary. 
233
Chapter 13: Sending Food Allergies Off to School: K-12

Packing for Lunchtime: Cafeteria 
or Brown Bag?
Eating the cafeteria food may be a risky proposition, even for students with-
out food allergies, but most students enjoying buying lunch at least some of
the time, so the option is worth investigating. 
When deciding whether to allow your child to buy school lunch, consider
your child’s food allergy, the knowledge and experience of the food service
staff, and the menu selections:
 If your child has an isolated allergy, such as peanut, and the school and
food service staff are well indoctrinated in reading labels and following
precautions to avoid cross-contamination, your child may be able to eat
a variety of foods on the menu. 
 If, on the other hand, your child is allergic to milk, egg, wheat, or other
allergens commonly used as ingredients in many foods, then cross 
contamination may be too risky, particularly if the food service staff is
inexperienced.
 If the menu is loaded with items that contain the allergen that your child
is allergic to, brown bagging it may be the best option. Even with a well-
trained and very careful food service staff, the risk may not be worth it.
If you decide to let your child buy lunch, even part of the time, have a
detailed meeting with the food service staff, from the top down, to review
ingredients, policies, and procedures. This is necessary, even if the food ser-
vice staff has had experience with preparing foods for students with food
allergies.
234
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 
The ultimate peanut-free zone . . . a horror story
I thought that I had seen the most draconian
peanut-free zone policies possible, until one of
my patients described how her school had
demarcated its peanut-free zone. 
My patient, a fifth grader at the time, was
returning to school to begin a new year and was
invited to take a tour of the new peanut-free
arrangements. The school had placed its
peanut-free table in an alcove that was sepa-
rated from the other children. They painted
large arrows on the floor that she was prohib-
ited from crossing as she made her way to the
table. She was further dismayed to find that the
table was labeled with a large red sign banning
any other children from crossing another series
of lines that quarantined the table. 
Her parents, who had been among those who
pushed the school to create a peanut-free table
when she was in first grade, were now asking
me for a letter to permit her to sit elsewhere.

After you’ve done your homework, if you still feel uncomfortable with the
idea of your child eating the school lunch, then brown bagging may the best
solution. In addition to preventing reactions, the food is likely to be much
better.
Protecting Yourself without 
Becoming a Party Pooper
Although most people view lunchtime as the most menacing threat to chil-
dren with food allergies, the risk of accidental exposure looms larger in the
perilous party scene and at snack time. In fact, any eating activity that dis-
rupts the normal routine is far more risky than the relatively well-controlled
environment of the lunchroom.
Without becoming the school’s party pooper mascot, your child can keep
parties and snack times safe by following a few simple precautions:
 No sharing food. Instruct your child never to share, trade, or accept
food from others, even if it looks safe or the giver swears that the food 
is completely allergen free. Follow one rule about sharing food — never
do it!
 Bring a safe party food alternative from home. For scheduled parties,
send in a safe party food for your child, volunteer to cater the party
yourself, or have your child’s teacher keep a store of safe party foods
available for surprise parties.
 Host the party in the cafeteria. If possible, keep party foods out of the
classroom, so students can return to an allergen-free classroom after 
the party.
Parties often pose the most serious risks for three reasons: they break rou-
tine, often include problem foods (such as desserts with peanut, egg, milk,
and wheat), and involve eating foods in the classroom, increasing the risk of
exposure.
Taking Your Allergies on a Field Trip
Like parties, field trips disrupt the normal routine. One day your child is sit-
ting in the classroom, and the next, he’s off to the dairy farm to learn the fine
art of homogenizing milk.
235
Chapter 13: Sending Food Allergies Off to School: K-12

When you hear about a planned field trip, your ears should perk up, and you
need to ask a few questions to find out where the class is going, what they’re
planning to do, where they’re planning to eat, and who’s responsible for
making sure the medications get on the bus and providing emergency med-
ical treatment. Consider the following issues at least a few days before the
planned departure date:
 Is the class going somewhere that could be hazardous? A milk allergic
child may be better off skipping the field trip to the local dairy farm, and
a student with wheat allergy may want to forego the bakery tour. With
sufficient early warning, the teacher may be willing to work with you to
choose a safer destination, but if the itinerary is already set, your child
may have to remain behind.
 Who’s in charge of your child? In most cases, the teacher takes a group
of children, and other groups are assigned to parent chaperones. At this
point, the teacher should be well informed of your child’s allergy, so
having your child in the teacher’s group may be best. If that’s not possi-
ble, volunteer to chaperone or at least talk to the parent who’s going to
be assigned to your child’s group.
 Who’s responsible for packing, carrying, and administering the medi-
cines? The medicines need to be available at all times, not left sitting on
the bus.
 Is a cell phone going to be available at all times, if anything comes up?
 Can you go on the trip? In some schools, parents are diplomatically un-
invited. Others prefer you to go. Offloading the responsibility onto you
sure makes the teacher’s life easier.
Going Behind the Scenes with 504 Plans
Most schools do everything possible to provide students with a safe educa-
tional environment and are willing to implement necessary policies and pro-
cedures to accommodate students with even the most severe food allergies.
If your school’s policies and procedures are inadequate and its administra-
tors or staff members are unwilling to provide accommodations that you and
your doctor think are necessary, you have legal recourse.
Three key laws protect the rights of disabled individuals in schools and other
institutions that receive federal funding. I describe these laws and show how
they apply to food allergies in the following sections. Unfortunately, some
schools don’t know the laws or mistakenly believe that they only protect the
rights of students who are physically or mentally handicapped or require
educational modifications.
236
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Section 504
Section 504 is a civil rights law with a twofold purpose: “ . . . to prohibit dis-
crimination on the basis of disability in education or employment in any pro-
gram or institution receiving federal funds, and to ensure that students with
handicaps or disabilities receive a free and appropriate public education.”
Public schools and private preschools and daycare centers that receive fed-
eral funds must comply with this law and its regulations to qualify for finan-
cial assistance. 
Sometimes, students with less obvious disabilities, such as life-threatening
food allergies, are not considered “disabled.” However, students have been
able to have their health- and learning-related concerns successfully
addressed at school under Section 504. Under Section 504, a school district
must consider the individual needs of a child and provide related services or
necessary program modifications to enable that child to attend school. The
school must provide these modifications at no cost to the parents. 
The law provides that students with disabilities must be educated with non-
disabled students, and students with disabilities must receive the same or
equal access to educational opportunities or extracurricular activities that
are provided to students without disabilities. Students cannot be excluded
from going on field trips, eating in the cafeteria, or participating in class pro-
jects because of their food allergies. 
Schools must comply with Section 504 as a prerequisite for receiving federal
funds. Failure to provide an appropriate public education is a violation of a
student’s civil rights and can jeopardize the school’s federal funding. If you’ve
done everything you can and the school remains unresponsive to your
requests, call the United States Health and Human Services Department at
1-800-368-1019, e-mail ocrmail@hhs.gov, or visit www.hhs.gov/ocr to file
a complaint online.
For more information about 504 plans, including a Question and Answer sec-
tion and links to additional useful Web sites, visit the Council for Educators
for Students with Disabilities, Inc. Web site at www.504idea.org.
The Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA)
IDEA requires schools to evaluate any student suspected of having special
needs and to provide for that student’s educational needs in the least restrictive
237
Chapter 13: Sending Food Allergies Off to School: K-12

environment, as appropriate for the individual child. IDEA specifies that parents
of children with disabilities and school personnel are equal partners in the plan-
ning process that creates the goals, program and environmental modifications,
and services that are written into the Individualized Education Plan (IEP). An
IEP or other written plan is not required by Section 504, but IDEA reinforces
your child’s rights to a fair education.
The Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA)
The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), further extends the rights and
responsibilities provided under Section 504. ADA states “no individual shall
be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoy-
ment of the goods and services . . . of any . . . public accommodation.” 
The ADA states that public accommodations, including any school receiving
federal funding, must take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no
individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated, or other-
wise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of aux-
iliary aids and services. Noncompliance with the ADA can result in civil and
criminal penalties or even loss of federal assistance. 
Citing the law to gain cooperation 
When a school seems reticent to ensure the safety and full participation of
your child in their curriculum, you may have no choice but to cite the laws
that ensure your child’s rights. Bottom line, the law requires the school to:
 Not deny a child admission based on the child’s disability.
 Recognize children with life-threatening food allergies as disabled and
protected under federal law. 
 Work with parents to enable students to safely participate in all activi-
ties with their peers. 
 Provide services and program modifications under section 504 for dis-
abled students, even if they’re not eligible for special education.
 Provide necessary accommodations, so no student is excluded from
field trips, eating in the cafeteria, or class projects because of their food
allergies. 
238
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

 Provide an appropriate public education to eligible students. 
 Provide benefits and services detailed under Section 504, regardless of
whether the student is considered a special student under IDEA.
 Have an appeals procedure in place (required both by IDEA and Section
504) to field complaints from any parent who feels that their child is not
receiving the benefits and services they need.

In This Chapter 
 Knowing what it’s like to be a teenager with food allergy
 Gearing up your teen to take on more responsibility
 Building a support group to shore up your efforts
 Taking on acceptable risks
 Dating safely . . . and enjoyably
B
eing a teenager is tough, even if you don’t have food allergies. You’re
trying to figure out how to navigate a world that doesn’t really under-
stand you and perhaps doesn’t really want to listen. You’re young. You’re nat-
urally driven to break away from your parents and other authority figures.
You have less to lose. You’re invincible, unbreakable, shatterproof! So, what’s
up with all the worry, the rules, the restrictions? 
As a parent of a teenager, you’re probably fighting conflicting emotions and
thoughts. You want to loosen the reins to give your child more freedom and
responsibility. At the same time, you want to rein in your teen, set some
healthy limitations, and provide guidance on how to make good decisions.
When you add food allergy to the mix, the situation can become even more
tense and unstable. Out of fear for the health and safety of your teenager, you
may try to impose additional limitations. Your teenager, already saddled with
more limitations than he can bear, may tend to react against the additional
restrictions — restrictions that many of his friends don’t have. Couple that
with normal peer pressure, and your teenager (quite understandably) may
place himself in high-risk situations, sometimes just to prove to himself that
he can.

This chapter explores the challenges of being a teenager with food allergies
and being a parent of a teenager with food allergies and explains some ways
parents and their teenage “children” can work together to cope with the reali-
ties of the situation. 
Fostering an Atmosphere of Empathy
Families often become embroiled in battles due to differences in perspective.
The parents’ job is to protect their children. The child’s job is to become
independent. These two goals are often diametrically opposed, even when it
comes to dealing with health issues.
The key to successfully resolving any conflict and effectively teaming up to
properly manage a food allergy is empathy. Establish common ground. Work
toward understanding one another’s concerns, fears, and needs. Respect the
challenges that each of you face. Only then can you begin to collaborate and
see food allergy for what it really is — an inconvenient and sometimes dan-
gerous reality that needs to be supervised and managed.
Whether a teenager has a newly acquired food allergy or an allergy that
developed in early childhood, the food allergy is a huge burden — physically,
socially, and psychologically. Studies show that food allergy has a marked
effect on quality of life, and this typically peaks in adolescence when the
effects of being different are always magnified.
Acknowledging the injustice
No doubt about it, food allergy sucks. As a parent, you may be tempted to
soothe your teenager’s angst concerning food allergy by pointing out every-
thing in life that could be deemed as being worse — diabetes, AIDS, blind-
ness, hearing loss, acne, and any other health issue you can think of, but the
fact is that your teenager is dealing with food allergy, and for him or her, it
sucks. It also sucks for you, as a parent.
I hate to sound like some family therapist on TV, but the fact is that only 
by admitting how you truly feel about food allergy can you validate one
another’s feelings and then work through them to a more logical resolution. 
242
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Feeling the sting of teenage teasing
In the perfect world, the most effective way to prevent accidental exposure
would be to inform everyone that you have a food allergy, so they wouldn’t
accidentally expose you to the food that makes you ill. In junior high and even
in high school, telling everyone that you have a food allergy can be like hang-
ing a sign on your back that says “Kick me!” Any exposed weakness is a vul-
nerability that the school bully may quickly pick up on and begin to exploit.
Teasing can range from minor verbal harassment to really dangerous stuff. I
have seen hundreds of incidents in which “harmless” teasing escalated into
intentional food exposure or at least an attempt to knowingly expose some-
one with food allergy to an allergenic food. I’ve seen peanuts thrown at kids
and milk blown through a straw across the lunch table at school into the face
of an allergic teen. 
Nip it in the bud. Work to make your school a tease-free zone. “Harmless”
teasing can quickly escalate into ugly scenes, and the more dangerous this
becomes, the more aggressively your school needs to deal with it. Knowingly
exposing someone who has a severe food allergy to an allergen is the equiva-
lent of assault with a deadly weapon.
Some strategies that I teach my patients, and occasionally have to use myself,
are listed here. (Note that I use the phrase “have to” rather than “had to.”
Even at this point in my life the teasing hasn’t stopped. Not that long ago a
well-educated colleague jokingly offered me a doughnut saying, “Would you
like some peanuts?”) Here are some strategies to deal with insensitive idiots:
 Just ignore them. Most teasers tease to get a rise out of you — that’s
their reward for success. When the teasing starts, just ignore them. It
may not be easy but this is usually the best approach. 
 Tell them how you feel and ask them to stop. This can be effective,
especially if the teaser is generally a friend or at least a decent person.
For others, however, this may be just the kind of reaction they were
hoping for and may only make things worse. 
 Tell an adult. This is essential if the teasing is affecting your life and
whenever it crosses the line to the point to being dangerous. A responsi-
ble adult needs to know about this.
I always remind my patients that everyone gets teased at some point, whether
they have food allergies or not. If it is potentially harmful, it must be taken
seriously and reported to an adult. Appropriately, some schools have taken a
very tough stand against teasing. Otherwise, shake it off — don’t let it get to
you. If the teasing really bothers you, bring the behavior to the attention of a
parent, teacher, guidance counselor, or other trusted adult. 
243
Chapter 14: Empowering Your Adolescent or Teenager

Dealing with restrictions and limitations
No matter how lenient you are as a parent, you’re always too strict for a
teenager. No matter how responsible of a teenager you are, your parents are
always going to worry about you. When decisions and disagreements over
food allergy are complex only one thing is certain — the parent is likely to be
overly protective, and the teenager is likely to take too much of a risk. 
I’m not about to tell parents how to raise their teenage children. And I cer-
tainly wouldn’t try to tell a teenager how to raise her parents. All families are
different, everyone’s allergies are unique, and every family has the right to
approach the same situation in its own way. I offer no one-size-fits-all approach.
I know teens with the same food allergy who have never been permitted 
to ride the school bus, while others have traveled on their own to foreign
countries.
If you and your teenager lock horns on a particular issue, consider taking the
matter to your doctor for discussion. Your doctor is unlikely to make the
decision for you, but he may be able to defuse the emotional dynamite, high-
light the facts, and explain the potential risks and rewards, so you can arrive
at a more reasonable consensus. Some parents are far too restrictive, and
teens are far too prone to taking risks. The trick is to find a happy medium.
Sizing up the situation: Newly developed
or long-standing allergy?
The way you approach food allergy may depend on whether the food allergy
is something totally new or has been a family issue for some time. For newly
developed allergies, the special issues may include
 The need to learn about food allergies from scratch, at a time in life
when medical concerns are hardly a favorite topic.
 Potentially intense frustration and anger generated by the eternal ques-
tion, “Why me?”
 A positive realization that this is a serious problem that needs to be
dealt with. If the reaction was relatively recent, it could lead to less risk
taking and a determination to learn about and take control of the food
allergy . . . at least as long as the reaction is still fresh in mind.
With long-standing food allergies, other issues are more likely to bubble to
the surface during the teenage years:
244
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

 Some teenagers accept their food allergy as a part of their lives. They
take the necessary precautions to avoid the problem foods, and they
remain prepared for emergencies.
 Some teenagers may become too complacent, especially if they haven’t
had a reaction in some time. They may doubt whether the allergy is real
or still present, which may lead to more risk taking.
 Unexpressed frustration and smoldering anger may find expression in
unpredictable ways. The teenager may not even realize that the root
cause of some unacceptable behaviors lies with resentment over having
a food allergy.
 Long-term parent-child issues may arise if parents have been overpro-
tective and the teen suddenly finds himself in a situation in which he’s
expected to take on more responsibility.
Empowering Your Teen to Take 
on More Responsibility
The teenage years are a transitional period — a bridge from childhood to
adulthood. As such, teenagers often demand more freedom, while parents
encourage them to take on more responsibility in just about every aspect of
their lives — homework, jobs, driving, dating, and health. With food allergy,
the challenges are amplified but should certainly be manageable. Here are
some suggestions that may help you weather the storm:
 Avoid the blame game. Both parties are attempting to achieve the same
goal — successful management of the food allergy. As long as you keep
this in mind, you may be able to avoid the blame game.
 Transfer ownership of the allergy. This can be tough, especially for par-
ents who’ve been managing their child’s allergy for several years. At
some point, parents need to transfer ownership of the allergy, and the
teenager must accept more of the burden. Agreeing to a slow, gradual
transition may work. As parents see that the teen is able to handle small
responsibilities, they will be more comfortable letting the teen handle
the big ones.
 Ask the doctor. Teenagers can play a more active role during office
visits by asking questions about medications, treatment options,
whether certain situations are safe, and so on. 
 Transfer responsibility when dining out. Most teenagers are perfectly
capable of communicating with a restaurant server or cook. The next
245
Chapter 14: Empowering Your Adolescent or Teenager

time you dine out, encourage your teen to ask the questions about ingre-
dients and food preparation, or, if you’re the teenager, ask your parents
to let you do the talking.
 Hand over control of the medications. The key to success is the ability of
the person who has the allergy to responsibly manage her own medica-
tions. Teens need to prove that they will always have their medicines with
them when they leave the house. I give parents permission to nag their
teens until the teens show that they’ve fully assumed the responsibility.
 Discuss common scenarios. Talk about the best way to handle specific
events, such as a school dance, summer camp, hanging out at the mall,
or going to parties. By drawing up a game plan well in advance, you may
be able to avoid some risky surprises and create an experience that’s
less stressful and more enjoyable.
 Rehearse difficult situations. Knowing how to react in a specific situation
before that situation arises is often critical in helping a teen make the right
decisions and take the right actions. Role-play different scenarios — for
example, say you’re at a party with friends and someone offers you a
cookie, what do you do? If you have a severe reaction, what would you
do? If the teen might need epinephrine, have them use an expired autoin-
jector on an orange or grapefruit to demonstrate its use.
 Analyze past mistakes. Teens should open up to their parents about 
situations they’ve encountered and mistakes they’ve made without the
threat of punishment hanging over them. Parents can then suggest a
potentially more effective course of action for the next time a similar 
situation arises.
 Analyze past reactions. Discuss what happened and how you can pre-
vent it from happening again. This proves to parents that the teen is
mature enough to use past mistakes to build future successes. I tell all
my patients that we all make mistakes and that reactions happen no
matter how hard you try to prevent them. Success is measured not
simply by the ability to prevent a reaction but also by the ability to 
learn how to more effectively prevent and deal with future reactions.
We all need to recognize that gaining independence is a process for both the
teen and the parents. Teenagers are often ready, willing, and even able to be
independent all at once. Parents may not be ready, willing, or able to accept
that independence, and they’re rarely willing to accept it all at once. Take it
one step at a time and be patient with one another. Realize that in a way,
you’re both raising each other.

Getting a Little Help from Your Friends
Managing a food allergy is a team sport. Naturally, as a teenager, you may
want to cut your parents from the team and take on more of the responsibil-
ity yourself. When you choose to do that, however, fill the empty slot with
someone who’s more capable, at this stage of the game, to assist you.
You don’t have to tell everyone that you have a food allergy, but let your clos-
est friends know about it. Describe the symptoms of an allergic reaction,
review prevention strategies, and explain what they should do if you experi-
ence a reaction when you’re together. Having a responsible friend keep an
eye on you may calm your parents and make them more willing to let you
wander a little farther from their protective embrace.
Friends can form a protective shield around you without making you feel like
a little kid. I frequently see friends who are far more willing to speak up about
the food allergy than the person with the allergy. I see friends who will virtu-
ally attack a restaurant waiter and even go in to inspect the kitchen while the
allergic teen is too shy to ask a single question. I see friends show up at
appointments to learn more about food allergy. I’ve even seen friends head
off to college together, so the friend can keep her pal safe on campus. Ask
one of your closest friends to be a pal, as explained in the following sidebar,
“Be A PAL.”
247
Chapter 14: Empowering Your Adolescent or Teenager
Be A PAL
FAAN has formalized the value of friends with
its Be A PAL (Protect A Life from food allergy)
program. The program encourages those with
food allergies to teach their friends about what
they can do to help prevent a reaction and what
to do should a reaction occur. According to
FAAN, your PAL should know the following: 
 The foods you need to avoid.
 That foods can be hidden in unexpected
places, so you need to ask questions about
what’s in the food and how it’s prepared.
 The symptoms you may have when experi-
encing an allergic reaction. 
 The medicine you need to take if you have
a reaction and where you keep it. 
 What to do and who to call in case you
have a reaction.
Nothing is more important to teens than their
friends, so make your friends an integral part of
your support network and protection program.
I encourage all my patients with food allergy,
especially teens, to talk to their friends and
teach them about food allergy. I have seen friends
prevent numerous reactions and take quick
action in the face of reactions. Every time I wit-
ness or hear about a friend saving a friend from
an allergic reaction, I realize what a beautiful
thing friendship can be. 

Mastering the Art of Acceptable 
Risk Taking 
Unrestrained joy, unfettered impulse, and a fair amount of risk taking are part
of the beauty of youth. Unfortunately, risk taking often manifests itself in
unacceptable and life-threatening ways, particularly with food allergies. A
recent study reveals that an alarming number of teenagers with food allergies
admit to purposefully ingesting problem foods, and that many teens also fail
to carry their medications with them. Perhaps this is why fatal food reactions
are most common among adolescents and young adults.
Now, I’m not one to throw a wet blanket on spontaneous teenage exuberance,
but I do get more than a little concerned when I hear about teenagers know-
ingly ingesting suspect foods and not carrying their medications. In fact, I’m
dumfounded when I hear such things, because in order to continue taking
risks as a teenager, living another day is rather important. By figuring out
how to take less life-threatening risks, you can pack a lot more acceptably
risky activities into your life.
Teenagers rarely intentionally take risks with their food allergies. Few
teenagers knowingly ingest problem foods to see what will happen or head
out of the house without their epinephrine autoinjectors for the thrill of it. In
most cases, they simply have an overwhelming and very understandable
need to fit in and be “normal.” The best way to achieve a sense of normalcy is
to make food allergy feel more normal. Increased education and open com-
munication between food allergic teens and their parents, friends, and doctor
can increase the sense of normalcy and help teens master their indepen-
dence while at the same time staying happy, relaxed, and safe.
While life is never entirely risk-free, knowingly ingesting a suspect food or
conveniently forgetting to carry life-saving medications is never acceptable.
The key is to find out which risks are okay and which are not and then do
whatever you can to limit the risks. While eating out may never be risk free,
for example, carefully choosing a restaurant and asking the right questions
can make eating out an acceptable risk. Eating dessert, however, no matter
how tempting or how much your date pushes you to do so, may never be an
acceptable risk.

Laying Down Some Safe 
Dating Guidelines
A food allergy can certainly cramp your style on a date. Fortunately, by agree-
ing to a few key dating rules up front, you can make your date safer, more
enjoyable, and perhaps even make you slightly less anxious:
 Let your date know about your allergy. In addition to assisting you in
avoiding problem foods, your date may need to know about your food
allergy to save your life in the event that you experience a severe reac-
tion. If you’re nervous about what to say, practice with a friend what you
should say and how to say it. 
 Keep your explanation brief. No need for a full medical history or a dis-
sertation on food allergy. Your date should understand, however, that an
allergic reaction could be very serious.
 Discuss the limitations up front. Let your date know which foods you
can and cannot eat and which restaurants you can eat at. Clearly explain
other restrictions before the date moves too far along. You may, for
example, tell your date that you are allergic to peanuts and she needs to
avoid eating peanuts and to brush her teeth and wash her hands if she
has eaten peanuts before the date. I know, telling your date to be sure to
brush her teeth and wash her hands may take some of the romance out
of the evening, but it may also keep you out of the emergency room,
which is not the most romantic place, either.
249
Chapter 14: Empowering Your Adolescent or Teenager
Documented food allergy risk taking
Researchers from the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine and FAAN used an anonymous ques-
tionnaire to survey 174 food allergy patients
between the ages of 13 and 21. 
The survey data revealed that more than half of
the respondents admitted to knowingly con-
suming a potentially unsafe food. Only 61 per-
cent always carried their epinephrine. Carrying
rates varied by activities or circumstances.
Activities such as traveling and going to restau-
rants had high carrying rates. However, the
rates were much lower for certain peer-related
social activities, such as going to a friend’s
home, participating in sports activities, wearing
tight clothing, or attending a school dance. 
The majority of respondents also indicated that
education of their friends would make living
with a food allergy easier. However, they did not
want to educate their peers themselves. The
researchers also concluded that patients who
take the most risks by eating problem foods and
not carrying epinephrine are the ones who are
likely to feel “different” because of their food
allergies. 

Eating out
Eating out, especially on a first date, always generates some anxiety. In a
public restaurant, few people like to call attention to themselves, particularly
when trying to impress a date. The trick here is to follow the rules discussed
in Chapter 11 in a way that’s a little less obvious but just as effective. Here
are some suggestions that can make your dinner out safe without making you
feel as though you’re eating on stage in the spotlight:
 Steer clear of risky restaurants. If you’re allergic to fish or shellfish, and
your date or your friends seem to be leaning toward seafood, steer them
in a different direction before the decision process gets too far along.
(This is when it really helps to have a PAL on your side.) The same goes
for Asian foods and peanut allergy. If you have a milk allergy, your date
needs to know up front that finding a safe restaurant may be very difficult.
 Pick a restaurant well in advance. Do as much legwork as possible
before you even get to the restaurant. If possible, pick a place you’ve
dealt with before and always call ahead of time and speak with the man-
ager or chef. Preparation well in advance streamlines the ordering
process.
 Keep your date and your friends at ease. To handle unplanned meet-
ings at restaurants, let your friends or your date know that they should
not be offended if you join them for dinner without ordering anything.
You may simply order a soda or water or eat a snack you brought from
home.
 Carry a chef’s card. The first chef’s card was created by a very smart
teenager who had severe food allergy and hated to ask too many ques-
tions publicly. A chef’s card does not replace calling ahead and asking
questions but it can streamline the process of ordering your meal and
may allow you to get a safe meal without calling much attention to your
allergy. Chapter 11 provides a sample chef’s card.
Acquiring a few safe-kissing skills
Not to be an alarmist, but when you have a severe food allergy, even a “harm-
less” kiss can be fatal. In 2006, a teenager in Canada died of an apparent aller-
gic reaction that may have occurred after kissing her boyfriend who had just
eaten peanut. 
Before this incident occurred, I warned my patients about kissing. Now, this
is often the first question that parents of teenagers ask me. The teens them-
selves don’t ask the question. In fact, they’re often mortified when their par-
ents ask this embarrassing question, but they do listen intently to the answer.
250
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

When you’re just getting to know someone, you may not feel quite ready to
tell the person about your food allergy. That’s perfectly understandable. Until
you’re ready to open up about your food allergy, however, stay on the safe
side by following these precautions:
 Avoid food-related activities. For example, plan dates before or after
mealtimes.
 If you eat, make sure you both eat only safe foods. Consider packing a
picnic lunch.
 Hold off on the kissing. Avoid kissing until you can be honest with your
date and feel that your date will respect your food restrictions.
When you do get ready to kiss, make sure your date knows how serious your
food allergy is and what he or she needs to do in order to prevent you from
having a reaction. Many teens tell me that their date has agreed to avoid the
allergy-causing food on days when they will be hanging out together. Others
say their boyfriends or girlfriends have cut the allergen out of their diets
entirely. 
Dating is all about spending time with a person you like to learn whether you
are comfortable with each other. If your date isn’t understanding or is pres-
suring you to take chances that might harm you, he may not be right for you!
On the other hand, if your new boyfriend makes an effort to learn about food
allergy and is genuinely concerned, he should automatically score a few
points with you (and your parents).
251
Chapter 14: Empowering Your Adolescent or Teenager
A fatal kiss
Can a kiss actually contain enough of an aller-
gen to cause a fatal reaction? This is the ques-
tion that researchers sought to answer in a
recent study. The answer they arrived at is
“Yes,” individuals with food allergies are at risk
of experiencing a reaction when kissing some-
one who has recently eaten the food to which
they are allergic.
The researchers measured the level of peanut
allergen in an individual’s saliva after eating a
peanut butter sandwich — both before and
after the participants brushed their teeth. The
study found that despite tooth brushing, aller-
gen levels were detectable for up to four hours
after a participant ate peanut butter. The study’s
authors concluded that in addition to brushing
their teeth, individuals who have consumed a
food should wait several hours before kissing
someone who’s allergic to that food. 
Anyone with a food allergy and everyone who’s
in a close relationship with someone who has
a food allergy should consider the risk. While it
may be an uncomfortable topic to bring up, it’s
definitely more comfortable to talk about it than
to have a reaction. Be honest and open. If your
date really cares about you, she’ll understand
and want to learn about what she can do to
keep you safe.

Preventing and Outgrowing 
a Food Allergy 
In This Chapter 
 Improving a child’s chances of staying allergy-free
 Assessing the likelihood of outgrowing food allergies
 Helping your body shake an existing food allergy
 Safely re-introducing problem foods to your diet
F
ood allergies are not the most predictable of illnesses. In some families,
one child becomes allergic to peanut on his first exposure to it, while a
half dozen of his siblings can chow down on peanuts without the slightest
hint of a reaction. A milk allergy becomes a lifelong companion to some,
while other kids suffer through a few milk-sensitive years and then can chug a
carton of milk without incident. 
We (doctors and researchers) can’t reliably predict the onset of food allergy
or the course it will eventually take, but we can provide some advice on pos-
sible strategies for preventing its onset and perhaps hastening its departure. 
This chapter explores the possibility of preventing food allergy in the first
place. It then delves into the likelihood of someone outgrowing an existing
food allergy. Here, I rank your chances of shaking a food allergy based on the
food or foods you react to and your sensitivity to those foods. I reveal vari-
ous techniques that may hasten the “cure.” And I guide you through the
process of safely introducing problem foods . . . with the approval and assis-
tance of your doctor, of course.

Preventing Food Allergies: 
Hope or Hype?
The dramatic increase in the prevalence of food allergies over the past 20
years or so proves that the medical community hasn’t exactly made great
strides in the prevention department. But we’re hard at work trying to figure
out why food allergies are on the rise and what we can do to prevent the
onset of these allergies. 
In the following sections, I provide a brief overview of what we currently
know in the areas of food allergy prevention and point out the most promis-
ing studies. Families that have a history of allergies may be able to improve
the chances that their children, especially their youngest children, can avoid
the onset of food allergy and perhaps other allergic conditions, including
asthma, by following the recommendations offered here.
The only two prevention strategies I recommend unconditionally are breast-
feeding (over bottle feeding) and the avoidance of tobacco smoke. These two
strategies can’t guarantee that your child will successfully dodge the food
allergy bullet, but they can improve the odds.
Stressing early intervention
Food allergies typically arise in the first two years of a child’s life, so preven-
tion strategies focus on these critical years. For high-risk families (families
with a history of allergic conditions, including asthma and allergic rhinitis),
many doctors recommend avoiding highly allergenic foods, including milk,
egg, and peanut, in the first two years of an infant’s life. Sometimes, doctors
also recommend that breastfeeding mothers avoid eating high-risk foods over
the duration of the breastfeeding years. 
No studies have proven conclusively that strict avoidance is effective in pre-
venting the onset of food allergies. In fact, a certain amount of exposure at
the right time may be beneficial, but since we don’t know how much expo-
sure at what age is optimum, and because the ideal amount of exposure and
the ideal age may vary from one person to another, we generally recommend
that high-risk families avoid high-risk foods during the critical ages — up to
three years of age. 
254
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Focusing on baby formulas
Because food allergy is more prevalent in developed countries, especially in
children, we asked ourselves, “What’s different about the way we raise chil-
dren in developed countries?” One difference that immediately pops up on
the radar screen is that instead of breastfeeding their children, parents in
developed countries rely more heavily on baby formula, most of which is
manufactured from — you guessed it — cow’s milk.
Tiffani Hayes, a pediatric nutritionist, and I published an article in September
of 2005, in which we reviewed the data from several studies on baby formulas.
What we discovered is that alternatives to cow’s milk formulas — including
extensively hydrolyzed casein formulas and partially hydrolyzed whey 
formulas — are appropriate alternatives to breast milk for allergy prevention
in infants at risk. 
Because nobody can predict the onset of any allergy-related disease in any
family, parents who cannot or choose not to breastfeed should consider the
use of extensively hydrolyzed casein formulas and partially hydrolyzed whey
formulas — hypoallergenic baby formulas. This becomes even more impor-
tant for families who have other children with allergic diseases such as atopic
dermatitis (eczema), food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. Consult your
doctor prior to giving birth to discuss the pros and cons of breastfeeding and
different types of baby formulas.
Clearing the smoke from the room
One of the few factors that have been proven without a doubt to contribute
to the onset of all types of allergies and asthma is cigarette smoke. If any of
the thousands of other good reasons to quit smoking can’t convinces some-
one to give up smoking for good, perhaps the fact that cigarette smoke has
been proven to increase a child’s vulnerability to allergic conditions will be
sufficient.
Taking action to prevent the onset 
of food allergies and asthma
Parents in families that have a strong history of food allergy and asthma are
often highly motivated to do whatever it takes to prevent the onset of food
255
Chapter 15: Preventing and Outgrowing a Food Allergy

allergies and asthma in all their children. The problem with giving strict rec-
ommendations, however, is that we currently have very little conclusive
proof on preventive strategies that work. Recommending questionable pre-
vention strategies can lead to other problems, such as malnutrition, or
simply waste your time and money on something that’s not effective.
My recommendation is to study the evidence for yourself, discuss the
options with your doctor, keep up on the latest breakthroughs in food allergy
research, and make the choices that you think are best for your child. In the
following list, I describe prevention strategies we’ve studied. The most effec-
tive strategies are listed first followed by more questionable options:
 Avoid tobacco smoke. Tobacco smoke is proven to contribute to the
onset of all allergy-related conditions. Avoiding exposure to tobacco
smoke, especially in the early years of life, can help stave off asthma,
food allergies, and other allergy-related conditions. 
 Breastfeed exclusively. If possible, avoid baby formula for at least the
first six months of your infant’s life. If you must use formula, choose a
hypo-allergenic formula. Although breastfeeding has not been conclu-
sively proven to prevent food allergies, it is far safer than cow’s milk and
has so many other health benefits that doctors don’t hesitate to recom-
mend it.
 Use hypo-allergenic baby formulas. This is a good idea for all 
families who cannot or choose not to breastfeed or as a supplement 
to breastfeeding.
 Restrict your diet while pregnant or breastfeeding. Some studies show
that this is effective, and some don’t. I recommend that all mothers con-
sider avoiding peanut and tree nuts during the last trimester of preg-
nancy and while breast feeding, especially mothers in high-risk families.
I do not routinely recommend restricting other common allergens, such
as milk and egg, since the evidence is not strong enough to justify
putting the mother or baby at nutritional risk.
 Introduce probiotics. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria, such as those in
yogurt. Some evidence shows that probiotics may help in preventing the
onset of food allergies. Refer to Chapter 9 for details on probiotics. 
 Waiting to introduce solid foods in the baby’s diet. Some studies have
shown this to be effective, and others have not. I recommend that babies
in high-risk families not be started on solids until 6 months of age.

Ranking the Likelihood of Outgrowing 
an Allergy Food by Food
A majority of children, even those with the most severe food allergies, often
simply outgrow their allergy. When this occurs, what exactly happened to
make the person less sensitive to the problem food? We don’t know for sure.
All we know is that sometimes the body makes a few internal adjustments
and the immune system stops overreacting to a particular food.
What are your or your child’s chances of outgrowing a food allergy? I can’t
say for sure on a case-by-case basis. Some food allergies are easier to out-
grow, and some people’s bodies seem better equipped than others to out-
grow a food allergy. I can, however, reveal some factors that may increase
your chances of outgrowing a food allergy, such as the type of food and the
severity of the reactions. In the following sections, I explore the chances of
outgrowing each of the most common food allergies.
In general, the less severe your food allergy, the more likely you are to out-
grow it.
Charting your chances with cow’s milk
In the United States, cow’s milk allergy affects about 2.5 percent of children
during their first two years of life. Fortunately, most kids (approximately 80
percent) will eventually outgrow their milk allergy, most within a few years of
their diagnosis.
257
Chapter 15: Preventing and Outgrowing a Food Allergy
Food allergy’s growing tenacity
Based on my observations, I’m afraid that food
allergies are becoming not only more common
over the years but also more tenacious. I don’t
have any official studies or data to back me up,
but I’ve noticed that over the past decade or so,
fewer people seem to be outgrowing their food
allergies.
Fortunately we now have studies underway to
try to explain this trend and shed some light on
why this phenomenon is occurring, assuming it
really is occurring. Perhaps the answers will
lead to a future cure or more effective treat-
ments. Stay tuned. 

Your chance of outgrowing milk allergy depends a great deal on whether your
allergy is IgE-mediated or not: 
 Non-IgE mediated cow’s milk allergy is almost always a transient condi-
tion that passes with age. Non-IgE mediated milk allergy typically causes
more subtle, delayed symptoms, such as allergic colitis, as discussed in
Chapter 7.
 IgE-mediated cow’s milk allergy is a more stubborn variety that persists
in about 20 percent of children, maybe more.
If you or your child has milk allergy, ask the doctor to specify whether it is
IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated. Outgrowing a non-IgE-mediated milk
allergy is almost guaranteed. Time is on your side. If the milk allergy is IgE-
mediated, then track the levels of M-IgE (milk-specific IgE) from one year to
the next and look for a significant drop in M-IgE levels. Studies show that
people with a higher percentage drop in the M-IgE level in a single year are
more likely to develop a milk tolerance regardless of how high their M-IgE
level when first diagnosed. In one study, a percentage drop of 50, 75, 90, and
99 percent correlated with a 31, 45, 66, and 99 percent chance of passing a
milk challenge, respectively. Once your M-IgE level drops far enough, your
doctor may want to consider performing a food challenge to determine
whether you’ve outgrown your milk allergy.
Outgrowing an allergy to eggs
In the United States, egg allergy affects about 1 to 2 percent of children. As
with milk allergy, however, a majority of kids outgrow egg allergy within a few
years:
 About half of those diagnosed with egg allergy outgrow the allergy
within a couple years.
 About two thirds outgrow the allergy by the time they’re five.
 Even more children become less sensitive to eggs, even if they don’t
completely outgrow the allergy.
As with cow’s milk allergy, the rate at which egg-specific IgE (E-IgE) levels
drop may determine the likelihood that a child has outgrown the allergy. In a
group of children who developed egg allergy before the age of four, the per-
centage drop in E-IgE in one year correlated with the likelihood that the child
would pass a food challenge performed at that time. An E-IgE drop of 50, 75,
90, and 99 percent correlated with a 52, 65, 78, and 95 percent chance of pass-
ing the food challenge, respectively. As with milk allergy, if your E-IgE level
258
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

falls sufficiently, performing a food challenge for egg may confirm a develop-
ing tolerance for egg.
Winning out against wheat 
and soy allergies 
Although we haven’t performed specific studies on the likelihood of outgrow-
ing a wheat or soy allergy, the prognosis for outgrowing either allergy is very
positive:
 80–90 percent of those with a wheat or soy allergy outgrow the allergy
by the age of five or six years. 
 In a study of children with food allergy and allergy-related dermatitis, 50
percent of the children with soy allergy outgrew it in a year, and 67 per-
cent outgrew it within two years. Only 25 percent of the children with
wheat allergy outgrew their allergy within a year, and only 33 percent
outgrew the wheat allergy within two years.
As with milk and egg, those who are more sensitive to soy and wheat may
have a more difficult time outgrowing their allergies. 
Overpowering a peanut allergy
Until recently, most food allergy specialists concurred that people rarely, if
ever, outgrew a peanut allergy, and almost every study supported that belief.
Relatively recently, however, new studies have shown that approximately 20
to 25 percent of people who have peanut allergy eventually outgrow it.
What does this mean for you or your child who’s been diagnosed with peanut
allergy? It means that outgrowing peanut allergy is rather unlikely, but don’t
give up hope, and don’t let anyone convince you that outgrowing a peanut
allergy is impossible. A substantial percentage of people lose their sensitivity
to peanut, so I recommend asking your doctor to reevaluate you or your
child at least once a year, at least up to the age of six years:
 Test PN-IgE levels annually and monitor these levels over time. Low or
undetectable levels of PN-IgEa are a pretty good indication that you’ve
outgrown a peanut allergy, but about 30 percent of those with low or
even undetectable levels of PN-IgE still experience reactions. 
259
Chapter 15: Preventing and Outgrowing a Food Allergy

 If you haven’t had a reaction in the past year or two and your PN-IgE
level tests below 2 kUA/L, discuss with your doctor the possibility of an
oral peanut challenge to determine if you’ve outgrown your peanut
allergy. 
 If you pass the peanut challenge, consult with your doctor about eating
peanut regularly. Not eating peanut regularly may be a risk factor for re-
sensitization, as explained in the following sidebar.
Don’t try this at home. Food challenges, particularly peanut challenges,
should always be performed in a controlled setting with emergency medica-
tions readily available.

Fighting peanut allergy with peanuts?!
The funny thing about a peanut allergy is that if
you outgrow the allergy and then continue to
avoid peanuts, you may actually be more likely
to become allergic to peanuts again. 
We performed a follow-up study in 36 patients
who had a clear history of peanut allergy. Of the
36 patients, three of them (8 percent) experi-
enced a recurrence of peanut allergy after
having successfully passed a peanut chal-
lenge. A six-year-old girl was representative of
the three who experienced a relapse. When
she was a year old, she ate a peanut butter
cracker. Within five minutes, she broke out in
hives and her face swelled up. Her PN-IgE level
at diagnosis was 2.79 kUA/L, and she had no
history of other food allergies. At age 4.5 years,
her PN-IgE level was 1.1 kUA/L, and she passed
a peanut challenge. She subsequently ate only
“may contain peanut” products until approxi-
mately 1.8 years after the initial challenge.
One day, she decided to eat some Butterfinger
ice cream. Within 15 minutes of taking two bites
of the ice cream, she developed hives, cough-
ing, difficulty breathing, throat tightness, abdom-
inal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. A repeat PN-IgE
level was greater than 100 kUA/L. All three
patients who relapsed after successfully pass-
ing the peanut challenge consumed concen-
trated peanut products less than once a month.
In other words, the patients who relapsed had
avoided peanuts!
In contrast, none of a group of 23 patients who
ate peanut more frequently after having passed
their peanut challenge had recurrent peanut
allergy. Thus, infrequent exposure may be a risk
factor for re-sensitization. This may also be why
recurrence is virtually unheard of with other
common food allergies, such as milk and egg.
Even if you hate milk after outgrowing your
allergy, you’re probably getting some form of
concentrated milk on a regular basis, because
it’s such a common ingredient.

Shaking a tree nut allergy
Tree nut allergy may actually be tougher to outgrow than peanut allergy,
although few studies prove it. In our own study, we found that about 9 per-
cent (9 of 101) children with tree nut allergy outgrew their allergy. The rate of
resolution corresponded to the TN-IgE (tree nut specific IgE) level:
 TN-IgE level below 5 kUA/L, 58 percent resolution.
 TN-IgE level below 2 kUA/L, 63 percent resolution.
 Undetectable TN-IgE level, 75 percent resolution.
As with peanut allergy, monitor your TN-IgE level closely from one year to the
next. If the TN-IgE level drops below 5 kUA/L, consult with your doctor to
determine if a tree nut challenge would be advisable.
Surmounting a seed allergy
Allergies to sesame, sunflower, or other types of seeds tend to persist, although
no studies provide conclusive evidence to support this. Your doctor may
want to monitor your IgE levels for sesame and perform a sesame challenge 
if your IgE level drops, but we have no specific sesame-specific IgE levels or
percentage drops to recommend for testing.
Overcoming other food allergies
Milk, egg, and peanut are the main players in childhood food allergies. Wheat,
soy, and sesame play relatively minor roles. Some other foods make cameo
appearances. These include certain fruits, vegetables, and cereal grains other
than wheat. Fortunately, most kids outgrow allergies to fruits, veggies, and
grains within a period of six to 12 months. Many of the reactions may repre-
sent intolerances or irritant reactions rather than true food allergy. Of course,
in at least a few cases, children do develop severe IgE-mediated allergies to
these foods that may persist. 
I haven’t said much about seafood (fish and shellfish) up to this point,
because seafood allergies more commonly develop later in life. In any event,
seafood allergies are perhaps the most tenacious of the bunch. Estimates 
of seafood allergy resolution range from 3.5 percent for fish to 4 percent for
shellfish.
261
Chapter 15: Preventing and Outgrowing a Food Allergy

Whipping multiple food allergies
Some kids seem to be allergic to everything — milk, egg, wheat, peanut, you
name it. You may think that these poor kids are just destined to remain aller-
gic to everything. Well, that assumption holds some truth — as a general
rule, multiple food allergies may slightly reduce your ability to outgrow any
food allergy, but an inability to outgrow one food allergy doesn’t affect your
ability to outgrow a different food allergy.
We found this rather surprising. When we began our studies, we predicted
that if a child could not outgrow a food allergy that was relatively easy to out-
grow, such as milk or egg, the child would never outgrow a stubborn peanut
allergy. Boy, were we wrong. Several children we studied had persistent milk
or egg allergy but managed to lose their peanut allergy. Go figure.
Your chances of outgrowing one food allergy has nothing to do with your abil-
ity or inability to outgrow another food allergy. Monitor all your food-specific
IgE levels and treat each food allergy as a separate condition.  
Accounting for other allergic conditions
Having other allergic conditions, such as asthma or eczema or hay fever, may
also reduce the chance of outgrowing a food allergy. In other words, a child
with just food allergy may have better odds of outgrowing his food allergy
than a child with food allergy plus asthma or eczema. Most children, how-
ever, have other allergy-related conditions in addition to their food allergy, so
studying food allergy in isolation is a bit difficult.
The results of our studies showed that the presence of other allergic condi-
tions reduced the chances of outgrowing some food allergies, such as milk,
but the presence of other allergic conditions did not affect the likelihood of
outgrowing peanut allergy.
Speculating on the Timing
When patients and their parents hear the good news that food allergies can
be outgrown, they often ask how long it’ll take — a year, two years, five
years? Timing is tough to predict. Some children outgrow a milk allergy
before they’re out of diapers. Others have to wait until they get their driver’s
license. A number of less fortunate food allergy sufferers never seem to shake
their allergy.
262
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

Nobody can accurately predict the date and time you can expect to outgrow
your food allergy or even guarantee that you’ll outgrow it, but I can give you
a general idea of what to expect based on IgE levels and exposure:
 In our studies, the best predictor of timing is the level of food-specific
IgE. For example, consider three two-year-olds with milk or egg allergy
who have IgE levels (RASTs) of 1, 15, and 75 (all on a scale of 0 to 100).
The child with the level of 1 is likely to outgrow the food allergy very
soon, if she hasn’t done so already. The child with the level of 15 could
still outgrow her allergy, but it’ll probably take her at least three years.
The child with the level of 75 is unlikely to outgrow her allergy, but if it
were to happen, it would take at least five to seven years.
 Another predictor is how a patient responds to a food challenge or acci-
dental exposure. If a child reacts to a tiny exposure, for example, espe-
cially if it is a significant reaction, he is likely to be at least a few years
away from outgrowing the allergy, no matter what the other test results
say. On the other hand, someone who tolerates more of the food before
reacting is logically closer to losing the allergy.
These predictors are just that — indications of the likelihood of outgrowing a
food allergy in a certain period of time. They offer no money-back guarantee.
As I said earlier in this chapter, some people with undetectable levels of a
food-specific IgE may continue to react to the food.
Prodding Your Allergy to Vacate Sooner
Food allergies are like uninvited guests who stay long past their welcome. So,
how do you get them to leave? The best advice I can offer is based on the
best information we currently have — strictly avoid the problem food. 
In practice, some children rapidly outgrow their food allergies without strict
avoidance, while others fail to outgrow their food allergies despite the most
stringent diets. Because strict avoidance is so difficult, understanding the
impact of continued exposure on the natural history of food allergy would be
helpful. However, until we do, the majority of children with food allergy are
more likely to benefit from strict avoidance, at least to dodge symptoms and
hopefully to hasten the departure of their food allergies.
Strict avoidance has been the mainstay of food allergy management and con-
tinues to be the best treatment approach to prevent reactions, keep the con-
dition from worsening, and hasten the process of becoming allergy-free. This
advice, however, may change in the future, as we gather more data and
explore other treatment options.
263
Chapter 15: Preventing and Outgrowing a Food Allergy

Monitoring and Managing Your Allergies 
You and your doctor should keep an eye on your food allergies and tweak the
treatment approach as your body adjusts. This is particularly important
when treating food allergies in children, because children are more likely to
outgrow their food allergy and because they’re more dependent on certain
foods for normal growth and development. To stay abreast of the changing
nature of food allergies in your child, work with your doctor to:
 Ensure proper nutrition, growth, and development.
 Track accidental exposures and reactions to ensure that avoidance mea-
sures are adequate and that you’re recognizing reactions promptly and
treating them appropriately.
 Have sufficient supplies of fresh emergency medications, including epi-
nephrine autoinjectors, for home and for your child’s daycare, school,
and wherever else she spends time.
 Ensure that all caregivers understand the allergy management plan and
emergency medical treatment plan. Your doctor should provide you with
an allergy management plan in writing.
 Evaluate your child regularly to determine whether she’s outgrown her
food allergy. In our clinic, we typically test once a year, but longer or
shorter intervals may be more appropriate is some situations. A child
with a reaction to fruit, for example, may be evaluated every six months,
whereas an older child with persistent peanut allergy may not require
annual testing after the first few years if he shows no sign of improvement.
Your child’s allergist may choose any of several methods to evaluate your
child for the disappearance of food allergy, including information on acciden-
tal exposures, skin-prick testing, in-vitro testing, or blood tests. No single
method has proven most effective. In our clinic, we typically rely on clinical
history and CAP-RAST (FEIA) testing to monitor food allergy progression in
our patients. We generally do not perform repeat skin testing, because we
think it doesn’t change our management in the majority of cases, although
other centers perform repeat skin testing on a regular basis.
If a child hasn’t had a reaction in the past six to 12 months, I recommend that
the child be re-evaluated in the following ways based on the problem food:
 IgE-mediated cow’s milk or egg: About 50 percent of children who have
a milk or egg allergy shake the allergy by the age of 6 years old. We rec-
ommend retesting yearly with CAP-RAST testing. The rate of decline can
predict the likelihood that a challenge will be negative. We usually offer
264
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

a food challenge for milk and egg when the M-IgE or E-IgE level is less
than 2 kUA/L, which gives the patient an approximately 50 percent
chance of passing the challenge. 
 Non-IgE-mediated milk or egg: Kids tend to outgrow non-IgE-mediated
milk and egg allergies more quickly. If the child has had no recent reac-
tions from accidental exposure, a careful challenge is warranted by the
age of two or three years old. Be careful, though. If your child has been
diagnosed with food-protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES),
reintroducing milk or egg poses a significant potential risk. Prior to rein-
troducing milk or egg, your doctor should perform a careful food chal-
lenge under close supervision in a hospital setting.
 Peanut or tree nuts: If you have a peanut or tree nut allergy, consult
your doctor to obtain annual CAP-RAST testing. If your TN- or PN-IgE
level is less than 2 kUA/L, you and your doctor may consider a super-
vised challenge. If the challenge confirms that you’ve outgrown your
peanut or tree nut allergy, your doctor may advise you to eat the prob-
lem nut at least once a month to prevent re-sensitization. We don’t know
the optimal amount you should eat, but we generally recommend a
single serving — for example, the amount of peanut in a peanut butter
sandwich or a candy bar with nuts. Follow up with your doctor for at
least a year to ensure that you’re not experiencing recurrent symptoms.
In patients with persistent peanut allergy, or if the CAP-RAST remains
unchanged for several years, less frequent testing is usually sufficient.
 Wheat and soy: Children usually outgrow their wheat and soy allergies
more quickly than allergies to milk or egg. If your child has a wheat or
soy allergy, see your doctor yearly for reevaluation with CAP-RAST test-
ing. When wheat- or soy-specific IgE levels are low, you and your doctor
may consider attempting a supervised food challenge. “Low” levels for
wheat and soy are not as well-defined as they are for other common
allergenic foods.
 Other foods: If you’re allergic to some other food not included in this
list, we recommend annual evaluations and testing. As mentioned previ-
ously, repeat evaluation can be less frequent if the allergy is showing
little sign of improvement.
Testing negative doesn’t mean you’ve outgrown your allergy, nor does testing
positive mean that you still have it. A negative test merely enables you and
your doctor to gauge the likelihood that you’ve outgrown your food allergy
and that a food challenge may be safe and useful. Only by successfully pass-
ing a food challenge can you be certain that the allergy is gone. 
265
Chapter 15: Preventing and Outgrowing a Food Allergy

Never perform a food challenge on your own — proceed with caution under
your doctor’s supervision, and with full emergency equipment and medica-
tions on hand to treat possible reactions.
Safely Reintroducing the Problem Foods
Say you’ve managed to raise your child with a severe food allergy for a
couple years. You’ve mastered the fine art of avoidance. Your kid doesn’t
mind not eating a particular food. In fact, he seems to dislike the food. Why
would you even consider taking the risk of re-introducing the problem food?
Why not leave well-enough alone? I have several good answers to offer for
that question:
 Knowing that your child has outgrown the food allergy can reduce your
family’s anxiety.
 Your child automatically increases the variety of foods he can safely 
consume.
 By not knowing that your child has outgrown the food allergy, you may
increase the risk that your child will become re-sensitized to the food.
Based on your child’s history, the severity of past reactions, the most recent
test results, and the problem food, your doctor may decide that your child is
ready for a food challenge or for you to try to re-introduce the food at home
(if the risk of a severe reaction is very low).
If your doctor recommends that you re-introduce the problem food at home
and you’re not comfortable doing that, request a supervised food challenge
in the doctor’s office. If your child passes the food challenge without inci-
dent, you’re likely to be less worried about adding the food to your child’s
diet. I rarely recommend introducing the food at home if the child has a
peanut allergy or has had acute reactions to the problem food until the child
passes a food challenge.
Confronting your allergies 
with food challenges 
Although CAP-RAST tests provide a fairly good indication of whether you’ve
outgrown an allergy, they offer no guarantee. You can have low food-specific
IgE levels and still experience an allergic reaction, or you can have relatively
266
Part III: Living Well with Your Food Allergies 

high food-specific IgE levels and safely consume the food. The only way to be
certain that you’ve outgrown your food allergy is to try eating the problem
food — challenge your system.
The problem with challenging your system with a food that has made you ill
before is that it can be somewhat risky, particularly if you experienced severe
reactions in the past. To increase safety, we normally perform a food chal-
lenge in our clinic under doctor’s supervision with emergency equipment and
medication on hand. 
What can you expect from a food challenge? A food challenge typically pro-
ceeds as follows:
1. Your doctor or your doctor’s assistant feeds you a specific amount of
the problem food that you’re likely to tolerate.
2. You sit in the room for a period of time under close observation for any
signs of a reaction. (If you react, the doctor or assistant obviously treats
you for the reaction.)
3. Pass the food challenge, and the doctor sends you home with instruc-
tions for safely re-introducing the food at home. Usually you start with
the amount of food that you ate during the food challenge and then grad-
ually ramp up the dose over the course of a week or more.
Inviting problem foods into your home
If your doctor recommends introducing the food into your child’s diet at
home, follow the doctor’s instructions carefully and proceed slowly.
Gradually increase the amount of the problem food in the diet over the
course of 1 to 2 weeks. When introducing milk into the diet, I typically advise
parents to start with one teaspoon on the first day or two and then double
the dose every one to two days. If you get up to 4 to 6 ounces in a day with
no reaction you’re probably home free.
Once you can tolerate a full serving of the food over a period of several days,
your doctor is likely to lift all restrictions, so you can consume all forms of
the food.

R
aising children and teenagers who have food allergies is even more chal-
lenging than living with your own food allergy. Not only do you have to
steer clear of problem foods in grocery stores and restaurants, but as a parent,
you have to protect your child at school and after school and educate your
child to protect herself and eventually take ownership of her food allergies.
Moreover, you need to pull off this juggling act in a way that doesn’t instill
unnecessary fear and anxiety.
In this chapter, I reveal the top ten talking points that you, as a parent, should
pass along to your allergic children to help them successfully handle their
food allergies both physically and emotionally.
Finding Comfort in Numbers: Lots 
of People Have Food Allergies
One of the most frequently lodged childhood complaints is this: “That’s not
fair!” Parents, grandparents, teachers, and babysitters drill the fairness rule
into kids from before the time the kids even learn the language. The rule is
one of the critical lessons to learn in the socialization process. Without it,

total chaos would certainly ensue. Adults would be wrestling in the streets,
intentionally smashing into one another on the roads, and strangling their 
co-workers.
By about 5th grade, children slowly experience the epiphany that life isn’t
always fair. Children who have allergies often pick up on it much sooner —
typically around the age of 3 or 4 years — when they realize that they can’t
eat everything that their friends and siblings are eating.
As a parent, the most you can do to overcome your child’s frustration is to let
your child realize that he’s not alone. Following are some tips on how to help
your child find comfort in numbers:
 Tell your child that nearly 12 million people in the United States alone
have food allergies. That’s a lot more people than she can count on her
fingers and toes. Three million children in the United States have food
allergies — that’s about 1 in every 25 kids.
 Connect with parents in your neighborhood who are struggling with
food allergies in their families. The more you network with other par-
ents, the more you realize that you and your child are not the only
people struggling with food allergies.
 Join a local food allergy support group or create a mini-support group
at your child’s school. In a support group your child has contact with
other children in the neighborhood whom life is treating not so fairly. In
the process of finding support for your child, you also gain support for
yourself, along with some practical information and tips, allergist recom-
mendations, and suggestions concerning other useful resources. 
 Encourage your child to visit FANKids (the Food Allergy &
Anaphylaxis Network’s Web site for kids) at www.fankids.org or
FANTeen (Food Allergies in the Real World) at www.faanteen.org.
See Chapter 19 for more Web sites, including FAAN’s main Web site.
You can track down a local food allergy support group by asking your aller-
gist, searching the Web, contacting FAAN, or talking with your allergist. Your
county or city health agency may also be able to provide you with a list of
local support groups.
Decoding Labels and Asking Questions
Children are often much more capable of taking on additional responsibility
than we, as parents, give them credit for. From birth, they struggle to control
272
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

their environment. As teenagers they often mutiny in an attempt to take con-
trol of your house. You can empower your children and teenagers to take
more control of their food allergies by providing them with the information
and tools they need to do the job:
 As soon as your child can read, teach her how to read food labels, 
as I explain in Chapter 6. Make a game out of it to see who can spot the
hidden foods on a candy bar label or a box of cereal. Advise your child
to read the label every time before unwrapping a food — manufacturers
sometimes change the ingredients in a food, so just because a food was
safe doesn’t mean it’s always safe.
 Foster a sense of curiosity about food allergies by encouraging your
child to ask questions. By learning to ask questions, your child becomes
less dependent on you for the answers. When she eventually ventures
out on her own to a local eating establishment, she is better prepared to
grill the cook and restaurant manager for information about what’s in
the food.
Treat your child’s food allergies matter-of-factly, with the detachment of a sci-
entist. Children can quickly spot your fears, whether you express them ver-
bally, in your tone of voice, or through your facial expressions or body
language. I know that suppressing your own fears and concerns can be a
monumental task, but do your best to keep them in check. 
Teaching Your Friends a Thing or Two
Your child doesn’t have to stand up in front of the entire second grade class
and give a PowerPoint presentation on food allergies, but he may be able to
gain acceptance and support by teaching classmates and friends about his
food allergy. Encourage your child to engage her friends and playmates in dis-
cussions about her food allergies. Friends often prove to be great protectors,
both medically and socially. 
Sometimes simply stating that you have a food allergy and that eating a 
particular food makes you sick is sufficient to spark a healthy dialogue with
playmates.
273
Chapter 16: Teaching Your Child Ten Key Food Allergy Lessons

Sitting at the Cleanest 
Table in the Cafeteria
As I explain in Chapter 3, allergens, including peanut protein are easily
cleaned from cafeteria tables with common household cleaning solutions.
Not all school cafeterias, however, follow strict cleanliness guidelines, espe-
cially when they have multiple shifts of students shuffling in and out. Encourage
your child to sit at the cleanest table in the cafeteria or ask one of the kitchen
crew to wipe off the table before lunch. 
To maximize safety without having to draw too much attention, consider
packing wet wipes and a small placemat in your child’s lunchbox, just in case.
If your child has a peanut allergy, and the school has a peanut-free table, that
may be the safest option and hopefully does not result in too much isolation.
To limit the isolation factor, a friend who intentionally does not bring in
peanut butter can sit with your child. 
Eating Off a Plate or Napkin
Even if your child’s school has a great food allergy policy in place and an
immaculately clean cafeteria, encourage your child to eat off a small plate or
a napkin, both at home and away from home. If a few errant scraps of food or
allergen residue remains on a table, a plate or napkin can prevent them from
finding their way into your child’s meal. Besides, eating over a plate or napkin
keeps everything a little cleaner. Packing a small placemat, as discussed in
the previous section, is a great idea, but if you forget to pack it, a paper plate
or napkin is usually available.
Steering Clear of Sloppy Eaters
You’ve been in a lunchroom, and you know that not all kids strive to achieve
the same standards of lunchroom etiquette. If your child has severe reactions
to peanut butter and happens to sit next to some kid who has peanut butter
all over his hands and somehow can’t keep his hands off other kids, a change
in seating arrangements may be in order. 
Advise your child to steer clear of any sloppy eaters, but if the sloppy eater
happens to be your child’s best friend, a little education may be in order.
274
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Your child or a responsible adult may need to teach the friend a thing or two,
as explained earlier in this chapter.
Avoiding Lunch Room Food 
Swaps and Food Fights
More trades occur in the average school cafeteria in an afternoon than in a
day at the New York Stock Exchange. Sandwiches and snacks always look a
little tastier when they’re sitting on someone else’s plate. 
For a child who has food allergies, however, food swapping is taboo and may
be dangerous. Your child has no way of knowing what’s in a food that’s not in
its original wrapper, how that food was prepared, or what it touched between
the other kid’s house and the school. Make sure your child understands how
important it is to eat only what he brings to the table — only foods that you,
your child’s parents, have approved.
Your child’s school should have a no-tolerance policy concerning food fights.
Some kids may think they’re just having fun, but to subject a fellow student
who has a severe food allergy to a food fight is borderline assault.
Stocking up on Some Healthy, 
Yet Yummie Snacks
Up until junior high, most schools are party schools . . . at least some of the
time. Teachers celebrate birthdays, Valentine’s day, Halloween, and parents
send in all sorts of goodies for the class. To enable your child to participate
fully in the festivities, send in some allergen-free snacks on the day of the
party. Better yet, deliver a small supply of snacks for the teacher to keep on
hand, or volunteer to make treats for the whole class. I know many mothers
of food allergic children who have simply become the baker for all parties. 
Ask the teacher to send a letter home to parents explaining that a child in the
class has a particular food allergy and informing them that when their snack
day rolls around to please send in a snack that’s free of the problem food.
Include a list of common names used for the food, as explained in Chapter 6.
275
Chapter 16: Teaching Your Child Ten Key Food Allergy Lessons

Asking for Help Immediately when 
You Start Feeling Funny
Children are often too embarrassed to ask for help when they’re feeling ill at
school, but when your child has a food allergy, the sooner she gets appropri-
ate treatment the better, especially if she experiences severe reactions. 
Foster an awareness in your child of the potential early warning signs and
symptoms of a reaction. Teach your child the following three important
points:
 Your symptoms may differ with each reaction, so be aware of all the
potential symptoms, as described in Chapter 2.
 You may start feeling funny right after eating, but symptoms can occur
at any time. The most common initial symptom is itching in the mouth
so warn them to be on guard for this one.
 Inform your child that she is to seek assistance immediately if she
notices any of these early warning signs:
• Itching, especially in or around the mouth.
• A sense that something is terribly wrong. We often refer to this as
“a sense of impending doom,” which is incredibly common even
before other symptoms start.
• Rash.
• Queasy feeling.
• Tightness in the throat or any difficulty breathing.
Even if your child knows what to do, he may be too embarrassed or physi-
cally unable to ask for help. Teachers and caregivers may need to intervene.
Chapters 12 and 13 provide additional suggestions on policies and proce-
dures for daycare, preschool, and kindergarten through high school.
Carrying a Health Emergency Card
Every child should carry a health emergency card that includes her name
and address, parents’ work and phone numbers, family doctor’s phone
number, a list of any health conditions she has; and brief instructions on
276
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

what to do in the event of an emergency. Figure 16-1 shows a sample card for
a child who has a food allergy. 
Make the creation of a health emergency card a fun group project. Create a
custom card for each member of the family or each student in the class.
Encourage your child to personalize his card with funky (but legible) fonts,
wild colors, and a cool background. Most kids love to create their own publi-
cations on the computer. 
Wearing a medical ID bracelet is another option. See Chapter 11 for details.

Packing Ten Key Food Allergy 
Tips for Camp, College, 
and Other Outings 
In This Chapter 
 Packing and planning for a safe stay away from home 
 Checking the expiration dates on your pill containers
 Adjusting your emergency plan for your destination
 Implementing a food allergy buddy system
E
ventually, your child is going to venture out on her own, leaving the
allergy safe house you call home. This may begin with something simple
like a sleepover at a friend’s house, but over time may include summer camp,
vacation with a friend’s family, travel to a foreign land as an exchange stu-
dent, moving off to college, or hiking the Appalachian Trail.
Venturing out presents both a challenge for your child and an opportunity for
him to experience more freedom and assume more responsibility for manag-
ing his food allergy. In this chapter, I provide ten tips to help smooth the tran-
sition, ease your mind as a parent, and make the experience a little safer.
Packing Fresh Medications
A week or two before your child (or teenager) heads out to a friend’s house,
camp, college, or some other venture, check the food allergy medications to
ensure the following:

 Your child has sufficient supplies to last the duration of the sojourn.
 Medications are in their original prescription bottles and are clearly
labeled with your child’s name. (Many camps and other institutions
refuse to administer medication that’s not in its original prescription
bottle.)
 Expiration dates indicate that the medications are not to expire until
after your child returns home.
 Detailed prescription information that describes how much of the med-
ication to take and when your child should take it.
 At least two epinephrine (EpiPen or Twinject) autoinjectors, if pre-
scribed. Check the expiration dates on the injectors, too.
 If plane travel is needed, be sure you have a letter from your doctor per-
mitting you to carry medicines on the plane.
When your teenager decides to study abroad for a semester or seek his for-
tune in college or in the more real world, arrange for a doctor’s visit soon
after your teenager arrives at his new destination. Most colleges have an on-
campus clinic complete with doctors and nurses, but your teenager must
know exactly who to contact in the event of an emergency or when he’s run-
ning low on his medications. Ask your child’s allergist for a recommendation.
Allergists have access to board-certified allergy specialists around the coun-
try through their specialty societies. This information may be of use in identi-
fying an appropriate provider in another part of the country if the travels are
within the U.S.
Taking Your Allergy Free 
Diet on the Road
At home, where the kitchen is well-stocked with allergen-free foods and
snacks and everyone is well-versed in proper food preparation, remaining
reaction free is manageable, if not always easy. On a trip, try your best to re-
create the controlled situation of your home, by taking the following actions:
 Speak directly to the head of the food service at the camp, school, or
other institution. Ask the head honcho to explain policies regarding
food allergy and how they educate the kitchen staff about food allergy.
 Inquire about how they use the specific foods that concern you. Some
camps and schools, for example, have a self-serve peanut butter bar that
can create a real mess. 
280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Ask to see the menu before you arrive. This may help you to identify
other red flags.
 Ask about food in the bunks, dorm rooms, and other areas where
your child may come into contact with others. Consider arranging for a
single room, or at least obtain assurance that your child will not have to
room with a peanut-snack addict.
 Arrange a visit to the kitchen. Any place you can trust should be happy
to have you inspect their kitchen. Examine the foods they have on their
shelves, and ask questions about food preparation and risks of cross-
contamination.
 Once you have sorted out the menu and the kitchen set-up, you and
your child can select safe foods for her stay. After the initial inspection,
however, your child will need to remain vigilant about any changes in
the menu or food preparation. For longer stays, such as spending the
school year on campus, intermittent calls or meetings with the food 
service manager can keep you in the loop, as well.
 Have your child pack enough snacks to last him for the duration of his
trip plus a few extras, just in case. On a trip, allergen-free snacks may
not be as readily available as they are at home. 
Most summer camps have a camp store or canteen where the campers can
purchase snacks. Consider having your child’s snacks stored in the camp
store, so he doesn’t eat them or give them all away on his first day. This can
also help your child feel more like one of the gang when everyone lines up in
the camp store to buy snacks. People working the camp store should know
your child has a food allergy and that they need to read the label every time
before dispensing any snacks to your child.
Packing Emergency Information 
and Instructions
Prompt, well-trained, and well-coordinated action is essential to properly
deal with allergic reactions, especially severe reactions. Like CPR, if you have
to teach someone what to do during the emergency, the lesson may already
be too late. No matter how long your child plans to be away from home, send
emergency information and instructions to your point person. (See the next
section for details about selecting a point person.) You may include allergy
information on a health form, application, or (preferably) as a separate docu-
ment that can be copied and distributed to key personnel. Instructions
should include the following:
281
Chapter 17: Packing Ten Key Food Allergy Tips for Camp, College, and Other Outings

 List the foods that your child is allergic to. Include specific foods along
with common names that appear on labels. See Chapter 6 for details.
 Describe the specific symptoms that your child typically experiences,
along with symptoms that your child may experience, as described in
Chapter 2.
 Provide step-by-step instructions on how to administer medications.
You can find instructions for using EpiPen at www.anaphylaxis.com.
Instructions for using Twinject are available at www.twinject.com.
Provide trainers (an EpiPen or Twinject look-alike that is used to familiar-
ize people with the device) and make sure everyone who might need to
is fully familiar with this device. (Trainers are typically provided along
with your prescription.)
Identifying One or More Point Persons
The support network you built at home and in your community does your
child little good when she hits the road. Before she sets out, create a new
support network at the planned destination. Begin by identifying and contact-
ing your point person — a responsible adult, preferably one who knows about
food allergies, who communicates directly with you and distributes essential
information to all those who need to know. In a camp situation, this may be
the camp director or nurse. In college, the campus medical center and the
resident assistant in the dorm may be good choices.
Educate your point person, as explained later in the section, “Training
Counselors and Other Personnel,” so he knows the foods that your child is
allergic to, potential symptoms to watch for, and emergency procedures.
Make sure that this person is comfortable with the epinephrine injector and
that she completely understands your emergency action plan. Have your
point person pass this information to others who are responsible for your
child. In a summer camp situation, for example, the following people need to
know what to look for and what to do in the event of a reaction:
 Counselors
 Camp nurse
 Drivers
 Cooks and cafeteria workers
 Camp store workers
 Lifeguards
 Volunteers who may visit the camp
282
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Tweaking Your Emergency Plan
Your existing emergency plan may be foolproof at home, but when your child
travels, that plan is often useless. Tweak your emergency plan to fit the situa-
tion. A solid emergency plan contains the following items:
 Immediate treatment in the form of medications, including epinephrine
autoinjectors.
 Name of the person or people who are best equipped to deal with a
severe reaction, including how to contact them immediately.
 Location and contact information for the nearest emergency care facility.
 Transportation to the emergency care facility. Find out whether the
ambulances that service the area carry epinephrine or not, and if you
can request that a unit capable of administering epinephrine be sent.
 Communication on the way to the emergency care facility — a cell
phone.
Everyone who cares for your child should know the emergency plan details
well in advance of any possible reaction.
Training Counselors and Other Personnel
If the people who are caring for your child or teen are not well trained in deal-
ing with food allergies, consider holding a brief training session. This is espe-
cially useful for summer camps that have little or no experience with food
allergies. Your training presentation should include a description of food
allergy, the fact that even small exposures can be deadly, and instructions on
the use of all medications. Make it clear that they really do not want your
child to die on their watch.
Practicing a “mock” reaction scenario can be very useful for the people who
will be caring for your child or teen with food allergy.
Work with your point person to schedule your presentation, so that everyone
who’s going to care for your child can be present. You can find plenty of free
training materials at the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Web site: www.food
allergy.org. FAAN also has specific programs on camps and colleges to
help train both you and them.
283
Chapter 17: Packing Ten Key Food Allergy Tips for Camp, College, and Other Outings

Giving Your Child a Refresher Course
Although your child’s new support network may need to get up to speed on
food allergies, your child shares responsibility for her own care and safety.
Remind your child of the following key precautions:
 Never share food or drinks.
 Read the labels, and don’t eat any unlabeled foods. 
 Ask your counselor or the cook if you’re unsure of the ingredients in a
particular food.
 Follow the rule of thumb, “If in doubt, don’t take chances with a food.”
 Seek help if you suspect the beginning of a reaction, even if you don’t
have any noticeable symptoms.
In Chapter 16, I present other key lessons to teach your child that apply to all
situations.
Choosing a Food Allergy–Friendly Camp
In many cases, your child chooses the camp he wants to attend based on one
single criteria — where his friends are going. In other cases, you, as a family,
make the choice. Whether your choice is already made for you or you’re
shopping for an appropriate camp, gather the following essential information:
 Has the camp had other campers with food allergies and how has it han-
dled these cases? (You may be able to have the camp contact parents of
children with food allergies who attended the camp and are willing to
talk with you.)
 Who’s the medical person in charge and who’s second in command (for
when the primary medical person is unavailable)? Ask about their creden-
tials and their knowledge and experience in dealing with food allergies.
 Where will your child’s epinephrine and other medications be stored
and how readily available will they be? Can your child carry her own
medications? How many people at the camp will be trained in giving the
epinephrine shots? 
 How far away is the nearest emergency medical treatment? Onsite emer-
gency care may be insufficient in a case of very severe reaction.
284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 What outings may the camper be going on during her stay? How accessi-
ble are medications and emergency treatment on these outings?
 Does the camp have a system in place to keep all camp personnel well
informed? See “Identifying One or More Point Persons,” earlier in this
chapter for details.
In most states, the camp cannot provide medicines or just keep epinephrine
on hand. Each family must provide the medications for their child. You can
never depend on others even if they are supposed to have it.
Educating Bunkmates and Roommates
Bunkmates and roommates can play a key role in intervening when a reaction
begins. Oftentimes, people with food allergies are too embarrassed or con-
fused to seek help themselves or ask if a particular food is safe. Someone
with a clearer mind who can spot the early warning signs may be better at
sounding the alarm.
Encourage your child to talk about his food allergies with bunkmates and
roommates. If a counselor is involved, perhaps she can introduce the topic of
food allergies and present a brief training session that covers prevention,
common symptoms, and emergency procedures.
Buddying Up with a Food 
Allergy Savvy Pal
Whether a child or teenager is at camp, college, or on a field trip, she typi-
cally clicks with one peer more than others. The duo may become insepara-
ble and do everything together. This person should know about your child’s
food allergy, be well-trained in spotting the early warning signs of a reaction,
and know how to respond in the event of a severe reaction. 
When our clinic works with a family to send a patient off to a new situation,
many families bring along the best friend or future roommate to get them a
special lesson on what their friend is allowed or not allowed to do. I love
these visits.
285
Chapter 17: Packing Ten Key Food Allergy Tips for Camp, College, and Other Outings

In college particularly, having a food allergy buddy to pal around with is very
helpful, especially if your friend has a tendency to wander off with the first
babe or hunk that saunters past. The friend can not only assist you in the
event of a reaction, but also help spot dangerous situations and support you
emotionally if you have to leave when the party was just starting to rock.
286
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Surviving and thriving with the buddy system
Last year, a long-time patient of mine with very
severe food allergy was preparing to go off to
college. She had multiple food allergies — milk,
egg, peanut, tree nuts, and sesame, and her
parents agonized over her safety. Her father, in
fact, referred to college as her “death sen-
tence” and had initially refused to let her go. To
make matters worse, she had been a bit of a
risk taker and had had several recent reactions.
We had many hours of discussion about the
approach to college and implemented all the
tips described in this chapter. Most important
among them, they worked with the food service
manager to determine which foods she could
eat and which eateries on campus would be
prepared for her. 
Perhaps the best move we made was to
arrange a private room for my patient and her
best friend from high school. The room included
a microwave oven, so they could cook their
own allergy-free meals, if needed. We arranged
for the friends to visit campus together the
spring before school started, and we went over
all the precautions in detail, including safe
foods, spotting reactions, administering med-
ications, and even rules that my patient’s dates
had to follow. Knowing that her best friend was
going to vigilantly police her activities, her par-
ents were able to breathe a major sigh of relief.
I am happy to say that my patient completed a
reaction-free freshman year, and all of us feel
that she has made a huge leap forward in
becoming an adult with potentially deadly food
allergy.

Substituting Foods and
Ingredients: Ten Common 
Dietary Substitutions  
In This Chapter 
 Replacing milk as an ingredient and a beverage
 Sampling wheat-free breads, cereals, and bakery items
 Discovering suitable replacements for peanut butter and tree nuts
 Substituting for butter, cheese, and eggs
C
learing the cupboards of the foods that ail you doesn’t condemn you to a
lifetime of rice cakes and distilled water. The world offers an abundance
of tasty and nutritional substitutes for the most common troublesome foods,
and the food industry is pumping out more variations each year.
In this chapter, I present you with a veritable buffet of substitutes for the
most common problem foods, including milk, eggs, wheat, and peanuts. With
the information in this chapter, you can restock your cupboards with healthy
foods and ingredients that taste good, too.
As you search for a replacement for a food, always make sure that the
replacement does not contain small amounts of that food or another food
that you are allergic to. Also be aware that many companies produce the sub-
stitute food on the same equipment as the food you are trying to avoid, such
as the soy ice cream on the real ice cream equipment or soy nut butter on the
peanut butter equipment.

Discovering Peanut and Peanut 
Butter Alternatives
Food manufacturers are beginning to get the message about the seriousness
and rising incidence of peanut allergies. Nestlé, for example, now has an
entire product line of peanut-free snacks, manufactured in a peanut-free envi-
ronment, and clearly labeled as peanut free. The SoyNut Butter Company
manufactures a peanut-free, tree-nut-free product, cleverly called Soynut-
Butter (www.soynutbutter.com). And several companies produce tree-nut
butters, including cashew and almond butter, and spreads made out of sun-
flower seeds.
You can satisfy your craving for peanuts with tree nuts, but people who are
allergic to peanuts are commonly allergic to tree nuts, as well. You don’t want
to risk triggering another allergy by pursuing a substitute, so check with your
allergist first to assess the risk. Some people find sunflower seeds or roasted
soybeans or chick peas to be a suitable substitute, and they’re less likely to
cause a reaction in those with peanut allergies.
Before trying a peanut or peanut butter substitute, read the label carefully to
make sure it doesn’t contain peanuts or other ingredients you’re sensitive to,
and always check with your allergist first. 
Replacing Milk, Ice Cream, and Yogurt 
When you’re allergic to milk, seeing celebrities and athletes with milk mus-
taches asking you if you “Got milk?” is probably not all that appealing, and it
doesn’t have to be. Although milk is packed with calcium and fortified with
vitamin D, so are a host of other beverages and foods, including rice milk, soy
milk, oat milk, potato milk, and calcium-fortified juices, cereals, and breads.
See Chapter 6 for guidance on how to obtain sufficient calcium in your diet
(and fat and protein, for infants and children). Your allergist and nutritionist
can recommend other nutritional alternatives.
Ice cream and yogurt lovers rejoice! You don’t have to give up these tasty
treats. Health food stores and specialty markets typically carry several milk-
free products to cater to customers who have milk allergy or are lactose intol-
erant. Try several products until you find one or more you like. Remember,
however, that products manufactured solely for those who are lactose-
intolerant are not safe alternatives for people with milk allergy — lactose-
free products often contain the milk protein that triggers reactions. See
Chapter 6 for details on how to spot milk on food labels.
288
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

To replace milk in recipes, substitute 1 cup of milk with 3⁄4 to 1 cup water, fruit
juice, soy milk, or rice milk. (Because substitutes are more watery than milk,
try using less of the substitute and adding 3 tablespoons of canola oil to make
up for the loss of fat.) You can pick up recipes for evaporated milk, sweet-
ened condensed milk, buttermilk, heavy cream, light cream, sour cream,
yogurt, and chocolate at the Food Allergy Kitchen (www.foodallergy
kitchen.com). When you get there, click Substitutes.
Products labeled as dairy free often contain milk. Go figure. Read the labels
carefully before trying any of these products. When in doubt, scratch the
item off your grocery list.
Discovering a Better Butter
Your grocery’s dairy section is no doubt packed with butter substitutes,
including margarine, but be careful, because many margarines contain milk
solids. If you’re looking for something to spread on your toast, consider using
olive, sesame, or canola oil and either spreading it or spraying it on your
bread. You can spice up the oil with seasonings to improve the taste. Health
food stores also carry spreads made of tahini (sesame) and sunflower seed
oil that may be suitable replacements, as long as you’re not allergic to those
seeds. 
Margarines, cooking oils, and vegetable shortening are also suitable substi-
tutes for butter in baking, assuming the products don’t contain milk solids or
other food items that trigger your reactions.
Checking Out Some Cheesy Substitutes
For cheese connoisseurs, soy- and rice-based cheese substitutes don’t quite
stack up to a slice of Swiss or a chunk of cheddar, but people who are allergic
to milk often find a suitable substitute in soy- or rice-based cheese products.
Kids who grow up eating cheese substitutes don’t even miss the “real thing,”
because they’ve never had it, and many adults quickly acquire a taste for it.
Some people love this stuff simply because they can use it to make pizzas
and macaroni and cheese. 
Not all cheese substitutes are created equal. Try several products to find the
ones you like, and try them in different recipes. Just be sure to read the
labels carefully and weed out any products that contain traces of milk.
289
Chapter 18: Substituting Foods and Ingredients: Ten Common Dietary Substitutions

For those who can’t stomach cheese substitutes, try eating something else
entirely. If you’re not allergic to sesame seeds, try spreading hummus on your
crackers and bread instead of cheese. Hummus is primarily made up of gar-
banzo beans and tahini (a sesame seed spread). Other replacements for
cheese spreads include tofu; paté; and Taramasalata — a Greek sandwich 
filling made with fish, roe, olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic.
Taramasalata often contains bread crumbs, so if you have a wheat allergy,
consider mixing up your own batch, without the bread crumbs.
Trading in Your Chocolate
True chocolate allergies are rare. If you react to chocolate, you’re more likely
intolerant of it or something else (like milk or egg) in the product may be trig-
gering the reaction. In such cases, eating a product that has pure chocolate
or cocoa, as long as it doesn’t have milk or eggs, is safe. 
Baking (also called cooking) chocolate is typically pure chocolate. Almost all
grocery stores also carry cocoa powder for baking. Cocoa is chocolate with
most of the cocoa fat removed.
If you have a chocolate intolerance, you can substitute cocoa in most recipes
with carob or carob powder. Use 11⁄2 to 2 times as much carob as cocoa. You
can also purchase carob chips to use in place of chocolate chips in cookies
and muffins.
If you have a peanut or tree nut allergy. always read the fine print on the
package to make sure the chocolate or chocolate substitute is safe — 
meaning it doesn’t contain peanuts or tree nuts. 
Whipping up a Fake Egg Mixture
When you’re allergic to eggs, you have to scrape sunny-side up and over-easy
off your breakfast menu. Commercial egg substitutes, which are usually
designed to lower cholesterol, often include egg whites, so be careful. I rec-
ommend a product called Egg Replacer from Ener-G Foods. You can learn
more about it by visiting ener-g.com or calling (800) 331-5222.
290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

When you’re baking, eggs are fairly easy to replace. Try the following 
substitutions: 
 Substitute 1⁄2 mashed banana for 1 egg in cake recipes. Bananas are a
pretty good binding agent; that is, they help the other ingredients stick
together.
 Replace each egg in the recipe with 1⁄4 cup of applesauce. Applesauce is
another good binding agent.
 Mix 1 tablespoon of gelatin or fruit pectin with 3 tablespoons of water.
(Use immediately before the mixture congeals.)
 Use 1 tablespoon of corn starch or arrowroot powder per egg along with
3 tablespoons of water to dissolve the powder. This works well for recipes
that need a little leavening.
 Mix 1⁄4 teaspoon xanthan gum with 1⁄4 cup of water and let stand for about
five minutes. You can then whip this like an egg.
When shopping for dairy-free and egg-free products, look for products labeled
“Vegan,” and check the label to confirm the absence of milk and eggs. Vegans
are strict vegetarians who avoid not only meat but also any animal products,
including milk, cheese, and eggs.
Finding a New Staple: 
Wheat-Free Breads
Bread is the staple of many a western diet, but for those who are allergic or
intolerant of wheat products, most breads spell misery. Fortunately, wheat
doesn’t have a monopoly on the bread industry. Several companies bake
breads out of rice, quinoa (pronounced “keen-wa”), amaranth, buckwheat,
potato, and other grainy, starchy stuff. Common products include the 
following:
 Rye bread or rye crackers: Some rye breads and crackers contain
wheat flour, so you may need to check with the manufacturer to make
sure the product is 100 percent rye. (Many people who have wheat aller-
gies are also allergic to rye, so rye may not be an option.)
 Gluten-free breads: Most gluten-free breads are made with a combina-
tion of rice, soy, and other types of non-wheat flours.
291
Chapter 18: Substituting Foods and Ingredients: Ten Common Dietary Substitutions

 Oat cakes: Delicatessens, health food stores, and upscale grocery stores
often carry oat cakes, but if you’re allergic to milk, make sure the oat
cakes are entirely milk-free, as well.
 Rice cakes: Most grocery stores carry rice cakes and typically shelve
them in the cereal aisle. They’re a little on the dry and crunchy side, but
a little jam or other spread can make them quite tasty.
Grocery stores often shelve their wheat-free breads and other healthy stuff in
a separate section, which is great for those of us with food allergies. If your
local grocery isn’t in tune with the times, you may have to visit a specialty
market or health food store.
Breakfasting with Wheat-Free Cereals
Wheat-based cereals rule the cereal aisle, but plenty of alternatives are also
available, including corn flakes, puffed rice or rice flakes, kasha (buckwheat),
porridge oats, rolled oats, millet flakes, or quinoa flakes. For hot cereals, try
oatmeal or brown rice cereals, grits (basically corn meal), or millet.
Some of these cereals can be a little on the dry side. Try letting the milk (or
soy or rice milk) soak in a little longer, or add more liquid or raisins, chopped
apples, or bananas to moisten it.
Before eating any cereal advertised as being made from a grain other than
wheat, check the label for any trace amounts of wheat and if you have any lin-
gering doubts, contact the manufacturer. 
Baking Your Goodies with 
Wheat-Free Flour
Because so many bakery products contain wheat, many people with wheat
allergies choose to bake their own breads. You can find a host of wheat-free
and gluten-free flours and flour mixtures at just about any health food or spe-
cialty food store, or you can make your own mixture. Here are a couple 
suggestions:
 Mix 2 parts brown rice flour 1 part soy flour and 1 part tapioca flour.
Substitute 1 cup mixture for 1 cup wheat flour. (You may need to add
more liquid to your recipe, because rice flour tends to soak up more
moisture than does wheat flour.)
292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Mix 6 parts white rice flour with 2 parts potato starch and 1 part tapioca
flour. Substitute 1 cup mixture for 1 cup wheat flour. (You may need to
add more liquid to your recipe, because rice flour tends to soak up more
moisture than does wheat flour.)
 Substitute 11⁄3 cup ground rolled oats or 11⁄8 cups oat flour for a cup of
wheat flour.
Many wheat- and gluten-free flours and mixtures include their own recipes
and instructions for using the flour as a substitute in your other recipes.
Baking powders also contain trace amounts of wheat. To make your own sub-
stitute, blend 1⁄3 cup baking soda with 2⁄3 cup cream of tartar and 2⁄3 cup potato
or arrowroot starch and store it in an airtight container. 
Discovering Safer Thickening Agents
When most chefs want to thicken their gravies, soups, and stews, they reach
for wheat flour or corn starch, but if you have a wheat or corn allergy, these
options end up on the chopping block. Fortunately several thickening agents
work nearly as well, including the following:
 Sago flour
 Tapioca
 Arrowroot
 Rice flour
 Potato flour or starch
To thicken stews, soups, and gumbos, try using okra. Okra works better as a
thickening agent if you grind it up or cook it thoroughly before adding it to
the pot.

Exploring Ten Outstanding 
Food Allergy Web Sites  
In This Chapter 
 Finding information and assistance at the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network
 Exploring food allergy resources at the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America
 Networking with fellow food allergy sufferers online and off
 Nabbing some free recipes in the Food Allergy Kitchen
I
n my humble opinion, Food Allergies For Dummies is the ultimate resource
for information and advice about food allergies. I have to admit, however,
that various Web sites provide resources I couldn’t possibly offer in this
book, including late-breaking research results made available after printing,
the ability to network with other food allergy sufferers, an opportunity to
post direct questions to specialists, and assistance in advocating for policy
changes locally and nationally.
In this chapter, I steer you toward what I consider to be the top ten food
allergy Web sites and describe the most valuable tools and features you can
expect to discover at each site.
Tapping Online Resources at FAAN: Food
Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network 
When you’re not sure where to turn for help with food allergies, few sites are
better than FAAN’s (www.foodallergy.org), where a panel of the world’s
leading experts in food allergy carefully scrutinize every piece of information
before it’s posted. Here you find plenty of information and resources pre-
sented in easily recognizable categories, including the following: Common

Food Allergens, Anaphylaxis, School & Childcare, Advocacy, Research,
Recipes, and the Daily Tip.
This site also provides links to areas specifically for teenagers and children
and to an area where teachers and school administrators can find informa-
tion on how to implement a food allergy program. The site is bilingual in
English and Spanish.
If you’re having trouble convincing your child (or an unmotivated family
member) to read this book, refer them to this Web site. It offers something
for everyone in an engaging and easily accessible format. 
Communing with the Allergy & Asthma
Network Mothers of Asthmatics 
When you want some practical information on how to care for your child, ask
a mom. This site (www.aanma.org), created and maintained by moms and
other committed individuals, lets you do just that. Once you land on the
home page, click Breatherville USA to jump to the main content area or click
En Español for the Spanish version. If you click the Breatherville USA link, the
site presents you with an interactive map you can click to visit the desired
content area. 
Click once anywhere on the interactive map to activate it. Then you can
mouse over different buildings on the map to display a pop-up box that con-
tains a description of the building. Click the building to access its offerings.
Since you’re interested in food allergies, click the Farmer’s Market to jump to
the food allergy page. Here you’ll find an online library packed with informa-
tion that covers the top food allergy topics, including the following:
 Detecting food allergies
 Symptoms of food allergy 
 Follow the food allergy clues 
 Adverse reactions to food 
 Symptoms of anaphylaxis 
 Using epinephrine 
 Living with allergies 
 Reading food labels 
296
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Don’t limit yourself to the Farmer’s Market just because it focuses on food
allergies. Visit the other buildings in Breatherville, including America’s
College of Allergy & Asthma (where you can take an online course), the
Childcare Center (for parents and care givers), City Hall (for advocacy tips),
the Pharmacy (for information on available medications), the School House
(for tips on keeping your child safe and healthy at school), and the News

Responding to a Severe Reaction:
Ten Do’s and Don’ts
In This Chapter 
 Recognizing the symptoms
 Responding ASAP with medications
 Calling 911 for backup
 Reviewing what happened to avoid recurrences
T
aking the necessary precautions to prevent allergic reactions is no guar-
antee that a reaction won’t occur. Hidden ingredients, unlabeled foods,
and cross contamination are always possible, so remain prepared at all times,
carry your medications with you, and remain at the ready to respond in a
hurry.
If you or a loved one experiences a reaction, despite your best efforts at
avoidance, what should you do? In this chapter, I provide ten do’s and don’ts
to assist you in successfully responding to a severe reaction and preventing
future recurrences.
Identify the Symptoms
Severe reactions can escalate in a hurry but may begin with more subtle
symptoms, such as an itchy mouth, panic, or an impending sense of doom.
The earlier you respond to a reaction, the better the outcome, so make sure
that you, your friends, and your family can recognize the signs and symptoms:
 Mouth: Itching or swelling of the lips, tongue, or mouth
 Throat: Itching or a sense of tightness in the throat, hoarseness, or a
hacking cough

 Skin: Hives, itching, or swelling of the face or extremities
 Gut: Nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, or diarrhea
 Lungs: Shortness of breath, repetitive coughing, or wheezing
 Heart: Lightheadedness, fainting
 Anxiety: Panic or sense of impending doom
Each reaction can present different symptoms. If your symptoms typically
consist of breaking out in hives, you have no guarantee that your next reac-
tion will begin with hives. You may experience anxiety, nausea, a tightening of
the throat, or any of the other symptoms described above.
Tell Someone Immediately
Whether you experience a reaction alone or when accompanied by others,
always tell someone else immediately. A common mistake people make, espe-
cially in social situations, is to wander off from the crowd and try to attend to
the reaction themselves. They follow their natural impulse to avoid becoming
party poopers, or in the case of teens, just look different. 
The problem with this approach is that a reaction can progress from rela-
tively subtle symptoms to a life-threatening situation in a matter of minutes.
You can faint. Your airway can become restricted to the point at which you
can’t talk.
At the first sign of a reaction, tell someone. If you’re alone, call 911, a nearby
family member, or a neighbor. If you’re on a date, tell your date. If you’re with
friends or family members, tell them. Make sure someone stays with you until
the crisis is resolved.
Remain As Calm As Possible
Feeling anxious and nervous in the midst of a severe reaction is certainly
understandable, and I’m not about to tell you Don’t Panic! I do recommend,
however, that you remain as calm as possible. When people panic, they gen-
erally make mistakes and often forget the emergency action plan they care-
fully reviewed with their doctor. 
302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

You know what you need to do at this point — take your medications, call
911, and wait for help to arrive. Sometimes taking decisive action can reduce
some of the anxiety.
Consider rehearsing your emergency action plan in preparation for a possible
future reaction. I know this may sound a little corny, but sometimes if you act
it out on your own, your body will “remember” what you need to do, even
when your brain is in panic mode.
Respond Immediately
Patients often let a reaction escalate unnecessarily because they question
their instincts. They think that some relatively minor symptoms will just go
away on their own or that calling 911 is a sign that they’ve officially become
drama queens. Because a severe reaction has the potential to become a life-
threatening reaction, however, an immediate response is critical. The faster
you can reverse the overreaction of your immune system, the better the out-
come and the faster you’ll start feeling better.
If a friend or loved one is experiencing a reaction, don’t let the person talk
you out of administering medication or calling 911. Act immediately. Err on
the side of overreacting. You can apologize later . . . if you think you need to.
Administer Medications
Medication is key to successfully thwarting a reaction, and an epinephrine
autoinjection is best. If you have an autoinjector, give yourself an injection
immediately. If an autoinjector is unavailable and you can swallow, Benedryl
is the next best option, and liquid or Fastmelt Benedryl is preferable. How
much Benedryl should you take? Consult your doctor prior to experiencing a
reaction to determine an effective, safe dose. 
Antihistamines have no life-saving properties. If you throat is swelling closed,
it will do nothing and is never a substitute for epinephrine.
303
Chapter 20: Responding to a Severe Reaction: Ten Do’s and Don’ts

Call 911
Whenever you or a loved one experiences a severe reaction, call 911 immedi-
ately after administering medication. If you don’t have medication, calling 911
immediately is even more important. When you call, be sure to provide the
dispatcher the following information:
 You’re experiencing anaphylaxis.
 You need epinephrine.
 Your current location.
If you’re the one experiencing the reaction, have someone else place the call
for you. Some doctors recommend that anyone experiencing anaphylaxis lie
down to help alleviate symptoms with low blood pressure. I don’t recom-
mend it for everyone, but if you feel faint or lightheaded, lie down.
Don’t Drive Yourself
Calling 911 and waiting for the EMTs to arrive with epinephrine and addi-
tional medical supplies and equipment is usually the best option, but if an
emergency room is nearby, having someone drive you to the emergency
room is another good option. 
Whatever you do, don’t try to drive yourself. If symptoms escalate on your
way to the hospital or emergency room, you could have a serious accident or
even a minor fender bender that could delay treatment. Ask a friend, family
member, or neighbor to drive you.
Call Your Doctor
Your doctor is not the person to call when you’re in the midst of a severe
reaction, but after you’ve obtained emergency treatment, call your doctor or
allergist and report in. Your doctor may want to see you for a follow-up, pro-
vide you with prescriptions for medication refills or new medications, and
offer advice on follow-up treatment in the hours after your initial reaction.
304
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

As soon as possible after receiving emergency treatment, call your doctor or
allergist or have someone call for you. Your doctor should be aware that
you’ve experienced a severe reaction.
Call Family or Friends
In some cases, a complete stranger may come to your assistance during a
severe reaction, in which case you end up in the emergency room with no
way home and nobody to watch over you. Call a friend or family member or
have the hospital place a call to let them know what happened and ask them
to drive you home and stay with you.
In the hours after a severe reaction, symptoms may recur. You face the great-
est risk in the four hours immediately after receiving emergency treatment,
during which time, you should remain in the emergency room under observa-
tion. Ask a responsible adult to watch over you until the risk of recurring
symptoms passes. 
Review What Happened
Figuratively speaking, you want to do a post mortem after any reaction, par-
ticularly a severe reaction, while that reaction is fresh in your mind. Jot down
the following details:
 Where you were when the reaction occurred
 What you were doing when you first experienced symptoms
 What you had eaten just prior to experiencing symptoms
 The amount of time that passed between when you ate the suspect food
and when symptoms appeared
Take your notes to your next doctor’s appointment, describe what happened,
and discuss possible adjustments to your food avoidance strategies to avoid
similar situations in the future.

O
n your journey through this book, you probably
worked up quite an appetite, and you may be 
wondering, “If this is all the stuff I can’t eat, then what 
can I eat?” 
In this part, I answer that question with a collection of 28
recipes plucked from the pages of a couple of FAAN (Food
Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network) cookbooks. I grouped
the recipes in separate appendixes so you could quickly
skip to a specific meal. Appendix A covers breakfast
items, B is for main courses, C is for snacks and cookies,
and D is for the desserts.
In Appendix E, I serve up a collection of food-allergy-
related terms and their definitions, so you can quickly
look up a definition as you’re reading the book or doing
extra research on your own.
Bon appetite!

caught in it, soak it in hot, soapy water.
Rice Krispie Treats
(EF, MF, NF, PF, SF, WF)
321
Appendix C: Snacks and Cookies
1⁄4 cup milk-free, soy-free margarine
1 package regular size milk-free, egg-free
marshmallows 
6 cups Kellogg’s Rice Krispies cereal 
1 Grease an 11-by-17-inch baking dish. 
2 Melt the margarine in a large pot over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until com-
pletely melted.

4 Pour into baking dish and flatten with the back of a spoon. Let cool before cutting into
bars. 
Tip: To make an Easter bunny; shape approximately 3 cups of the mixture into a ball to
form the body: Make a smaller ball for the head; using approximately 2 cups. Form the
remaining cup of mixture into a ball to make the tail. Roll the tail in shredded coconut to
give your Easter bunny a “cotton tail.” Attach the head and tail to the body with toothpicks.
Cut ears from pink construction paper and gently push them into the head. Cut whiskers
from black construction paper, dip the end in honey; and attach them to the face. 
WARNING: Be sure to remove the toothpicks before eating the bunny. 
Tip: Shape the mixture into an Easter basket or birthday basket to fill with treats.

Appendix E
Glossary
Adrenaline: See Epinephrine.
Allergen: Anything that triggers an allergic reaction. See also food allergen
and environmental allergen. 
Allergenic: A food that has the properties to trigger an allergic reaction.
Allergist: A doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of aller-
gies. Some allergists have more knowledge of and experience with treating
food allergies than others.
Amino acid: A basic building block for protein molecules.
Anaphylaxis: An immediate, severe, and sometimes fatal allergic reaction
that can cause respiratory failure or shock due to a severe drop in blood
pressure.
Angioedema: Swelling that typically accompanies hives and may result in
welts (particularly on the face and around the eyes), stomachache (if the sell-
ing is in the intestines), or restricted or obstructed breathing (due to swelling
in the airway).
Antibody: A good-guy protein that your body releases to attack what your
immune system perceives as a threatening intruder. Unfortunately, when you
have a food allergy, your body produces antibodies to perfectly harmless
foods.
Antihistamine: Medication that prevents the body’s release of histamine
during an allergic reaction from affecting the tissues. Antihistamines do not
stop the reaction but prevent the reaction from triggering some symptoms.
Anti-IgE antibody therapy: An allergy treatment that consists of IgG antibodies
that bind with the IgE antibodies. IgG renders the IgE powerless and unable to
trigger the massive release of histamines, which cause most symptoms. This
therapy is still in the testing phase.

Atopic: Of or relating to allergies or asthma. Atopic conditions include
asthma, hay fever, and some types of eczema.
Atopic dermatitis: Eczema that’s triggered by or made worse by an allergic
condition. See also Eczema.
Autoimmune disease: Any condition caused by the failure of the body’s
immune system to function normally. In some cases, the autoimmune system
overreacts, and in other cases, it under-reacts.
Autoinjector: A device that enables patients to inject themselves with a pre-
measured dose of medication, such as epinephrine. The two most common
autoinjectors are the EpiPen and Twinject.
Avoidance diet: A food regimen designed to assist patients in steering clear
of the foods that trigger reactions. The avoidance diet is the primary treat-
ment approach for food allergies.
Basophils: White blood cells that protect the body from invading bacteria
and viruses but that are also involved in the immune system’s response to
allergens. See also Mast cell.
Benedryl (Diphendydramine): An antihistamine that’s one of the more effec-
tive medications in treating food allergy reactions. In the event of a severe
reaction, however, Benedryl may not be effective, and epinephrine is required.
CAP-RAST: See RAST.
Complementary treatments: Any therapy that contributes to relieving symp-
toms but is not sufficient, in and of itself, to effectively treat a condition.
Corticosteroids: A steroid-based medication, such as prednisone, that can
help prevent a recurrence of symptoms in the hours following a severe reac-
tion and prevent late reactions, but that don’t work rapidly enough to pro-
vide immediate relief.
Cross contamination: A situation in which a safe food is tainted with aller-
gens from an unsafe food. Cross contamination can occur when a safe food is
manufactured on the same equipment as an unsafe food, when safe food is
prepared or served with tainted utensils, or when an unsafe food drops,
splashes, or splatters into a safe food.
Cytotoxic testing: Any of several unproven methods of diagnosing allergies
by exposing blood cells to suspected allergens and then examining the
changes in those cells under a microscope.
Double-blind test: A treatment study in which neither the researchers nor
the patients know who’s receiving treatment and who’s not until after the
study is completed. See also Open test and Single-blind test.

Part V: Appendixes: Allergy-Friendly Recipes and Other Treats 

Eczema: A persistent rash that is characterized by extreme dryness and itch-
ing of the skin and may or may not be caused by a food allergy. When food
allergy is involved, the condition is commonly referred to as atopic dermatitis. 
Entercolitis: Inflammation of the small and large intestine, commonly produc-
ing symptoms of fever, abdominal swelling, diarrhea, food malabsorption,
constipation, and abdominal pain.
Environmental allergen: Airborne particles, including dust, molds, and pol-
lens that trigger allergic reactions in some individuals.
Enzyme: A catalyst (speeder-upper) for the body’s chemical reactions. In
cases of food intolerance, you may be lacking an enzyme necessary for
digesting a particular food.
Eosinophilic esophagitis: Inflammation of the esophagus often accompanied
by pain, reflux, poor appetite, and difficulty swallowing.
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: A chronic inflammation in the GI tract, some-
times localized and sometimes involving the entire GI tract. Eosinophilic gas-
troenteritis may or may not be related to food allergy and when it is, it’s
usually not IgE-mediated. See also Eosinophilic esophagitis and IgE-mediated
food allergy.
Epinephrine: Another name for adrenaline, epinephrine is often administered
via a shot during a severe allergic reaction to quickly alleviate symptoms. 
FAHF-1: An ancient Chinese herbal formula that has proven somewhat effec-
tive in virtually curing peanut allergy in mice. 
FAHF-2: A variant of this FAHF-1 that has proven as effective in treating
peanut allergy in mice but is considered safer.
False negative: A test result that mistakenly shows that you’re not allergic to
something you really are allergic to.
False positive: A test result that mistakenly shows that you’re allergic to
something you’re really not allergic to. False positives often convince some
doctors to overly restrict a patient’s diet.
Food allergen: A substance in a food, typically a protein, that triggers the
immune system to overreact.
Food allergy: A condition that results when the body’s immune system mis-
takenly identifies a particular food as an evil invader. Not to be confused with
food intolerance.
Food challenge: An allergy test that consists of the patient consuming the
food that the patient is suspected of being allergic to. Food challenges should
331
Appendix E: Glossary

be performed only under a qualified doctor’s supervision and with emer-
gency medications and equipment readily available.
Food intolerance: An inability of the body to digest a particular food or com-
ponent of that food, typically due to the lack of an enzyme required to break
down the food.
Food poisoning: The introduction of a poisonous substance, bacteria, virus,
parasite, or other toxin into the body, often causing flu-like symptoms, includ-
ing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Irritation or inflammation of the
esophagus often caused by stomach acid backing up on the esophagus. Food
allergy plays a role in up to one-third of cases of GERD in infants and may be
the sole cause of the reflux in these cases. 
Genetically engineered immunization shots: A treatment still in the testing
phase that’s designed to re-train the immune system to function properly by
ramping up its response to disease-causing organisms and cranking down its
response to food allergens.
Gluten: The protein in wheat and other grains that commonly triggers reac-
tions in those with Celiac disease.
H2 blockers: A class of antihistamines, including Zantac (ranitidine) and
Tagament (cimetidine), that are often effective when combined with antihista-
mines in the H1 class, such as Benedryl.
Histamine: A substance that your body produces during an allergic reaction
that triggers the most symptoms, including runny nose, swelling, hives, and
rashes. Histamine swells the blood vessels and makes them highly permeable.
Histamine poisoning: A condition in which enough histamine is ingested to
produce symptoms very similar to those that appear during an allergic reac-
tion. Several foods, including strawberries, chocolate, wine, and beer, may
contain enough histamines to cause allergy-like symptoms.
Hives: See Urticaria.
Hygiene hypothesis: A theory that attributes the increasing incidence of
food allergies in more developed countries over the past 20 years to the fact
that people in developed countries are more obsessed with proper hygiene.
The theory proposes that the less the immune system is exposed to germs
and bacterial by-products the more energy it has to unleash on allergens.
Hypoallergenic: A product that’s been produced to contain as few allergens
as possible and is less likely to trigger an allergic reaction.
332
Part V: Appendixes: Allergy-Friendly Recipes and Other Treats 

IgE-mediated food allergy: A food allergy in which the immune system pro-
duces IgE antibodies that trigger symptoms. Doctors can test the levels of IgE
in your system to determine the likelihood that you’re actually allergic to a
specific food. See also Non-IgE-mediated food allergy.
Immune system: The body’s defense system against bacteria, viruses, and
anything else it identifies as an enemy invader. Unfortunately for those with
food allergies, the immune system identifies one or more foods as harmful.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE): One of your body’s antibodies that the immune
system commonly releases during its overreaction to an allergenic food.
Allergists often test for the presence of IgE in order to diagnose or rule out an
allergy to a particular substance.
Immunotherapy: Any of various treatments designed to make the immune
system more tolerant of allergens. Immunotherapy often consists of exposing
the immune system to gradually increasing doses of the allergen over time.
Lactase: The enzyme required to break down lactose (milk sugar).
Lactose intolerance: An inability to digest milk sugar that triggers symptoms
often mistakenly attributed to food allergy.
Leaky gut syndrome: A condition in which the walls of the intestines enable
undigested food particles to pass through. Leaky gut syndrome is often mis-
takenly identified as a potential cause of food allergies.
Lymphocytes: White blood cells that that are the key to the immune system’s
response to defend the body against whatever the immune system identifies
as a threat.
Mast cell: An immune system cell that releases histamine when an allergen
enters the body, resulting in the most common allergy symptoms.
Non-IgE-mediated food allergy: A food allergy in which symptoms are not
triggered by the presence of higher than normal concentrations of IgE anti-
bodies. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies typically produce symptoms that
appear more gradually and last longer, such as gastro-intestinal problems.
Open test: A treatment study in which researchers and patients know who’s
receiving treatment and who’s not. Because everyone is aware of what’s
going on, results may be influenced by the placebo effect. See also Double-
blind test and Single-blind test.
Oral allergy syndrome: A reaction restricted to the lips and mouth and is
characterized by itching (sometimes severe) and swelling (usually mild). Oral
allergy syndrome is most often caused by allergies to fresh fruits and vegeta-
bles in people with severe pollen allergies.
333
Appendix E: Glossary

Probiotics: Beneficial bacteria, such as those found in yogurt, that may opti-
mize the functioning of the immune system, improving its ability to defend
the body against harmful bacteria and viruses while decreasing its tendency
to overreact to food allergens.
Proctitis: Inflammation, itching, or soreness around the rectum which may or
may not be related to food allergy. When it is related to food allergy, it’s called
allergic proctitis.
Protein: An assemblage of amino acid chains that’s present in foods and
throughout the body. Foods that cause allergic reactions commonly contain
proteins that the immune system mistakenly identifies as dangerous.
RAST: Short for radioallergosorbent test, RAST is a blood test that helps
diagnose the presence of IgE antibodies to specific foods. RASTs can help
your doctor identify or rule out particular food allergies, but RAST results are
not always conclusive. (Sometimes referred to as called the CAP-RAST or
ImmunoCap test, which are the RASTs that have been best tested for the
diagnosis of food allergy.)
Rotation diet: A treatment approach that consists of avoiding certain foods
or food groups on a temporary basis. Rotation diets are not considered a pri-
mary treatment for people with food allergies, especially those who experi-
ence severe reactions.
Sensitization: The process by which a genetic susceptibility to an allergy
develops into an actual allergy through one or more exposures to an allergen.
Single-blind test: A treatment study in which researchers know who’s receiv-
ing treatment and who’s not, but the patients don’t. Because the researcher
may unknowingly communicate, through body language, who’s getting treat-
ment and who’s not, single-blind testing may also be influenced by the
placebo effect. See also Double-blind test and Open test.
Skin test: An allergy test in which suspected allergens are placed below the
top layer of skin to determine whether the body reacts to the substance.
Sulfite: A substance found in relatively high concentrations in some wines
and food additives, including MSG (monosodium glutamate), that can cause
chemical reactions in the body that produce symptoms very similar to those
that appear in allergic reactions.
Urticaria: Fancy name for hives — reddish raised itchy areas that form on the
skin often as the result of an allergic reaction, or a variety of other causes.
