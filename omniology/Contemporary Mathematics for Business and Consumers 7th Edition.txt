Step into the Real Business World with the Strengths of Contemporary Mathematics, 7e. Each chapter is broken into 
individual performance objectives. The text guides you to mastery of each objective by way of a carefully designed learning 
system that includes these components:
An Explanation of the topic
A Step Box clearly describing the 
solution steps
determining rate of increase or decrease
In calculating the rate of increase or decrease of something, we use the same percentage 
formula concepts as before. Rate of change means percent change; therefore, the rate is the 
unknown. Once again we use the formula R = P ÷ B. Rate of change situations contain an 
original amount of something, which either increases or decreases to a new amount.
In solving these problems, the original amount is always the base. The amount of change 
is the portion. The unknown, which describes the percent change between the two amounts, 
is the rate.
Rate of change (Rate) = Amount of change (Portion)
Original amount (Base)
StepS For Determining the rate oF inCreaSe or DeCreaSe
STEP 1. Identify the original and the new amounts and find the difference between 
them.
STEP 2. Using the rate formula R = P ÷ B, substitute the difference from Step 1 for the 
portion and the original amount for the base.
STEP 3. Solve the equation for R. Remember, your answer will be in decimal form, 
which must be converted to a percent.
ExamplE16
 
Finding the rate  
oF change
last year iberia Furniture had a work force of 360 employees. this year there are 504 
employees. What is the rate of change in the number of employees?
SolutionStrategy
The key to solving this problem is to properly identify the variables. The problem asks “what is 
the rate?”; therefore, the rate is the unknown. The original amount, 360 employees, is the base. The 
difference between the two amounts, 504 −360 = 144, is the portion. Now apply the rate formula.
R = P
B = 144
360 = .4 = 40%
40% Increase in employees

Solve the following problem for the rate of increase or decrease. round to the nearest 
tenth of a percent when necessary.
When Mike Veteramo was promoted from supervisor to manager, he received a salary increase 
from $450 to $540 per week. What was the percent change in his salary?

Review exeRcises
Solve the following increase or decrease problems for the unknown. round decimals to 
 hundredths and percents to the nearest tenth.
1. If a number increases from 320 to 440, what is the rate of increase?
Portion = Increase = 440 −320 = 120
Base = Original number = 320
    R = P
B = 120
320 = .375 = 37.5%
2. If a number decreases from 56 to 49, what is the rate of decrease?
3. What is the rate of change if the price of an item rises from $123 to $154?
4. What is the rate of change if the number of employees in a company decreases from 133 to 89?
5. 50 increased by 20% =
Rate = 100% + 20% = 120%
Base = Original number = 50
P = R × B = 1.2 × 50 = 60
6. 750 increased by 60% =

Solving Equations for the 
Unknown and Proving the 
Solution
Performance Objective 5-2, 
Page 125
To solve equations, we must move or transpose all 
the unknowns to one side and isolate all the knowns 
on the other side.
It is customary for the unknowns to be on the left 
side and the knowns to be on the right side, such as 
X = 33.
To solve for the unknown value, apply an 
inverse, or opposite, operation to both sides of the 
equation.

Solve the equation R + 7 = 12
The equation indicates addition; therefore, use the 
opposite operation: subtract 7 from both sides:
R + 7 =
12
−7 = −7

Solve the equation W −4 = 30
The equation indicates subtraction; therefore, use 
the opposite operation: add 4 to both sides:
W −4 =
30
+ 4 = + 4
W
=
34
                                                W = 34
Solve the equation 3G = 18
The equation indicates multiplication; therefore, use 
the opposite operation: divide both side by 3:
3G
3 = 18

The equation indicates division; therefore, use the 
opposite operation: multiply both sides by 5:

Order of Operations: To solve equations with 
more than one operation, transpose the terms by 
 performing the additions and subtractions first, then 
the multiplications and divisions.

To remove parentheses, multiply the coefficient by 
each term inside the parentheses.
Sign Rules: When like signs are multiplied, the 
result is positive. For example, 5(5) = 25 and 
−5(−5) = 25.
When unlike signs are multiplied, the result is 
negative. For example, 5(−5) = −25.
Solve the equation 3(4S −5) = 9
To remove the parentheses, multiply the coeffi-
cient, 3, by both terms inside the parentheses:
3(4S −5) = 9
 3(4S) −3(5) = 9
 
12S −15 = 9
   
12S = 24
S = 2

Opportunity cost is the sacrifice of  benefits 
from the next-best alternative when you 
make a financial or economic decision. To fully 
evaluate how much a checking account with 
a required minimum balance costs, calculate 
the opportunity cost.
Consider a bank that requires an average 
monthly balance of $1,500. If you can earn 
3% a year in interest on an investment main-
taining this checking account means giving 
up $45 in potential interest income.

George Bergeman
George Bergeman’s teaching career of over twenty-five years began at a small college in West 
Africa as a Peace Corps Volunteer and continued at Northern Virginia Community College, 
one of the largest multi-campus colleges in the country. Teaching awards included Faculty 
Member of the Year honors at his campus.
George is the author of numerous packages developed to provide targeted and ­effective 
­support for instruction. His first package was a statistics software/workbook combination 
published in 1985, and since then he has developed a variety of software packages to 
­support ­statistics, calculus, developmental math, and finite math including math of finance. 
MathCue.Business in conjunction with Contemporary Mathematics for Business and 
Consumers has been a focal point for George for more than sixteen years. During that time, 
he worked closely with Bob Brechner to develop and refine the package and now serves as 
coauthor for the ­seventh edition of the text.
George lives with his wife, Clarissa, near Washington, D.C. Their daughter, Jessy, recently 
completed grad school in Colorado after previously working in San Francisco, Boston, and 
Brazil. In his free time, George enjoys accompanying his wife and their young corgi, Simon, 
on walks and to training ­sessions in ­preparation for dog shows. Other hobbies include photography and videography, and these activities 
frequently intersect with dog ­training and dog shows. Along those lines, George and his wife produced a dog-sport ­training video which 
has been distributed throughout the United States and several other countries.

Remembering Robert Brechner …
The textbook you’re now reading in its seventh edition is possible due to six editions fueled 
by the creative energy and hard work of Bob Brechner. From the first, Bob had a clear idea 
of what students need and an exceedingly strong desire to carefully develop and then rework 
each and every element in this text until it could meet that need. All of Bob’s efforts were 
directed toward giving students the absolute best chance to succeed, and he wanted to col-
laborate with instructors to provide a life changing experience for students. In fact, that was 
a large part of his motivation – to have the experience of learning mathematics and busi-
ness leveraged to provide skills and confidence to meet the challenges beyond the campus 
environment.
Bob was Professor Emeritus, School of Business, at Miami-Dade College, the largest 
multi-campus community college in the country. During his 42 years at the College, he 
taught Business Math, Principles of Business, Marketing, Advertising, Public Relations, 
Management, and Personal Finance. Bob also served as Adjunct Professor at Florida Atlantic 
University, Boca Raton; International Fine Arts College, Miami; and Florida International 
University School of Journalism and Mass Communications.
Bob received a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Management from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Masters of 
Business Administration from Emory University. He also consulted widely with industrial companies and published numerous books 
covering a variety of business topics.
Beginning with the first edition of this text, I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Bob to help in this project. 
I clearly remember the call from Bob in which he outlined his vision and asked if I would develop software to complement the text. 
It was evident that Bob was tuned into the needs of both students and instructors, and I readily agreed.
Working with Bob was as fun as it was satisfying, and, with spouses included, we become great friends. As a result, our phone con-
versations managed to take many detours through photography, sports, family, friends, and the like. As enjoyable as these discussions 
were, it was a particular treat to share his pleasure in talking about instruction with faculty in person or via online webcasts.
Over the years I learned that Bob’s approach to writing and instruction was in many ways a reflection of his approach to life in 
general. In all cases he had a 100% positive attitude coupled with a go-for-it mentality that made both his writing and the way he lived 
his life remarkable.
All of those who knew Bob were not the least surprised to discover he faced cancer with strength and a consistently positive out-
look. With his wife, Shari Joy, providing support as always, he fought courageously and with exceptionally good humor for far longer 
than medical personnel had reason to expect.
Just as his approach to life and writing were intertwined, he is remembered with fondness and admiration by overlapping sets of 
friends and academic associates. In truth, it wasn’t possible to be an associate and not also be friend, and that, in itself, is a wonderful 
part of his legacy.

THE DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM: WHOLE NUMBERS
Numbers are one of the primary tools used in business. The ability to read, comprehend, and 
manipulate numbers is an essential part of the everyday activity in today’s complex business 
world. To be successful, business students should become competent and confident in dealing 
with numbers.
We will begin our study of business mathematics with whole numbers and their basic 
operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The material in this chapter is 
based on the assumption that you have a basic working knowledge of these operations. Our 
goal is to review these fundamentals and build accuracy and speed. This arithmetic review 
will set the groundwork for our study of fractions, decimals, and percentages. Most business 
math applications involve calculations using these components.
READING AND WRITING WHOLE NUMBERS 
IN NUMERICAL AND WORD FORM
The number system most widely used in the world today is known as the Hindu-Arabic 
numeral system, or decimal number system. This system is far superior to any other for 
today’s complex business calculations. It derives its name from the Latin words decimus, 
meaning 10th, and decem, meaning 10. The decimal system is based on 10s, with the starting 
point marked by a dot known as the decimal point. The decimal system uses the 10 familiar 
Hindu-Arabic symbols or digits:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
The major advantage of our decimal system over previous systems is that the position of 
a digit to the left or right of the decimal point affects its value. This enables us to write any 
number with only the 10 single-digit numbers, 0 through 9. For this reason, we have given 
names to the places or positions. In this chapter, we work with places to the left of the decimal 
point, whole numbers. The next two chapters are concerned with the places to the right of the 
decimal point, fractions, and decimals.
When whole numbers are written, a decimal point is understood to be located on the right 
of the number. For example, the number 27 is actually
27.
The decimal point is not displayed until we write a decimal number or dollars and cents, 
such as 27.25 inches or $27.25.

decimal number system A system using 
the 10 Hindu-Arabic symbols 0 through 9. In 
this place value system, the position of a digit 
to the left or right of the decimal point affects 
its value.
decimal point A dot written in a decimal 
number to indicate where the place values 
change from whole numbers to decimals.
whole numbers Any numbers 0 or greater 
that do not contain a decimal or fraction. Whole 
numbers are found to the left of the decimal 
point. Also known as an integer. For example, 6, 
25, and 300 are whole numbers.

STEPS FOR READING AND WRITING WHOLE NUMBERS
STEP 1. Beginning at the right side of the number, insert a comma after every three 
digits to mark the groups.
STEP 2. Beginning from left to right, name the digits and the groups. The units group 
and groups that have all zeros are not named.
STEP 3. When writing whole numbers in word form, the numbers from 21 to 99 are 
hyphenated, except for the decades (e.g., thirty). For example, 83 would be 
written as eighty-three.
Note:  The word and should not be used in reading or writing whole numbers. It represents 
the decimal point and will be covered in Chapter 3.
Exhibit 1-1 illustrates the first 15 places, and five groups, of the decimal number system. 
Note that our system is made up of groups of three places, separated by commas, each with 
its own name. Whole numbers start at the understood decimal point and increase in value 
from right to left. Each group contains the same three places: ones, tens, and hundreds. Note 
that each place increases by a factor of “times 10.” The group names are units, thousands, 
millions, billions, and trillions.

ROUNDING WHOLE NUMBERS TO A SPECIFIED  
PLACE VALUE
In many business applications, the use of an approximation of an exact number may be more 
desirable than using the number itself. Approximations, or rounded numbers, are easier to 
refer to and remember. For example, if a grocery store carries 9,858 items on its shelves, 
you would probably say that it carries 10,000 items. If you drive 1,593 miles, you would 
say that the trip is 1,600 miles. Another rounding application in business involves money. If 
your company has profits of $1,302,201, you might refer to this exact amount by the rounded 
number $1,300,000. Money amounts are usually rounded to the nearest cent, although they 
could also be rounded to the nearest dollar.
Rounded numbers are frequently used to estimate an answer to a problem before that 
problem is worked. Estimation approximates the exact answer. By knowing an estimate of 
an answer in advance, you will be able to catch many math errors. When using estimation to 
prework a problem, you can generally round off to the first (i.e., the leftmost) digit, which is 
called rounding all the way.
Once you have rounded to the first digit, perform the indicated math procedure. This can 
often be done quickly and will give you a ballpark or general idea of the actual answer. In the 
example below, the estimated answer of 26,000 is a good indicator of the “reasonableness” 
of the actual answer.

+ 6,000

19,549
+ 6,489
26,038
If, for example, you had mistakenly added for a total of 23,038 instead of 26,038, your 
estimate would have immediately indicated that something was wrong.

rounded numbers Numbers that are 
approximations or estimates of exact numbers. 
For example, 50 is the rounded number of the 
exact number 49.
estimate To calculate approximately the 
amount or value of something. The number 
50 is an estimate of 49.
rounding all the way A process of round-

Used to prework a problem to an estimated 
answer. For example, 2,865 rounded all the way 
is 3,000.

ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
Addition and subtraction are the most basic mathematical operations. They are used in almost 
all business calculations. In business, amounts of things or dollars are often combined or 
added to determine the total. Likewise, subtraction is frequently used to determine an amount 
of something after it has been reduced in quantity.
ADDING WHOLE NUMBERS  
AND VERIFYING YOUR ANSWERS
Addition is the mathematical process of computing sets of numbers to find their sum, or total. 
The numbers being added are known as addends, and the result or answer of the addition is 
known as the sum, total, or amount. The “+” symbol represents addition and is called the 
plus sign.

addition The mathematical process of 
 computing sets of numbers to find their 
sum, or total.
addends Any of a set of numbers being 
added in an addition problem. For example, 
4 and 1 are the addends of the addition 
 problem 4 + 1 = 5.
sum, total, or amount The result or 
answer of an addition problem. The number  
5 is the sum, or total, of 4 + 1 = 5.
plus sign The symbol “+” representing 
addition.
STEPS FOR ADDING WHOLE NUMBERS
STEP 1. Write the whole numbers in columns so that you line up the place values—
units, tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on.
STEP 2. Add the digits in each column, starting on the right with the units column.
STEP 3. When the total in a column is greater than nine, write the units digit and carry 
the tens digit to the top of the next column to the left.
SECTION II

7&3*':*/("%%*5*0/
Generally, when adding the digits in each column, we add from top to bottom. An easy and 
commonly used method of verifying your addition is to add the numbers again, but this time 
from bottom to top. By adding the digits in the reverse order, you will reduce the chance of 
making the same error twice.
For illustrative purposes, addition verification will be rewritten in reverse. In actuality, 
you do not have to rewrite the numbers; just add them from bottom to top. As mentioned 
earlier, you will achieve speed and accuracy with practice.
Once you become proficient at verifying 
addition, you can speed up your addition 
by recognizing and combining two 
numbers that add up to 10, such as 
1 + 9, 2 + 8, 6 + 4, and 5 + 5. After you 
have mastered combining two numbers, 
try combining three numbers that add up 
to 10, such as 3 + 3 + 4, 2 + 5 + 3, and 
4 + 4 + 2.

In business math, calculations are only a part of the story! Most importantly, business math 
requires the ability to (1) understand and analyze the facts of business situations, (2) determine 
what information is given and what is missing, (3) decide what strategy and procedure is 
required to solve for an answer, and (4) verify your answer. Business application word 
problems are an important part of each chapter’s subject matter. As you progress through the

SUBTRACTING WHOLE NUMBERS  
AND VERIFYING YOUR ANSWERS
Subtraction is the mathematical computation of taking away, or deducting, an amount from 
a given number. Subtraction is the opposite of addition. The original or top number is the 
minuend; the amount we are subtracting from the original number is the subtrahend; and the 
answer is the remainder, or difference. The “−” symbol represents subtraction and is called 
the minus sign.

minuend In subtraction, the original number. 
The amount from which another number, the 
subtrahend, is subtracted. For example, 5 is the 
minuend of the subtraction problem 5 − 1 = 4.
subtrahend The amount being taken or 
 subtracted from the minuend. For example,  
1 is the subtrahend of 5 − 1 = 4.
difference or remainder The number 
obtained when one number is subtracted from 
another. The answer or result of subtraction. 
For example, 4 is the difference or remainder of 
5 − 1 = 4.

Add the following numbers.
A
Because each place value increases by a 
factor of 10 as we move from right to left 
(units, tens, hundreds, etc.), when we borrow 
a digit, we can think of it as borrowing a 10.
Learning Tip
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
a.
Write the numbers in columns so that the place values are lined up. In this 
problem, they are already lined up.
Starting with the units column, subtract the digits.
Units column: 8 – 2 = 6. Enter the 6 under the units column.
Tens column: 6 – 9 can’t be subtracted, so we must borrow a digit, 10, from 
   the hundreds column of the minuend. This reduces the 9 to an 8 and gives
   us a 10 to add to the 6, making it 16.
Now we can subtract 9 from 16 to get 7. Enter the 7 under the tens column.
Hundreds column: 8 – 1 = 7. Enter the 7 under the hundreds column.
Thousands column: This column has no subtrahend, so just bring down the 4
   from the minuend to the answer line.

BUSINESS DECISION: PERSONAL BALANCE SHEET
31. A personal balance sheet is the financial picture of how much “wealth” you have accumulated as 
of a certain date. It specifically lists your assets (i.e., what you own) and your liabilities (i.e., what 
you owe). Your current net worth is the difference between the assets and the liabilities.
Net worth = Assets – Liabilities
Tom and Carol Jackson have asked for your help in preparing a personal balance sheet. They 
have listed the following assets and liabilities: current value of home, $144,000; audio/video 
equipment, $1,340; automobiles, $17,500; personal property, $4,350; computer, $3,700; mutual 
funds, $26,700; 401(k) retirement plan, $53,680; jewelry, $4,800; certificates of deposit, 
$19,300; stock investments, $24,280; furniture and other household goods, $8,600; balance on 
Wal-Mart and Sears charge accounts, $4,868; automobile loan balance, $8,840; home mortgage 
balance, $106,770; Visa and MasterCard balances, $4,211; savings account balance, $3,700; 
Carol’s night school tuition loan balance, $2,750; checking account balance, $1,385; signature

Just as with corporate statements, 
personal financial statements are 
an important indicator of your financial 
position. The balance sheet, income 
statement, and cash flow statement are 
most commonly used. When compared 
over a period of time, they tell a story of 
where you have been and where you are 
going financially.
MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
Multiplication and division are the next two mathematical procedures used with whole 
numbers. Both are found in business as often as addition and subtraction. In reality, most 
business problems involve a combination of procedures. For example, invoices, which are 
a detailed list of goods and services sold by a company, require multiplication of items by 
the price per item and then addition to reach a total. From the total, discounts are frequently 
subtracted or transportation charges are added.
MULTIPLYING WHOLE NUMBERS  
AND VERIFYING YOUR ANSWERS
Multiplication of whole numbers is actually a shortcut method for addition. Let’s see how 
this works. If a clothing store buys 12 pairs of jeans at $29 per pair, what is the total cost of 
the jeans? One way to solve this problem is to add $29 + $29 + . . . , 12 times. It’s not hard 
to see how tedious this repeated addition becomes, especially with large numbers. By using 
multiplication, we get the answer in one step: 12 × 29 = 348.
Multiplication is the combination of two whole numbers in which the number of times 
one is represented is determined by the value of the other. These two whole numbers are 
known as factors. The number being multiplied is the multiplicand, and the number by which

 The following shortcuts can be used to make multiplication easier and faster.
1. When multiplying any number times 0, the resulting product is always 0. For example,
573 × 0 = 0     0 × 34 = 0     1,254,779 × 0 = 0
2. When multiplying a number times 1, the product is that number itself. For example,
1,844 × 1 = 1,844     500 × 1 = 500     1 × 894 = 894
3. When a number is multiplied by 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and so on, simply 
attach the zeros of the multiplier to the end of that number. For example,
792 × 100 = 79,200      9,345 × 1,000 = 9,345,000
4. When the multiplier has a 0 in one or more of its middle digits, there is no need 
to write a whole line of zeros as a partial product. Simply place a 0 in the next partial 
product row directly below the 0 in the multiplier and go on to the next digit in the mul-
tiplier. The next partial product will start on the same row one place to the left of the 0 
and directly below its corresponding digit in the multiplier. For example, consider 554 
times 103.
Shortcut:
554
×   103

57,062
Long way:
554
× 103
1 662
0 00
55 4
57,062
5. When the multiplicand and/or the multiplier have zeros at the end, multiply the two 
numbers without the zeros and attach that number of zeros to the product. For example,
130 × 90 = 11,700
Note: 13 × 9 = 117, and we attach two zeros (and include a comma).
5,800 × 3,400 = 19,720,000
Note: 58 × 34 = 1,972, and we attach four zeros (and adjust the commas).
the multiplicand is multiplied is the multiplier. The answer to a multiplication problem is the 
product. Intermediate answers are called partial products.

In mathematics, the times sign—represented by the symbols “×” or “·” or “( )”—is used 
to indicate multiplication. For example, 12 times 18 can be expressed as
12 × 18     12 · 18     (12)(18)     12(18)
Note: The raised symbol · is not a decimal point.
multiplier The number by which the 
 multiplicand is multiplied. For example, 4 is the 
multiplier of 5 × 4 = 20.
product The answer or result of multiplication. 
The number 20 is the product of 5 × 4 = 20.
times sign The symbol “×” representing 
 multiplication. Also represented by a raised dot 
“·” or parentheses “( )”.
STEPS FOR MULTIPLYING WHOLE NUMBERS
STEP 1. Write the factors in columns so that the place values line up.
STEP 2. Multiply each digit of the multiplier, starting with units, times the multipli-
cand. Each will yield a partial product whose units digit appears under the 
corresponding digit of the multiplier.
STEP 3. Add the digits in each column of the partial products, starting on the right with 
the units column.

DIVIDING WHOLE NUMBERS  
AND VERIFYING YOUR ANSWERS
Just as multiplication is a shortcut for repeated addition, division is a shortcut for repeated 
subtraction. Let’s say while shopping you want to know how many $5 items you can pur-
chase with $45. You could get the answer by finding out how many times 5 can be subtracted 
from 45. You would begin by subtracting 5 from 45 to get 40, then subtracting 5 from 40 
to get 35, subtracting 5 from 35 to get 30, and so on, until you get 0. Quite tedious, but it 
does give you the answer, 9. By using division, we simply ask how many $5 are contained 
in $45. By dividing 45 by 5, we get the answer in one step (45 ÷ 5 = 9). Because division is 
the opposite of multiplication, we can verify our answer by multiplying 5 times 9 to get 45.
Division of whole numbers is the process of determining how many times one number 
is contained within another number. The number being divided is called the dividend, the 
number doing the dividing is called the divisor, and the answer is known as the quotient. 
When the divisor has only one digit, as in 100 divided by 5, it is called short division. When 
the divisor has more than one digit, as in 100 divided by 10, it is known as long division.
The “÷” symbol represents division and is known as the division sign. For example, 
12 ÷ 4 is read “12 divided by 4.” Another way to show division is
12
4
This is also read as “12 divided by 4.” To actually solve the division, we use the sign q    . 
The problem is then written as 4q12. As in addition, subtraction, and multiplication, proper 
alignment of the digits is very important.
Dividend
Divisor = Quotient           Divisor
Quotient
qDividend
When the divisor divides evenly into the dividend, it is known as even division. When 
the divisor does not divide evenly into the dividend, the answer then becomes a quotient plus 
a remainder. The remainder is the amount left over after the division is completed. This is 
known as uneven division. In this chapter, a remainder of 3, for example, will be expressed 
as R 3. In Chapter 2, remainders will be expressed as fractions, and in Chapter 3, remainders 
will be expressed as decimals.
7&3*':*/(%*7*4*0/
 To verify even division, multiply the quotient by the divisor. If the problem was worked cor-
rectly, this will yield the dividend. To verify uneven division, multiply the quotient by the 
divisor and add the remainder to the product. If the problem was worked correctly, this will 
yield the dividend.

In this word problem, we want to know how many 8-foot 
pieces of rope are contained in a 650-foot roll. The dividend 
is 650, and the divisor is 8. The quotient, 81 R 2, means that 
81 whole pieces of rope can be cut from the roll with some 
left over, but not enough for another whole piece.
Verification: 81 × 8 = 648
+   2
650
STEPS FOR DIVIDING WHOLE NUMBERS
STEP 1. Determine the first group of digits in the dividend that the divisor will divide 
into at least once. Divide and place the partial quotient over the last digit in 
that group.
STEP 2. Multiply the partial quotient by the divisor. Place it under the first group of 
digits and subtract.
STEP 3. From the dividend, bring down the next digit after the first group of digits.
STEP 4. Repeat Steps 1, 2, and 3 until all of the digits in the dividend have been 
brought down.

features. Model 800 is plug-compatible with his existing car charger and remote earbud/
microphone and will cost $140. There is a $35 mail-in rebate for the Model 800. His other 
choice is the Model 300, which is not plug-compatible with his existing accessories. The price 
of the Model 300 is $89, and it has a $20 mail-in rebate. But if he buys the Model 300, he will 
also have to buy the car charger for $30 and an earbud/microphone for $23.
a. All considered, which model would be the least expensive choice? By how much?
b. For either cell phone choice, the monthly charge will be $34 per month with a $5 rebate if 
fewer than 250 minutes are used during the month. Government fees and taxes will be $9,  
the access fee is $7, and the Internet connection charge is $15. Based on last year’s usage, 
John estimates that he will use fewer than 250 minutes in May, June, August, and October. 
If John’s service starts on January 1, how much will he spend in the next year on cellular 
phone services?

UNDERSTANDING AND WORKING WITH FRACTIONS
Fractions are a mathematical way of expressing a part of a whole thing. The word  fraction 
comes from a Latin word meaning “break.” Fractions result from breaking a unit into a 
 number of equal parts. This concept is used quite commonly in business. We may look 
at sales for 1
2 the year or reduce prices by 1
4 for a sale. A new production machine in your 
 company may be 13
4 times faster than the old one, or you might want to cut 53
4 yards of fabric 
from a roll of material.
Just like whole numbers, fractions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, and even 
combined with whole numbers. This chapter introduces you to the various types of fractions 
and shows you how they are used in the business world.
DISTINGUISHING AMONG THE VARIOUS  
TYPES OF FRACTIONS
Technically, fractions express the relationship between two numbers set up as division. The 
numerator is the number on the top of the fraction. It represents the dividend in the division. 
The denominator is the bottom number of the fraction. It represents the divisor. The numera-
tor and the denominator are separated by a horizontal or slanted line, known as the division 
line. This line means “divided by.” For example, the fraction 2/3 or 2
3, read as “two-thirds,” 
means 2 divided by 3, or 2 ÷ 3.
Numerator
Denominator
    2
3
Remember, fractions express parts of a whole unit. The unit may be dollars, feet, ounces, 
or anything else. The denominator describes how many total parts are in the unit. The numer-
ator represents how many of the total parts we are describing or referring to. For example, 
an apple pie (the whole unit) is divided into eight slices (total equal parts, denominator). As 
a fraction, the whole pie would be represented as 8
8. If five of the slices were eaten (parts 
referred to, numerator), what fraction represents the part that was eaten? The answer would be 
the fraction 5
8, read “five-eighths.” Because five slices were eaten out of a total of eight, three 
slices, or 3
8, of the pie is left.
fractions A mathematical way of expressing 
a part of a whole thing. For example, 1
4 is a 
fraction expressing one part out of a total of 
four parts.
2-1 
numerator The number on top of the division 
line of a fraction. It represents the dividend in 
the division. In the fraction 1
4, 1 is the numerator.
denominator The number on the bottom of 
the division line of a fraction. It represents the 
divisor in the division. In the fraction 1
4, 4 is the 
denominator.
division line The horizontal or slanted 
line separating the numerator from the 
denominator. The symbol representing “divided 
by” in a fraction. In the fraction 1
4, the line 
between the 1 and the 4 is the division line.

resent less than a whole unit and are known as common or proper fractions. Some examples 
of proper fractions are
3
16 three-sixteenths       1
4 one-fourth        9

When a fraction’s denominator is equal to or less than the numerator, it represents one 
whole unit or more and is known as an improper fraction. Some examples of improper frac-
tions are

number. Some examples of mixed numbers are
3 1
8 three and one-eighth       7 11
16 seven and eleven-sixteenths

common or proper fractions Fractions 
in which the numerator is less than the 
denominator. Represent less than a whole unit. 
The fraction 1
4 is a common or proper fraction.
improper fraction A fraction in which 
the denominator is equal to or less than the 
numerator. Represents one whole unit or more. 
The fraction 4
1 is an improper fraction.
mixed number A number that combines 
a whole number with a proper fraction. The 
fraction 10 1

REDUCING FRACTIONS  
TO LOWEST TERMS
Reducing a fraction means finding whole numbers, called common divisors or common 
 factors, that divide evenly into both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. For 
example, the fraction 24
48 can be reduced to 12
24 by the common divisor 2. The new fraction, 
12
24, can be further reduced to 4
8 by the common divisor 3 and to 1
2 by the common divisor 4. 
When a fraction has been reduced to the point where there are no common divisors left, other 
than 1, it is said to be reduced to lowest terms.
The largest number that is a common divisor of a fraction is known as the greatest 
 common divisor. It reduces the fraction to lowest terms in one step. In the example of 24
48 
above, we could have used 24, the greatest common divisor, to reduce the fraction to 1
2.
"3&%6$*/('3"$5*0/4#:*/41&$5*0/
Reducing fractions by inspection or observation is often a trial-and-error procedure. Sometimes 
a fraction’s common divisors are obvious; other times they are more difficult to determine. 
The following rules of divisibility may be helpful:
RULES OF DIVISIBILITY
A Number Is Divisible by
Conditions
2
If the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
3
If the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
4
If the last two digits are divisible by 4.
5
If the last digit is 0 or 5.
6
If the number is divisible by 2 and 3 or if it is even and 
the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
8
If the last three digits are divisible by 8.
9
If the sum of the digits is divisible by 9.

of having divided whole numbers, known as 
common divisors or common factors, into both 
the numerator and denominator of a fraction.

Because the last digit of the numerator is 8 and the last digit of the 
denominator is 4, they are both divisible by 2.
24
27 = 24 ÷ 3
27 ÷ 3 = 8
9
Because the sum of the digits of the numerator, 2 + 4, and the denominator, 
2 + 7, are both divisible by 3, the fraction is divisible by 3.

COMMON DIVISOR METHOD
The best method for reducing a fraction to lowest terms is to divide the numerator and the 
denominator by the greatest common divisor because this accomplishes the task in one 
step. When the greatest common divisor is not obvious to you, use the following steps to 
determine it:

a remainder of 42.

Next, divide the remainder, 42, into the previous divisor, 63. This leaves  
a remainder of 21.

Then divide the remainder, 21, into the previous divisor, 42. Because 
this leaves a remainder of 0, the last divisor, 21, is the greatest common 
divisor of the original fraction.
63 ÷ 21
231 ÷ 21     = 3
11
By dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest 
common divisor, 21, we get the fraction, 3
11, which is the original 
fraction reduced to lowest terms.

STEPS
  FOR DETERMINING THE GREATEST COMMON  
DIVISOR OF A FRACTION
STEP 1. Divide the numerator of the fraction into the denominator.
STEP 2. Examine the remainder.
r If it is 0, stop. The divisor is the greatest common divisor.
r If it is 1, stop. The fraction cannot be reduced and is therefore in lowest terms.
r If it is another number, divide the remainder into the divisor.
STEP 3. Repeat Step 2 as needed.

RAISING FRACTIONS  
TO HIGHER TERMS
Raising a fraction to higher terms is a procedure sometimes needed in addition and subtrac-
tion. It is the opposite of reducing fractions to lower terms. In reducing, we used common 
divisors; in raising fractions, we use common multiples. To raise to higher terms, simply 
multiply the numerator and denominator of a fraction by a common multiple.
For example, if we want to raise the numerator and denominator of the fraction 3
4 by factors 
of 7, multiply the numerator and the denominator by 7. This procedure raises the fraction to 21
28.
3 × 7
4 × 7 = 21
28
It is important to remember that the value of the fraction has not changed by raising it; 
we have simply divided the “whole” into more parts.
2-5
raise to higher terms The process of 
multiplying the numerator and denominator of 
a fraction by a common multiple. Sometimes 
needed in addition and subtraction of fractions. 
For example, 5
20 is the fraction 1
4 raised to higher 
terms, 20ths, by the common multiple 5.
common multiple Whole number used to 
raise a fraction to higher terms. The common 
multiple 5 raises the fraction 1
4 to 5
20.
Sometimes it is difficult to determine which 
of two fractions is the larger or smaller 
number. By converting them to like 
fractions (same denominator), the answer 
will become evident.
For example:
Which fraction is larger, 4
5 or 5

STEPS
FOR RAISING A FRACTION TO A NEW  
DENOMINATOR
STEP 1. Divide the original denominator into the new denominator. The resulting 
 quotient is the common multiple that raises the fraction.
STEP 2. Multiply the numerator and the denominator of the original fraction by the 
common multiple.

BUSINESS DECISION: EVALUATING THE QUESTION
45. You are on an academic committee tasked to evaluate state employment math test questions. The 
following question has come to the attention of the committee:
“Each of the four digits 2, 4, 6, and 9 is placed in one of the boxes to 
form a fraction. The numerator and the denominator are two-digit whole 
numbers. What is the smallest value of all the common fractions that can 
be formed? Express your answer as a reduced fraction.” 
ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF FRACTIONS
Adding and subtracting fractions occurs frequently in business. Quite often we must combine 
or subtract quantities expressed as fractions. To add or subtract fractions, the denominators 
must be the same. If they are not, we must find a common multiple, or common  denominator, 
of all the denominators in the problem. The most efficient common denominator to use is the 
least common denominator, or LCD. By using the LCD, you avoid raising fractions to terms 
higher than necessary.
DETERMINING THE LEAST COMMON DENOMINATOR 
(LCD) OF TWO OR MORE FRACTIONS
The least common denominator (LCD) is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the 
given denominators. We can often find the LCD by inspection (i.e., mentally) just by using the 
definition. For example, if we want to find the LCD of 1
4 and 1
6, we think (or write out, if we wish):
Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc.
Multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, etc.
By looking at these two lists, we see that 12 is the smallest multiple of both 4 and 6. 
Thus, 12 is the LCD.
Sometimes, especially when we have several denominators or the denominators are 
 relatively large numbers, it is easier to use prime numbers to find the LCD. A prime number
is a whole number greater than 1 that is evenly divisible only by itself and 1. Following are 
prime numbers:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and so on
common denominator A common 
multiple of all the denominators in an addition 
or subtraction of fractions problem. A common 
denominator of the fractions 1

The smallest and, therefore, most efficient

subtraction of fractions. The least common

5 is 20.
prime number A whole number greater 
than 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1. For 
example, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are prime numbers.
STEPS
  FOR DETERMINING THE LEAST COMMON DENOMINATOR  
OF TWO OR MORE FRACTIONS USING PRIME NUMBERS
STEP 1. Write all the denominators in a row.
STEP 2. Find a prime number that divides evenly into any of the denominators. Write 
that prime number to the left of the row and divide. Place all quotients and 
undivided numbers in the next row down.
STEP 3. Repeat this process until the new row contains all ones.
STEP 4. Multiply all the prime numbers on the left to get the LCD of the fractions.

nator of the LCD and subtract.
Note:  When the numerator of the fraction in the minuend is less than the numerator of 
the fraction in the subtrahend, we must borrow one whole unit from the whole 
number of the minuend. This will be in the form of the LCD/LCD and is added to 
the fraction of the minuend.
STEP 3. Subtract the whole numbers.
STEP 4. Add the difference of the whole numbers and the difference of the fractions.
Remember, when you borrow “one” in 
subtraction, you are borrowing a whole 
unit expressed in terms of the common 
denominator.
For example, 4
4, 5
5, 8
8
, 24
24
Don’t forget to add this to the existing 
fraction.

STEPS FOR MULTIPLYING FRACTIONS
STEP 1. Multiply all the numerators to form the new numerator.
STEP 2. Multiply all the denominators to form the new denominator.
STEP 3. Reduce the answer to lowest terms if necessary.
A procedure known as cancellation can serve as a useful shortcut when multiplying 
 fractions. Cancellation simplifies the numbers with which we are dealing and often leaves 
the answer in lowest terms.
cancellation When multiplying fractions, 
cancellation is the process of finding a common 
factor that divides evenly into at least one 
numerator and one denominator. The common 
factor 2 can be used to cancel

DIVIDING FRACTIONS  
AND MIXED NUMBERS
In division of fractions, it is important to identify which fraction is the dividend and which is 
the divisor. In whole numbers, we found that a problem such as 12 ÷ 5 is read “12 divided 
by 5.” Therefore, the 12 is the dividend and the 5 is the divisor. Fractions work in the same 
way. The number after the “÷” sign is the divisor. In the problem 3
4 ÷ 2
3, for example, 3
4 is the 
dividend and 2
3 is the divisor.
Dividend ÷ Divisor = Dividend
Divisor = DivisorqDividend
Division of fractions requires that we invert the divisor. To invert means to turn upside 
down. By inverting a fraction, the numerator becomes the denominator and the denomina-
tor becomes the numerator. For example, the fraction 5
12 becomes 12
5  when inverted. These 
fractions are also known as reciprocals. Therefore, 5
12 and 12
5  are reciprocals of each other.
As in multiplication, division requires that mixed numbers be converted to improper fractions.
2-10
invert To turn upside down. For example, 1
4 
inverted becomes 4
1. In division of fractions, the 
divisor is inverted.
reciprocals Numbers whose product is 1. 
Inverted numbers are also known as reciprocals 
of each other. The fractions 1
4 and 4
1 are 
reciprocals because 1
4 × 4
1 = 1.
invert To turn upside down For example 1
The number after the “ ÷ ” sign is the divisor.
This is the number that gets inverted 
when dividing.

Marketing Research Market and survey 
researchers gather information about 
what people think. They help companies 
understand what types of products and 
services people want and at what price. By 
gathering statistical data on competitors 
and examining prices, sales, and methods 
of marketing and distribution, they advise 
companies on the most efficient ways of 
marketing their products.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, overall employment of market 
and survey researchers is projected to grow 
28 percent from 2008 to 2018. Median 
annual salaries for market research analysts 
in 2012 was $56,000.

Reducing a fraction means finding whole numbers, 
called common divisors or common factors, that divide 
evenly into both the numerator and denominator of the 
fraction.
When a fraction has been reduced to the point where 
there are no common divisors left other than 1, it is said 
to be reduced to lowest terms.

denominator.
2. Examine the remainder.
r If it is 0, stop. The divisor is the greatest common 
divisor.

UNDERSTANDING DECIMAL NUMBERS
In Chapter 1, we learned that the position of the digits in our number system affects their 
value. In whole numbers, we dealt with the positions, or places, to the left of the decimal 
point. In decimal numbers, we deal with the places to the right of the decimal point. These 
places express values that are less than whole numbers.
As with fractions, decimals are a way of expressing parts of a whole thing. Decimals are 
used extensively in business applications. In this chapter, you will learn to read, write, and 
work problems involving all types of decimal numbers.
READING AND WRITING DECIMAL NUMBERS 
IN NUMERICAL AND WORD FORM
By definition, decimal numbers, or decimals, are amounts less than whole, or less than one. 
They are preceded by a dot known as the decimal point and are written .31 or 0.31, for 
example. The zero is used to ensure that the decimal point is not missed. Often decimals are 
written in conjunction with whole numbers. These are known as mixed decimals. In mixed 
decimals, the decimal point separates the whole numbers from the decimal, such as 4.31.
The place value chart shown in Exhibit 3-1 expands the whole number chart from 
Chapter 1 to include the places representing decimals. In decimals, the value of each place 
starting at the decimal point and moving from left to right decreases by a factor of 10. The 
names of the places on the decimal side end in ths; they are tenths, hundredths, thousandths, 
ten-thousandths, hundred-thousandths, millionths, and so on.
To read or write decimal numbers in words, you must read or write the decimal part as if 
it were a whole number, then name the place value of the last digit on the right. For example, 
.0594 would be read as “five hundred ninety-four ten-thousandths.”
In reading and writing mixed decimals, the decimal point should be read as “and.” For 
example, 81.205 would be read as “eighty-one and two hundred five-thousandths.” If the 
decimal numbers, or decimals Amounts 
less than whole, or less than one. For example, 
.44 is a decimal number.
decimal point A dot written in a decimal 
number to indicate where the place values 
change from whole numbers to decimal 
numbers.
mixed decimals Decimals written in 
conjunction with whole numbers. For 
example, 2.44 is a mixed decimal.
SECTION I

Learning Tip
When reading numbers, remember that 
decimals start with the tenths place as we 
move left to right starting from the decimal 
point, whereas whole numbers start with 
the ones place as we move right to left 
starting from the decimal point. 
Also, don’t forget that the word “and” is 
used to represent the decimal point.
Margin of Victory Decimals are used 
in all forms of racing to express the time 
differences among the competitors. The 
closest NASCAR finish to date occurred 
at the Darlington Raceway in 2003 when 
Ricky Craven finished ahead of Kurt Bush 
by a mere 0.002 of a second in the Carolina 
Dodge Dealers 400.

When a dollar sign ($) precedes a number, the whole number value represents dollars and 
the decimal value represents cents. The decimal point is read as “and.” For example, $146.79 
would be read as “one hundred forty-six dollars and seventy-nine cents.”

Strategy: In this example, write the number eighteen. Because the last 
digit, 8, is in the hundredths place, the decimal would be written:
Eighteen hundredths
b.  .0391
Strategy: Write the number three hundred ninety-one. The last digit, 1, is 
in the ten-thousandths place; therefore, the decimal would be written:
Three hundred ninety-one ten-thousandths
c.  .00127
Strategy: Write the number one hundred twenty-seven. The last digit, 7, is 
in the hundred-thousandths place; therefore, the decimal would be written:
One hundred twenty-seven hundred-thousandths
d.  34.892
Strategy: This example is a mixed decimal. First, write the whole number: 
thirty-four. The decimal point is represented by the word and. Now write 
the decimal part as the number eight hundred ninety-two. The last digit, 2, 
is in the thousandths place; therefore, the mixed decimal is written:
Thirty-four and eight hundred ninety-two thousandths
e.  1,299.008
Strategy: This example is also a mixed decimal. Start by writing the 
whole number: one thousand, two hundred ninety-nine. Write and for the 
decimal point and write the number eight. Because the last digit, 8, is in 
the thousandths place, the mixed decimal is written:
One thousand, two hundred ninety-nine and eight thousandths

STEPS TO ROUND DECIMALS TO A SPECIFIED PLACE VALUE
STEP 1. 
Determine the place to which the decimal is to be rounded.
STEP 2a. If the digit to the right of the one being rounded is 5 or more, increase the 
digit in the place being rounded by 1.
STEP 2b. If the digit to the right of the one being rounded is 4 or less, do not change 
the digit in the place being rounded.
45&1
Delete all digits to the right of the digit being rounded.
In business, decimals are frequently used in 
writing large numbers.

Strategy: This decimal has a fraction at the end. Start by writing 
the number three hundred twenty-eight. Write and; then write the 
fraction, two-thirds. Because the last digit of the decimal, 8, is in the 
thousandths place, it is written:
Three hundred twenty-eight and two-thirds thousandths
g.   Three hundred 
seventy-two 
 ten-thousandths
Strategy: Write three hundred seventy-two in numerical form. Place 
the last digit, 2, in the ten-thousandths place. Because ten thousand 
has four zeros, this is four places to the right of the decimal point. 
Note that we have to add a zero in the tenths place for the last digit, 
2, to be in the ten-thousandths place.
.0372
h. Sixteen  thousand 
and forty-one 
 hundredths
Strategy: Write the whole number sixteen thousand. Place the 
decimal point for the word and. Write the number forty-one and 
place the last digit, 1, in the hundredths place. Note that hundred has 
two zeros; therefore, the hundredths place is two places to the right 
of the decimal point.

fraction one-half after it. Write the last digit, 3, in the thousandths 
place, three places to the right of the decimal point. Note that we 
have to add a zero in the tenths place for the last digit, 3, to be in the 
thousandths place.

ROUNDING DECIMAL NUMBERS TO A SPECIFIED PLACE VALUE
Rounding decimals is important in business because numbers frequently contain more  decimal 
places than necessary. For monetary amounts, we round to the nearest cent, or hundredth place. 
For other business applications, we usually do not go beyond thousandths as a final answer.

REVIEW EXERCISES
Write the following numbers in word form.
Most business calculators, such as the Texas 
Instruments BA II Plus, store numeric values 
internally to an accuracy of 13 digits, but you 
can specify the number of decimal places you 
want to display. When using the “floating-
decimal” option, the calculator displays up to 
10 digits.
Changing the number of decimal places 
affects the display only. Except for certain 
business applications such as amortization 
and depreciation results, the calculator does 
not round internal values. To round the 
internal value, you must use the “round” 
function.

DECIMAL NUMBERS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES
In business, working with decimals is an everyday occurrence. As you will see, performing 
the fundamental processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on decimal 
numbers is very much like performing them on whole numbers. As before, the alignment 
of the numbers is very important. The difference is in the handling and placement of the 
decimal point.
SECTION II 3
STEPS FOR ADDING AND SUBTRACTING DECIMALS
STEP 1. Line up all the decimal points vertically.
STEP 2. (Optional) Add zeros to the right of the decimal numbers that do not have 
enough places.
45&1 Perform the addition or subtraction, working from right to left.
STEP 4. Place the decimal point in the answer in the same position (column) as in the

Did you know the Romans called the total 
of addition problems res summa, the highest 
thing. Later this was shortened to summa, 
which is why we call addition answers sums.
When adding, the Romans always added a 
column of numbers starting from the bottom, 
putting the total at the top! This explains why 
we still say “to add up.”

ADDING AND SUBTRACTING DECIMALS
In adding and subtracting decimals, we follow the same procedure as we did with whole 
numbers. As before, be sure that you line up all the place values, including the decimal points.

MULTIPLYING DECIMALS
Decimals are multiplied in the same way as whole numbers except we must now deal with 
placing the decimal point in the answer. The rule is that there must be as many decimal places 
in the product as there are total decimal places in the two factors, the multiplier and the mul-
tiplicand. This may require adding zeros to the product.
3-4
STEPS FOR MULTIPLYING DECIMALS
STEP 1. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Disregard the decimal 
points.
STEP 2. Total the number of decimal places in the two factors, the multiplier and the 
multiplicand.
45&1 Insert the decimal point in the product, giving it the same number of decimal 
places as the total from Step 2.
STEP 4. If necessary, place zeros to the left of the product to provide the correct num-
ber of digits.

Multiplication Shortcut
Whenever you are multiplying a decimal by a power of 10, such as 10, 100, 1,000, or 10,000, 
count the number of zeros in the multiplier and move the decimal point in the multiplicand the 
same number of places to the right. If necessary, add zeros to the product to provide the required 
places.

DIVIDING DECIMALS
In division of decimals, be aware of the decimal points. The basic rule is that you cannot 
divide with a decimal in the divisor. If there is a decimal, you must convert it to a whole 
number before dividing.
3-5
STEPS
  FOR DIVIDING DECIMALS IF THE DIVISOR  
IS A WHOLE NUMBER
STEP 1. Place the decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal point in the 
dividend.
STEP 2. Divide the numbers. Zeros may be added to the right of the dividend as needed.
When adding, subtracting, multiplying, or 
dividing decimals, numbers should not be 
rounded until the final answer—unless you 
are estimating.
If the situation involves money, final answers 
should be rounded to the nearest cent.
Learning Tip
STEPS
  FOR DIVIDING DECIMALS IF THE DIVISOR  
IS A DECIMAL NUMBER
STEP 1. Move the decimal point in the divisor to the right until it becomes a whole 
number.
STEP 2. Move the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places as you 
moved it in the divisor. It may be necessary to add zeros to the right of the 
dividend if there are not enough places.
45&1 Place the decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal point in the 
dividend.
STEP 4. Divide the numbers.
Note:  All answers involving money should be rounded to the nearest cent. This means 
dividing until the quotient has a thousandths place and then rounding back to 
hundredths. For example, $45.671 = $45.67 and $102.879 = $102.88.

The federal government reimburses school districts $2.68 for each free lunch, $2.28  
for each reduced-price lunch, and $0.25 for each paid lunch. In addition to cash reimbursements, 
schools are entitled to receive USDA foods called “entitlement” foods at a value of 19.50 cents 
for each lunch served.

CONVERSION OF DECIMALS TO FRACTIONS  
AND FRACTIONS TO DECIMALS
Changing a number from decimal form to its fractional equivalent or changing a number in 
fractional form to its decimal equivalent is common in the business world. For example, a 
builder or an architect may use fractions when dealing with the measurements of a project but 
convert to decimals when calculating the cost of materials.
SECTION  III 3
CONVERTING DECIMALS TO FRACTIONS
Keep in mind that decimals are another way of writing fractions whose denominators are 
powers of 10 (10, 100, 1,000…). When you are converting a mixed decimal, the whole num-
ber is added to the new fraction, resulting in a mixed fraction.
3-6 
STEPS 
FOR CONVERTING DECIMALS TO THEIR FRACTIONAL 
EQUIVALENT
STEP 1. Write the numerator of the fraction as the decimal number, without the  decimal 
point.
STEP 2. Write the denominator as 1 followed by as many zeros as there are decimal 
places in the original decimal number.
45&1 Reduce the fraction to lowest terms.

CONVERTING FRACTIONS TO DECIMALS
In Chapter 2, we learned that fractions are actually a way of expressing division, with the line 
separating the numerator and the denominator representing “divided by.”
Numerator (dividend)
Denominator (divisor) = Denominator qNumerator
In business, decimal numbers are usually rounded to three places (thousandths) or less. 
When expressing money, round to the nearest hundredth, or cent.
EXAMPLE6 
$0/7&35*/(%&$*."-4
50'3"$5*0/4
Convert the following numbers to their reduced fractional equivalent.
a. .64
b. .125
c. .0457
d. 17.31
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
a. .64 = 64
100 = 16
25
In this example, 64 becomes the numerator. Because there 
are two decimal places, the denominator is 1 with two zeros. 
Then reduce the fraction.
b. .125 = 125
1,000 = 1
8
Once again, the decimal becomes the numerator, 125. This 
decimal has three places; therefore, the denominator will 
be 1 followed by three zeros. The resulting fraction is then 
reduced to lowest terms.
c. .0457 =
457
10,000
This fraction does not reduce.
d. 17.31 = 17 + 31
100 = 17 31
100
This mixed decimal results in a mixed fraction. It cannot be 
reduced.
TRYITEXERCISE 6
Convert the following decimals to their fractional equivalent, reducing where possible.
a. .875

c. .0004
d. 84.75
C H E C K  Y O U R  A N S W E R S  W I T H  T H E  S O L U T I O N S  O N  P A G E  8 4 .
3-7 
STEPS FOR CONVERTING FRACTIONS TO DECIMALS
STEP 1. Divide the numerator by the denominator.
STEP 2. Add a decimal point and zeros, as necessary, to the numerator (dividend).
When converting decimals to fractions, 
 verbally say the decimal and then write 
down what you said as a fraction. For 
example:
t .85 would be verbally stated as 
“eighty-five hundredths” and  written  
as 85
100
.
t .655 would be verbally stated as “six 
 hundred fifty-five thousandths” and 
 written as 655
1,000
.

5 = 5q3.0
In this example, the numerator, 3, becomes the dividend, 
with a decimal point and zero added. The denominator, 5, 
becomes the divisor.
b. 
              .3333 = .33
1
3 = 3q1.0000
In this example, the division is uneven and goes on and on; 
so we round the quotient to hundredths.
c.                 2.55555 = 2.56
23
9 = 9q23.00000
Improper fractions result in mixed decimals. Note that the 
quotient was rounded because of an endlessly repeating 
decimal.
d.                              .375 = 15.38

Pizza, Pizza! According to industry 
sources, each man, woman, and child in 
America eats an average of 46 slices (23 
pounds) of pizza per year. The equivalent 
of 100 acres of pizza is  consumed daily, or 
about 350 slices per second.

c. Your bank offers the Bradys a 30-year mortgage with a rate of 5 percent. At that rate, the 
monthly payments for principal and interest on the loan will be $5.37 for every $1,000 
financed. What is the amount of the principal and interest portion of the Bradys’ monthly 
payment?
d. What is the total amount of interest that will be paid over the life of the loan?
e. Your bank also requires that the monthly mortgage payments include property tax and home-
owners insurance payments. If the property tax is $1,710 per year and the  property insurance 
is $1,458 per year, what is the total monthly payment for PITI (principal,  interest, taxes, and 
insurance)?
f. To qualify for the loan, bank rules state that mortgage payments cannot exceed 1
4 of the com-
bined monthly income of the family. If the Bradys earn $3,750 per month, will they qualify 
for this loan?

In decimals, the value of each place starting at 
the decimal point and moving from left to right 
decreases by a factor of 10. The names of the 
places end in ths; they are tenths, hundredths, 
thousandths, ten-thousandths, hundred-thousandths, 
millionths, and so on.
1. To write decimal numbers in words, write the 
decimal part as a whole number; then add the 
place value of the last digit on the right.
2. When writing mixed decimals, the decimal 
point should be read as “and.”
3. If the decimal ends in a fraction, read them 
together using the place value of the last digit 
of the decimal.
4. When a dollar sign ($) precedes a number, the 
whole number value represents dollars, the 
decimal value represents cents, and the decimal 
point is read as “and.”

Blu-ray, the New Ray! Blu-ray format 
offers more than five times the storage 
capacity of traditional DVDs and can hold 
up to 25GB on a single-layer disc and 
50GB on a dual-layer disc. While optical 
disc technologies such as DVD rely on a 
red laser to read and write data, the new 
format uses a blue-violet laser instead, 
hence the name Blu-ray.

BUSINESS DECISION: THE  
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRIP
41.  U.S. dollars are legal currency only in the United States. International investment, travel, and 
trade require that dollars be exchanged for foreign currency. In today’s global economy, a float-
ing exchange rate system is used to value major currencies compared to each other. Because the 
values of these currencies vary continually, exchange rate tables are published daily by numer-
ous business sources. The information below is taken from one such exchange-rate table.

STEPS TO CONVERT BETWEEN FOREIGN CURRENCIES
STEP 1. Locate the currency exchange rate at the intersection of the column of the cur-
rency you are changing from (old currency) and the row of the currency you 
are changing to (new currency).
STEP 2. Multiply the number of units you are changing from (old currency) by the 
currency exchange rate.
New currency = Old currency × Currency exchange rate
Up-to-the-minute currency exchange rates 
can be found at www.xe.com.

UNDERSTANDING AND USING CHECKING ACCOUNTS
Checking accounts are among the most useful and common banking services available today. 
They provide a detailed record of monetary transactions and are used by most businesses 
and individuals to purchase goods and services and to pay bills. When a checking account 
is opened, banks often require an initial minimum deposit of $50 or $100. Certain types of 
accounts require a minimum average monthly balance in the account. If the balance falls below 
the minimum, the bank may charge a fee.
Checking account transactions are processed in our banking system using a combination 
of paper checks and electronic options such as automated teller machines (ATMs), debit 
cards, automatic bill paying, and electronic funds transfer (EFT). Online banking uses today’s 
technology to give account holders the option of bypassing some of the time-consuming 
paper-based aspects of traditional banking (Exhibit 4-1), Online banking has increased in 
popularity in recent years as it is a green-friendly, convenient alternative to paper-based 
methods of banking.
Several features are designed to make mobile banking secure. These include view-
ing accounts by name rather than account number and using encryption to mask sensitive 
information.
OPENING A CHECKING ACCOUNT AND UNDERSTANDING 
HOW VARIOUS FORMS ARE USED
After you have chosen a bank, the account is usually opened by a new accounts officer or 
a clerk. After the initial paperwork has been completed, the customer places an amount of 
money in the account as an opening balance. Funds added to a checking account are known 
as deposits. The bank will then give the depositor a checkbook containing checks and deposit 
slips.
A check, or draft, is a negotiable instrument ordering the bank to pay money from the 
checking account to the name written on the check. The person or business named on the check 
to receive the money is known as the payee. The person or business issuing the check is known 
as the payor.
 4-1 
deposits Funds added to a checking account.
depositor A person who deposits money in a 
checking account.
check, or draft A written order to a bank by 
a depositor to pay the amount specified on 
the check from funds on deposit in a checking 
account.
payee The person or business named on the 
check to receive the money.
payor The person or business issuing the 
check.
The percentage of internet users who 
banked online was 12% in 1998. Just 
seven years later it reached 44%, and it 
continues to rise rapidly each year. (Pew

Checks are available in many sizes, colors, and designs; however, they all contain the 
same fundamental elements. Exhibit 4-2 shows a check with the major parts labeled. Look at 
the illustration carefully and familiarize yourself with the various parts of the check.
Deposit slips, or deposit tickets, are printed forms with the depositor’s name, address, 
account number, and space for the details of the deposit. Deposit slips are used to record 
money, both cash and checks, being added to the checking account. They are presented to 
the bank teller along with the items to be deposited. When a deposit is completed, the deposi-
tor receives a copy of the deposit slip as a receipt, or proof of the transaction. The deposit 
should also be recorded by the depositor on the current check stub or in the check register. 
Exhibit 4-3 is an example of a deposit slip.
Either check stubs or a check register can be used to keep track of the checks written, the 
deposits added, and the current account balance. It is very important to keep these records 
accurate and up to date. This will prevent the embarrassing error of writing checks with insuf-
ficient funds in the account.
Check stubs, with checks attached by perforation, are usually a bound part of the check-
book. A sample check stub with a check is shown in Exhibit 4-4. Note that the check number 
is preprinted on both the check and the attached stub. Each stub is used to record the issuing 
of its corresponding check and any deposits made on that date.
Check registers are the alternative method for keeping track of checking account activity. 
They are a separate booklet of forms rather than stubs attached to each check. A sample check 
register is shown in Exhibit 4-5. Note that space is provided for all the pertinent information 
required to keep an accurate and up-to-date running balance of the account.
deposit slips Printed forms with the 
 depositor’s name, address, account number, 
and space for the details of the deposit. Used 
to record money, both cash and checks, being 
added to the checking account.
check stubs A bound part of the checkbook 
attached by perforation to checks. Used to keep 
track of the checks written, deposits, and current 
account balance of a checking account.
check register A separate booklet of blank 
forms used to keep track of all checking account 
activity. An alternative to the check stub.

WRITING CHECKS IN PROPER FORM
When a checking account is opened, you will choose the color and style of your checks. The 
bank will then order custom-printed checks with your name, address, and account number 
identifications. The bank will provide you with some blank checks and deposit slips to use 
until your printed ones arrive.
Checks should be typed or neatly written in ink. There are six parts to be filled in when 
writing a check.

STEPS FOR WRITING CHECKS IN PROPER FORM
STEP 1.
Enter the date of the check in the space provided.
STEP 2.
Enter the name of the person or business to whom the check is written, the 
payee, in the space labeled pay to the order of.
STEP 3.
Enter the amount of the check in numerical form in the space with the dollar 
sign, $. The dollar amount should be written close to the $ so that additional 
digits cannot be added. The cents may be written as xx/100 or .xx.
STEP 4.
Enter the amount of the check, this time written in word form, on the next line 
down, labeled dollars. As before, the cents should be written as xx/100 or .xx. 
A horizontal line is then drawn to the end of the line.
STEP 5.
The space labeled for is used to write the purpose of the check. Although this 
step is optional, it’s a good idea to use this space so you will not forget why 
the check was written.
STEP 6.
The space in the lower right-hand portion of the check is for the signature.

ENDORSING CHECKS BY USING BLANK, 
RESTRICTIVE, AND FULL ENDORSEMENTS
When you receive a check, you may cash it, deposit it in your account, or transfer it to 
another party. The endorsement on the back of the check instructs the bank on what to do. 
Federal regulations require that specific areas of the reverse side of checks be designated for 
the payee and bank endorsements. Your endorsement should be written within the 11
2-inch 
space at the trailing edge of the check, as shown in Exhibit 4-6. The space is usually labeled 
“ENDORSE HERE.”
There are three types of endorsements with which you should become familiar: blank 
endorsements, restrictive endorsements, and full endorsements, which are shown in 
Exhibits 4-7, 4-8, and 4-9, respectively.
 4-3

Learning Tip
New Federal Debit Card – The U.S. 
Treasury now provides a debit card that 
people without traditional bank accounts 
can use to access federal benefits such as 
Social Security and disability payments.
Federal payments are credited to the 
cards each month, enabling users to make 
free withdrawals from ATMs in the govern-
ment’s Direct Express network.

A blank endorsement is used when you want to cash the check. You, as the payee, simply 
sign your name exactly as it appears on the front of the check and write your account number. 
Once you have endorsed a check in this manner, anyone who has possession of the check can 
cash it. For this reason, you should use blank endorsements cautiously.
A restrictive endorsement is used when you want to deposit the check in your account. 
In this case, you endorse the check “for deposit only,” sign your name as it appears on the 
front, and write your account number.
A full endorsement is used when you want to transfer the check to another party. In this 
case, you endorse the check “pay to the order of,” write the name of the person or business to 
whom the check is being transferred, sign your name, and write your account number.

USING CHECK STUBS OR CHECKBOOK REGISTERS
TO RECORD ACCOUNT TRANSACTIONS
In Performance Objective 4-1, we learned that some people use check stubs to keep records 
and some use check registers. Exhibit 4-11 shows a check and its corresponding stub properly 
filled out. Note that the check number is printed on the stub. The stub is used to record the 
amount of the check, the date, the payee, and the purpose of the check. In addition, the stub 
also records the balance forwarded from the last stub, deposits made since the previous check, 
and the new balance of the account after the current check and any other charges are deducted.

It’s Your Money
It is important to keep accurate checkbook 
records and reconcile the account  balance 
each month. Banks can and do make 
mistakes!
Inaccurate record keeping on the part of the 
account holder can cause embarrassment due 
to incorrect balances, as well as service charges 
for bounced checks.

Check registers record the same information as the stub but in a different format. 
Exhibit 4-12 shows a check register properly filled out. The starting balance is located in 
the upper right-hand corner. In keeping a check register, it is your option to write it single 
spaced or double spaced. Remember, in reality, you would use either the check stub or the 
checkbook register.

A new rule issued by the Federal Reserve 
 prohibits banks from charging overdraft 
fees on ATM and debit card transactions 
unless customers “opt-in” to a protection pro-
gram. If customers don’t “opt in” to a protec-
tion program, any debit or ATM transactions 
that overdraw their accounts will be denied.
The rule responds to complaints that 
overdraft fees for debit cards and ATMs 
are unfair because many people assume 
they can’t spend more than that is in their 
account. Instead, many banks allow the 
transactions to go through and then charge 
overdraft fees of up to $35.
Source: The Miami Herald, “Customer consent will be a 
must for overdraft fees,” by Christopher S. Rugaber, Nov. 13, 
2009, page 3C.

Safe-deposit boxes are a type of safe 
usually located inside a bank vault or in the 
back of a bank or post office. These boxes are 
typically used to store things such as  
valuable gemstones, precious metals, 
currency, or important documents. In the 
typical arrangement, a renter pays the bank 
a fee for the use of the box, which can be 
opened only with the assigned key, the 
bank’s key, the proper signature, or perhaps a 
code of some sort.
The contents of the safe-deposit boxes  
are not insured unless you cover them in  
your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance 
policy.
A “cyber backup” is a good way to  
protect your important documents. Banks 
and online vendors offer “virtual safe-deposit 
boxes,” where digital copies of documents 
can be stored.

BUSINESS DECISION: TELLER TRAINING
11. You are the training director for tellers at a large local bank. As part of a new training program 
that you are developing, you have decided to give teller trainees a “sample” deposit slip, check, 
and check register with common errors on them. The trainees must find and correct the errors. 
Your task is to create the three documents.
a. On a separate sheet of paper, list some “typical errors” that bank customers might make on a 
deposit slip, a check, and a check register.
b. Use the following blank deposit slip, check, and check register to create “filled-out” 
versions, each with one error you named for that document in part a. You make up all the 
details: names, dates, numbers, etc.
c. After completing part b, exchange documents with another student in the class and  
try to find and correct the errors. (If this is a homework assignment, bring a copy of 
each  document you created to class for the exchange. If this is an in-class assignment, 
temporarily trade documents with the other student after completing part b.)

Bank Teller According to the U.S. Department 
of Labor, bank tellers make up 28% of bank 
employees and conduct most of a bank’s rou-
tine transactions.
In hiring tellers, banks seek people who 
enjoy public contact and have good numerical, 
clerical, and communication skills. Banks prefer 
applicants who have had courses in mathemat-
ics,  accounting, bookkeeping, economics, and 
public speaking.

BANK STATEMENT RECONCILIATION
Your monthly bank statement gives you a detailed review of the activity in your account 
for a specific period of time. It’s your best opportunity to make sure your records match the 
bank’s records. Be prepared to “match up” every activity (credits and debits) on the statement 
with your checkbook.
It is important that you review the bank statement in a timely fashion. If you find any dis-
crepancies in ATM, debit card, or other electronic transactions, you must report them to the 
bank within 60 days of the date of the statement or the bank has no obligation to conduct an 
investigation. Another important reason to reconcile your checkbook with the statement is to 
look for debits you didn’t make that might indicate that someone has access to your account.
UNDERSTANDING THE BANK STATEMENT
Bank statements vary widely in style from bank to bank; however, most contain essentially 
the same information. Exhibit 4-13 illustrates typical online and printed bank statements. 
Note that it shows the balance brought forward from the last statement, the deposits and cred-
its that have been added to the account during the month, the checks and debits that have been 
subtracted from the account during the month, any service charges assessed to the account, 
and the current or ending balance.
Credits are additions to the account, such as interest earned, notes collected, and electronic 
funds transfers of direct deposit payroll checks. Debits are subtractions from the account, 
such as ATM withdrawals, debit card transactions, monthly service charges, check printing 
charges, nonsufficient fund (NSF) fees, and returned items. A nonsufficient fund (NSF) fee is 
a fee charged by the bank when a check is written without sufficient funds in the account to 
cover the amount of that check. Returned items are checks from others that you deposited in 
your account but were returned to your bank unpaid because the person or business issuing 
the check had insufficient funds in its account to cover the check. Banks usually charge a 
returned item fee when this occurs.

the activities in a checking account,  including

PREPARING A BANK STATEMENT RECONCILIATION
When the statement arrives from the bank each month, the depositor must compare the bank 
balance with the balance shown in the checkbook. Usually, the balances are not the same 
because during the month, some account activity has taken place without being recorded by the 
bank and other activities have occurred without being recorded in the checkbook. The process 
of adjusting the bank and checkbook balances to reflect the actual current balance is known as 
bank statement reconciliation. When we use the word checkbook in this chapter, we are actually 
referring to the records kept by the depositor on the check stubs or in the checkbook register.
Before a statement can be reconciled, you must identify and total all the checks that have been 
written but have not yet reached the bank. These are known as outstanding checks. Outstanding 
checks are found by comparing and checking off each check in the checkbook with those shown 
on the statement. Any checks not appearing on the statement are outstanding checks.
Sometimes deposits are made close to the statement date or by mail and do not clear the bank 
in time to appear on the current statement. These are known as deposits in transit. Just like out-
standing checks, deposits in transit must be identified and totaled. Once again, this is done by com-
paring and checking off the checkbook records with the deposits shown on the bank statement.
A bank statement is reconciled when the adjusted checkbook balance is equal to the 
adjusted bank balance. Most bank statements have a form on the back to use in reconciling 
the account. Exhibit 4-14 is an example of such a form and is used in this chapter.
STEPS FOR PREPARING A BANK STATEMENT RECONCILIATION
STEP 1. Calculate the adjusted checkbook balance:
a. Look over the bank statement and find any credits not recorded in the 
checkbook, such as interest earned or notes collected, and add them to 
the checkbook balance to get a subtotal.
b. From the bank statement, locate any charges or debits such as service 
charges, NSF fees, or returned items that have not been recorded in the 
checkbook and subtract them from the subtotal from Step 1a.
STEP 2. Calculate the adjusted bank balance:
a. Locate all of the deposits in transit and add them to the statement balance 
to get a subtotal.
b. Locate and total all outstanding checks and subtract them from the  subtotal 
from Step 2a.
STEP 3. Compare the adjusted balances:
a. If they are equal, the statement has been reconciled.
b. If they are not equal, an error exists that must be found and corrected. The 
error is either in the checkbook or on the bank statement.

SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
The properly completed reconciliation form is on page 109. Note that the adjusted checkbook 
balance equals the adjusted bank statement balance. The balances are now reconciled. After some 
practice, the format will become familiar to you and you should no longer need the form.
When a bank statement arrives, the  balance 
on that statement will not agree with 
the checkbook balance until the account 
has been reconciled. Remember that both 
 balances need to be adjusted.
To determine which balance, the 
 checkbook or the bank, gets adjusted 
for various situations, ask “Who didn’t know?” 
For example,
t The bank “didn’t know” about  outstanding 
checks and deposits in transit; therefore, 
these adjustments are made to the bank 
 balance.
t The checkbook “didn’t know” the amount 
of the service charges and other debits or 
credits. These adjustments are made to the 
checkbook.

How Banks Process Transactions
According to the FDIC, large banks are 
more likely to clear checks from large to 
small dollar amounts, often resulting in 
more overdraft fees.
For example, let’s say someone has $100 
in his or her checking account and writes 
four checks: $20, $30, $40, and $110. If that 
person’s bank clears the checks from small 
to large, it would charge one overdraft fee. 
However, if the bank clear the checks from 
large to small, it would be able to charge 
four overdraft fees!

the first six months and $2,400 for the next six months.
 
Use the following information to solve the problem.

Deposit slips, or deposit tickets, are printed 
forms with the depositor’s name, address, 
account number, and space for the details of 
the deposit.
Deposit slips are used to record money, 
both cash and checks, being added to the 
checking account. They are presented to 
the bank teller along with the items to be 
deposited.
When a deposit is completed, the depositor 
receives a copy of the deposit slip as a receipt 
or proof of the transaction.

A blank endorsement is used when you want 
to cash the check. You, as the payee, simply 
sign your name exactly as it appears on the 
front of the check and write your account 
number. Once you have endorsed a check in 
this manner, anyone who has possession of 
the check can cash it.

1. Calculate the adjusted checkbook balance:
a. Locate any credits on the statement 
not recorded in the checkbook, such 
as interest earned or notes collected, 
and add them to the checkbook bal-
ance to get a subtotal.
b. Subtract any debits or charges such 
as service charges, NSF fees, or 
returned items from the subtotal 
above.
2. Calculate the adjusted bank balance:
a. Locate all the deposits in transit and 
add them to the bank statement bal-
ance to get a subtotal.
b. Locate all outstanding checks and 
subtract them from the subtotal 
above.
3. Compare the adjusted balances:
a. If they are equal, the statement has 
been reconciled.
b. If they are not equal, an error exists 
that must be found and corrected. 
The error is either in the checkbook 
or on the bank statement.

Rewards Checking  
Recently, a new type of checking account 
has been offered by banks and credit 
unions. These accounts, known as rewards 
 checking, promise to pay high interest rates 
and are without any fees. Rewards checking 
accounts typically require that you use your 
debit card at least 10 times per month and 
that you give up paper bank statements in 
favor of online ones.
You can research various checking 
account offers at such sites as:

BUSINESS DECISION: CHOOSING
A BANK WITH INTEREST
8.
Sometimes banks offer checking accounts that earn interest on the average daily balance of the 
account each month. This interest is calculated using a formula known as the simple interest 
formula. The formula is written as:
Interest = Principal × Rate × Time   I = PRT
The formula states that the amount of interest earned on the account is equal to the principal 
(average daily balance) multiplied by the rate (interest rate per year—expressed as a decimal) 
multiplied by the time (expressed in years—use 1
12 to represent one month of a year).
a. If you have not already done so, complete the Business Decision, Choosing a Bank on 
page 112.
b. Use the simple interest formula to calculate the amount of interest you would earn per 
month if the Intercontinental Bank was offering 2% (.02) interest per year on checking 
accounts. (Note that your average daily balance changes from $900 to $2,400 in the last 
six months of the year.)
c. How much interest would you earn per month at Bank of America if it were offering 1.5 
percent (.015) interest per year on checking accounts? Round to the nearest cent when 
necessary.

COLLABORATIVE LEARNING ACTIVITY
Choosing a Checking Account
Have each team member research a local bank, a credit union, or another financial institution offering 
checking accounts to find the types of checking accounts they have and other banking services they 
offer. As a team, look over the material and answer the following:
a. How do the accounts compare regarding monthly service charges, interest paid, account  
minimums, debit and ATM charges, and other rules and regulations?
b. Do the banks offer any incentives such as a no-fee Visa or MasterCard, bounce-proof checking, 
or a line of credit?
c. Based on your team’s research, which bank would you recommend for each of the following:
r
College student. Why?
r
Small business. Why?
r
Family with three teenagers. Why?
d. Because many banks have failed in recent years, check your bank’s health by looking up its “star 
rating” at www.bauerfinancial.com or www.bankrate.com. Also look over your bank’s financial 
statements filed quarterly with the government at www.fdic.gov. What can you conclude from 
your findings?
d. Recalculate the cost of doing business with Intercontinental Bank and 
Bank of America for a year.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
e. Based on this new information, which of the four banks should you 
choose for your checking account?
122
$)"15&3t$)&$,*/("$$06/54
Opportunity cost is the sacrifice of  benefits 
from the next-best alternative when you 
make a financial or economic decision. To fully 
evaluate how much a checking account with 
a required minimum balance costs, calculate 
the opportunity cost.
Consider a bank that requires an average 
monthly balance of $1,500. If you can earn 
3% a year in interest on an investment main-
taining this checking account means giving 
up $45 in potential interest income.

SOLVING BASIC EQUATIONS
One of the primary objectives of business mathematics is to describe business situations and 
solve business problems. Many business problems requiring a mathematical solution have 
been converted to formulas. A formula is a mathematical statement describing a real-world 
situation in which letters represent number quantities. A typical example of a formula follows:
Business Situation:   Revenue less expenses is profit
Mathematical Formula:   Revenue −Expenses = Profit
  
or
  
R −E = P
By knowing the numerical value of any two of the three parts, we can use the formula to 
determine the unknown part. Formulas are a way of standardizing repetitive business situa-
tions. They are used in almost every aspect of business activity and are an essential tool for 
the businessperson. Later in the book, we see formulas applied to topics such as markup and 
markdown, percents, interest rates, financial ratios, inventory, and depreciation.
As valuable and widespread as formulas are, they cannot anticipate all business situ-
ations. Today businesspeople must have the ability to analyze the facts of a situation and 
devise custom-made formulas to solve business problems. These formulas are actually math-
ematical equations.
In this important chapter, you learn to write and solve equations. At first, some of the 
concepts may seem a bit strange. Equations use letters of the alphabet as well as numbers. 
Do not be intimidated! After some practice, you will be able to write and solve equations 
comfortably.
UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT, TERMINOLOGY, 
AND RULES OF EQUATIONS
In English, we write by using words to form complete thoughts known as sentences. Equations 
convert written sentences describing business situations into mathematical sentences. When 
the statement contains an equal sign (=), it is an equation. If it does not contain an equal sign, 
it is simply an expression. Equations express business problems in their simplest form. There 
are no adjectives or words of embellishment, just the facts.
S + 12 is an expression      S + 12 = 20 is an equation
An equation is a mathematical statement using numbers, letters, and symbols to express 
a relationship of equality. Equations have an expression on the left side and an expression on 
the right side connected by an equal sign.
Letters of the alphabet are used to represent unknown quantities in equations and are 
called variables. In the equation above, S is the variable, or the unknown. The 12 and the 
20 are the constants, or knowns. Variables and constants are also known as the terms of the 
equation. The plus sign and the equal sign separate the terms and describe the relationship 
between them.
To solve an equation means to find the numerical value of the unknown that makes the 
equation true. From our equation S + 12 = 20, what value of S would make the equation 
true? Is it 6? No, 6 plus 12 is 18, and 18 does not equal 20. Is it 10? No, 10 plus 12 is 22, 
and 22 does not equal 20. How about 8? Yes, 8 plus 12 does equal 20.
S + 12 = 20
8 + 12 = 20
20 = 20
By substituting 8 for the variable, S, we have found the value of the unknown that satis-
fies the equation and makes it true: 20 equals 20. The numerical value of the variable that 
makes the equation true (in this case, 8) is known as the solution, or root, of the equation.
formula A mathematical statement describing 
a real-world situation in which letters represent 
number quantities. An example is the simple 
interest formula I = PRT, where interest equals 
principal times rate times time.
equations Mathematical statements 
 expressing a relationship of equality; usually 
written as a series of symbols that are separated 
into left and right sides and joined by an equal 
sign. X + 7 = 10 is an equation.

variables, or unknowns The parts of an 
equation that are not given. In equations, 
the unknowns, or variables, are represented 
by  letters of the alphabet. In the equation 
X + 7 = 10, X is the unknown, or variable.
constants, or knowns The parts of an 
 equation that are given. In equations, the 
knowns are constants (numbers), which are 
quantities having a fixed value. In the  equation 
X + 7 = 10, 7 and 10 are the knowns, or 
constants.
terms The knowns (constants) and unknowns 
(variables) of an equation. In the equation 
X + 7 = 10, the terms are X, 7, and 10.

the equation true.
solution, or root The numerical value of 
the unknown that makes the equation true. In 
the equation X + 7 = 10, for example, 3 is the 
 solution because 3 + 7 = 10.

SOLVING EQUATIONS FOR THE UNKNOWN 
AND PROVING THE SOLUTION
In solving equations, we use the same basic operations we used in arithmetic: addition, sub-
traction, multiplication, and division. The meanings of the signs +, −, ×, and ÷ are still the 
same. Equations have a few new designations, however, that we must learn.
Multiplication of 5 times Y, for example, may be written as
5 × Y
5 · Y
5(Y )
5Y
The number 5 in the term 5Y is known as the coefficient of the term. In cases in which 
there is no numerical coefficient written, such as W, the coefficient is understood to be a 1. 
Therefore,
1W = W.
Division in equations is indicated by the fraction bar, just as in Chapter 2. For example, 
the term 5 divided by Y would be written as
5
Y
It is important to remember that an equation is a statement of equality. To solve an equa-
tion, we must move or transpose all the unknowns to one side and all the knowns to the other 
side. We accomplish this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation. 
By doing the same thing on both sides of the equation, we create a new equation that has the 
same solution as the original equation. It is customary for the unknowns to be on the left side 
and the knowns to be on the right side, such as X = 7.
Transposing involves the use of inverse, or opposite, operations. To transpose a term in 
an equation, (1) note the operation indicated and (2) apply the opposite operation to both sides 
of the equation as follows:
Operation Indicated
Opposite Operation
Addition
Subtraction

Today managers must have the ability 
to analyze the facts of a business  problem 
and devise custom-made formulas to 
solve them.
coefficient A number or quantity 
placed before another quantity,  indicating 
 multiplication. For example, 4 is the  coefficient 
in the expression 4C. This indicates 4 
 multiplied by C.
transpose To move a term from one side of 
an equation to the other. Whenever addition 
or subtraction is used for moving the term, a   
corresponding change of sign occurs.
STEPS FOR SOLVING EQUATIONS AND PROVING THE SOLUTION
STEP 1. Transpose all the unknowns to the left side of the equation and all the knowns 
to the right side of the equation by using the following “order of operations” 
for solving equations.
r  Parentheses, if any, must be cleared before any other operations are per-

The equal sign, two parallel lines (=), was 
invented in the sixteenth century by Robert 
Recorde. He stated, “Nothing can be more 
equal than parallel lines!”
Other related mathematical symbols are:
≈ is approximately equal to
≠ is not equal to
≥ is greater than or equal to
≤ is less than or equal to

Remember, an equation is a statement 
of “equality.” The left side must equal the right 
side for the equation to be true. The word 
equation, in fact, is derived from the word equal.

Parentheses
Sometimes parentheses are used in equations. They contain a number just outside the left-
hand parentheses known as the coefficient and two or more terms inside the parentheses. An 
example is 5(3X + 6) = 20.
Parentheses Rule
In solving equations, parentheses must be removed before any other operations are per-
formed. To remove parentheses, multiply the coefficient by each term inside the parentheses.
To apply this rule to the example above,
5(3X + 6) = 20
5(3X  ) + 5(6) = 20
15X + 30 = 20
Proof:

SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Because this equation contains parentheses, we must begin there. Following the rule for removing

8(2K −4) = 48
8(2K) −8(4) = 48
16K −32 = 48
Now solve the equation as before by isolating the unknown, K, on the left side of the equal sign. 
Remember, add and subtract first, then multiply and divide.

To solve this equation, we begin by combining the two terms on the left side that contain C: 
4C – C = 3C. This leaves
3C + 7 = 25 −6C
Next, move the – 6C to the left side by adding + 6C to both sides of the equation.
3C + 7 = 25 −6C

BUSINESS DECISION: GROUPING SYMBOLS
32. Grouping symbols are used to arrange numbers, variables, and operations. In this chapter, 
you learned to use the grouping symbols known as parentheses ( ). In addition to parentheses, 
other symbols used for grouping are brackets [ ] and braces { }. When solving equations with 
multiple grouping symbols, always start with the innermost symbols and work to the outside.
In business, you may encounter situations that require you to set up equations with more than 
just parentheses. For practice, solve the following equation.
X = 6(2 + [359 −36 + 58 + 16 −4])

USING EQUATIONS TO SOLVE BUSINESS-RELATED WORD PROBLEMS
In business, most of the math encountered is in the form of business-situation word problems. 
Variables such as profits, production units, inventory, employees, money, customers, and 
interest rates are constantly interacting mathematically. Your boss will not ask you simply to 
add, subtract, multiply, or divide, but will ask for information requiring you to perform these 
functions in a business context. Business students must be able to analyze a business situa-
tion requiring math, set up the situation in a mathematical expression or equation, and work 
it out to a correct solution.
SETTING UP AND SOLVING BUSINESS-RELATED 
WORD PROBLEMS BY USING EQUATIONS
In Section I of this chapter, we learned to create and solve equations from written statements. 
Let’s see how to apply these skills in business situations. You will learn a logical procedure 
for setting up and solving business-related word problems. Some problems have more than 
one way to arrive at an answer. The key, once again, is not to be intimidated. Learning to 
solve word problems requires practice, and the more you do it, the easier it will become and 
the more comfortable you will feel with it.
5-4
SECTION II 5
STEPS FOR SETTING UP AND SOLVING WORD PROBLEMS
STEP 1. Understand the situation. If the problem is written, read it carefully, perhaps 
a few times. If the problem is verbal, write down the facts of the situation.
STEP 2. Take inventory. Identify all the parts of the situation. These parts can be any 
variables, such as dollars, people, boxes, tons, trucks, anything! Separate them 
into knowns and unknowns.
STEP 3. Make a plan—create an equation. The object is to solve for the unknown. 
Ask yourself what math relationship exists between the knowns and the 
unknowns. Use the chart of key words and phrases on page 131 to help you 
write the equation.
STEP 4. Work out the plan—solve the equation. To solve an equation, you must 
move the unknowns to one side of the equal sign and the knowns to the other.
STEP 5. Check your solution. Does your answer make sense? Is it exactly correct? It 
is a good idea to estimate an approximate answer by using rounded numbers. 
This will let you know if your answer is in the correct range. If it is not, either 
the equation is set up incorrectly or the solution is wrong. If this occurs, you 
must go back and start again.

On Tuesday, Double Bubble Car Wash took in $360 less in wash business than in wax 
business. If the total sales for the day were $920, what were the sales for each service?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Reasoning: Wax sales plus wash sales equal the total sales, $920.
Let X = $ amount of wax sales
Let X −360 = $ amount of wash sales
X + X −360  =  920
+ 360
+ 360
X + X
= 1,280

This is the real “bottom line” of equations: the 
ability to analyze a business situation, convert 
it to an equation, and solve it. Proficiency will 
come with practice.

Learning Tip
Formulas are a part of our lives. Whether 
you drive a car and need to calculate the 
distance of travel or need to work out 
the volume in a milk container, you use 
algebraic formulas every day without even 
realizing it.
Let’s say, for example, that you have a 
total of $100 to spend on video games. 
When you go to the game store, you find 
that each game sells for $20. How many 
games can you buy? This scenario pro-
vides the equation 20X = 100, where X is 
the number of games you can buy. Most 
 people don’t realize that this type of calcu-
lation is algebra; they just subconsciously 
do it!

Chicken Delight sells whole chicken dinners for $12 and half chicken dinners for $8. 
Yesterday it sold a total of 400 dinners and took in $4,200. How many of each size dinner 
were sold? What were the dollar sales of each size dinner?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Reasoning: The sum of the price multiplied by the quantity of each item is total sales, $4,200.
Hint: This type of problem requires that we multiply the price of each item by the quantity. We 
know that a total of 400 dinners were sold; therefore,
Let X = quantity of whole chicken dinners
Let 400 −X = quantity of half chicken dinners
Note:  By letting X equal the quantity related to the more expensive item, we avoid dealing with 
negative numbers.
Price times quantity of whole chicken dinners = $12X
Price times quantity of half chicken dinners = $8(400 −X)

Yesterday the Valley Vista recycling van picked up a total of 4,500 pounds of material. 
If newspaper weighed three times as much as aluminum cans and aluminum weighed 
twice as much as glass, what was the weight of each material?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Reasoning: Glass plus aluminum plus newspaper amounts to the total material, 4,500 pounds.
Hint: Let the least (smallest) element equal X. That way the larger ones will be multiples of X. 
By doing this, you avoid having fractions in your equation.
Let X = pounds of glass
Let 2X = pounds of aluminum
Let 3(2X) = pounds of newspaper
X + 2X + 3(2X) = 4,500
X + 2X + 6X = 4,500
9X = 4,500
9X
9
= 4,500
9
X = 500
Glass collected = 500 pounds
2X = 2(500) = 1,000
Aluminum collected = 1,000 pounds
   
3(2X) = 3(1,000) = 3,000
  Newspaper collected = 3,000 pounds
Proof:
X + 2X + 3(2X) = 4,500
500 + 2(500) + 3(255006) = 4,500
500 + 1,000 + 3,000 = 4,500

Municipal solid waste (MSW)—more 
commonly known as garbage—consists of 
everyday items we throw away. According 
to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), in a recent year Americans 
generated about 250 million tons of trash 
and recycled and composted 83  million 
tons of this material. On average, we 
recycled and composted 1.5 pounds of our 
individual waste generation of 4.5 pounds 
per person per day.
Recycling and composting 83 million 
tons of MSW saved 1.3 quadrillion Btu of 
energy, the equivalent of more than  
10.2 billion gallons of gasoline and reduced 
CO2 emissions by 182 million metric tons, 
comparable to the annual emissions from 
more than 33 million passenger vehicles.

UNDERSTANDING AND SOLVING RATIO  
AND PROPORTION PROBLEMS
Many business problems and situations are expressed as ratios. A ratio is a fraction that 
describes a comparison of two numbers or quantities. In business, numbers often take on 
much more meaning when compared with other numbers in the form of a ratio.
For example, a factory has an output of 40 units per hour. Is this good or bad? If we also 
know that the industry average is 20 units per hour, we can set up a ratio of our factory, 40, 
compared with the industry average, 20.
Factory
Industry = 40
20 = 40:20   Expressed verbally, we say,“40 to 20.”
Because ratios are fractions, we can reduce our fraction and state that our factory output 
is 2 to 1 over the industry average. If the industry average changed to 40, the ratio would 
be 40
40, or 1 to 1. Had the industry average been 80, the ratio would have been 40
80, or 1 to 2.
Ratios can compare anything: money, weights, measures, output, or individuals. The 
units do not have to be the same. If we can buy 9 ounces of shampoo for $2, this is actually 
a ratio of ounces to dollars, or 9:2.
A proportion is a statement indicating that two ratios are equal. Proportions are equa-
tions, with as representing the equal sign. For example, we could say, “9 is to 2 as 18 is to 4.”
9
2 = 18
4    or  9:2 = 18:4
   
12X + 8(400 −X) =
4,200
   
12X + 3,200 −8X =
4,200
     
4X + 3,200 =
4,200

−3,200
    
4X
=
1,000
    
4X
4 = 1,000
4
    
X = 250
Quantity of whole chicken dinners = 250
     400 −X = 400 −250 = 150
 Quantity of half chicken dinners = 150 
Proof:
12X + 8(400 −X) = 4,200
12(250) + 8(400 −250) = 4,200
3,000 + 8(150) = 4,200
3,000 + 1,200 = 4,200
4,200 = 4,200
Now that we have calculated the quantity sold of each size dinner, we can find the dollar sales.
Reasoning: Dollar sales are the price per dinner multiplied by the quantity sold.
               Let S = dollar sales
Whole chicken dinners:  S = $12(250) = $3,000 in sales
  Half chicken dinners:  S = $8(150) = $1,200 in sales

9 is to 3 as 3 is to 1, written as 9:3 = 3:1.

This means that if we can buy 9 ounces for $2, we can buy 18 ounces for $4. Proportions 
with three knowns and one unknown become a very useful business tool. For example, if we 
can buy 9 ounces for $2, how many ounces can we buy for $7? This proportion, 9 is to 2 as 
X is to 7, would be written as
9 ounces
$2
= X ounces
$7
  or  9:2 = X:7
STEPS  FOR SOLVING PROPORTION PROBLEMS  
USING CROSSMULTIPLICATION
STEP 1. Assign a letter to represent the unknown quantity.
STEP 2. Set up the proportion with one ratio (expressed as a fraction) on each side of 
the equal sign.
STEP 3. Multiply the numerator of the first ratio by the denominator of the second and 
place the product to the left of the equal sign.
STEP 4. Multiply the denominator of the first ratio by the numerator of the second 
and place the product to the right of the equal sign. (Steps 3 and 4 taken 
together are called “cross-multiplication” for reasons that will be clear in our 
first example.)
STEP 5. Solve for the unknown.

PROPORTIONS
On a recent trip, a car used 16 gallons of gasoline to travel 350 miles. At that rate, how 
many gallons of gasoline would be required to complete a trip of 875 miles?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
This situation can be solved by setting up and solving a proportion. The proportion reads:
“16 gallons is to 350 miles as X gallons is to 875 miles”
                  16
350 = X
875
Using cross-multiplication to solve the proportion,
16
350 = X
875    
  350X
  16(875)
350X = 16(875)
350X = 14,000
X = 14,000
350
X = 40 gallons

5 to 3 to 1, retail advertising to national advertising to classified advertising. The Chronicle is 
typically 48 pages in length.
a. How many pages should be advertising, and how many should be news stories?
FedEx Office (formerly FedEx Kinko’s and 
earlier simply Kinko’s) is a chain of stores 
that provides a retail outlet for FedEx 
Express and FedEx Ground shipping as well 
as printing, copying, and binding services. 
Many stores also provide videoconferenc-
ing facilities.
The primary clientele consists of small 
business and home office clients. There are 
more than 2,000 centers in Asia, Australia, 
Europe, and North America. FedEx reports 
$43 billion in annual revenues and has 
more than 300,000 team members. FedEx 
Office’s primary competitors include The 
UPS Store, OfficeMax, Alpha Graphics, 
Staples, Sir Speedy, and VistaPrint.

b.
Based on the industry ratios, how should the pages be divided among the three types of 
advertising?
c. After you made the changes in the advertising distributions ratios, your newspaper began 
making a profit—for the first time in years. If last year’s total advertising revenue was 
$810,000, how much was earned by each type of advertising?
d.
When you accepted the job of advertising manager, in addition to your salary, you were 
promised a 1
50 share of each year’s revenue from retail and classified advertising and a  
1
75 share for national. What bonus will you receive for last year’s sales?
BUSINESS DECISION:  HELPING CAR MANUFACTURERS—SAVING 
THE PLANET!
30. In a move to provide additional sales for U.S. car manufacturers, the White House announced 
the purchase of 17,600 new fuel efficient vehicles for the federal fleet. The new fleet, which 
includes 2,500 hybrid sedans, will cost $285 million.
 
As an accountant in the White House Budget Office (WHBO), you have been asked to calcu-
late the following:
a. If each hybrid vehicle will have an average cost of $24,000, what will be the average cost 
per non-hybrid vehicle? Round to the nearest whole dollar.
b. Furthermore, the White House said that by replacing less efficient vehicles, the government 
will reduce gasoline consumption by 1.3 million gallons per year and prevent 26 million 
pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. On average, how many gallons 
of gasoline and how many pounds of carbon dioxide will be “saved” per year per vehicle? 
Round to the nearest whole gallon and whole pound.
While retail advertising revenue has always 
been greater than national and classified 
revenue, it is now greater than national 
and classified revenue combined.

Solving Equations for the 
Unknown and Proving the 
Solution
Performance Objective 5-2, 
Page 125
To solve equations, we must move or transpose all 
the unknowns to one side and isolate all the knowns 
on the other side.
It is customary for the unknowns to be on the left 
side and the knowns to be on the right side, such as 
X = 33.
To solve for the unknown value, apply an 
inverse, or opposite, operation to both sides of the 
equation.

Solve the equation R + 7 = 12
The equation indicates addition; therefore, use the 
opposite operation: subtract 7 from both sides:
R + 7 =
12
−7 = −7

5                                                     
R = 5
Solve the equation W −4 = 30
The equation indicates subtraction; therefore, use 
the opposite operation: add 4 to both sides:
W −4 =
30
+ 4 = + 4
W
=
34
                                                W = 34
Solve the equation 3G = 18
The equation indicates multiplication; therefore, use 
the opposite operation: divide both side by 3:
3G
3 = 18

G = 6
Solve the equation T
5 = 9
The equation indicates division; therefore, use the 
opposite operation: multiply both sides by 5:
(5)T
5 = 9(5)
 
T = 45

Order of Operations: To solve equations with 
more than one operation, transpose the terms by 
 performing the additions and subtractions first, then 
the multiplications and divisions.

Solving Equations 
Containing Parentheses
Performance Objective 5-2, 
Page 129
To remove parentheses, multiply the coefficient by 
each term inside the parentheses.
Sign Rules: When like signs are multiplied, the 
result is positive. For example, 5(5) = 25 and 
−5(−5) = 25.
When unlike signs are multiplied, the result is 
negative. For example, 5(−5) = −25.
Solve the equation 3(4S −5) = 9
To remove the parentheses, multiply the coeffi-
cient, 3, by both terms inside the parentheses:
3(4S −5) = 9
 3(4S) −3(5) = 9
 
12S −15 = 9
   
12S = 24
S = 2

To combine unknowns in an equation, add or 
 subtract their coefficients and retain their common 
variable. For example, 6B + 4B = 10B.
If the unknowns are on opposite sides of the 
equal sign, first move them all to one side.
Solve the equation 3B + 5 −B = 7
3B + 5 – B = 7
2B + 5 = 7
2B = 2
B = 1

Equations from Written 
Statements
Performance Objective 5-3, 
Page 131
Expressions and equations are created from 
 written statements by identifying the unknowns 
and the knowns and determining the mathematical 
 relationship between them.
The variables are assigned letters of the  alphabet.  
The relationship between the knowns and the 
unknowns involve addition, subtraction,  multiplication,  
and division or a combination of two or more.
Key words indicate what relationship exists 
between the terms (see list, page 131).
If the written statement has a verb such as is, the 
statement is an equation.

Example 1:
Mary and Beth sell furniture at Contempo Designs. 
Last week Mary sold eight fewer recliner chairs 
than Beth sold. Together they sold 30. How many 
chairs did each sell? 
Solution:
Reasoning: Beth’s sales plus Mary’s sales equal total 
sales, 30.
      Let X = Beth’s sales
 Let X – 8 = Mary’s sales
X + X – 8 = 30
2X – 8 = 30
2X = 38
 X = 19  Chairs—Beth’s sales
 X −8 = 11  Chairs—Mary’s sales
Example 2:
One-fourth of the employees at Atlas Distributors 
work in the accounting division. If there are 45 
workers in this division, how many people work for 
Atlas?
Solution:
Reasoning: 1
4 of the total employees are in  
accounting, 45.
Let X = total employees
Let 1
4 X = accounting employees
1
4 X = 45
(4)1
4X = 45(4)
  X = 180 Total employees
Example 3:
Frontier Industries, a small manufacturing  company, 
made a profit of $315,000 last year. If the nine 
investors decide to evenly split this profit, how 
much will each receive?
Solution:
Reasoning: Each investor’s share is the total profit 
divided by the number of investors.
 Let X = each investor’s share
X = 315,000
9
X = $35,000 Investor’s share
Example 4:
The Pet Carnival sells four times as much in cat 
supplies as in fish supplies. If total sales last week 
were $6,800, how much of each category was sold?
Solution:
Reasoning: Fish supplies plus cat supplies equal total, 
$6,800.
Let X = fish supplies
  Let 4X = cat supplies
X + 4X = 6,800
X + 4X = 6,800
5X = 6,800
X = $1,360 Fish supplies
4X = $5,440 Cat supplies
Example 5:
The Male Image, a clothing store, sells suits for 
$275 and sport coats for $180. Yesterday it made 
20 sales, for a total of $4,360.
a. How many suits and how many sport coats were 
sold?
b. What were the dollar sales of each?
Solution a:
Reasoning: The sum of the price multiplied by the 
quantity of each item is the total sales, $4,360.
Let X = suit sales
Let 20 −X = sport coat sales
275X + 180(20 −X) = 4,360
275X + 3,600 −180X = 4,360
95X + 3,600 = 4,360
95X = 760
X = 8 Number of suits sold
20 −X = 12 Sports coats sold
Solution b:
8 suits × $275 each = $2,200 Suits sales
12 coats × $180 each = $2,160 Coats sales

A ratio is a fraction that describes a comparison of 
two numbers or quantities.
A proportion is a statement showing that two 
ratios are equal. Proportions are equations with “as” 
being the equal sign and “is to” being the division 
bar. 
Proportion problems are solved by cross- 
multiplication:
1. Let X represent the unknown quantity.
2. Set up the equation with one ratio on each side 
of the equal sign.
3. Multiply the numerator of the first ratio by 
the denominator of the second and place the 
 product to the left of the equal sign.
4. Multiply the denominator of the first ratio 
by the numerator of the second and place the 
 product to the right of the equal sign.
5. Solve the equation for X.
Example 1:
12 is to 42 as 6 is to X
 12
42 = 6
X
12X = 42(6)
12X = 252
X = 21
Example 2:
If Larry works 6 hours for $150, how much can he 
expect to earn in a 42-hour week?
6
150 = 42
X
   6X = 150(42)
   6X = 6,300
   X = $1,050 Larry’s salary for 42 hours of work

Let X = tables
Let 4X = chairs
Let 2(4X) = sofas
X + 4X + 2(4X) = 520
X + 4X + 8X = 520

 Proof:
 X + 4X + 2(4X) = 520
40 + 4(40) + 2(45406) = 520
40 + 160 + 2(160) = 520
40 + 160 + 320 = 520
520 = 520
16. Reasoning: The sum of the price of each item multiplied by the quantity of each item is the total sales, $3,400.
Remember: Let X equal the more expensive item, thereby avoiding negative numbers.
Let X = Quantity of 35-liter backpacks
Let 40 – X = Quantity of 18-liter backpacks
Price times quantity of 35-liter backpacks = $110X
Price times quantity of 18-liter backpacks = $70(40 – X)
110X + 70(40 −X) = 3,400
110X + 2,800 −70X = 3,400
40X + 2,800 = 3,400
40X = 600
40X
40 = 600
40
X = 15           Quantity of 35-liter backpacks = 15
40 −X = 40 −15 = 25 Quantity of 18-liter backpacks = 25

45,000

Proof:
110X + 70(40 −X) = 3,400
110(15) + 70(40 −15) = 3,400
1,650 + 70(25) = 3,400
1,650 + 1,750 = 3,400
3,400 = 3,400

Now that we have calculated the quantity of each backpack, we can find the dollar sales.
Reasoning: Dollar sales are the price per backpack multiplied by the quantity sold.
Let S = dollar sales
35-liter backpack:  S = $110(15) = $1,650 in sales
18-liter backpack:  S = $70(25) = $1,750 in sales

BUSINESS DECISION: DETERMINING  
THE “BEST BUY”
34. One special type of ratio is known as a rate. A rate is a ratio that compares two quantities 
that have different units, such as miles per hour, calories per serving, pounds per square inch, 
and price per unit. In consumer economics, expressing prices as “price per unit” allows us to 
 determine the “best buy” when comparing various shopping choices. All else being equal, the 
best buy is the choice with the lowest price per unit (unit price).
 
  Donna Kelsch is comparing dry cat food brands for her cats Nicki and Nasty. If Nicki and 
Nasty’s favorite, Funny Fish, comes in the three sizes listed below, which size is the best buy?

UNDERSTANDING AND CONVERTING PERCENTS
It takes only a glance at the business section of a newspaper or an annual report of a company 
to see how extensively percents are applied in business. Percents are the primary way of 
measuring change among business variables. For example, a business might report “revenue 
is up 6% this year” or “expenses have been cut by 2.3% this month.” Interest rates, commis-
sions, and many taxes are expressed in percent form. You may have heard phrases like these: 
“Sunnyside Bank charged 12% on the loan,” “A real estate broker made 5% commission 
on the sale of the property,” or “The state charges a 61
2% sales tax.” Even price changes are 
frequently advertised as percents, “Sears Dishwasher Sale—All Models, 25% off!”
To this point, we have learned that fractions and decimals are ways of representing parts 
of a whole. Percents are another way of expressing quantity with relation to a whole. Percent 
means “per hundred” or “parts per hundred” and is represented by the percent sign, %.
Percents are numbers equal to a fraction with a denominator of 100. Five percent, for 
example, means five parts out of 100 and may be written in the following ways:
5 percent       5%      5 hundredths      5
100      .05
Before performing any mathematical calculations with percents, they must be converted 
to either decimals or fractions. Although this function is performed automatically by the 
percent key on a calculator, Section I of this chapter covers the procedures for making these 
conversions manually. Sections II and III introduce you to some important applications of 
percents in business.
CONVERTING PERCENTS TO DECIMALS AND DECIMALS TO PERCENTS

 decimal point two places to the left. Add 
zeros as needed.
Remember, if there is no decimal point, it 
is understood to be to the right of the digit 
in the ones place. (24 = 24.)

USING THE PERCENTAGE FORMULA  
TO SOLVE BUSINESS PROBLEMS
Now that we have learned to manipulate percents, let’s look at some of their practical appli-
cations in business. Percent problems involve the use of equations known as the percentage 
formulas. These formulas have three variables: the base, the portion, and the rate. In business 
situations, two of the variables will be given and are the knowns; one of the variables will be 
the unknown.
Once the variables have been properly identified, the equations are simple to solve. The 
variables have the following characteristics, which should be used to help identify them:
BASE:
The base is the number that represents 100%, or the whole thing. It is 
the starting point, the beginning, or total value of something. The base 
is often preceded by the word of in the written statement of the situation 
because it is multiplied by the rate.
PORTION:
The portion is the number that represents a part of the base. The portion 
is always in the same terms as the base. For example, if the base is dol-
lars, the portion is dollars; if the base is people, the portion is people; if 
the base is production units, the portion will be production units. The 
portion often has a “unique characteristic” that is being measured or 
compared with the base. For example, if the base is the total number of 
cars in a parking lot, the portion could be the part of the total cars that are 
convertibles (the unique characteristic).
RATE:
The rate is easily identified. It is the number with the percent sign or the 
word percent. It defines what part the portion is of the base. If the rate is 
less than 100%, the portion is less than the base. If the rate is 100%, the 
portion is equal to the base. If the rate is more than 100%, the portion is 
greater than the base.
The following percentage formulas are used to solve percent problems:
Portion = Rate × Base
    P = R × B
Rate = Portion
Base
 
R = P
B
Base = Portion
Rate
 B = P
R
6
base The variable of the percentage formula 
that represents 100%, or the whole thing.
portion The variable of the percentage 
 formula that represents a part of the base.
rate The variable of the percentage formula 
that defines how much or what part the portion 
is of the base. The rate is the number with the 
percent sign.
STEPS FOR SOLVING PERCENTAGE PROBLEMS
STEP 1. Identify the two knowns and the unknown.
STEP 2. Choose the formula that solves for that unknown.
STEP 3. Solve the equation by substituting the known values for the letters in the 
formula.
Hint:  By remembering the one basic formula, P = R × B, you can derive the other two 
by using your knowledge of solving equations from Chapter 5. Because multiplica-
tion is indicated, we isolate the unknown by performing the inverse, or opposite, 
operation, division.
SECTION II
Don’t confuse the word percentage with the 
percent, or rate. The percentage means the 
portion, not the rate.

B
R
P
P  R  B
To solve for rate, R, divide both sides of the equation by B:
P = R × B ⟶ P
B = R × B
B
 ⟶ P
B = R
To solve for base, B, divide both sides of the equation by R:
P = R × B ⟶P
R = R × B
R
 ⟶ P
R = B
Another method for remembering the percentage formulas is by using the Magic Triangle.
The triangle is divided into three sections representing the portion, rate, and base. By 
 circling or covering the letter in the triangle that corresponds to the unknown of the prob-
lem, the triangle will “magically” reveal the correct formula to use.

SOLVING FOR THE PORTION
Remember, the portion is a part of the whole and will always be in the same terms as the base. 
It is found by multiplying the rate times the base: P = R × B. The following examples will 
demonstrate solving for the portion.

What is the portion if the base is $400 and the rate is 12%?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Substitute the knowns for the letters in the formula Portion = Rate × Base. In this problem, 12% 
is the rate and $400 is the base. Do not forget to convert the percent (rate) to a decimal by deleting 
the % sign and moving the decimal point two places to the left (12% = .12).
P = R × B
P = 12% × 400 = .12 × 400 = 48
Portion = $48
Shortcut
Remember to use the % key on your 
 calculator.
12 % × 400 = 48

Republic Industries produced 6,000 stoves last week. If 2% of them were defective, how 
many defective stoves were produced?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To solve this problem, we must first identify the variables. Because 2% has the percent sign, it is 
the rate. The terms are stoves; the total number of stoves (6,000) is the base. The unique charac-
teristic of the portion, the unknown, is that they were defective.
  P = R × B
  P = 2% × 6,000 = .02 × 6,000 = 120
120 = Number of defective stoves last week

SOLVING FOR THE RATE
The rate is the variable that describes what part of the base is represented by the portion. It 
is always the term with the percent sign. When solving for the rate, your answer will be a 
decimal. Be sure to convert the decimal to a percent by moving the decimal point two places 
to the right and adding a percent sign. We use the formula
Rate = Portion
Base
   or   R = P

Pet Supermarket placed an order for 560 fish tanks. If only 490 tanks were delivered, 
what percent of the order was received?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
The first step in solving this problem is to identify the variables. The statement asks “what  percent”; 
therefore, the rate is the unknown. Because 560 is the total order, it is the base; 490 is a part of 
the total and is therefore the portion. Note that the base and the portion are in the same terms, fish 
tanks; the unique characteristic of the portion is that 490 tanks were delivered.
R = P
B
R = 490
560 = .875 = 87.5%
87.5% = Percent of the order received
Note:  Because 560 is the total order, it is the base and therefore represents 100% of the order. If 
87.5% of the tanks were received, then 12.5% of the tanks were not received.
100% −87.5% = 12.5% not received

What percent of the job has been completed?
What percent of the job remains?
What percent of 700 is 56?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
This problem asks what percent, indicating that the rate is the unknown. The 700 is preceded by 
the word of and is therefore the base. The 56 is part of the base and is therefore the portion. Once 
again we use the formula R = P ÷ B, substituting the knowns for the letters that represent them.
R = P

Nuptial Numbers According to the Bridal 
Association of America, in 2009, there were 
over 2.3 million weddings in the United 
States, with a market value of over  
$72  billion. The average cost of a wedding 
was almost $31,000, with 169 guests. The 
 average engagement time was 17 months.
In 1960, an American bride was  typically 
20 years old and a groom was 23. Today 
the  average age of wedding couples is 
26 for the bride and 28 for the groom. 
Approximately 75 percent of all wedding 
receptions take place at a hotel, country 
club, or catering facility.

SOLVING OTHER BUSINESS PROBLEMS  
INVOLVING PERCENTS
In addition to the basic percentage formulas, percents are used in many other ways in busi-
ness. Measuring increases and decreases, comparing results from one year with another, and 
reporting economic activity and trends are just a few of these applications.
The ability of managers to make correct decisions is fundamental to success in business. 
These decisions require accurate and up-to-date information. Measuring percent changes in 
business activity is an important source of this information. Percents often describe a situation 
in a more informative way than do the raw data alone.
For example, a company reports a profit of $50,000 for the year. Although the number 
$50,000 is correct, it does not give a perspective of whether that amount of profit is good or 
bad. A comparison to last year’s figures using percents might reveal that profits are up 45%
over last year or profits are down 66.8%. Significant news!
DETERMINING RATE OF INCREASE OR DECREASE
In calculating the rate of increase or decrease of something, we use the same percentage 
formula concepts as before. Rate of change means percent change; therefore, the rate is the 
unknown. Once again we use the formula R = P ÷ B. Rate of change situations contain an 
original amount of something, which either increases or decreases to a new amount.
In solving these problems, the original amount is always the base. The amount of change 
is the portion. The unknown, which describes the percent change between the two amounts, 
is the rate.
Rate of change (Rate) = Amount of change (Portion)
Original amount (Base)

d.
When photographers, florists, DJs, bands, and other outside vendors are booked through 
your office for events at the hotel, a 51
2% “finder’s fee” is charged. Last year $175,000 of 
such  services were booked. How much did the hotel make on this service?
e. If your boss is expecting $11,000 in “finder’s fee” revenue next year, what amount of these 
services must be booked?
STEPS FOR DETERMINING THE RATE OF INCREASE OR DECREASE
STEP 1. Identify the original and the new amounts and find the difference between 
them.
STEP 2. Using the rate formula R = P ÷ B, substitute the difference from Step 1 for the 
portion and the original amount for the base.
STEP 3. Solve the equation for R. Remember, your answer will be in decimal form, 
which must be converted to a percent.
It is important to remember when solving 
percentage problems that involve “change” 
from an original number to a new number, 
the original number is always the base and 
represents 100%.

If a number increases from 60 to 75, what is the rate of increase?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
In this basic situation, a number changes from 60 to 75 and we are looking for the percent change; 
in this case, it is an increase. The original amount is 60; the new amount is 75.
The portion is the difference between the amounts, 75 −60 = 15, and the base is the original 
amount, 60. We now substitute these values into the formula.
R = P
B = 15
60 = .25 = 25%
Rate of increase = 25%

Sometimes the original amount of something and the rate of change will be known and the 
new amount, after the change, will be the unknown. For example, if a store sold $5,000 in 
merchandise on Tuesday and 8% more on Wednesday, what are Wednesday’s sales?
Keep in mind that the original amount, or beginning point, is always the base and rep-
resents 100%. Because the new amount is the total of the original amount, 100%, and the 
amount of increase, 8%, the rate of the new amount is 108% (100% + 8%). If the rate of 
change had been a decrease instead of an increase, the rate would have been 8% less than the 
base, or 92% (100% −8%).
The unknown in this situation, the new amount, is the portion; therefore, we use the 
 formula Portion = Rate × Base.

Affiliated Insurance estimated that the number of claims on homeowner’s insurance 
would increase by 15% this year. If the company received 1,240 claims last year, how 
many can it expect this year?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Last year’s claims, the original amount, is the base. Because the rate of change is an increase, we 
find the rate by adding that change to 100% (100% + 15% = 115%). Now substitute these values 
in the portion formula.

UNDERSTANDING AND SOLVING PROBLEMS 
INVOLVING PERCENTAGE POINTS
Percentage points are a way of expressing a change from an original amount to a new amount 
without using a percent sign. When percentage points are used, it is assumed that the original 
amount of percentage points is the base amount, or the whole to which the change is com-
pared. For example, if a company’s market share increased from 40 to 44 percent of a total 
market, this is expressed as an increase of 4 percentage points.
The actual percent change in business, however, is calculated by using the formula
Rate of change =
Change in percentage points
Original amount of percentage points
In this illustration, the change in percentage points is 4 and the original amount of per-
centage points is 40; therefore,
Rate of change = 4
40 = .10 = 10% increase in market share

Solving Problems Involving Percentage 
Points
Performance Objective 6-8,  
Page 176
Percentage points are a way of expressing 
a change from an original amount to a new 
amount without using the percent sign. When 
percentage points are used, it is assumed that 
the base amount, 100%, stays constant.
The actual percent change in business, 
however, is calculated by using the formula
Rate of change = Change in percentage points
Original percentage points
After an intensive advertising campaign, 
General Industries’ market share increased 
from 21 to 27%, an increase of 6 percent-
age points. What percent increase in business 
does this represent?
% change = 6

According to Jim Hackler, theurbaneenvironmentalist.com, “the 
people of the United States represent less than 5 percent of the 
world’s  population—yet that 5 percent consumes more than a 
quarter of our planet’s resources. If the rest of the world rose to the 
U.S. level of consumption, four additional planets would be needed 
to supply the resources and absorb the waste!”
Here’s a look at some of Jim’s intriguing findings, “how a single act 
can help (or hurt) the environment—especially when it’s shared by 
millions.”
*UTUPP%BSO)PU
If the thermostat in every house in America were lowered 1 degree 
Fahrenheit during the winter, the nation would save 230 million 
barrels of crude oil—enough to fill an oil tanker 400 times.
4IPXFS1PXFS
If 40 million people were to spend one minute less each day in 
the shower over their lifetime, they would save 4 trillion gallons of 
water—the total amount of snow and rain that falls over the entire 
lower 48 states in a day.
Straight Flush
If home builders had installed one dual-flush toilet instead of a 
standard low-flow toilet in every new house they built in 2008, they 
would have saved 1.65 billion gallons of water a year.
In the Can
One soft drink can recycled by each elementary school student 
in America would save 24.8 million cans. That would be enough 
 aluminum to create 21 Boeing 737 airplanes.
7JSUVBM1BZNFOU
If every American switched to receiving just one bill as an electronic 
statement instead of a paper statement, the one-time savings would 
be 217,800,000 sheets—enough to blanket the island of Key West in 
a single layer of paper.
8SBQBDJPVT
One out of every 3 pounds of the waste that Americans generate is 
for packaging, which each year adds up to 77 million tons—enough 
to fill the Louisiana Superdome 37 times.
#BUI1BSUZ
If every American collected 1 gallon of water once a week while 
waiting for the shower or bathwater to get hot and used it to water his 
or her houseplants, the total saved would be 15.8 billion  gallons of 
water a year—enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at the National Mall in 
Washington, D.C. 2,338 times.

1. 
Assume that a dump received a total of 750,000 pounds of waste 
last week. Use the chart above to allocate the number of pounds 
of waste for each category.
2. 
If recycling one glass bottle or jar saves enough electricity to light 
a 100-watt bulb for four hours, how many bottles or jars will it take 
to light the bulb for a year?
3. 
Americans use 4 million plastic bottles every hour, but only 25% of 
plastic bottles are recycled. At that rate, how many plastic bottles 
are recycled in a week?
4.

THE INVOICE
In business, merchandise is bought and sold many times as it passes from the manufacturer 
through wholesalers and retailers to the final consumer. A bill of sale, or an invoice, is a 
business document used to keep track of these sales and purchases. From the seller’s point 
of view, they are sales invoices; from the buyer’s point of view, they are purchase invoices 
or purchase orders.
Invoices are a comprehensive record of a sales transaction. They show what merchandise 
or services have been sold, to whom, in what quantities, at what price, and under what condi-
tions and terms. They vary in style and format from company to company, but most contain 
essentially the same information. Invoices are used extensively in business, and it is impor-
tant to be able to read and understand them. In this chapter, you will learn how businesses use 
invoices and the math applications that relate to them.
READING AND UNDERSTANDING  
THE PARTS OF AN INVOICE
Exhibit 7-1 shows a typical format used in business for an invoice. The important parts have 
been labeled and are explained in Exhibit 7-2. Some of the terms have page references, which 
direct you to the sections in this chapter that further explain those terms and their business 
math applications. Exhibit 7-2 also presents some of the most commonly used invoice abbre-
viations. These pertain to merchandise quantities and measurements.
With some practice, these terms and abbreviations will become familiar to you. Take 
some time to look them over before you continue reading.
SHIPPING TERMS
Two frequently used shipping terms that you should become familiar with are F.O.B. shipping 
point and F.O.B. destination. F.O.B. means “free on board” or “freight on board.” These terms 
define the shipping charges and when the title (ownership) of the goods is transferred from 
the seller to the buyer. Ownership becomes important when insurance claims must be filed 
due to problems in shipment.
F.O.B. Shipping Point When the terms are F.O.B. shipping point, the buyer pays the ship-
ping company directly. The merchandise title is transferred to the buyer at the manufacturer’s 
factory or at a shipping point such as a railroad freight yard or air freight terminal. From this 
point, the buyer is responsible for the merchandise. It is common for the seller to prepay the 
freight and add the amount to the invoice.
F.O.B. Destination When the shipping terms are F.O.B. destination, the seller is respon-
sible for prepaying the shipping charges to the destination. The destination is usually the 
buyer’s store or warehouse. Unless prices are quoted as “delivered,” the seller then bills the 
buyer on the invoice for the shipping charges.
Sometimes the freight terms are stated as F.O.B. with the name of a city. For example, if 
the seller is in Fort Worth and the buyer is in New York, F.O.B. Fort Worth means the title 
is transferred in Fort Worth and the buyer pays the shipping charges from Fort Worth to New 
York. If the terms are F.O.B. New York, the seller pays the shipping charges to New York 
and then bills the buyer for those charges on the invoice. Exhibit 7-3, Shipping Terms, on 
page 193, illustrates these transactions.
invoice A document detailing a sales 
 transaction that contains a list of goods shipped 
or services rendered with an account of all costs.
7-1
F.O.B. shipping point The buyer pays 
all transportation charges from the vendor’s 
location.
F.O.B. destination The seller pays all 
the shipping changes to the buyer’s store or 
 warehouse and then bills the buyer for these 
charges on the invoice.
F.O.B. Term used in quoting shipping charges 
meaning “free on board” or “freight on board.”

EXTENDING AND TOTALING  
AN INVOICE
Extending an invoice is the process of computing the value in the Total or Amount column for 
each line of the invoice. This number represents the total dollar amount of each type of merchan-
dise or service being purchased. The invoice subtotal is the amount of all items on the invoice 
before shipping and handling charges; insurance; and other adjustments such as discounts, 
returns, and credits. The invoice total is the final amount due from the buyer to the seller.

TRADE DISCOUNTS—SINGLE
The path merchandise travels as it moves from the manufacturer through wholesalers and 
retailers to the ultimate consumer is known as a channel of distribution or trade channel. The 
businesses that form these channels are said to be “in the trade.” In today’s complex econ-
omy, a number of different trade channels are used to move goods and services efficiently.
Trade discounts are reductions from the manufacturer’s suggested list price. They are 
given to businesses at various levels of the trade channel for the performance of marketing 
functions. These functions may include activities such as selling, advertising, storage, service, 
and display.
Manufacturers print catalogs showcasing their merchandise. Often these catalogs contain 
the manufacturer’s suggested list or retail prices. Businesses in the trade receive price sheets 
from the manufacturer listing the trade discounts in percent form associated with each item 
in the catalog. By issuing updated price sheets of trade discounts, manufacturers have the 
flexibility of changing the prices of their merchandise without the expense of reprinting the 
entire catalog.
Trade discounts are sometimes quoted as a single discount and sometimes as a series 
or chain of discounts. The number of discounts is dependent on the extent of the marketing 
services performed by the channel member.
CALCULATING THE AMOUNT  
OF A SINGLE TRADE DISCOUNT
The amount of a single trade discount is calculated by multiplying the list price by the trade 
discount rate.
Trade discount = List price ×Trade discount rate
trade discounts Reductions from the manu-
facturer’s list price given to businesses that are 
“in the trade” for performance of marketing 
functions.
list price Suggested retail selling price of an 
item set by the manufacturer or supplier. The 
original price from which discounts are taken.

CALCULATING NET PRICE BY USING THE NET  
PRICE FACTOR, COMPLEMENT METHOD
The net price is the amount a business actually pays for the merchandise after the discount 
has been deducted. It may be calculated by subtracting the amount of the trade discount from 
the list price.
Net price = List price −Trade discount

Complements are two numbers that add up 
to 100%. The trade discount rate and the net 
price factor are complements of each other. 
This means that if we know one of them, 
the other can be found by subtracting from 
100%.

Frequently, merchants are more interested in knowing the net price of an item than the 
amount of the trade discount. In that case, the net price can be calculated directly from the 
list price without first finding the amount of the discount.
The list price of an item is considered to be 100%. If, for example, the trade discount on 
an item is 40% of the list price, the net price will be 60% because the two must equal 100%. 
This 60%, the complement of the trade discount rate (100% – 40%), is the portion of the list 
price that is paid. Known as the net price factor, it is usually written in decimal form.
net price factor The percent of the list 
price a business pays for merchandise. It is the 
 multiplier used to calculate the net price.
CALCULATING TRADE DISCOUNT RATE WHEN 
LIST PRICE AND NET PRICE ARE KNOWN
The trade discount rate can be calculated by using the now-familiar percentage formula 
Rate = Portion ÷ Base. For this application, the amount of the trade discount is the portion, 
or numerator, and the list price is the base, or denominator.
Trade discount rate = Trade discount
List price

STEPS
TO CALCULATE NET PRICE BY USING  
THE NET PRICE FACTOR
STEP 1. Calculate the net price factor, complement of the trade discount rate.
Net price factor = 100% −Trade discount rate
STEP 2. Calculate the net price.
Net price = List price × Net price factor
Note: This procedure can be combined into one step by the formula.
Net price = List price(100% −Trade discount rate)

TRADE DISCOUNTS—SERIES
Trade discounts are frequently offered by manufacturers to wholesalers and retailers in a series 
of two or more, known as chain or series trade discounts. For example, a series of 25% and 10% 
is verbally stated as “25 and 10.” It is written 25/10. A three-discount series is written 25/10/5. 
Multiple discounts are given for many reasons. Some of the more common ones follow.
Position or Level in the Channel of Distribution A manufacturer might sell to a retailer 
at a 30% trade discount, whereas a wholesaler in the same channel might be quoted a 30% 
and a 15% trade discount.
Volume Buying Many manufacturers and wholesalers grant an extra discount for buying a 
large volume of merchandise. For example, any purchase more than 5,000 units at one time may 
earn an extra 7% trade discount. Retailers with many stores or those with large storage capacity 
can enjoy a considerable savings (additional trade discounts) by purchasing in large quantities.
Advertising and Display Additional discounts are often given to retailers and wholesalers 
who heavily advertise and aggressively promote a manufacturer’s line of merchandise.
Competition Competitive pressures often cause extra trade discounts to be offered. In 
certain industries such as household products and consumer electronics, price wars are not 
an uncommon occurrence.
CALCULATING NET PRICE AND THE AMOUNT OF A TRADE 
DISCOUNT BY USING A SERIES OF TRADE DISCOUNTS
Finding net price with a series of trade discounts is accomplished by taking each trade dis-
count, one at a time, from the previous net price until all discounts have been deducted. Note 
that you cannot simply add the trade discounts together. They must be calculated individually 
unless the net price factor method—a handy shortcut—is used. Trade discounts can be taken 
in any order, although they are usually listed and calculated in descending order.
For illustrative purposes, let’s begin with an example of how to calculate a series of trade 
discounts one at a time; then we will try the shortcut method.
chain or series trade discounts Term 
used when a vendor offers a buyer more than 
one trade discount.
7-6 
Remember, when calculating the net price by 
using a series of trade discounts, you cannot 
simply add the trade discounts together. Each 
discount must be applied to a successively 
lower base.

An industry trade group, also known as 
a trade association, is an organization 
founded and funded by businesses that 
operate in a specific industry. An industry 
trade association participates in public  
relations activities such as advertising, 
education, political donations, lobbying, and 
publishing, but its main focus is collaboration 
between companies, or standardization.
Associations may offer other services, 
such as sponsoring conferences, providing 
networking, hosting charitable events, or 
offering classes or educational materials.

CALCULATING THE NET PRICE OF A SERIES OF TRADE DISCOUNTS 
BY USING THE NET PRICE FACTOR, COMPLEMENT METHOD
As a shortcut, the net price can be calculated directly from the list price, bypassing the trade 
discount, by using the net price factor as before. Remember, the net price factor is the comple-
ment of the trade discount rate. With a series of discounts, we must find the complement of 
each trade discount to calculate the net price factor of the series.
The net price factor indicates to buyers what percent of the list price they actually do pay. 
For example, if the net price factor of a series of discounts is calculated to be .665, this means 
that the buyer is paying 66.5% of the list price.

Northwest Publishers sold an order of books to The Bookworm, Inc., a chain of bookstores. The list 
price of the order was $25,000. The Bookworm buys in volume from Northwest. The Bookworm 
also prominently displays and heavily advertises Northwest’s books. Northwest, in turn, gives The 
Bookworm a series of trade discounts amounting to 35/20/10. Calculate the net price of the order 
and the amount of the trade discount.

CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF A TRADE DISCOUNT 
BY USING A SINGLE EQUIVALENT DISCOUNT
Sometimes retailers and wholesalers want to know the one single discount rate that equates to 
a series of trade discounts. This is known as the single equivalent discount. We have already 
learned that the trade discounts cannot simply be added together.
Here is the logic: The list price of the merchandise is 100%. If the net price factor is the 
part of the list price that is paid, then 100% minus the net price factor is the part of the list 
price that is the trade discount. The single equivalent discount, therefore, is the complement 
of the net price factor (100% – Net price factor percent).

discount that equates to all the discounts in a

Among other indicators, economists use 
wholesale prices as an important barom-
eter of inflation as well as other economic 
trends. Rising wholesale prices inevitably 
lead to higher consumer prices and conse-
quently inflation.
The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a 
weighted index of prices measured at the 
wholesale, or producer, level. A monthly 
release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS), the PPI shows trends in the wholesale 
markets for manufacturing industries and 
commodities markets. All of the physical 
goods-producing industries that make up 
the U.S. economy are included, but imports 
are not. The PPI was once called the 
Wholesale Price Index.

CHAPTERtINVOICES, TRADE DISCOUNTS, AND CASH DISCOUNTS
CASH DISCOUNTS AND TERMS OF SALE
As merchandise physically arrives at the buyer’s back door, the invoice ordinarily arrives 
by mail through the front door. Today more and more arrive by e-mail. What happens next? 
The invoice has a section entitled terms of sale. The terms of sale are the details of when the 
invoice must be paid and whether any additional discounts will be offered.
Commonly, manufacturers allow wholesalers and retailers 30 days or even longer to pay 
the bill. In certain industries, the time period is as much as 60 or 90 days. This is known 
as the credit period. This gives the buyer time to unpack and check the order and, more 
important, begin selling the merchandise. This credit period clearly gives the wholesaler and 
retailer an advantage. They can generate revenue by selling merchandise that they have not 
paid for yet.
To encourage them to pay the bill earlier than the net date, or due date, sellers frequently 
offer buyers an optional extra discount over and above the trade discounts. This is known 
as a cash discount. Cash discounts are an extra few percent offered as an incentive for early 
payment of the invoice, usually within 10 to 15 days after the invoice date. This is known 
as the cash discount period. The last date for a buyer to take advantage of a cash discount is 
known as the discount date.

28. A General Motors incentive program designed to reduce inventory of certain low-selling models 
offers a $7,000 extra dealer incentive for each of these vehicles that the dealer moved into its 
rental or service fleets.
As the accountant for a dealership with a number of these vehicles left in stock, your man-
ager has asked you to calculate certain invoice figures. The normal trade discount from GM is 
18%. If the average sticker price (list price) of these remaining vehicles at your dealership is 
$23,500, calculate the following.
a. What is the amount of the trade discount, including the incentive?
b. What is the trade discount rate? Round to the nearest tenth of a percent.
c. What is the net price (invoice price) to your dealership?
d. If the cars were then sold from the fleets at $1,000 over “invoice” (net price), what is the 
total percentage savings to the consumer based on the list price? Round to the nearest tenth 
of a percent.
e. (Optional) Although these incentive prices reflect extraordinary discounts to the consumer, 
what other factors should a consumer consider before purchasing a “discontinued” brand of 
vehicle?

Both buyers and sellers benefit from cash discounts. Sellers get their money much sooner, 
which improves their cash flow, whereas buyers get an additional discount, which lowers 
their merchandise cost, thereby raising their margin or gross profit.
Cash discounts generally range from an extra 1% to 5% off the net price of the merchan-
dise. A 1% to 5% discount may not seem significant, but it is. Let’s say that an invoice is due 
in 30 days; however, a distributor would like payment sooner. It might offer the retailer a cash 
discount of 2% if the bill is paid within 10 days rather than 30 days. If the retailer chooses 
to take the cash discount, he or she must pay the bill by the 10th day after the date of the 
invoice. Note that this is 20 days earlier than the due date. The retailer is therefore receiving 
a 2% discount for paying the bill 20 days early.
The logic: There are 18.25 twenty-day periods in a year (365 days divided by 20 days). 
By multiplying the 2% discount by the 18.25 periods, we see that on a yearly basis, 2% cash 
discounts can theoretically amount to 36.5%. Very significant!

CALCULATING CASH DISCOUNTS  
AND NET AMOUNT DUE
Cash discounts are offered in the terms of sale. A transaction with no cash discount would 
have terms of sale of net 30, for example. This means the net amount of the invoice is due in 
30 days. If a cash discount is offered, the terms of sale would be written as 2/10, n/30. This 
means a 2% cash discount may be taken if the invoice is paid within 10 days; if not, the net 
amount is due in 30 days. (See Exhibit 7-4.)
Exhibit 7-5 shows a time line of the discount period and credit period on an invoice dated 
October 15. The 2/10, n/30 terms of sale stipulate a cash discount if the bill is paid within 
10 days. If not, the balance is due in 30 days. As you can see, the cash discount period runs for 
10 days from the invoice date, October 15 to October 25. The credit period, 30 days, extends 
from the invoice date through November 14.
Sometimes two cash discounts are offered, such as 3/15, 1/25, n/60. This means a 3% 
cash discount is offered if the invoice is paid within 15 days, a 1% cash discount if the invoice 
is paid within 25 days, with the net amount due in 60 days.
Cash discounts cannot be taken on shipping charges or returned goods, only on the net 
price of the merchandise. If shipping charges are included in the amount of an invoice, 
they must be subtracted before the cash discount is taken. After the cash discount has been 
deducted, the shipping charges are added back to get the invoice total.
7-9 
net amount The amount of money due from 
the buyer to the seller.

CHAPTERtINVOICES, TRADE DISCOUNTS, AND CASH DISCOUNTS
Randy Glasbergen
STEPS TO CALCULATE CASH DISCOUNT AND NET AMOUNT DUE
STEP 1. Calculate the amount of the cash discount by multiplying the cash discount 
rate by the net price of the merchandise.
Cash discount = Net price × Cash discount rate
STEP 2. Calculate the net amount due by subtracting the amount of the cash discount 
from the net price.
Net amount due = Net price −Cash discount
Note:  As with trade discounts, buyers are frequently more interested in the net amount 
due than the amount of the discount. When that is the case, we can simplify the 
calculation by using the complement method to determine the net amount due.
Net amount due = Net price(100% −Cash discount rate)
If arriving merchandise is damaged or is not what was ordered, those goods will be 
returned to the vendor. The amount of the returned goods must also be subtracted from the 
amount of the invoice. They are no longer a part of the transaction.
Remember, shipping charges or returned 
items are not subject to cash discounts. 
These must be deducted from the invoice 
before the cash discount is applied. After the 
discount is taken, shipping charges, if any, are 
added back to get the invoice total.

CALCULATING NET AMOUNT DUE, WITH CREDIT  
GIVEN FOR PARTIAL PAYMENT
Sometimes buyers do not have all the money needed to take advantage of the cash discount. 
Manufacturers and suppliers usually allow them to pay part of the invoice by the discount 
date and the balance by the end of the credit period. This partial payment earns partial 
cash discount credit. In this situation, we must calculate how much partial payment credit
is given.
Here is how it works: Assume a cash discount of 4/15, n/45 is offered to a retailer. A 4% 
cash discount means that the retailer will pay 96% of the bill (100% – 4%) and receive 100% 
credit. Another way to look at it is that every $0.96 paid toward the invoice earns $1.00 credit. 
We must determine how many $0.96s are in the partial payment. This will tell us how many 
$1.00s of credit we receive.

partial payment When a portion of the 
invoice is paid within the discount period.

and the balance on the net date. How much credit does Happy Feet get for the partial 
payment? What is the remaining net amount due to the manufacturer?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Partial payment credit =
Partial payment
100% −Case discount rate
Partial payment credit =
10,000
100% −3% = 10,000

= $10,309.28
Net amount due = Net price −Partial payment credit
Net amount due = $36,700.00 −$10,309.28 = $26,390.72
The extension of partial payment credit by 
vendors is important to small retailers who 
don’t always have the cash flow to take 
advantage of the full cash discount.

STEPS 
TO CALCULATE PARTIAL PAYMENT CREDIT AND NET  
AMOUNT DUE
STEP 1. Calculate the amount of credit given for a partial payment by dividing the 
partial payment by the complement of the cash discount rate.
Partial payment credit =
Partial payment
100% −Cash discount rate
STEP 2. Calculate the net amount due by subtracting the partial payment credit from 
the net price.
Net amount due = Net price −Partial payment credit

DETERMINING DISCOUNT DATE AND NET DATE BY USING 
VARIOUS TERMS OF SALE DATING METHODS
To determine the discount date and net date of an invoice, you must know how many days 
are in each month or use a calendar.
Following are two commonly used memory devices to help you remember how many 
days are in each month. Remember, in a leap year, February has 29 days. Leap years occur 
when the year is evenly divisible by 4 except if the year is also evenly divisible by 400. 
Therefore, 2016, 2020, and 2024 are examples of leap years, while 2000 was not a leap year.

which has twenty-eight.
Each month on a knuckle has 31 days and each month 
between knuckles has 30 days. February has 28.

All Pro Sports Center purchases $45,300 in baseball gloves from Spaulding on May 5. Spaulding 
allows 4/15, n/45. If All Pro sends a partial payment of $20,000 on the discount date, how much 
credit will be given for the partial payment? What is the net amount still due on the order?
C H E C K  Y O U R  A N S W E R S  W I T H  T H E  S O L U T I O N S  O N  P A G E  2 2 3 .
Another way to find these dates is to use the days-in-a-year calendar shown in Exhibit 7-6. 
In Chapter 10, you will be able to use this calendar again to find future dates and calculate 
the number of days of a loan.
STEPS
 TO  FINDING A FUTURE DATE USING  
A DAYS-IN-A-YEAR CALENDAR
STEP 1. Find the “day number” of the starting date.
Note: In leap years, add 1 to the day numbers beginning with March 1.
STEP 2. Add the number of days of the discount or credit period to that day number.
Note:  If the new day number is over 365, subtract 365. This means the future date is in 
the next year.
STEP 3. Find the date by looking up the new day number from Step 2.

TERMS OF SALE—DATING METHODS 
03%*/"3:%"5*/(
When the discount period and the credit period start on the date of the invoice, this is known 
as ordinary dating. It is the most common method of dating the terms of sale. The last day to 
take advantage of the cash discount, the discount date, is found by adding the number of days 
in the discount period to the date of the invoice. For example, to receive a cash discount, an 
invoice dated November 8 with terms of 2/10, n/30 should be paid no later than November 
18 (November 8 + 10 days). The last day to pay the invoice, the net date, is found by adding 
the number of days in the credit period to the invoice date. With terms of 2/10, n/30, the net 
date would be December 8 (November 8 + 30 days). If the buyer does not pay the bill by the 
net date, the seller may impose a penalty charge for late payment.

AccuCare Pharmacy receives an invoice dated August 19 from Bristol Drug Wholesalers 
for merchandise. The terms of sale are 3/10, n/45. If AccuCare elects to take the cash 
discount, what is the discount date? If AccuCare does not take the cash discount, what is 
the net date?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Find the discount date by adding the number of days in the discount period to the date of the 
invoice.
Discount date = August 19 + 10 days = August 29
If the discount is not taken, find the net date by adding the number of days in the credit period to 
the invoice date.

EOM dating, or end-of-month dating, means that the terms of sale start after the end of the 
month of the invoice. Another name for this dating method is proximo, or prox. Proximo 
means “in the following month.” For example, 2/10 EOM, or 2/10 proximo, means that 
a 2% cash discount will be allowed if the bill is paid 10 days after the end of the month 
of the invoice. This is the case for any invoice dated from the 1st to the 25th of a month.  
If an invoice is dated after the 25th of the month, the terms of sale begin after the end of 
the  following month. Unless otherwise specified, the net amount is due 20 days after the 
discount date.

Receipt of goods dating, or ROG dating, is a common method used when shipping times are 
long, such as with special or custom orders. When ROG dating is used, the terms of sale begin 
the day the goods are received at the buyer’s location. With this method, the buyer does not 
have to pay for the merchandise before it arrives. An example would be 2/10 ROG. As usual, 
the net date is 20 days after the discount date.

As the shipping manager for World Imports, answer the following questions.
a. What are the discount date and the net date of an invoice dated March 3 with terms of 3/15 EOM?
b. What are the discount date and the net date of an invoice dated March 27 with terms of 3/15 EOM?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
a. Because the invoice date is between the 1st and the 25th of the month, March 3, the discount 
date on terms of 3/15 EOM would be 15 days after the end of the month of the invoice. The 
net date would be 20 days later.
Discount date = 15 days after the end of March = April 15
Net date = April 15 + 20 days = May 5
b. Because the invoice date is after the 25th of the month, March 27, the discount date on terms 
of 3/15 EOM would be 15 days after the end of the month following the invoice month. The 
net date would be 20 days later.
Discount date = 15 days after the end of April = May 15

The last dating method commonly used in business today is called Extra, Ex, or X dating. With 
this dating method, the seller offers an extra discount period to the buyer as an incentive for 
purchasing slow-moving or out-of-season merchandise, such as Christmas goods in July and 
bathing suits in January. An example would be 3/10, 60 extra. This means the buyer gets 
a 3% cash discount in 10 days plus 60 extra days, or a total of 70 days. Once again, unless 
otherwise specified, the net date is 20 days after the discount date.

Calculating Net Price by Using the Net 
Price Factor, Complement Method
Performance Objective 7-4, Page 197
Net  price factor =
100% −Trade  discount rate
Net price =
List price(100% −Trade  discount rate)
From the previous problem, use the net price 
factor to find the net price of the order for 
Sunglass King.
Net price = 12,7001100% −35%2
Net price = 12,700 × .65 = $8,255

Cycle World Bike Shop orders merchandise 
listing for $5,300 from Schwinn. The net 
price of the order is $3,200. What is the trade 
discount rate?
Trade discount = 5,300 −3,200 = $2,100
Trade discount rate = 2,100
5,300 = 39.6%

Calculating Net Price and the Amount 
of a Trade Discount by Using a Series of 
Trade Discounts
Performance Objective 7-6, Page 202
Net price is found by taking each trade 
 discount in the series from the succeeding net 
price until all discounts have been deducted.
Trade discount = List price −Net price
An invoice with merchandise listing for 
$4,700 was entitled to trade discounts of 
20% and 15%. What is the net price and the 
amount of the trade discount?
4,700 ×   .20 = 940
4,700 −940 = 3,760
3,760 ×   .15 = 564
3,760 −564 = $3,196 Net price
Trade discount = 4,700 −3,196 = $1,504
Calculating Net Price of a Series of Trade 
Discounts by Using the Net Price Factor, 
Complement Method
Performance Objective 7-7, Page 203
Net price factor is found by subtracting each 
trade discount rate from 100% (complement) 
and multiplying these complements together.
Net price = List price × Net price factor
Use the net price factor method to verify 
your answer to the previous problem.

Calculating the Amount of a Trade 
Discount by Using a Single Equivalent 
Discount
Performance Objective 7-8, Page 204
Single equivalent discount =
  1 −Net price factor
Trade discount =
  List price × Single  equivalent discount
What is the single equivalent discount and 
the amount of the trade discount in the 
 previous problem?
Use this to verify your trade discount answer.
Single equivalent discount = 1 −.68 = .32
Trade discount = 4,700 × .32 = $1,504

Calculating Cash Discounts and Net 
Amount Due
Performance Objective 7-9, Page 209
Terms of sale specify when an invoice must 
be paid and if a cash discount is offered. Cash 
discount is an extra discount offered by the 
seller as an incentive for early payment of an 
invoice.
Cash discount =
Net price × Cash  discount rate
Net  amount due =
Net price −Cash discount
Action Auto Parts orders merchandise for 
$1,800, including $100 in freight charges. 
Action gets a 3% cash discount. What is 
the amount of the cash discount and the net 
amount due?
1,800 −100 = 1,700
Net price
Cash discount = 1,700 × .03 = $51
1,700 −51 = 1.649

extra dating as an incentive to entice buyers 
to purchase out-of-season or slow-moving 
 merchandise. Unless otherwise specified, the 
net date is 20 days after the discount date.
Sugar Pine Candy Company buys

CONCEPT REVIEW
1. The document detailing a sales transaction is known as a(n) 
.  
(7-1)
2. F.O.B. shipping point and F.O.B. destination are shipping terms that 
specify where the merchandise 
 is transferred. (7-1)
3. To extend an invoice, for each line, we multiply the number of 
items by the 
 per item. (7-2)
4. To calculate the amount of a single trade discount, we multiply the 
 price by the trade discount rate. (7-3)
5. The 
 price is the amount a business actually pays for 
 merchandise after the discount has been deducted. (7-4)
6. To calculate the net price factor, we subtract the trade discount 
rate from 
 . (7-4)
7. Write the formula for the trade discount rate. (7-5)
8. In a chain or 
 of trade discounts, we calculate the final net 
price by taking each discount one at a time from the previous net 
price. (7-6)
9. As a shortcut, we can use the net price 
 method to calculate the 
net price. (7-7)
10. To calculate the net price factor, we subtract each trade discount 
rate from 100% and then 
 all the complements together. (7-7)
11. A single trade discount that equates to all the discounts in a series 
or chain is called a single 
 discount. (7-8)
12. The “
 of sale” specify when an invoice must be paid and if  
a(n) 
 discount is being offered. (7-9)
13. To calculate the credit given for a partial payment, we divide the 
amount of the partial payment by 100% 
 the cash discount 
rate. (7-10)
14. The most common method for dating an invoice is when the 
 discount period and the credit period start on the date of the 
invoice. This method is known as 
 dating. (7-11)

MARKUP BASED ON COST
Determining an appropriate selling price for a company’s goods or services is an extremely 
important function in business. The price must be attractive to potential customers, yet suf-
ficient to cover expenses and provide the company with a reasonable profit.
In business, expenses are separated into two major categories. The first is the cost of 
goods sold. To a manufacturer, this expense would be the cost of production; to a wholesaler 
or retailer, the expense is the price paid to a manufacturer or distributor for the merchandise. 
The second category includes all the other expenses required to operate the business, such 
as salaries, rent, utilities, taxes, insurance, advertising, and maintenance. These expenses are 
known as operating expenses, overhead expenses, or simply overhead.
The amount added to the cost of an item to cover the operating expenses and profit is 
known as the markup, markon, or margin. It is the difference between the cost and the sell-
ing price of an item. Markup is applied at all levels of the marketing channels of distribution. 
This chapter deals with the business math applications involved in the pricing of goods and 
services.
UNDERSTANDING AND USING THE RETAILING  
EQUATION TO FIND COST, AMOUNT  
OF MARKUP, AND SELLING PRICE OF AN ITEM
The fundamental principle on which business operates is to sell goods and services for a 
price high enough to cover all expenses and provide the owners with a reasonable profit. The 
formula that describes this principle is known as the retailing equation. The equation states 
that the selling price of an item is equal to the cost plus the markup.
Selling price = Cost + Markup
Using the abbreviations C for cost, M for markup, and SP for selling price, the formula 
is written as
SP = C + M
To illustrate, if a camera costs a retailer $60 and a $50 markup is added to cover operat-
ing expenses and profit, the selling price of the camera would be $110.
$60 (cost) + $50 (markup) = $110 (selling price)
In Chapter 5, we learned that equations are solved by isolating the unknowns on one side 
and the knowns on the other. Using this theory, when the amount of markup is the unknown, 
the equation can be rewritten as
Markup = Selling price −Cost     M = SP −C
When the cost is the unknown, the equation becomes
Cost = Selling price −Markup     C = SP −M
The following examples illustrate how these formulas are used to determine the dollar 
amount of cost, markup, and selling price.

Many retailers use a psychological pricing 
strategy known as odd pricing, whereby 
prices are set to end in odd numbers such 
as $0.79, $2.47, and $9.95.
Theoretically, customers perceive odd 
prices as being substantially below even 
prices and therefore a bargain. For example, 
$299.95 is “perceived” as being much lower 
than $300.00.
To psychologically project a prestigious 
image for their products, retailers use even 
pricing such as $10.00 and $500.00.

CALCULATING PERCENT MARKUP BASED  
ON COST
In addition to being expressed in dollar amounts, markup is frequently expressed as a per-
cent. There are two ways of representing markup as a percent: based on cost and based on 
selling price. Manufacturers and most wholesalers use cost as the base in calculating the 
percent markup because cost figures are readily available to them. When markup is based 
on cost, the cost is 100%, and the markup is expressed as a percent of that cost. Retailers, 
however, use selling price figures as the base of most calculations, including percent markup. 
In retailing, the selling price represents 100%, and the markup is expressed as a percent of 
that selling price.
In Chapter 6, we used the percentage formula Portion = Rate × Base. To review these 
variables, portion is a part of a whole amount; base is the whole amount; and rate, as a per-
cent, describes what part the portion is of the base. When we calculate markup as a percent, 
we are actually solving a rate problem using the formula Rate = Portion ÷ Base.
When the markup is based on cost, the percent markup is the rate; the dollar amount of 
markup is the portion; and the cost, representing 100%, is the base. The answer will describe 
what percent the markup is of the cost; therefore, it is called percent markup based on cost. 
We use the formula:
Percent markup based on cost (rate) = Markup (portion)
Cost (base)
   or  %MCOST = M

Because the cost is the unknown variable in this problem, we use the formula C = SP −M.

CALCULATING SELLING PRICE WHEN COST AND 
PERCENT MARKUP BASED ON COST ARE KNOWN
From the basic retailing equation, we know that the selling price is equal to the cost plus the 
markup. When the markup is based on cost, the cost equals 100%, and the selling price equals 
100% plus the percent markup. If, for example, the percent markup is 30%, then
Selling price = Cost + Markup
Selling price = 100% + 30%
Selling price = 130% of the cost
Because of means multiply, we multiply the cost by (100% plus the percent markup).
Selling price = Cost(100% + Percent markup based on cost)
SP = C(100% + %MCOST)
8-3
%MCOST = 33.60
56.00 = .6
Percent markup based on cost = 60%

CALCULATING COST WHEN SELLING PRICE AND 
PERCENT MARKUP BASED ON COST ARE KNOWN
To calculate cost when selling price and percent markup on cost are known, let’s use our 
knowledge of solving equations from Chapter 5. Because we are dealing with the same three 
variables from the last section, simply solve the equation SP = C(100% + %MCOST) for the 
cost. Cost, the unknown, is isolated on one side of the equation by dividing both sides by  
(100% + Percent markup).

BUSINESS DECISION: KEYSTONE MARKUP
25. In department and specialty store retailing, a common markup strategy is to double the cost 
of an item to arrive at a selling price. This strategy is known as keystoning the markup and 
is widely used in apparel, cosmetics, fashion accessories, shoes, and other categories of 
merchandise.
The reasoning for the high amount of markup is that these stores have particularly high 
 operating expenses. In addition, they have a continuing need to update fixtures and remodel 
stores to attract customers.
You are the buyer in the women’s shoe department of the Roma Grande Department Store. 
You normally keystone your markups on certain shoes and handbags. This amount of markup 
allows you enough gross margin so that you can lower prices when “sales” occur and still have 
a profitable department.
a. If you are looking for a line of handbags that will retail for $120, what is the most you can 
pay for the bags?
b. At a women’s wear trade show, you find a line of handbags that you like with a suggested 
retail price of $130. The vendor has offered you trade discounts of 30/20/5. Will this series 
of trade discounts allow you to keystone the handbags?
c. (Challenge) The vendor tells you that the first two discounts, 30% and 20%, are fixed, but 
the 5% is negotiable. What trade discount, rounded to a whole percent, should you request in 
order to keystone the markup?

MARKUP BASED ON SELLING PRICE
In Section I, we calculated markup as a percentage of the cost of an item. The cost was the 
base and represented 100%. As noted, this method is primarily used by manufacturers and 
wholesalers. In this section, the markup is calculated as a percentage of the selling price; 
therefore, the selling price will be the base and represent 100%. This practice is used by most 
retailers because most retail records and statistics are kept in sales dollars.
SECTION  II

CALCULATING PERCENT MARKUP  
BASED ON SELLING PRICE
The calculation of percent markup based on selling price is the same as that for percent 
markup based on cost except that the base (the denominator) changes from cost to selling 
price. Remember, finding percent markup is a rate problem using the now familiar percentage 
formula Rate = Portion ÷ Base.

selling price is 100% and the markup is 
expressed as a percent of that selling price.

For this application of the formula, the percent markup based on selling price is the rate, 
the amount of the markup is the portion, and the selling price is the base. The formula is
Percent markup based on selling price (rate) = Markup (portion)
Selling price (base)
    or    %MSP = M
SP
CALCULATING SELLING PRICE WHEN COST AND PERCENT
MARKUP BASED ON SELLING PRICE ARE KNOWN
When the percent markup is based on selling price, remember that the selling price is the 
base and represents 100%. This means the percent cost plus the percent markup must equal 
100%. If, for example, the markup is 25% of the selling price, the cost must be 75% of the 
selling price.
Cost + Markup = Selling price
75% + 25% = 100%
Because the percent markup is known, the percent cost will always be the complement, or
% Cost = 100% −Percent markup based on selling price
Because the selling price is the base, we can solve for the selling price by using the per-
centage formula Base = Portion ÷ Rate, where the cost is the portion and the percent cost or 
(100% −Percent markup on selling price) is the rate.
Selling price =

CALCULATING COST WHEN SELLING PRICE AND PERCENT 
MARKUP BASED ON SELLING PRICE ARE KNOWN
Often retailers know how much their customers are willing to pay for an item. The follow-
ing procedure is used to determine the most a retailer can pay for an item and still get the 
intended markup.
To calculate the cost of an item when the selling price and percent markup based on sell-
ing price are known, we use a variation of the formula used in the last section. To solve for 
cost, we must isolate cost on one side of the equation by multiplying both sides of the equa-
tion by (100% – Percent markup). This yields the equation for cost:
Cost = Selling price(100% −Percent markup on selling price)
C = SP(100% −%MSP)

The percent markup on cost is always greater 
than the corresponding percent markup on 
selling price because markup on cost uses 
cost as the base, which is less than the selling 
price. In the percentage formula, the lower 
the base, the greater the rate.

MARKDOWNS, MULTIPLE OPERATIONS,  
AND  PERISHABLE GOODS
The original selling price of merchandise usually represents only a temporary situation based 
on customer and competitor reaction to that price. A price reduction from the original selling 
price of merchandise is known as a markdown. Markdowns are frequently used in retailing 
because of errors in initial pricing or merchandise selection. For example, the original price 
may have been set too high or the buyer ordered the wrong styles, sizes, or quantities of 
merchandise.
Most markdowns should not be regarded as losses but as sales promotion opportunities 
used to increase sales and profits. When a sale has been concluded, raising prices back to 
the original selling price is known as a markdown cancellation. This section deals with the 
mathematics of markdowns, a series of markups and markdowns, and the pricing of perish-
able merchandise.
DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF MARKDOWN 
AND THE MARKDOWN PERCENT
A markdown is a reduction from the original selling price of an item to a new sale price. To 
determine the amount of a markdown, we use the formula:
Markdown = Original selling price −Sale price
For example, if a sweater was originally marked at $89.95 and then was sale-priced at 
$59.95, the amount of the markdown would be $30.00 ($89.95 −$59.95 = $30.00).
To find the markdown percent, we use the percentage formula once again, Rate = 
Portion ÷ Base, where the markdown percent is the rate, the amount of the markdown is the 
portion, and the original selling price is the base:
Markdown percent =
Markdown
Original selling price
markdown A price reduction from the 
 original selling price of merchandise.
markdown cancellation Raising prices 
back to the original selling price after a sale 
is over.

In markdown calculations, the original selling price is the base, or 100%. After a markdown 
is subtracted from that price, the new price represents (100% −Markdown percent) of the 
original price. For example, if a chair is marked down 30%, the sale price would be 70%
(100% −30%) of the original price.
To find the new sale price after a markdown, we use the familiar percentage formula, 
Portion = Rate × Base, where the sale price is the portion, the original price is the base, and 
(100% −Markdown percent) is the rate.

Remember, if the markdown is 40%, the sale price must be 60% (100% −40%) of the original 
price.
Sale price = Original selling price(100% −Markdown percent)
Sale price = $55(100% −40%) = 55(.6) = 33
Sale price = $33
Note that markdown percent calculations 
are an application of rate of decrease, 
 covered in Chapter 6.
In the percentage formula, the 
 markdown (portion) represents the amount 
of the decrease and the original selling 
price (base) represents the original amount.

To find the original selling price before a markdown, we use the sale price formula solved for 
the original selling price. The original selling price is isolated to one side by dividing both 
sides of the equation by (100% −Markdown percent). Note: This is actually the percentage 
formula Base = Portion ÷ Rate with the original selling price as the base.

COMPUTING THE FINAL SELLING PRICE AFTER 
A SERIES OF MARKUPS AND MARKDOWNS
Products that do not undergo seasonal fluctuations in sales, such as food, tools, tires, and 
furniture, are known as staple goods. These products are usually marked up once and perhaps 
marked down occasionally, on sale. Seasonal goods, such as men’s and women’s fashion 
items, snow shovels, bathing suits, and holiday merchandise, may undergo many markups 
and markdowns during their selling season. Merchants must continually adjust prices as the 
season progresses. Getting caught with an excessive amount of out-of-season inventory can 
ruin an otherwise bright profit picture. Christmas decorations in January and snow tires in 
June are virtually useless profit-wise!

In March, Swim and Sport purchased designer bathing suits for $50 each. The original 
markup was 60% based on the selling price. In May, the shop took a 25% markdown 
by having a sale. After three weeks, the sale was over and all merchandise was marked 
up15%. By July, many of the bathing suits were still in stock, so the shop took a 30%
markdown to stimulate sales. At the end of August, the balance of the bathing suits were 
put on clearance sale with a final markdown of another 25%. Compute the intermediate 
prices and the final selling price of the bathing suits. Round to the nearest cent.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
When solving a series of markups and markdowns, remember that each should be based on the 
previous selling price. Use the formulas presented in this chapter and take each step one at a time.
Step 1. Find the original selling price, with markup based on the selling price.
Selling price =
Cost
100% −Percent markup =
50
100% −60% = 50
.4 = 125
Original selling price = $125
Step 2. Calculate the 25% markdown in May.
Sale price = Original selling price(100% −Markdown percent)
Sale price = 125(100% −25%) = 125(.75) = 93.75
Sale price = $93.75
Step 3. Calculate the after-sale 15% markup.
Remember, the base is the previous selling price, $93.75.
Selling price = Sale price(100% + Percent markup)
Selling price = 93.75(100% + 15%) = 93.75(1.15) = 107.81
Selling price = $107.81
Step 4. Calculate the July 30% markdown.
Sale price = Previous selling price(100% −Markdown percent)
Sale price = 107.81(100% −30%) = 107.81(.7) = 75.47
Sale price = $75.47
Step 5. Calculate the final 25% markdown.
Sale price = Previous selling price(100% −Markdown percent)
Sale price = 75.47(100% −25%) = 75.47(.75) = 56.60
Final sale price = $56.60

In September, Tire Depot in Chicago purchased snow tires from a distributor for $48.50 each. The 
original markup was 55% based on the selling price. In November, the tires were marked down 
30% and put on sale. In December, they were marked up 20%. In February, the tires were again 
on sale at 30% off, and in March, they cleared out with a final 25% markdown. What was the final 
selling price of the tires? Round to the nearest cent.

Spotting Counterfeit Products
A fake designer purse probably won’t hurt 
you, although your pride might be injured if 
someone discreetly points out that Gucci is 
spelled with two c’s.
But counterfeit electrical items can 
 present a serious risk. The unlabeled $1 
 extension cord at a discount store, for 
example, could electrocute you! Those 
holiday lights found at a flea market could 
catch fire!
Here are some things to watch out for:
t Spelling and grammatical errors on 
packaging
t No contact information
t Absence of a certification mark such as 
UL, Underwriters Laboratories
t Products from different manufacturers 
bundled together
t No-name products
t No UPC bar code
t Unbelievably low prices

CALCULATING THE SELLING PRICE  
OF PERISHABLE GOODS
Out-of-season merchandise still has some value, whereas perishable goods (such as fruits, 
vegetables, flowers, and dairy products) have a certain shelf life and then no value at all. For 
sellers of this type of merchandise to achieve their intended markups, the selling price must 
be based on the quantity of products sold at the original price. The quantity sold is calculated 
as total items less spoilage. For example, if a tomato vendor anticipates a 20% spoilage rate, 
the selling price of the tomatoes should be calculated based on 80% of the original stock. To 
calculate the selling price of perishables, use the formula:
Selling price of perishables =
Total expected selling price
Total quantity −Anticipated spoilage

Going Bananas!
The first load of bananas in the United States 
was sold in 1870 by sea captain Lorenzo Dow 
Baker. He later launched United Fruit, which 
eventually came to be known as the Chiquita 
Corporation. In 1889, however, Captain Baker 
lost control of his company as members of 
the board of directors gained a majority own-
ership by secretly purchasing shares in the 
company, achieving a majority ownership, 
and then removing him from the governing 
board. One hundred years later, Chiquita 
annual net sales were over $3 billion.

The Farmer’s Market buys 1,500 pounds of fresh bananas at a cost of $0.60 a pound. If a 
15% spoilage rate is anticipated, at what price per pound should the bananas be sold to 
achieve a 50% markup based on selling price? Round to the nearest cent.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. Find the total expected selling price: The total expected selling price is found by 
applying the selling price formula, SP = C ÷ (100% −%MSP). The cost will be the 
total pounds times the price per pound, 1,500 × $.60 = $900.
SP =
Cost
100% −%MSP
=
900
100% −50%
= 900
.5
= 1,800
Total expected selling price = $1,800
Step 2. Find the anticipated spoilage: To find the amount of anticipated spoilage, use the 
formula
Anticipated spoilage = Total quantity × Spoilage rate
Anticipated spoilage = 1,500 × 15% = 1,500(.15) = 225
Anticipated spoilage = 225 pounds
Step 3. Calculate the selling price of the perishables:
Selling price of perishables =
Total expected selling price
Total quantity −Anticipated spoilage
Selling price =
1,800
1,500 −225
= 1,800
1,275
= 1.411
Selling price of bananas = $1.41 per pound

SECTION III
What would eventually become Target 
began in 1902 as Dayton’s Dry Goods 
Company. The company entered the 
mass-market retail world in 1962,  opening 
the very first Target. In 1995, the first 
SuperTarget, which includes an in-store 
grocery, opened. In 1999, architect Michael 
Graves, the first of more than 75 designers 
to do so, created an exclusive product line 
for Target. Typical Target annual revenues 
now exceed $60 billion.

The basic retailing equation is used to solve 
for selling price (SP), cost (C), and amount 
of markup (M).
Selling price = Cost + Markup
SP = C + M
Cost = Selling price −Markup
C = SP −M
Markup = Selling price −Cost
M = SP −C
1. What is the selling price of a blender that 
costs $86.00 and has a $55.99 markup?
SP = 86.00 + 55.99
Selling price = $141.99
2. What is the cost of a radio that sells for 
$125.50 and has a $37.29 markup?
C = 125.50 −37.29
Cost = $88.21
3. What is the markup on a set of dishes 
costing $53.54 and selling for $89.95?

BUSINESS DECISION: MAINTAINED MARKUP
16. The markup that a retail store actually realizes on the sale of its goods is called maintained 
markup. It is what is achieved after “retail reductions” (markdowns) have been subtracted from 
the initial markup. Maintained markup is one of the “keys to profitability” in retailing. It is the 
difference between the actual selling price and the cost and therefore has a direct effect on net 
profits.
Maintained markup = Actual selling price −Cost

Retailing and the Demographic Generations
Understanding the shopping and media habits of different age groups can help marketers optimize 
 product assortment, pricing, promotion, and advertising decisions by creating targeted strategies and 
special offers. As an example, consider the following.
According to USA Today, in the book Gen buY: How Tweens, Teens, and Twenty-Somethings 
Are Revolutionizing Retail, authors Kit Yarrow and Jane O’Donnell say Generation Y—today’s teens, 
tweens, and twenty-somethings were the least likely to cut back spending during a recession.
What’s more, the authors point out that the 84 million Generation Y’ers, born from 1978 through 
2000, are so influential, they’ve changed shopping for all consumers. They call Gen Y “the taste-
makers, influencers, and most enthusiastic buyers of today” who will become “the mature, high-income 
purchasers of the future.”
Because of Gen Y, we now have, among other things:
r
More creative, technically advanced websites
r
A wide availability of online customer reviews
r
A faster stream of product introductions
r
Bigger, more comfortable dressing rooms
Source: USA Today, “Generation Y forces retailers to keep up with technology, new stuff,” by Richard Eisenberg, Sept. 14, 2009, 
page 6B.
As a team, divide up the four major demographic generations: the Silent Generation: the Baby 
Boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y (aka the Millennials) to research the following questions 
and report your findings to the class. Use visual presentations whenever possible and be sure to site 
your sources.
1. How did each generation get its distinctive name? List any “subgroups” that have been defined, 
such as Baby Boomers – Young and Baby Boomers – Old.
2. Define each generation in terms of years born, size, income and purchasing power, lifestyle 
 preferences, and particularly consumer buying behavior.
3. How and to what extent does each generation use the Internet?
4. How do manufacturers, retailers, and shopping malls use these demographic distinctions to 
“ target” their marketing efforts to the various generations? Give specific examples.

EMPLOYEE’S GROSS EARNINGS AND INCENTIVE PAY PLANS
Because payroll is frequently a company’s largest operating expense, efficient payroll prep-
aration and record keeping are extremely important functions in any business  operation. 
Although today most businesses computerize their payroll functions, it is important for 
businesspeople to understand the processes and procedures involved.
Employers are responsible for paying employees for services rendered to the company 
over a period of time. In addition, the company is responsible for withholding certain taxes 
and other deductions from an employee’s paycheck and depositing those taxes with the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through authorized financial institutions. Other deductions, 
such as insurance premiums and charitable contributions, are also disbursed by the employer 
to the appropriate place.
In business, the term gross pay, or gross earnings means the total amount of earnings 
due an employee for work performed before payroll deductions are withheld. The net pay,
net earnings, or take-home pay is the actual amount of the employee’s paycheck after all 
payroll deductions have been withheld. This concept is easily visualized by the formula
Net pay = Gross pay −Total deductions
This chapter deals with the business math involved in payroll management: the computa-
tion of employee gross earnings; the calculation of withholding taxes and other deductions; 
and the associated governmental deposits, regulations, and record keeping requirements.
PRORATING ANNUAL SALARY ON THE BASIS OF WEEKLY, 
BIWEEKLY, SEMIMONTHLY, AND MONTHLY PAY PERIODS
Employee compensation takes on many forms in the business world. Employees who hold 
managerial, administrative, or professional positions are paid a salary. A salary is a fixed 
gross amount of pay equally distributed over periodic payments without regard to the number 
of hours worked. Salaries are usually expressed as an annual, or yearly, amount. For example, 
a corporate accountant might receive an annual salary of $50,000.
Although salaries may be stated as annual amounts, they are usually distributed to 
employees on a more timely basis. A once-a-year paycheck would be a real trick to manage! 
Employees are most commonly paid in one of the following ways:
Weekly
52 paychecks per year
Annual salary ÷ 52
Biweekly
26 paychecks per year
Annual salary ÷ 26
Semimonthly
24 paychecks per year
Annual salary ÷ 24
Monthly
12 paychecks per year
Annual salary ÷ 12

CALCULATING GROSS PAY BY HOURLY WAGES, 
INCLUDING REGULAR AND OVERTIME RATES
Wages are earnings for routine or manual work, usually based on the number of hours worked. 
An hourly wage, or hourly rate is the amount an employee is paid for each hour worked. The 
hourly wage is the most frequently used pay method and is designed to compensate employ-
ees for the amount of time spent on the job. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, a federal 
law, specifies that a standard work week is 40 hours and overtime, amounting to at least 11
2 
times the hourly rate, must be paid for all hours worked over 40 hours per week. Paying an 
employee 11
2 times the hourly rate is known as time-and-a-half.
Many companies have taken overtime a step farther than required by compensating 
employees at time-and-a-half for all hours over 8 hours per day instead of 40 hours per week. 
Another common payroll benefit is when companies pay double time, twice the hourly rate, 
for holidays, midnight shifts, and weekend hours.

According to the Department of Labor, as of January 2013,16 states and Washington, 
D.C., had minimum wage rates higher than the federal minimum wage. Four states and Puerto 
Rico had minimum wage rates lower than the federal standard.
STEPS  
  TO CALCULATE AN EMPLOYEE’S  
GROSS PAY BY HOURLY WAGES
STEP 1. Calculate an employee’s regular gross pay for working 40 hours or less.
Regular pay = Hourly rate × Regular hours worked
STEP 2. Calculate an employee’s overtime pay by chain multiplying the hourly rate by 
the overtime factor by the number of overtime hours.
Overtime pay = Hourly rate × Overtime factor × Overtime hours worked
STEP 3. Calculate total gross pay.
Total gross pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay
CALCULATING GROSS PAY BY STRAIGHT AND 
DIFFERENTIAL PIECEWORK SCHEDULES
A piecework pay rate schedule is based not on time but on production output. The incentive is 
that the more units the worker produces, the more money he or she makes. A straight piece-
work plan is when the worker receives a certain amount of pay per unit of output regardless 
of output quantity. A differential piecework plan gives workers a greater incentive to increase 
output because the rate per unit increases as output goes up. For example, a straight piece-
work plan might pay $3.15 per unit, whereas a differential plan might pay $3.05 for the first 
50 units produced, $3.45 for units 51–100, and $3.90 for any units over 100.

output regardless of output quantity.
differential piecework plan Greater 
incentive method of compensation than

Payroll is a very important business 
responsibility. Employees must be paid on a 
regular basis, and accurate records must be 
kept for government reporting.
t Payroll is usually one of the largest 
“expense” categories of a company.
t The department responsible for the 
payroll function may be called Payroll, 
Personnel, or Human Resources.
t In recent years, companies have evolved 
that specialize in doing payroll. When a 
business hires an outside firm to perform 
a function such as payroll, this is known 
as outsourcing.

Karen Sullivan earns $8 per hour as a checker on an assembly line. If her overtime rate is 
time-and-a-half, what is her total gross pay for working 46 hours last week?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To find Karen’s total gross pay, compute her regular pay plus overtime pay.
Regular pay = Hourly rate × Regular hours worked
Regular pay = 8 × 40 = $320
Overtime pay = Hourly rate × Overtime factor × Overtime hours worked
Overtime pay = 8 × 1.5 × 6 = $72
Total gross pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Total gross pay = 320 + 72 = $392

Commission is a method of compensation primarily used to pay employees who sell a com-
pany’s goods or services. Straight commission is based on a single specified percentage of 
the sales volume attained. For example, Delta Distributors pays its sales staff a commission 
of 8% on all sales. Incremental commission is much like the differential piecework rate 
whereby higher levels of sales earn increasing rates of commission. An example would be 
5%  commission on all sales up to $70,000, 6% on sales greater than $70,000 and up to 
$120,000, and 7% commission on any sales greater than $120,000.

What was the total gross pay for a sales rep who sold $162,400 last month?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Using an incremental commission schedule, we find the pay for each level and then add the totals 
from each level. In this problem, the sales rep will be paid for all of level 1, $50,000; for all of 
level 2, $100,00; and for $12,400 of level 3 ($162,400 −$150,000 = $12,400).
Level pay = Sales per level × Commission rate
Level 1 pay = 50,000 × .04 = $2,000
Level 2 pay = 100,000 × .05 = $5,000
Level 3 pay = 12,400 × .065 = $806

EMPLOYEE’S PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS
“Hey! What happened to my paycheck?” This is the typical reaction of employees on seeing 
their paychecks for the first time after a raise or a promotion. As we will see, gross pay is by 
no means the amount of money the employee takes home.
Employers, by federal law, are required to deduct or withhold certain funds, known as 
deductions or withholdings, from an employee’s paycheck. Employee payroll deductions fall 
into two categories: mandatory and voluntary. The three major mandatory deductions most 
workers in the United States are subject to are social security, Medicare, and federal income 
tax. Other mandatory deductions found only in some states are state income tax and state 
disability insurance.
In addition to the mandatory deductions, employees may also choose to have voluntary 
deductions taken out of their paychecks. Some examples include payments for life or health 
insurance premiums, union or professional organization dues, credit union savings deposits 
or loan payments, stock or bond purchases, and charitable contributions.
After all the deductions have been subtracted from the employee’s gross earnings, the 
remaining amount is known as net, or take-home, pay.
Net pay = Gross pay −Total deductions
COMPUTING FICA TAXES, BOTH SOCIAL SECURITY AND 
MEDICARE, WITHHELD FROM AN EMPLOYEE’S PAYCHECK
In 1937 during the Great Depression, Congress enacted legislation known as the Federal 
Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) with the purpose of providing monthly benefits to retired 
and disabled workers and to the families of deceased workers. This social security tax, which 
is assessed to virtually every worker in the United States, is based on a certain percent of the 
worker’s income up to a specified limit or wage base per year. When the tax began in 1937, 
the tax rate was 1% up to a wage base of $3,000. At that time, the maximum a worker could 
be taxed per year for social security was $30 (3,000 × .01).
Today the FICA tax is divided into two categories. Social security tax (OASDI, which 
stands for Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) is a retirement plan, and Medicare 
tax is for health care and hospital insurance. The social security wage base changes every 
year. For the most current information, consult the Internal Revenue Service, Circular E, 
Employer’s Tax Guide. As this is written, the following rates and wage base were in effect 
for the FICA tax and should be used for all exercises in this chapter:

Federal Insurance Contribution Act 
(FICA) Federal legislation enacted in 1937  during 
the Great Depression to provide  retirement 
funds and hospital insurance for retired and 
disabled workers. Today FICA is divided into two 
 categories, social security and Medicare.
wage base The amount of earnings up to 
which an employee must pay social security tax.
social security tax (OASDI) Old Age, 
Survivors, and Disability Insurance—a federal tax 
based on a percentage of a worker’s income up to 
a specified limit or wage base for the purpose of 
providing monthly benefits to retired and disabled 
workers and to the families of deceased workers.
Medicare tax A federal tax used to provide 
health care benefits and hospital insurance to 
retired and disabled workers.
d. How much in “additional wages” will Delicious have to pay out next year at the adjusted rate?
e. (Optional) Go to www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm and click on your state to find the 
current minimum wage. Calculate the weekly “minimum wage” portion of the restaurant’s 
payroll assuming the restaurant is located in your state.

When an employee reaches the wage base for the year, he or she is no longer subject to 
the tax. Based on the table on the previous page, the maximum social security tax per year is 
limited to $7,049.40 (113,700 × .062). There is no limit on the amount of Medicare tax. The 
1.45% is in effect regardless of how much an employee earns.

In the pay period when an employee’s year-to-date (YTD) earnings reach and surpass the 
wage base for social security, the tax is applied only to the portion of the earnings below

SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To find the withholdings, we apply the tax rates for social security (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%) 
to the gross earnings for the week:
Social security tax = Gross earnings × 6.2%
Social security tax = 650 × .062 = $40.30
Medicare tax = Gross earnings × 1.45%
Medicare tax = 650 × .0145 = 9.425 = $9.43

CALCULATING AN EMPLOYEE’S FEDERAL INCOME TAX 
WITHHOLDING (FIT) BY THE PERCENTAGE METHOD
In addition to social security and Medicare tax withholdings, an employer is also  responsible, 
by federal law, for withholding an appropriate amount of federal income tax (FIT) from 
each employee’s paycheck. This graduated tax allows the government a steady flow of tax 
 revenues throughout the year. Self-employed persons must send quarterly tax payments based 
on estimated earnings to the Internal Revenue Service. By IRS rules, 90% of the income tax 
due for a given calendar year must be paid within that year to avoid penalties.
The amount of income tax withheld from an employee’s paycheck is determined by his 
or her amount of gross earnings, marital status, and the number of withholding allowances, 
or exemptions, claimed. Employees are allowed one exemption for themselves, one for their 
spouse if the spouse does not work, and one for each dependent child or elderly parent living 
with the taxpayer but not working.
Each employee is required to complete a form called W-4, Employee’s Withholding 
Allowance Certificate. The information provided on this form is used by the employer in 
 calculating the amount of income tax withheld from the paycheck. Employees should keep 
track of their tax liability during the year and adjust the number of exemptions as their 
 personal situations change (i.e., marriage, divorce, or birth of a child).
The percentage method for determining the amount of federal income tax withheld from 
an employee’s paycheck is used by companies whose payroll processing is on a computerized 
system. The amount of tax withheld is based on the amount of gross earnings, the marital 
status of the employee, and the number of withholding allowances claimed.
The percentage method of calculating federal income tax requires the use of two tables. 
The first is the Percentage Method Amount for One Withholding Allowance Table, Exhibit 
9-1. This table shows the dollar amount of one withholding allowance for the various payroll 
periods. The second, Exhibit 9-2, is the Tables for Percentage Method of Withholding. These 
tables were in effect as this is written and should be used for the exercises in this chapter. 
9-6
federal income tax (FIT) A graduated 
tax based on gross earnings, marital status, 
and number of exemptions that is paid by all 
 workers earning over a certain amount in the 
United States.
withholding allowance, or 
exemption An amount that reduces an 
employee’s taxable income. Employees are 
allowed one exemption for themselves, one for 
their spouse if the spouse does not work, and 
one for each dependent child or elderly parent 
living with the taxpayer but not working.
percentage method An alternative method 
to the wage bracket tables used to calculate the 
amount of an employee’s federal income tax 
withholding.
Earnings subject to tax = Wage base −Year-to-date earnings
Earnings subject to tax = 113,700 −110,900 = $2,800
Social security tax = Earnings subject to tax × 6.2%
Social security tax = 2,800 × .062 = $173.60

STEPS
TO CALCULATE THE INCOME TAX WITHHELD  
BY THE PERCENTAGE METHOD
STEP 1. Using the proper payroll period, multiply one withholding allowance, Exhibit 
9-1, by the number of allowances claimed by the employee.
STEP 2. Subtract that amount from the employee’s gross earnings to find the wages 
subject to federal income tax.
STEP 3. From Exhibit 9-2, locate the proper segment (Table 1, 2, 3, or 4)  corresponding 
to the employee’s payroll period. Within that segment, use the left side 
(a) for single employees and the right side (b) for married employees.
STEP 4. Locate the “Over—” and “But not over—” brackets containing the employee’s 
taxable wages from Step 2. The tax is listed to the right as a percent or a dollar 
amount and a percent.

Lori Fast is a manager for Wayward Wind Travel. She is single and is paid $750 weekly. 
She claims two withholding allowances. Using the percentage method, calculate the 
amount of income tax that should be withheld from her paycheck each week.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
From Exhibit 9-1, the amount of one withholding allowance for an employee paid weekly is 
$75.00. Multiply this amount by the number of allowances claimed, two.
75.00 × 2 = $150.00
Subtract that amount from the gross earnings to get taxable income.
750.00 −150.00 = $600.00
From Exhibit 9-2, find the tax withheld from Lori’s paycheck in Table 1(a), Weekly payroll period, 
Single person. Lori’s taxable wages of $600.00 fall in the category “Over $214, but not over 
$739.” The tax, therefore, is $17.20 plus 15% of the excess over $214.
Tax = 17.20 + .15(600.00 −214.00)
Tax = 17.20 + .15(386.00)
Tax = 17.20 + 57.90 = $75.10

DETERMINING AN EMPLOYEE’S TOTAL WITHHOLDING FOR 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX, SOCIAL SECURITY, AND MEDICARE 
USING THE COMBINED WAGE BRACKET TABLES
In 2001, the IRS introduced combined wage bracket tables that can be used to determine the 
combined amount of income tax, social security, and Medicare that must be withheld from 
an employee’s gross earnings each pay period. These tables are found in Publication 15-A, 
Employer’s Supplemental Tax Guide. This publication contains a complete set of tables for 
both single and married people, covering weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly, and even 
daily pay periods.
Exhibit 9-3 shows a portion of the wage bracket tables for Married Persons—Weekly 
Payroll Period, and Exhibit 9-4 shows a portion of the wage bracket table for Single Persons—
Monthly Payroll Period. These tables were in effect as this is written and should be used to 
solve wage bracket problems in this chapter.

Use the combined wage bracket tables to determine the amount of income tax, social 
security, and Medicare withheld from the monthly paycheck of Erin Lane, a single 
employee claiming three withholding allowances and earning $2,975 per month.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To find Erin Lane’s monthly income tax withholding, choose the table for Single Persons—
Monthly Payroll Period, Exhibit 9-4. Scanning down the “At least” and “But less than” columns, 
we find the wage bracket containing Erin’s earnings: “At least 2,960—But less than 3,000.”
Next, scan across that row from left to right to the “3” withholding allowances column. The 
number at that intersection, $463.97, is the total combined tax to be withheld from Erin’s paycheck.
TRYITEXERCISE 12
Using the combined wage bracket tables, what is the total amount of income tax, social security, 
and Medicare that should be withheld from Brent Andrus’s weekly paycheck of $835 if he is

All employees must have a Social Security 
number. Applications are available at all U.S. 
Post Offices or may be downloaded online at 
www.socialsecurity.gov.
Social Security numbers are used by the 
IRS as a taxpayer identification number as 
well as by banks, credit unions, and other 
financial institutions for reporting income 
from savings and other investments.
Information about an individual’s Social 
Security account can be obtained by filing 
a Form 7004-SM—Request for Earnings and 
Benefit Estimate Statement. The form may 
be obtained by calling the Social Security 
Administration at 1-800-772-1213 or by 
transmitting your request using an online 
form via the Internet.

STEPS
TO FIND THE TOTAL INCOME TAX, SOCIAL SECURITY,  
 AND MEDICARE WITHHELD USING THE COMBINED  
WAGE BRACKET TABLE
STEP 1. Based on the employee’s marital status and period of payment, find the 
 corresponding table (Exhibit 9-3 or 9-4).
STEP 2. Note that the two left-hand columns, labeled “At least” and “But less than,” 
are the wage brackets. Scan down these columns until you find the bracket 
containing the gross pay of the employee.
STEP 3. Scan across the row of that wage bracket to the intersection of the column 
containing the number of withholding allowances claimed by the employee.
STEP 4. The number in that column on the wage bracket row is the amount of  combined 
tax withheld.

EMPLOYER’S PAYROLL EXPENSES AND SELF-EMPLOYED 
PERSON’S TAX RESPONSIBILITY
To this point, we have discussed payroll deductions from the employee’s point of view. 
Now let’s take a look at the payroll expenses of the employer. According to the Fair Labor 
Standards Act, employers are required to maintain complete and up-to-date earnings records 
for each employee.
Employers are responsible for the payment of four payroll taxes: social security, Medicare, 
state unemployment tax (SUTA), and federal unemployment tax (FUTA). In addition, most 
employers are responsible for a variety of fringe benefits that are offered to their employees. 
These are benefits over and above an employee’s normal earnings and can be a significant 
expense to the employer. Some typical examples are retirement plans, stock option plans, 
holiday leave, sick days, health and dental insurance, and tuition reimbursement. This  section 
deals with the calculation of these employer taxes as well as the tax responsibility of self-
employed persons.

Employers are required to match all FICA tax payments, both social security and Medicare, 
made by each employee. For example, if a company withheld a total of $23,000 in FICA 
taxes from its employee paychecks this month, the company would be responsible for a 
matching share of $23,000.

The self-employment tax, officially known as the Self-Employment Contributions Act 
(SECA) tax, is the self-employed person’s version of the FICA tax. It is due on the net 
 earnings from self-employment.
Self-employed persons are responsible for social security and Medicare taxes at twice 
the rate deducted for employees. Technically, they are the employee and the employer and 
therefore must pay both shares. For a self-employed person, the social security and Medicare 
tax rates are twice the normal rates, as follows:

What are the social security and Medicare taxes of a self-employed landscaper with net 
earnings of $43,800 per year?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To find the amount of self-employment tax due, we apply the self-employed tax rates, 12.4% for 
social security and 2.9% for Medicare, to the net earnings.
Social security tax = Net earnings × Tax rate
Social security tax = 43,800 × .124 = $5,431.20
Medicare tax = Net earnings × Tax rate
Medicare tax = 43,800 × .029 = $1,270.20
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To solve for the total FICA tax due quarterly from the employees and the employer, calculate the 
tax due per employee per week, multiply by 25 to find the total weekly FICA for all employees, 
and multiply by 13 weeks to find the total quarterly amount withheld from all employees. The 
employer’s share will be an equal amount.
a. Social security tax = Gross earnings × 6.2% = 250 × .062 = $15.50
Medicare tax = Gross earnings × 1.45% = 250 × .0145 = $3.63
Total FICA tax per employee per week = 15.50 + 3.63 = $19.13
b. Total FICA tax per week = FICA tax per employee × 25 employees
Total FICA tax per week = 19.13 × 25 = $478.25
 Total FICA tax first quarter = Total FICA tax per week × 13 weeks
Total FICA tax first quarter = 478.25 × 13 = 6,217.25
 Total FICA tax first quarter—Employee’s share = $6,217.25
Total FICA tax first quarter—Employer’s share = $6,217.25

COMPUTING THE AMOUNT OF STATE UNEMPLOYMENT 
TAX (SUTA) AND FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX (FUTA)
The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), together with state unemployment systems, 
 provides for payments of unemployment compensation to workers who have lost their jobs. 
Most employers are responsible for both a federal and a state unemployment tax.
Generally, an employer can take a credit against the FUTA tax for amounts paid into state 
unemployment funds. These state taxes are commonly known as the State Unemployment 
Tax Act (SUTA). This credit cannot be more than 5.4% of the first $7,000 of employees’ 
 taxable wages.
SUTA tax rates vary from state to state according to the employment record of the 
 company. These merit-rating systems found in many states provide significant SUTA tax 
savings to companies with good employment records.
The FUTA may change from year to year. In this chapter we’ll use a FUTA tax rate  
of .6%. (This assumes an unreduced FUTA tax of 6% for the first $7,000 of wages paid to 
each employee during the year reduced by a 5.4% SUTA credit. That is, 6% −5.4% = .6% 
FUTA tax rate.)

 employees had reached the $7,000 wage base, what is the amount of SUTA and FUTA tax 
the  company must pay?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To calculate the SUTA and FUTA taxes, apply the appropriate tax rates to the gross earnings 
 subject to the tax, in this case, all the gross earnings.
SUTA tax = Gross earnings × 5.4%
SUTA tax = 50,000 × .054 = $2,700
The FUTA tax rate will be .6%. Remember, it is actually 6.0% less the 5.4% credit.
FUTA tax = Gross earnings × .6%

CALCULATING EMPLOYER’S FRINGE  
BENEFIT EXPENSES
In addition to compensating employees with a paycheck, most companies today offer 
employee fringe benefit and services packages. These packages include a wide variety of 
benefits such as pension plans, paid vacations and sick leave, day-care centers, tuition assis-
tance, and health insurance. Corporate executives may receive benefits such as company cars, 
first-class airline travel, and country club memberships. At the executive level of business, 
these benefits are known as perquisites, or perks.
Over the past decade, employee benefits have become increasingly important to workers. 
They have grown in size to the point where today total benefits may cost a company as much 
as 40% to 50% of payroll. Frequently, employees are given a menu of fringe benefits from 
which to choose up to a specified dollar amount. These plans are known as cafeteria style, or 
flexible benefit programs.

given a menu of fringe benefits from which to 
choose up to a specified dollar amount.
STEPS TO CALCULATE EMPLOYER’S FRINGE BENEFITS EXPENSE
STEP 1. If the fringe benefit is a percent of gross payroll, multiply that percent by 
the amount of the gross payroll. If the fringe benefit is a dollar amount per 
employee, multiply that amount by the number of employees.
STEP 2. Find the total fringe benefits by adding all the individual fringe benefit 
amounts.
STEP 3. Calculate the fringe benefit percent by using the percentage formula Rate =
Portion ÷ Base with total fringe benefits as the portion and gross payroll as 
the base (remember to convert your answer to a percent).
Fringe benefit percent = Total fringe benefits

In addition to its gross payroll of $150,000 per month, Premier Distributors, Inc., with 
75 employees, pays 7% of payroll to a retirement fund, 9% for health insurance, and 
$25 per employee for a stock purchase plan.
a. What are the company’s monthly fringe benefit expenses?
b. What percent of payroll does this represent?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
a. To solve for monthly fringe benefits, compute the amount of each benefit and add them to find 
the total.
 
 
Retirement fund expense = Gross payroll × 7%
Retirement fund expense = 150,000 × .07 = $10,500
 
 
Health insurance expense = Gross payroll × 9%
Health insurance expense = 150,000 × .09 = $13,500
 
 
Stock plan expense = Number of employees × $25
Stock plan expense = 75 × 25 = $1,875
 
 
Total fringe benefits = Retirement + Health + Stock
Total fringe benefits = 10,500 + 13,500 + 1,875 = $25,875
b. Fringe benefit percent = Total fringe benefits
Gross payroll
= 25,875
150,000 = .1725 = 17.25%

Although paid vacations and health insurance 
are still the most popular among company-
sponsored benefits, there is a trend today 
toward more “work-life initiatives.” These are 
benefits that help employees balance their 
professional and personal lives, such as child-
care assistance and flexible work hours.

CALCULATING QUARTERLY ESTIMATED 
TAX FOR SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS
By IRS rules, you must pay self-employment tax if you had net earnings of $400 or more 
as a self-employed person. This is income that is not subject to withholding tax. Quarterly 
estimated tax is the method used to pay tax on these earnings. You may pay all of your esti-
mated tax by April or in four equal amounts: in April, June, September, and January of the 
following year.
To calculate the quarterly estimated tax of a self-employed person, we divide the total 
of social security, Medicare, and income tax by 4. (There are 4 quarters in a year.) Internal 
Revenue Service form 1040 ES, Quarterly Estimated Tax Payment Voucher, Exhibit 9-5, is 
used to file this tax with the IRS each quarter.
Quarterly estimated tax = Social security + Medicare + Income tax

BUSINESS DECISION: NEW FRINGE BENEFITS
14. You are the Human Resource Manager for Sunlink International, a cellular phone company 
with 800 employees. Top management has asked you to implement three additional fringe 
 benefits that were negotiated with employee representatives and agreed upon by a majority 
of the  employees. These include group term life insurance, a group legal services plan, and a 
 wellness center.
 
The life insurance is estimated to cost $260 per employee per quarter. The legal plan will 
cost $156 semiannually per employee. The company will contribute 40% to the life insurance 
 premium and 75% to the cost of the legal services plan. The employees will pay the balance 
through payroll deductions from their biweekly paychecks. In addition, they will be charged 1
4% 
of their gross earnings per paycheck for maintaining the wellness center. The company will pay 
the initial cost of $500,000 to build the center. This expense will be spread over 5 years.
a. What total amount should be deducted per paycheck for these new fringe benefits for an 
employee earning $41,600 per year?
 
b. What is the total annual cost of the new fringe benefits to Sunlink?
 
 
 
 
Human Resource managers  
handle or oversee all aspects of 
human resources work. Typical 
areas of responsibility include 
unemployment compensation, 
fringe benefits, training, and 
employee relations. They held 
about 904,900 jobs in 2008, with 
median annual earnings of $96,130. 
The middle 50% earned between 
$73,480 and $126,050.

An hourly wage is the amount an employee is 
paid for each hour worked.
Regular time specifies that a standard work 
week is 40 hours.
Overtime amounting to at least time-and-a-half  
must be paid for all hours over 40. Some 
employers pay double time for weekend, holiday, 
and midnight shifts.
Regular pay = Hourly rate × Hours worked
Overtime pay = Hourly rate × Overtime
factor × Hours worked
Total  gross pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Sami Brady earns $9.50 per hour as a 
supervisor in a plant. If her overtime rate is 
time-and-a-half and holidays are double time, 
what is Sami’s total gross pay for working 
49 hours last week, including 4 holiday hours?
Regular pay = 9.50 × 40 = $380.00
Time-and-a-half pay =
9.50 × 1.5 × 5 = $71.25
Double-time pay = 9.50 × 2 × 4 = $76.00
Total gross pay =
 380.00 + 71.25 + 76.00 = $527.25

Page 265
A piecework pay rate schedule is based on 
production output, not time. Straight piecework 
pays the worker a certain amount of pay per 
unit regardless of quantity. In differential 
piecework, the rate per unit increases as output 
quantity goes up.
Total gross pay = Output quantity ×
Rate per unit  
 
Chemical Labs pays its workers $2.50 per 
unit of production. What is the gross pay of a 
worker producing 233 units?
Gross pay = 233 × 2.50 = $582.50

workers $0.54 per unit up to 5,000 units and

and Incremental Commission
1FSGPSNBODF0CKFDUJWF 
Page 267
Commission is a method of compensation 
primarily used to pay employees who sell goods 
and services. Straight commission is based  
on a single specified percentage of the sales 
volume attained. Incremental commission, like 
differential piecework, is when various levels of 
sales earn increasing rates of commission.
Total gross pay = Total sales × Commission
rate  
 
Horizon Products pays 4% straight  
commission on all sales. What is the gross  
pay of an employee who sells $135,000?
Gross pay = 135,000 × .04 = $5,400
Discovery Imports pays incremental commissions 
of 3.5% on sales up to $100,000 and 4.5% on 
all sales greater than $100,000. What is the gross 
pay of an employee selling $164,000?

Salary plus commission is a pay schedule 
whereby the employee receives a guaranteed 
salary in addition to a commission on sales over  
a specified amount.
An employee is paid a salary of $350 per  
week plus a 2% commission on sales greater  
than $8,000. If he sold $13,400 last week, 
how much did he earn?

Self-employed persons are responsible for social 
security and Medicare taxes at twice the rate 
deducted for employees. Technically, they are the 
employee and the employer; therefore, they must 
pay both shares, as follows:
Social Security
12.4% (6.2% × 2), wage base $113,700

Page 285
SUTA and FUTA taxes provide for unemploy-
ment compensation to workers who have lost 
their jobs. These taxes are paid by the employer. 
The SUTA tax rate is 5.4% of the first $7,000 
of earnings per year by each employee. The 
FUTA tax rate used in this chapter is 6.0% 
of the first $7,000 minus the SUTA tax paid 
(6.0% −5.4% = 0.6%).
Trans Lux, Inc., had a total payroll of  
$40,000 last month. If none of the employees 
has reached the $7,000 wage base, what is the 
amount of SUTA and FUTA tax due?
SUTA = 40,000 × 5.4% = $2,160
FUTA = 40,000 × .6% = $240

9. Social security tax = Gross earnings × 6.2%
Social security tax = 5,000 × .062 = $310
Medicare tax = Gross earnings × 1.45%
Medicare tax = 5,000 × .0145 = $72.50
10. Earnings subject to tax = Wage base −Year-to-date earnings
Earnings subject to tax = 113,700 −109,200 = $4,500
Social security tax = Earnings subject to tax × 6.2%
Social security tax = 4,500 × .062 = $279.00
11. From Exhibit 9-1
Withholding allowance = 1 allowance × Exemptions
Withholding allowance = $325.00 × 5 = $1,625
Taxable income = Gross pay −Withholding allowance
Taxable income = 5,670 −1,625 = $4,045.00
From Exhibit 9-2, Table 4(b):
Category $2,179 to $6,733
Withholding Tax = 148.70 + 15% of amount greater than $2,179
Withholding Tax = 148.70 + .15(4,045 −2,179)
Withholding Tax = 148.70 + .15(1,866)

12. From Exhibit 9-3
$835 Weekly, married, 2 allowances = $125.88
13. 12 employees @ $350
Social security = 350 × .062 = 21.70
Medicare = 350 × .0145 = 5.08
Total FICA per employee = 21.70 + 5.08 = $26.78
Total FICA per week = 26.78 × 12 employees = $321.36
Total FICA per quarter = 321.36 × 13 weeks = $4,177.68
6 employees @ $425
Social security = 425 × .062 = 26.35
Medicare = 425 × .0145 = 6.16
Total FICA per employee = 26.35 + 6.16 = $32.51
Total FICA per week = 32.51 × 6 employees = $195.06
Total FICA per quarter = 195.06 × 13 weeks = $2,535.78
Total FICA per quarter:
Employees’ share = 4,177.68 + 2,535.78 = $6,713.46
Employer’s  share = 4,177.68 + 2,535.78 = $6,713.46

Medicare = 60,000 × .029 = $1,740
15. SUTA tax = Gross earnings × 5.4%
SUTA tax = 10,000 × .054 = $540
FUTA tax = Gross earnings × .6%
FUTA tax = 10,000 × .006 = $60
16. a. Fringe benefits
Sick days = Gross payroll × 5%
Sick days = 123,400 × .05 = $6,170
Health insurance = Gross payroll × 8%
Health insurance = 123,400 × .08 = $9,872
Dental insurance = Number of employees × 12.40
Dental insurance = 250 × 12.40 = $3,100
Total fringe benefits = 6,170 + 9,872 + 3,100 = $19,142
b. Fringe benefit percent = Total fringe benefit
Gross payroll
Fringe benefit percent = 19,142
123,400 = .155 = 15.5%
c. Yearly fringe benefits = Weekly total × 52
Yearly fringe benefits = 19,142 × 52 = $995,384

Electronic commerce, commonly known as  e-commerce or e-business, 
consists of the  buying and selling of products and services over the 
Internet. Electronic commerce that is  conducted between businesses is 
referred to as  business-to-business, or B2B. Electronic  commerce that 
is  conducted between businesses and  consumers, on the other hand, 
is referred to as  business-to-consumer, or B2C.
Online retailers are sometimes known as e-tailers, and online 
retail is referred to as e-tail. Today most big retailers have an electronic 
 commerce presence on the Internet.

Mobile commerce, also known as m-commerce, is the ability to 
conduct commerce using a mobile device, such as a mobile phone, a 
personal digital assistant (PDA), or a smartphone.
Mobile commerce began in 1997 when the first two mobile-
phone-enabled Coca Cola  vending machines were installed in the 
Helsinki area in Finland. The machines accepted payment via SMS 
text messages. The first banking service based on mobile phones was 
launched in 1997 by Merita Bank of Finland, also using SMS.

UNDERSTANDING AND COMPUTING SIMPLE INTEREST
The practice of borrowing and lending money dates back in history for thousands of years. 
Today institutions such as banks, savings and loans, and credit unions are specifically in busi-
ness to borrow and lend money. They constitute a significant portion of the service sector of 
the American economy.
Interest is the rental fee charged by a lender to a business or an individual for the use of 
money. The amount of interest charged is determined by three factors: the amount of money 
being borrowed or invested, known as the principal; the percent of interest charged on the 
money per year, known as the rate; and the length of time of the loan, known as time. The 
manner in which the interest is computed is an additional factor that influences the amount 
of interest. The two most commonly used methods in business today for computing interest 
are simple and compound.
Simple interest means that the interest is calculated only once for the entire time period 
of the loan. At the end of the time period, the borrower repays the principal plus the interest. 
Simple interest loans are usually made for short periods of time, such as a few days, weeks, 
or months. Compound interest means that the interest is calculated more than once during the 
time period of the loan. When compound interest is applied to a loan, each succeeding time 
period accumulates interest on the previous interest in addition to interest on the principal. 
Compound interest loans are generally for time periods of a year or longer.
This chapter discusses the concepts of simple interest; simple discount, which is a varia-
tion of a simple interest loan; and promissory notes. Chapter 11 covers the concepts and 
calculations related to compound interest and present value.
COMPUTING SIMPLE INTEREST FOR LOANS 
WITH TERMS OF YEARS OR MONTHS
Simple interest is calculated by using a formula known as the simple interest formula. It is 
stated as
Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
I = PRT
When using the simple interest formula, the time factor, T, must be expressed in years 
or a fraction of a year.
4*.1-&*/5&3&45'03.6-"Ū:&"3403.0/5)4
Years
When the time period of a loan is a year or longer, use the number of years as the time factor, 
converting fractional parts to decimals. For example, the time factor for a 2-year loan is 2, 
3 years is 3, 11
2 years is 1.5, 4 3
4 years is 4.75, and so on.
Months
When the time period of a loan is for a specified number of months, express the time factor 
as a fraction of a year. The number of months is the numerator, and 12 months (1 year) is the 
denominator. A loan for 1 month would have a time factor of 1
12; a loan for 2 months would 
have a factor of 2
12, or 1
6; a 5-month loan would use 5
12 as the factor; a loan for 18 months would 
use 18

CALCULATING SIMPLE INTEREST FOR LOANS WITH TERMS OF DAYS 
BY USING THE EXACT INTEREST AND ORDINARY INTEREST METHODS
There are two methods for calculating the time factor, T, when applying the simple interest 
formula using days. Because time must be expressed in years, loans whose terms are given 
in days must be made into a fractional part of a year. This is done by dividing the days of a 
loan by the number of days in a year.
4*.1-&*/5&3&45'03.6-"Ū%":4
Exact Interest
The first method for calculating the time factor is known as exact interest. Exact interest uses 
365 days as the time factor denominator. This method is used by government agencies, the 
Federal Reserve Bank, and most credit unions.
Time = Number of days of a loan

To solve this problem, we apply the simple interest formula:
Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
Interest = 8,000 × 9% × 1
Interest = 8,000 × .09 × 1
Interest = $720
b. What is the amount of interest for a loan of $16,500 at 12 1

Ordinary Interest
The second method for calculating the time factor is known as ordinary interest. Ordinary 
interest uses 360 days as the denominator of the time factor. This method dates back to the 
time before electronic calculators and computers. In the past, when calculating the time factor 
manually, a denominator of 360 was easier to use than 365.
Regardless of today’s electronic sophistication, banks and most other lending institutions 
still use ordinary interest because it yields a somewhat higher amount of interest than does the 
exact interest method. Over the years, ordinary interest has become known as the banker’s rule.
Time = Number of days of a loan

CALCULATING THE MATURITY  
VALUE OF A LOAN
When the time period of a loan is over, the loan is said to mature. At that time, the borrower 
repays the original principal plus the interest. The total payback of principal and interest is 
known as the maturity value of a loan. Once the interest has been calculated, the maturity 
value can be found by using the formula:
Maturity value = Principal + Interest
MV = P + I
For example, if a loan for $50,000 had interest of $8,600, the maturity value would be 
found by adding the principal and the interest: 50,000 + 8,600 = $58,600.
Maturity value can also be calculated directly without first calculating the interest by 
using the following formula:
Maturity value = Principal(1 + Rate × Time)
MV = P(1 + RT )
10-3
maturity value The total payback of principal 
and interest of an investment or a loan.

What is the maturity value of a loan for $25,000 at 11% for 2 1
2 years?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Because this example asks for the maturity value, not the amount of interest, we will use the 
formula for finding maturity value directly, MV = P(1 + RT ). Remember to multiply the rate 
and time first, then add the 1. Note that the time, 2 1
2 years, should be converted to the decimal 
equivalent 2.5 for ease in calculation.
Maturity value = Principal(1 + Rate × Time)
Maturity value = 25,000(1 + .11 × 2.5)
Maturity value = 25,000(1 + .275)
Maturity value = 25,000(1.275)
Maturity value = $31,875

USING THE SIMPLE INTEREST FORMULA
In Section I, we used the simple interest formula, I = PRT, to solve for the interest. Frequently 
in business, however, the principal, rate, or time might be the unknown factor. Remember 
from Chapter 5 that an equation can be solved for any of the variables by isolating that vari-
able to one side of the equation. In this section, we convert the simple interest formula to 
equations that solve for each of the other variable factors.
If you find this procedure difficult to remember, use the magic triangle, as we did in 
Chapter 6, to calculate the portion, rate, and base. Remember, to use the Magic Triangle,

BUSINESS DECISION: COMPETING BANKS
48. You are the accounting manager for Kool Ragz, Inc., a manufacturer of men’s and women’s 
clothing. The company needs to borrow $1,800,000 for 90 days in order to purchase a large 
quantity of material at “closeout” prices. The interest rate for such loans at your bank, Rimrock 
Bank, is 11% using ordinary interest.
a. What is the amount of interest on this loan?
b. After making a few “shopping” calls, you find that Southside National Bank will lend at 
11% using exact interest. What is the amount of interest on this offer?
c. So that you can keep your business, Rimrock Bank has offered a loan at 10.5% using 
 ordinary interest. What is the amount of interest on this offer?
d. (Challenge) If Southside National wants to beat Rimrock’s last offer (part c) by  charging 
$1,250 less interest, what rate, rounded to the nearest hundredths of a percent, must it quote 
using exact interest?
There are approximately 7,000  commercial 
banks in the United States. Roughly 25%  
of these banks have assets in excess of 
$300 million.

SOLVING FOR THE RATE 
When we solve the simple formula for rate, the answer will be a decimal that must be con-
verted to a percent. In business, interest rates are always expressed as a percent.
When the rate is the unknown variable, we isolate the R on one side of the equation by 
dividing both sides of the equation by PT. This yields the new equation:
Rate =
Interest
Principal × Time
R = I

SOLVING FOR THE TIME 
When solving the simple interest formula for time, a whole number in the answer represents 
years and a decimal represents a portion of a year. The decimal should be converted to days 
by multiplying it by 360 for ordinary interest or by 365 for exact interest. Lending institutions 
consider any part of a day to be a full day. Therefore, any fraction of a day is rounded up to 
the next higher day even if it is less than .5.
For example, an answer of 3 means 3 years. An answer of 3.22 means 3 years and .22 of 
the next year. Assuming ordinary interest, multiply the decimal portion of the answer, .22, by 
360. This gives 79.2, which represents the number of days. The total time of the loan would 
be 3 years and 80 days. Remember to always round up any fraction of a day.
When using the simple interest formula to solve for time, T, we isolate the T on one side 
of the equation by dividing both sides of the equation by PR. This yields the new equation:
Time = 
 Interest
Principal × Rate
T =  I

CALCULATING LOANS INVOLVING PARTIAL 
PAYMENTS BEFORE MATURITY
Frequently, businesses and individuals who have borrowed money for a specified length of 
time find that they want to save some interest by making one or more partial payments on 
the loan before the maturity date. The most commonly used method for this calculation is 
known as the U.S. rule. The rule states that when a partial payment is made on a loan, the 
payment is first used to pay off the accumulated interest to date and the balance is used to 
reduce the principal. In this application, the ordinary interest method (360 days) will be used 
for all calculations.

STEPS
  FOR CALCULATING MATURITY VALUE OF A LOAN AFTER  
ONE OR MORE PARTIAL PAYMENTS
45&1 Using the simple interest formula with ordinary interest, compute the amount 
of interest due from the date of the loan to the date of the partial payment.
45&1 Subtract the interest from Step 1 from the partial payment. This pays the inter-
est to date.
45&1 Subtract the balance of the partial payment after Step 2 from the original prin-
cipal of the loan. This gives the adjusted principal.
45&1 If another partial payment is made, repeat Steps 1, 2, and 3 using the adjusted 
principal and the number of days since the last partial payment.
45&1 The maturity value is computed by adding the interest since the last partial 
payment to the adjusted principal.

Remember to use ordinary interest, 360 
days, for all calculations involving partial 
payments.

Ray Windsor borrowed $10,000 at 9% interest for 120 days. On day 30, Ray made a 
 partial payment of $2,000. On day 70, he made a second partial payment of $3,000. 
What is the maturity value of the loan after the partial payments?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. Compute the interest from the date of the loan to the partial payment. In this problem, 
the first partial payment was made on day 30.
I = PRT
I = 10,000 × .09 × 30
360
I = $75
 = 75
Step 2. Subtract the interest from the partial payment.
$2,000 Partial payment
−
75 Accumulated interest
$1,925 Amount of partial payment left to reduce the principal
Step 3. Reduce the principal.
$10,000 Original principal
−  1,925 Amount of partial payment used to reduce principal
$8,075 Adjusted principal
Step 4. A second partial payment of $3,000 was made on day 70. We now repeat Steps 1, 2, 
and 3 to credit the second partial payment properly. Remember, use the adjusted prin-
cipal and 40 days (70 − 30 = 40) for this calculation.
Step 1. 
I = PRT
I = $8,075 × .09 × 40

I = $80.75 Accumulated interest since last partial payment
Step 2.

Step 5. Once all partial payments have been credited, we find the maturity value of the loan 
by calculating the interest due from the last partial payment to the maturity date and 
adding it to the last adjusted principal.
Note: The last partial payment was made on day 70 of the loan; therefore, 50 days 
remain on the loan (120 −70 = 50 days).
I = PRT
I = $5,155.75 × .09 × 50

Collateral is a borrower’s pledge of specific 
property, such as a car, a boat, or a home, 
to a lender to secure repayment of a loan. 
Collateral serves as protection for a lender 
against a borrower’s risk of default.
If a borrower defaults on a loan, that 
borrower forfeits (gives up) the property 
pledged as collateral—and the lender 
then becomes the owner of the collateral. 
In a typical mortgage loan transaction, for 
instance, the real estate that is acquired 
with the help of the loan serves as 
collateral.

UNDERSTANDING PROMISSORY NOTES
AND DISCOUNTING
Technically, the document that states the details of a loan and is signed by the borrower is 
known as a promissory note. Promissory means it is a promise to pay the principal back to 
the lender on a certain date. Note means that the document is a negotiable instrument and 
can be transferred or sold to others not involved in the original loan. Much like a check, with 
proper endorsement by the payee, the note can be transferred to another person, company, or 
lending institution.
Promissory notes are either noninterest-bearing or interest-bearing. When a note is 
 noninterest-bearing, the maturity value equals the principal because there is no interest being 
charged. With interest-bearing notes, the maturity value equals the principal plus the interest.
Exhibit 10-2 is an example of a typical promissory note with its parts labeled. Notice the 
similarity between a note and a check. A list explaining the labels follows.
Maker: The person or company borrowing the money and issuing the note.
Payee: The person or institution lending the money and receiving the payment.
Term: The time period of the note, usually stated in days. (Use ordinary interest.)
Date: The date that the note is issued.
Face Value or Principal: The amount of money borrowed.
Interest Rate: The annual rate of interest being charged.
Maturity Date or Due Date: The date when maturity value is due the payee.
SECTION  III 10
promissory note A debt instrument in which 
one party agrees to repay money to another 
within a specified period of time. Promissory 
notes may be noninterest-bearing at no interest 
or interest-bearing at a specified rate of interest.

CALCULATING BANK DISCOUNT AND PROCEEDS  
FOR A SIMPLE DISCOUNT NOTE
To this point, we have been dealing with simple interest notes in which the interest was added 
to the principal to determine the maturity value. Another way of lending money is to deduct 
the interest from the principal at the beginning of the loan and give the borrower the differ-
ence. These are known as simple discount notes. When this method is used, the amount of 
interest charged is known as the bank discount and the amount that the borrower receives is 
known as the proceeds. When the term of the note is over, the borrower will repay the entire 
principal, or face value, of the note as the maturity value.
For example, Julie goes to a bank and signs a simple interest note for $5,000. If the inter-
est charge amounts to $500, she will receive $5,000 at the beginning of the note and repay 
$5,500 on maturity of the note. If the bank used a simple discount note for Julie’s loan, the 
bank discount (interest) would be deducted from the face value (principal). Julie’s proceeds 
on the loan would be $4,500, and on maturity she would pay $5,000.
#"/,%*4$06/5
Because bank discount is the same as interest, we use the formula I = PRT as before, substi-
tuting bank discount for interest, face value for principal, and discount rate for interest rate. 
Note: Use ordinary interest, 360 days, for simple discount notes whose terms are stated in days.
Bank discount = Face value × Discount rate × Time
PROCEEDS
The proceeds of a note are calculated using the following formula:
Proceeds = Face value −Bank discount

CHAPTER 10 tSIMPLE INTEREST AND PROMISSORY NOTES
CALCULATING TRUE, OR EFFECTIVE, RATE  
OF INTEREST FOR A SIMPLE DISCOUNT NOTE
In a simple interest note, the borrower receives the full face value, whereas with a simple 
discount note, the borrower receives only the proceeds. Because the proceeds are less than the 
face value, the stated discount rate is not the true or actual interest rate of the note.
To protect the consumer, the U.S. Congress has passed legislation requiring all lending 
 institutions to quote the true, or effective, interest rate for all loans. Effective interest rate is calcu-
lated by substituting the bank discount for interest and the proceeds for principal in the rate formula,
Effective interest rate =
Bank discount
Proceeds × Time
 10-11 
true, or effective, interest rate The actual 
interest rate charged on a discounted note. 
Takes into account the fact that the  borrower 
does not receive the full amount of the 
principal.

INTEREST RATE
What is the effective interest rate of a simple discount note for $10,000 at a bank  discount 
rate of 14% for a period of 90 days? Round to the nearest tenth of a percent.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To find the effective interest rate, we must first calculate the amount of the bank discount and the 
proceeds of the note, then substitute these numbers in the effective interest rate formula.
Step 1. Bank Discount
Bank discount = Face value × Discount rate × Time
Bank discount = $10,000 × .14 × 90
360
Bank discount = $350
Step 2. Proceeds
Proceeds = Face value −Bank discount
Proceeds = 10,000 −350
Proceeds = $9,650
Step 3. Effective Interest Rate
Effective interest rate =
Bank discount

DISCOUNTING NOTES BEFORE MATURITY

may take the note to a bank and sell it. This is a convenient way for a company or individual 
to cash in a note at any time before maturity. This process is known as discounting a note.
When a note is discounted at a bank, the original payee receives the proceeds of the dis-
counted note and the bank (the new payee) receives the maturity value of the note when it 
matures. The time period used to calculate the proceeds is from the date the note is discounted 
to the maturity date. This is known as the discount period.
Exhibit 10-3 illustrates the timeline for a 90-day simple interest note discounted on the 
60th day.

company or an individual can cash in or sell

STEPS FOR DISCOUNTING A NOTE BEFORE MATURITY
STEP 1. Calculate the maturity value of the note. If the original note was noninterest-
bearing, the maturity value will be the same as the face value. If the original 
note was interest-bearing, the maturity value should be calculated as usual:
Maturity value = Principal11 + Rate × Time2
STEP 2. Determine the number of days or months of the discount period. The discount 
period is used as the numerator of the time in Step 3.
STEP 3. Calculate the amount of the bank discount by using the following formula. 
Note: Use ordinary interest, 360 days, for discounting a note before maturity, 
when the terms are stated in days.
Bank discount = Maturity value × Discount rate × Time
STEP 4. Calculate the proceeds of the note by using the formula:
Proceeds = Maturity value −Bank discount

Continental Industries received a $15,000 promissory note for 150 days at 12%
 simple interest from one of its customers. After 90 days, Continental needed cash, so it 
 discounted the note at the InterAmerican Bank at a discount rate of 14%. What are the 
proceeds Continental will receive from the discounted note?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. Calculate the maturity value of the original note:
Maturity value = Principal11 + Rate × Time2
Maturity value = 15,000a1 + .12 × 150
360b
Maturity value = 15,000(1 + .05) = 15,000(1.05)
Maturity value = $15,750
Step 2. Find the number of days of the discount period: In this example, the note was 
 discounted after 90 days of a 150-day note; therefore, the discount period is 60 days 
(150 −90 = 60).

CHAPTER 10 tSIMPLE INTEREST AND PROMISSORY NOTES
PURCHASING U.S. TREASURY BILLS
U.S. Treasury bills, or T-bills, are short-term government securities with maturities of 4 weeks, 
13 weeks, and 26 weeks. Sold by banks, brokers, and dealers in increments of $1,000, these 
securities represent loans to the U.S. government and are considered to be among the  safest 
of investments. Just like discounted bank notes, T-bills are sold at a discount from their 
face value.
For example, you might pay $970 for a T-bill with a face value of $1,000. When the bill 
matures, you would be paid its face value, $1,000. Your interest is the difference between the 
face value and the purchase price—in this example, $30. The interest is determined by the 
discount rate, which is set when the bills are initially auctioned by the U.S. Treasury.
When comparing T-bills to discounted bank notes, the interest of a T-bill is the equivalent 
of the bank discount of a note; the face value of a T-bill is the equivalent of the proceeds of 
a note. Use the following formulas for T-bill calculations:
Interest = Face value × Discount rate × Time
   Purchase price = Face value −Interest
Effective interest rate =
 Interest
Purchase price × Time

Step 3. Calculate the amount of the bank discount:
Bank discount = Maturity value × Discount rate × Time
Bank discount = $15,750 × .14 × 60

Bank discount = $367.50
Step 4. Calculate the proceeds of the discounted note:
Proceeds = Maturity value −Bank discount
Proceeds = $15,750.00 −$367.50

Calculating Simple Interest  
for Loans with Terms of Days by 
Using the Ordinary Interest Method
Performance Objective 10-2,  
Page 307
Ordinary interest uses 360 days as the time 
factor denominator.
Time (ordinary) = Number of days of a loan
360
Using the ordinary interest method, what is 
the amount of interest on a loan of $8,000 at 
9% for 120 days?
I = PRT
I = 8,000 × .09 × 120

Interest = $240
Calculating the Maturity  
Value of a Loan
Performance Objective 10-3,  
Page 308
When the time period of a loan is over, the loan 
is said to mature. The total payback of principal 
and interest is known as the maturity value of a 
loan.
Maturity value = Principal + Interest
Maturity value = Principal(1 + Rate × Time)
What is the maturity value of a loan for 
$50,000 at 12% interest for 3 years?
MV = 50,00011 + .12 × 32
MV = 50,00011.362
Maturity value = $68,000
Calculating the Number of  
Days of a Loan
Performance Objective 10-4,  
Page 309
1. Determine the number of days remaining in 
the first month by subtracting the loan date 
from the number of days in that month.
2. List the number of days for each succeeding 
whole month.
3. List the number of loan days in the 
last month.
4. Add the days from Steps 1, 2, and 3.
Steve Adams borrowed money from the 
Republic Bank on May 5 and repaid the loan 
on August 19. For how many days was this 
loan?
May 31
−May 5
26 Days in May
61 June−July
+19 August

Determining the Maturity  
Date of a Loan
Performance Objective 10-5,  
Page 310
1. Determine the number of days remaining in 
the first month.
2. Subtract days from Step 1 from number of 
days in the loan.
3. Subtract days in each succeeding whole 
month until you reach a month in which the 
difference is less than the days in that month. 
The maturity date will be the day of that 
month that corresponds to the difference.
What is the maturity date of a loan taken out 
on June 9 for 100 days?
June  30
  100 Days of the loan
June −9
− 21 Days in June
21 Days in June
79
− 31 Days in July
48
− 31 Days in August
17
At this point, the difference, 17, is less than 
the days in September; therefore, the maturity 
date is September 17.

Principal =
Interest
Rate × Time
Kye Morrow borrowed money at 10% 
 interest for 2 years. If the interest charge was 
$800, how much principal did Kye borrow?
Principal =
800
.10 × 2 = 800
.2
Principal = $4,000
Solving for the Rate
Performance Objective 10-7,  
Page 314
Rate =

Principal × Time
Arnold Parker borrowed $3,000 for 75 
days. If the interest was $90 using ordinary 
interest, what was the rate on Arnold’s loan?
Rate =
90
3,000 × 75
360
= 90
625
Rate = .144 = 14.4%
Solving for the Time
Performance Objective 10-8,  
Page 315
When solving for time, whole numbers are 
years and decimals are multiplied by 360 or 
365 to get days. Any fraction of a day should 
be rounded up to the next higher day because 
lending institutions consider any portion of a 
day to be another day.
Time =
Interest
Principal × Rate
What is the time period of a loan for $20,000 
at 9% ordinary interest if the amount of 
interest is $1,000?
Time =
1,000
20,000 × .09
= 1,000
1,800
= .555555
Time = .555555 × 360 = 199.99 = 200 Days
Calculating Loans Involving Partial 
Payments before  
Maturity
Performance Objective 10-9,  
Page 316
1. Using the simple interest formula with 
ordinary interest, compute the amount of 
interest due from the date of the loan to 
the date of the partial payment.
2. Subtract the interest from Step 1 from the 
partial payment. This pays the interest to 
date.
3. Subtract the balance of the partial 
payment after Step 2 from the original 
principal of the loan. This gives the 
adjusted principal.
4. If another partial payment is made, repeat 
Steps 1, 2, and 3 using the adjusted 
 principal and the number of days since 
the last partial payment.
5. The maturity value is computed by  adding 
the interest since the last partial  payment 
to the adjusted principal.
Sue Williams borrowed $7,000 at 10% 
ordinary interest for 120 days. On day 90, 
Sue made a partial payment of $3,000. What 
was the new maturity value of the loan?

Section III: Understanding Promissory Notes and Discounting
Topic
Important Concepts
Illustrative Examples
Calculating Bank Discount and 
Proceeds for a Simple Discount 
Note
Performance Objective 10-10, 
Page 323
With discounting, the interest, known as the bank 
discount, is deducted from the face value of the 
loan. The borrower gets the difference, known as 
the proceeds.
Bank discount =
Face value × Discount rate × Time
Proceeds = Face value −Bank discount
What are the bank discount and proceeds of a 
$10,000 note discounted at 12% for 6 months?
Bank discount = 10,000 × .12 × 6
12
Bank discount = $600
Proceeds = 10,000 −600 = $9,400
Calculating True, or Effective, Rate 
of Interest for a Simple Discount 
Note
Performance Objective 10-11,  
Page 324
Because the proceeds are less than the face value 
of a loan, the true, or effective, interest rate is 
higher than the stated bank discount rate.
Effective  interest rate =
Bank discount
Proceeds × Time
What is the effective rate of a simple discount 
note for $20,000 at a bank discount of 15% 
for a period of 9 months?
Bank discount = FV × R × T
Bank discount = 20,000 × .15 × 9
12
Bank discount = $2,250
Proceeds = Face value −Bank discount
Proceeds = 20,000 −2,250
Proceeds = $17,750
Effective interest rate =
2,250
17,750 × 9
12
Effective interest rate = 16.9%
Discounting Notes before Maturity
Performance Objective 10-12, 
Page 324
Frequently, companies extend credit to their 
customers by accepting short-term promissory 
notes as payment for goods or services. These 
notes can be cashed in early by discounting them 
at a bank and receiving the proceeds.
1. Calculate the maturity value.
MV = P(1 + RT )
2. Determine the discount period.
3. Calculate the bank discount.
Bank discount = MV × R × T
4. Calculate the proceeds.
Proceeds = MV −Bank discount
Reliable Food Wholesalers received a $100,000 
promissory note for 6 months at 11% interest 
from SuperSaver Supermarkets. If Reliable 
discounts the note after 4 months at a discount 
rate of 15%, what proceeds will it receive?
MV = 100,000a1 + .11 × 6
12b
MV = $105,500
Discount period = 2 months (6 – 4)
Bank discount = 105,500 × .15 × 2
12
Bank discount = $2,637.50
Proceeds = 105,500.00 −2,637.50
Proceeds = $102,862.50
Purchasing U.S. Treasury Bills
Performance Objective 10-13, 
Page 326
U.S. Treasury bills, or T-bills, are short-term 
government securities with maturities of 4 weeks, 
13 weeks, and 26 weeks. Sold by banks, brokers, 
and dealers in increments of $1,000, these 
securities represent loans to the U.S. government. 
Just like discounted bank notes, T-bills are sold at 
a discount from their face value.
Interest = Face value × Discount rate × Time
Purchase price = Face value −Interest
Effective  interest rate =
Interest
Purchase price × Time
Cindy Lane purchased $3,000 in U.S. 
Treasury bills with a discount rate of 5% for 
a period of 26 weeks.
a. How much interest did Cindy earn on the 
T-bill investment?
Interest = 3,000 × .05 × 26
52 = $75
b. How much was the purchase price of 
Cindy’s T-bills?
Purchase price = 3,000 −75 = $2,925
c. What was the effective interest rate of 
Cindy’s T-bill investment? Round to the 
nearest hundredth of a percent.
Effective interest rate =
75
2,925 × 26

COMPOUND INTEREST—THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
In Chapter 10, we studied simple interest in which the formula I = PRT was applied once during 
the term of a loan or an investment to find the amount of interest. In business, another common 
way of calculating interest is by using a method known as compounding, or  compound interest, in 
which the interest calculation is applied a number of times during the term of the loan or investment.
Compound interest yields considerably higher interest than simple interest does because 
the investor is earning interest on the interest. With compound interest, the interest earned 
for each period is reinvested or added to the previous principal before the next calculation 
or compounding. The previous principal plus interest then becomes the new principal for 
the next period. For example, $100 invested at 8% interest is worth $108 after the first year 
($100 principal + $8 interest). If the interest is not withdrawn, the interest for the next period 
will be calculated based on $108 principal.
As this compounding process repeats itself each period, the principal keeps growing by 
the amount of the previous interest. As the number of compounding periods increases, the 
amount of interest earned grows dramatically, especially when compared with simple inter-
est, as illustrated in Exhibit 11-1.
This chapter introduces you to an all-important business concept, the time value of 
money. Consider this: If you were owed $1,000, would you rather have it now or 1 year 
from now? If you answered “now,” you already have a feeling for the concept. Money “now,” 
compound interest Interest that is applied 
a number of times during the term of a loan or 
an investment. Interest paid on principal and 
 previously earned interest.
time value of money The idea that money 
“now,” or in the present, is more desirable than the 
same amount of money in the future because it 
can be invested and earn interest as time goes by.

The growth of an investment may vary greatly depending on whether simple or
compound interest is involved. For example, the chart below shows the growth of $1,000 
invested in an account paying 10% annual simple interest versus the same amount 
invested in an account paying 10% annual compound interest. As this chart shows, 
compound interest yields more than four times the value generated by simple interest 
over 30 years.

or in the present, is more desirable than the same amount of money in the future because it 
can be invested and earn interest as time goes by.
In this chapter, you learn to calculate the compound amount (future value) of an invest-
ment at compound interest when the present amount (present value) is known. You also 
learn to calculate the present value that must be deposited now at compound interest to yield 
a known future amount. (See Exhibit 11-2.)
MANUALLY CALCULATING COMPOUND AMOUNT 
(FUTURE VALUE) AND COMPOUND INTEREST
Compounding divides the time of a loan or an investment into compounding periods or sim-
ply periods. To manually calculate the compound amount or future value of an investment, 
we must compound or calculate the interest as many times as there are compounding periods 
at the interest rate per period.
For example, an investment made for 5 years at 6% compounded annually (once per year) 
would have five compounding periods (5 years × 1 period per year), each at 6%. If the same 
investment was compounded semiannually (two times per year), there would be 10 compound-
ing periods (5 years × 2 periods per year), each at 3% (6% annual rate ÷ 2 periods per year).
The amount of compound interest is calculated by subtracting the principal from the 
compound amount.
Compound interest = Compound amount −Principal

Present Value and Future Value at Compound Interest
a. Katie Trotta invested $20,000 in a passbook savings account at 5% interest compounded 
annually for 2 years. Manually calculate the compound amount of the investment and the total 
amount of compound interest Katie earned.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To solve this compound interest problem manually, we must apply the simple interest formula 
twice because there are two compounding periods (2 years × 1 period per year). Note how the 
interest from the first period is reinvested or added to the original principal to earn interest in the 
second period.

COMPUTING COMPOUND AMOUNT (FUTURE VALUE) AND 
COMPOUND INTEREST BY USING COMPOUND INTEREST TABLES
You do not have to work many compound interest problems manually, particularly those 
with numerous compounding periods, before you start wishing for an easier way! In actual-
ity, there are two other methods for solving compound interest problems. The first uses a 
compound interest formula, and the second uses compound interest tables.
The compound interest formula, A = P(1 + i)n, contains an exponent and therefore 
requires the use of a calculator with an exponential function key. The use of the compound 
interest formula is covered in Performance Objective 11-5.
A compound interest table, such as Table 11-1 on page 345, is a useful set of factors 
that represent the future values of $1 at various interest rates for a number of compounding 
periods. Because these factors are based on $1, the future values of other principal amounts 
are found by multiplying the appropriate table factor by the number of dollars of principal.

b. Manually recalculate the compound amount and compound interest from the previous example 
by using semiannual compounding (two times per year). How much more interest would Katie 
earn if the bank offered semiannual compounding?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To solve this compound interest problem, we must apply the simple interest formula four times 
because there are four compounding periods (2 years × 2 periods per year). Note that the time 
factor is now 6
12, or 1
2, because semiannual compounding means every 6 months.

Compounding Periods per Year
Compound amount (future value) = Table factor × Principal
To use the compound interest tables, we must know the number of compounding periods 
and the interest rate per period. Exhibit 11-3 above shows the various compounding options 
and the corresponding number of periods per year. Note: The greater the number of com-
pounding periods per year, the higher the interest earned on the investment. Today interest 
can actually be calculated on a continuous basis—that is, up to the minute. In competitive 
markets, many banks offer continuous compounding as an incentive to attract new deposits.
To find the number of compounding periods of an investment, multiply the number of 
years by the number of periods per year.
Compounding periods = Years × Periods per year
To find the interest rate per period, divide the annual, or nominal, rate by the number of 
periods per year.
Interest rate per period =
Nominal rate
Period per year
STEPS FOR USING COMPOUND INTEREST TABLES
STEP 1. Scan across the top row to find the interest rate per period.
STEP 2. Look down that column to the row corresponding to the number of periods.
STEP 3. The table factor at the intersection of the rate-per-period column and the 
 number-of-periods row is the future value of $1 at compound interest. Multiply 
the table factor by the principal to determine the compound amount.
Compound amount = Table factor × Principal

CREATING COMPOUND INTEREST TABLE FACTORS 
FOR PERIODS BEYOND THE TABLE
When the number of periods of an investment is greater than the number of periods provided 
by the compound interest table, you can compute a new table factor by multiplying the factors 
for any two periods that add up to the number of periods required. For answer consistency 
in this chapter, use the two table factors that represent half, or values as close as possible to 
half, of the periods required. For example,

Calculate a new table factor and find the compound amount of $10,000 invested at 12% 
compounded monthly for 3 years.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
This investment requires a table factor for 36 periods (12 periods per year for 3 years). Because 
Table 11-1 provides factors only up to 25 periods, we must create one using the steps above.
Step 1. At 12% interest compounded monthly, the rate per period is 1%. Because we are 
 looking for 36 periods, we will use the factors for 18 and 18 periods at 1%.
Table factor for 18 periods,  1% = 1.19615
Table factor for 18 periods,  1% = 1.19615
Step 2. Multiply the factors for 18 and 18 periods.
1.19615 × 1.19615 = 1.4307748
Now find the table factor by scanning across the top row of the compound interest table to 
2% and down the 2% column to 20 periods. The table factor at that intersection is1.48595. The 
compound amount is found by multiplying the table factor by the principal:
Compound amount = Table factor × Principal
Compound amount = 1.48595 × 1,200 = $1,783.14
The amount of interest is found by subtracting the principal from the compound amount.
Compound interest = Compound amount −Principal 
Compound interest = 1,783.14 −1,200.00 = $583.14

CALCULATING ANNUAL PERCENTAGE YIELD 
(APY) OR EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE
In describing investments and loans, the advertised or stated interest rate is known as the 
annual, or nominal, rate. It is also the rate used to calculate the compound interest. Consider, 
however, what happens to an investment of $100 at 12% nominal interest.
As we learned in Performance Objective 11-2, the greater the number of compounding 
periods per year, the higher the amount of interest earned. (See Exhibit 11-4.) Although the 
nominal interest rate is12%, with monthly compounding, the $100 earns more than12%. This 
is why many investment offers today advertise daily or continuous compounding. How much 
are these investments really earning?

The Rule of 72
There is an easy method for calculating 
approximately how long it takes an amount 
of money to double in value at compound 
interest. Simply divide the number 72 by the 
interest rate. The result is the number of years 
it takes to double in value.
Years to double =

Compound interest rate
t For example, if you invested money at 6% 
compound interest, it would take  
12 years (72

t If you were able to find an investment that 
paid 9% interest, you could double your 
money in 8 years (72
9 = 8).

CALCULATING COMPOUND AMOUNT (FUTURE VALUE) 
BY USING THE COMPOUND INTEREST FORMULA
If your calculator has an exponential function key, yx, you can calculate the compound 
amount of an investment by using the compound interest formula.
The compound interest formula states:
A = P(1 + i)n
where:
A = Compound amount
P = Principal
i = Interest rate per period (expressed as a decimal)
n = Total compounding periods (years × periods per year)

What is the compound amount, compound interest, and annual percentage yield of 
$4,000 invested for 1 year at 8% compounded semiannually?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
First, we must find the total compound interest earned in 1 year. We can find the compound amount 
using the factor for 4%, two periods, from Table 11-1.
Compound amount = Table factor × Principal
Compound amount = 1.08160 × 4,000 = $4,326.40
Compound interest = Compound amount −Principal
Compound interest = 4,326.40 −4,000 = $326.40
Annual percentage yield = Total compound interest earned in 1 year
Principal
Annual percentage yield = 326.40
4,000.00 = 8.16%

Jill Quinn invested $7,000 in a certificate of deposit for 1 year at 6% interest compounded quar-
terly. What is the compound amount, compound interest, and annual percentage yield of Jill’s

The annual percentage yield (APY), or effective rate, reflects the real rate of return on an 
investment. APY is calculated by finding the total compound interest earned in 1 year and 
dividing by the principal. Note: This is actually the simple interest formula (from Chapter 10) 
solved for rate R = I ÷ PT, where T is equal to 1.
Annual percentage (APY) = Total compound interest earned in 1 year
Principal
From Exhibit 11-4, we can see that the annual percentage yield is the same as the  nominal 
rate when interest is compounded annually; however, it jumps to 12.36% ($12.36) when 
the compounding is changed to semiannually and to 12.68 % ($12.68) when compounded 
monthly.
annual percentage yield (APY),  
or effective rate The real or true rate 
of return on an investment. It is the total 
 compound interest earned in 1 year divided 
by the principal. The more compounding 
 periods per year, the higher the APY.
Regulation DD of the Truth in Savings Law, 
enacted by Congress in 1993, requires 
banks and other depository institutions to 
fully disclose the terms of deposit accounts 
to consumers. The major provisions of the 
regulation require institutions to:
t Provide consumer account holders with 
written information about important 
terms of an account, including the 
annual percentage yield.
t Provide fee and other information on any 
periodic statement sent to consumers.
t Use prescribed methods to determine 
the balance on which interest is 
calculated.
t Comply with special requirements when 
advertising deposit accounts.

BUSINESS DECISION: DAILY COMPOUNDING
41. As an incentive to attract savings deposits, most financial institutions today offer daily and even 
continuous compounding. This means that savings, or passbook, accounts, as well as CDs, 
earn interest compounded each day or even more frequently, such as every hour or even every 
minute. (Continuous compounding, in which compounding occurs every instant, involves a 
 different  formula that is derived from the formula we’ve been using.) Let’s take a look at daily 
compounding.
To calculate the compound amount, A, of an investment with daily compounding, use the 
compound interest formula modified as follows:
r
Rate per period (daily) =
i
365 (nominal interest rate, i, divided by 365)
r
Number of periods (days), n, = number of days of the investment.

PRESENT VALUE
In Section I, we learned how to find a future value when the present value was known. Let’s 
take a look at the reverse situation, also commonly found in business. When a future value 
(an amount needed in the future) is known, the present value is the amount that must be 
invested today to accumulate with compound interest to that future value. For example, if a 
corporation wants $100,000 in 5 years (future value—known) to replace its fleet of trucks, 
what amount must be invested today (present value—unknown) at 8% compounded quarterly 
to achieve this goal? (See Exhibit 11-5.)
SECTION II 11
CALCULATING THE PRESENT VALUE OF A FUTURE 
AMOUNT BY USING PRESENT VALUE TABLES
Just as there are compound interest tables to aid in the calculation of compound amounts, 
present value tables help calculate the present value of a known future amount. Table 11-2 
is such a table. Note that this table is similar to the compound interest table in that the table 
factors are based on the interest rate per period and the number of compounding periods.

STEPS FOR USING PRESENT VALUE TABLES
45&1 Scan across the top row to find the interest rate per period.
45&1 Look down that column to the row corresponding to the number of periods.
45&1 The table factor found at the intersection of the rate-per-period column and 
the number-of-periods row is the present value of $1 at compound interest. 
Multiply the table factor by the compound amount to determine the present 
value.
Present value = Table factor × Compound amount (future value)

Charlie Watson will need $5,000 in 8 years. Use Table 11-2 to find how much he must 
invest now at 6% interest compounded semiannually to have $5,000, 8 years from now.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To solve this present value problem, we will use 3% per period (6% nominal rate ÷ 2 periods per 
year) and 16 periods (8 years × 2 periods per year).
Step 1. Scan the top row of the present value table to 3%.
Step 2. Look down that column to the row corresponding to 16 periods.

CREATING PRESENT VALUE TABLE FACTORS 
FOR PERIODS BEYOND THE TABLE
Just as with the compound interest tables, there may be times when the number of periods of 
an investment or a loan is greater than the number of periods provided by the present value 
tables. When this occurs, you can create a new table factor by multiplying the table factors 
for any two periods that add up to the number of periods required.
For answer consistency in this chapter, use the two table factors that represent half, or 
values as close as possible to half, of the periods required. For example,
20 periods
20 periods
40 periods        
41 periods
20 periods
21 periods
11-7 
Step 3. Find the table factor at the intersection of Steps 1 and 2 and multiply it by the 
 compound amount to find the present value. Table factor = .62317.
Present value = Table factor × Compound amount 
Present value = .62317 × 5,000 = $3,115.85

Calculate a new table factor and find the present value of $2,000 if the interest rate is 
12% compounded quarterly for 8 years.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
This investment requires a table factor for 32 periods, four periods per year for 8 years. Because 
Table 11-2 provides factors only up to 25 periods, we must create one by using the steps above.
Step 1. At 12% interest compounded quarterly, the rate per period is 3%. Because we are 
looking for 32 periods, we will use the factors for 16 and 16 periods at 3%.
Table factor for 16 periods,  3% = .62317
Table factor for 16 periods,  3% = .62317
Step 2. Multiply the factors for 16 and 16 periods:
.62317 × .62317 = .3883408
Which table to use—Compound Interest 
(Table 11-1) or Present Value (Table 11-2)?
Note that the Compound Interest Table 
factors are all greater than 1, whereas the 
Present Value Table factors are all less  
than 1.

 When solving for compound amount, a 
future amount greater than the present 
value, use the table with factors greater 
than 1—Compound Interest Table.

 When solving for present value, a  present 
amount less than the future value, use the 
table with factors less than 1—Present

CALCULATING PRESENT VALUE OF A FUTURE AMOUNT 
BY USING THE PRESENT VALUE FORMULA
If your calculator has an exponential function key, yx, you can calculate the present value of 
an investment by using the present value formula.
The present value formula states:
PV =
A
(1 + i)n
where:
PV = Present value
A = Compound amount
i = Interest rate per period (expressed as a decimal)
n = Total compounding periods (years × periods per year)
11-8
Step 3. Rounding to five decimal places, the new table factor for 32 periods is .38834. The 
present value of the $2,000 investment is
Present value = Table factor × Compound amount
Present value = .38834 × 2,000 = $776.68

When you buy a bond, you are lending 
money to the corporation that issued 
it. The corporation promises to return 
your money (or principal) on a specified 
maturity date. Until that time, it also pays 
you a stated rate of interest.

Manually Calculating 
Compound Amount (Future 
Value)
Performance Objective 11-1, 
Page 343
In compound interest, the interest is applied a number 
of times during the term of an investment. Compound 
interest yields considerably higher interest than simple 
interest does because the investor is earning interest on 
the interest.
Interest can be compounded annually, semiannually, 
quarterly, monthly, daily, and continuously.
1. Determine the number of compounding periods 
(years × periods per year).
2. Apply the simple interest formula, I = PRT, as 
many times as there are compounding periods, 
adding interest to principal before each succeeding 
calculation.
Manually calculate the compound amount of a 
$1,000 investment at 8% interest compounded 
annually for 2 years.

Amount of compound interest is calculated by 
subtracting the original principal from the compound 
amount.
Compound interest
= Compound amount −Principal
What is the amount of compound interest earned 
in the problem above?

Performance Objective 11-2, 
Page 344
1. Scan across the top row of Table 11-1 to find the 
interest rate per period.
2. Look down that column to the row corresponding 
to the number of compounding periods.
3. The table factor found at the intersection of the 
rate-per-period column and the periods row is the 
future value of $1.00 at compound interest.
Compound amount = Table factor × Principal
Use Table 11-1 to find the compound amount 
of an investment of $2,000 at 12% interest 
compounded quarterly for 6 years.
Rate = 3% per period (12% ÷ 4)
Periods = 24 (6 years × 4)
Table factor = 2.03279
Compound amount = 2.03279 × 2,000

1.12683 × 5,000 = 5,634.15
Interest = Cmp. amt. −Principal
Interest = 5,634.15 −5,000.00 = 634.15

BUSINESS DECISION: PAY ME NOW,  
PAY ME LATER
40. You are the owner of an apartment building that is being offered for sale for $1,500,000. You 
receive an offer from a prospective buyer who wants to pay you $500,000 now, $500,000 in 
6 months, and $500,000 in 1 year.
a. What is the actual present value of this offer considering you can earn 12% interest 
compounded monthly on your money?
b. If another buyer offers to pay you $1,425,000 cash now, which is a better deal?
c. Because you understand the “time value of money” concept, you have negotiated a deal 
with the original buyer from part a whereby you will accept the three-payment offer but will 
charge 12% interest compounded monthly on the two delayed payments. Calculate the total 
purchase price under this new arrangement.
d. Now calculate the present value of the new deal to verify that you will receive the original 
asking price of $1,500,000 for your apartment building.
COLLABORATIVE LEARNING ACTIVITY
Putting Your Money To Work
As a team, research financial institutions in your area (brick-and-mortar banks), as well as Internet-only 
institutions (virtual banks and e-banks), to find and list various certificates of deposit currently being 
offered. Assume that you want to invest $10,000 for 12 months.
a. What interest rates do these CDs pay? How often is interest compounded?
b. What is the early withdrawal penalty?
c. Are these CDs insured? If so, by whom? What is the limit per account?
d. Overall, which institution offers the CD that would earn the most interest after 12 months?
Pay Me Now, Pay Me Later is a good example 
of how the “time value of money” concept 
can be applied in business.
Remember: When interest can be earned, 
money today is more desirable than the same 
amount of money in the future.

FUTURE VALUE OF AN ANNUITY: ORDINARY AND ANNUITY DUE
The concepts relating to compound interest in Chapter 11 were mainly concerned with lump 
sum investments or payments. Frequently in business, situations involve a series of equal 
periodic payments or receipts rather than lump sums. These are known as annuities. An 
annuity is the payment or receipt of equal cash amounts per period for a specified amount of 
time. Some common applications are insurance and retirement plan premiums and payouts; 
loan payments; and savings plans for future events such as starting a business, going to col-
lege, or purchasing expensive items (e.g., real estate or business equipment).
In this chapter, you learn to calculate the future value of an annuity, the amount accu-
mulated at compound interest from a series of equal periodic payments. You also learn to 
calculate the present value of an annuity, the amount that must be deposited now at compound 
interest to yield a series of equal periodic payments. Exhibit 12-1 graphically shows the dif-
ference between the future value of an annuity and the present value of an annuity.
All the exercises in this chapter are of the type known as simple annuities. This means 
that the number of compounding periods per year coincides with the number of annuity pay-
ments per year. For example, if the annuity payments are monthly, the interest is compounded 
monthly; if the annuity payments are made every six months, the interest is compounded 
semiannually. Complex annuities are those in which the annuity payments and compounding 
periods do not coincide.
As with compound interest, annuities can be calculated manually, by tables, and by for-
mulas. Manual computation is useful for illustrative purposes; however, it is too tedious 
because it requires a calculation for each period. The table method is the easiest and most 
widely used and is the basis for this chapter’s exercises. As in Chapter 11, there are formulas 
to calculate annuities; however, they require calculators with the exponential function key, yx, 
and the change-of-sign key, + / −. These optional Performance Objectives are for students 
with business, financial, or scientific calculators.
CALCULATING THE FUTURE VALUE OF AN 
ORDINARY ANNUITY BY USING TABLES
Annuities are categorized into annuities certain and contingent annuities. Annuities certain
are annuities that have a specified number of periods, such as $200 per month for 5 years or 
$500 semiannually for 10 years. Contingent annuities are based on an uncertain time period, 
such as a retirement plan that is payable only for the lifetime of the retiree. This chapter is 
concerned only with annuities certain.
annuity Payment or receipt of equal 
amounts of money per period for a specified 
amount of time.
simple annuities Annuities in which the 
number of compounding periods per year 
coincides with the number of annuity payments 
per year.
complex annuities Annuities in which the 
annuity payments and compounding periods 
do not coincide.
annuities certain Annuities that have a 
specified number of time periods.
contingent annuities Annuities based on 
an uncertain time period, such as the life of a 
person.

When the annuity payment is made at the end of each period, it is known as an ordinary 
annuity. When the payment is made at the beginning of each period, it is called an annuity 
due. A salary paid at the end of each month is an example of an ordinary annuity. A mortgage 
payment or rent paid at the beginning of each month is an example of an annuity due.
The future value of an annuity is also known as the amount of an annuity. It is the total 
of the annuity payments plus the accumulated compound interest on those payments.
For illustrative purposes, consider the following annuity calculated manually.
What is the future value of an ordinary annuity of $10,000 per year for 4 years at 
6% interest compounded annually?
Because this is an ordinary annuity, the payment is made at the end of each period (in this 
case, years). Each interest calculation uses I = PRT, with R = .06 and T = 1 year.
As you can see, calculating annuities this way is tedious. An annuity of 10 years with 
payments made monthly would require 120 calculations. As with compound interest, we will 
use tables to calculate the future value (amount) of an annuity.
ordinary annuity Annuity that is paid or 
received at the end of each time period.
annuity due Annuity that is paid or received 
at the beginning of each time period.
future value of an annuity, or amount 
of an annuity The total amount of the 
 annuity payments and the accumulated

STEPS 
FOR CALCULATING FUTURE VALUE (AMOUNT)  
OF AN ORDINARY ANNUITY
STEP 1. Calculate the interest rate per period for the annuity (nominal rate ÷ periods 
per year).
STEP 2. Determine the number of periods of the annuity (years × periods per year).
STEP 3. From Table 12-1 on pages 372–373, locate the ordinary annuity table factor at 
the intersection of the rate-per-period column and the number-of-periods row.
STEP 4. Calculate the future value of the ordinary annuity.
Future value
(ordinary annuity) = Ordinary annuity
table factor
× Annuity
payment
The procedure for using the annuity tables, 
Tables 12-1 and 12-2, is the same as we used 
with the compound interest and present 
value tables in Chapter 11.
Table factors are found at the intersection 
of the rate-per-period column and the 
number-of-periods row.

CALCULATING THE FUTURE VALUE  
OF AN ANNUITY DUE BY USING TABLES
Once again, for illustrative purposes, let’s manually calculate the future value of the annuity. 
This time, however, it is an annuity due.
What is the amount of an annuity due of $10,000 per year for 4 years at 6% interest 
compounded annually?
Because this is an annuity due, the payment is made at the beginning of each period. Each 
interest calculation uses I = PRT, with R = .06 and T = 1 year.

Stuart Daniels deposited $3,000 at the end of each year for 8 years in his savings account. 
If his bank paid 5% interest compounded annually, use Table 12-1 to find the future value 
of Stuart’s account.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. The rate period is 5% (5% ÷ 1 period per year).
Step 2. The number of periods is eight (8 years × 1 period per year).
Step 3. From Table 12-1, the table factor for 5%, eight periods is 9.54911.
Step 4. Future value = Ordinary annuity table factor × Annuity payment
Future value = 9.54911 × 3,000 = $28,647.33

Traditionally, financial advisors have 
recommended setting aside 10% of your 
annual income for retirement. However, 
a more modern planning strategy begins 
by taking a figure that’s 70% −90% of 
annual earnings and using that as a goal to 
determine how much one should set aside to 
yield that amount yearly in combination with 
pensions and social security.

When the future value of an annuity due is calculated, the table factor is found by using the 
same table as ordinary annuities (Table 12-1), with some modifications in the steps. With annuities 
due, you must add one period to the number of periods and subtract 1.00000 from the table factor.
If parents save and invest $10 per workday 
at 12% interest from the birth date of their 
child, when the child is 18 and ready for 
college, the parents would have $150,000 
accumulated—through the power 
of compounding.

STEPS    
FOR CALCULATING FUTURE VALUE (AMOUNT)  
OF AN ANNUITY DUE
STEP 1. Calculate the number of periods of the annuity (years × periods per year) and 
add one period to the total.
STEP 2. Calculate the interest rate per period (nominal rate ÷ periods per year).
STEP 3. From Table 12-1, locate the table factor at the intersection of the rate-per-
period column and the number-of-periods row.
STEP 4. Subtract 1.00000 from the ordinary annuity table factor to get the annuity due 
table factor.
STEP 5. Calculate the future value of the annuity due.
Future value (annuity due) = Annuity due table factor × Annuity payment 
CALCULATING THE FUTURE VALUE OF AN ORDINARY 
ANNUITY AND AN ANNUITY DUE BY FORMULA
Students with financial, business, or scientific calculators may use the following formulas 
to solve for the future value of an ordinary annuity and the future value of an annuity due.

Chris Manning deposited $60 at the beginning of each month for 2 years at his credit 
union. If the interest rate was 12% compounded monthly, use Table 12-1 to calculate the 
future value of Chris’s account.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. Number of periods of the annuity due is 24 (2 × 12) + 1 for a total of 25.
Step 2. Interest rate per period is 1% (12% ÷ 12).
Step 3. The ordinary annuity table factor at the intersection of the rate column and the periods 
row is 28.24320.
Step 4. Subtract 1.00000 from the table factor:
  28.24320  ordinary annuity table factor
−1.00000
  27.24320  annuity due table factor
Step 5. 
Future value = Annuity due table factor × Annuity payment
Future value = 27.24320 × 60 = $1,634.59

PRESENT VALUE OF AN ANNUITY:

In Section I of this chapter, we learned to calculate the future value of an annuity. This busi-

savings account. The annuity starts with nothing and accumulates at compound interest to 
a future amount. Now consider the opposite situation. What if we wanted an account from

which we could withdraw a series of equal payments over a period of time? This business 
situation requires that a lump sum amount be deposited at compound interest now to yield the 
specified annuity payments. The lump sum that is required up front is known as the present 
value of an annuity.
Let’s look at a business situation using this type of annuity. A company owes $10,000 
interest to bondholders at the end of each month for the next 3 years. The company decides 
to set up an account with a lump sum deposit now, which at compound interest will yield the 
$10,000 monthly payments for 3 years. After 3 years, the debt will have been paid and the 
account will be zero.
Just as in Section I, these annuities can be ordinary, whereby withdrawals from the 
account are made at the end of each period, or annuity due, in which the withdrawals are 
made at the beginning. As with the future value of an annuity, we will use tables to calcu-
late the present value of an annuity. Once again, in addition to tables, these annuities can be 
solved by using formulas requiring a calculator with a y x key.

Step 1. The rate per period is 9% (9% ÷ 1 period per year).
Step 2. The number of periods is 10 (10 years × 1 period per year).
Step 3. From Table 12-2, the table factor for 9%, 10 periods is 6.41766.

How much must be deposited now at 10% compounded semiannually to yield an annuity 
payment of $2,000 at the beginning of each 6-month period for 7 years?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. The number of periods for the annuity due is 14 (7 years × 2 periods per year)
less 1 period = 13.
Step 2. The rate per period is 5% (10% ÷ 2 periods per year).
Step 3. From Table 12-2, the ordinary annuity table factor for 5%, 13 periods is 9.39357.
Step 4. Add 1 to the table factor from Step 3 to get 10.39357, the annuity due table factor.
Step 5. 
Present value (annuity due) =  Annuity due table factor × Annuity payment
Present value = 10.39357 × 2,000 = $20,787.14
TRYITEXERCISE 5
You are the accountant at Supreme Lumber, Inc. Based on sales and expense forecasts, you have 
estimated that $10,000 must be sent to the Internal Revenue Service for income tax payments at 
the beginning of each 3-month period for the next 3 years. How much must be deposited now at 
6% compounded quarterly to yield the annuity payment needed?

STEPS
   FOR CALCULATING PRESENT VALUE  
OF AN ANNUITY DUE
45&1 Calculate the number of periods of the annuity (years × periods per year) and 
subtract one period from the total.
45&1 Calculate the interest rate per period (nominal rate ÷ periods per year).
45&1 From Table 12-2, locate the table factor at the intersection of the rate-per-
period column and the number-of-periods row.
45&1 Add 1.00000 to the ordinary annuity table factor to get the annuity due table 
factor.
45&1 Calculate the present value of the annuity due.
Present value
(annuity due)  =  Annuity due
table factor   ×  Annuity
payment
The procedure for finding the present value 
table factor for an annuity due is the opposite
of that for future value factors. This time you 
must subtract a period and add a 1.00000.

CALCULATING THE PRESENT VALUE OF AN ORDINARY 
ANNUITY AND AN ANNUITY DUE BY FORMULA
Students with financial, business, or scientific calculators may use the following formulas to 
solve for the present value of an ordinary annuity and the present value of an annuity due. 
Note that the annuity due formula is the same as the ordinary annuity formula except that it is 
multiplied by (1 + i). This is to account for the fact that with an annuity due, each payment 
earns interest for one additional period because payments are made at the beginning of each 
period, not the end.
Present value of an ordinary annuity
PV = Pmt × 1 −(1 + i ) −n
i
Present value of an annuity due
PV = Pmt × 1 −(1 + i ) −n
i
× (1 + i)
where:
  PV = present value (lump sum)
Pmt = annuity payment
 
i = interest rate per period (nominal rate ÷ periods per year)
 n = number of periods (years × periods per year)

a. What is the present value of an ordinary annuity of $100 per month for 4 years at 6% interest 
compounded monthly?
b. What is the present value of this investment if it is an annuity due?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
a. For this present value of an ordinary annuity problem, we use i = .5% (6% ÷ 12) and n = 48 
periods (4 years × 12 periods per year).
PV = Pmt × 1 −(1 + i)−n
i
PV = 100 × 1 −(1 + .005) −48
.005
PV = 100 × 1 −(1.005) −48
.005
PV = 100 × 1 −.7870984111
.005
PV = 100 × .2129015889

PV = 100 × 42.58031778 = $4,258.03

ordinary annuity by (1 + i) for one extra compounding period.
PVannuity due = (1 + i) × PVordinary annuity
PVannuity due = (1 + .005) × 4,258.03

SINKING FUNDS AND AMORTIZATION
Sinking funds and amortization are two common applications of annuities. In the previous 
sections of this chapter, the amount of the annuity payment was known and you were asked 
to calculate the future or present value (lump sum) of the annuity. In this section, the future 
or present value of the annuity is known and the amount of the payments is calculated.
A sinking fund situation occurs when the future value of an annuity is known and the 
payment required each period to amount to that future value is the unknown. Sinking funds
are accounts used to set aside equal amounts of money at the end of each period at compound 
interest for the purpose of saving for a future obligation. Businesses use sinking funds to 
accumulate money for such things as new equipment, facility expansion, and other expensive 
items needed in the future. Another common use is to retire financial obligations such as bond 
issues that come due at a future date. Individuals can use sinking funds to save for a college 
education, a car, the down payment on a house, or a vacation.
Amortization is the opposite of a sinking fund. Amortization is a financial arrangement 
whereby a lump-sum obligation is incurred at compound interest now (present value) and is 
paid off or liquidated by a series of equal periodic payments for a specified amount of time. 
With amortization, the amount of the loan or obligation is given and the equal payments that 
will amortize, or pay off, the obligation must be calculated. Some business uses of amortiza-
tion include paying off loans and liquidating insurance or retirement funds.
In this section, you learn to calculate the sinking fund payment required to save for a 
future amount and the amortization payment required to liquidate a present amount. We 
assume that all annuities are ordinary, with payments made at the end of each period. As in 
previous sections, these exercises can be calculated by tables or by formulas.
CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF A SINKING  
FUND PAYMENT BY TABLE
In a sinking fund, the future value is known; therefore, we use the future value of an annuity 
table (Table 12-1) to calculate the amount of the payment.
sinking funds Accounts used to set aside 
equal amounts of money at the end of each 
period at compound interest for the purpose 
of saving for a future obligation.
amortization A financial arrangement 
whereby a lump-sum obligation is incurred at 
compound interest now, such as a loan, and 
is paid off or liquidated by a series of equal 
 periodic payments for a specified amount 
of time.

CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF AN  
AMORTIZATION PAYMENT BY TABLE
Amortization is the process of “paying off” a financial obligation with a series of equal and 
regular payments over a period of time. With amortization, the original amount of the loan or 
obligation is known (present value); therefore, we use the present value table (Table 12-2) to 
calculate the amount of the payment.

(12% ÷ 12 periods per year). From Table 12-2, 24 periods, 1% per period gives a

Managing Your Money
/FX3VMFTUP-JWF#Z
Why is there so much month left at the end of the money? In recent 
years, our economy has undergone some dramatic changes. The “Great 
Recession” has significantly altered the financial planning  parameters 
for individuals and families seeking financial freedom.
Here are some new planning guidelines from the editors of Money 
magazine and Bank of America to help you attain your long-term 
financial goals.
t 4BWJOHT – Save at least 15% (and ideally 20%) of your income for 
long-term goals. The old rule was 10%, but that was when you could 
count on pension plans, shorter retirement periods, and better market 
returns.
t %FCU – Keep your debt-to-income ratio under 30%. That’s down 
from 36% so that you can direct more cash flow toward emergency 
and retirement savings. As a cushion, keep a six-month reserve of 
cash in a high-yield savings account and any additional emergency 
money in a short-term bond index fund.
t )PNF – Look at refinancing when rates are one percentage point 
lower than your current rate, not two as in years past when closing 
costs were higher. You should plan to live in the house for at least 
as long as it will take to pay off the closing costs and fees with the 
reduction in payment. (See the Mortgage Refinancing Worksheet on 
page 472 in Chapter 14.)
t 4QFOEJOH – Keep discretionary spending (clothes, dining out, 
movies) under 20% of your take-home pay. Before the recession, 
you could play with up to 30%, but average debt obligations 
have risen.
t *OWFTUNFOUT – Invest no more than 5% of your portfolio in your 
company stock or any single stock. The old yardstick was 10%, but 
you’ll be safer with more diversification.
t "MMPDBUJPO – To determine how much of your portfolio should be in 
stocks, subtract your age from 110. The old formula subtracted your 
age from 100, but rising medical costs and increasing life spans 
necessitate being more aggressive. If you are comfortable with even 
more risk, subtract your age from 120.
t 3FUJSFNFOU – To figure out how big a nest egg you’ll need, multiply 
your ideal annual income by 30. (First, subtract any pension and 
Social Security income you will receive.) That’s up from the  previous 
rule of 25 because of increased longevity.

OPEN-END CREDIT—CHARGE ACCOUNTS,  
CREDIT CARDS, AND LINES OF CREDIT
“Buy now, pay later” is a concept that has become an everyday part of the way individuals 
and businesses purchase goods and services. Merchants in all categories, as well as lend-
ing  institutions, encourage us to just say “charge it!” Consumers are offered a wide variety 
of charge accounts with many extra services and incentives attached. Many  businesses 
have  charge accounts in the company name. These accounts may be used to facilitate 
employee travel and entertainment expenses or to fill up the company delivery truck with 
gasoline  without having to deal with cash. Exhibit 13-1 shows a sample credit card and 
its parts.
Lending and borrowing money comprise a huge portion of the U.S. economic system. 
Over the years, as the practice became more prevalent, the federal government enacted vari-
ous legislation to protect the consumer from being misled about credit and finance charges. 
One of the most important and comprehensive pieces of legislation, known as Regulation Z, 
covers both installment credit and open-end credit.
Regulation Z of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, also known as the Truth in 
Lending Act, as well as the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act, require that lend-
ers fully disclose to the customer, in writing, the cost of the credit and detailed information 
about their terms. Features such as finance charge, annual percentage rate (APR), cash 
advances, and annual fees must be disclosed in writing at the time you apply. The finance 
charge is the dollar amount that is paid for the credit. The annual percentage rate (APR)
is the effective or true annual interest rate being charged. If a card company offers you a 
written “preapproved” credit solicitation, the offer must include these terms. Also, card 
issuers must inform customers if they make certain changes in rates or coverage for credit 
insurance.
open-end credit A loan arrangement in which 
there is no set number of payments. As the balance 
of the loan is reduced, the  borrower can renew 
the amount of the loan up to a  pre-approved 
credit limit. A form of revolving credit.
finance charge Dollar amount that is paid for 
credit. Total of installment payments for an item 
less the cost of that item.
annual percentage rate (APR) Effective 
or true annual interest rate being charged for 
credit. Must be revealed to borrowers under the 
Truth in Lending Act.

In 2010, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of amendments to Regulation Z, 
known as the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act (the Credit 
Card Act). These amendments were designed to further protect consumers who use credit 
cards from a number of costly and undisclosed bank practices. Exhibit 13-2 outlines the 
major provisions of these new credit card reforms. Exhibits 13-3 and 13-5 illustrate how 
these reforms now appear on your monthly credit card statement and bank credit card offer 
disclosures.
When loans are backed by a simple promise to repay, they are known as unsecured loans. 
Most open-end credit accounts are unsecured. Loans that are backed by tangible assets, such 
as car and boat loans and home mortgage loans, are known as secured loans. These loans 
are backed, or secured, by an asset that can be repossessed and sold by the lender if the bor-
rower fails to comply with the rules of the loan. Secured loans are covered in Section II of 
this chapter and in Chapter 14.
Revolving credit is the most popular type of open-end credit. Under this agreement, the 
consumer has a prearranged credit limit and two payment options. The first option is to use 
the account as a regular charge account, whereby the balance is paid off at the end of the 
month with no finance charge. The second option is to make a minimum payment or portion 
of the payment but less than the full balance. This option leaves a carryover balance, which 
accrues finance charges by using the simple interest formula
Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
The name revolving credit comes from the fact that there is no set number of payments 
as with installment credit. The account revolves month to month, year to year—technically 
never being paid off as long as minimum monthly payments are made. Exhibit 13-3 illustrates 
a typical revolving credit monthly statement.
unsecured loans Loans that are backed simply 
by the borrower’s “promise” to repay, without any 
tangible asset pledged as  collateral. These loans 
carry more risk for the lender and therefore have 
higher interest rates than secured loans.
secured loans Loans that are backed by a 
tangible asset, such as a car, boat, or home, 
which can be repossessed and sold if the 
 borrower fails to pay back the loan. These loans 
carry less risk for the lender and therefore have 
lower interest rates than do unsecured loans.
revolving credit Loans made on a 
 continuous basis and billed periodically. Borrower 
makes minimum monthly payments or more and 
pays interest on the  outstanding balance. This is a 
form of open-end credit extended by many retail 
stores and credit card companies.

CALCULATING THE FINANCE CHARGE AND NEW BALANCE BY USING 
THE UNPAID OR PREVIOUS MONTH’S BALANCE METHOD
Open-end credit transactions are divided into time periods known as billing cycles. These 
cycles are commonly between 28 and 31 days. At the end of a billing cycle, a statement is 
sent to the account holder much like the one in Exhibit 13-3.
13-1
billing cycles Time periods, usually 28 
to 31 days, used in billing revolving credit 
accounts. Account statements are sent to the 
borrower after each billing cycle.
Using Smartphones for Payment  In a survey 
conducted by the Pew Research Center, 65% 
of the experts surveyed predicted that by 2020 
using smartphones as a payment method will 
almost entirely replace the use of credit cards.

Jake Morrison has a revolving department store credit account with an annual  percentage 
rate of 18%. His balance from last month is $322.40. During the month, he purchased 
shirts for $65.60 and a baseball bat for $43.25. He returned a tie for a credit of $22.95 and 
made a $50 payment. If the department store uses the unpaid balance method, what is 
the finance charge on the account and what is Jake’s new balance?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1.
 
Periodic rate = Annual percentage rate
12
Periodic rate = 18%
12 = 1.5%
Step 2. Finance charge = Previous month’s balance × Periodic rate
Finance charge = 322.40 × .015
Finance charge = 4.836 = $4.84
Step 3. Total the purchases for the month:
$65.60 + $43.25 = $108.85
Step 4. Total the payments and credits for the month:
$50.00 + $22.95 = $72.95
Step 5. Find the new balance for Jake’s account by using the formula

STEPS
TO CALCULATE THE FINANCE CHARGE AND NEW 
BALANCE BY USING THE UNPAID BALANCE METHOD
STEP 1.
Divide the annual percentage rate by 12 to find the monthly or periodic interest 
rate. (Round to the nearest hundredth percent when necessary.)
Periodic rate = Annual percentage rate
12
STEP 2.
Calculate the finance charge by multiplying the previous month’s balance by 
the periodic interest rate from Step 1.
Finance charge = Previous month’s balance × Periodic rate
STEP 3.
Total all the purchases and cash advances for the month.
STEP 4.
Total all the payments and credits for the month.
STEP 5.
Use the following formula to determine the new balance:
New  
balance = Previous 
balance
+ Finance

CALCULATING THE FINANCE CHARGE AND NEW BALANCE 
BY USING THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE METHOD
In business today, the method most widely used to calculate the finance charge on a  revolving 
credit account is known as the average daily balance. This method precisely tracks the 
 activity in an account on a daily basis. Each day’s balance of a billing cycle is totaled and 
then divided by the number of days in that cycle. This gives an average of all the daily 
balances.
For accounts in which many charges are made each month, the average daily balance 
method results in much higher interest than the unpaid balance method because interest starts 
accruing on the day purchases are made or cash advances are taken.
13-2
average daily balance In revolving  
credit, the most commonly used method for 
determining the finance charge for a billing 
cycle. It is the total of the daily balances  
divided by the number of days in the cycle.

CALCULATING THE FINANCE CHARGE AND NEW BALANCE 
OF BUSINESS AND PERSONAL LINES OF CREDIT
One of the most useful types of open-end credit is the business or personal line of credit. In 
this section, we investigate the unsecured credit line, which is based on your own merit. In 
Chapter 14, we discuss the home equity line of credit, which is secured by a home or another 
piece of real estate property.
A line of credit is an important tool for ongoing businesses and responsible individuals. 
For those who qualify, unsecured lines of credit generally range from $2,500 to $250,000. 
The amount is based on your ability to pay as well as your financial and credit history. This 
pre-approved borrowing power essentially gives you the ability to become your own private 
banker. Once the line has been established, you can borrow money by simply writing a check. 
Lines of credit usually have an annual usage fee of between $50 and $100, and most lenders 
require that you update your financial information each year.
With credit lines, you pay interest only on the outstanding average daily balance of your 
loan. For most lines and some credit cards, the interest rate is variable and is based on, or 
indexed to, the prime rate. The U.S. prime rate is the lending rate at which the largest and most 
creditworthy corporations in the country borrow money from banks. The current prime rate 
is published daily in the Wall Street Journal in a chart entitled “Consumer Rates and Returns 
to Investors.” Exhibit 13-4 shows an example of this chart.
A typical line of credit quotes interest as the prime rate plus a fixed percent, such as 
“prime + 3%” or “prime + 6.8%.” Some lenders have a minimum rate regardless of the prime 
rate, such as “prime + 3%, minimum 10%.” In this case, when the prime is greater than 7%, 
the rate varies up and down. When the prime falls to less than 7%, the minimum 10% rate 
applies. This guarantees the lender at least a 10% return on funds loaned. Exhibit 13-5 is an 
example of a credit card rate disclosure indexed to the prime rate.
Like the calculation of finance charges and new balances on credit cards (see the steps 
on page 412), the finance charge on a line of credit is based on average daily balance and is 
calculated by 
Finance charge = Average daily balance × Periodic rate
This means that interest begins as soon as you write a check for a loan. Typically, the loan 
is paid back on a flexible schedule. In most cases, balances of $100 or less must be paid in 
full. Larger balances require minimum monthly payments of $100 or 2% of the outstanding 
balance, whichever is greater. As you repay, the line of credit renews itself. The new balance 
of the line of credit is calculated by
New balance = Previous balance + Finance charge + Loans −Payments
13-3
line of credit Pre-approved amount of 
 open-end credit based on borrower’s ability  
to pay.
U.S. prime rate Lending rate at which the 
largest and most creditworthy corporations 
borrow money from banks. The interest rate of 
most lines of credit is tied to the movement of 
the prime rate.

Shari’s Chocolate Shop has a $20,000 line of credit with the Shangri-La National Bank. The 
annual percentage rate charged on the account is the current prime rate plus 4%. There 
is a minimum APR on the account of 10%. The starting balance on April 1 was $2,350. On 
April 9, Shari borrowed $1,500 to pay for a shipment of assorted gift items. On April 20, 
she made a $3,000 payment on the account. On April 26, she borrowed another $2,500 to 
pay for air conditioning repairs. The billing cycle for April has 30 days. If the current prime 
rate is 8%, what is the finance charge on the account and what is Shari’s new balance?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
To solve this problem, we must find the annual percentage rate, the periodic rate, the average daily 
balance, the finance charge, and the new balance.
Annual percentage rate: The annual percentage rate is prime plus 4%, with a minimum of 10%. 
Because the current prime is 8%, the APR on this line of credit is 12% (8% + 4%).
Periodic rate:
Periodic rate = Annual percentage rate
12 months
= 12%
12  =  1%
Average daily balance: From the information given, we construct the following chart showing 
the account activity.

CALCULATING THE TOTAL DEFERRED PAYMENT PRICE AND THE
AMOUNT OF THE FINANCE CHARGE OF AN INSTALLMENT LOAN
Let’s take a look at some of the terminology of installment loans. When a consumer buys 
goods or services without any financing, the price paid is known as the cash price or purchase 
price. When financing is involved, the amount financed is found by subtracting the down 
payment from the cash or purchase price. Sometimes the down payment will be listed as a 
dollar amount, and other times it will be expressed as a percent of the purchase price.
Amount financed = Purchase price −Down payment

and services without the use of financing.
amount financed After the down payment, 
the amount of money that is borrowed to 
 complete a sale.
CLOSED-END CREDIT—INSTALLMENT LOANS
Closed-end credit in the form of installment loans is used extensively today for the purchase 
of durable goods such as cars, boats, electronic equipment, furniture, and appliances, as well 
as services such as vacations and home improvements. An installment loan is a lump-sum 
loan whereby the borrower repays the principal plus interest in a specified number of equal 
monthly payments. These loans generally range from 6 months to 10 years depending on 
what is being financed.
When a home or another real estate property is financed, the installment loan is known 
as a mortgage. A mortgage may be for as long as 30 years on a home and even longer on 
commercial property such as an office building or a factory. These loans, along with home 
equity loans, are discussed in Chapter 14.
Many installment loans are secured by the asset for which the loan was made. For exam-
ple, when a bank makes a car loan for three years, the consumer gets the car to use and 
monthly payments to make, but the lender still owns the car. Only after the final payment is 
made on the loan does the lender turn over the title (the proof of ownership document) to the 
borrower. An additional form of security for the lending institution is that borrowers are often 
asked to make a down payment as part of the loan agreement.
A down payment is a percentage of the purchase price that the buyer must pay in a lump 
sum at the time of purchase. Down payments on installment loans vary by category of mer-
chandise and generally range from between 0% to 30% of the price of the item. Sometimes 
the amount of the down payment is based on the credit rating of the borrower. Usually, the 
better the credit, the lower the down payment.

When the down payment is listed as a percent of the purchase price, it can be found by using
Down payment = Purchase price × Down  payment percent
A finance charge, which includes simple interest and any loan origination fees, is then 
added to the amount financed to give the total amount of installment payments.
Total amount of installment payments = Amount financed + Finance charge
The finance charge can be found by subtracting the amount financed from the total 
amount of installment payments.
Finance charge = Total amount of installment payments −Amount financed
When the amount of the monthly payments is known, the total amount of installment pay-
ments can be found by multiplying the monthly payment amount by the number of payments.

The total deferred payment price is the total amount of installment payments plus the

Tracy Hall is interested in buying a computer. At Radio Shack, she picks out a computer 
and a printer for a total cash price of $2,550. The salesperson informs her that if she quali-
fies for an installment loan, she may pay 20% now as a down payment and finance the 
balance with payments of $110 per month for 24 months.
a. What is the finance charge on this loan?
b. What is the total deferred payment price of Tracy’s computer?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
a. Finance charge:
To calculate the finance charge on this loan, we must first find the amount of the down payment, 
the amount financed, and the total amount of the installment payments.
Down payment = Purchase price × Down payment percent
Down payment = 2,550 × 20% = 2,550 × .2 = $510
Amount financed = Purchase price − Down payment
Amount financed = 2,550 − 510 = $2,040

Total amount of installment payments = 110 × 24 = $2,640

CALCULATING THE REGULAR MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF AN 
INSTALLMENT LOAN BY THE ADD-ON INTEREST METHOD
One of the most common methods of calculating the finance charge on an installment loan is 
known as add-on interest. Add-on interest is essentially the simple interest that we studied 
in Chapter 10. The term gets its name from the fact that the simple interest is computed and 
then added to the amount financed to get the total of installment payments. The interest or 
finance charge is computed by using the simple interest formula
Interest

Principal

× Rate × Time

add-on interest Popular method of 
 calculating the interest on an installment loan. 
Found by adding the simple interest (I = PRT) to 
the amount financed.
b. Total deferred payment price:
Total deferred payment price = Total of installment payments + Down payment
Total deferred payment price = 2,640 + 510
Total deferred payment price = $3,150

STEPS  TO CALCULATE THE REGULAR MONTHLY PAYMENT  
OF AN INSTALLMENT LOAN USING ADD-ON INTEREST
45&1 Calculate the amount to be financed by subtracting the down payment from 
the purchase price. Note: When the down payment is expressed as a percent, 
the amount financed can be found by the complement method because the 
percent financed is 100% minus the down payment percent.
Amount financed = Purchase price(100% −Down  payment percent)
45&1 Compute the add-on interest finance charge by using I = PRT, with the amount 
financed as the principal.
45&1 Find the total of installment payments by adding the finance charge to the 
amount financed.
Total of installment payments = Amount financed + Finance charge
45&1 Find the regular monthly payments by dividing the total of installment pay-
ments by the number of months of the loan.
Regular monthly payments = Total of installment payments

CALCULATING THE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OF AN 
INSTALLMENT LOAN BY APR TABLES AND BY FORMULA
As we learned in Objective 13-5, the add-on interest calculation for an installment loan is the 
same as the procedure we used on the simple interest promissory note. Although the interest 
is calculated the same way, the manner in which the loans are repaid is different. With prom-
issory notes, the principal plus interest is repaid at the end of the loan period. The borrower 
has the use of the principal for the full time period of the loan. With an installment loan, the 
principal plus interest is repaid in equal regular payments. Each month in which a payment is 
made, the borrower has less and less use of the principal.
For this reason, the effective or true interest rate on an installment loan is considerably 
higher than the simple add-on rate. As we learned in Section I of this chapter, the effective or 
true annual interest rate being charged on open- and closed-end credit is known as the APR.
The Federal Reserve Board has published APR tables that can be used to find the APR 
of an installment loan. APR tables, such as Table 13-1, have values representing the finance 
charge per $100 of the amount financed. To look up the APR of a loan, we must first calculate 
the finance charge per $100.

David Kendall bought a new boat with a 7% add-on interest installment loan from his

down payment and equal monthly payments for 5 years (60 months). What are David’s 
monthly payments?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. Amount financed = Purchase price(100% − Down payment percent)

Amount financed = $15,600
Step 2.

CALCULATING THE FINANCE CHARGE REBATE AND THE PAYOFF FOR 
LOANS PAID OFF EARLY BY USING THE SUM-OF-THE-DIGITS METHOD
Frequently, borrowers choose to repay installment loans before the full time period of the 
loan has elapsed. When loans are paid off early, the borrower is entitled to a finance charge 
rebate because the principal was not kept for the full amount of time on which the finance 
charge was calculated. At payoff, the lender must return, or rebate, to the borrower any 
unearned portion of the finance charge.
A widely accepted method for calculating the finance charge rebate is known as the sum-
of-the-digits method or the Rule of 78. This method is based on the assumption that the lender 
earns more interest in the early months of a loan, when the borrower has the use of much of 
the principal, than in the later months, when most of the principal has already been paid back.
When using this method, the finance charge is assumed to be divided in parts equal to the 
sum of the digits of the months of the loan. Because the sum of the digits of a 12-month loan 
is 78, the technique has become known as the Rule of 78.
Sum of the digits of 12 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78
The amount of finance charge in any given month is represented by a fraction whose 
numerator is the number of payments remaining, and the denominator is the sum of the digits 
of the number of months in the loan.
For a 12-month loan, for example, the fraction of the finance charge in the first month 
would be 12
78. The numerator is 12 because in the first month, no payments have been made; 
therefore, 12 payments remain. The denominator is 78 because the sum of the digits of

Business and personal financial decisions 
involve a concept known as opportunity cost. 
Like time, money used in one way  cannot 
be used in other ways. Financial choices are 
always a series of trade-offs.
If you buy a car with your savings, you give 
up the interest that money could earn. If you 
invest the money, you don’t get the car. If you 
borrow money to buy the car, you have to 
pay interest for its use.
When making financial choices such as 
saving, spending, investing, or borrowing, you 
should consider the interest-earning ability of 
that money as an opportunity cost.

12 payments is 78. In the second month, the lender earns 11

78. This 
decline continues until the last month when only 1
78 remains. Exhibit 13-6 illustrates the dis-
tribution of a $1,000 finance charge by using the sum-of-the-digits method.
With the sum-of-the-digits method, a rebate fraction is established based on when a 
loan is paid off. The numerator of the rebate fraction is the sum of the digits of the number 
of remaining payments, and the denominator is the sum of the digits of the total number of 
payments.
Rebate fraction = Sum of the digits of the number of remaining payments
Sum of the digits of the total number of payments
Although the sum of the digits is easily calculated by addition, it can become tedious for 
loans of 24, 36, or 48 months. For this reason, we will use the sum-of-the-digits formula to 
find the numerator and denominator of the rebate fraction. In the formula, n represents the 
number of payments.
Sum of digits = n(n + 1)

Suzie Starr financed a $1,500 health club membership with an installment loan for  
12 months. The payments were $145 per month, and the total finance charge was $240. 
After 8 months, she decided to pay off the loan. What is the finance charge rebate, and 
what is her loan payoff?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. Rebate fraction:
Set up the rebate fraction by using the sum-of-the-digits formula. Because Suzie already made 
eight payments, she has four payments remaining (12 − 8 = 4).
The numerator will be the sum of the digits of the number of remaining payments, 4.
Sum of the digits of 4 = n(n + 1)
2
= 4(4 + 1)
2
= 4(5)
2
= 20
2 = 10
The denominator will be the sum of the digits of the number of payments, 12.
Sum of the digits of 12 = n(n + 1)
2
= 12(12 + 1)
2
= 12(13)
2
= 156
2
= 78
The rebate fraction is therefore 10
78.
Step 2. Finance charge rebate:
Finance charge rebate = Rebate fraction × Total finance charge
Finance charge rebate = 10
78 × 240
Finance charge rebate = 30.7692 = $30.77
Step 3. Loan payoff:
Loan payoff
=
(Payments remaining × Payment amount) −Finance charge rebate
Loan payoff
=
(4 × 145) −30.77
Loan payoff
=

Solar Energy Although solar energy is 
a relatively new energy source, it may 
become the most important energy source 
of the future. Presently, available tax credits 
and incentives greatly reduce startup costs 
for solar power systems. Some of the major 
advantages of solar power include the fact 
that it is renewable, is nonpolluting, does 
not emit greenhouse gases, and provides 
free energy and heat from the sun.
According to www.sunworkssolar.com, 
by 2016, the U.S. solar industry is expected 
to support more than 440,000 permanent 
full-time jobs.

What are the finance charge and new balance of a 
line of credit with an APR of the current prime rate 
plus 4.6%?
Previous balance = $2,000
Average daily balance = $3,200
Payments = $1,500
Loans = $3,600
Current prime rate = 7%

1. Calculate the amount financed by subtracting the 
down payment from the purchase price.
2. Compute the add-on interest finance charge by 
using I = PRT, with the amount financed as the 
principal.
3. Find the total of the installment payments by 
 adding the interest to the amount financed.
4. Calculate the monthly payment by dividing the 
total of the installment payments by the number of 
months of the loan.
Diane Barber financed a new car with an 8% 
 add-on interest loan. The purchase price of the car 
was $13,540. The bank required a $1,500 down 
payment and equal monthly payments for 48 
months. What are Diane’s monthly payments?
Amount financed = 13,540 −1,500 = $12,040
Interest = 12,040 × .08 × 4 = $3,852.80
Total of installment payments

2. From Table 13-1, scan down the Payments 
 column to the number of payments of the loan.
3. Scan to the right in that row to the table factor  
that most closely corresponds to the finance charge 
per $100.
4. Look to the top of the column containing the 
finance charge per $100 to find the APR of the 
loan.
Steve Moran purchased a home gym for $8,000. 
He made a $1,500 down payment and financed 
the remaining $6,500 for 30 months. If Steve’s 
total finance charge is $1,858, what APR is he 
paying on the loan?
Finance charge per $100 = 1,858 × 100
6,500
= $28.58
From Table 13-1, scan down the Payments 
column to 30. Then scan right to the table factor 
closest to 28.58, which is 28.64. The top of that

1. From Table 13-1, locate the table factor at the 
intersection of the APR and number of payments 
of the loan. This table factor is the finance charge 
per $100.
2. Total finance charge
 
= Amount financed × Table factor
100
3. Monthly payment
 
= Amount financed + Finance charge
Number  of  months  of  the loan
Appliance Mart uses Galaxy Bank to finance 
customer purchases. This month Galaxy is 
offering loans up to 36 months with an APR of 
13.25%. For qualified buyers, no down payment 
is required. If Clark Shaw wants to purchase a 
$2,350 stove using a 36-month loan, what are the 
finance charge and monthly payment of the loan?
From Table 13-1, the table factor for 36 
 payments, 13.25% = 21.73
Total finance charge = 2,350 × 21.73
100
= $510.66
Monthly payment = 2,350.00 + 510.66
36
= $79.46

1. Calculate the rebate fraction by
Rebate fraction =
Sum of the digits of the number  
of remaining payments
Sum of the digits of the total  
number of payments
2. Determine the finance charge rebate by
Finance charge rebate
  = Rebate fraction × Total  finance charge
3. Find the loan payoff by
Loan payoff
= (
Payments 
remaining × Payments

)
Jill Otis financed a $2,000 riding lawn mower 
with an installment loan for 24 months. The 
payments are $98 per month, and the total 
finance charge is $352. After 18 months, Jill 
decides to pay off the loan. What is the finance 
charge rebate, and what is the loan payoff?
Rebate fraction = Sum of the digits of 6
Sum of the digits of 24
Sum of the digits 6 = 6(7)
2
= 21
Sum of the digits 24 = 24(25)
2
= 300
Rebate fraction = 21
300
Finance charge rebate = 21
300 × 352 = $24.64
Loan payoff = (6 × 98) −24.64
= 588.00 −24.64 = $563.36

Amount financed = Purchase price −Down payment
Amount financed = 12,500 −1,875 = $10,625
Total amount of installment payments = Monthly payment × Number of payments
Total amount of installment payments = 309.90 × 48 = $14,875.20
Finance charge = Total amount of installment payments −Amount financed
Finance charge = 14,875.20 −10,625.00 = $4,250.20

Up, Up, and Away!
Ultralight aircraft provide an exciting and 
affordable flying solution for many people. They 
allow you to own an aircraft that doesn’t require 
an expensive hangar or a special pilot license; 
and, best of all, you can haul it with your car or 
truck.
Ultralights are defined by the U.S. FAA as a 
single-seat vehicle of less than 5 U.S. gallons 
of fuel capacity, empty weight of less than 254 
pounds, and a top speed of 64 mph. Restrictions 
include flying only during daylight hours over 
unpopulated areas. Quicksilver and Buckeye 
Corporations are the industry leaders in ultra-
light and powered parachute-type aircraft.

BUSINESS DECISION: PURCHASE VS. LEASE
16. You are interested in getting a Nissan Rogue. You have decided to look into leasing to see how 
it compares with buying. In recent years, you have noticed that advertised lease payments are 
considerably lower than those advertised for financing a purchase. It always seemed as if you 
would be getting “more car for the money!”
In your research, you have found that a closed-end vehicle lease is an agreement in which you 
make equal monthly payments based on your estimated usage for a set period of time. Then you 
turn the vehicle back in to the leasing dealer. No equity, no ownership, no asset at the end! You 
also have the option of purchasing the vehicle at an agreed-upon price. Leasing terminology is 
different from that of purchasing, but they are related.

Residual value
Use the advertisement below and the Purchase vs. Lease Worksheet on page 450 to compare 
the total cost of each option. The residual value of the car is estimated to be $13,650. The lease 
has no termination fees or charges. If you decide to purchase, your bank requires a down pay-
ment of $3,800 and will finance the balance with a 10.25% APR loan for 36 months. The sales 
tax in your state is 6.5%, and the tag and title charges are $75. The opportunity cost is the inter-
est your down payment could have earned if you didn’t purchase the vehicle. Currently, your 
money earns 4.5% in a savings account.

Getting into – or out of – a lease
Sites such as LeaseTrader.com and  
www.Swapalease.com match people eager 
to escape a vehicle lease (without pay-
ing huge termination fees) with bargain 
 hunters looking to avoid dealer fees and a 
down payment by assuming a lease for its 
 remaining term.
t For sellers – Brokerage fees range from 
$100 to $240. Some lease companies still 
hold you liable for damage and unpaid 
fees after the transfer.
t For buyers – Some sellers will pay you to 
take over the lease. Check the mileage 
allowed and get the vehicle inspected 
before you sign.

MORTGAGES—FIXED-RATE AND ADJUSTABLE-RATE
Real estate is defined as “land, including the air above and the earth below, plus any perma-
nent improvements to the land, such as homes, apartment buildings, factories, hotels, shop-
ping centers, or any other ‘real’ property.” Whether for commercial or residential property, 
practically all real estate transactions today involve some type of financing. The mortgage 
loan is the most popular method of financing real estate purchases.
A mortgage is any loan in which real property is used as security for a debt. During the 
term of the loan, the property becomes security, or collateral, for the lender, sufficient to 
ensure recovery of the amount loaned.
Mortgages today fall into one of three categories: FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed, and 
conventional. The National Housing Act of 1934 created the Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA) to encourage reluctant lenders to invest their money in the mortgage market, thereby 
stimulating the depressed construction industry. Today the FHA is a government agency 
within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The FHA insures private 
mortgage loans made by approved lenders.
In 1944, the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act (GI Bill of Rights) was passed to help 
returning World War II veterans purchase homes. Special mortgages were established known 
as Veterans Affairs (VA) mortgages or GI Loans. Under this and subsequent legislation, the 
government guarantees payment of a mortgage loan made by a private lender to a veteran/
buyer should the veteran default on the loan.
VA loans may be used by eligible veterans, surviving spouses, and active service mem-
bers to buy, construct, or refinance homes, farm residences, or condominiums. Down pay-
ments by veterans are not required but are left to the discretion of lenders, whereas FHA and 
conventional loans require a down payment from all buyers.
Conventional loans are made by private lenders and generally have a higher interest rate 
than either an FHA or VA loan. Most conventional lenders are restricted to loaning 80% of 
the appraised value of a property, thus requiring a 20% down payment. If the borrower agrees 
to pay the premium for private mortgage insurance (PMI), the conventional lender can lend 
up to 95% of the appraised value of the property.
Historically, high interest rates in the early 1980s caused mortgage payments to skyrocket 
beyond the financial reach of the average home buyer. To revitalize the slumping mort-
gage industry, the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) was created. These are mortgage loans 
under which the interest rate is periodically adjusted to more closely coincide with changing 
real estate Land, including any permanent 
improvements such as homes, apartment 
 buildings, factories, hotels, shopping centers, or 
any other “real” structures.

by private lenders that are not FHA-insured or 
VA-guaranteed.
private mortgage insurance (PMI)  
A special form of insurance primarily on 
 mortgages for single-family homes, allowing 
the buyer to borrow more by putting down a 
smaller down payment.
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)  
A mortgage loan in which the interest rate 
changes periodically, usually in relation to a 
 predetermined economic index.
Mortgage loans are the most common 
form of loan made for real estate property

economic conditions. ARMs are very attractive, particularly to first-time buyers, because a 
low teaser rate may be offered for the first few years and then adjusted upward to a higher rate 
later in the loan. Today the adjustable-rate mortgage has become the most widely accepted 
option to the traditional 15- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.
Extra charges known as mortgage discount points are frequently added to the cost of a 
loan as a rate adjustment factor. This allows lenders to increase their yield without showing 
an increase in the mortgage interest rate. Each discount point is equal to 1% of the amount 
of the loan.
By their nature, mortgage loans involve large amounts of money and long periods of time. 
Consequently, the monthly payments and the amount of interest paid over the years can be 
considerable. Exhibit 14-1 illustrates the 30-year mortgage rates in the United States from 
1974 to 2010 and the monthly payment on a $100,000 mortgage at various interest rate levels.
In reality, the higher interest mortgages would have been refinanced as rates declined, but 
consider the “housing affordability” factor. In 1982, payments on a $100,000 mortgage were 
$1,548 per month, compared with $457 in 2010!
In this section, you learn to calculate the monthly payments of a mortgage and prepare a 
partial amortization schedule of that loan. You also calculate the amount of property tax and 
insurance required as part of each monthly payment. In addition, you learn about the closing, 
the all-important final step in a real estate transaction, and the calculation of the closing costs. 
Finally, you learn about the important components of an adjustable-rate mortgage: the index, 
the lender’s margin, the interest rate, and the cost caps.
CALCULATING THE MONTHLY PAYMENT AND TOTAL 
INTEREST PAID ON A FIXED-RATE MORTGAGE
In Chapter 12, we learned that amortization is the process of paying off a financial obligation 
in a series of equal, regular payments over a period of time. We calculated the amount of an 
amortization payment by using the present value of an annuity table or the optional amortiza-
tion formula.
Because mortgages run for relatively long periods of time, we can also use a special 
present-value table in which the periods are listed in years. The table factors represent the 
monthly payment required per $1,000 of debt to amortize a mortgage. The monthly payment 
includes mortgage interest and an amount to reduce the principal. (See Table 14-1.)
mortgage discount points Extra  
charges frequently added to the cost of a 
 mortgage, allowing lenders to increase their 
yield without showing an increase in the 
 mortgage interest rate.

and seller of real estate conclude all matters

As a result of declining mortgage rates in 
recent years, a record 68.8% of families own 
their own homes today. That amounts to 
nearly 76 million households.
Purchasing and financing a home is one 
of the most important financial decisions a 
person will ever make. Substantial research 
should be done and much care taken in 
choosing the correct time to buy, the right 
property to buy, and the best financial offer 
to accept. (See Exhibit 14-2, “Mortgage 
Shopping Worksheet,” pages 459–460.)

Remember that the table values represent 
monthly payments “per $1,000” financed. 
When calculating the amount of the monthly 
payment, you must first determine the 
 number of $1,000s being financed, then 
 multiply that figure by the table factor.

PREPARING A PARTIAL AMORTIZATION  
SCHEDULE OF A MORTGAGE
Mortgages used to purchase residential property generally require regular, equal payments. 
A portion of the payment is used to pay interest on the loan; the balance of the payment is 
used to reduce the principal. This type of mortgage is called a level-payment plan because 
the amount of the payment remains the same for the duration of the loan. The amount of the 
payment that is interest gradually decreases, while the amount that reduces the debt gradually 
increases.

STEPS
  TO FIND THE MONTHLY MORTGAGE PAYMENT BY USING 
AN  AMORTIZATION TABLE AND TO FIND TOTAL INTEREST
45&1 Find the number of $1,000s financed.
Number of $1,000s financed = Amount financed
1,000
45&1 Using Table 14-1, locate the table factor, monthly payment per $1,000 
financed, at the intersection of the number-of-years column and the interest-
rate row.
45&1 Calculate the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Number of $1,000s financed × Table factor
45&1 Find the total interest of the loan.
Total interest = (Monthly payment × Number of payments) −Amount financed
What is the monthly payment and total interest on a $150,000 mortgage at 5% for  
30 years?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. 
Number of $1,000s financed = Amount financed
1,000
= 150,000
1,000
= 150
Step 2. Table factor for 5%, 30 years is 5.37.
Step 3.
 
Monthly payment = Number of $1,000s financed × Table factor
Monthly payment = 150 × 5.37
Monthly payment = $805.50
Step 4.
 
Total interest = (Monthly payment × Number of payments) −Amount financed
Total interest = (805.50 × 360) −150,000
Total interest = 289,980 −150,000
Total interest = $139,980

and the outstanding balance of the loan.
An amortization schedule is a chart that shows the status of the mortgage loan after each 
payment. The schedule illustrates month by month how much of the mortgage payment is 
interest and how much is left to reduce to principal. The schedule also shows the outstanding 
balance of the loan after each payment.
In reality, amortization schedules are long because they show the loan status for each 
month. A 30-year mortgage, for example, would require a schedule with 360 lines (12 months ×  
30 years = 360 payments).
Prepare an amortization schedule for the first three months of the $150,000 mortgage 
at 5% for 30 years from Example 1. Remember, you have already calculated the monthly 
payment to be $805.50.
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. $805.50 (from Example 1, page 455)
Step 2. Month 1:
Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
Interest = 150,000 × .05 × 1
12
Interest = $625.00
Step 3.
 
Portion of payment reducing principal = Monthly payment −Interest
Portion of payment reducing principal = 805.50 −625.00
Portion of payment reducing principal = $180.50
Step 4.
 
Outstanding balance = Previous balance −Portion of payment reducing principal
Outstanding balance = 150,000.00 −180.50
Outstanding balance after one payment = $149,819.50
Step 5. Repeat Steps 2, 3, and 4, for two more payments and enter the values on the schedule.
Month 2:
Interest = 149,819.50 × .05 × 1
12 = $624.25
 
(Note: Although very slightly, interest decreased.)

In most cases, mortgage interest expense is 
tax-deductible. To increase your  deductions 
for the current year, make your January 
mortgage payment by December 20. This will 
allow time for the payment to be  credited 
to your account in December,  giving you an 
extra month of interest deduction this year.

CALCULATING THE MONTHLY PITI OF A MORTGAGE LOAN
In reality, mortgage payments include four parts: principal, interest, taxes, and insurance—
thus the abbreviation PITI. VA, FHA, and most conventional loans require borrowers to pay 
1
12 of the estimated annual property taxes and hazard insurance with each month’s mortgage 
payment. Each month the taxes and insurance portions of the payment are placed in a type of 
savings account for safekeeping known as an escrow account. Each year when the property 
taxes and hazard insurance premiums are due, the lender disburses those payments from the 
borrower’s escrow account. During the next 12 months, the account again builds up to pay 
the next year’s taxes and insurance.

Lorie Kojian purchased a home with a mortgage of $87,500 at 7.5% for 30 years. The 
property taxes are $2,350 per year, and the hazard insurance premium is $567.48. What 
is the monthly PITI payment of Lorie’s loan?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
Step 1. From the amortization table, Table 14-1, the factor for 7.5%, 30 years is 7.00. When 
we divide the amount of Lorie’s loan by 1,000, we get 87.5 as the number of 1,000s 
financed. The principal and interest portion, PI, is therefore 87.5 × 7.00 = $612.50.
Step 2.
 
Monthly TI = Estimated property tax + Hazard insurance
12
Monthly TI = 2,350.00 + 567.48
12
= 2,917.48
12
= $243.12
Step 3.
 
Monthly PITI = PI + TI
Monthly PITI = 612.50 + 243.12
Monthly PITI = $855.62

UNDERSTANDING CLOSING COSTS AND CALCULATING 
THE AMOUNT DUE AT CLOSING
The term closing or settlement is used to describe the final step in a real estate transaction. 
This is a meeting at which time documents are signed; the buyer pays the agreed-upon pur-
chase price; and the seller delivers the title, or right of ownership, to the buyer. The official 
document conveying ownership is known as the deed.
Closing costs are the expenses incurred in conjunction with the sale of real estate. In 
the typical real estate transaction, both the buyer and the seller are responsible for a number 
of costs that are paid for at the time of closing. The party obligated for paying a particular 
closing cost is often determined by local custom or by negotiation. Some closing costs are 
expressed as dollar amounts, whereas others are a percent of the amount financed or amount 
of the purchase price.
At closing, the buyer is responsible for the purchase price (mortgage + down payment) 
plus closing costs. The amount received by the seller after all expenses have been paid is 
known as the proceeds. The settlement statement or closing statement is a document, usu-
ally prepared by an attorney, that provides a detailed breakdown of the real estate transaction. 
This document itemizes closing costs and indicates how they are allocated between the buyer 
and the seller.
Exhibit 14-2, “Mortgage Shopping Worksheet,” can be used to compare mortgage offers 
from various lenders. It provides a comprehensive checklist of important loan information, 
typical fees, closing and settlement costs, and other questions and considerations people 
should be aware of when shopping for a mortgage loan.

title or deed The official document 
 representing the right of ownership of real 
property.
closing costs Expenses incurred in 
 conjunction with the sale of real estate, 
 including loan origination fees, credit reports, 
appraisal fees, title search, title insurance, 
 inspections, attorney’s fees, recording fees,  
and broker’s commission.
settlement or closing statement  
A  document that provides a detailed  accounting 
of payments, credits, and closing costs of a real 
estate transaction.
Typically, over the years of a mortgage, 
property taxes and insurance premiums 
rise. When this happens, the lender must 
increase the portion set aside in the escrow 
account by increasing the taxes and 
insurance parts of the monthly payment.

The amount of interest paid and the length 
of a mortgage can be dramatically reduced 
by making biweekly payments (every two 
weeks) instead of monthly. By choosing this 
mortgage payment option, you are taking 
advantage of the all-important “time value of 
money” concept.
Here’s an example. A 30-year, 7% 
mortgage for $100,000 has monthly 
payments of $666. The total interest you will 
pay on the loan is $139,509. If, instead, you 
make biweekly payments of $333, you would 
pay off the loan in 23 years and the total 
interest would be $103,959. The biweekly 
option saves you $35,550 in  interest and 
seven years of payments!
To see how this option can be applied to 
your mortgage, go to www.bankrate.com 
and type biweekly mortgage calculator in the 
search box.

CALCULATING THE INTEREST RATE  
OF AN ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE (ARM)
With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate stays the same during the life of the loan. With 
an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate changes periodically, usually in relation 
to an index, and payments may go up or down accordingly. In recent years, the ARM has 
become the most widely accepted alternative to the traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.
The primary components of an ARM are the index, lender’s margin, calculated interest 
rate, initial interest rate, and cost caps. With most ARMs, the interest rate and monthly pay-
ment change every year, every three years, or every five years. The period between one rate 
change and the next is known as the adjustment period. A loan with an adjustment period of 
one year, for example, is called a one-year ARM.
Most lenders tie ARM interest rate changes to changes in an index rate. These indexes 
usually go up and down with the general movement of interest rates in the nation’s economy. 
When the index goes up, so does the mortgage rate, resulting in higher monthly payments. 
When the index goes down, the mortgage rate may or may not go down.

adjustment period  The amount of time 
between one rate change and the next on an

three years.

the interest rate on an adjustable-rate  
mortgage is tied.

To calculate the interest rate on an ARM, lenders add a few points called the lender’s 
margin or spread to the index rate. The amount of the margin can differ among lenders and 
can make a significant difference in the amount of interest paid over the life of a loan.
Calculated ARM interest rate = Index rate + Lender’s margin
The calculated or initial ARM interest rate is usually the rate to which all future adjust-
ments and caps apply, although this rate may be discounted by the lender during the first 
payment period to attract and qualify more potential borrowers. This low initial interest rate, 
sometimes known as a teaser rate, is one of the main appeals of the ARM; however, without 
some protection from rapidly rising interest rates, borrowers might be put in a position of not 
being able to afford the rising mortgage payments. To prevent this situation, standards have 
been established requiring limits or caps on increases.
Interest-rate caps place a limit on the amount the interest rate can increase. These may 
come in the form of periodic rate caps, which limit the increase from one adjustment period 
to the next, and overall rate caps, which limit the increase over the life of the mortgage. The 
following formulas can be used to find the maximum interest rates of an ARM:
Maximum rate per adjustment period = Previous rate + Periodic rate cap
Maximum overall ARM rate = Initial rate + Overall rate cap
lender’s margin or spread The percentage 
points added to an index rate to get the interest 
rate of an adjustable-rate mortgage.
calculated or initial ARM interest 
rate The interest rate of an adjustable-rate 
mortgage to which all future adjustments and 
caps apply.
teaser rate A discounted interest rate for the 
first adjustment period of an adjustable-rate 
mortgage that is below the current market rate 
of interest.
interest-rate caps Limits on the amount the 
interest rate can increase on an ARM.
periodic rate caps Limits on the amount the 
interest rate of an ARM can increase per adjust-
ment period.
overall rate caps Limits on the amount the 
interest rate of an ARM can increase over the life 
of the loan.

Florence Powers bought a home with an adjustable-rate mortgage. The lender’s margin 
on the loan is 2.5%, and the overall rate cap is 6% over the life of the loan.
a. If the current index rate is 4.9%, what is the calculated interest rate of the ARM?
b. What is the maximum overall rate of the loan?
SOLUTIONSTRATEGY
a. Because the loan interest rate is tied to an index, we use the formula
Calculated ARM interest rate = Index rate + Lender’s margin
Calculated ARM interest rate = 4.9% + 2.5%
Calculated ARM interest rate = 7.4%
 b. 
Maximum overall rate = Calculated rate + Overall rate cap
Maximum overall rate = 7.4% + 6%
Maximum overall rate = 13.4%

SECOND MORTGAGES—HOME EQUITY LOANS 
AND LINES OF CREDIT
In recent years, the “housing crisis” brought on by the economic recession has taken a toll 
on homeowners. In 2010, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that more than 1 in 
10 homeowners with a mortgage were in foreclosure or were behind in their payments. (See 
Exhibit 14-3.)
Despite these statistics, homeowners today may use the equity in their homes to qualify 
for a sizable amount of credit at interest rates that are historically low. In addition, under 
existing law, the interest may be tax-deductible because the debt is secured by the home.
A home equity loan is a lump-sum second mortgage loan based on the available equity in 
a home. A home equity line of credit is a form of revolving credit also based on the available 
equity. Because the home is likely to be a consumer’s largest asset, many homeowners use 
these loans and credit lines only for major expenditures such as debt consolidation, education, 
home improvements, business expansion, medical bills, and vacations.
With home equity lines of credit, the borrower will be approved for a specific amount of 
credit known as the credit limit. This is the maximum amount that can be borrowed at any 
one time on that line of credit.
CALCULATING THE POTENTIAL AMOUNT  
OF CREDIT AVAILABLE TO A BORROWER
Most lenders set the credit limit on a home equity loan or line by taking a percentage of the 
appraised value of the house and subtracting the balance owed on the existing mortgage. In 
determining your actual credit limit, the lender also will consider your ability to repay by 
looking at your income, debts, and other financial obligations as well as your credit history.

mortgage loan based on the available equity  
in a home.

CALCULATING THE HOUSING EXPENSE RATIO AND THE 
TOTAL OBLIGATIONS RATIO OF A BORROWER
Mortgage lenders use ratios to determine whether borrowers have the economic ability to 
repay the loan. FHA, VA, and conventional lenders all use monthly gross income as the base 
for calculating these qualifying ratios. Two important ratios used for this purpose are the 
housing expense ratio and the total obligations ratio. These ratios are expressed as percents 
and are calculated by using the following formulas:
Housing expense ratio = Monthly housing expense (PITI)
Monthly gross income
Total obligations ratio = Total monthly financial obligations
Monthly gross income
The mortgage business uses widely accepted guidelines for these ratios that should not be 
exceeded. The ratio guidelines are shown in Exhibit 14-4.

In 2010, the signing of the financial reform 
bill into law meant real financial reform had 
finally become a reality. Almost two years 
after the near collapse of the financial system, 
Congress put new rules in place to prevent 
the abusive lending practices responsible for 
the crisis. Highlights of the new law include:
t A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(CFPB) to stop unfair lending practices
t Governmental authority to step in and 
safely shut down failing financial firms
t Prohibitions on abusive mortgage lending 
practices such as kickbacks for steering 
people into high-rate loans when they 
qualify for lower rates
t Stronger foreclosure prevention, including 
an emergency loan fund to help families 
at risk of losing their home because of 
unemployment or illness

Mortgage brokers are real estate financing 
professionals acting as the intermediary 
between consumers and lenders during 
mortgage transactions. A mortgage broker 
works with consumers to help them through 
the complex mortgage origination process.
 
Brokers earn commissions in exchange for 
bringing borrowers and lenders together and 
receive payment when the mortgage loan is 
closed.

BUSINESS DECISION:  DOES IT PAY TO REFINANCE  
YOUR MORTGAGE?
22. According to money.CNN.com, with mortgage rates near 35-year lows, you may be able to cut 
your payments sharply by refinancing your loan. To qualify for the best rates, you need a credit 
score of 740 or higher and usually at least 20% equity.
Even if you have to settle for a higher rate, a new loan may save you money. The main consider-
ation is whether you will live in your home long enough to offset the refinance closing costs.
Your current mortgage payment is $1,458.50 per month, with a balance of $214,800. You have a 
chance to refinance at the Biltmore Bank with a 30-year, 5.5% mortgage. The closing costs of the 
loan are application fee, $90; credit report, $165; title insurance, .4% of the amount financed; title 
search, $360; and attorney’s fees, $580.
You plan to live in your home for at least four more years. Use the Mortgage Refinancing 
Worksheet below to see if it makes sense to refinance your mortgage.

appropriately.
Prepare an amortization schedule for the first 
month of a $70,000 mortgage at 9% for 20 years.
Using Table 14-1, we find the monthly payment 
of the mortgage to be $630.
Month 1:
Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
Interest = 70,000 × .09 × 1
12
Interest = $525
Portion of payment reducing principal
630 −525 = $105
Outstanding balance after one payment
70,000 −105 = $69,895
An amortization schedule can now be prepared 
from these data.

Calculating the Monthly  
PITI of a Mortgage Loan
Performance Objective 
14-3, Page 457
In reality, mortgage payments include four elements: 
principal, interest, taxes, and insurance—thus the 
 abbreviation PITI.
Monthly PITI of a mortgage:
1. Calculate the principal and interest portion (PI)  
of the payment as before using Table 14-1.
2. Calculate the monthly tax and insurance portion 
(TI) by
 
Monthly TI = 
Estimated  
properly tax + Hazard 
insurance
12
3. Calculate the total monthly PITI by
 
Monthly PITI = Monthly PI + Monthly TI
Maureen Cassidy purchased a home for $97,500 
with a mortgage at 8.5% for 15 years. The prop-
erty taxes are $1,950 per year, and the hazard 
insurance premium is $466. What is the monthly 
PITI payment of Maureen’s loan?
Using a table factor of 9.85 from Table 14-1, 
we find the monthly PI for this 8.5%, 15-year 
mortgage to be $960.38.
Monthly TI
= 1,950 + 466
12
= 2,416
12
= $201.33
Monthly PITI = PI + TI
= 960.38 + 201.33 = $1,161.71
Calculating the Amount  
Due at Closing
Performance Objective 
14-4, Page 458
Closing costs are the expenses incurred in  
conjunction with the sale of real estate. Both  
buyer and seller are responsible for specific costs.
The party responsible for paying a particular  
closing cost is often determined by local custom  
or by negotiation.
Some closing costs are expressed as dollar  
amounts, whereas others are a percent of the  
amount financed or amount of the purchase price.
At closing, the buyer is responsible for the  
purchase price (mortgage and down payment)  
plus closing costs.
The amount received by the seller after all expenses 
have been paid is known as the proceeds.
Typical Closing Costs
Buyer: Attorney’s fee, inspections, credit report, 
appraisal fee, hazard insurance premium, title 
exam and insurance premium, escrow fee, prepaid 
taxes, and interest
Seller: Attorney’s fee, broker’s commission, 
survey expense, inspections, abstract of title,  
certificate of title, escrow fee, prepayment 
penalty—existing loan, documentary stamps
Calculating the Interest 
Rate of an Adjustable-Rate 
Mortgage (ARM)
Performance Objective 
14-5, Page 461
Use the following formulas to find the various  
components of an ARM:
Calculated  
interest rate
Max rate per  
period
Maximum overall 
rate of ARM
= Initial rate + Overall cap
= Previous rate + Periodic cap
= Index rate + Lender’s margin
Howard Gold bought a home with an adjustable-
rate mortgage. The margin on the loan is 3.5%, 
and the rate cap is 8% over the life of the loan. If 
the current index rate is 3.6%, what is the calcu-
lated interest rate and the maximum overall rate 
of the loan?
Calculated interest rate = 3.6% + 3.5% = 7.1%
Maximum overall rate = 7.1% + 8% = 15.1%

Calculating the Potential 
Amount of Credit Available 
to a Borrower
Performance Objective 14-6, 
Page 467
Most lenders set the credit limit on a home equity 
loan or line by taking a percentage of the appraised 
value of the home and subtracting the balance owed 
on the existing first mortgage. In determining your 
actual credit limit, the lender also will consider your 
ability to repay by looking at your income, debts, 
and other financial obligations, as well as your credit 
 history.
Potential amount of credit available to borrower:
1. Calculate the percentage of appraised value by
Percentage of 
appraised value= Appraised 
value
× Lender’s 
percentage
2. Find the potential amount of credit available by
Potential  
credit
= Percentage of 
appraised value – First mortgage 
debt
The McCartneys own a home that was recently 
appraised for $134,800. The balance on their 
existing first mortgage is $76,550. If their bank is 
willing to loan up to 70% of the appraised value, 
what is the amount of credit available to the 
McCartneys on a home equity loan?
Percentage of appraisal value = 134,800 × .70
= $94,360
Available credit = 94,360 −76,550 = $17,810

Calculating the Housing 
Expense Ratio and the 
Total Obligations Ratio of a 
Borrower
Performance Objective 14-7, 
Page 468
Mortgage lenders use ratios to determine whether 
borrowers have the economic ability to repay the 
loan. Two important ratios used for this purpose are 
the housing expense ratio and the total obligations 
ratio. These ratios are expressed as percents and are 
calculated by using the following formulas:
Housing  
expense  
ratio
Total  
obligations  
ratio
= Total monthly financial obligations
Monthly gross income
= Monthly housing expense (PITI)
Monthly gross income
Vickie Howard earns a gross income of $3,750 
per month. She has made application for a mort-
gage with a monthly PITI of $956. Vickie has 
other financial obligations totaling $447  
per month.
a. What is her housing expense ratio?
b. What is her total obligations ratio?
c. According to the Lending Ratio Guidelines on 
page 468, for what type of mortgage would 
Vickie qualify, if any?
Housing expense ratio = 956
3,750 = 25.5%
Total obligation ratio = 1,403
3,750 = 37.4%
According to the Lending Ratio Guidelines, 
Vickie would qualify for an FHA mortgage but 
not a conventional mortgage; her total obligations 
ratio is 37.4%, which is above the limit for  
conventional mortgages.

COLLABORATIVE LEARNING ACTIVITY
The Hypothetical Mortgage
Speak with the loan officers at mortgage lending institutions in your area and ask for their help with a 
business math class project.
Your assignment is to research the various types of financing deals currently being offered for a 
hypothetical condominium you plan to buy. The following assumptions apply to this project:
r
The purchase price of the condo you plan to buy is $200,000.
r
The condo was recently appraised for $220,000.
r
You plan to make a 25% down payment ($50,000) and are seeking a $150,000 mortgage.
r
You have a job that qualifies you for that size mortgage.
As a team, your assignment is to compare the current interest rates, costs, and features associated 
with a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and an adjustable-rate mortgage.
a. What are the current interest rates and discount points of the 15- and 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages?
b. What are the monthly payments of the fixed-rate mortgages?
c. What is the initial (teaser) rate, discount points, adjustment period, rate caps, margin, and 
index for the adjustable-rate mortgage?
d. What are the fees or charges for the loan application, property appraisal, survey, credit 
report, inspections, title search, title insurance, and document preparation?
e. What other charges or fees can be expected at closing?
f. Which type of mortgage does your team think is the best deal at this time? Why?
g. Which bank would you choose for the mortgage? Why?
