Basic Resume Tips: 
 
 
 
Include All Your Contact Information 
 
It's important to include all your contact information on your resume so employers can easily get in touch 
with you. Include your full name, street address, city, state, and zip, home phone number, cell phone 
number, and email address.

 
Add a Profile or Objective 
 
 
 
If you include an objective on your resume, it's important to tailor it to match the job you are applying 
for. The more specific you are, the better chance you have of being considered for the job you are 
interested in, or consider using a resume profile, with or without a headline, instead. 
 
 
 
 
Include Resume Keywords 
 
 
 
Your resume should include the same keywords that appear in job descriptions. That way, you will 
increase your chances of your resume matching available positions - and of you being selected for an 
interview. Also include keywords in your cover letter.
